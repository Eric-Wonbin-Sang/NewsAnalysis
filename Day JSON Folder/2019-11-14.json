      "bodyText": "Australian judge Geoffrey Muecke is reluctant to go on the record. It is \u201canathema\u201d to him that any judge, retired or active, would speak publicly on a case they had heard. But he feels he has no choice. \u201cI\u2019m appalled by the way the Nauruan government has treated 19 of their own citizens and have regarded them as guilty and being deserving of the maximum sentence of imprisonment which can be imposed, without even lifting a finger to try and see they receive a fair trial in their own country,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI\u2019m only speaking out now because I think the Nauru 19\u2019s story deserves to be known by the wider community in the democratic and civilised part of our world, and that hasn\u2019t to my mind happened sufficiently.\u201d For more than four years, the group known as the Nauru 19 has been targeted in extraordinary ways. They have faced serious criminal charges, been denied legal assistance and access to external lawyers, been subject to blacklists and travel bans, and allegedly denied access to medical treatment. It began in 2015, when demonstrators \u2013 including current or former MPs and presidents \u2013 gathered outside Nauru\u2019s parliament following the expulsion of three members who had criticised the government in foreign media, amid allegations of corruption and the sacking and deportation of two judges. Police pushed back and the protest spread to the nearby airport runway and forced the diversion of a plane. Rocks were thrown through windows. Police arrested a number of protesters including Mathew Batsiua, one of the suspended MPs, and later two other opposition MPs, Squire Jeremiah and Sprent Dabwido. The 46-year-old Dabwido, who served as the country\u2019s president from 2011 to 2013, died of cancer in Australia in May after seeking asylum and treatment in Australia. Charges of unlawful assembly, riot and disturbing the legislature were laid and a group of 19 were prosecuted. The case split two ways as three pleaded guilty but most sought to defend themselves. Muecke, who was contracted by the Nauruan government to hear the criminal case against 19 Nauruan protesters and politicians, says he now regards the group as among his heroes. \u201cThey deserve at least someone who has been around and seen what happened to say something in support of them.\u201d \u2018We expect the courts to convict these criminals\u2019 The government\u2019s response to the guilty pleas astounded Muecke. \u201cThe minister for justice stood up in court one day and said \u2026 we expect the courts to convict these criminals and lock them up for the maximum sentence allowed,\u201d Muecke says. He says the minister also reminded the sentencing magistrate that her contract was coming up for renewal in coming months, and suggested the president might base his decision on her ruling. \u201cThat was said in open parliament,\u201d Muecke says. \u201cThree weeks later, the magistrate sentenced these three to quite modest sentences, to her great credit. Her contract was not renewed and she went back to the Solomon Islands.\u201d The government appealed what they said were \u201cmanifestly inadequate\u201d sentences and the supreme court increased them \u2013 in one case by 700%. The trio appealed to Australia\u2019s high court, designated under a bilateral treaty as the highest avenue of appeal for Nauruans, which sent the case back to the supreme court, only to have it increase their sentences again. They relaunched another appeal but unbeknown to the public, in December 2017 the Nauruan government had given its Australian counterpart the required 90 days notice that it was ending the 43-year-old treaty. By the time the public found out, the three months had lapsed, cutting off access to the high court with no alternative appeal court yet established. Some months later a court of appeal was established with far broader scope than the high court and a pool of judges from across the Pacific \u2013 an established practice in the region. Asked if he believes this was linked to the Nauru 19 case, Muecke replies: \u201cAbsolutely\u201d. \u201cIt was the only link. That was why they did it.\u201d The Nauruan government has been contacted for comment. Over the years it has forcefully rejected any criticism, accusing critical reports of seeking to \u201cdenigrate the legal system\u201d and [insult] members of our judiciary\u201d. \u2018Shameful affront to the rule of law\u2019 Muecke was hired by the Nauruan government as an independent judge to hear the criminal case against those who pleaded not guilty but things did not go as the government hoped. In September 2018, he ordered a permanent stay of prosecution, finding that the government had gone to such extraordinary lengths to see the demonstrators punished, which he described as \u201cshameful affront to the rule of law\u201d, that there was no chance of a fair trial. Muecke found the government was operating a blacklist preventing the group from gaining employment or income from housing, was acting in ways contrary to the rule of law, and that the then minister for justice was deliberately attempting to influence the courts. \u201cThe findings I made on the evidence before me convinced me that the government of Nauru was going to do all that it could, including affronting every rule of law that was necessary, to ensure that these people who they regarded as criminals, should not get a fair trial and should be convicted and sentenced for severe lengths of imprisonment,\u201d Muecke says. \u201cEverything the government of Nauru did was directed towards that aim.\u201d The government responded that his ruling was \u201cwrong in law and needed to be corrected\u201d. Muecke also ordered the government to pay more than $220,000 in legal fees to allow the group their right to a legal defence. The government didn\u2019t appeal the order. First it denied it existed, then, according to Muecke, it just ignored it. Three days after his ruling Muecke\u2019s contract was terminated. His ruling that no trial go ahead \u2013 delivered the day before he left the country \u2013 did him out of a job. And he says the government still hasn\u2019t paid him around $6,000 for the one he had already done. \u201cThe money doesn\u2019t matter all that much,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat matters more is that the judiciary who are asked or invited into this country, or any country, should not go in thinking they will only get paid if they make the right decision.\u201d Ten months later Muecke\u2019s ruling was taken to the new court of appeal, which overturned it and ordered a retrial. Lead defendant Batsiua noted at the time the court did not find against Muecke\u2019s findings about the misconduct of the Nauruan government. \u201cAs I see it we are basically back to square one,\u201d he said. Last week the retrial judge, Daniel Fatiaki \u2013 a controversial former chief justice of Fiji \u2013 rejected applications for another permanent stay and for the defendants to have a government-funded defence. Fatiaki told the court he believed Nauru had no fundamental right to a defence and that \u201ca criminal trial in this country can begin, continue and end without a defendant being represented\u201d. He ordered the new trial to start this week with only one fundamentally unprepared legal aid officer to represent all 15. At least two members fled the country before a travel ban was declared. Squire Jeremiah and his cousin Rutherford Jeremiah have sought political asylum in Australia, joining the wife of the late Sprent Dabwido. \u2018Nauru should be looked at in a different way\u2019 Nauru\u2019s economy is almost entirely reliant on its arrangement with Australia to detain, process and host asylum seekers. Integral to the Australian government\u2019s infamously tough stance on refugees, Nauru has become increasingly emboldened in exercising its sovereignty in ways antithetical to rule-of-law democracies. The country might not have Australia\u2019s explicit approval for what it\u2019s doing to its own citizens but it doesn\u2019t have its disapproval either. The Australian government, which has been contacted for comment, has been conspicuously silent on the actions of two successive governments, even when that included tearing up the decades old treaty. \u201cThe Australian government say they\u2019re not going to get involved in \u2026 the domestic affairs of any other country,\u201d Muecke says. \u201cThere\u2019s force in that but Nauru perhaps should be looked at in a different way.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what the answer is, and I accept that both governments are in a bind politically and financially. I\u2019d have hoped our government would have done something in the public domain to put a bit of pressure on the Nauruan government to observe the rule of law.\u201d A new prison widely believed to have been built \u2013 with Australian funding \u2013 for the sole purpose of detaining the Nauru 19 has recently opened. Muecke says he believes his commission by the Nauruan government technically contracts him to hear the new trial but accepts that is not happening. \u201cI never thought for a moment that I might have to leave my judicial independence and integrity at home and not pack that to go to Nauru,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought it was a country like all others, where the rule of law applied and I would sit and make my decision according to law and without fear or favour, affection or ill will. That\u2019s the oath all judges make.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "For bleary-eyed Socceroos fans braving an inhospitable midmorning kick-off it was perhaps a tale of smug self-satisfaction, followed by increasingly bewildered self-accusation. In what was billed as Australia\u2019s toughest assignment of AFC second round qualifying, given Jordan\u2019s status as the Socceroos\u2019 bogey side, for 45 minutes Australia appeared imperious. They were cool, clinical, in control. Everything fans would have wanted to see. The Socceroos enjoyed almost two-thirds of possession, out-passed their opponents nearly two-to-one and didn\u2019t concede a single shot on target. Adam Taggart\u2019s well-taken 13th-minute goal was precisely the play for which Socceroos tragics have been crying out. From deep, a pass from James Jeggo to find Jackson Irvine, a sharp turn and immediate look forward and then an even better ball to find the run of the K-League joint-top scorer. One deft finish, off two incisive vertical passes. Jordan\u2019s centre-backs bisected with geometric precision \u2013 the kind of move that takes the sting out of a vocal home crowd, and reassures teammates that the game is very much going to plan. For Graham Arnold, the decision to start Irvine almost as a second playmaker, but positioned out wide on the left in Mathew Leckie\u2019s absence, appeared an early masterstroke. An excellent link-man between the lone forward, his combination with Brad Smith marauding from left-back was especially impressive, pinning Jordan back with abandon. So too, the long-awaited return in gold of Tom Rogic appeared heaven sent. In one cameo just before half-time the Celtic playmaker provided three touches in three seconds to remind Australia precisely what they miss when he\u2019s not there. With three opponents looking to pinch the ball, Rogic was first to anticipate and calculate the flight of a looping ball which he brought down superbly. His second touch appeared a prod, away from danger while he used his body to shield the expected challenge, but it was also a disguise. It suggested he was under pressure when he was anything but.

Some would have hoiked the first ball aimlessly forward, others might have thumped it back to the safety of the goalkeeper. But only Rogic had all three touches in his mind as soon as the moment arose. What could have been the start of a lightning counter-attack died at the first touch of his receiving teammate; it was perhaps a portent of what was to come. Jeered off by his own supporters, Jordan\u2019s under-fire Dutch coach Vital Borklemans made an immediate half-time change. An attacking shift as on came the hugely impressive Mousa Suleiman, who immediately looked to besiege at will, twisting and turning with pace and control to instantly trouble the Socceroos defence. It may have taken nearly an hour for Jordan to register a first shot on target, but from there the chances came thick and fast. The dangerous Hamza Al-Dardoor replaced Baha\u2019 Seif at the spear\u2019s head, and Jordan\u2019s third all-time top scorer could and should have added to his tally as the Socceroos backline appeared increasingly negligent.

A real sense of urgency propelled this small passerine, whose southern subspecies has less than 800 individuals left, up to top spot.</p> <p>And in its win, we can see the seeds of the future. Is this the dawn of the highly coordinated, online campaign format \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pat/status/1192649198362955777\">a la New Zealand</a>? For sure, in the washup of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2019/nov/08/bird-of-the-year-2019-tense-wait-finals-spot-round-one-vote-deadline-live\">cassowary round one debacle</a>, the message was clear: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ahcayley/status/1192644125125820417\">Organise early</a>. Tawny frogmouth supporters are now saying the same thing. </p> <p>Elsewhere, we saw a crash in the ibis vote. The magpie is off licking its wounds. The wedge-tailed eagle only just scraped into the top 10 but soared up and up, in a proud performance. It wasn\u2019t to be for the superb fairy-wen, the sulphur-crested cockatoo, the willie wagtail and others, but there\u2019s no shame there. </p> <p>As BirdLife Australia\u2019s <strong>Sean Dooley </strong>said, this was a different kind of win. \u201cThe sad reality is that many of our birds are becoming iconic for all the wrong reasons, they are now emblematic of the extinction crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Now our eyes turn to the future. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/28/may-the-best-bird-win-how-the-2019-voting-system-has-changed\">innovative two-round system</a> added an unpredictable element this year. Who knows what zany ideas our poll organisers have next. And with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2019/nov/11/voter-detected-in-guardians-australian-bird-of-the-year-poll\">attempted voter fraud</a> in both iterations now, I\u2019m excited to see the next battle of wits between these criminals and our data team.</p> <p>What new birds, drama and stories will future bird of the years bring? Nobody knows. </p> <p>Right now, it\u2019s the finch\u2019s moment.

This is pretty typical of runoff elections. Some voters are fatigued by the need to come back to vote again, and others are discouraged by the absence of their favourite.</p> <p>Yet despite the drop in turnout, five of the birds in the final round managed to improve on their first-round total.<br></p> <p>The black-throated finch improved from 13.2% to 34.5%, with more than 11,000 votes. That means more than one in three votes in the final round were cast for the finch, a walloping victory in a 10-horse (10-bird?) race.<br></p> <p>The tawny frogmouth came a clear second with 3,351 votes \u2013 this was just over 10% of votes in the second round, compared with 4.4% in the first round. We can\u2019t really say if the frogmouth benefited from voters switching from birds that had been knocked out, or a bandwagon effect as it became the obvious non-finch option in second place.<br></p> <p>The superb fairy-wren also did well, jumping from sixth to third with 8.9% of the vote.<br></p> <p>I had a theory in 2017 that the magpie and ibis partly did well because they are divisive choices: those who really like them concentrated their votes while those who don\u2019t were scattered, and that a runoff system would disadvantage those birds. This wasn\u2019t wrong, with the magpie dropping from second to fourth and the ibis dropping from fifth to a distant 10th.<br></p> <p>The final round was also a good result for the wedge-tailed eagle, who jumped from 10th to sixth with about 700 more votes than in the first round. It appears that the eagle peaked just at the right time.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-14T21:18:58.105Z\">at 9.18pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dcdc2958f08aab51e1bf564\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-14T21:10:11.324Z\">9.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From ibis fans: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/_slangers/status/1195086254905315328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Not our best turnout, but I remain committed to championing the ibis now and in future.

The reigning champion magpie came in second with 3,569 votes, or 6.5%.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the remaining birds in the top 10 are the typical iconic Australian birds with large populations near most of Australia\u2019s human population: the<strong> kookaburra</strong>, the <strong>sulphur-crested cockatoo</strong>, the <strong>fairy-wren</strong>, the <strong>rainbow lorikeet</strong>, and more left-field choices like the <strong>ibis</strong> and the <strong>tawny frogmouth</strong>.</p> <p>\u201cThe final places in the top 10 came down to the wire with frenetic voting producing a photo finish between the <strong>willie wagtail</strong>, the <strong>wedge-tailed eagle</strong> and the <strong>galah</strong>. The eagle and galah had been trading the 10th place back and forth throughout the vote but both gained ground on the willie wagtail on the final day, and in the end the wagtail maintained its spot in ninth by just two votes, with the eagle holding on against the galah by three votes. The gap between ninth and eleventh was just 0.009%.</p> <p>\u201cA further 2,307 votes were cast for write-in birds, with over 500 of these votes for some type of parrot. Australians really like parrots, and cockatoos in particular, but they don\u2019t seem to be able to fall in line behind one favourite. Eleven parrots (including a number of cockatoo species) were nominated, but Australians had other ideas. Over 200 votes were cast for various types of black cockatoo.

      "bodyText": "And with that, we\u2019ll be wrapping up our live coverage for this morning. The black-throated finch, on debut, has landed with the biggest winning margin in bird of the year history. It\u2019s an important result for the highly endangered bird. A real sense of urgency propelled this small passerine, whose southern subspecies has less than 800 individuals left, up to top spot. And in its win, we can see the seeds of the future. Is this the dawn of the highly coordinated, online campaign format \u2013 a la New Zealand? For sure, in the washup of the cassowary round one debacle, the message was clear: Organise early. Tawny frogmouth supporters are now saying the same thing. Elsewhere, we saw a crash in the ibis vote. The magpie is off licking its wounds. The wedge-tailed eagle only just scraped into the top 10 but soared up and up, in a proud performance. It wasn\u2019t to be for the superb fairy-wen, the sulphur-crested cockatoo, the willie wagtail and others, but there\u2019s no shame there. As BirdLife Australia\u2019s Sean Dooley said, this was a different kind of win. \u201cThe sad reality is that many of our birds are becoming iconic for all the wrong reasons, they are now emblematic of the extinction crisis.\u201d Now our eyes turn to the future. The innovative two-round system added an unpredictable element this year. Who knows what zany ideas our poll organisers have next. And with attempted voter fraud in both iterations now, I\u2019m excited to see the next battle of wits between these criminals and our data team. What new birds, drama and stories will future bird of the years bring? Nobody knows. Right now, it\u2019s the finch\u2019s moment. Until next time. Magpies, the 2017 winners, have staged a walkout after learning this morning\u2019s result. Lorena Allam, Guardian Australia\u2019s Indigenous affairs editor and magpie supporter, captured this image from her home this morning. And here is the statement from one of the key online campaigns that swept the finch to victory: What a well-fledged bunch of numbers that vote is! We know why the finch is so popular and it\u2019s fitting to recognise this beautiful bird in the middle of all-consuming out-of-season bushfires. Right now, the finch\u2019s habitat is being stripped for yet another thermal coalmine as our federal government resists action against climate change impacts. Thank you to all who voted for the black-throated finch. Thank you to the scientists fighting to save the finch\u2019s remaining population. Thank you to the volunteers on the frontlines promoting discussion on the climate emergency in our national and local communities. I\u2019m looking forward to the next bird of the year poll focusing on endangered species. For now, the black-throated finch is a symbol for all of them. It\u2019s time for every voter to activate and demand our leaders give us back our future. Time to save our finch! From the Biodiversity Heritage Library: An interesting question now looms over future bird of the year contests \u2013 is this the start of a new era of political, environmental, or at least highly coordinated winners? Or will we revert next time to a purely avian, less topical choice? Online campaigns are not necessarily a bad thing. In New Zealand, that\u2019s how it has worked for years, with radio stations, publications, huge Facebook pages and even real-life poster squads coalescing around birds every year, with full endorsements and pitched campaigns. I have been wondering how votes would flow from supporters of birds that didn\u2019t make the cut: in particular those who supported other cockatoos. The Carnaby\u2019s black cockatoo and the gang-gang cockatoo came 13th and 14th, but it doesn\u2019t look like their voters swung in behind the sulphur-crested cockatoo, which dropped from fourth to seventh in the final round. Just because one cockatoo is your favourite doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll happily transfer your support to another. The rainbow lorikeet likewise failed to benefit from the votes of a bunch of other parrots which didn\u2019t make the top 10. The lack of general support for cockatoos and parrots makes sense if you assume that a lot of voters choose a bird they see regularly. Voters for Carnaby\u2019s black cockatoo (present in southern Western Australia) were unlikely to switch to vote for an east-coast cockatoo. I have some comment from one of the lead online campaigns for the finch coming soon. The Queensland-based spokesman is just dropping the kids off to school first. Daylight savings means that it was only 5.30am when the result was announced. An early pick for next year\u2019s winner. More than 54,000 votes were cast in the first round of voting, but the second round attracted just 32,000 votes. This is pretty typical of runoff elections. Some voters are fatigued by the need to come back to vote again, and others are discouraged by the absence of their favourite. Yet despite the drop in turnout, five of the birds in the final round managed to improve on their first-round total. The black-throated finch improved from 13.2% to 34.5%, with more than 11,000 votes. That means more than one in three votes in the final round were cast for the finch, a walloping victory in a 10-horse (10-bird?) race. The tawny frogmouth came a clear second with 3,351 votes \u2013 this was just over 10% of votes in the second round, compared with 4.4% in the first round. We can\u2019t really say if the frogmouth benefited from voters switching from birds that had been knocked out, or a bandwagon effect as it became the obvious non-finch option in second place. The superb fairy-wren also did well, jumping from sixth to third with 8.9% of the vote. I had a theory in 2017 that the magpie and ibis partly did well because they are divisive choices: those who really like them concentrated their votes while those who don\u2019t were scattered, and that a runoff system would disadvantage those birds. This wasn\u2019t wrong, with the magpie dropping from second to fourth and the ibis dropping from fifth to a distant 10th. The final round was also a good result for the wedge-tailed eagle, who jumped from 10th to sixth with about 700 more votes than in the first round. It appears that the eagle peaked just at the right time. From ibis fans: Here\u2019s how round one played out. That finch lead basically held for the rest of the competition. I would also like to hear from some magpie voters. Are you happy to pass on the crown? Or will you be challenging the result, hanging on to the faded glory of 2017? Tweet on #birdoftheyear For a while there, the sulphur-crested cockatoo was a frontrunner. It spent long periods at second in the first round, then ended that first leg at fourth. And there were many, many thousands of other cockatoo votes out there that could have swung in behind it. The galah missing out on 10th, many secretly thought, was a huge boon. Yet it actually dropped down to seventh. It\u2019s an intriguing result that reveals something about the psychology of runoff elections. For whatever reason, the sulphur-crested lost its sheen. Analyst Ben Raue does actually have a fascinating explanation for that \u2013 to come soon. \u201cI would argue there are some similarities with last year\u2019s strong result for the ibis. \u201cThe ibis is not an endangered bird, and it wasn\u2019t successful due to a political campaign, but it does draw support from people who like it, sometimes in spite of its reputation as an unappealing bird. It\u2019s the underdog, hated by many but liked by those who understand where it has come from. It\u2019s exactly the kind of story that can draw votes one year but not do so well the next year.\u201d And now some psephological analysis: \u201cThe finch\u2019s success shows the power of a campaign, and giving people a reason to vote. \u201cA lot of people would have voted for their personal favourite bird, but others would have seen the finch as an opportunity to make a point and elevate an endangered but obscure bird to a position among the more famous of our birds. While the finch fell well short of a majority in both rounds, it gained much more concentrated support than other birds who would have mostly attracted votes as the personal favourite bird of some Australians. \u201cIt has a parallel with the New Zealand poll, which recently crowned the yellow-eyed penguin or hoiho as champion. The hoiho is the rarest penguin in the world, with only 225 pairs on the New Zealand mainland, but it managed to attract over 12,000 votes. \u201cThe victories for the finch and hoiho demonstrate that this vote isn\u2019t just about who your \u2018favourite bird\u2019 is. People can have multiple favourites and can decide how to vote based on other factors \u2013 what bird is endangered, or who has a chance of winning. A bandwagon can be attractive.\u201d Those final standings: Black-throated finch \u2013 11,153 Tawny frogmouth \u2013 3,351 Superb fairy-wren \u2013 2,875 Australian magpie \u2013 2,725 Laughing kookaburra \u2013 2,650 Wedge-tailed eagle \u2013 2,402 Sulphur-crested cockatoo \u2013 2,341 Willie wagtail \u2013 1,970 Rainbow lorikeet \u2013 1,711 Australian white ibis \u2013 1,147 Total valid* final round votes \u2013 32,325 Total valid* first round votes \u2013 54,515 *We excluded a lot of you sneaky double voters. Just opening the browser again in incognito mode is not enough. There are beautiful illustrations here. As Sean Dooley told us earlier: \u201cThey are subtly stunning ... They are a literal breath-taker when you see them.\u201d Oh the ibis. What happened. I would say this is a huge fall from grace, but we all know the ibis was never anywhere near grace anyway. This is rather a plummet: from the top of the bin to the soggy bottom. The controversial scavenger came second in 2017, with 19,083 votes! Now it has limped to 10th, and only 1,147. Not only is that nearly 18,000 less than 2017, it\u2019s actually down on its round-one vote from last week. With every passing day, more desert the ibis. A lot of joy right now in the frogmouth camp, who it seems, did not expect to reach as high as second. It\u2019s a pure and uncynical emotion, gracious to the winner, but full of pride for what they have themselves achieved. \u201cA superb result for #teamtawnyfrogmouth,\u201d says one, \u201cgiven that the winner is essentially a protest vote.\u201d And of course, there are plenty now planning a bigger campaign next time. Is she disappointed that we are yet to see a nocturnal bird win? \u201cI understand the urgency in electing the black-throated finch,\u201d Gorman says. \u201cThe tawny frogmouth isn\u2019t the bird Australia needed today, but I hope in the future, we\u2019ll be in a good enough place to move beyond our relentless diurnalism to see the value and inspirational potential in creatures of the night.\u201d Alyx Gorman, Guardian Australia\u2019s lifestyle editor and self-appointed tawny frogmouth campaign head, had this to say: \u201cTawny\u2019s near-victory showcases Australia\u2019s creative promise. I hope next year the moon will rise again for this sweet, semi-urban nightjar. \u201cA living Pok\u00e9mon with the eyes of a baby and the whiskers of a grandpa may not be the bird we need today, but it speaks of a future where ravers, boomers and \u2018oom\u2019-chanting yogis can peaceful coexist in a single animal.\u201d Spare a thought for the tawny frogmouth. This unique, bewitching bird could have been the first nocturnal winner of bird of the year. But that milestone wasn\u2019t to be. Fourth in 2017, and seventh in round one, the frogmouth came like a bolt from the blue, overhauling the magpie and the similar-looking kookaburra to be best of the rest. I have approached one of the leaders of the frogmouth campaign for comment, and their concession speech should be with us shortly. That is, in anyone\u2019s eyes, a landslide for the black-throated finch. Stay with us as we mop up all the reaction \u2013 the glory, the tragedy, the concessions, and the inquests. \u201cBirds express what\u2019s going on in the landscape,\u201d Dooley says. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happened with the fires. That\u2019s millions of birds in New South Wales that have died in the fires and have lost their habitat. \u201cBirds sing the landscape, they express it. And so it\u2019s no surprise that the black-throated finch has caught people\u2019s attention. And, unfortunately, these days, Australians are switching on to the fact that these unique birds we have are starting to disappear. And sot hat\u2019s why the black-throated finch has attracted this attention.\u201d \u201cProbably most Australians didn\u2019t know about this bird a couple of years ago,\u201d Dooley tells ABC Breakfast. \u201cUnfortunately, this bird, even though it is lovely, it\u2019s mainly known because it\u2019s in such peril. \u201cThe southern black-throated finch unfortunately happens to have its last main habitat, last remaining population of any considerable size, is actually at ground zero for the Adani coalmine.\u201d The most endangered bird on the top 10 list, the black-throated finch, has been voted the 2019 Guardian/BirdLife Australia bird of the year. And it\u2019s a landslide. With more than 30,000 valid votes cast, the finch won with a tremendous 11,153. The tawny frogmouth came a distant second, with 3,351. The finch held an early lead for much of the poll and not only held on, but increased its lead in the final round. But it was still an amazing showing for the frogmouth, who came only seventh in round one, but then charged ahead to second when it mattered. A disappointing result for the magpie \u2013 who won in 2017 and was second after round one \u2013 slumping to fourth. Our full report is here: The superb fairy-wren has come third. And the tawny frogmouth is second. Which means ... The kookaburra is fifth, and the magpie is fourth! A slump for the magpie, who won last time in 2017. The winner will be revealed in minutes! Sean Dooley is on ABC Breakfast right now, about to make the announcement. Those top 10 of course, were winnowed down from an initial 50. A lot of beloved, big-name birds did not make it through. The preference flows from those excluded birds could decide today. There are tens of thousands of votes looking for a home. It\u2019s enough to overhaul any frontrunner. The sulphur-crested cockatoo, you\u2019d think, would soak up the galah\u2019s 1,705 votes, the Carnaby\u2019s black-cockatoo (1,271), the gang-gang cockatoo (1163), the palm cockatoo (328) and at a stretch, the eastern rosella (642). And whither the cassowary? The hugely popular and deadly bird surged hundreds of votes at the last, but didn\u2019t make it. Perhaps the eagle? The ibis? Predicting this is often a fool\u2019s game. Momentum is a big factor, and the eagle benefited from the push to secure 10th. And let\u2019s not forget, a lot of people simply shift their vote in round tw0. The cockatoo could lose its sheen, the superb fairy-wren might look merely OK, after a few days. Ben Raue is on hand to provide some psephological analysis of the first round of voting: \u201cOver 54,000 votes were cast in the first round, with the black-throated finch, a bird threatened by the proposed Adani coalmine, way out in front with 7,234 votes, over 13% of the total vote. The reigning champion magpie came in second with 3,569 votes, or 6.5%. \u201cMost of the remaining birds in the top 10 are the typical iconic Australian birds with large populations near most of Australia\u2019s human population: the kookaburra, the sulphur-crested cockatoo, the fairy-wren, the rainbow lorikeet, and more left-field choices like the ibis and the tawny frogmouth. \u201cThe final places in the top 10 came down to the wire with frenetic voting producing a photo finish between the willie wagtail, the wedge-tailed eagle and the galah. The eagle and galah had been trading the 10th place back and forth throughout the vote but both gained ground on the willie wagtail on the final day, and in the end the wagtail maintained its spot in ninth by just two votes, with the eagle holding on against the galah by three votes. The gap between ninth and eleventh was just 0.009%. \u201cA further 2,307 votes were cast for write-in birds, with over 500 of these votes for some type of parrot. Australians really like parrots, and cockatoos in particular, but they don\u2019t seem to be able to fall in line behind one favourite. Eleven parrots (including a number of cockatoo species) were nominated, but Australians had other ideas. Over 200 votes were cast for various types of black cockatoo. This was in addition to the Carnaby\u2019s black cockatoo, who came 13th. \u201cThe cockatiel and crimson rosella also polled well. But by far the leading write-in candidate was the king parrot, who polled 180 candidates, more than two of the officially nominated birds. Keep an eye out for a king parrot on the ballot next time around.\u201d Who are the contenders? Under a new two-round voting system, implemented this year to make the process fairer and more reflective of voter intention, there are 10 birds today snatching at the crown. They are, in order of how they finished at the end of round one: Black-throated finch Australian magpie Laughing kookaburra Sulphur-crested cockatoo Australian white ibis Superb fairy-wren Tawny frogmouth Rainbow lorikeet Willie wagtail Wedge-tailed eagle But, as the last-minute drama of the end of round one showed us, anything can happen in bird of the year. Those rankings are not set in stone. So here we are. Three weeks, two rounds, 50 birds, then 10, and in a few minutes, one \u2013 flying lazily through the sky, medal-in-beak. Voting closed last night and, in the moments before the curtain rises, it is all up for grabs. The magpie has 2017\u2019s shiny sash in its nest and is looking around jealously. The poll has been dark for days. For 48 hours, the country\u2019s finest statisticians have been building models, trend lines, big corkboards with red string with birds perched on them. We\u2019ve had thrills, spills and scandals. There are 10 birds that could win today, each with their own unique strengths, personalities, regional power bases and, of course, their supporters, squawking in their corners. The highly endangered black-throated finch was the first round\u2019s breakout star. The magpie won in 2017 with nearly 20,000 votes. The ibis came second, barely a wingflap behind. The kookaburra came third, both this year in round one and in 2017 \u2013 surely a sign of some lasting community support. The frogmouth could be the first nocturnal bird to win, one for the history books. The sulphur-crested cockatoo could mop up the preferences of all its parrot comrades (the galah, Carnaby\u2019s black cockatoo, gang-gang cockatoo and more). The last time we did this, just one week ago, there were incredible scenes. The electoral commission went into overdrive, the result too close to call, as we scratched in the depths through the write-in votes. And that was just the warm-up. The winner for the whole thing will be announced after 6.30am AEDT. Stay tuned.",

The inspector general\u2019s report, which strongly criticised Brian Hook, who has led the US campaign to isolate Iran, is one of a series of scandals at the state department contributing to a growing crisis of confidence among the country\u2019s diplomats. On Tuesday, NBC News revealed that the official in charge of conflict and stability operations, had fabricated much of her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, inventing a role on a UN panel, and falsely implied she had Harvard and Army War College degrees. The official, Mina Chang, even faked a Time magazine cover about herself, but she was put in a post with a $6m budget and which normally requires a top-secret security clearance. The new report also comes in a week in which US diplomats have appeared as key witnesses at congressional impeachment hearings, which has led to their professionalism and integrity being impugned by the president and his supporters, while the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has said nothing to defend them. In his report, details of which were first reported by Politico, the state department\u2019s inspector general, Steve Linick, published correspondence and testimony between Hook and other political appointees on removing Sahar Nowrouzzadeh, a civil servant of Iranian descent, from the high-profile policy planning office run by Hook. Top aides to the then secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, circulated a rightwing magazine story that portrayed Nowrouzzadeh as a diehard Obama loyalist who was obstructing the new administration\u2019s policies. One of those officials, Julia Haller, who was acting White House liaison officer, noted in an email that Nowrouzzadeh \u201cwas born in Iran and upon my understanding cried when the president won\u201d and argued it would be easy to get her suspended.

Haller\u2019s comments were part of an email chain which was forwarded to Hook, who noted, \u201cThis initial info is helpful\u201d and added: \u201cI\u2019ve emailed friends who tracked the Iran deal for intel on her and waiting to hear back.\u201d Nowrouzzadeh was moved out of the policy planning office before her assignment was completed and has since left the state department. In her first public comment on the case, she said on Twitter: \u201cIt is my hope that the inspector general\u2019s findings pertaining to my case help prompt action that will guard against any further such misconduct by members of this or any future administration.\u201d When questioned for the report, Hook, claimed that he had agreed to remove her because he had a replacement in mind, but the inspector general found that to be false. The eventually replacement was not in contact with Hook until after Nowrouzzadeh had been moved and did not start until some months later.

The report did not find wrongdoing in four other cases it looked into, but in part this was because senior figures would not talk to the inspector general\u2019s staff. Ian Moss, a former marine and a state department lawyer who worked in the White House and the office set up by the Obama administration, was assigned in September 2017 to working alongside unpaid interns doing data entry for freedom of information requests.

      "bodyText": "Here is Tumaini Carayol\u2019s report ... Right then, that\u2019s about us. Thanks all for your company, and join us over the weekend for the staggering denouement. Ta-ra. \u201cWHAT A PERFORMANCE FROM THE GREATEST! WHAT A PHENOMENAL HUMAN BEING! WE ARE PRIVILEGED TO BE LIVING HIS TIME!\u201d emails Liam Grigg. Phew, for a minute there, I lost myself. Already, this has been such a fun tournament, and I\u2019ve not the remotest who\u2019s going to win it. You can make a case for almost all of those still in with a chance, but if Federer serves as he did today, I\u2019d say Nadal remains the only man able to beat him. We learn that Pete Sampras\u2019 six year-end number 1 ratings - the only record he still owns - remains intact. \u201cRoger is Roger, but at the same time Novak is Novak,\u201d says Daniella Hantuchova with tautology that would grace the Wire. She, and Rusedski, feel that the crowd should show the latter more respect. Annabel Croft says she feels sorry for Djokovic, whose double faults were being cheered by the crowd. He is human and he needs to be loved, basically. England have qualified for the Euros, beating Montenegro 7-0; Harry Kane helped himself to a first-half hat-trick. Check it out here: Federer won 81% of points on his first serve. That is not bad, and the cornerstone of a performance that was pretty much perfect. It\u2019s fair to say that Djokovic was off, but he was knocked off right from the start. Federer says it\u2019s incredibly special. \u201cI enjoyed it,\u201d he deadpans. \u201cMagical, you guys are super-special, I can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d What did he do different today, that he didn\u2019t do at Wimbledon? \u201cI won the matchpoint,\u201d he joshes. He says it was an honour to play that final though, and that he played a great tournament to beat Nishikori and Nadal. He then says it\u2019s hard to play your best in the groups and compliments Thiem. \u201cIt was a great performance tonight from me,\u201d he says, the kind of line that sounds ludicrous from almost anyone but him. He\u2019s looking forward to the weekend, enjoying the city and the food - the food in London? Do me a lemon - and that\u2019s about it from him. *Djokovic 4-6 3-6 Federer Federer races to 0-30, and then when he balloons a forehand, so does Djokovic, only super-long! And what a return Federer produces, backhand, down to the ankles as Djokovic comes in! WHAT A PERFORMANCE FROM THE GREATEST! WHAT A PHENOMENAL HUMAN BEING! WE ARE PRIVILEGED TO BE LIVING HIS TIME! _______________ I AM SPEECHLESS! Djokovic 4-6 3-5 Federer* \u201cSuper uncomfortable evening for Djokovic\u201d we\u2019re told; when did \u201csuper\u201d replace \u201cvery\u201d as an intensifier? Recently someone described someone else to me as \u201csuper not academic\u201d, unaware of the hypocrisy such phrasing revealed. Anyway, Federer is super not playing badly, and it\u2019s 5-3 in a trice. Djokovic will serve to stay in the tournament, and to save his chances of finishing the year as world number 1. *Djokovic 4-6 3-4 Federer A careless backhand from Djokovic - what a sentence that it to type - hands Federer 15-all. But it\u2019s quickly 30-15, and a luscious drop raises game point, quickly taken. Djokovic 4-6 2-4 Federer* Federer is just not donating Djokovic a sniff. But then at 40-15, a couple of loopy forehands off not the middle allow a winner ... so Federer finds yet another first serve-forehand combo move, and he\u2019s two games away. \u201cPeople have been suggesting that Federer might be past it for years,\u201d says Matt Dony, \u201cand he just keeps laughing and hitting beautiful shots. The man is two weeks older than me, and I\u2019m pretty certain I\u2019ve been past it since about 2003. I\u2019d say he\u2019s a machine, but he\u2019s just too darn elegant and creative to be reduced to mechanical metaphors. (And I\u2019m starting to think I might have left it a bit late for a tilt at Wimbledon.)\u201d I feel you. I\u2019m ages, more or less, with Rio Ferdinand, and I remember saying he was past it then remembering that I was at my unchanging peak. My knee hurts when I sit at my desk for too long, but otherwise I\u2019m absolutely good to go. *Djokovic 4-6 2-3 Federer Federer is winning almost all the short points and Djokovic is winning most of the long ones, but currently there are way more of the former. And all of a sudden, just as Djokovic was scratching his way into the match, Federer has 0-40! Djokovic saves the first break point with a backhand winner, but then goes long with a forehand and this is nearly over! The way Federer is serving and the way Djokovic is returning, not a chance he breaks back ... except this is Novak Djokovic we\u2019re talking about and he can do anything. Djokovic 4-6 2-2 Federer* And he we go, Djokovic finding his way to 0-15 ... a situation that Federer quickly resolves. On average, points on his service are lasting two shots. Absolute joker. Then at 15-30, Djokovic goes long with a return - that\u2019s a missed opportunity, but evidence Federer is cooling slightly - and a forehand into the corner gives him a first break point of the match! Naturally, Federer thunders down a serve that looks like an ace, but Djokovic challenges and it\u2019s wide, by a breath - but it\u2019s extremely whatever because Federer then cleans up. *Djokovic 4-6 2-1 Federer Just when it looks like Djokovic is breezing through a much-needed easy hold, Federer flips a backhand past him for 40-30. But Djokovic strong stands, to win the next point; he\u2019ll know that he\u2019s hanging in there now, especially with that elbow situation - it\u2019s giving him gyp - but if he can hold his serve, he\u2019ll fancy a point here or there when he needs it most. Djokovic 4-6 1-1 Federer* We see a map of Federer\u2019s serves and it\u2019s ridiculous, so many of them on the lines. Meanwhile, after a murderous forehand gives him 15-0, Djokovic clutches his elbow, but takes succour from ... are you sitting down ... a Federer double fault! I know! But he responds with a lovely wrongfooting forehand, cross-court from the backhand corner ... but they wind up at deuce. What price that hold in the previous game now! Er, 0p. Federer quickly closes out. *Djokovic 4-6 1-0 Federer Djokovic just could not get going in that first set. Federer put him under right from the start and played beautifully all the way through, but it\u2019s the quality of serving that must\u2019ve been most dispiriting for his opponent. And here we go again, Federer nailing a second serve down the line at 15-0 before earning 15-30 ... and a forehand into the bootlaces forces Djokovic to net! Two break points, and might this be that? A wild forehand from Federer saves the first, and then a nondescript approach allows Djokovic to go cross-court. But at advantage, Djokovic makes another uncharacteristic error, before a pause for a clown wearing a bobble hat indoors to put his camera away. Djokovic cleans up thereafter, and I wonder if we\u2019ll look back at that as the key hold of the match. Djokovic 4-6 Federer* Off we go. A service winner gives Federer 15-0 and a forehand, whipped cross-court, confirms Federer\u2019s status as the foremost geometrist of the age. Another booming serve follows \u2013 this is poetry \u2013 and an ace wraps it up. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SERVE BETTER THAN THIS, AGAINST THE GREATEST RETURNER IN THE GAME! *Djokovic 4-5 Federer Federer is a joke. A big forehand gets him 0-15 and then a wild one from Djokovic puts him two points away from the set; he\u2019s seeing it, and even if Djokovic hauls him back, he\u2019ll know that a break just is not on the agenda the way they\u2019re both playing. He does haul him back - Federer plays an ill-advised drop not for the first time, a tactic he should drop because Djokovic is doing well at the net \u2013 and two points later, the game is did. After a quick relax, Federer will serve for this first set. Djokovic 3-5 Federer* Djokovic has done nothing on the Federer serve yet so far, and he can\u2019t do anything here either, an ace down the middle making it 40-0. This is really brilliant from yerman, another pearler of a second, out wide again, too good for yerotherman, who\u2019ll now serve to stay in the set. *Djokovic 3-4 Federer A fine forehand return from Federer gives him 30-15, and then another forehand, somehow down the line but hit from the middle of the court, gives him a sniff. He then comes in following a second serve - Djokovic has been so good in that department lately, but it\u2019s not working for him tonight - but a pass sets up game point, and a big first one clinches it. Djokovic 2-4 Federer* Federer gets to 30-0 making it 12 out of 13 first serves made, and an ace makes it 40-0. Not bad. And have a look! A second serve, Edberg-style, kicking onto the sideline for an ace! I say! *Djokovic 2-3 Federer Djokovic needed that. He ends up holding to 30, but that was a much more authoritative game for him, and finished with him having the better of a net confrontation. Djokovic 1-3 Federer* I do feel like we\u2019ve seen this before: Federer starts well but can\u2019t sustain his level, especially with Djokovic wearing him down. And here we go, Djokovic crashing a forehand winner cross-court to open the game. Then, at 15-all, he runs down a drop to spirit a winner cross-court, but Federer is having none of him and resolves the game from there. *Djokovic 1-2 Federer Djokovic begins with a double, then sends down another fault immediately afterwards ... and another! That second one, down the middle, missed by an aeon! Federer then makes himself a chance with a backhand slice, which he nails with a forehand down the line! The best rally of the match follows, Djokovic dictating, but then Federer finds a backhand down the line! These two are so so good, and watching them play is ridiculously moving. Djokovic 1-1 Federer* That was a decent start for Federer; or, alternatively, that was his chance and he missed it. We shall see. We\u2019ve started seeing. Federer rushes through the game to 15, and that was something of a statement. *Djokovic 1-0 Federer Djokovic serves to Federer\u2019s forehand and the return - a free one really - goes wide. We get a rally next though, and it\u2019s even until Djokovic swipes a backhand cross-court \u2013 his consistency is something else. But he then comes in and isn\u2019t definitive enough with his volley before making it 40-15 and serving a double; now then. Federer comes in himself and Djokovic can\u2019t pass, then Djokovic goes long with an awkward forehand off the baseline; deuce. But from there he quickly serves out. \u201cThere have been 66 majors since and including Wimbledon 2003,\u201d tweets Brand King. \u201cOf those 66, Fed, Rafa and Novak account for 55 titles, with only seven other players breaking through. That\u2019s 8448 entries into the main draw &amp; only ten different champions. The elite breathe rarefied air.\u201d I\u2019m not sure sport has seen anything like it, never mind tennis. Djokovic to serve, and ... PLAY. Djokovic eyedrops himself. It\u2019s nearly time. Harry Kane has put England 2-0 up. They need a point to seal qualification for the Euros. The O2 is terrible for music \u2013 Leonard Cohen aside \u2013 but it\u2019s absolutely great for tennis. And actually, it\u2019s especially good in the nosebleeds, where you get a much better idea of how hard the players hit the ball and when they really open their shoulders to put a bit more in. Here they come! Goran Ivanisevic says that Djokovic is feeling good, and that Federer will be thinking about the matchpoints he missed. Djokovic needs to be more attacking than he was against Thiem. He\u2019s told that the court is quick, and asked who that favours \u2013 Federer, basically \u2013 but he says it\u2019s the court, the balls are just flying about and hard to control. Elsewhere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has put England ahead against Montenegro. You can follow that with Paul Doyle. Djokovic needs to win here to end the year as world number 1. I\u2019m sure he fancies that, but I\u2019d be astonished if it inspired nerves so intense they hindered his performance tonight. In the box, they can\u2019t see a way for Federer. I wouldn\u2019t quite go that far \u2013 if he can work his approaches, get to the net, and put Djokovic under, he\u2019s got a chance. But that\u2019s about the size of it. Rusedski points out that Thiem hit 51 winners to beat Djokovic, otherwise known as the Stan method. I guess it tells us that he still doesn\u2019t think he can outplay Djokovic, so he went for broke and hit the seam. It\u2019s hard to pull that off more than once in a year, never mind more than once in a tournament. I think I\u2019ve just talked myself into backing Djokovic to lift the trophy on Sunday. Breaking: Tim has informed us that the winner is into the semis and the loser is going home. More news as I get it. Obviously it\u2019s Henman, Rusedski and Croft in the studio. What imagination! Marat Safin is on the telly. I\u2019m told that he was as brilliant as going out as he was at playing tennis, which is the reason he \u201conly\u201d won one major. Even thinking about this has put me in a fair old spin. How can we make sense of the world? On this topic, Tumaini Carayol, now of this kehila parish, has some thoughts on the subject. I know that comparison is the death of beauty and all that, but how are we ranking them? I\u2019d go Federer first I suppose, but is that an aesthetic call? Did Nadal have his number when both were at their best? is Djokovic less beatable when facing another top player playing well? I say all of this, but really, what am I chatting about? Anyone who can conceive of anything without Federer, Nadal and Djokovic is a fabulist. Ooonnnnn the other hand, Thiem has since been beaten by Berretini, Zverev then lost to Tsitsipas, and Nadal did eventually get by Medvedev. But it\u2019s a start, because the issue isn\u2019t yet one of consistency, rather ability: they have to beat the best before they can beat the best repeatedly. Of course, none of it will really mean anything until someone wins a Slam \u2013 now that you ask, I think Medvedev and Tsitsipas will, Thiem will in Paris if Nadal quits while he\u2019s still good and fit, and Zverev won\u2019t because his volleying and reliability will never quite get there. I might be wrong. Well! Is the playing field finally level? These two meet tonight having both lost to Dominic Thiem, while Rafael Nadal was beaten by Alex Zverev then only just sneaked by Daniil Medvedev. It\u2019s taken years and skipped a generation \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the false dawns of your Griggsys, your Nickys, your Miloses and the rest \u2013 but finally, aged 127, 109 and 106 respectively, the big three are losing big matches to children. Quite how tennis copes with that, I\u2019ve not a clue \u2013 for a decade, it was the best sport in the world in terms of how good its greatest were, and it\u2019s inconceivable that these will be anywhere near them \u2013 but we\u2019re good for a change, and it looks like we\u2019re getting one. Whoever wins tonight will join Thiem and Stefanos Tsitsipas in the semi-finals, with Nadal, Zverev and Medvedev fighting over the final sport tomorrow. I\u2019d be buzzing for that if I wasn\u2019t replete with buzz for this \u2013 we don\u2019t know how much more of these boys we\u2019ve got, so it\u2019s our duty as human beings to wade right into them while we can.

We have a young England team who look like they enjoy playing the game and currently (I think) have a goal difference of plus 26. Plus a manager who trusts in youth and gives them the space to play.

      "bodyText": "Sterling defends Gomez ... Ed Aarons runs the rule over the players ... This is what happened in the rest of Europe ... Barney Ronay on Kane ... Here comes David Hytner\u2019s report from Wembley. What pleased Gareth Southgate most? \u201cThe attacking playing in the first half, in particular,\u201d replies the England manager. Really good movement and super quality of passing and crossing, and really good finishing. We know we should win the group but you look around Europe and there are other countries who struggle to sore the goals that we have. [But] we have to get both ends of the pitch right. We conceded a couple of chances tonight that we shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Oxlade-Chamberlain: \u201cIt was nice to be back in the starting lineup, it\u2019s been a while. I just wanted to concentrate on doing the things that the manager and Steve had been talking about this week. Specifically I was in the No8 role ... so attacking and defending ... I\u2019ve been in good form with the goals recently so when the chance came up, I felt confident. [This team] is young and exciting and they work hard too.\u201d Kane\u2019s verdict: \u201cWe had one slip-up in the whole group and responded really well. We got the job done here today. Of course we were expected to win the group but it\u2019s never easy. There are a lot of upsets in football.\u201d Kane also reveals that he had a role in the decision to exclude Raheem Sterling (so expect him to be booed at Wembley next time, yeah?): \u201cThe gaffer spoke to me and a few of the other senior players in the team and that\u2019s the decision we came too.\u201d England stroll into Euro 2020. The 1000th match in their history was among the easiest they\u2019ve played. But even allowing for the ramshackle nature of the opposition, England deserve praise for the way they attacked today. Rashford and Chilwell stood out; Oxlade-Chamberlain was very good, too. Questions remain about their defence but they won\u2019t be answered until England come up against tougher adversaries - which they will do next summer. 90 min: In this group\u2019s other game, Czech Republic are leading Kosovo 2-1. If that scores stays the same, then Kosovo, who play England next, will not be able to finish in the top two of the group. 89 min: Maddison tries to sneak a pass through to Sancho buts gets his calculations just wrong. \u201cI am not a fan of pre-qualifiers for smaller nations,\u201d declares Paddy Schwind. \u201cIt would mean half of them have exactly one competition match every two years (two with home and away).These countries are sovereign nations, proper UEFA members and have a right to play just as all others.We know what the CL looks like today. Where are the champions from the smaller nations? Teams that actually won the whole thing in the past. They are excluded from the CL and are pushed further to the margins every year. If you want less games and more rest for your players, there are an abundance of ways to reach that. Eighteen teams in the PL, less teams in the CL, scrap the nations league and other crappy tournaments. Excluding smaller nations should not be considered.\u201d What\u2019s more, size isn\u2019t everything. Compare and contrast the histories of England and Uruguay, for instance. Abraham claims his first senior international goal! Chilwell slipped in Sancho wide on the left. The winger plays a careful low pass towards the near post, where Abraham, having made sure he got to it before the defender, slides it into the net. Nice one. 82 min: A corner is cleared as far as Alexander-Arnold about 25 yards out. Which mean it isn\u2019t cleared at all. The fullbacks lets fly with a swirler. But it doesn\u2019t make it through the copse of bodies in front of him. \u201cOn the one hand, I can understand why people ask what value there is in qualifiers like this any more,\u201d begins Phil Sawyer. \u201cBut those people have short memories. There was a time when, even faced with a group like this, England would have laboured to a few unconvincing wins, including probably a couple of drawn stinkers at home, while the midfield passed the ball in straight lines across the pitch and the front two ran around like headless chickens. We have a young England team who look like they enjoy playing the game and currently (I think) have a goal difference of plus 26. Plus a manager who trusts in youth and gives them the space to play. Just remember, the last match before Southgate took charge was a drab affair where Allardyce said \u2018Wayne Rooney can play where he wants\u2019 and nothing much happened. We should be enjoying this. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d 81 min: Maddison corner arcs out of play before reaching the near post. 79 min: With little afoot on the pitch, the crowd are amusing themselves with Mexican waves. After booing Gomez. 75 min: Abraham has put himself about gamely since coming on but his eagerness is at the cost of a sure touch. Mind you, it\u2019s not an especially easy for him given that many of his teammates have dialled down their endeavour now. Montenegro substitution: Boljevic on Haksabanovic off. \u201cI think the sixth goal was a bit jammy,\u201d protests Josse Mcmahon. \u201cVar would have disallowed it for the touch on Sancho\u2019s arm in the buildup.\u201d Nonsense. It is perfectly clear and obvious by now that no one can say with any certainty what Var would and would not allow. England substitution: Gomez on, Mount off. Unless Im mis-hearing, there were plenty of boos for Gomez. Wembley is where Sterling\u2019s grew up, of course. 69 min: England pop the ball about just outside the opposing area. Mount and Abraham look particularly eager to force another breakthrough. But Montenegro have tightened up defensively. A little. A ridiculous goal! Rashford did brilliantly, cutting through the defence on the left and then pingingin a mid-height cross. The keeper got a little touch, Sancho headed backwards from cose range, Mount shanked the follow-up... and the defender drove into his own goal via the underside of the bar from five yards! Montenegro substitution: Jankovic on, Jovovic off 63 min: Mount, who has not really impressed today, passes to the referee. 61 min: Chilwell floats over another corner, giving it enough air for Maguire to wind up a long run and leap. But the centreback can\u2019t keep his header down. 59 min: \u201cOn one hand, I\u2019m a big fan of international football, and I get fed up with the \u2018This isn\u2019t proper football, only the almighty Premier League matters\u2019 brigade,\u201d lectures Matt Dony. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassingly excited to have Ramsey back for Wales, and there are interesting stories happening all over the Euro qualification matches. International football matters. I also believe that smaller nations will only improve with constant exposure to high-level football, and occasional thrashings are a price they have to pay, if only to calibrate the kind of improvement they need to make. In principle, I think it\u2019s the right thing for England to do to keep their foot on the throttle and fill their boots. But, at the same time, apart from Kane, are there really many people enjoying this as a spectacle?\u201d Going for more goals surely makes for better viewing than winding down. Or are you suggesting the match should be stopped once victory is secured? I dare say Montenegro don\u2019t agree: they\u2019re making a better first of this second period - 0-0 in this period so far - so they\u2019re evidently taking this as an opportunity to prove they\u2019re fast learners. England substitutions: Maddison and Abraham on, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Kane off. 56 min: No goal! Mount prodded into the net from close range after Kane\u2019s shot from a cross by Alexander-Arnold was saved. But Mount was fractionally offside. 54 min: Southgate has ordered Abraham and Maddison to get stripped. If it\u2019s England\u2019s soft start to the second period that has riled him, good for him. 53 min: A foxy pice of shoulder control by Rashford, receiving a long diagonal pass and shunting the ball past his man with a single sly roll. He would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren\u2019t for a pesky defender. 51 min: A lull. I do hope England haven\u2019t decided to go easy on their opponents. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t \u2018mean and excessive and bad sportsmanship\u2019 for USA to beat Thailand 13-0,\u201d quibbles Jeremy Solomon. \u201cIt was their over the top goal celebrations even for the last few goals that was so obnoxious. Scoring lots of goals is fine, and in fact valuable occasionally if goal difference is important. But I think you need to have some perspective when it comes to on-field celebrations.\u201d Which is exactly the point that Neville Southall famously made to Michael Owen ... 47 min: Rashford zooms forward on another impressive run before being fouled. \u201cHarry Kane presenting Match of The Day?\u201d gaps Brett Milligan. \u201cWith a chin like that? Can\u2019t see that ever happening...\u201d Ah, dear old Jimmy Hill. 46 min: Off we go again. Just 45 more minutes for Montenegro to endure. \u201cRegarding Mr. Mark Witty: are Montenegro playing professionals?\u201d asks Alex Amponsah. \u201cIf so open up a 12-pack, fill your boots and thrash away.\u201d Hear, hear! It\u2019ll do Montenegro good in the long run. \u201cFor years watching England we would get to the 18 yard box and go nowhere,\u201d says Roger Kirkby. \u201cI\u2019ll take a poacher like Harry Kane any day of the week.\u201d Absolutely. Keep it up and he\u2019ll find himself hosting Match of the Day before long. \u201cI had a discussion with a US friend of mine regarding the US Women\u00b4s rout of Thailand at the last WC,\u201d reveals Mark Witty. \u201cI think it was 14-0 . I thought it was mean and excessive and bad sportsmanship. There might you be one day at the end of that humiliation. I hope England do not score 10. Send on the 19-year-olds, mess with the Formation. Take the foot off the gas?\u201d Nonsense. The opposition must be crushed whenever possible. Sure, there\u2019s scope for a bit of experimentation in the second half but not for pity. Besides, USA only beat Thailand 13-0. The referee decided to add precisely no additional time, so England have to settle for a five-goal lead at the break. They could double that, at least, in the second half. They have attacked well: fast, imaginative and elusive, albeit against dreadful opponents. Chilwell, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Rashford have been especially good, and Kane has poached well (but should have had his hat0trick even earlier). The only downsides have been a couple of bits of slack defending, where Pickford had to bail out his central defenders. 42 min: More thrilling work by Rashford, swapping passes with Oxlade-Chamberlain as he make a jagged run infield from the left. His long-range shot takes a nick off a defender and flies wide. 40 min: A lapse in the English defence allows Beqiraj to run on to a pass from deep and straight through on goal. Pickford has to make a good save to preserve England\u2019s clean sheet for the second time in this half. Their defence remains a concern. Having said that, France are currently drawing 1-1 at home to Moldova so, you know. \u201cAs a non-English fan of England I have a question,\u201d announces Matthew Carpenter-Arevalo. \u201cAre all backheels \u2018cheeky?\u2019\u201d Not quite: some are \u201cimpudent\u201d and I recall at least one \u201cmulish\u201d one by Frank Stapleton. There\u2019s his hat-trick. He can thank Alexander-Arnold for a nice cross and Montenegro\u2019s defence for being rubbish. But his first touch was deft and his second deadly, firing home from seven yards. 33 min: With their defensive rigour long gone, Montenegro are now losing their temper. Vesovic kicks at Rashford as the player shields the ball from him and then, when Rashford complains, he square up to the Man United player and presses his forehead against his. The ref books him, and possibly the entirely innocent Rashford too (his card waving was not clear). England take the corner short. Oxlade-Chamberlain sends in a cross from deep. Montenegro\u2019s defence melts away again and Maguire is left with a free header at the back post. The keeper saves well but the ball comes to Rashford, who eliminates a defender with a subtle touch and then curls the ball low into the far corner. We want 10, we want 10! 29 min: Alexander-Arnold sees Sancho peeling away into space on the right and duly deposits the ball into his path. Montenegro scramble to concede a corner. 27 min: Haksabanovic does indeed provide a good delivery, which apparently takes Stones by surprise, as the Man City defender allows Simic to get the run on him and aim a fine header towards goal from 10 yards. Pickford has much better reactions, pawing the ball away superbly! 26 min: Chilwell has to turn to defensive duties now to stop a run by Vesovic. He catches him on the foot, conceding a freekick in a useful crossing position. IS there a Montenegrin Chilwell to take the setpiece? Another assist from Chilwell - this time from an outswinging corner - another goal for Kane, a header from six yards. 22 min: Chilwell was a big contributor to Leicester\u2019s 9-0 win at Southampton a few weeks back. England could rack up a similar score here if they really want to. Especially if James Maddison is introduced later. 20 min: Rashford rushes back to help out Chilwell and nullify a Montenegro break. Chilwell curls over an inviting corner from the left. The defenders get themselves in a muddle and Kane doesn\u2019t even have to jump in order to guide a header into the net from six yards. England are on Easy Street. 17 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain puts an end to some decent play by Montenegro by winning the ball in midfield, setting up a rapid counter-attack that concludes with Rashford unloading a powerful shot that the keeper does well to push behind for a corner. 15 min: Montenegro enter the England half for the first time in a long time. And Vesovic scampers all the way into the box, wriggling past two defenders before Maguire comes across to poke the ball out for a corner. 13 min: Sancho runs on to a clipped pass and hooks it back into the danger zone from near the byline. Kane fluffs his header and as Mount hares in to try to prod the bouncing ball into the net from close range, Mijatovic throws himself at it to divert it away. 11 min: Chilwell drifted infield from the left mid-way inside the opposing half and flighted a pass over to Oxlade-Chamberlain on the far side of the box. The Liverpool man controlled it immaculately and then whacked a crisp low shot into the far corner to crown a dominant start by England. Excellent finish by the man who has had to wait 19 months for a start! 8 min: Alexander-Arnold sends over a freekick from the right, but it\u2019s too close to the goalkeeper. 6 min: Lovely play by Winks! He used his body well as he received a pass about 40 yards out and then threaded a precise ball through to Sancho on the right. The winger glided past his marker and fired a low pass across the face of goal. Sofranac made a heroic block to deny Kane a tap-in! 4 min: Oxlade runs on to pass down the right and chops over a decent cross. Mijatovic strides off his line to snaffle it. 3 min: Montenegro win the first corner of the game. Haksabanovic delivers to the near post, where Kane make a good block before England clear the danger. 2 min: Nifty play on the left between Chilwell, Rashford and Winks. But it peters out before anyone can get a cross in. Still, a bright opening by England. 1 min: We have kickoff! \u201cSilly question!\u201d announces Bob Zoellner. \u201cWhen the average age of the England team was calculated, were leap years added in with 366 days rather than 365 days for \u2018normal years\u2019?\u201d I\u2019ll level with you, Bob, I was just repeating the statistic given by man on the TV. I\u2019ll do my own calculations if I get a moment during the game ... Wembley looks to be about 85% full and not many of those in attendance seem inclined to join in with the national anthem, by the sounds of it. The players are in the tunnel, preparing to be led out by Kane, who drops the pennant while he\u2019s waiting. Remember that if this match doesn\u2019t pan out as planned, you can go back and say it was an omen. Inevitably, the first question is about the Sterling/Gomez palaver: \u201cIt was a difficult decision [to omit Sterling] but we made it earlier in the week and moved on from there. Everyone\u2019s focused on the game.\u201d Would he have left out Sterling if this were a key World Cup encounter? \u201cIt\u2019s a hypothetical question. I could give you an answer but it doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d Is there a risk of Sterling now feeling marginalised? \u201cNo, he\u2019s been really good, I have to say. It\u2019s behind us. We drew a line under it on Monday night and now it\u2019s all about qualification.\u201d What of the inclusion of Oxlade-Chamberlain, returning to the England starting lineup for the first time in nearly 19 months: \u201cHe\u2019s a good player. He\u2019s got speed and power and he\u2019s a goal threat. We want to play high up the pitch and he\u2019s got some fantastic attributes. It\u2019s a good night for him to come back in.\u201d So here are those lineups in full: England: Pickford, Alexander-Arnold, Stones, Maguire, Chilwell, Winks, Mount, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sancho, Rashford, Kane. Subs: Pope. Trippier, Maddison, Gomez, Rose, Wilson, Tomori, Henderson, Mings, Hudson-Odoi, Rice, Abraham Montenegro: Mijatovic; Vesovic, Sofranac, Simic, Radunovic; Hocko, Lagator, Vukcevic; Jovovic, Haksabanovic; Beciraj Subs: Sarkic, Raspopovic, Sekulic, Vujacic, Bulatovic, Kojasevic, Kopitovic, Mugosa, Boljevic, Jankovic, Petkovic Referee: A Lahoz (Spain) Despite the relatively gnarled central defence, this is England\u2019s youngest starting XI since 1959, with an average age of 23 years and 255 days. Southgate\u2019s selections have been revealed. The midfield looks to have much more thrust about it than in recent matches, especially with the inclusion of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Southgate has decided to go for experience in central defence in the form of the Maguire and Stones, which means no starting place for Tomori or Scratched Joe Gomez. England: Pickford, Alexander-Arnold, Stones, Maguire, Chilwell, Winks, Mount, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sancho, Rashford, Kane. Montenegro are in town! And England have a chance to gain the point that would secure the place at Euro 2020 that was in doubt right up until the format of this competition was revealed. As if that\u2019s not enticing enough, this is also England\u2019s 1000th match! No other country has played so many! That\u2019s a heritage to be proud of and there\u2019s no harm in taking a moment to think of all the players who have contributed a thread or two to this wonderful international footballing tapestry, from Segar Bastard to Harry Kane MBE via Joe Gaetjens, Antonio Rattin, Jim McCalliog, Jan Tomaszewki, Diego Maradona, Ray Houghton, David Gualtieri, Oyvind Leonhardsen, Mladen Petric and Mario Mandzukic. If there\u2019s anyone else you believe deserves a mention, please don\u2019t hesitate to say so. You might even spare a thought for Raheem Sterling, dispatched to the naughty step this week but not forgotten. Ultimately, though, today is about the here and now and, um, the future: Gareth Southgate is expected to send out a youthful lineup to signify his optimism that England are on the verge of radically improving that success rate of one trophy per every 1,000 matches. Here we go, here we go, here we go! Kick-off: 7.45pm GMT.",

      "bodyText": "Complaints about aged care providers have doubled in the past four years, prompting calls from Labor for the government to urgently increase resources. The problem was highlighted in a report into the Earle Haven nursing home released this week, which criticised the way complaints about the Gold Coast centre were managed. The inquiry found that the complaints commissioner had received numerous complaints between January 2016 and June 2018 about the operation of the centre that were not acted on. The nursing home closed in July, sparking chaotic scenes as 69 elderly high-care residents, many of whom had dementia, were effectively left homeless. Labor\u2019s aged care spokeswoman, Julie Collins, said she feared a repeat of the Earle Haven disaster if the way complaints were managed did not change. She said the government could not afford to wait until the final report of the royal commission, due late next year, to act. The number of complaints has skyrocketed from 3,936 in 2015-16 to 7,828 in 2019, an increase of almost 100%. But the number of staff dealing with complaints has not kept pace, rising only from 160 in 2015-16 to 170 last year. \u201cMy concern is that the complaints mechanism is still not there yet in terms of whether or not the commission has the power and the resources it needs to intervene early and resolve a complaint,\u201d Collins told Guardian Australia. \u201cI think given the doubling of complaints, the government needs to ensure that the complaints mechanism is robust and people have proper resolution to their complaints.\u201d According to the complaints commission\u2019s annual report, most complaints are referred back to the provider in question, with the commissioner saying it supports the complainant \u201cto resolve their concerns quickly and directly with the service provider\u201d. The so-called \u201cearly resolution\u201d of complaints was achieved for 5,317 complaints (93%) in 2018-19. Collins said the referral back to providers meant many issues were likely still to be unresolved, with families concerned about retribution against relatives if they escalated their concerns directly with the provider. \u201cThey hope that the regulator can resolve the complaint for them, but they then get pushed back to the provider. We are hearing from the royal commission that some of these don\u2019t actually get resolved. \u201cI think it is telling that we have had a doubling of complaints, they say 93% are resolved early or finalised, but what actually happens to them? How many of these are actually resolved at a provider level? We don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d The Earle Haven inquiry, undertaken by the former Australian Capital Territory chief minister Kate Carnell, found that the concerns of residents and their families were reflected in the high volume of complaints to regulators about the home. The complaints authority received six complaints in 2017, eight in 2018 and 16 in the first part of 2019. Some of the more serious complaints related to falls, poor wound management, a lack of staff and residents being left in urine-soaked beds. But when the complaints commissioner made a referral to the Aged Care Quality Agency, this information was not relayed. \u201cThe referral from the Complaints Commissioner noted only one other previous complaint had been received since 1 January 2016, with no related issues,\u201d the report said. \u201cOn this occasion it appears the Quality Agency was misinformed by the Complaints Commissioner in relation to the number of previous complaints received. \u201cFrom a process perspective, the complaints appear to have been managed with priority given to meeting internal performance expectations rather than achieving outcomes for the person making the complaints.\u201d The complaints commission and the quality agency have subsequently been amalgamated into the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, in an attempt to streamline the way complaints are handled by the independent regulator. The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, said through a spokesman there had been an increase in the number of full-time equivalent staff employed to deal with complaints. \u201cThe government supports all 23 recommendations [of the Earle Haven report] and has already made significant progress towards the changes required,\u201d he said. He pointed to the increased powers of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, and the development of information-sharing tools to better identify problem providers. Parliament will consider changes to give the independent regulator more powers, which are slated to come into force on 1 January. \u201cThis will ensure the commission is able to provide an end-to-end quality and safety function.\u201d In the minister\u2019s response to the Earle Haven report, he said he had written to chair of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Advisory Council, Angela Coote, \u201cfor advice on what further powers the Commission needs and to report back before Christmas\u201d. Colbeck faced questions in the Senate on Thursday about the government\u2019s response to the interim report into the aged care sector, which called for urgent action to address home care waiting lists, the use of restraints and the number of disabled young people in nursing homes. \u201cThe royal commission\u2019s report, as I\u2019ve said in this place before, put the government on notice, put the opposition on notice, put the industry and the entire Australian community on notice that these attitudes need to change,\u201d Colbeck said. \u201cAs I said on the afternoon of releasing the report, the government would carefully consider the matters that were raised.\u201d Scott Morrison has said more funding for the sector will be included in December\u2019s mid-year budget update.",

Kane helped himself to a hat-trick when he was allowed to swivel inside the area following Alexander-Arnold\u2019s cross and find the far corner. Kane is now above Alan Shearer, Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney in sixth place on England\u2019s all-time scoring list with 31. Weirdly, given England\u2019s total first-half dominance, Montenegro had forced Jordan Pickford into a pair of fine saves \u2013 a reminder that Southgate\u2019s team can be rather too loose at the back. More in keeping with the Montenegro display was the frustration showed by Marko Vesovic, who butted Rashford in the 33rd minute and got away with a yellow card. Abraham\u2019s goal, following Jadon Sancho\u2019s cross, was the seventh and it followed a comical own goal, shinned home by Sofranac after Mount\u2019s slightly scruffy shot. Mount had earlier had a goal disallowed for a fiendishly tight offside call. England face Kosovo in Pristina on Sunday, when Southgate will make changes, not least in recalling Sterling. The countdown to the finals has begun in earnest.",

      "bodyText": "Nigel Farage has stepped up his attacks on the Conservative party as it was claimed that senior Brexit party figures \u2013 including Ann Widdecombe \u2013 had been offered post-election roles or peerages as part of an attempt to get him to stand down more candidates at the general election. Widdecombe, the party\u2019s candidate in Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, was told she would be part of the government\u2019s post-election Brexit negotiating team if she stood down, according to senior Brexit party officials. Widdecombe, a former Tory minister, is a Brexit party MEP. Mike Greene, its candidate in Peterborough, had been offered a government education role, party officials said. Earlier on Thursday Farage said some offers had come from Boris Johnson\u2019s chief strategic adviser, Sir Edward Lister. In a stinging tweet, he wrote: \u201cThe system is corrupt and broken.\u201d The Conservative party denied that Lister had been calling Brexit party candidates. A spokesman said: \u201cNeither the Conservative party, nor its officials have offered Brexit party candidates jobs or peerages. We don\u2019t do electoral pacts - our pact is with the British people. \u201cThe only way to get Brexit done and unleash Britain\u2019s potential is to vote for your local Conservative candidate, otherwise the country runs the risk of another deadlocked Parliament, or even worse a Labour/SNP coalition led by Jeremy Corbyn who would subject Britain to two referendums in 2020.\u201d But the Brexit party\u2019s chairman, Richard Tice, reiterated Farage\u2019s claims. He said: \u201cSince our decision to stand down more than half our candidates for the good of this country, we have been dismayed by the behaviour of senior Conservative party figures. Our people have been offered jobs and titles to stand down as candidates on the last day of nominations, as part of a concerted campaign to undermine our party. \u201cWe made a unilateral gesture which should prevent a second referendum and keep Boris Johnson in office. We are proud and grateful that our candidates have resisted these distasteful overtures and stood firm.\u201d In a video directly uploaded to YouTube, Farage said he believed the prime minister was unaware that senior Brexit party figures had been offered peerages but it was a sign of the type of government he led. Farage said: \u201cThey then tried something that borders on corruption. Repeatedly, it\u2019s been suggested to me that I might like a seat in the House of Lords so I can go quietly. Every time this gets said my answer is the same: I\u2019m not for sale. I\u2019m not interested. \u201cKnowing they couldn\u2019t buy me off, there was a concerted attempt from people who work deep inside No 10 Downing Street \u2013 and I\u2019m not blaming Boris for this, I don\u2019t believe he would be part of this but it shows you the calibre of people he\u2019s got around him, the culture that exists in Westminster. \u201cHe bypassed me and went to other senior figures in the Brexit party suggesting that eight of them could go in the House of Lords and all they had to do was come to Nigel and convince him to stand down in a whole load more marginal seats. As you can imagine, I said I do not want, and will never have anything to do with, this kind of behaviour.\u201d In further confusion over exactly where candidates will be standing and how much is being guided from the party centrally, their candidate for Dudley North pulled out just minutes before nominations closed today. Rupert Lowe, a West Midlands MEP for the Brexit party, defied Farage\u2019s message this morning that they would be challenging Labour and said he had pulled out to prevent a Corbyn victory. Lowe\u2019s move came after Farage stood down candidates in 317 Tory-held seats to go after traditional Labour safe seats such as Dudley \u2013 and the pair were due to campaign there in the coming days. Earlier on Thursday Farage had said he was unlikely to vote for any political party at the general election after removing the Brexit party candidate from his constituency. Farage, who founded the Brexit party earlier this year, lives in a Tory-held seat in Kent, and said it was the first time he would not vote since 1992, when he said he spoiled his ballot paper. He initially sparked confusion on Wednesday when he suggested during an election tour in Ilford, east London, that he might vote Conservative, depending on what was included in their manifesto. He tweeted later that he had ruled out voting for the Tories. \u201cI very much doubt I\u2019ll vote,\u201d he said on Thursday while campaigning in Grimsby. \u201cIt\u2019s this very narrow party interest, that\u2019s all [the Tories] care about.\u201d \u201cI spoiled a paper in 1992 because I couldn\u2019t vote for John Major \u2013 I couldn\u2019t do it. ERM [European exchange rate mechanism], probably going to join the euro \u2026 I couldn\u2019t vote then.

His journey out, organised over months and supported by UNHCR and Amnesty International, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/14/a-long-flight-to-freedom-how-refugee-behrouz-boochani-finally-left-his-island-jail-behind\">took 34 hours and crossed three countries</a>.</p> <p><strong>Queensland remains under severe bushfire threat</strong>,<strong> </strong>with the state so dry that thunderstorms forecast at the weekend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/14/lightning-strikes-likely-to-spark-fires-as-thunderstorms-forecast-for-tinder-dry-queensland\">could bring lightning but no rain</a>. Emergency services were able to build stronger containment lines around many of the 75 bushfires burning across the state on Thursday, but dry storms and a continued heatwave in the south-east are expected to exacerbate conditions. The Bureau of Meteorology has little good news on the horizon, with Richard Wardle telling media: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very dry 2019 and we expect those very dry conditions to continue until 2020.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Nancy Pelosi has accused Donald Trump of bribery</strong>, saying the president\u2019s actions in seeking to cover his tracks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/nov/14/trump-news-today-live-impeachment-hearings-ukraine-democrats-roger-stone-latest-updates\">make \u201cwhat Nixon did look almost small\u201d</a>.

Held on Manus Island for six years \u2013 or 2,269 days \u2013Boochani secretly documented life inside the facility, where he witnessed fellow refugees shot, stabbed and murdered by guards, saw several die through medical neglect and watched others descend into mental anguish and suicide. His journey out, organised over months and supported by UNHCR and Amnesty International, took 34 hours and crossed three countries. Queensland remains under severe bushfire threat, with the state so dry that thunderstorms forecast at the weekend could bring lightning but no rain. Emergency services were able to build stronger containment lines around many of the 75 bushfires burning across the state on Thursday, but dry storms and a continued heatwave in the south-east are expected to exacerbate conditions. The Bureau of Meteorology has little good news on the horizon, with Richard Wardle telling media: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very dry 2019 and we expect those very dry conditions to continue until 2020.\u201d Nancy Pelosi has accused Donald Trump of bribery, saying the president\u2019s actions in seeking to cover his tracks make \u201cwhat Nixon did look almost small\u201d. On another bruising day of live hearings, the speaker of the House of Representatives chose not to mince her words: \u201cTo grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections. That\u2019s bribery.\u201d Meanwhile, two senior lawmakers from both parties are emerging as chief nemesis and defender of the president\u2013 the Democrat Adam Schiff and the Republican Devin Nunes have taken centre stage during the impeachment proceedings thus far. Rudy Giuliani also joked via telephone with the Guardian that he has \u201cvery good insurance\u201d should the president turn on his personal lawyer. The black-throated finch has been voted Australian bird of the year for 2019, beating the tawny frogmouth in a landslide. The highly endangered finch, which is under threat from the Adani Carmichael coalmine, was backed by a highly organised online campaign linking it to deforestation, the climate emergency and opposition to the mine. It won with 11,153 votes (35% of the total), 7,802 votes clear of second place. Overall, including first- and second-round votes, 18,387 people voted for the black-throated finch. The tawny frogmouth briefly held hopes of becoming the first nocturnal bird to win the poll but came a distant second with 3,351 votes. The magpie, which won the inaugural Guardian/BirdLife Australia 2017 bird of the year, slumped to fourth with 2,725 votes, and the ibis, which came second in 2017, dropped all the way to 10th, with only 1,147 votes. The superb fairy-wren came third, with 2,875 votes, the magpie fourth (2,725) and the laughing kookaburra fifth (2,650). Australia NSW police will review whether body cameras should be automatically turned on, with the commissioner, Mick Fuller, investigating whether the drawing of weapons could automatically turn on cameras within 100 metres via Bluetooth. Australia\u2019s biggest litigation funder has rejected the attorney general\u2019s claim that it is targeting mining companies, explaining that multiply class actions now under way are to do with breaches of corporate governance, not environmental issues. Queensland police have suspended an officer who pleaded guilty to computer hacking, more than three years after he leaked the address of a domestic abuse victim to her violent former partner. The world Germany\u2019s parliament has voted to make measles vaccinations compulsory, with parents who refuse to inoculate their children facing fines up to \u20ac2,500, starting next March. Dutch investigators have released new recordings which they claim show collusion between Moscow and Ukrainian separatists, blamed for the shooting down of MH17. Two Australian and US professors scheduled for release by the Taliban remain incarcerated. It\u2019s not yet clear when 50-year-old Timothy Weekes from Wagga Wagga will be freed. At least one person is dead and multiple people have been hurt at a high school shooting in California. A solo male shooter is believed to be still at large after attacking Saugus high in Santa Clarita, about 50km north of Los Angeles. China may be systematically falsifying its organ donation records, an Australian research paper has claimed, raising major concerns about the possible use of executed prisoners or other forced donors. Recommended reads It\u2019s 3pm on a weekday and, if anyone\u2019s going to end up at Sexpo, it\u2019s Brigid Delaney. \u201cA handful of us are pressed against a barrier, clapping a woman who just stuffed a three-foot (inflated) balloon down her throat. It just disappeared down her gullet and is now presumably entangled in her lower intestines like one of those seabirds that has swallowed a plastic bag.\u201d At the intersection of the sex toy industrial complex and a sort of \u201cRoyal Easter Show for adults\u201d, Sexpo is nothing if not eye-opening. But more than that, writes Delaney, it\u2019s completely hilarious. As land prices spiral globally, the appeal of tiny houses continues to rise. But as Wendy Syfret writes, with residences ranging between 22 and 40 square metres, they\u2019re a \u201ccurious mix of aspirational and off-putting: part of you wants to live in these dreamy matchboxes, another wonders how anyone could.\u201d An Australian YouTube show, Never Too Small, has become a viral global hit but, with city planning regulations dragging behind, can any of this ever become a reality in modern Australia? Listen The frontline of fire. It\u2019s been a catastrophic start to the bushfire season \u2013 so far four people have died and hundreds of houses have been destroyed. On this episode of the Full Story podcast the Guardian Australia environment reporter Lisa Cox explains how our fire season is changing, and we hear from people living on the frontline of the fires. Sport Australia have survived a late scare to continue their unbeaten start to World Cup qualifying, after the Socceroos edged Jordan 1-0 in Amman, courtesy of Adam Taggart\u2019s first-half winner. As important as the identity of the next Wallabies coach could be the contract on offer. While a four-year term until France 2023 seems sensible, if it\u2019s a bad fit, Rugby Australia risks a potentially costly payout if it gets it wrong, writes Bret Harris. And it wouldn\u2019t be Friday without David Squires \u2026 on A-Pocalyse Now: the search for Kurz, and Melbourne Victory\u2019s horror. Media roundup A tsunami warning has been issued for Indonesia after a powerful 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck offshore in the Molucca Sea, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. It\u2019s the worst rupture in relations between police and the Indigenous community since Palm Island, writes the Australian, as protests continue in the Northern Territory after the shooting of Kumanjayi Walker by a police officer. And the Weis family has slammed the global corporation Unilever for closing the Toowoomba factory where its famous ice-creams have been made for 60 years, with production moving to NSW, writes the Courier-Mail.

The British driver, who goes into this weekend\u2019s Brazilian Grand Prix having won his sixth world championship, believes F1 faces a difficult challenge but one on which he is committed to working. This week Formula One announced its intention to reach a target of becoming carbon neutral by 2030. The plan \u2013 announced by Chase Carey, chief executive of the F1 owner, Liberty Media \u2013 is a major initiative for the sport, which undertook a comprehensive study of its environmental footprint over the past 12 months. \u201cI don\u2019t see why it won\u2019t happen,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI am definitely open to working with F1 and the FIA. I have been talking to Chase for nearly three years saying we have to do something together. We haven\u2019t figured out what that role is but it is something in this area.\u201d Hamilton believes a concerted effort was required across the sport. \u201cAnything is possible as long as they mean it,\u201d he said of the proposals. \u201cYou have to put your mind to it. It\u2019s not like we have a lack of money to make the changes, the teams have to want to do it. My team, Mercedes, does. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard about Ferrari or any of the other teams but they need to be on the same journey because it is going to take the whole of the sport to make the change.\u201d F1\u2019s review revealed the sport produced 256,000 tons of CO2 in a season. With 10 teams competing across 21 races around the world and the calendar expanding to 22 meetings next year, achieving the target of a net carbon impact of zero in 11 years will be a major task. Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel was also vehement the sport should be acting swiftly. \u201cIt\u2019s a great message and it\u2019s about time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see people can make decisions and make a change. It is an ambitious target but I would like to see some of the goals achieved sooner. It is a must in our times and we can\u2019t afford to wait. \u201cThe challenge is quite clear. To improve our sport, enhance the show, grow passion based on the values that we share but make them sustainable. It is an incredible challenge but about time.\u201d F1 has also committed to making all grands prix fully sustainable events by 2025. The carbon zero target is to be pursued by the development of a carbon neutral power unit using synthetic fuel; using renewable energy across the sport\u2019s facilities, offices and factories; ensuring the logistics and travel are as efficient as possible and using carbon capture and tree-planting to offset anything that cannot be eliminated.",

Corbyn said the motion would not \u201cnecessarily\u201d make its way into the manifesto.</p> <p>He said freedom of movement would continue if the UK votes in a second referendum to stay in the EU. However, if Labour were to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU, it would involve a \u201cspecial arrangement\u201d on immigration and free movement, and he would want to expand rights for migrants to bring family members to the UK.</p> <p>Corbyn told the BBC: \u201cIf we are remaining members of the EU, which will be an option in the referendum that we will put, then obviously free movement continues.</p> <p>\u201cIf we come to a special arrangement with the EU and then there will be a recognition of the needs of European families to have the right of family reunion, the right to reside, and of course British people to work in different European countries.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, any Brexit deal negotiated by Labour which keeps close access to the single market would be likely to have fairly similar freedom of movement rules to those currently in place but it would not be exactly the same regime.</p> <p>Senior Labour figures argued that their position fulfils their conference policy of wanting to \u201cmaintain and expand\u201d freedom of movement rights, as they would maintain free movement for EU citizens already in the UK and one of their aims is expanding family reunion rights.</p> <p>Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, tweeted: \u201cThis is the actual resolution passed overwhelmingly at Labour party conference. I fully support the policy to \u2018maintain and extend free movement rights\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThe Labour party is committed to maintaining and extending freedom of movement rights.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour will not put an arbitrary target on immigration, as he defended the \u201cvalue of migration to society\u201d in the face of the Tory pledge to cut numbers. As the Conservatives and Labour clashed over immigration, Corbyn strongly rejected the idea of a limit on the number of people entering the country, saying: \u201cPutting arbitrary figures on it as successive governments have done simply doesn\u2019t work.\u201d He said he wanted to make it easier for migrants to bring their family members to the UK and for British workers to be able to work across Europe. Corbyn also accused the Conservatives of \u201cmaking up\u201d numbers and policy after Priti Patel, the home secretary, claimed a Labour government would lead to open borders and an extra 840,000 new entrants a year. The Labour leader explained his immigration policy after weeks of speculation about whether the party would adopt an aim to \u201cmaintain and expand freedom of movement rights\u201d, which was passed by members at autumn conference. Corbyn said the motion would not \u201cnecessarily\u201d make its way into the manifesto. He said freedom of movement would continue if the UK votes in a second referendum to stay in the EU. However, if Labour were to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU, it would involve a \u201cspecial arrangement\u201d on immigration and free movement, and he would want to expand rights for migrants to bring family members to the UK. Corbyn told the BBC: \u201cIf we are remaining members of the EU, which will be an option in the referendum that we will put, then obviously free movement continues. \u201cIf we come to a special arrangement with the EU and then there will be a recognition of the needs of European families to have the right of family reunion, the right to reside, and of course British people to work in different European countries.\u201d Ultimately, any Brexit deal negotiated by Labour which keeps close access to the single market would be likely to have fairly similar freedom of movement rules to those currently in place but it would not be exactly the same regime. Senior Labour figures argued that their position fulfils their conference policy of wanting to \u201cmaintain and expand\u201d freedom of movement rights, as they would maintain free movement for EU citizens already in the UK and one of their aims is expanding family reunion rights. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, tweeted: \u201cThis is the actual resolution passed overwhelmingly at Labour party conference. I fully support the policy to \u2018maintain and extend free movement rights\u2019. \u201cThe Labour party is committed to maintaining and extending freedom of movement rights. But the Tories will remove those rights from the EU 3 Million. We will maintain them. \u201cThe Tories break up families by barring spouses of British citizens, via an income requirement. Labour will scrap it, and extend freedom of movement rights to all those legally entitled to be here, including our own citizens among others.\u201d Labour argued that the motion did not specifically refer to geographic expansion of free movement beyond the EU but those who drafted the motion said their intention had been to argue for a policy of open borders beyond Europe. Ana Oppenheim, a spokesperson for the Labour Campaign for Free Movement, said: \u201cThe formulation of \u2018defend and extend\u2019 captures our position well \u2013 that we cannot give an inch to any attacks on existing migrants\u2019 rights, and that, in principle, we want to expand free movement beyond Europe\u2019s borders. That clearly doesn\u2019t force Labour to immediately abolish all immigration rules, and it is also possible to honestly interpret the motion a different way.\u201d Some in Labour take a different view, with Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, saying on Wednesday that victory in the election would mean taking a tough line on free movement of workers. McCluskey told the Guardian on Wednesday that shadow cabinet members should not upset Labour\u2019s carefully crafted Brexit position during the election and that he would oppose any attempts to extend free movement. \u201cWe will have to see what\u2019s in the manifesto, but I don\u2019t think [what conference voted for] is a sensible approach and I will be expressing that view,\u201d he said, adding he was keen to shore up the party\u2019s support in marginal seats in the Midlands and north of England, both of which are being targeted by Boris Johnson. With the Conservatives seeking to make migration a key election issue, McCluskey said Labour needed to show how it was going to prevent pay and conditions from being undercut before it could consider relaxing its stance. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong in my view to have any greater free movement of labour unless you get stricter labour market regulation.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The black-throated finch has been voted Australian bird of the year for 2019, beating the tawny frogmouth in a landslide. The highly endangered finch, which is under threat from the expansion of the Adani Carmichael coalmine, was backed by a highly organised online campaign linking it to deforestation, the climate emergency and opposition to the mine. It won with 11,153 votes (35% of the total), and 7,802 votes clear of second. Overall, including first- and secon- round votes, 18,387 people voted for the black-throated finch. The small passerine held a huge lead from early in the poll, winning the first round with 7,234 votes, more than 3,000 clear of second \u2013 and then extended that lead in the final round. Fewer than 800 individuals now exist of the southern black-throated finch subspecies, making it the most endangered bird in the final 10. The northern subspecies is more abundant and less threatened. The tawny frogmouth briefly held hopes of becoming the first nocturnal bird to win the poll, but came a distant second with 3,351 votes. The magpie, which won the inaugural Guardian/BirdLife Australia 2017 bird of the year, slumped to fourth, with 2,725 votes, and the ibis, which came second in 2017, dropped all the way to 10th, and only 1,147 votes. The superb fairy-wren came third, with 2,875 votes, the magpie fourth (2,725) and the laughing kookaburra fifth (2,650). The wedge-tailed eagle (2,402), the sulphur-crested cockatoo (2,341), the willie wagtail (1,970), the rainbow lorikeet (1,711) and the ibis followed. Sean Dooley from BirdLife Australia paid tribute to the finch and said the victory was well-deserved. \u201cAs someone who has gone out and seen that bird in nature, they are subtly stunning. No illustration I have seen has done justice to the beauty of the bird in real life. They are a literal breath-taker when you see them.\u201d The black-throated finch\u2019s win struck a different kind of note. \u201cPeople could be cynical and say nobody had heard of this bird five years ago, and that is exactly the point,\u201d he said. \u201cThat just shows how the awareness of Australian birds is growing. \u201cWhen we did the first poll in 2017 we essentially focused on birds we thought people would recognise. But the sad reality is that many of our birds are becoming iconic for all the wrong reasons, they are now emblematic of the extinction crisis. \u201cThey have become characters of how we can express our grief in what we are losing in nature.\u201d Earlier, the poll was rocked by scandal after the discovery of a sophisticated voter fraud operation in favour of the sulphur-crested cockatoo. Thousands of votes were added in minutes for the cockatoo \u2013 all automated and from the same origin \u2013 with other votes added to the finch and the rainbow lorikeet in an attempt to disguise the ruse. All fraudulent votes were promptly identified and removed. Drama also erupted on the final day of round one voting after a nail-biting three-way tussle between the wedge-tailed eagle, the galah and the willie wagtail came down to a handful of write-in votes. Under a new two-round structure, this year\u2019s poll had a first round of voting between 50 birds, with the top 10 progressing to a final round to crown the winner. With three hours left in the first round, a huge surge for both the eagle and galah meant the wagtail, in ninth, was suddenly at risk of dropping out of the top 10 altogether. In the end, the galah missed out by only four votes. Dooley said the biannual competition was \u201ca fantastic celebration\u201d, a joyous event and a way to raise awareness of bird conservation. \u201cI think bird lovers are the true quiet Australians,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cGenerally they haven\u2019t made a fuss about it, partly in the past it\u2019s been seen as a bit daggy. \u201cBut I remember I travelled the country in 2002, I would rock up with my binoculars, in the most archetypal country towns, and there would always be someone at the pub or cafe who loved their birds. \u201cHaving something like this shows people that they are not the only birder in the village. Its just fantastic and a lot of fun.

Dozens of weather warnings remain in place around the country, from Oxfordshire to Yorkshire and across the West Midlands, where more than 100 schools were forced to close on Thursday. The mayor of the Sheffield city region, Dan Jarvis, described the flood-stricken village of Fishlake, near Doncaster, as having \u201cthe feel of a disaster movie\u201d. As flood-affected families braced for further downpours, the leaders of six councils demanded immediate and long-term financial support to recover from the devastation. The leaders of councils in Doncaster, Rotherham, Sheffield, Barnsley, Bassetlaw and Kirklees warned of \u201cconsiderable and lasting damage on a wide scale\u201d, including to power plants and transport infrastructure, and called for funding increases to help them cope with future floods. In the absence of detailed official figures, the Guardian contacted local authorities in all flood-affected areas and found that at least 1,758 properties had been flooded across Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire. The figure is more than double the official Environment Agency estimate of 830 properties flooded. The worst effects of the floods were felt in Doncaster, where 970 properties were affected and more than 1,200 people were evacuated after the River Don burst its banks nearly a week ago. There were a further 450 properties flooded in Nottinghamshire \u2013 200 in the centre of Worksop, 30 in Retford and 50 in the pit village of Shireoaks, with Mansfield and Newark also badly hit \u2014 and more than 40 in Lincolnshire.

According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 4,321 properties have been advised to evacuate across South Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire, with more than 800 flooded.

      "bodyText": "Judges at the international criminal court (ICC) have authorised a full-scale investigation into allegations of mass persecution and crimes against humanity that forced at least 600,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee Myanmar into neighbouring Bangladesh. The ruling, which sets a significant precedent in expanding the jurisdiction of the war crimes court, is the second move against Myanmar this week at international tribunals in The Hague. On Monday, a submission was made by the Gambia to the international court of justice (ICJ) accusing Myanmar of genocide through the murder, rape and destruction of communities in the country\u2019s western Rakhine state. The ICC decision, announced on Thursday, follows a request by the court\u2019s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, earlier this year for a formal investigation into alleged ethnic cleansing since 2016. Myanmar is not a party to the Rome statute that established the ICC, but its neighbour, Bangladesh, has accepted the court\u2019s jurisdiction. By declaring that the ICC exercises jurisdiction over crimes where part of the alleged criminal conduct \u2013 in this case mass deportation \u2013 takes place on the territory of a state party, the ICC has extended its international law-enforcement role. A similar argument has been presented at the ICC on behalf of Syrian refugees who have been forced to flee to neighbouring Jordan, which, like Bangladesh, is a signatory to the Rome statute. In its decision on Thursday, the ICC authorised the prosecutor to \u201cproceed with an investigation for the alleged crimes within the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction in the situation in the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh/Republic of the Union of Myanmar\u201d. Three judges in the ICC\u2019s pre-trial chamber, Judge Olga Herrera Carbuccia, Judge Robert Fremr and Judge Geoffrey Henderson, found \u201ca reasonable basis to believe widespread and/or systematic acts of violence may have been committed that could qualify as the crimes against humanity of deportation across the Myanmar-Bangladesh border and persecution on grounds of ethnicity and/or religion against the Rohingya population\u201d. The chamber did not assess whether other associated war crimes may have been committed, but said they could nonetheless form part of the prosecutor\u2019s future investigation. Welcoming the ruling, Bensouda said: \u201cThis is a significant development, sending a positive signal to the victims of atrocity crimes in Myanmar and elsewhere \u2026 We hope that through our work, we can bring justice to the victims, wherever our jurisdictional conditions are met. My investigation will seek to uncover the truth.

Marzuki Darusman, chair of the UN fact-finding mission on Myanmar, said last year there was an \u201congoing genocide\u201d in Rakhine. Myanmar\u2019s population is overwhelmingly Buddhist, and the Rohingya, who are Muslim, have been stigmatised and targeted in attacks. Buddhist nationalists, led by firebrand monks, have organised an Islamophobic campaign calling for them to be expelled. Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar\u2019s de facto ruler, has been condemned for her refusal to intervene and protect the Rohingya. In a statement, the ICC said: \u201cVictims unanimously insist that they want an investigation by the court and many of [those] consulted \u2026 believe that only justice and accountability can ensure that the perceived circle of violence and abuse comes to an end.\u201d Between 600,000 and one million Rohingya were forcibly displaced from Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh from 2016 as a result of ethnic cleansing, according to numerous human rights reports.

Industrial production, the main engine of the Chinese economy, grew at annual rate of 4.7% in October, down from 5.8% in the previous month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The slump mirrored a drop in retail sales growth back to a near 16-year trough and the weakest growth in investment in new plant and machinery on record. Analysts said uncertainty about a possible pact between Beijing and Washington over a \u201cfirst stage\u201d trade deal dampened business and consumer confidence. This week Donald Trump said he would increase tariffs on Chinese imports unless Beijing agreed to a broad set of demands that would open its domestic markets to US competition.

A combination of soaring rents and more families without accommodation pushed spending on emergency housing to almost \u00a31.1bn in England in the year to April 2019, analysis of figures from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government shows.

      "body": "<p>The extraordinary story of an ancient wine cup that was awarded to the marathon winner of the first modern Olympics before being smuggled out of Greece by a notorious Nazi has been brought to light after its return to Athens.</p> <p>The 6th century BC pottery vessel was bestowed upon Spyros Louis, a water carrier, when he <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyridon_Louis\">unexpectedly won the inaugural marathon</a> in 1896. Then it went missing.</p> <p>Georgios Kivvadias, director of the vase collections at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, said: \u201cIn 2012, when asked to investigate what had happened to it, I began checking bibliographies and archives. It was thought it was inventoried in our archives but that wasn\u2019t the case at all.\u201d</p> <p>What followed were two years of detective work before the archaeologist eventually found the vessel, decorated with an image of two black-figured athletes against a clay-red background, at the University of M\u00fcnster, in Germany.</p> <p>The double-handled cup \u2013 originally discovered in a tomb in Thebes \u2013 was acquired by the university in 1986.</p> <p>On Wednesday the cup was formally repatriated in a handover ceremony at the museum, where the university\u2019s rector spoke of the \u201cbittersweet\u201d experience of giving it up, and Greece\u2019s culture minister, Lina Mendoni, spoke of the gratitude of the Greeks for getting it back.</p> <p>\u201cThe noble gesture of the university of M\u00fcnster is a very important gesture of the German people to the Greek people,\u201d she told an audience gathered at the museum. \u201cCultural heritage belongs to the people who created it.\u201d</p> <p>How the ancient vase got to Germany may have played no small role in the university\u2019s decision to hand it back.</p> <p>Kivvadias said: \u201cAfter Louis was handed the pottery, it disappeared until 1934 when it re-appeared in the hands of Werner Peek, an archaeologist who had won a grant to work at the German Archaeological Institute in Athens. Peek had amassed a collection of antiquities during his time here in the thirties and probably bought it on the art market in Athens.\u201d</p> <p>The connoisseur of ancient artworks and respected classical philologist was also an ardent Nazi sympathiser and antisemite.</p> <p>Peek later confessed he handed his entire 68-strong collection to Hermann G\u00f6ring, the notorious Nazi military leader, when he paid a visit to Athens in 1934 \u2013 seven years before the Wehrmacht occupied Greece.</p> <p>G\u00f6ring, one of the architects of the Third Reich police state and later associated with the plundering of Jewish treasures, concealed the antiquities in diplomatic pouches.</p> <p>\u201cThe cup was smuggled out of the country with the rest of his collection by G\u00f6ring,\u201d Kivvadias told the Guardian. \u201cThen when [Peek] returned in 1937 it ended up with him in East Germany, where he lived for years, was allowed to travel freely and taught as a professor.</p> <p>\u201cIt was only when he went to the West in the late 1980s that he decided to sell the collection to the University of M\u00fcnster, which acquired it without knowing the exact origins of the pieces.\u201d</p> <p>At a time when Athens has stepped up its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/31/greece-sculpture-swap-athens-partheon-elgin-marbles-boris-johnson\">campaign to retrieve the Parthenon</a> marbles from the British museum \u2013 ahead of the nation\u2019s bicentennial independence celebrations \u2013 the repatriation of the cup could not be more timely.</p> <p>The vessel, currently on display in the National Archaeological Museum, will remain in Athens until early next year, when it will be exhibited at a museum chronicling the history of the Olympics in ancient Olympia, the birthplace and venue of the original games.</p> <p>Dr Erofili Kollia, the director of the Archeological Museum of Olympia, said: \u201cIt will have pride of place here. The piece is hugely significant both as an artwork whose value is undisputed and because it was given to Louis, the victor of the first marathon when the modern Olympic games were revived. We are overjoyed that it will be here, with us, again.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The extraordinary story of an ancient wine cup that was awarded to the marathon winner of the first modern Olympics before being smuggled out of Greece by a notorious Nazi has been brought to light after its return to Athens. The 6th century BC pottery vessel was bestowed upon Spyros Louis, a water carrier, when he unexpectedly won the inaugural marathon in 1896. Then it went missing. Georgios Kivvadias, director of the vase collections at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, said: \u201cIn 2012, when asked to investigate what had happened to it, I began checking bibliographies and archives. It was thought it was inventoried in our archives but that wasn\u2019t the case at all.\u201d What followed were two years of detective work before the archaeologist eventually found the vessel, decorated with an image of two black-figured athletes against a clay-red background, at the University of M\u00fcnster, in Germany. The double-handled cup \u2013 originally discovered in a tomb in Thebes \u2013 was acquired by the university in 1986. On Wednesday the cup was formally repatriated in a handover ceremony at the museum, where the university\u2019s rector spoke of the \u201cbittersweet\u201d experience of giving it up, and Greece\u2019s culture minister, Lina Mendoni, spoke of the gratitude of the Greeks for getting it back. \u201cThe noble gesture of the university of M\u00fcnster is a very important gesture of the German people to the Greek people,\u201d she told an audience gathered at the museum. \u201cCultural heritage belongs to the people who created it.\u201d How the ancient vase got to Germany may have played no small role in the university\u2019s decision to hand it back. Kivvadias said: \u201cAfter Louis was handed the pottery, it disappeared until 1934 when it re-appeared in the hands of Werner Peek, an archaeologist who had won a grant to work at the German Archaeological Institute in Athens. Peek had amassed a collection of antiquities during his time here in the thirties and probably bought it on the art market in Athens.\u201d The connoisseur of ancient artworks and respected classical philologist was also an ardent Nazi sympathiser and antisemite. Peek later confessed he handed his entire 68-strong collection to Hermann G\u00f6ring, the notorious Nazi military leader, when he paid a visit to Athens in 1934 \u2013 seven years before the Wehrmacht occupied Greece. G\u00f6ring, one of the architects of the Third Reich police state and later associated with the plundering of Jewish treasures, concealed the antiquities in diplomatic pouches. \u201cThe cup was smuggled out of the country with the rest of his collection by G\u00f6ring,\u201d Kivvadias told the Guardian. \u201cThen when [Peek] returned in 1937 it ended up with him in East Germany, where he lived for years, was allowed to travel freely and taught as a professor. \u201cIt was only when he went to the West in the late 1980s that he decided to sell the collection to the University of M\u00fcnster, which acquired it without knowing the exact origins of the pieces.\u201d At a time when Athens has stepped up its campaign to retrieve the Parthenon marbles from the British museum \u2013 ahead of the nation\u2019s bicentennial independence celebrations \u2013 the repatriation of the cup could not be more timely. The vessel, currently on display in the National Archaeological Museum, will remain in Athens until early next year, when it will be exhibited at a museum chronicling the history of the Olympics in ancient Olympia, the birthplace and venue of the original games. Dr Erofili Kollia, the director of the Archeological Museum of Olympia, said: \u201cIt will have pride of place here. The piece is hugely significant both as an artwork whose value is undisputed and because it was given to Louis, the victor of the first marathon when the modern Olympic games were revived. We are overjoyed that it will be here, with us, again.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Labour party has nothing to fear from a voting system that ensures parliament closely reflects the balance of opinion held by the British people.</p> <p>We support Make Votes Matter\u2019s campaign for proportional representation. We believe Labour should fight for PR and we are not alone. Seventy-eight constituency Labour parties and two affiliated unions have formally called for PR in the last two years. But, at the very least, Labour must now commit to reviewing the voting system in our planned constitutional convention.</p> <p>The Brexit crisis has tested our constitution to near destruction, bitterly divided the country, and left millions feeling unrepresented at Westminster. We cannot simply hope that politics goes back to normal. We must lead the way to a democratic rebirth \u2013 transforming the political paralysis of recent years into a modern, dynamic and optimistic democracy for the many, not the few. The countries that come closest to this ideal all achieved what they have through PR systems.</p> <p>Including electoral reform in the remit of the convention is a small clarification that could make a huge difference. Not only will it show Labour is serious about democratising the UK, but it will help attract the votes needed to see off a Conservative majority.

      "bodyText": "The Labour party has nothing to fear from a voting system that ensures parliament closely reflects the balance of opinion held by the British people. We support Make Votes Matter\u2019s campaign for proportional representation. We believe Labour should fight for PR and we are not alone. Seventy-eight constituency Labour parties and two affiliated unions have formally called for PR in the last two years. But, at the very least, Labour must now commit to reviewing the voting system in our planned constitutional convention. The Brexit crisis has tested our constitution to near destruction, bitterly divided the country, and left millions feeling unrepresented at Westminster. We cannot simply hope that politics goes back to normal. We must lead the way to a democratic rebirth \u2013 transforming the political paralysis of recent years into a modern, dynamic and optimistic democracy for the many, not the few. The countries that come closest to this ideal all achieved what they have through PR systems. Including electoral reform in the remit of the convention is a small clarification that could make a huge difference. Not only will it show Labour is serious about democratising the UK, but it will help attract the votes needed to see off a Conservative majority. Most importantly, it promises an exciting opportunity for citizens to consider, deliberate, and decide for themselves how the House of Commons should be elected. We call on Labour to pledge that the constitutional convention will review the voting system in the forthcoming manifesto.

This remained in force until March to May 1974. Maximum speed restrictions, aimed at reducing energy consumption, were again introduced from December 1974 through to May 1977.</p> <p>When the speed of a petrol-engined car is reduced from 70mph to its optimal speed of 55mph to 60mph, its petrol consumption falls by some 17%. Given that demand for road transport fuels is around 44m litres of petrol and a little over 81m litres of diesel per day, that brings petrol consumption down by 7.5m litres and diesel by 13.75m litres per day. The 1970s restrictions were introduced to save energy. But they also brought down pollution and carbon emissions: every litre of petrol consumed produces 2.3kg of carbon dioxide (diesel produces 2.68kg).</p> <p>In 2016, road transport contributed nearly 21% of the EU\u2019s total emissions of carbon dioxide. There is an urgent need to cut greenhouse gases. The government could bring down emissions rapidly by reintroducing maximum speed restrictions \u2013 while we wait for petrol and diesel-engined vehicles to be phased out altogether.

      "bodyText": "In December 1973, when the Opec countries cut back supplies of oil to the west, the UK and the US introduced a maximum national speed limit of 50mph on all roads in order to reduce petrol consumption (Netherlands lowers speed limit to comply with pollution court ruling, 14 November). This remained in force until March to May 1974. Maximum speed restrictions, aimed at reducing energy consumption, were again introduced from December 1974 through to May 1977. When the speed of a petrol-engined car is reduced from 70mph to its optimal speed of 55mph to 60mph, its petrol consumption falls by some 17%. Given that demand for road transport fuels is around 44m litres of petrol and a little over 81m litres of diesel per day, that brings petrol consumption down by 7.5m litres and diesel by 13.75m litres per day. The 1970s restrictions were introduced to save energy. But they also brought down pollution and carbon emissions: every litre of petrol consumed produces 2.3kg of carbon dioxide (diesel produces 2.68kg). In 2016, road transport contributed nearly 21% of the EU\u2019s total emissions of carbon dioxide. There is an urgent need to cut greenhouse gases. The government could bring down emissions rapidly by reintroducing maximum speed restrictions \u2013 while we wait for petrol and diesel-engined vehicles to be phased out altogether. The adoption of electric cars could be incentivised, perhaps by exempting them from such speed restrictions.

      "bodyText": "British taxpayers face paying out for a large fine after the EU launched a legal action against Boris Johnson\u2019s government over his failure to abide by the law and nominate a candidate for the new European commission. Despite knowing for weeks that the UK would remain in the EU beyond 31 October, when a new EU executive had been due to be in place, Downing Street failed to put someone forward to join the bloc\u2019s 28-strong top team. Johnson instead belatedly claimed in a letter sent on Wednesday evening that he had been unable to make an international appointment due to purdah rules ahead of the general election on 12 December. A spokeswoman for the European commission said the UK had breached its legal obligations despite the prime minister\u2019s repeated claims in public that he would not defy the law. The move could ultimately see the UK government dragged to answer for itself at the European court of justice, where judges have the power to issue large fines on member states that fail to live up to EU law. The commission spokeswoman said the UK had until 22 November \u201cat the latest to provide their views\u201d on its formal infringement notice. The incoming European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, plans to have the EU executive team in place by 1 December. In the commission\u2019s response to the UK government\u2019s letter, a spokeswoman said officials had \u201canalysed this reply and considers that the UK is in breach of its EU treaty obligations\u201d. \u201cThe European commission recalls that, in accordance with established EU case law, a member state may not invoke provisions prevailing in its domestic legal system to justify failure to observe obligations arising under Union law\u201d, the commission said. For the European commission to be legally constituted, it needs all 28 member states to have a representative. A former ambassador to Ireland and France, Sir Julian King, is the current commissioner from the UK. The move towards an infringement procedure by the commission suggests that, despite the earlier rejection of other nominations made by France, Hungary and Romania, 1 December remains a realisable target for the new commission to be up and running. The formation of the new commission headed by the former German defence minister has already been delayed by a month owing to the European parliament\u2019s rejection of nominees from three member states. France\u2019s commission candidate, Thierry Breton, was belatedly confirmed in his post as commissioner for the single market on Thursday despite only narrowly passing an examination of his financial declarations by the European parliament\u2019s legal affairs committee earlier in the week. Breton, a former chief executive at the software firm Atos, managed to assuage MEPs\u2019 concerns during a grilling on Thursday over a potential conflict of interest between his links to tech companies and him being the next single market and industry commissioner.",

But Giuliani joked that he had good \u201cinsurance\u201d in case Trump did turn on him, amid speculation Republicans will seek to frame him as a rogue actor. In a telephone interview with the Guardian, in response to a question about whether he was nervous that Trump might \u201cthrow him under a bus\u201d in the impeachment crisis, Giuliani said, with a slight laugh: \u201cI\u2019m not, but I do have very, very good insurance, so if he does, all my hospital bills will be paid.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Robert Costello, who was also on the call, then interjected: \u201cHe\u2019s joking.\u201d Whether it was a joke or a veiled threat, Giuliani has emerged as a key player in the impeachment proceedings, which center on the question of whether Trump sought to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Testimony from diplomats in the lead-up to this week\u2019s first public impeachment hearing has consistently pointed a finger of blame at Giuliani, who led the administration\u2019s secret effort to pressure the Ukrainians to launch a corruption investigation into Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. In testimony, Bill Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state, have described how Trump seemed to care more about investigating Biden, his possible opponent in the 2020 election, than protecting a key ally from Russian aggression.

Asked about whether he believed Trump would remain loyal to him, amid speculation Republican lawmakers could seek to pin the blame for alleged wrongdoing on Giuliani personally in an effort to shield the president, Giuliani said he believed Trump, who he has known for three decades, was a \u201cvery loyal guy\u201d. \u201cI acted properly as his lawyer,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI did what a good lawyer is supposed to do. I dug up evidence that helped to show the case against him was false; that there was a great deal of collusion going on someplace else other than Russia. And then I stepped on the number one minefield, which is Joe Biden, who is heavily protected by the Washington press corps.\u201d Sondland told Congress last month that Trump instructed his US diplomats to work through Giuliani to make it clear Ukraine\u2019s access to the White House was contingent on their launching an investigation into his opponents. The White House denounced the impeachment hearings as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d and downplayed the serious corruption allegations. Giuliani\u2019s own ties to Ukraine date back to 2003. A Guardian investigation of his dealings in Ukraine, based on interviews with associates and business partners, showed Giuliani used his relationship with the president to gain access to high-ranking prosecutors and officials, and that his business associates traded on Giuliani\u2019s name to seek to legitimize dubious business ventures. Two of Giuliani\u2019s business partners, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, helped to connect Giuliani to powerful Ukrainian prosecutors who claimed to have information about Hunter Biden, but also wanted to use Giuliani\u2019s name to benefit their interests. Parnas and Fruman, two Soviet-born Americans, were arrested on charges of violating campaign finance laws while attempting to travel to Vienna, shortly after they met Giuliani in Washington. Giuliani is also reportedly under investigation for whether his work in Ukraine broke laws on foreign lobbying. Federal prosecutors are also reportedly investigating Giuliani for possible campaign finance violations and failure to register as a foreign agent, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The White House did not return a request for comment.",

No other details were disclosed, but Turkey said earlier on Thursday that a Briton was among eight Islamic State suspects it had deported as part of a controversial push to repatriate foreign Isis suspects held in Turkish jails. Security sources told the Guardian the suspect was not a major Isis figure and may only have travelled to the region recently. It is not known how many UK nationals are held in Turkey.

The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases, although its standing policy is that any Briton who returns to the UK from having taken part in the conflict in Syria or Iraq must expect to be investigated by police and could be prosecuted. About 1,200 foreigners are being held in detention centres in Turkey along with 287 more captured recently in Turkey\u2019s invasion of Kurdish-held parts of Syria last month. About 900 Britons are believed to have gone out to fight for Isis in Syria and Iraq. Half of them have already come back to the UK, with some remaining under active monitoring since their return.

Demobilised as a captain in 1946, he returned to Cambridge, took his degree and, after qualifying as a solicitor in 1949, set up his own practice in Mayfair, central London.

      "bodyText": "Campaigners for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland are planning legal action over government delays in converting civil partnerships into marriages. With the first weddings expected around Valentine\u2019s Day this coming February, more than 1,200 gay couples already in partnerships have discovered bureaucratic barriers to them tying the knot. Civil partnerships cannot be dissolved within their first two years in Northern Ireland and can only subsequently end on the grounds of separation, unreasonable behaviour or desertion. When same-sex marriages were introduced in England and Wales in 2014, the legislation provided an automatic route for those already in civil partnerships to convert their union into a marriage. A similar procedure has not yet been organised by the government\u2019s Northern Ireland Office. Westminster passed the Northern Ireland Executive Formation Act in October, formally decriminalising abortion and legislating for same-sex marriage in the region. Anti-abortion groups led by the Democratic Unionist party tried to prevent the moves by recalling the Stormont assembly for the first time in almost three years but failed. As the law stands, the 1,200 couples in Northern Ireland who already have civil partnerships will not be able to convert to full married status in the new year. Legal action is being prepared to challenge the delays. The Love Equality campaign said that a same-sex couple in a civil partnership, two Christian couples and a Christian minister will bring the legal challenge. Amanda McGurk entered a civil partnership with Cara McCann earlier this year before the law changed and was devastated to learn she could miss out on her dream wedding. \u201cMy heart broke again,\u201d she said, \u201cand I can assure you that I was not the only person in that room whose heart broke and I could feel other hearts breaking right beside me. \u201cIt was absolutely horrific to realise that we had now gotten so close again, to have it ripped away from us and the realisation that, again, some of us were going to be treated as second-class citizens within our own community.\u201d McCann said: \u201cJust a few weeks ago, I sat in a room in Stormont House with government ministers and officials and was told that I could become a married woman in the new year. Now the government has changed its mind. \u201cOur campaign for equal marriage has always been about rejecting second-class citizenship. We have already won our campaign in parliament.

The 62-year-old University of St Andrews professor, who is wanted in Spain over her role in the Catalan independence movement, insisted on Thursday she should not be extradited to face a \u201cshow trial\u201d, where she believes a guilty verdict would be inevitable. The highly regarded head of the university\u2019s economics school returned to Scotland via Belgium when she fled from Spain along with the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont and three other members of his team after their government was forced from office in November 2017.

Lawyers acting for National Trading Standards told a jury at Leeds crown court that the pair tried to \u201cmilk profit\u201d from genuine fans by reselling tickets for Ed Sheeran gigs, the Chelsea flower show, and the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play at inflated prices. Peter Hunter and David Smith, who traded as Ticket Wiz and BZZ from the home they shared in north London, are charged with four offences, including three of fraudulent trading and one of possessing articles for fraud. They deny the charges. \u201cAn inevitable consequence of their behaviour was that they reduced the number of face-value tickets that were available to purchase,\u201d said Jonathan Sandiford, prosecuting. \u201cThe two defendants were internet ticket touts and were also dishonest fraudsters motivated by greed. \u201cThat greed caused them to exploit the love and passion that many people have for their favourite music acts.\u201d The prosecution said Hunter and Smith used bot software to harvest tickets, as well as a specialist browser called Insomniac, that allowed them to masquerade as multiple consumers. They allegedly paid \u00a34m for tickets, including nearly 30,000 from just one company, and sold them for \u00a310.8m over two and a half years, indicating an average trading profit of \u00a352,000 per week. They are also alleged to have used credit cards in different names and employed staff to maximise the number of tickets they could obtain, bypassing limits on the number that could be sold to one person. A search on the home of Smith and Hunter found 112 credit cards in more than 30 names, according to the prosecution. Sandiford said the use of multiple identities allowed them to take up a number of places in the queue, as well as disguise the fact they were buying tickets only to resell them for profit. He said this broke terms and conditions imposed by primary ticket companies such as Ticketmaster and worked to the detriment of fans. \u201cThe defendants were competing with consumers to buy tickets that should have been available at face value,\u201d Sandiford said. \u201cIt essentially manipulated the market against consumers.\u201d He accused them of \u201cprofiteering\u201d by using the largest secondary ticketing companies \u2013 Viagogo, StubHub, Seatwave and GetMeIn \u2013 to charge inflated prices. Buyers should have been told the tickets could cause them to be refused entry but they were not, Sandiford said. One of the fraud charges relates to speculative selling, whereby touts offer tickets for sale that they do not have, on the assumption that they will be able to get hold of them later. Sandiford said this amounted to lying to consumers. He referred to specific events allegedly targeted by the pair, such as Sheeran\u2019s stadium tour in 2017.

      "body": "<p>Nan Goldin photographs her life, her friendships and loves, her losses and addictions, good times and bad times. Little, if anything, is off-limits. The first large show of Goldin\u2019s work in the <a href=\"https://www.mariangoodman.com/exhibitions/london/\">UK in almost two decades</a> might be accused of raking over old ground. But Goldin often returns to her past, reincorporating older images in new work, adding previously unseen photographs, or presenting mechanical carousel slide-shows in digitised and soundtracked narrative sequences.</p> <p>And so it is here, in an exhibition that takes us from black and white to colour, from snatches of old Super 8 footage to answering-machine conversations, from a fire-eating queen in Manila to a drag bar in Boston. Here is someone crashed in a hotel corridor, stranded on the carpet between closed doors and the remains of room-service dinners. Here are blown-up airplane window sunsets and what, the title tells us ominously, is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.artnet.com/auctions/artists/nan-goldin/the-sky-on-the-twilight-of-philippines-suicide-winterthur-switzerland\">the sky on the twilight of </a><a href=\"https://www.artnet.com/auctions/artists/nan-goldin/the-sky-on-the-twilight-of-philippines-suicide-winterthur-switzerland\">Philippine\u2019s suicide, Wint</a><a href=\"https://www.artnet.com/auctions/artists/nan-goldin/the-sky-on-the-twilight-of-philippines-suicide-winterthur-switzerland\">erthur, Switzerland</a>\u201d. This large-scale print gives us a bilious dirty orange sky, a silhouetted chimney, a sodium-yellow streetlight glowing in the dusk.

These days such imagery \u2013 and the celebration of these lives, much less the lives themselves \u2013 is much less contentious than in the 1970s, when many of the photographs were taken. Freedom of sexual expression and openness about gender is one of the only things I envy in the young. Life was more problematic in the early 1970s, when Goldin was in her 20s.</p> <p>How beautiful and proud and out there they are: having fun, partying, just being. Many have died, often too young. Many of these images of her friends appear in her 1994 slideshow The Other Side, recently expanded, and in the photographs on the gallery walls. Songs by Peggy Lee, Marianne Faithfull and others accompany Goldin\u2019s lilting slide show. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/01/from-drag-queens-to-dead-marriages-charles-aznavour-was-far-from-easy-listening\">Charles Aznavour</a> sings What Makes a Man a Man. Seeing many of these images again is like encountering old friends, the dead as well as the living.</p> <p>The composer and performer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/12/mica-levi-of-michachu-and-the-shapes\">Mica Levi</a> provides the soundtrack for Memory Lost, one of two new digital slideshows here. Memory Lost charts Goldin\u2019s life though her addictions. Levi\u2019s trembling, elegiac music is shot through with phone conversations and snippets of gut-wrenching monologue. Innocent Super 8 footage of good times collapses into shots of barking dogs, roads and buildings and blurred passages where memory, it seems, is slurred by dope and booze. There\u2019s a discussion as to whether dope is worse for the memory than coke, and if booze is worst of all. A closeup of a couple from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights#/media/File:The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights_by_Bosch_High_Resolution.jpg\">Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s Garden of Earthly Delights</a> flashes up, and here is a copy of Goldin\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojsc6d8YMuk\">The Ballad of Sexual Depend</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojsc6d8YMuk\">ency</a>, based on the 1986 slide-show that made her name. White lines are chopped out on the cover. Churches and catacombs and details of artworks \u2013 some Goldin\u2019s own paintings \u2013 flash by. A gaudy inflatable paddling pool sits in a field. A man talks about never being held as a child and someone says she couldn\u2019t leave the house, and it must be autumn now, the beautiful turning leaves mocking her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/16/nan-goldin-die-in-v-and-a--sackler-courtyard-opiods\">Artist Nan Goldin leads die-in at V&amp;A over use of Sackler name</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Who knows where the time went.

Memory Lost reworks it all, running past and present into something like a narrative. As unwieldy and sprawling as it is, the work attempts to grapple with it. All her work, I think, is a kind of memoir, an insistent retelling of the same things over and again in different ways \u2013 because that is all that can be done.</p> <p>Another new work, Sirens, is screened right after Memory Lost in the same space. Using found footage, it constantly brings me up short: from a naked body silhouetted on the other side of a glazed door, a metal wire dragged over cobbles, skin picked away from a lesion with a safety pin, people dancing in red light, a field of bodies coming to life. Everything roars. Seeing either of these works once is not enough. Seeing them a second time feels like too much. But like Goldin herself, I cannot turn away.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nan Goldin: Sirens is at <a href=\"https://www.mariangoodman.com/exhibitions/london/\">Marian Goodman Gallery</a>, London, until 11 January 2020.</p></li> </ul>",

The first large show of Goldin\u2019s work in the UK in almost two decades might be accused of raking over old ground. But Goldin often returns to her past, reincorporating older images in new work, adding previously unseen photographs, or presenting mechanical carousel slide-shows in digitised and soundtracked narrative sequences. And so it is here, in an exhibition that takes us from black and white to colour, from snatches of old Super 8 footage to answering-machine conversations, from a fire-eating queen in Manila to a drag bar in Boston. Here is someone crashed in a hotel corridor, stranded on the carpet between closed doors and the remains of room-service dinners. Here are blown-up airplane window sunsets and what, the title tells us ominously, is \u201cthe sky on the twilight of Philippine\u2019s suicide, Winterthur, Switzerland\u201d. This large-scale print gives us a bilious dirty orange sky, a silhouetted chimney, a sodium-yellow streetlight glowing in the dusk. The world heaves in this image, its emotional weather, the uncanny light. Threaded through the exhibition are warm photographs of Goldin\u2019s friends and lovers, the drag queens, cross-dressers, transexuals and third sexers. These days such imagery \u2013 and the celebration of these lives, much less the lives themselves \u2013 is much less contentious than in the 1970s, when many of the photographs were taken. Freedom of sexual expression and openness about gender is one of the only things I envy in the young. Life was more problematic in the early 1970s, when Goldin was in her 20s. How beautiful and proud and out there they are: having fun, partying, just being. Many have died, often too young. Many of these images of her friends appear in her 1994 slideshow The Other Side, recently expanded, and in the photographs on the gallery walls. Songs by Peggy Lee, Marianne Faithfull and others accompany Goldin\u2019s lilting slide show. Charles Aznavour sings What Makes a Man a Man. Seeing many of these images again is like encountering old friends, the dead as well as the living. The composer and performer Mica Levi provides the soundtrack for Memory Lost, one of two new digital slideshows here. Memory Lost charts Goldin\u2019s life though her addictions. Levi\u2019s trembling, elegiac music is shot through with phone conversations and snippets of gut-wrenching monologue. Innocent Super 8 footage of good times collapses into shots of barking dogs, roads and buildings and blurred passages where memory, it seems, is slurred by dope and booze. There\u2019s a discussion as to whether dope is worse for the memory than coke, and if booze is worst of all. A closeup of a couple from Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s Garden of Earthly Delights flashes up, and here is a copy of Goldin\u2019s book, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency, based on the 1986 slide-show that made her name. White lines are chopped out on the cover. Churches and catacombs and details of artworks \u2013 some Goldin\u2019s own paintings \u2013 flash by. A gaudy inflatable paddling pool sits in a field. A man talks about never being held as a child and someone says she couldn\u2019t leave the house, and it must be autumn now, the beautiful turning leaves mocking her. Who knows where the time went. There are pills strewn everywhere. Time wallows and speeds up, Levi\u2019s music going with it, and suddenly \u2013 everything hits you suddenly, as if time\u2019s collapsing \u2013 we come to a sign on a pharmacy door. \u201cWE DO NOT STOCK OXYCONTIN\u201d, it reads. And here\u2019s a corner of a mattress, a hole burned right through it. Goldin\u2019s addiction to the prescription opioid, and her campaign against the Sackler family much of whose arts philanthropy has relied on the profits made from mass pharmaceutical addiction is more than a subplot here. Goldin\u2019s images stand in for memories, with its lapses, repetitions, the mess we leave behind, all mingled with the people who are gone, and the things we cling to. Memory Lost reworks it all, running past and present into something like a narrative. As unwieldy and sprawling as it is, the work attempts to grapple with it. All her work, I think, is a kind of memoir, an insistent retelling of the same things over and again in different ways \u2013 because that is all that can be done. Another new work, Sirens, is screened right after Memory Lost in the same space. Using found footage, it constantly brings me up short: from a naked body silhouetted on the other side of a glazed door, a metal wire dragged over cobbles, skin picked away from a lesion with a safety pin, people dancing in red light, a field of bodies coming to life. Everything roars. Seeing either of these works once is not enough. Seeing them a second time feels like too much. But like Goldin herself, I cannot turn away. Nan Goldin: Sirens is at Marian Goodman Gallery, London, until 11 January 2020.",

Worst of all, he doesn\u2019t even know what to think or what to do right now. He thought he had managed to game the system only to discover that the system had his number all along. All he can do is plod on regardless, drifting ever closer to nothingness.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, South Yorkshire,\u201d he said, trying to sound enthusiastic. Not the best of starts when you happen to be in the East Riding. He then talked a bit about the floods. People had been let down and it was time to deal with the causes not the symptoms. For a moment it seemed as if Farage was making a late bid for the Green vote by talking about climate change. But no. All the flooding was apparently down to EU regulations. Brussels\u2019 revenge on the UK for voting for Brexit had been to flood large areas of Yorkshire.</p> <p>The smile dropped a little as he settled into his familiar routine. Making the same gags and running through the same patter of betrayal was becoming more painful by the day. Because the person who had done most to betray him was himself. Nigel had been undone by Nigel. Hubris, thy name is Nigel. The man who had time and again built himself up as the brilliant campaigner had turned out \u2013 yet again \u2013 to be fairly hopeless at running a general election campaign.</p> <p>He thought he had been calling the shots when he had offered the Tories an electoral pact. The Brexit party would stand aside in Tory-held constituencies, if the Conservatives gave him a clear shot at Labour seats. The Tories had said: \u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201d So the tough negotiator had unilaterally gone ahead and agreed a deal that offered him nothing in return. He had made himself<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/06/consciously-uncoupled-the-joy-of-self-partnership\"> the Emma Watson of British politics</a>. The party leader who had not only managed to self-partner himself but had also somehow contrived to cheat on himself. There\u2019s going to be an extremely messy break-up when Nigel finds out what Nigel has done to Nigel.</p> <p>The longer Farage spoke, the more you could feel the self-confidence drain away. Nothing made sense to him any more and he began to collapse inwards under the weight of his own contradictions. He was telling his supporters not to trust Boris when he had just done his best to make sure Johnson got re-elected as prime minister. Hell, every dummy knew Boris was a fraud but he had fallen for the most basic three-card con.</p> <p>He was telling them that everyone knew what they were voting for in the referendum \u2013 \u201cYou did, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u2013 but had now discovered there were a variety of Brexits on offer. One of which he didn\u2019t want but had in effect endorsed anyway. He was telling them that the Conservatives were on course for an overall majority, so there was next to no point in them voting for the Brexit party in Labour seats because they would be screwed either way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/which-election-videos-are-getting-the-most-attention-online\">Which election videos are getting the most attention online?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It began to sound like a long political suicide note. An admission of futility. He could no longer maintain even the illusion that Brexit was within his hands. Within a week he had gone from leading actor to walk-on understudy. Twenty-five years of campaigning edging towards anonymity. Why was he even still here? The UK was dead to him. Two more weeks of this and he\u2019d only be talking to his rapidly ageing reflection. Time to high-tail it back to the Donald and the US chatshow circuit. The future was bright, the future was orange.</p> <p>The audience shuffled nervously, as if intruding on a private grief. Normally, even a half-throttle Farage speech can generate a standing ovation. Now barely a quarter of the audience could be bothered to stand up and applaud.

All he can do is plod on regardless, drifting ever closer to nothingness. \u201cGood morning, South Yorkshire,\u201d he said, trying to sound enthusiastic. Not the best of starts when you happen to be in the East Riding. He then talked a bit about the floods. People had been let down and it was time to deal with the causes not the symptoms. For a moment it seemed as if Farage was making a late bid for the Green vote by talking about climate change. But no. All the flooding was apparently down to EU regulations. Brussels\u2019 revenge on the UK for voting for Brexit had been to flood large areas of Yorkshire. The smile dropped a little as he settled into his familiar routine. Making the same gags and running through the same patter of betrayal was becoming more painful by the day. Because the person who had done most to betray him was himself. Nigel had been undone by Nigel. Hubris, thy name is Nigel. The man who had time and again built himself up as the brilliant campaigner had turned out \u2013 yet again \u2013 to be fairly hopeless at running a general election campaign. He thought he had been calling the shots when he had offered the Tories an electoral pact. The Brexit party would stand aside in Tory-held constituencies, if the Conservatives gave him a clear shot at Labour seats. The Tories had said: \u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201d So the tough negotiator had unilaterally gone ahead and agreed a deal that offered him nothing in return. He had made himself the Emma Watson of British politics. The party leader who had not only managed to self-partner himself but had also somehow contrived to cheat on himself. There\u2019s going to be an extremely messy break-up when Nigel finds out what Nigel has done to Nigel. The longer Farage spoke, the more you could feel the self-confidence drain away. Nothing made sense to him any more and he began to collapse inwards under the weight of his own contradictions. He was telling his supporters not to trust Boris when he had just done his best to make sure Johnson got re-elected as prime minister. Hell, every dummy knew Boris was a fraud but he had fallen for the most basic three-card con. He was telling them that everyone knew what they were voting for in the referendum \u2013 \u201cYou did, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u2013 but had now discovered there were a variety of Brexits on offer. One of which he didn\u2019t want but had in effect endorsed anyway. He was telling them that the Conservatives were on course for an overall majority, so there was next to no point in them voting for the Brexit party in Labour seats because they would be screwed either way. It began to sound like a long political suicide note. An admission of futility. He could no longer maintain even the illusion that Brexit was within his hands. Within a week he had gone from leading actor to walk-on understudy. Twenty-five years of campaigning edging towards anonymity. Why was he even still here? The UK was dead to him. Two more weeks of this and he\u2019d only be talking to his rapidly ageing reflection. Time to high-tail it back to the Donald and the US chatshow circuit. The future was bright, the future was orange. The audience shuffled nervously, as if intruding on a private grief. Normally, even a half-throttle Farage speech can generate a standing ovation. Now barely a quarter of the audience could be bothered to stand up and applaud. The rest contemplated the eternity of annihilation.

Hey, did I mention I once was fat? That\u2019s almost as funny as Phoebe once being homeless! The 90s were weird.</p> <p><strong>Chandler:</strong> It\u2019s not just a reunion, it\u2019s \u201can unscripted reunion\u201d, a phrase only slightly more ominous than \u201crail replacement bus service\u201d or \u201cuntitled Matthew Perry project\u201d.

Oh, what\u2019s that? A photo of all of us together, capturing a totally natural and spontaneous moment of definitely genuine friendship. Could your Instagram BE any more of a PR job?</p> <p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Hey, it\u2019s not just me, Chandler, OK? Look at Monica, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B4lRJHXjgnT/\" title=\"\">posting photos</a> of the two of you going out for a totally casual lunch together like the BFFs you definitely are. Could you BE any more caught out?</p> <p><strong>Monica:</strong> I just wanted a photo of a nice moment! And also to remind the public that Chandler\u2019s TV career used to consist of more than him <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDtIZZiySgA\" title=\"\">arguing about drug addiction with Peter Hitchens on Newsnight</a>.</p> <p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yeah, one of the writers really needed to SERIOUSLY punch up that script.</p> <p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Hey! Hey! That reminds me of a song I wrote: \u201cNever get into an argument with a Hitchens / You\u2019d be better off banging your head on the floor in the kitchen / Christopher did go on a bit / And Peter! Even! More!\u201d</p> <p><strong>Joey:</strong> That was great, Pheebs!</p> <p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Seriously, is she our charity case? An exchange student from outer space?</p> <p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Ohhhhh wait a minute, have you guys seen this? <em>[Opens copy of a celebrity magazine.

What else does it say?</p> <p><strong>Joey:</strong> Sorry, I can\u2019t read.</p> <p><em>[The gang all smile and shake their heads fondly. Classic Joey!]</em></p> <p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Look, I don\u2019t want to make this all about me. But let\u2019s admit it, it is. Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense if the story was that David Schwimmer had always been in love with Jennifer Aniston. I mean, Ross and Rachel, Poor Jen anyone, hello?</p> <p><strong>Joey:</strong> Yeah, Rachel, I don\u2019t know how to tell you this, but David Schwimmer is married.</p> <p><strong>Monica:</strong> Also, no one actually wants Rachel to end up with Ross. Ross is a monumental douchebag.

Could this BE any more stage-managed?</p> <p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> OK, but look, here\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand, OK? For the past 15 years, every time one of us has given an interview, we\u2019ve been asked about a reunion. And now here we are, giving the people what they want. But they don\u2019t seem, like, I don\u2019t know, happy?</p> <p><em>[The gang all ponder this for a moment. It is perplexing.]</em></p> <p><strong>Ross:</strong> Well, you have to understand, Pheebs, that no TV reunion has ever gone well in the history of time. Back in the Palaeolithic era there was show called This Life, and the awfulness of its return a decade later traumatised an entire generation. Similarly, in the Mesozoic era was a show called Sex and the City, and let\u2019s just say that bringing it back in movie form \u2013 twice \u2013 did not improve on the original. Then, if you really want to go back to the beginning of the universe, there was The Beverly Hillbillies, Gilligan\u2019s Island and Leave It to Beaver, none of which had good reunions.</p> <p><strong>Rachel:</strong> God, Ross, you\u2019re so boring with your science blah blah blah.</p> <p><strong>Ross:</strong> You\u2019re just annoyed because David Schwimmer is married so our agents can\u2019t plant any David\u2019n\u2019Jen stories in the press</p> <p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Just because the show was off the air didn\u2019t mean you were allowed to get married, you know.</p> <p><strong>Ross:</strong> WE WERE ON A BREAK!</p> <p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Could this reunion BE any more predictable?</p> <p><em>END SCENE</em></p> <h2><strong>The Whitney we don\u2019t get to see very often</strong><br></h2> <p>Small break from the usual Lost in Showbiz proceedings here to unironically celebrate a celebrity story. This month, Robyn Crawford \u2013 Whitney Houston\u2019s best friend and long-rumoured girlfriend \u2013 broke her decades-long silence with an upcoming memoir, A Song for You: My Life With Whitney.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0c3d3fd518226683dcddd7cd3314d00309b00482\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c3d3fd518226683dcddd7cd3314d00309b00482/1141_0_3271_3272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robyn Crawford with Whitney Houston\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robyn Crawford (right) with Whitney Houston: a rare paragon of steadiness and common sense.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Robyn Crawford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Let\u2019s get the not exactly astonishing revelation out of the way first: yes, Crawford and Houston were lovers, and Crawford decided to speak about it after Houston\u2019s daughter, Bobbi Kristina, died in 2015. Now, I have sat through a lot of Whitney documentaries \u2013 Kevin Macdonald\u2019s last year, Nick Broomfield\u2019s the year before, both of which can be described with the very technical term \u201cmeh\u201d. Crawford declined to talk to either of them, and has instead given her big interview to Lena Waithe in Oprah Winfrey\u2019s O magazine, <a href=\"https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/books/a29657752/robyn-crawford-lena-waithe-a-song-for-you-interview/\" title=\"\">which is published this week</a>.</p> <p>One doesn\u2019t want to get bogged down in identity politics \u2013 in the Guardian? Heaven forfend! \u2013 but it\u2019s undeniably pleasing that Crawford decided to share her story with a black queer woman, in a magazine published by another black woman, instead of handing it over to two white men. And it\u2019s rather fortunate for Macdonald at least that she didn\u2019t talk to him, given that she scoffs at what is presented as the big revelation in his film, that Houston was sexually abused by a female relative.</p> <p>Instead, Crawford comes across as one of the few people who has written and spoken about Houston who actually knew her and cared about her. Too often, \u201cmy famous friend\u201d memoirs seem like exploitative cash-ins, but Crawford\u2019s feels like a genuine effort to reclaim Houston from the voyeuristic takes, showing that she was more than a tragic druggie, and instead was a woman who loved deeply and made some bad choices. As for Crawford herself, she comes across as a rare paragon of steadiness and common sense and someone Houston was lucky to have known.</p>",

I mean, could this BE any worse of an idea? Rachel: Now wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Are we really doing this? Like, REALLY?! Chandler: Well, I don\u2019t know, Rachel, let\u2019s look at your Instagram \u2013 which you suddenly joined for no reason at all last month. Oh, what\u2019s that? A photo of all of us together, capturing a totally natural and spontaneous moment of definitely genuine friendship. Could your Instagram BE any more of a PR job? Rachel: Hey, it\u2019s not just me, Chandler, OK? Look at Monica, posting photos of the two of you going out for a totally casual lunch together like the BFFs you definitely are. Could you BE any more caught out? Monica: I just wanted a photo of a nice moment! And also to remind the public that Chandler\u2019s TV career used to consist of more than him arguing about drug addiction with Peter Hitchens on Newsnight. Ross: Yeah, one of the writers really needed to SERIOUSLY punch up that script. Phoebe: Hey! Hey! That reminds me of a song I wrote: \u201cNever get into an argument with a Hitchens / You\u2019d be better off banging your head on the floor in the kitchen / Christopher did go on a bit / And Peter! Even! More!\u201d Joey: That was great, Pheebs! Chandler: Seriously, is she our charity case? An exchange student from outer space? Rachel: Ohhhhh wait a minute, have you guys seen this? [Opens copy of a celebrity magazine. All the gang lean over her shoulder to read.] Ross: According to an unnamed source, Matthew Perry has always been in love with Courtney Cox \u2026 Rachel [loud gasp and double take]: Oh my God, just like Chandler and Monica on the show! [Screws up her eyes and starts to talk in a squeaky voice. This is how the Friends cry.] What an amazing coincidence! Phoebe: And it says here he never got over it! What else does it say? Joey: Sorry, I can\u2019t read. [The gang all smile and shake their heads fondly. Classic Joey!] Rachel: Look, I don\u2019t want to make this all about me. But let\u2019s admit it, it is. Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense if the story was that David Schwimmer had always been in love with Jennifer Aniston. I mean, Ross and Rachel, Poor Jen anyone, hello? Joey: Yeah, Rachel, I don\u2019t know how to tell you this, but David Schwimmer is married. Monica: Also, no one actually wants Rachel to end up with Ross. Ross is a monumental douchebag. It\u2019s bad enough you once went out with Vince Vaughan. Ross and Rachel: Hey! [Both pause and think about that.] Ross and Rachel: No, that\u2019s fair. Chandler: Boy, I can\u2019t wait for more of these stories over the next year. Matt LeBlanc and Lisa Kudrow spotted in Pottery Barn buying an Apothecary table. David Schwimmer snapped going out for fajitas. Jennifer Aniston making a capsule line for Ralph Lauren. Could this BE any more stage-managed? Phoebe: OK, but look, here\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand, OK? For the past 15 years, every time one of us has given an interview, we\u2019ve been asked about a reunion. And now here we are, giving the people what they want. But they don\u2019t seem, like, I don\u2019t know, happy? [The gang all ponder this for a moment. It is perplexing.] Ross: Well, you have to understand, Pheebs, that no TV reunion has ever gone well in the history of time. Back in the Palaeolithic era there was show called This Life, and the awfulness of its return a decade later traumatised an entire generation. Similarly, in the Mesozoic era was a show called Sex and the City, and let\u2019s just say that bringing it back in movie form \u2013 twice \u2013 did not improve on the original. Then, if you really want to go back to the beginning of the universe, there was The Beverly Hillbillies, Gilligan\u2019s Island and Leave It to Beaver, none of which had good reunions. Rachel: God, Ross, you\u2019re so boring with your science blah blah blah. Ross: You\u2019re just annoyed because David Schwimmer is married so our agents can\u2019t plant any David\u2019n\u2019Jen stories in the press Rachel: Just because the show was off the air didn\u2019t mean you were allowed to get married, you know. Ross: WE WERE ON A BREAK! Chandler: Could this reunion BE any more predictable? END SCENE The Whitney we don\u2019t get to see very often Small break from the usual Lost in Showbiz proceedings here to unironically celebrate a celebrity story. This month, Robyn Crawford \u2013 Whitney Houston\u2019s best friend and long-rumoured girlfriend \u2013 broke her decades-long silence with an upcoming memoir, A Song for You: My Life With Whitney. Let\u2019s get the not exactly astonishing revelation out of the way first: yes, Crawford and Houston were lovers, and Crawford decided to speak about it after Houston\u2019s daughter, Bobbi Kristina, died in 2015. Now, I have sat through a lot of Whitney documentaries \u2013 Kevin Macdonald\u2019s last year, Nick Broomfield\u2019s the year before, both of which can be described with the very technical term \u201cmeh\u201d. Crawford declined to talk to either of them, and has instead given her big interview to Lena Waithe in Oprah Winfrey\u2019s O magazine, which is published this week. One doesn\u2019t want to get bogged down in identity politics \u2013 in the Guardian? Heaven forfend! \u2013 but it\u2019s undeniably pleasing that Crawford decided to share her story with a black queer woman, in a magazine published by another black woman, instead of handing it over to two white men. And it\u2019s rather fortunate for Macdonald at least that she didn\u2019t talk to him, given that she scoffs at what is presented as the big revelation in his film, that Houston was sexually abused by a female relative. Instead, Crawford comes across as one of the few people who has written and spoken about Houston who actually knew her and cared about her. Too often, \u201cmy famous friend\u201d memoirs seem like exploitative cash-ins, but Crawford\u2019s feels like a genuine effort to reclaim Houston from the voyeuristic takes, showing that she was more than a tragic druggie, and instead was a woman who loved deeply and made some bad choices. As for Crawford herself, she comes across as a rare paragon of steadiness and common sense and someone Houston was lucky to have known.",

      "body": "<p>Do you wanna build a franchise? Maybe Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck didn\u2019t realise this was what they were going to do in creating their sensational Disney animated musical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/05/frozen-review\">Frozen</a> in 2013, with its lethal Broadway-style show tunes written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez and scored by Christopher Beck. It was all about Elsa, the beautiful blond princess with supernatural icy powers, a story based mostly on Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s The Snow Queen, along with the still unacknowledged influence of Frozone from The Incredibles. Now its fiercely anticipated sequel is here.</p> <p>In 2013, parents of young daughters didn\u2019t realise how their every waking moment and all of their disposable income was going to be dominated by Frozen, with Elsa toothbrushes, Elsa hairbrushes, Elsa dolls, Elsa backpacks, Elsa snow globes, Elsa onesies, Elsa lunch boxes, Elsa sequin slippers, all to be assembled at Frozen-themed sleepovers. </p> <p>And for all ages there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/apr/10/frozen-let-it-go-disney-hit-adolescent-lgbt-anthem\">the sensational song, Let It Go</a>, which hit the nerve centres of adults and children alike with the power of crystal meth. Exiled from her homeland, in her magnificent isolation, Elsa realises that she no longer needs to hide her icy superpowers and can use them freely and be herself \u2013 she can let it go. All of us, women and men, gay and straight, after a few glasses of wine can feel the karaoke thrill of that amazing song, which subtextually speaks to grownup themes. It\u2019s Gloria Gaynor\u2019s I Will Survive for a new generation, building to a defiant voice-cracking melodrama on the famous line: \u201cThe cold never bothered me anyway.\u201d Sadly, there have been numberless vulgar spoof versions on YouTube, including Let One Go, a notorious version in praise of farting.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6zndatKpVc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k6zndatKpVc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Part of the strangeness of watching Frozen II is wondering if there will be a specific \u201csequel\u201d to Let It Go, a new number that takes its sentiments forward in some way, and it is simultaneously a mild disappointment and a vague relief that there isn\u2019t, or not exactly, although there are some hummable, catchy tunes. It\u2019s notable that Elsa (voiced again by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/idina-menzel\">Idina Menzel</a>) is still seen fundamentally as a singleton, where it is her devoted sister Anna (voiced again by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/26/the-good-place-actor-kristen-bell-model-marriage-charity-work\">Kristen Bell</a>) who is the one with the romantic pairing, with Kristoff (Jonathan Groff).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/09/dad-who-watched-frozen-50-times-prepares-for-sequel-tom-lamont\">\u2018I must have watched it 50 times\u2019: a Frozen dad prepares for the sequel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sequel takes us some years forward from the end of the first film into the happy ever after, but begins with a flashback to Elsa and Anna\u2019s childhood, in which their parents King Agnarr (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/alfred-molina\">Alfred Molina</a>) and Queen Iduna (voiced by Evan Rachel Wood) tell the little girls at bedtime about the enchanted forest that lies to the north, ruled by four spirits, symbolised by four standing stones: earth, air, fire and water. It is a place with unhappy family associations. Now in the present day, Elsa hears a strange voice calling her from the forest, and she realises that she must journey there to confront and dispel a family secret, naturally with the well-known and well-loved cast of characters by her side: Anna and Kristoff and also Sven the reindeer and the legendary snowman Olaf (Josh Gad).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fa2ec23d5c6d17c680bba347607db0d88344a43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fa2ec23d5c6d17c680bba347607db0d88344a43/458_0_2443_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"That sinking feeling \u2026 Frozen II.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">That sinking feeling \u2026 Frozen II.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Walt Disney Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s nice to see these figures again, but I couldn\u2019t help feeling that there is something a bit underpowered and contrived about the storyline in Frozen II: a matter of jeopardy synthetically created and artificially resolved, obstacles set in place and then surmounted, characters separated and reunited, bad stuff apparently happening and then unhappening. At times, Frozen II almost felt like an extended bonus featurette that could have gone with the Blu-ray edition of the first film. Having said that, it looks and sounds good, with a stirring central song for Elsa entitled Into the Unknown, the curtain-raiser for her encounter with the primeval forces of the forest.</p> <p>Olaf of course is still a scene-stealer, with a great song about how baffled he is by what\u2019s going on, entitled When I Am Older (\u201cThis will all make sense when I am older / Some day I will see that this makes sense / One day when I\u2019m old and wise / I\u2019ll look back and realise that these were all completely normal events \u2026\u201d) He has a very funny scene in which he has to recap the events of the first film in about 10 seconds for people who are not aware of them. There\u2019s also an amusing running gag about Kristoff\u2019s maladroit attempts at a marriage proposal being misunderstood by Anna. It\u2019s an entertaining revival, though a thaw is beginning to set in.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Do you wanna build a franchise? Maybe Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck didn\u2019t realise this was what they were going to do in creating their sensational Disney animated musical Frozen in 2013, with its lethal Broadway-style show tunes written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez and scored by Christopher Beck. It was all about Elsa, the beautiful blond princess with supernatural icy powers, a story based mostly on Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s The Snow Queen, along with the still unacknowledged influence of Frozone from The Incredibles. Now its fiercely anticipated sequel is here. In 2013, parents of young daughters didn\u2019t realise how their every waking moment and all of their disposable income was going to be dominated by Frozen, with Elsa toothbrushes, Elsa hairbrushes, Elsa dolls, Elsa backpacks, Elsa snow globes, Elsa onesies, Elsa lunch boxes, Elsa sequin slippers, all to be assembled at Frozen-themed sleepovers. And for all ages there was the sensational song, Let It Go, which hit the nerve centres of adults and children alike with the power of crystal meth. Exiled from her homeland, in her magnificent isolation, Elsa realises that she no longer needs to hide her icy superpowers and can use them freely and be herself \u2013 she can let it go. All of us, women and men, gay and straight, after a few glasses of wine can feel the karaoke thrill of that amazing song, which subtextually speaks to grownup themes. It\u2019s Gloria Gaynor\u2019s I Will Survive for a new generation, building to a defiant voice-cracking melodrama on the famous line: \u201cThe cold never bothered me anyway.\u201d Sadly, there have been numberless vulgar spoof versions on YouTube, including Let One Go, a notorious version in praise of farting. Part of the strangeness of watching Frozen II is wondering if there will be a specific \u201csequel\u201d to Let It Go, a new number that takes its sentiments forward in some way, and it is simultaneously a mild disappointment and a vague relief that there isn\u2019t, or not exactly, although there are some hummable, catchy tunes. It\u2019s notable that Elsa (voiced again by Idina Menzel) is still seen fundamentally as a singleton, where it is her devoted sister Anna (voiced again by Kristen Bell) who is the one with the romantic pairing, with Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). The sequel takes us some years forward from the end of the first film into the happy ever after, but begins with a flashback to Elsa and Anna\u2019s childhood, in which their parents King Agnarr (Alfred Molina) and Queen Iduna (voiced by Evan Rachel Wood) tell the little girls at bedtime about the enchanted forest that lies to the north, ruled by four spirits, symbolised by four standing stones: earth, air, fire and water. It is a place with unhappy family associations. Now in the present day, Elsa hears a strange voice calling her from the forest, and she realises that she must journey there to confront and dispel a family secret, naturally with the well-known and well-loved cast of characters by her side: Anna and Kristoff and also Sven the reindeer and the legendary snowman Olaf (Josh Gad). It\u2019s nice to see these figures again, but I couldn\u2019t help feeling that there is something a bit underpowered and contrived about the storyline in Frozen II: a matter of jeopardy synthetically created and artificially resolved, obstacles set in place and then surmounted, characters separated and reunited, bad stuff apparently happening and then unhappening. At times, Frozen II almost felt like an extended bonus featurette that could have gone with the Blu-ray edition of the first film. Having said that, it looks and sounds good, with a stirring central song for Elsa entitled Into the Unknown, the curtain-raiser for her encounter with the primeval forces of the forest. Olaf of course is still a scene-stealer, with a great song about how baffled he is by what\u2019s going on, entitled When I Am Older (\u201cThis will all make sense when I am older / Some day I will see that this makes sense / One day when I\u2019m old and wise / I\u2019ll look back and realise that these were all completely normal events \u2026\u201d) He has a very funny scene in which he has to recap the events of the first film in about 10 seconds for people who are not aware of them. There\u2019s also an amusing running gag about Kristoff\u2019s maladroit attempts at a marriage proposal being misunderstood by Anna. It\u2019s an entertaining revival, though a thaw is beginning to set in.",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales police force will review whether body-worn cameras on officers should automatically switch on, Guardian Australia has learned. At July there were 5,217 body-worn cameras being used by NSW police to record incidents, crime scenes and interactions with the public. The standard operating procedures document states officers can choose when to activate them and deactivate them, but outlines when officers should and should not film. For instance, it is recommended the video be switched on at vehicle stops or when first arriving at a crime scene, but officers are told not to leave the cameras running all shift, particularly while on patrol in cars where unrelated or general commentary might be made that could prejudice a case. In August the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, told state parliament the public assumed body-worn cameras would automatically switch on when an officer drew his or her taser or gun, but that was not the case. He said NSW police was considering investing in cameras that would communicate via Bluetooth with guns and tasers so when an officer drew their weapon, every camera within 100m turned on. Fuller also said a major review of the policy of allowing officers to decide when the video recording was switched on or off would begin next year. \u201cThese reviews are intended to ensure we are providing the best possible service to the community by taking advantage of available technology,\u201d it said. The use of body-worn police cameras has been in the spotlight since an officer at protests for the mining conference in Melbourne earlier this month put a sticker with \u201cEAD [eat a dick] hippy\u201d on his camera. The officer in question is facing disciplinary action, but it had been reported the sticker did not cover the camera\u2019s lens. The Age subsequently reported on Monday that the guidelines reviewed recently by Victoria police say officers have discretion over when they can switch the cameras on and off. However, like NSW, this is relatively common policy owing to the relatively recent rollout of the technology across the state and territory police forces. Aside from NSW\u2019s manual policy, in the ACT \u2013 which only recently started rolling out just under 400 body-worn cameras \u2013 the cameras activate when a weapon is drawn, and recently policy was changed to allow officers to manually switch on the camera. During a trial in Western Australia, it was up to police to decide when to turn the camera on, but as it now deploys about 4,200 cameras, they will automatically turn on when an officer draws their gun, and officers will be required to switch on their cameras when attending domestic violence complaints or physical or hostile situations. Queensland police policy requires officers to record before and during the exercising of a police power or applying the use of force, unless it was impractical. In July it announced the number of cameras would expand from 2,100 to 7,700. In the Northern Territory all frontline officers have body-worn cameras, and must be swiched on before and during any encounter with the public where the officer utilises a police power, unless impractical. NT police confirmed that the officer charged with murder over the shooting of 19-year-old Indigenous man Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu had his camera switched on at the time of the alleged murder. At last report, in late 2018, there were more than 200 body-worn cameras in use across Tasmania. Officers were required to activate the camera before and during any situation where an officer exercises police power \u201cunless there is a genuine reason not to do so\u201d. South Australia has body-worn cameras for all of its frontline officers, and they are required to film interactions with the public. Police forces across Australian generally speak positively about the use of body-worn cameras, saying it has an effect on the behaviour of members of the public when they know they are being filmed. In its annual report last year NT police said that while complaints made about officer behaviour were up, it was expected that footage would lead to a drop in the number of cases investigated by the ombudsman. But in the states where filming was not mandatory, there was concern about what NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge told Fuller was \u201cone-sided accountability\u201d, where the video protected officers more than the public. Fuller said in August he wanted officers to use it more. \u201cI want police to use it more and we are changing our policy to make sure that is the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether or not it sits perfectly with the Mr Shoebridge\u2019s sort of position on it I do not know, but we are moving much closer to policy that makes it, not mandatory \u2013 I do not want to use that term \u2013 but certainly much more proactive in using it.\u201d A 2017 Australian Institute of Criminology study of police detainees on their attitudes to body-worn cameras found 80% thought they were a good idea because they provided a more accurate and complete version of events. But some were concerned the ability for police officers to turn them on and off could threaten any increased accountability.",

Yes the spaces are beautiful and the design innovative, but there\u2019s a curdle in the architectural cream. The residences, which range from 22 to 40 square meters in size, are a curious mix of aspirational and off-putting. Part of you wants to live in these dreamy matchboxes, another wonders how anyone could.</p> <p>Never Too Small began as a pet project for director and design fan Colin Chee, a way to engage with the architects he admired. It only took four episodes to realise he was on to something. With views growing daily, his employer \u2013 Melbourne-based production company <a href=\"https://www.newmac.co/\">NewMac</a> \u2013 encouraged him to develop the series. Two years later the channel has drawn a huge following, boasting over 700,000 subscribers, with videos regularly bringing in millions of views.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daL7TkzyW7k\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/daL7TkzyW7k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>A popular episode of Never Too Small.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The episodes are as spare and exacting as the designs they celebrate. Chee spends half an hour with the architects \u2013 speaking with them and being shown the spaces \u2013 then cuts the interviews into clips of five minutes or less. Sometimes it takes him two days to select the perfect piece of background music.</p> <p>He has featured homes in Australia, Hong Kong and London (with more European profiles in the works). The subjects are largely young inner-city professionals without children. Which hints at Never Too Small\u2019<em>s </em>appeal. There\u2019s a comfort in seeing people managing the mythical task of finding affordable, beautiful homes in central locations. The series suggests maybe you can have the life you want \u2013 it just might be on a smaller scale than you imagined.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of people want to live in urban areas ... a way to make that work financially is to live in a much smaller space</p> <footer> <cite>Colin Chee</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Chee began the series after moving into a 40 sq m studio in Melbourne\u2019s CBD. Despite growing up in a five-bedroom home in Malaysia, he found micro-living suited his lifestyle and made him feel more connected to the city. \u201cThe way I think of it is the supermarket across the street is my pantry,\u201d he laughs. He\u2019s not alone in prioritising location over size. Architect and urban designer Katherine Sundermann reflects that, \u201cThere has been a return to the city, a lot of people want to live in urban areas ... a way to make that work financially is to live in a much smaller space.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dbb2611a085b50ef474773dde881421bff56ecd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbb2611a085b50ef474773dde881421bff56ecd6/0_0_1280_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Never too Small episode thumbnail\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Micro-living is appealing to those who want to live in central city locations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin Chee/New Mac</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Money isn\u2019t the only concern. Since many Australians have spent time living overseas in cities like New York and Tokyo, Sundermann observes that by the time they come home they may have discovered smaller apartments \u201ccan be a really high-quality experience and a great way to live.\u201d This chimes with Chee. Before downsizing he was already reconsidering his relationships to space and possessions. Like many of us he found himself wanting to own less, consume more thoughtfully and be less controlled by debt.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a growing focus on the environmental benefits of micro-homes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/dec/28/micro-apartments-urban-housing-ollie\">Smaller-living advocates</a> point out the lifestyle is inherently greener. As Sundermann explains: \u201cThe amount of energy and water you\u2019re using (in comparison to living in a larger home) aren\u2019t insignificant. Especially if you have a well-designed new apartment. You might not even need to turn on your heater in winter, compared to living in a detached weatherboard in the suburbs where your energy costs can be very high.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/aug/25/tiny-houses-micro-living-urban-cities-population-newyork-hongkong-tokyo\">Are tiny houses and micro-apartments the future of urban homes?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The homes in Never Too Small are aspirational, but most tiny apartments aren\u2019t a conscious choice of the young, rich and stylish.

Recent builds include apartments that are<a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2140620/regulate-flat-size-hong-kong-sake-our-mental-health\"> smaller than standard prison cells</a>. Despite the insistence that smaller living is a way for more people to become part of the property market, they\u2019ve done little to impact housing affordability. In 2016 a 19.4 sq m apartment in Pok Fu Lam set a city record for micro-apartments and made international headlines when it<a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2140620/regulate-flat-size-hong-kong-sake-our-mental-health\"> sold for over US$1m </a> (AU$1.4m).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/oct/14/tiny-house-holiday-can-a-family-of-four-fit-in-a-15-squaremetre-space\">Tiny house holiday: can a family of four fit in a 15-square-metre space?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Conscious of these realities, Melbourne and Sydney have introduced<a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/new-apartment-standards-for-windows-ceiling-heights-but-not-floor-size-20160813-gqropx.html\"> reforms </a>to dictate minimal dwelling sizes and ensure the liveability of smaller spaces. In 2016, Victorian planning minister Richard Wynne explained the government was \u201cplugging the hole in the planning rules which allowed dog boxes to be built, because we want future apartments to be constructed for long-term living\u201d. The regulations came in the wake of a 2015 report by City of Melbourne planner Leanne Hodyl that detailed how \u201cweak, ineffective or nonexistent\u201d regulation had created an environment where developers went largely unchecked, and apartment building in Melbourne had exceeded maximum densities allowed in Hong Kong, New York and Tokyo.</p> <p>These conversations exist against a backdrop where many are beginning to interrogate how urban Australian living will evolve in the next few decades.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s hard to explain the exact appeal of Never Too Small. The YouTube series takes viewers on meditative tours of tiny homes from across the world. Yes the spaces are beautiful and the design innovative, but there\u2019s a curdle in the architectural cream. The residences, which range from 22 to 40 square meters in size, are a curious mix of aspirational and off-putting. Part of you wants to live in these dreamy matchboxes, another wonders how anyone could. Never Too Small began as a pet project for director and design fan Colin Chee, a way to engage with the architects he admired. It only took four episodes to realise he was on to something. With views growing daily, his employer \u2013 Melbourne-based production company NewMac \u2013 encouraged him to develop the series. Two years later the channel has drawn a huge following, boasting over 700,000 subscribers, with videos regularly bringing in millions of views. The episodes are as spare and exacting as the designs they celebrate. Chee spends half an hour with the architects \u2013 speaking with them and being shown the spaces \u2013 then cuts the interviews into clips of five minutes or less. Sometimes it takes him two days to select the perfect piece of background music. He has featured homes in Australia, Hong Kong and London (with more European profiles in the works). The subjects are largely young inner-city professionals without children. Which hints at Never Too Small\u2019s appeal. There\u2019s a comfort in seeing people managing the mythical task of finding affordable, beautiful homes in central locations. The series suggests maybe you can have the life you want \u2013 it just might be on a smaller scale than you imagined. Chee began the series after moving into a 40 sq m studio in Melbourne\u2019s CBD. Despite growing up in a five-bedroom home in Malaysia, he found micro-living suited his lifestyle and made him feel more connected to the city. \u201cThe way I think of it is the supermarket across the street is my pantry,\u201d he laughs. He\u2019s not alone in prioritising location over size. Architect and urban designer Katherine Sundermann reflects that, \u201cThere has been a return to the city, a lot of people want to live in urban areas ... a way to make that work financially is to live in a much smaller space.\u201d Money isn\u2019t the only concern. Since many Australians have spent time living overseas in cities like New York and Tokyo, Sundermann observes that by the time they come home they may have discovered smaller apartments \u201ccan be a really high-quality experience and a great way to live.\u201d This chimes with Chee. Before downsizing he was already reconsidering his relationships to space and possessions. Like many of us he found himself wanting to own less, consume more thoughtfully and be less controlled by debt. There\u2019s also a growing focus on the environmental benefits of micro-homes. Smaller-living advocates point out the lifestyle is inherently greener. As Sundermann explains: \u201cThe amount of energy and water you\u2019re using (in comparison to living in a larger home) aren\u2019t insignificant. Especially if you have a well-designed new apartment. You might not even need to turn on your heater in winter, compared to living in a detached weatherboard in the suburbs where your energy costs can be very high.\u201d The homes in Never Too Small are aspirational, but most tiny apartments aren\u2019t a conscious choice of the young, rich and stylish. Scrolling through the comments below Chee\u2019s videos, you quickly realise they rub many the wrong way. Viewers point out that these homes are only available to the wealthy, where many first-homebuyers and young people are more likely to be stuck with poorly designed and overpriced \u201cdog box\u201d apartments. The majority of Never Too Small\u2019s views are from the US, Germany, UK and Canada, where these designs still feel like a novelty. The channel is notably less popular in Asia. Local commenters on tours of Hong Kong residences don\u2019t deplore the lifestyle choice \u2013 they marvel that by their standards these \u201cmicro-apartments\u201d are quite large. Looking to Hong Kong offers a glimpse at the possible future of this trend. There micro-apartments are nothing new; reporting on the increasingly tiny new developments has become something of an observer sport. Recent builds include apartments that are smaller than standard prison cells. Despite the insistence that smaller living is a way for more people to become part of the property market, they\u2019ve done little to impact housing affordability. In 2016 a 19.4 sq m apartment in Pok Fu Lam set a city record for micro-apartments and made international headlines when it sold for over US$1m (AU$1.4m). Conscious of these realities, Melbourne and Sydney have introduced reforms to dictate minimal dwelling sizes and ensure the liveability of smaller spaces. In 2016, Victorian planning minister Richard Wynne explained the government was \u201cplugging the hole in the planning rules which allowed dog boxes to be built, because we want future apartments to be constructed for long-term living\u201d. The regulations came in the wake of a 2015 report by City of Melbourne planner Leanne Hodyl that detailed how \u201cweak, ineffective or nonexistent\u201d regulation had created an environment where developers went largely unchecked, and apartment building in Melbourne had exceeded maximum densities allowed in Hong Kong, New York and Tokyo. These conversations exist against a backdrop where many are beginning to interrogate how urban Australian living will evolve in the next few decades. Australian houses are the biggest in the world, but that could change as a building boom transforms our largest cities. Between 2014 and 2015, apartment-building activity in Victoria grew by 22% as the numbers of apartments caught up to the number of houses being built. Melbourne is predicted to become Australia\u2019s largest city by 2037, with the population hitting 8 million. This growth means Melbourne residents may need to get used to living in smaller spaces and build a city that accommodates them. Chee is optimistic that through regulation, design and city planning, a future populated by micro-apartments needn\u2019t evoke the crowded homes of Hong Kong. In an email after our chat he stresses that, \u201cInstead [of] limiting the apartment size ... we should put an emphasis on the design and quality ... If we have good-designed dwellings for everyone, it also creates opportunities for a better community.\u201d Sundermann agrees, although concedes that all housing has drawbacks: \u201cThere\u2019s something about living in a detached house in the suburbs that can actually be quite isolating.\u201d She argues there\u2019s a middle ground between sprawling, lonely suburbs and extreme micro-living. This is the \u201cmissing middle\u201d. \u201cAt the moment we have the very high towers in the centre with the little one-bedroom apartments, and then we have the suburban three-to-four-bedroom homes. But we\u2019re missing some nice, modest, six-to-seven-storey apartments in well-serviced inner suburbs.\u201d She\u2019s interested in programs that are looking to consolidate existing suburban homes to build moderate new apartments, with a focus on shared gardens and spaces, natural light and a variety of apartment types. She points to more recent developments such as Nightingale Housing and Assemble Communities as examples of how that might work. While the thought of redesigning our cities, lives and homes is daunting, our exploding population means major changes are inevitable. And if Never Too Small\u2019s ever-growing views are anything to go by, we might be more drawn to a micro-living future than we admit.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 3pm at a strip show and the MC, a man with the energy of four breakfast radio DJs, says \u201cMelbourne make some noise.\u201d \u201cYay, yay!\u201d we reply. Our noise is pitiful and lacking energy, like a barely concealed fake orgasm. A handful of us are pressed against a barrier, clapping a woman who just stuffed a three-foot (inflated) balloon down her throat. It just disappeared down her gullet and is now presumably entangled in her lower intestines like one of those seabirds that has swallowed a plastic bag. The MC comes back on. He\u2019s pumped but also perplexed. \u201cHow the fuck did that happen?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s 3pm on a weekday, and you\u2019re here!\u201d he says. It\u2019s an obvious fact, but one that has the effect of casting us in a seedy light, as if attending the opening afternoon of Sexpo on a work day is an epic thirsty move. \u201cIn a couple of hours things will heat up!\u201d he promises, bounding across the stage. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the traditional owners of the land, the Boon Wurrung and Wurundjeri peoples of the Kulin nation! And the sex workers! I\u2019d like to acknowledge the sex workers past and present!\u201d There is a small cheer for his very cool BDE, but we\u2019re already drifting back to the stalls \u2013 where the real modus operandi of Sexpo takes place \u2013 buying STUFF! Sexpo, a health, sexuality and lifestyle exhibition, first started in Melbourne in 1996 and pretty much everyone in Australia has been there at one time, except me. So on Friday, I take the tram from the Guardian office to the Melbourne Convention Centre to find out what makes the event so eternally popular. Sexpo sits at the intersection of the sex toy industrial complex, the milder end of the adult entertainment industry (at least the shows were fairly mild at 3pm in the afternoon) and a sort of Royal Easter Show for adults where you purchase sex toys, lingerie and meet and greets with your favourite adult stars. Most people visiting Sexpo are in couples or with groups of friends and around half the attendees are women. After the 3pm show, I amble around the perimeter of the large, unsexy shed. Somewhat appropriately, Bon Jovi\u2019s You Give Love a Bad Name blares. There\u2019s a food court and an \u201cexotic filled candy and liquorice\u201d stand. There\u2019s a stall selling a thing called \u201cboobie pillows\u201d which don\u2019t really look like boobs, unless the boobs had been flattened in a sandwich press and dyed pink. There are gimp masks. There\u2019s a booth where you can get tattoos. There\u2019s a big sign for lube \u2013 \u201cthe unsung hero of sex\u201d. There\u2019s a stall selling these unsung heroes, in flavours of salted caramel and strawberry shortcake. There are gigantic dildos that flash and spin like the lights on an emergency services vehicle. There\u2019s a plus-size lingerie stall and a giant throne made of dicks called Game of Bones. Couples lovingly purchase riding crops together. An adult entertainment star exits the toilets and a couple eating in the food court stops him as he\u2019s shaking his hands dry and shyly ask for a selfie. Less \u201ccute\u201d and Instagrammable is a strange rubber mat in which is built an anatomically correct-looking vagina \u2013 but also unfortunately resembles an autopsy specimen, like someone has cut a section of skin and is displaying it flat, under the brutal halogen lights. And there\u2019s a sex doll, slouched in the corner of one stall, looking like she\u2019s had too much to drink at a party, sinking like she\u2019s going to slide on to the ground. The urge to place her upright, give her some dignity \u2013 and some underwear \u2013 is strong. But after a lap of the stalls it\u2019s apparent that the main reason for Sexpo existing is for you to buy stuff. The sell is HARD. After taking in the products, I feel a bit weary so I decide to lie down on a vibrating bed on the outskirts of the pavilion. The lady even lets me keep my shoes on. Mmmm, the bed \u2013 which is not flat but undulating, like sleeping on a gentle wave \u2013 feels good. The vibration is low. I feel myself drop into a deeper state of relaxation. The lady asks me my name. I panic and make something up, I don\u2019t know why. She has the controls and she switches something on and suddenly I feel a stronger charge run all through me, even through my shoes. She\u2019s calling me Barb and telling me that if I toss and turn at night, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve got the wrong bed, that all my life I\u2019ve been sleeping in the wrong bed, because it\u2019s not this bed. Where do I live? She can have the bed delivered for free. I could be sleeping on it this weekend! (Or since this is Sexpo, I could be fucking on it this weekend.) She\u2019ll do a deal, a good deal for cash, hundreds of dollars off. She calls a man over and confirms the discount and delivery time. The bed is as good as sold. Only $7,000! I can pay in instalments. I can qualify for Afterpay. In this prone position it\u2019s hard to get up. The bed sales people are looming over me and calling me Barb. I must get off this bed and walk away, but I can\u2019t. The combination of the vibration and the angle of my legs and head, and lack of core strength conspire to sort of lock me in. It\u2019s like sinking into a giant vulva. I feel strangely vulnerable. The only way to get off is to roll off the bed, on to the ground. While this has been happening, I have been on display. People circling the shed are stopping to look at me as I shift from a pleasurable to a panicked state. Why am I here? Existential dread passes through me like a vibration from the bed. The nice people are calling me Barb. I explain I can\u2019t make this purchase without my (pretend) boyfriend agreeing. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s coming to Sexpo tomorrow.\u201d To give her credit, the salesperson doesn\u2019t judge what must be the only couple in history to go to Sexpo separately. I make my excuses and leave, escaping into a room of mostly men. I stand down the back while a woman tells us that men fake orgasms, and more often than we think. They are tired! They are stressed! They just want to lie prone on a gently vibrating bed and watch Netflix! The men in the audience are nodding. The vibe is low, like the last lecture of the day at uni. It\u2019s 4pm. Time for the next show. There are more people now, the space is filling up. Groups of men with access passes get in position close to the stage. The MC \u2013 who is truly excellent \u2013 is hyping us up for Lady Fur, the next act. He gives a time check. \u201cIt\u2019s 4pm. On a weekday. And if you\u2019re here already, it means you\u2019re insanely horny!\u201d (Small cheers.) \u201cAnyone here jacked off to Burning Angel? She\u2019s just over there!\u201d I have not jacked off to Burning Angel, so stay where I am. Lady Fur is a pole dancer. Some genetically sexy music starts, the lights turn down low (which is not very impactful in the daylight) and Lady Fur comes prancing on to the stage in thigh-high stiletto boots. Lady Fur is a sexy performer with a very hairy chest and massive beard, wearing a flowing chiffon dress. All the groups of men with access passes \u2013 literally there is no other word for it \u2013 flee. I doubt men have moved so swiftly since Lot fled Sodom. ( \u201cFlee for your lives! Don\u2019t look back, and don\u2019t stop anywhere in the plain!\u201d) Anyway, it is very funny. They should have stayed because Lady Fur is very good. In a single leap Lady Fur gets to the top of the pole, wearing uncomfortable shoes! Everybody cheers. People who had been to Sexpo had various opinions on it. They told me it was boring, or bogan, or suburban, or confronting, or sexy or entertaining, but no one said it was funny. But they should have. It\u2019s completely hilarious. \u2022 Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "body": "<p>A perfectly manicured lawn lines either side of the eight-lane highway leading into the Gulf city of Sharjah. Punctuated by rows of palm trees and pink-blossomed flowerbeds, it is a lush, implausible vision, sustained by a constant mist of sprinklers beneath the scorching sun. Beyond the green ribbon, expansive gated villas sprout from the sand, giving way to mirrored glass towers, leading to a reconstructed \u201cold town\u201d, where air conditioning is pumped into the alleys of an open-air souk.</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to see how the United Arab Emirates, of which Sharjah is the third largest city-state after Abu Dhabi and Dubai, is one of the highest <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?display=graph--%3E&amp;locations=AE&amp;most_recent_value_desc=true\">emitters of carbon dioxide</a> and <a href=\"https://www.export.gov/article?id=United-Arab-Emirates-Water\">consumers of water per capita in the world</a>. It is a place where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/feb/13/not-end-the-world-return-dubai-ultimate-folly\">souped-up SUVs roar from man-made islands</a> to malls with indoor ski slopes, where water is flushed by the gallon into ornamental gardens, where energy is guzzled with end-of-the-world glee, deaf to the pleas of Greta Thunberg. But before you start sneering, this petroleum-fuelled, water-hungry lifestyle is mostly the doing of British and American conglomerates, the result of an Anglo-centric idea of a city imposed on a desert climate that could never sustain it.</p> <p>Post-colonial legacies, climate justice and water equity are just some of the testy topics that feature in the inaugural <a href=\"https://www.sharjaharchitecture.org/\">Sharjah Architecture Triennial</a>, a three-month extravaganza of exhibitions and events that opened this week. Billed as \u201can archipelago of struggles\u201d, the programme has very little to do with buildings, and a lot to do with the forces shaping our planet. It draws on the work of architects, engineers, activists, performers, choreographers, scientists, musicians and anthropologists to present a portrait of climate catastrophe, indigenous land claims, illegal occupation and more \u2013 all under the momentous title Rights of Future Generations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"384b84e6b7b4fc2762d9d02674230b4f3ba7ce4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/384b84e6b7b4fc2762d9d02674230b4f3ba7ce4b/0_233_5687_3412/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monsoon architecture \u2026 Marina Tabassum\u2019s house designs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monsoon architecture \u2026 Marina Tabassum\u2019s house designs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Antoine Espinasseau</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI have a very expansive definition of architecture,\u201d says curator Adrian Lahoud, an Australian of Lebanese descent who is dean of architecture at the Royal College of Art in London. He\u2019s not wrong. In the courtyard of a former high school, taken over as one of the main venues, Balinese gamelan musicians perform next to a display about the politics of satellites and an installation about Palestinians being maimed in Gaza. Nearby there are exhibits about the destruction of sacred Ethiopian forests, the meaning of UN development videos and the geography of the call to prayer in Mecca. <br><br>This aversion to buildings is shared by many recent architecture biennials and triennials, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/14/chicago-architecture-biennial-review\">Chicago </a>to <a href=\"http://oslotriennale.no/en/\">Oslo</a>. Staking a claim for architecture\u2019s social conscience in a time of global crisis, these events raise worthy issues, but the question is whether such themes translate into good exhibitions, or feel more like a series of PhD proposals stuck on the wall.</p> <p>The projects on show in Sharjah tread this fine line with mixed results: some important topics are clouded by opaque theoretical posturing, while others are executed with visceral clarity. One of the most compelling contributions comes from London-based duo <a href=\"http://www.cooking-sections.com/\">Cooking Sections</a>, who have constructed a series of rocky bowls in the school\u2019s forecourt, sunken into the sandy landscape, in which desert plant species have been planted.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Water consumption is set to double by 2030, with half of it used on irrigation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Looking like mini-volcano craters, these rubble-lined depressions are designed to enable irrigation without water. Based on ancient techniques of cultivation found in places such as Lanzarote and Algeria, the bowls create little micro-climates for the plants, shielding them from wind and collecting condensation on the underside of the rocks.</p> <p>\u201cThe nurseries here in the UAE don\u2019t grow desert plants, because they\u2019re not seen as ornamental,\u201d says Alon Schwabe, one half of the duo. \u201cWe want to propose an alternative model for non-irrigated urban gardens in Sharjah and other arid climates, bringing the desert back into the city.\u201d</p> <p>Working with engineers AKTII, Cooking Sections have equipped their rocky craters with sensors that record factors like leaf moisture, heat radiation and wind speed, displayed on a nearby screen that will monitor the performance of the garden until the next triennial. It is a beautiful, climate-appropriate creation that deserves to be noticed in a place addicted to western ideals of grassy verges and exotic shrubbery \u2013 where water consumption is set to double by 2030, half of it used on irrigation.</p> <p>The problem of water, both its scarcity and overabundance, is a theme of the triennial. Bangladeshi architect <a href=\"https://www.iconeye.com/architecture/features/item/13082-marina-tabassum-s-architecture-of-resistance\">Marina Tabassum</a> presents a fascinating study of the delta region in the south of her country where three rivers collide to create a constantly changing landscape. Satellite images show how swaths of sandy soil appear and disappear from one season to the next, seeing families dispossessed of their land overnight, sometimes waiting generations for it to re-emerge from the waters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"608bbf715a16b8048c9a0981638e89e0f2a9b26d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/608bbf715a16b8048c9a0981638e89e0f2a9b26d/0_0_5734_3441/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Atacama Lines by Alonso Barros, Gonzalo Pimentel, Juan Gili, and Mauricio Hidalgo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enigmatic symbols \u2026 The Atacama Lines by Alonso Barros, Gonzalo Pimentel, Juan Gili, and Mauricio Hidalgo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antoine Espinasseau</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cUnder British rule, land ownership was formalised with plots drawn on a map,\u201d says Tabassum. \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018dry culture\u2019 idea imposed on a \u2018wet culture\u2019: when the monsoons come, you have a piece of paper, but no land. So families hold on to their papers for years, waiting for the land to come back.\u201d Her research is housed in a series of three charming little timber-framed houses with ornamental rooftops, available to buy off-the-peg in Bangladesh, designed to be disassembled and moved on a truck at a moment\u2019s notice. </p> <p>While the Bengali delta-dwellers have too much water, the Quechua people in the Atacama desert of northern Chile don\u2019t have enough. The battle for access to water is at the forefront of their struggle against global mining conglomerates, whose extractions have seen some local water supplies drop tenfold over the last decade. Stunning backlit aerial photographs shine out from a darkened room, along with a projection-mapped model, depicting ancient geoglyphs carved into the sandy mountainous landscape of the Atacama desert. These primitive works of land art \u2013 depicting human figures, animals and enigmatic symbols \u2013 were created by nomadic travelling tribes, but they\u2019re now being used <a href=\"https://artreview.com/home/online_2019_sharjah_triennial_3_alonso_barros_and_gonzalo_pimentel/\">as a powerful legal tool by the Quechua</a> to stake their claim to the land.</p> <p>\u201cThe mining companies have devoured our resources and poisoned our water,\u201d says Mauricio Hidalgo, president of the indigenous community of Huatacondo in Tarapac\u00e1, who travelled to Sharjah for the triennial. \u201cBut the geoglyphs have given us a voice and a spiritual force that we never imagined we could have. We are regaining our dignity and autonomy because of this public art that our forefathers have bequeathed us.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The mining companies respect us today more than ever</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Working with lawyer and anthropologist Alonso Barros, the community has mobilised the ancient geoglyphs, which now have the status of protected national monuments, in an effort to protect their ancestral lands from further mineral extraction. \u201cThe mining companies respect us today more than ever,\u201d says Hidalgo. Strangely none of this is mentioned in the exhibit itself, which simply focuses on the archaeological beauty of the geoglyphs, with no reference to how they are being weaponised in the fight for territorial justice.</p> <p>The role of art in land-rights struggles is more directly conveyed in another exhibit across town at the Sharjah Art Foundation, where the aboriginal Ngurrara people of Western Australia have brought their <a href=\"https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/art/why-the-huge-aboriginal-painting-coming-to-sharjah-this-november-is-a-must-see-1.892881\">stunning Ngurrara Canvas</a>. In a lengthy legal battle in the 90s, the indigenous Australian community had to provide proof of their connection to the area, including the continued existence of laws and customs, and their routes across the land.</p> <p>Feeling that their history couldn\u2019t be expressed in English, they decided to paint their right to the territory instead. The resulting 80sq m painting, made over a fortnight by 40 artists, is a dizzying patchwork quilt of signs and symbols that represent watering holes, campfires, and places of birth and burial, in a kaleidoscopic collage of ritual and memory. (The visual testimony worked: in 2007, the claim was successfully determined in favour of the Ngurrara.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1496d6235bcf97976909751c9fd1a76fc309fc8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1496d6235bcf97976909751c9fd1a76fc309fc8a/0_368_7087_4252/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Painted land rights \u2026 the Ngurrara Canvas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Painted land rights \u2026 the Ngurrara Canvas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sharjah Architecture Triennial</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The elephant in the room, looming over all of these powerful explorations of global rights crusades, is the UAE itself. Last year, the country\u2019s most well-known human-rights activist was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/14/ahmed-mansoor-must-be-freed-now-his-jailing-is-an-attack-on-human-rights\">jailed for 10 years over some tweets</a>, while arbitrary detention of foreign nationals was frequently reported. The authorities continued to deny nationality to thousands of people born in the country, in effect <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/united-arab-emirates\">rendering them stateless</a>. Despite recent reforms, migrant construction workers face continued exploitation. Lahoud says workers\u2019 housing conditions formed part of the triennial team\u2019s initial research, but that is mysteriously absent from the show.</p> <p>It also feels like a missed opportunity to engage with some of the urgent architectural and urban issues facing Sharjah itself. Much of the emirate\u2019s fine modernist heritage from the 1970s and 80s is under threat of demolition, while the erection of air-conditioned glass behemoths, like the new <a href=\"http://sharjahmall.ae/\">Sharjah Mall</a> and <a href=\"https://gulfnews.com/business/property/sharjah-shores-up-waterfront-housing-segment-1.62147847\">Waterfront City complex</a>, continues apace.</p> <p>Under <a href=\"https://frieze.com/article/profile-hoor-al-qasimi\">Sheikha Hoor a</a><a href=\"https://frieze.com/article/profile-hoor-al-qasimi\">l-Qasimi</a>, daughter of the ruler and the impressive force behind the <a href=\"http://www.sharjahart.org/\">Sharjah Art Foundation</a>, some progress has been made. The triennial\u2019s venues, including the school and a former vegetable market, have been safeguarded, adding to a dozen vacant buildings of the era that al-Qasimi has managed to <a href=\"https://www.thenational.ae/uae/sheikha-hoor-al-qasimi-on-flying-saucers-nostalgia-and-building-on-sharjah-s-past-1.181690\">preserve as art and community spaces</a>. Another triennial project, by Italian studio <a href=\"http://www.dogma.name/\">Dogma</a>, has seen a vacant lot transformed into a public space, which, it\u2019s hoped, will become permanent.</p> <p>Lahoud has set a powerful political precedent for this new institution, but future editions must have the confidence to engage further with the forces shaping the cities of the UAE, and tackle the country\u2019s rapacious urban development \u2013 before it\u2019s too late.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A perfectly manicured lawn lines either side of the eight-lane highway leading into the Gulf city of Sharjah. Punctuated by rows of palm trees and pink-blossomed flowerbeds, it is a lush, implausible vision, sustained by a constant mist of sprinklers beneath the scorching sun. Beyond the green ribbon, expansive gated villas sprout from the sand, giving way to mirrored glass towers, leading to a reconstructed \u201cold town\u201d, where air conditioning is pumped into the alleys of an open-air souk. It\u2019s not hard to see how the United Arab Emirates, of which Sharjah is the third largest city-state after Abu Dhabi and Dubai, is one of the highest emitters of carbon dioxide and consumers of water per capita in the world. It is a place where souped-up SUVs roar from man-made islands to malls with indoor ski slopes, where water is flushed by the gallon into ornamental gardens, where energy is guzzled with end-of-the-world glee, deaf to the pleas of Greta Thunberg. But before you start sneering, this petroleum-fuelled, water-hungry lifestyle is mostly the doing of British and American conglomerates, the result of an Anglo-centric idea of a city imposed on a desert climate that could never sustain it. Post-colonial legacies, climate justice and water equity are just some of the testy topics that feature in the inaugural Sharjah Architecture Triennial, a three-month extravaganza of exhibitions and events that opened this week. Billed as \u201can archipelago of struggles\u201d, the programme has very little to do with buildings, and a lot to do with the forces shaping our planet. It draws on the work of architects, engineers, activists, performers, choreographers, scientists, musicians and anthropologists to present a portrait of climate catastrophe, indigenous land claims, illegal occupation and more \u2013 all under the momentous title Rights of Future Generations. \u201cI have a very expansive definition of architecture,\u201d says curator Adrian Lahoud, an Australian of Lebanese descent who is dean of architecture at the Royal College of Art in London. He\u2019s not wrong. In the courtyard of a former high school, taken over as one of the main venues, Balinese gamelan musicians perform next to a display about the politics of satellites and an installation about Palestinians being maimed in Gaza. Nearby there are exhibits about the destruction of sacred Ethiopian forests, the meaning of UN development videos and the geography of the call to prayer in Mecca. This aversion to buildings is shared by many recent architecture biennials and triennials, from Chicago to Oslo. Staking a claim for architecture\u2019s social conscience in a time of global crisis, these events raise worthy issues, but the question is whether such themes translate into good exhibitions, or feel more like a series of PhD proposals stuck on the wall. The projects on show in Sharjah tread this fine line with mixed results: some important topics are clouded by opaque theoretical posturing, while others are executed with visceral clarity. One of the most compelling contributions comes from London-based duo Cooking Sections, who have constructed a series of rocky bowls in the school\u2019s forecourt, sunken into the sandy landscape, in which desert plant species have been planted. Looking like mini-volcano craters, these rubble-lined depressions are designed to enable irrigation without water. Based on ancient techniques of cultivation found in places such as Lanzarote and Algeria, the bowls create little micro-climates for the plants, shielding them from wind and collecting condensation on the underside of the rocks. \u201cThe nurseries here in the UAE don\u2019t grow desert plants, because they\u2019re not seen as ornamental,\u201d says Alon Schwabe, one half of the duo. \u201cWe want to propose an alternative model for non-irrigated urban gardens in Sharjah and other arid climates, bringing the desert back into the city.\u201d Working with engineers AKTII, Cooking Sections have equipped their rocky craters with sensors that record factors like leaf moisture, heat radiation and wind speed, displayed on a nearby screen that will monitor the performance of the garden until the next triennial. It is a beautiful, climate-appropriate creation that deserves to be noticed in a place addicted to western ideals of grassy verges and exotic shrubbery \u2013 where water consumption is set to double by 2030, half of it used on irrigation. The problem of water, both its scarcity and overabundance, is a theme of the triennial. Bangladeshi architect Marina Tabassum presents a fascinating study of the delta region in the south of her country where three rivers collide to create a constantly changing landscape. Satellite images show how swaths of sandy soil appear and disappear from one season to the next, seeing families dispossessed of their land overnight, sometimes waiting generations for it to re-emerge from the waters. \u201cUnder British rule, land ownership was formalised with plots drawn on a map,\u201d says Tabassum. \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018dry culture\u2019 idea imposed on a \u2018wet culture\u2019: when the monsoons come, you have a piece of paper, but no land. So families hold on to their papers for years, waiting for the land to come back.\u201d Her research is housed in a series of three charming little timber-framed houses with ornamental rooftops, available to buy off-the-peg in Bangladesh, designed to be disassembled and moved on a truck at a moment\u2019s notice. While the Bengali delta-dwellers have too much water, the Quechua people in the Atacama desert of northern Chile don\u2019t have enough. The battle for access to water is at the forefront of their struggle against global mining conglomerates, whose extractions have seen some local water supplies drop tenfold over the last decade. Stunning backlit aerial photographs shine out from a darkened room, along with a projection-mapped model, depicting ancient geoglyphs carved into the sandy mountainous landscape of the Atacama desert. These primitive works of land art \u2013 depicting human figures, animals and enigmatic symbols \u2013 were created by nomadic travelling tribes, but they\u2019re now being used as a powerful legal tool by the Quechua to stake their claim to the land. \u201cThe mining companies have devoured our resources and poisoned our water,\u201d says Mauricio Hidalgo, president of the indigenous community of Huatacondo in Tarapac\u00e1, who travelled to Sharjah for the triennial. \u201cBut the geoglyphs have given us a voice and a spiritual force that we never imagined we could have. We are regaining our dignity and autonomy because of this public art that our forefathers have bequeathed us.\u201d Working with lawyer and anthropologist Alonso Barros, the community has mobilised the ancient geoglyphs, which now have the status of protected national monuments, in an effort to protect their ancestral lands from further mineral extraction. \u201cThe mining companies respect us today more than ever,\u201d says Hidalgo. Strangely none of this is mentioned in the exhibit itself, which simply focuses on the archaeological beauty of the geoglyphs, with no reference to how they are being weaponised in the fight for territorial justice. The role of art in land-rights struggles is more directly conveyed in another exhibit across town at the Sharjah Art Foundation, where the aboriginal Ngurrara people of Western Australia have brought their stunning Ngurrara Canvas. In a lengthy legal battle in the 90s, the indigenous Australian community had to provide proof of their connection to the area, including the continued existence of laws and customs, and their routes across the land. Feeling that their history couldn\u2019t be expressed in English, they decided to paint their right to the territory instead. The resulting 80sq m painting, made over a fortnight by 40 artists, is a dizzying patchwork quilt of signs and symbols that represent watering holes, campfires, and places of birth and burial, in a kaleidoscopic collage of ritual and memory. (The visual testimony worked: in 2007, the claim was successfully determined in favour of the Ngurrara.) The elephant in the room, looming over all of these powerful explorations of global rights crusades, is the UAE itself. Last year, the country\u2019s most well-known human-rights activist was jailed for 10 years over some tweets, while arbitrary detention of foreign nationals was frequently reported. The authorities continued to deny nationality to thousands of people born in the country, in effect rendering them stateless. Despite recent reforms, migrant construction workers face continued exploitation. Lahoud says workers\u2019 housing conditions formed part of the triennial team\u2019s initial research, but that is mysteriously absent from the show. It also feels like a missed opportunity to engage with some of the urgent architectural and urban issues facing Sharjah itself. Much of the emirate\u2019s fine modernist heritage from the 1970s and 80s is under threat of demolition, while the erection of air-conditioned glass behemoths, like the new Sharjah Mall and Waterfront City complex, continues apace. Under Sheikha Hoor al-Qasimi, daughter of the ruler and the impressive force behind the Sharjah Art Foundation, some progress has been made. The triennial\u2019s venues, including the school and a former vegetable market, have been safeguarded, adding to a dozen vacant buildings of the era that al-Qasimi has managed to preserve as art and community spaces. Another triennial project, by Italian studio Dogma, has seen a vacant lot transformed into a public space, which, it\u2019s hoped, will become permanent. Lahoud has set a powerful political precedent for this new institution, but future editions must have the confidence to engage further with the forces shaping the cities of the UAE, and tackle the country\u2019s rapacious urban development \u2013 before it\u2019s too late.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson would be well advised to stay away from hospitals. His manicured photo-op visits cause extreme indignation to staff, who are kept well away, his presence unannounced to them for fear they would barge in and tell him a few truths. But his advisers still reckon the picture of the prime minister with a nurse or doctor with an ostentatious stethoscope is worth the mostly unheard aggro below stairs when it\u2019s over. Often these visits come with half-promises made to the local press of untold largesse, silencing managers for fear of the money evaporating. At one recently, a director, who wouldn\u2019t let me breathe the hospital\u2019s name publicly, told me that despite the large sums announced at the visit, all they were left with for certain when the PM had gone was a little extra for outdoor canopies under which patients could queue. Queuing \u2013 the old NHS rationing mechanism \u2013 is back with a vengeance. With immense effort and spending, long waiting lists were finally abolished by the Labour government, proving to the many naysayers that it can be done. Today\u2019s latest figures show A&amp;E waiting times in England are the worst since a target of a four-hour maximum delay was introduced in 2004. Will there be an NHS crisis during this winter election? There already is, everywhere. It\u2019s Narnia on the wards: permanent winter, as the pressure never lets up in the summer now, with performance figures rapidly worsening year after year. The condition of the NHS is already critical, before the Australian flu epidemic predicted for this winter has even arrived. Professor John Appleby of the Nuffield Trust warns \u201cone of the bleakest winters in the NHS\u2019s history\u201d is upon us. People waiting on trolleys to be admitted to wards reached 80,000 last month, and he expects worse to come. Labour is promising \u00a35.5bn more a year than the Tories for NHS England by 2023-24. Is that enough? Though that 4.3% annual rise will be the second steepest by a government, after the last Labour government shot it up by 6% a year, no one really expects it to provide the instant magic of a \u201cworld-class health service we need\u201d, which they suggest. How could it, after eight years of starvation at just more than 1% of funding increases a year, compared with the average annual rise in funding since 1948 of 3.7%?

GPs are in critical shortage, with waiting times sorely felt by voters. Under a less pig-headed treasury, more money could instantly solve the pensions crisis that has seen waiting lists soar to 4.6 million as a third of senior doctors abandon extra shifts. The structural damage done by the 2012 Health and Social Care Act is still under repair by the NHS chief executive, Simon Stevens, who is trying to pull back together into a unified service the fragments blown apart in a reform intended by the former Tory health secretary Andrew Lansley to lead to greater competition.

In the latest instalment of our twice-weekly guide to the digital election trail, we look at what people are actually talking about. Are political party messages cutting through? Are campaign groups, thinktanks and commentators having a greater influence than parties on what is shared online? Using data from CrowdTangle, a social media analytics platform, we have examined which material is generating the most attention across Facebook and Instagram. Separately, we have also taken a look at political content trending on YouTube. TV is supposedly a dying medium among younger audiences but the popularity of current affairs clippings is undeniable in this election cycle: several of the most popular election-related Facebook and Instagram posts of the week are UK broadcast TV clips. Here are three examples of repackaged videos that have generated online attention in the past week. Conservatives accused of inventing costs of Labour policies Views 1.7m Comments 2,500 Shares 38,000 Posts from the Labour-affiliated campaign group Momentum consistently do well in terms of Facebook engagement. On Tuesday the group used a clip from BBC Politics Live, in a post accusing the Conservatives of \u201cmaking stuff up\u201d about the costs of Labour\u2019s as-yet unpublished manifesto. In the segment, the programme\u2019s presenter, Jo Coburn, takes Conservative Helen Whately to task over one of her party\u2019s ad campaigns, which relies on largely invented figures for the cost of the Labour party\u2019s policies. Question Time audience member on antisemitism Views 856,000 Comments 1,500 Shares 17,000 BBC Question Time\u2019s Facebook page posted a clip of an audience member accusing media organisations of exaggerating antisemitism allegations against Jeremy Corbyn because they disagree with his policies. The clip, which was taken from the programme\u2019s most recent edition, has been viewed more than 850,000 times. Pro-Brexit group promotes Ian Austin\u2019s Corbyn criticism Views 346,000 Comments 750 Shares 8,000 A third election-related link that has attracted high engagement over the past week clips an interview between Kay Burley of Sky News and the former Labour MP Ian Austin. This was one of a series of interviews in which Austin, who announced last week he would not run for parliament in this election, described Jeremy Corbyn as \u201cnot fit\u201d to be prime minister, a view strongly endorsed by this pro-Brexit Facebook page. The former MP for Dudley North accuses Corbyn of \u201cdefending extremists\u201d and \u201cparroting Putin propaganda\u201d. National security has also emerged as a key line of attack, with the Conservatives putting out multiple versions of a clip of Emily Thornberry being grilled by Piers Morgan on what Corbyn would do in the event of a nuclear missile strike. Hard-right channels do better on YouTube While leftwing pages are performing better on Facebook, the YouTube landscape skews to the right. The 10 most popular channels on the video-uploading platform were a mixture of professional news organisations and highly partisan rightwing content, according to a Guardian analysis of political videos posted on it in the last week. A sample of 350 videos showed the Guardian, Sky News and the Sun had the most popular political content, with around 700,000 views each. In fourth place was a channel called \u201cWE GOT A PROBLEM\u201d which regularly posts pro-Brexit videos with confrontational titles, which received more than 600,000 views. The former Ukip candidate Carl Benjamin, who uses the name Sargon of Akkad on YouTube, and Mahyar Tousi, a Conservative party activist who describes himself as a \u201cfree market fundamentalist\u201d, were also among the top channels. In one popular video, Tousi criticises the Liberal Democrats\u2019 use of charts and polling data, recycling broadcast clips and using an aggressively worded title, a ploy that often helps to increase views on the platform. View counts of election-related video content on YouTube are still far lower than on Facebook or Twitter, however: no video posted by the Labour party in the last week has received more than 5,000 views, and the Conservatives\u2019 peak of 57,000 is much lower than their average viewerships on the other social media platforms. This may explain why the parties are choosing not to focus their efforts on YouTube. The Conservatives have posted just five videos there in the last seven days, compared with more than 30 on Facebook, while Labour has posted nine videos on YouTube, compared with more than 20 on Facebook.

The number of views, comments and shares were accurate as of 12pm on Thursday 14 November.

It\u2019ll be like instead of a secret taping operation, Nixon had a TikTok.\u201d She summed the day up: \u201cToday was not a good start for the Republicans.\u201d Trevor Noah On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah started with George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, who talked through his family lineage, with three generations of his family in public service \u2013 \u201cindeed, there has been a George Kent sworn to defend the constitution continuously for nearly 60 years\u201d. \u201cIt almost sounds like the only reason America keeps running is because of George Kents,\u201d Noah said. \u201cIf America is an office, George Kent is the only guy who can fix the printer.\u201d He said that Trump has clearly done \u201csome messed-up shit\u201d before showing Bill Taylor refer to Trump\u2019s actions as unexplainable, illogical, crazy, which Noah quipped was \u201calso the title of Trump\u2019s new autobiography\u201d. He also spoke about the implicating call that Trump had with an aide, who was in a restaurant, that was so loud that everyone could hear. \u201cFirst of all, that\u2019s rude, you\u2019re in a restaurant, you put your phone away, you engage,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond of all, why is Trump talking so loudly on the phone that people can hear him on the other side? He reminds me of every immigrant father ever talking on the phone.\u201d",

Parents who refuse to get their children inoculated face fines of up to \u20ac2,500 (\u00a32,140) and a likely ban from nursery or school. The measles protection act will come into force next March, and its introduction is likely to be watched closely by advocates of mandatory immunisation in other countries, including Britain. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, said in September the government was \u201clooking very seriously\u201d at making vaccinations compulsory for state school pupils. The Bundestag approved the law on Thursday after months of debate, with doctors speaking out both in favour of and against the legislation. The health ministry, led by Jens Spahn, described the law as \u201cchild protection\u201d and said those who backed it were expressing a responsibility towards the whole of society. \u201cA measles infection is an unnecessary threat in 2019,\u201d he said, amid growing evidence that decisions to not have children vaccinated, in part fuelled by an influential anti-vaccination movement, have led to a steady rise in cases of the illness in Europe where incidence of the disease increased by 350% in 2018 compared to 2017, according to World Health Organization data. Before widespread measles vaccination began in the early 1960s, the disease killed an estimated 2.6 million people globally every year, according to the WHO. That declined to 110,000 deaths in 2017.

The Green party has been among the fiercest critics, widely supporting the vaccination process but arguing it should be backed up with an education campaign rather than forced on people by law. But health professionals have said legislation was the most efficient and effective way to try to reduce the risk of an epidemic. Under the law, both children and staff in childcare facilities including kindergartens, hospitals, asylum-seeker homes and holiday camps must be vaccinated and show proof of the fact. Before the introduction of a measles vaccination 56 years ago, major epidemics of the illness occurred every few years. In Germany there were 543 cases of the disease last year, and this year there have so far been a reported 400 cases. In Europe, incidents rose from about 5,270 cases in 2016 to almost 24,000 the following year. Those who are inoculated against measles will also be protected against mumps and rubella, because of the availability of the vaccine as a triple shot, or sometimes as a quadruple shot including chicken pox. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 November 2019 to clarify that the figure of 2.6 million global deaths from measles applies to the pre-vaccine era. The latest world figure, for 2017, is 110,000.",

If they can be in the Asian equivalent while also somehow performing in Eurovision, I just assume they\u2019ll be in this tournament, and at the very least it might go some way to helping me understand what David Squires is on about when he writes about them instead of England\u201d \u2013 Adam Shilling. \u201cWe met quite a few Finns at Euro 2004 in Portugal in T-shirts with \u2018Suomi\u2019 on the front and \u2018Never Qualified\u2019 on the back. A great bunch of lads, as it happens, who\u2019ll need new T-shirts\u201d \u2013 David Payne. \u201cCongratulations to Jacklin O\u2019Riordan for their creativity in thinking up Finder, the app that is a mix between The Fiver and Tinder (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). One question: since Tinder is already filled with questionable profiles, would you, or anyone, really want to go out with anyone who reads The Fiver too? Think of the kind of folks who\u2019ll be on Finder\u201d \u2013 Nigel Assam. \u201cI remember when The Fiver used to carry a plug for Big Website\u2019s own dating site in every issue. If you began linking to that again, it might expedite Derek McGee\u2019s search for love, and provide more space in the letters for people like me to complain about Tottenham\u201d \u2013 Seth King. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just as well that Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea manager Frank Lampard is no longer in charge of Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County. That fine system (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs) would have to go up a notch to cope with recent events\u201d \u2013 Stephen Hanley. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Adam Shilling, who bags a copy of A Tournament Frozen in Time. We\u2019ve got more prizes to give away, so get scribbling. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS After 29 days in charge, Carl Fletcher has been shown the door marked Do One at Leyton Orient. Harchester wouldn\u2019t have treated him like this. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we have parted company with Carl after such a short time, particularly as we are a club that tries to preserve stability,\u201d tooted chairman Nigel Travis. Macclesfield Town\u2019s problems are continuing to mount after being charged with misconduct over the non-payment of players. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has thanked LA Galaxy after voluntarily leaping ostentatiously to free agency. \u201cI came, I saw, I conquered,\u201d he fibbed. \u201cI gave you Zlatan. You are welcome. The story continues \u2026 now go back to watch baseball.\u201d Blimey. Montreal Impact\u2019s new head coach is \u2026 Thierry Henry. \u201cTo be in Quebec, in Montreal, which has a huge multicultural heritage, it\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d he cheered. Glenn Tamplin is also back, baby! The former Billericay Town owner has taken charge at Romford FC, sacking the managerial team, appointing himself as manager and signing 15 new players. And fans of the January 2020 transfer window will be struggling to contain themselves after it was confirmed the deadline for Premier League clubs will be 11pm GMT on 31 January. STILL WANT MORE? The new documentary on Diego Maradona\u2019s managerial stint in the Mexican second divisions is well worth your time. Ed Vulliamy reports. Finland captain Tim Sparv tells Will Unwin how Finland hauled themselves to the verge of Euro 2020 qualification. How many things do you reckon we\u2019ve got for you to look out for this international break? As per. David Hytner chews over Gareth Southgate\u2019s rather more candid pre-match chat before England v Montenegro. Big Phil Neville needs to be bolder if he is to prolong his England tenure, reckons Suzanne Wrack. Graham Ruthven examines what legacy shy, retiring Zlatan will leave for MLS.

Stephen Waterson, the adopted son of the former MP Nigel Waterson, killed Alfie Lamb in 2018 in what police have said was the first case of death from crush asphyxiation as a result of an electronic car seat. Alfie\u2019s mother, Adrian Hoare, 24, was jailed in May for two years and nine months for child cruelty after she was found guilty of putting the three-year-old into harm\u2019s way by placing him in the footwell of Waterson\u2019s Audi convertible. Sentencing Waterson at the Old Bailey to five years and six months for the child\u2019s manslaughter, Mr Justice Kerr added two years for intimidation and 18 months for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, to run concurrently with each other. Previous hearings heard how the child collapsed on a journey home to Croydon from a shopping trip to Sutton, south London, in February last year. He died in hospital three days later. Waterson had reversed the seat, squashing the child in the footwell behind. He was described by police as \u201carrogant, selfish and deeply unpleasant\u201d. He lied to officers about what happened and threatened his girlfriend and two friends who were also in the car. Waterson and Hoare admitted conspiring to pervert the course of justice by lying to police, and Waterson was convicted of intimidating Hoare and another witness, Marcus Lamb. He was convicted of assaulting a third witness, Emilie Williams, 20, who admitted conspiring to pervert the course of justice after being threatened and \u201ccoerced\u201d into lying to police. Williams, who is due to give birth in January, was sentenced to five months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and 100 hours of unpaid work, to be completed after she gives birth. The court was told that Waterson became annoyed at Alfie\u2019s crying and moved his front passenger seat into him as he sat at his mother\u2019s feet. The maximum space in the footwell was 11.8in (30cm), and at the touch of a button that could be reduced to 3.7in (9.5cm). When Alfie continued to moan, Waterson reversed again, saying, \u201cI won\u2019t be told what to do by a three-year-old,\u201d Hoare told the court. By the time they arrived at Waterson\u2019s home in Croydon, the toddler had collapsed and stopped breathing. As medics tried to revive him, Waterson fled the scene and Hoare started to tell lies in an attempt to protect her boyfriend, claiming she had been in a taxi. He later threatened to make Hoare and the other witnesses \u201cdisappear\u201d if they did not stick to their fake stories. At Thursday\u2019s sentencing, Kerr accepted character references from Waterson\u2019s parents, who attended court, and agreed he was \u201cnot all bad\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Racing is likely to take place at Cheltenham on Saturday, despite the abandonment of Friday\u2019s card, because both the hallowed turf and the weather are drying up, a course official said on Thursday. Simon Claisse, who has been clerk of the course here for 20 years, was dismayed to lose a raceday in November for the first time since he came to work here but added: \u201cWe remain optimistic that things will dry out and we\u2019ll be OK for Saturday.\u201d</p> \n<p>Around 40mm of rain on Wednesday night into Thursday morning meant there was no chance of Friday\u2019s card going ahead, with areas of flooding on the chase and hurdles courses near the two-mile start.

Now the Irish jockey, who made such a stunning breakthrough into the big time last season, is on her way back to take part in the three-day race meeting at the Gloucestershire track this weekend, an occasion that, for many jump-racing fans, marks the true start of each season.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a special place,\u201d the 30-year-old said. \u201cFor anyone who gets a jockey\u2019s licence, a winner at Cheltenham is the dream. It\u2019s brilliant I can say that I\u2019ve done it. There\u2019s always an extra bit of buzz there. Cheltenham in general is a very special place and winners any time of year are hard to come by.\u201d</p> \n<p>Blackmore did so well last winter there was quite a bit of expectation for her prospects at the March Festival, where her total of 17 rides was a record for a female jockey. She delivered on day one with a comfortable handicap success on A Plus Tard, followed three days later by Minella Indo in the Albert Bartlett.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0c6fe32b45d08f9fce9cee48f2d146f40db9df8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0c6fe32b45d08f9fce9cee48f2d146f40db9df8/0_0_8688_5792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachael Blackmore at the Lambourn stables of the trainer Jamie Snowden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachael Blackmore at the Lambourn stables of the trainer Jamie Snowden.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Annerfelt</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cPeople tell you what it\u2019s like to win a race at Cheltenham but I think to believe them, you have to go and do it. It does live up to all expectation. It was a lot of relief when A Plus Tard won, as well as joy, it takes the pressure off. But it was just a fantastic moment. You\u2019ve ridden a winner in Cheltenham, it was incredible. And then for Minella Indo to do it on Friday in a Grade One was very special.\u201d</p> \n<p>Blackmore is \u201creally looking forward\u201d to this return to the scene of those triumphs, though at the moment she is only scheduled to be at Cheltenham on the Friday, before returning to Ireland for valuable contests like Saturday\u2019s Morgiana Hurdle.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/27/female-jockeys-took-cheltenham-glory-but-underestimated-punters-horse-racing\">Female jockeys took Cheltenham glory but still underestimated by punters</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be on Dancing On My Own in the Ballymore Hurdle on Friday. We thought a lot of him last year. He\u2019s got some good form behind Klassical Dream. I was very disappointed with him in Galway, he didn\u2019t perform, but back going left-handed last time, he did it very easily. Hopefully he can do the business. It looks a good race.\u201d</p> \n<p>Life has changed a bit for Blackmore now that her profile is so much higher. She is an ambassador for the bookmaker BetVictor and sounds a shade regretful not to be taking part in the BetVictor Gold Cup at Cheltenham on Saturday. She has a similar <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVRsK3ww-74\" title=\"\">role for Kildare Village</a>, a collection of luxury shops that led to her doing some modelling this summer.</p> \n<p>And she enthuses about her role supporting <a href=\"https://20x20.ie/\" title=\"\">Ireland\u2019s 20x20 campaign</a>, aiming to increase the visibility of women\u2019s sport. \u201cThe aim is to get 20% more coverage by the end of 2020 for women in sport and 20% more participation. It\u2019s a fantastic campaign.\u201d </p> \n<p>She is more reticent about ambitions for her own career. \u201cA lot of jockeys would say the same, you\u2019re just going day by day, I don\u2019t set myself any major targets. I never would have set myself a target of what I\u2019ve achieved, so I think I\u2019ll just continue with that mentality, take every day as it comes and hope to just keep the momentum up and stay in the winner\u2019s enclosure.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"11ea768c-9540-45d3-b953-bcbbd39c42dd\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Newcastle<br></b><b>12.00</b>&nbsp;Mr Love&nbsp;<b>12.30</b>&nbsp;Speak Of The Devil (nb)&nbsp;<b>1.05</b>&nbsp;Chanting Hill&nbsp;<b>1.40</b>&nbsp;Skipping On&nbsp;<b>2.15</b>&nbsp;Royal Claret&nbsp;<b>2.50</b>&nbsp;The King Of May&nbsp;<b>3.25</b>&nbsp;Wetlands</p>\n    <p><b>Southwell</b><br><b>12.50</b>&nbsp;Grand Coureur&nbsp;<b>1.25</b>&nbsp;Sartene's Son&nbsp;<b>2.00</b>&nbsp;Jepeck&nbsp;<b>2.35</b>&nbsp;Shantou Vow&nbsp;<b>3.10</b>&nbsp;Peltwell (nap)&nbsp;<b>3.45</b>&nbsp;Leskinfere</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

And then for Minella Indo to do it on Friday in a Grade One was very special.\u201d Blackmore is \u201creally looking forward\u201d to this return to the scene of those triumphs, though at the moment she is only scheduled to be at Cheltenham on the Friday, before returning to Ireland for valuable contests like Saturday\u2019s Morgiana Hurdle. \u201cI\u2019ll be on Dancing On My Own in the Ballymore Hurdle on Friday. We thought a lot of him last year. He\u2019s got some good form behind Klassical Dream. I was very disappointed with him in Galway, he didn\u2019t perform, but back going left-handed last time, he did it very easily. Hopefully he can do the business. It looks a good race.\u201d Life has changed a bit for Blackmore now that her profile is so much higher. She is an ambassador for the bookmaker BetVictor and sounds a shade regretful not to be taking part in the BetVictor Gold Cup at Cheltenham on Saturday. She has a similar role for Kildare Village, a collection of luxury shops that led to her doing some modelling this summer. And she enthuses about her role supporting Ireland\u2019s 20x20 campaign, aiming to increase the visibility of women\u2019s sport. \u201cThe aim is to get 20% more coverage by the end of 2020 for women in sport and 20% more participation. It\u2019s a fantastic campaign.\u201d She is more reticent about ambitions for her own career. \u201cA lot of jockeys would say the same, you\u2019re just going day by day, I don\u2019t set myself any major targets. I never would have set myself a target of what I\u2019ve achieved, so I think I\u2019ll just continue with that mentality, take every day as it comes and hope to just keep the momentum up and stay in the winner\u2019s enclosure.\u201d",

The construction sector continues to run above capacity and is lending support to growth. </p> <p>This doesn\u2019t change our narrative. Underlying growth trend is weak and the economic outlook remains subdued. Germany avoided a technical recession but will continue to pose very low growth rates over the next year. Important trading partners like China, the US, Turkey and Sweden are experiencing an economic slowdown, and high-frequency indicators show the services sector slowing down. Employment prospects are also gloomy. </p> <p>This data release will deter the German government from engaging in further fiscal stimulus, at least for now. We saw some debate over a more expansive fiscal policy in the last few months but Germany\u2019s view is that unless the economy goes through a recession, a fiscal stimulus package is unnecessary. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Matthew Cady, Investment Strategist at Brooks Macdonald:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe German economy avoided a technical recession in 3Q, by posting this morning a surprise positive +0.1% 3Q QoQ GDP growth (vs -0.1% expected).

      "bodyText": "Time for a very quick recap Germany has avoided recession. Europe\u2019s largest economy grew by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2019, defying expectations of a second small contraction in a row. Household consumption, government spending and exports all drove growth, but the factory sector continues to struggle. Experts fear 2020 will be tough. Berlin is resisting pressure for fresh stimulus measures. Finance minister Olaf Scholz says Germany isn\u2019t in a crisis, but ought to be growing faster. Today\u2019s data put Germany below the UK, the US and France on the global growth league. Japan is also struggling, with growth dropping to just 0.1% China\u2019s economy is also under pressure. Retail sales, industrial production and fixed investment all grew at a slower rate last month. Retail sales growth in the UK has slowed. Sales volumes dropped by 0.2% last month, despite a burst of stockpiling Stock markets have dipped, as concerns over trade war talks resurface. Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund has blacklisted security firm G4S. It\u2019s concerned about the risk of human rights violations, over its work in Qatar and the UAE. The escalating crisis in Hong Kong continues to weigh on markets today, after a fourth day of serious protests in the city. Airline Cathay Pacific and fashion chain Burberry both reported that their trading has been disrupted by the pro-democracy demonstrations. This is likely to continue, as clashes between protesters and riot police intensify. Looks like Christine Lagarde has been trying to smooth rifts in at the European Central Bank. The new ECB president has taken her colleagues for an away day to discuss how to improve things, following the disputes over predecessor Mario Draghi\u2019s stimulus moves. It\u2019s not terribly informal, apart from the men not wearing ties. And honestly, having more women in the portraits than around the table is a terrible look. Stocks have dipped very slightly at the start of trading in New York. The Dow, which hit yet another record high last night, dropped by about 0.1%. Relief that Germany has avoided recession is being countered by concerns that there\u2019s little sign of progress in the US-China trade talks If Berlin won\u2019t boost government spending, then Germany\u2019s recovery could depend on a pick-up in global growth. And *that* could rely on the US and China, who are still to resolve their trade dispute. Jack McIntyre, Portfolio Manager Global Fixed Income at Brandywine Global, explains: \u201cSince the global economy is currently in a manufacturing recession, and Germany is a manufacturing powerhouse, it is no surprise that the German economy is bearing the brunt of the slowdown. Domestic demand isn\u2019t enough to offset this global drag. On an overall basis, Europe is a taker of global growth while China and the US are the main contributors. What we see as a more important forecaster of German GDP is the direction of U.S. and Chinese growth. If the German economy is going to do better, China needs to do better first.\u201d The number of Americans filing new employment claims has risen. The US initial claims total jumped to 225,000 people last week, up from 211,000 in the previous seven days. That\u2019s 10,000 more than economists expected, although still low in historic terms. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s finance minister has just dampened hopes of a new stimulus package to support growth. Olaf Scholz told a conference in Berlin, organised by Bloomberg, that Germany was not in an economic crisis. As such, there is no immediate need for a spending boost, he argued. Scholz told a Bloomberg conference in Berlin: \u201cWe are cautiously optimistic. We will have bigger growth next year.\u201d Andreas Steno Larsen of Nordea Markets reckons Scholz is giving a clear signal that Berlin won\u2019t bow to pressure. Germany is certainly in a better state than Britain in 1979, and PM Jim Callaghan\u2019s famous \u201cCrisis? What Crisis?\u201d Sun front page. (Callaghan actually said \u201cI don\u2019t think other people in the world would share the view there is mounting chaos\u201d, but that wasn\u2019t such a good headline). Here\u2019s our news story on the UK retail sales slowdown: Most advanced economies has now reported growth figures for the last quarter (although we\u2019re still waiting for Canada!). Germany, despite avoiding recession, is one of the weakest performers in July-September. Here\u2019s a selection of the latest quarterly growth figures. US: +0.5% quarter-on-quarter Spain: +0.4% q/q The Netherlands: +0.4% q/q UK: +0.3% q/q France: +0.3% q/q Italy: +0.1% q/q Germany: +0.1% q/q Japan: +0.1% q/q Economist Rupert Seggins has pulled together the year-on-year growth figures: European Central Bank\u2019s Vice President Luis De Guindos has predicted there\u2019s a \u201cvery low\u201d risk of a eurozone recession, now that Germany has returned to growth. However, he also fears that growth could remain below potential, unless governments step up and do more. Reuters has the details. De Guindos made the comments after data showed the euro zone\u2019s largest economy, Germany, narrowly avoided falling into a technical recession of two consecutive quarters of economic shrinkage. Europe was in a place where growth remained \u201cbelow potential\u201d De Guindos said at a BNP Paribas banking conference, adding that the ECB needed \u201cto pay close attention\u201d to the situation. In September, the ECB pushed euro zone interest rates further into negative territory and said it was restarting its mass bond-buying programme having only wound it down at the end of last year. De Guindos also echoed recent calls for governments to step up their economic support measures and that low bank profitability was the main threat to euro zone financial stability. Here\u2019s a round-up of reaction to Germany\u2019s economy growing by 0.1% in the last quarter, avoiding the recession which many analysts expected. Dr. Kerstin Braun, President of Stenn Group. \u201cWe know uncertainty is a killer for the economy. UK growth was the slowest in a decade. Germany has only narrowly avoided a recession, but it\u2019s not out of the woods just yet. Now the effects of uncertainty have become reality. Companies are having to deal with the consequences of the global economic meltdown \u2013 margins are squeezed, output is down and balance sheets are weak. \u201cWith fewer than one in five CFOs willing to take on risk, we\u2019ll see slashed budgets for companies going into 2020. People are going to start feeling the impact from fewer jobs and frozen wages as companies remain inhibited by the uncertain economic outlook.\u201d Ana Andrade, analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit: Growth surprised on the upside. The construction sector continues to run above capacity and is lending support to growth. This doesn\u2019t change our narrative. Underlying growth trend is weak and the economic outlook remains subdued. Germany avoided a technical recession but will continue to pose very low growth rates over the next year. Important trading partners like China, the US, Turkey and Sweden are experiencing an economic slowdown, and high-frequency indicators show the services sector slowing down. Employment prospects are also gloomy. This data release will deter the German government from engaging in further fiscal stimulus, at least for now. We saw some debate over a more expansive fiscal policy in the last few months but Germany\u2019s view is that unless the economy goes through a recession, a fiscal stimulus package is unnecessary. Matthew Cady, Investment Strategist at Brooks Macdonald: \u201cThe German economy avoided a technical recession in 3Q, by posting this morning a surprise positive +0.1% 3Q QoQ GDP growth (vs -0.1% expected). At the same time, however, 2Q GDP growth was revised downwards to -0.2% QoQ (from -0.1% QoQ previously). Effectively, it leaves the German economy close in stagnation. .... That today\u2019s number is better than slightly expected is potentially the worst of both worlds\u2026 not strong enough to assuage growth fears in the Eurozone and not weak enough to push Germany into a meaningful fiscal response. Japan\u2019s economy has also been hit by the US-China trade war and the weakening global economy. Data released overnight showed that the world\u2019s third-largest economy grew an annualized rate of just 0.2 percent -- or 0.1% during the quarter. That\u2019s down from 1.8% annualised growth in April to June. Just in: The eurozone grew by 0.2% in the third quarter of the year, helped by the modest recovery in Germany. That\u2019s according to the latest GDP report from Eurostat, which confirms last month\u2019s \u2018flash estimate\u2019. This matches the 0.2% growth recorded in the second quarter of 2019, but weaker than the 0.4% seen in Q1. Just in: UK retail sales were weaker than expected last month. Retail sales volumes fell by 0.1% during October, the Office for National Statistics says. Economists had expected a rise of 0.2%. Strip out petrol, and volumes were down 0.3%. Over the last quarter, retail sales were only 0.2% higher, with food sales the only sector that rose. That implying UK consumers have been reluctant to spend on big-ticket items or discretionary goods. NEWSFLASH: UK services company G4S has been sensationally blacklisted by Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, for human rights abuses. In a stinging rebuke, the Norway\u2019s Council of Ethics said the company was contributing to \u201csystematic human rights violations\u201d of migrant workers in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The Council, which monitors investments in Norway\u2019s Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), says: In April 8, 2019, the Council on Ethics recommended that G4S PLC (G4S) be excluded from the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) because of an unacceptable risk of the company contributing to systematic human rights violations. The Council\u2019s investigations show that workers have paid recruitment fees to work for the company, and that workers have taken out loans in their home country to be able to pay the fees. When the workers arrive in the Gulf, they must spend a significant part of their salary to pay off this debt, and therefore have little chance of leaving. Many also received far lower wages than agreed, and in the Emirates, the workers got their passport confiscated. The Council\u2019s investigations also revealed long working days, a lack of overtime payment and examples of harassment. Here\u2019s the story: The GPFG has blacklisted companies before, often because they damage the climate or produce tobacco or coal. Last month, the Guardian reported that hundreds of migrant workers were dying in Qatar each month from heat stress. Many have been toiling to build the infrastructure for the 2022 football World Cup: Car giant Daimler has highlighted the challenges in Germany\u2019s economy, by announcing major job cuts. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: Mercedes-Benz plans to save \u20ac1.65bn (\u00a31.4bn) by cutting more than 1,000 jobs in the latest sign German carmakers are struggling to make big investments in electric car technology. Carmakers around the world are spending billions on developing battery-powered electric vehicles but at the same time sales of internal combustion engines are slowing in the face of economic weakness and scandals over emissions. Mercedes-Benz\u2019s premium cars division will bear the bulk of the job cuts, its parent company, Daimler, said on Thursday, with cuts of \u20ac1bn from its wage bill expected by 2022. Management and contractors will be particularly affected, while the vans and trucks divisions will together cut \u20ac650m in staff and other costs. Daimler said it would cap investment in property, plant and equipment and in research and development at current levels, with plans in place to reduce investment in the medium term. Germany\u2019s return to (modest) growth may lift some pressure from Angela Merkel\u2019s government to boost spending. But that could be a mistake. Berlin\u2019s balanced budget policy had been under growing criticism as the economy contracted over the summer, factory output declined and exports fell. Some economists argued forcefully that Merkel\u2019s administration should abandon the \u2018debt brake\u2019 that effectively bans budget deficits outside of a crisis. With borrowing costs at record lows, surely policymakers should boost investment? Many financial experts think so. Deutsche Bank has just surveyed nearly 700 of its clients, and found that most of them oppose the debt brake. Deutsche\u2019s Jim Reid says: In terms of German fiscal policy only 4% thought Germany should stick to \u201cblack zero\u201d type policies and only an additional 15% thought they should wait for a deep recession to deploy fiscal. 81% thought they should be either expanding fiscal now (33%) or be ready to do so over the next 12 month if growth stayed weak but positive (48%). European stock markets have all fallen this morning, despite Germany\u2019s better-than-expected growth report. Mining stocks and technology firms are among the fallers, following that disappointing data from China overnight. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The Chinese economy continues to cool down as the latest economic reports showed overnight. Fixed asset investment, retail sales and industrial production came in at 5.2%, 7.2% and 4.7% respectively. All reports registered declines in addition to undershooting economists\u2019 forecasts. Mining stocks are largely lower this morning on the back of the data from China, as the country is a major importer of minerals. Germany\u2019s escape from recession is being overshadowed by weak economic data from China. Fixed asset investment growth has fallen to its lowest level on record, at 5.2%, the National Bureau of Statistics reported. That suggests companies are reluctant to invest. Industrial production growth only rose by 4.7%, below forecasts, as the trade war with the US bites. Retail sales growth dropped to a 16-year low too, implying consumers are more cautious. There are some signs that Germany\u2019s economy could pick up, having effectively stagnated for the last six months, says Lee Hardman of Japanese bank MUFG. He tells clients: Continued growth in the service sector has helped to offset more acute weakness in the manufacturing sector. Recent leading indicators have provided tentative signs of optimism that the German economy is close to the worst point and could begin to pick up gradually in 2020. The latest ZEW survey, trade, factory orders reports have all surprised to the upside. The global manufacturing PMI bottomed in July providing encouragement that the global industrial slowdown is beginning to ease as well Germany\u2019s car sector is dragging the economy back, warns Deka bank analyst Andreas Scheuerle. He says (via Reuters): \u201cThe German economy got away with a black eye: the technical recession [is] avoided.\u201d \u201cGermany\u2019s economy is suffering from enormous global political uncertainty. Germany\u2019s flagship industry, the automobile sector, is not running smoothly anymore.\u201d Germany\u2019s government isn\u2019t popping the champagne corks, despite avoiding the ignominy of recession this morning. Economy minister Peter Altmaier has warned that growth is still too low, telling the ARD TV station that: \u201cWe do not have a technical recession, but the growth numbers are still too weak\u201d Carsten Brzeski, European economist at ING, says Germany\u2019s economy is effectively stagnating -- despite dodging recession this morning. He points out that German manufacturers, once a powerhouse of the EU, are really struggling: Recession or not, the German economy has fallen into a de facto stagnation, with quarterly GDP growth averaging a meagre 0.1% QoQ since the third quarter of last year. In fact, the German economy can still be divided into two worlds: the depressive world and the happy-go-lucky one. In the depressive world, there are very few signs of an imminent bottoming or recovery of the manufacturing sector since the summer of 2018. The sector is facing and will continue to face cyclical challenges, as ongoing trade conflicts, Brexit uncertainty and slower Chinese growth, along with structural challenges, disrupt the automotive industry. In the happy-go-lucky world, private consumption remains solid on the back of low inflation, low interest rates and a still-strong labour market. The construction sector keeps on booming and the government is also inserting some fiscal stimulus. Brzeski also fears that Germany could struggle next year too. Looking into 2020, it looks as if either the cyclical factors weighing on German industry will dissipate somewhat, with the entire economy rebounding, or the domestic part of the economy will also slow down. Either way, don\u2019t forget that the structural challenges will not quickly and easily disappear, keeping a clear cap on any German rebound in 2020. Economists are pleased to see that Europe\u2019s largest economy has dodged recession. However, Fred Dukrozet of Swiss bank Pictet points out that it was pretty close -- Germany actually only grew by 0.08% in the last three months. Increased spending by German consumers and government bodies helped to drag its economy out of recession, today\u2019s GDP report shows. Exports have also picked up, despite trade tensions, helping the economy to expand by 0.1%. However, investment at German factories has fallen. Statistics body Destatis says: Compared with the second quarter of 2019, household final consumption expenditure increased, and so did government final consumption expenditure. Exports rose, while imports remained roughly at the level of the previous quarter. Also, gross fixed capital formation in construction was up on the previous quarter. Gross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment, however, was lower than in the previous quarter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a particularly Guten Morgen in Germany today. The economy has just avoided recession with a surprise return to growth in July to September. Germany has defied the doom mongers by expanding its GDP by 0.1% in the third quarter of this year, new data shows. That means Europe\u2019s largest economy has stopped contracting, after suffering a 0.2% contraction in April-June (that\u2019s just been revised down from a 0.1% fall). This is welcome news for Europe\u2019s economy, as it battles a global slowdown, Brexit uncertainty, and the spillover effects of the US-China trade war. Economists had predicted that German GDP would fall again in Q3, by around 0.1%. But it appears that household spending had helped overcome the weakness in German factories. On an annual basis, Germany\u2019s economy has grown by just 1% in the last year - or just 0.5% on a \u2018price and calendar adjusted basis\u2019. Detail and reaction to follow....

      "bodyText": "National Grid has ploughed a record of almost \u00a32bn into its booming US-based business this year as increasing political pressure raises questions over the multinational\u2019s future in the UK. The energy network provider spent nearly \u00a31.6bn growing its regulated US business over the first six months of the year, and also invested \u00a3200m into its US-based renewables company Geronimo. Over the same period, National Grid spent less than \u00a3650m running the gas and electricity networks in the UK, where policymakers are squeezing energy company profits and proposals to renationalise utilities have won public support. The London-listed company has built its US presence in recent years amid growing calls for UK utilities to be renationalised. It distributes gas and electricity to businesses and homes in New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. John Pettigrew, National Grid\u2019s chief executive, said the record spending was in response to strong demand from north-eastern US states to transform their energy system to run on renewables. There was also healthy investor appetite for infrastructure projects, he said. The US business helped drive National Grid\u2019s underlying operating profits to \u00a31.3bn for the first half of the year. In the UK, profits from its electricity networks rose by 5% to \u00a3583m, while profits from its gas grid business fell by more than a quarter to \u00a366m. In the US, underlying operating profits rose 16% from the year before to \u00a3525m. National Grid has had disputes with regulators on both sides of the Atlantic in 2019. The company is under investigation for its role in Britain\u2019s biggest blackout in a decade after 1 million people in England were left without electricity in August. The inquiry has piled pressure on National Grid in the run-up to the general election, which could lead to renationalisation of energy networks if the Labour party comes to power. National Grid\u2019s long-running gas dispute with regulators in the US peaked this week after the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, threatened to strip the company of its licence to operate in parts of the city. The company has refused to connect new customers to the gas grid in Brooklyn, Queens and parts of Long Island after regulators ruled out a $1bn (\u00a3776m) gas pipeline for the city. Pettrigrew said National Grid had been working tirelessly to solve the dispute since it made the difficult decision to put a moratorium on new gas connections. He said he was confident the company could deliver a solution to the regulatory impasse within days.",

He said he supported raising taxes \u201con the most prosperous and the most fortunate, not as a penalty but because we all have a stake as a national community in building our future\u201d.</p> <p>Patrick was expected to appear in New Hampshire, where he will enter February\u2019s primary.

      "bodyText": "The former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick has entered the race for the Democratic presidential nomination to take on Donald Trump next year. Patrick, who said in 2018 he would not run, had indicated the announcement was coming. A YouTube video was duly released early on Thursday morning with the campaign slogan \u201cDeval for all\u201d. \u201cYou can\u2019t know if you can break through unless you get out and try,\u201d Patrick said in an interview with CBS This Morning. He praised the \u201creally talented and really gifted\u201d field of Democrats already seeking the nomination but said he saw an opportunity for someone with his vision. In what appeared to be a swipe at the party frontrunners, the former vice-president Joe Biden and the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, Patrick said: \u201cWe seem to be migrating on the one camp toward nostalgia \u2026 and on the other camp it\u2019s \u2018our big idea or no way\u2019.\u201d Asked where he stands on key Democratic issues, Patrick said he does not support Medicare for All \u201cin the terms we\u2019ve been talking about\u201d but plans to push for a \u201cpublic option\u201d. He said he supported raising taxes \u201con the most prosperous and the most fortunate, not as a penalty but because we all have a stake as a national community in building our future\u201d. Patrick was expected to appear in New Hampshire, where he will enter February\u2019s primary. He is also expected to focus hard on South Carolina, an early voting state with a sizeable African American electorate. In his YouTube video, Patrick discussed his youth in the South Side of Chicago and his experience in \u201cgovernment, nonprofits and in business\u201d. Among items on Patrick\u2019s CV not mentioned in the video was a post-statehouse spell working for Bain Capital, the private investment firm founded by Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee. The 63-year-old was governor of Massachusetts from 2007 to 2015, the first African American in the post, and is a close ally of the former president Barack Obama. His entry into the 2020 race follows the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg filing to enter state primaries, though he has made no final decision about whether he will run. Bloomberg\u2019s flirtation with a run has been attributed to Biden\u2019s missteps and faltering polling numbers. The former vice-president is seen as the centrist choice in a sprawling field against Warren and Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont. Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, rounds out the top four in polling, surging strongly in Iowa, the first state to vote. No one else has made a significant mark. Defeating Trump is seen as paramount among a Democratic establishment worried the primary is shifting too far left. \u201cI admire and respect the candidates in the Democratic field,\u201d Patrick said in the YouTube video. \u201cThey bring a richness of ideas and experience and a depth of character that makes me proud to be a Democrat. But if the character of the candidates is an issue in every election, this time it\u2019s about the character of the country.\u201d He did not mention Trump by name. The 2020 election, he said, will be about \u201cthe character of the country \u2026 about more than removing an unpopular and divisive leader, as important as that is.\u201d He then promised to build a more inclusive America, declared his candidacy and vowed to \u201cbuild as we climb\u201d. In an interview with the Boston Globe, Patrick acknowledged that his presidential campaign was a long shot, comparing it to a desperate football pass thrown as a last resort. \u201cThis is a Hail Mary from two stadiums over,\u201d he said.",

Like much else in Spain, the recent weather could charitably be described as changeable. On Sunday, the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE) won the country\u2019s fourth general election in as many years, the far-right Vox stormed into third place, and the Citizens party \u2013 once touted as the future of the Spanish centre ground \u2013 collapsed into an ignominious heap. Fewer than 48 hours later, the PSOE and the anti-austerity Podemos announced the preliminary coalition deal that had proved so elusive after the Socialists won the last election in April but failed to secure a majority.

Having capitalised on voter discontent and the question of Spanish unity, he added, the party may now ape other successful European far-right parties by adopting \u201cchauvinist strategies\u201d over the welfare state. \u201cVox still hasn\u2019t really started doing that, but I\u2019m sure they know that it\u2019s a strategy that would help them grow,\u201d said Sim\u00f3n. \u201cIf there is a PSOE-Podemos government backed by Catalan pro-independence parties, that will only help Vox keep hammering away when it comes to territorial questions and general political discontent. Add to that a discourse over immigrants taking up resources and you\u2019ve got three elements that could help Vox grow still more at the next election.\u201d There is much that is familiar and contemporary in Vox\u2019s appetite for border walls, in its paradoxical, if not hypocritical, antipathy towards elites, and in its demonisation of immigrants. And then there is the nostalgia that verges on the atavistic. Juan Montoya hankers after the peace and co-existence of the past and cannot fathom the Socialists\u2019 decision to exhume Franco from the Valley of the Fallen last month. \u201cWhat has it achieved?\u201d he wondered. \u201cIt\u2019s just revived tensions between people. They should just have left him in his tomb.\u201d Juan Francisco Cruz, meanwhile, mourns the political correctness of the present. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie to say that Vox are racist. They\u2019re just the only party that has the balls to come out and tell the truth about things.\u201d",

There are definitely legitimate questions about Labour policy: as part of its proposed renegotiation of the Brexit deal, would it now be prepared to accept free movement with the EU, which in turn would unlock the possibility of continued UK membership of the single market (a policy that <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/wxdn9e6z4w/TheSundayTimes_VI_191108_w.pdf\" title=\"\">recent polls</a> suggest is surprisingly popular)?

Pending their manifesto, we just don\u2019t know.</p> <p>But the Conservatives\u2019 claim that Labour will introduce free movement with the entire world is obviously nonsensical and has already <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/immigration/labour-immigration-policy/\" title=\"\">been debunked</a>.

      "bodyText": "What should we make of the Conservatives\u2019 claims this morning that Labour policy would mean net migration would increase by 1.2 trillion over the next five years? Oh, wait. That was their claim about Labour spending plans \u2013 in fact, their \u201cresearch\u201d suggests that migration would rise by a mere 840,000. For those of us who work with numbers for a living, and frequently bemoan the lack of public understanding of key economic and social statistics, the way figures are abused by political parties during election campaigns is deeply depressing. (While not on the same scale as the torrent of unreliable Tory projections, Labour has made some dishonest predictions of its own \u2013 such as the claim that a Trump trade deal would cost the NHS \u00a3500m a week.) The Conservatives\u2019 migration numbers can easily be dismissed \u2013 in fact, they couldn\u2019t even be bothered to get the current levels of migration right, ignoring the latest official Office for National Statistics projections. Even better, they\u2019ve invented something called a \u201cnet visa grant\u201d, a completely nonexistent concept that I suspect will mystify the Home Office officials who are actually in charge of granting visas. I doubt this will have much credibility with anyone who hasn\u2019t already bought into a completely paranoid narrative about \u201cfloods\u201d of migrants, or the entire population of Turkey moving here if we stay in the EU. There are definitely legitimate questions about Labour policy: as part of its proposed renegotiation of the Brexit deal, would it now be prepared to accept free movement with the EU, which in turn would unlock the possibility of continued UK membership of the single market (a policy that recent polls suggest is surprisingly popular)? And, while they have rejected quotas and income thresholds, how would their policy on non-EU migration for work differ in practice from the Conservatives\u2019 proposals? Pending their manifesto, we just don\u2019t know. But the Conservatives\u2019 claim that Labour will introduce free movement with the entire world is obviously nonsensical and has already been debunked. The more interesting aspect is what it\u2019s designed to obscure. In fact, what the Conservatives are trying to do here is to bury good news \u2013 that is, the long-overdue abandonment of David Cameron and Theresa May\u2019s economically illiterate and politically damaging target to reduce immigration to the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d. A little personal history may be in order here. When I was chief economist in the Cabinet Office in late 2010, I warned the then prime minister that he was setting himself up to fail \u2013 reducing non-EU migration very substantially would require economically damaging restrictions on skilled and student migration (absent a very prolonged recession), while EU migration would probably rise in 2014 (just before the next election) as controls were lifted on Bulgarians and Romanians. In the end, of course, he got the worst of all worlds: May\u2019s nasty policies, a high-profile missed target and then, in reaction to that, a doomed attempt to end free movement as part of his renegotiation of our EU membership. And we all know how that ended. So the replacement of the target with a much vaguer commitment to \u201ccut immigration overall\u201d is positive. And it suggests a welcome, if belated, recognition of reality \u2013 that ending free movement will reduce EU migration. And that, given the needs of the UK economy, not to mention public services, will require a considerably more liberal policy towards skilled migration from outside the EU.

The Trump Organization signed the lease for the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue in 2013. It opened in October 2016, shortly before Donald Trump won the White House. Controversy over Trump\u2019s continued links to his business holdings, which he did not sell off after winning the White House, has been a theme of his presidency. Efforts to sell off the hotel lease were first reported last month. Eric Trump, the president\u2019s second son, said in a statement at the time: \u201cPeople are objecting to us making so much money on the hotel, and therefore we may be willing to sell.\u201d The sale brochure, CNN reported, claims the hotel has turned away foreign government bookings, \u201csacrifices\u201d it claims cost it 17,100 lost room nights in 2019, resulting in $5.3m in lost room revenue and $3.9m in lost food and beverage revenue. The brochure does not say how much business from foreign governments the hotel accepted, CNN said. In 2018 the Washington Post reported that a Saudi-backed lobbyist paid $270,000 to book nearly 500 rooms for US military veterans soon after the 2016 election. Ironically, CNN reported that the sales brochure identifies another source of possible increased revenue: the building of a new Amazon HQ in nearby Arlington, Virginia. The agent hired by the Trump Organization to sell the hotel says Amazon \u2013 owned by Jeff Bezos, also owner of the Washington Post and the target of considerable presidential invective \u2013 could add 880,000 room nights in seven years. Other Trump properties, including golf clubs in Ireland and Scotland, have been subject to accusations that they have profited from US taxpayer-backed bookings and bookings by foreign governments. The most explicit claim that one of the president\u2019s businesses would violate constitutional emoluments clauses against profiteering from elected office was lodged in September, when Trump\u2019s Miami Doral golf club was named as the site of the next G20 summit. Following an outcry, Trump dropped the idea.",

When he woke, he remembered a New York Times article that said acting out dreams can be an early sign of Parkinson\u2019s disease.

      "bodyText": "The two police officers facing criminal charges over the death of the former footballer Dalian Atkinson have been suspended from duty, the Guardian has learned. One officer, PC Benjamin Monk, faces a charge of murder, while another, PC Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith, is charged with assault. The family of the former Aston Villa player, who died in August 2016 after contact with police, said they were surprised the officers had not been suspended until this week. The West Mercia officers were initially suspended after being placed under investigation, then returned to work on restricted duties in February 2018. The two officers were suspended this week after the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to charge them with criminal offences. Atkinson, 48, died after police were called to his father\u2019s home in Telford, Shropshire, in the early hours of 15 August 2016. A stun gun and other force were used on the former footballer during the incident. Kate Maynard, the solicitor for the Atkinson family, welcomed the suspension of the officers: \u201cThe family were surprised to hear in February 2018 that the officers had been reinstated (albeit on restricted duties) following their initial suspension. They welcome that the officers are now suspended again and look forward to the criminal process taking its course.\u201d The charges followed a three-year investigation by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct. West Mercia police said: \u201cThe officers were suspended whilst the initial IOPC investigation was under way. This was reviewed in February 2018 and the officers returned to work on restricted duties.\u201d The assistant chief constable of West Mercia police, Martin Evans, said: \u201cIn accordance with the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2012, following the decision by CPS to charge the officers with a criminal offence, a suspension hearing has taken place.

The IOPC had previously said of its inquiry: \u201cThe investigation gathered evidence which indicates that police contact with Mr Atkinson involved the use of a Taser, followed by a period of restraint and other uses of force.\u201d The events that led to the criminal charges being brought happened while Atkinson, who lived nearby, was visiting his father in Telford.

      "body": "<p>Jeton Neziraj has clear views about the role of drama. \u201cTheatre should be on the side of those who have no power, on the side of victims, on the side of minorities,\u201d he says. Arguably Kosovo\u2019s leading playwright, he attacks his country\u2019s political issues head-on. His 2018 play The Hypocrites, or The English Patient, savaged the dire state of the healthcare system and was inspired by a bribery scandal. He published one of his plays \u2013 in which Serbia and Kosovo fight it out for the EU spot vacated by the UK \u2013 under the pseudonym \u201ca Kosovar cynic\u201d. His 2017 play, 55 Shades of Gay, which played at New York\u2019s LaMaMa theatre this year, dealt with the bureaucratic and social fallout when a gay couple register to marry in a Kosovar town. His new play, <a href=\"https://citygarage.org/\">Department of Dreams</a>, an Orwellian comedy set in an autocracy, is currently at the City Garage theatre in Los Angeles. A fable-like drama set in a world where people are obliged to deposit their dreams in a large state-controlled bank and \u201cwould-be dictators want to control all aspects of people\u2019s lives\u201d, the play is applicable to more countries than just Kosovo.</p> <p>Neziraj is dizzyingly prolific \u2013 he has written more than 25 plays \u2013 and his work has been performed all around Europe, though not yet in the UK. The plays are raucous, irreverent and absurdist. They invoke Ibsen, Moli\u00e8re and Kafka, while raging against corruption and injustice, forcing the audience to confront the wounds of a country that only gained its independence in 2008, and where the war and its aftermath are still being processed.</p> <p>Neziraj studied playwriting in the 90s, though it wasn\u2019t possible to see much theatre at the time as state institutions were under Serbian control. In 2002 he helped set up the production company Qendra Multimedia. It started out producing children\u2019s theatre but soon expanded its remit to include adult plays and a literature festival, Polip, to promote cultural exchange between Serbia and Kosovo. This year they launched a graphic-novel festival.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/apr/05/romeo-and-juliet-kosovo-war-shakespeare-serbia\">Borrowing Cupid\u2019s wings: Romeo and Juliet helps heal the scars of Kosovo war</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From 2008 to 2011 Neziraj was the artistic director of the National Theatre of Kosovo. He believes his contract wasn\u2019t renewed because of his anti-nationalist stance and his unwillingness to let the theatre be used as a tool of the authorities. This prompted a shift in his writing: he decided to make work dealing directly with the country\u2019s most pressing political issues. \u201cIn Kosovo,\u201d he explains, \u201cthere are issues that we, as artists, have to confront on stage and as part of the public discourse.\u201d The first play he wrote in this vein was Yue Madelaine Yue, about the experience of the Roma in Kosovo. He also wanted to make work that could be staged internationally and compete on the European theatre market, to tell Kosovo stories in universal terms, be it through retooling Ibsen or employing international composers and designers to address the inadequate training and support of local artists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c934d8552fa91edc745c63bf581d577ceba53ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c934d8552fa91edc745c63bf581d577ceba53ec/0_0_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeton Neziraj.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If we make one compromise, we will be pressured to make more\u2019 \u2026 Jeton Neziraj.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Armend Nimani/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Neziraj is surprisingly laid-back for someone so busy, and behind his warmth lies a dry sense of humour. But he believes wholly in theatre\u2019s importance. \u201cWe try to determine what is the story that needs to be told now, that cannot wait for next year. We won\u2019t compromise on the content. This is difficult but necessary. We know if we make one compromise, we will be pressured to make more compromises.\u201d</p> <p>It is fair to say this approach is not appreciated by everyone. His company have had people storming the stage and defacing their posters. They\u2019ve angered war veterans and there have been threats. Several of his premieres have required a police presence. \u201cBeyond the fear we feel from time to time, I think this is excellent grounds for theatre,\u201d he says. He believes that \u201ctheatre cannot and should not try to accommodate the interests of every group.\u201d If his work upsets fascists, nationalists and homophobes, he\u2019s fine with that.</p> <p>His latest \u2013 and perhaps most moving \u2013 play, In Five Seasons: An Enemy of the People, opened at the National Theatre (his work falls in and out of favour there depending on who\u2019s in charge). The play tackles the unchecked illegal construction that has seen the city of Pristina grow rapidly in the years after the war. When one architect, Rexhep Luci, made an attempt to instil order, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/13/balkans\">he was killed</a>. After that, says Neziraj, \u201cno one dared confront the issue\u201d. Ibsen\u2019s Dr Stockmann, the man who takes a stand, at great personal and professional cost, by exposing the contamination of the spa water in his town in An Enemy of the People, felt like an obvious parallel. Like many of his plays, the production was directed by Neziraj\u2019s wife, Blerta, one of the country\u2019s leading directors. They have a good working relationship, he says, though as opening night approaches, things can become tense as \u201cdiscussions move from the theatre to the dinner table\u201d.</p> <p>Kosovo is the youngest country in Europe, though its statehood is not recognised by all countries (Spain, Russia and, of course, Serbia are among the countries that do not), which means obtaining visas is laborious and financially prohibitive \u2013 or, as Neziraj puts it: \u201cHell, hell, hell.\u201d This makes touring difficult and inevitably results in cultural isolation. But he won\u2019t let that deter him. Theatre, he says, is a vital tool of opposition. \u201cIt should challenge the official discourse that\u2019s promoted by the government and the media. Theatre has that potential.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Department of Dreams is at <a href=\"https://citygarage.org/\">City Garage, Los Angeles</a>, until 8 December.</p></li> </ul>",

Political adverts on social media If you have seen any political content on social media that does not clearly state who has paid for it we want you to let us know. Political adverts on Facebook should state clearly who has paid for them in their posts. However, commercial adverts do not say who who is paying for them, but show only that they are sponsored. Which platform did you see it on? Which political party was it for? If it did not have a disclosure on it what was the reason the platform gave for showing you the advert? Though adverts will be banned from Twitter on 22 November, we would be interested to know if you see any posted after this date. Send your screenshots to us on WhatsApp by clicking here or via our form here. Have you experienced issues with polling stations? Is your primary school having to forgo its nativity play? Has the church had to reschedule its festivities? Or are there other issues you are experiencing? Tell us here what is happening where you are. Where do you get your election news from?

      "bodyText": "Over the course of the general election campaign, Guardian reporters will be spending significant amounts of time in constituencies across the country to report on the local currents that will shape the national future. We would like to find out what issues matter to voters on the ground, so if you live in any of the constituencies we\u2019re reporting from, tell us what you think. We will be updating the following list of places we are visiting during the election campaign. Belfast East Traditionally a unionist seat, Belfast East is facing deep political uncertainty. It\u2019s held by the DUP which supports Brexit but is not happy with Boris Johnson\u2019s deal in case it weakens Northern Ireland\u2019s position in the UK. Several pro-remain parties such as Sinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP and the Greens have stepped aside in the constituency to give Naomi Long, leader of the centrist Alliance party, a chance at winning the seat. So this election will also be a test of whether the Alliance can rally enough voters who have previously voted along unionist or nationalist lines. Let us know what issues will decide your vote here. Bishop Auckland Bishop Auckland, apart from a brief hiatus in the 1930s, has voted Labour for over a century. But it also voted by a big margin for Brexit. Will lifelong Labour voters who voted leave turn to the Conservative Party to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, as Boris Johnson hopes? Or will the Brexit Party split the leave vote? If the Tories are to win a majority they must win northern towns like this, where Labour\u2019s Helen Goodman has a majority of just 502. If you live in Bishop Auckland, you can share your views with us here. Camborne and Redruth Camborne, Redruth and Hayle make up an urban area, pockets of which are ranked among the most deprived in the country. The constituency also has a rural spread. It voted Leave in the EU referendum. Employment, affordable housing and social isolation are among concerns highlighted in the area. Conservative George Eustice has held the seat since it was created in 2010. In 2017 he saw his majority reduced from 7,004 to 1,577. Labour now sees it within grasp, and will be hoping it provides a breakthrough in Cornwall where all six constituencies are currently Conservative. We would like to know what factors are key to determining your vote. What are the local issues? And will they trump Brexit and national politics at the ballot box? Tell us what you think by here. Canterbury Are you a young voter in Canterbury? The Guardian is reporting on the battle in one of the most interesting constituencies in the country, which showed the unexpected strength of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party in the 2017 election. Two years later, we\u2019re keen to hear from voters in the Kent city about their views on the election. We\u2019re particularly interested in hearing from young people and students who were crucial in helping Labour win the historically Tory seat in 2017. Are the young people in Canterbury who swung the election last time still motivated or are they split? With the decline of Facebook, how are volunteers and organisers from the main parties getting their message across online? Let us know what you think here. Chingford and Woodford Green The constituency has been represented by Iain Duncan Smith for 27 years, but his majority has fallen sharply and the Labour candidate Faiza Shaheen hopes to oust him by focusing on the cuts he helped implement as a Tory minister. Will the contest be driven by the legacy of austerity? Or will Brexit, which divided this area almost 50:50, dominate this election too? We\u2019d like to understand the big issues facing you and your family and which policies matter to you. If you live in the constituency tell us about your views here. Cities of London and Westminster In the constituency of Cities of London and Westminster, which ranges from wealthy neighbourhoods such as Mayfair and Belgravia to more socially mixed areas such as Soho, Paddington and Pimlico, issues range from homelessness, air quality and local development to the role of the Square Mile. If you live in the area, share your thoughts with us here. Darlington If you live in Darlington, how happy are you with the state of housing, work, community relations, policing and health services? Who has an impact on your community that we should meet? Are there issues in your family that create division? Are you thinking of switching your vote? Or perhaps you feel disengaged from national politics altogether. Get in touch with us here. Dudley North Dudley North is the fourth most marginal seat in the UK. In 2017 Labour\u2019s Ian Austin won by just 22 votes and the previous year 71% voted to leave the EU. This you would think would make it prime Brexit party territory however in the past few weeks there have been some surprises. Rupert Lowe, the West Midlands MEP and former chairman of Southampton football club, announced he would no longer be standing for Farage\u2019s party. Meanwhile, Austin, who was the Labour MP for the constituency for 14 years dramatically quit the party in February, telling voters to support the Conservatives in the election instead as he believed Jeremy Corbyn was \u201ccompletely unfit\u201d to be prime minister. We\u2019re keen to hear from voters in Dudley North about their views on the election. We\u2019re particularly interested in hearing from people who feel that Dudley North may have been a target for a far right movement? Whether people in the area feel an affinity with the Brexit party and/or the EDL? Anyone that has experienced any far right racism or come across any far right political rallying? Let us know what you think here. Glasgow North East Glasgow North East is a key Labour-SNP marginal, which has twice changed hands in the last two general elections. It has some of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK, with amongst the lowest life expectancy rates. Given how popular the SNP is in Scotland overall, this seat is a key test of whether Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s anti-austerity platform can cut through. If you live in Glasgow North East, can you tell us what will decide your vote? We\u2019d like to understand the big issues facing you and your family and which policies matter to you. How happy are you with the state of housing, work, community relations, policing and health services? Share your views here. Morecombe and Lunesdale The seat is considered a bellwether and has been Conservative throughout its history, except for during the Tony Blair years, with the Tories winning by a 1,399 majority in 2017. There is great wealth but also significant poverty. There is a higher proportion of young people not in education, employment or training than local averages. We\u2019re particularly interested in hearing from people who live or work in Heysham, a large coastal village that has huge strategic importance for the north-west. It is home to two nuclear power stations and a port, a major distribution hub between the UK and Ireland, which will be affected significantly by Brexit. Share your views with us here. Norwich North In Norwich North, Conservative MP Chloe Smith\u2019s majority was trimmed to just 507 over Labour in 2017. Smith, who won the seat from Labour during a byelection in 2009, would have lost had every Green party voter (or Lib Dem) backed Labour. Norwich has a reputation for being one of the country\u2019s most environmentally-minded cities. The Green party\u2019s nine city councillors make it the second-largest party after Labour on the council. The Norwich South MP, Labour\u2019s Clive Lewis, was the co-author with the Greens\u2019 Caroline Lucas of the Green New Deal bill. The city has lost hundreds of manufacturing jobs this year, with factories closing including local icon Colman\u2019s (the mustard-makers), a print works and, in Norwich North, an electric heater manufacturer. Patrick is particularly interested in hearing from Norwich North residents who have lost their jobs, and finding out how their experiences are shaping their political views and voting intentions. Does Labour\u2019s version of a Green New Deal offer them any hope? You can get in touch with us here. Peterborough The Guardian will be reporting from Peterborough, where people have seen public spending fall by \u00a3262 a year per person since the start of austerity in 2010 \u2013 typical of the UK as a whole. We\u2019d also like to know how you following this election whether traditional media such as TV and newspapers or online news sites or social media. Do you belong to local Facebook or WhatsApp groups? If you live in Peterborough, let us know about the issues affecting you here. St Albans St Albans is a prosperous constituency, with a historic cathedral town at its heart, which regularly pops up near the top of lists of \u2018best places to live in the UK\u2019. It has been mostly Conservative voting for decades, although it was captured by Labour in 1945, and New Labour for two terms from 1997. Now it is a major target for the Liberal Democrats. They hope to capitalise on the fact it is heavily remain backing and its incumbent MP Anne Main is a hardline leaver, who narrowly survived a deselection attempt in 2009 after an expenses row. To win the seat in this election the Liberal Democrat candidate, Daisy Cooper will need to take votes from both the two main parties to overturn a 6000 strong majority. Share your views here. Southampton Itchen In Southampton Itchen, the Conservative Royston Smith is defending one of the smallest majorities in the UK, just 31 votes ahead of Labour. Will the contest be dominated by Brexit or more local issues? We are keen to hear from you about what your concerns and priorities are. Southampton Itchen is one of the constituencies where the student vote could make a big difference. If you are a student in Southampton, we\u2019d like to understand the big issues which concern you and which policies matter to you. How do you feel about tuition fees, student debt and the high cost of living in student accommodation? We\u2019d also like to hear from voters in the constituency who\u2019re not students, what are the important national and local issues that will decide your vote? Share your views here. Stevenage The Guardian\u2019s Gary Younge will be covering the election from Stevenage for two main reasons. First, he grew up there and second, it is a classical bellwether constituency. For almost half a century Stevenage has always voted for whichever party became the government. If you live in Stevenage, can you tell us what will decide your vote?

      "body": "<p>Forty years ago this month, Flowers in the Attic, the debut novel of one VC Andrews was published. A review in the Washington Post didn\u2019t mince its words, describing it as \u201cderanged swill\u201d that \u201cmay well be the worst book I have ever read\u201d.</p> <p>The plot is nothing if not deranged \u2013 but even 40 years later, utterly compelling. Cathy and Chris Dollanganger and their little brother and sister, Cory and Carrie, are beautiful, blond-haired and as happy as can be until their handsome father dies. Their destitute mother tells them that in order to regain the fortune from which she has been disinherited, they must hide in their grandparents\u2019 vast attic for a few days so she can persuade their grandfather to reinstate her as his heir.</p> <p>They end up trapped in the attic for more than three years, where poisoned doughnuts kill off one of them, and where the overheated drama somehow leads Chris to rape his sister \u2013 but it\u2019s fine, says Cathy, \u201cyou didn\u2019t rape me. I could have stopped you if I\u2019d really wanted to.\u201d Somehow, the incestuous teenagers acquire a romantic tinge: can Chris and Cathy escape, and will they make it as a couple despite everything that\u2019s against them?</p> <p>That \u201cderanged swill\u201d proved irresistible. Andrews\u2019 gothic tale of incest, poisoning and dark family secrets has sold more than 40m copies. There have been two film adaptations and a stage play, as well as sequels, prequels and retellings penned by both Andrews and Andrew Neiderman, the ghostwriter who took on Andews\u2019 mantle after her death.

Its editor, Ann Patty, <a href=\"https://the-toast.net/2013/08/12/planting-flowers/\">has written </a>of how on first encountering it, she stayed up \u201cuntil 2am, reading it in one long gulp\u201d. She told her friend, a literary agent who had described it to her as \u201cawful and fabulous\u201d, that it was \u201csome sort of brilliant\u201d.</p> <p>Once the book was published in November 1979 with that iconic cutout jacket, readers quickly agreed. \u201cI remember when Flowers first came out \u2013 teenagers everywhere were reading it and the more press it received about being \u2018scandalous\u2019 or \u2018shocking\u2019 only piqued interest, until it became a worldwide phenomenon,\u201d says Jen Long, who now edits the VC Andrews franchise. \u201cI think readers root for the children in general. We want them to escape and find their place in the world, where they never have to eat a powdered doughnut again.\u201d</p> <p>Patty and publisher Pocket Books realised they needed a sequel, and fast. Patty <a href=\"https://the-toast.net/2013/08/12/planting-flowers/\">recounts in the Toast</a> how she flew to Virginia to meet Andrews for the first time and discovered that she was in a wheelchair, \u201cher blonde hair was carefully coiffed around her pale, flawless skin, her atrophied legs capped by pink slippers. Her blue eyes were wary.\u201d</p> <p>Born Cleo Virginia Andrews, the author was known as VC Andrews in the US to appeal to a male audience. (In the UK, she has always been Virginia.) The myths around her were myriad. A<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/obituaries/vc-andrews-novelist-dies-wrote-of-families-dark-side.html\"> New York Times obituary</a> said that she \u201ckept her age secret, [and] was believed to be in her late 40s or early 50s when she died\u201d.<a href=\"https://people.com/archive/have-you-read-a-best-selling-gothic-lately-chances-are-it-was-by-a-recluse-named-v-c-andrews-vol-14-no-14/\"> A People magazine profile in 1980</a> said that she \u201cspent most of her life as an invalid in her Portsmouth, Virginia home, the victim of progressive arthritis\u201d, standing at her desk to write. Andrews herself, <a href=\"https://www.completevca.com/art_fear.shtml\">in a 1985 interview with the writer Douglas E Winter</a>, said that her handicap began when she was \u201ccoming downstairs at school when my heel caught on something, and I fell forward and twisted to catch the banister. Later, the doctors found that the twist had been very violent, and that it tore the membrane on my hip and started little bone spurs.</p> <p>\u201cA newspaper once said that I was \u2018paralysed\u2019. It made me really angry, because I am not paralysed. They think that if you are in a wheelchair, you are paralysed, or else you would be up on your feet. And I do walk; but since they don\u2019t see me walk, they don\u2019t think I can,\u201d she told Winter.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The most terrible things about my childhood probably were those that I created in my mind</p> <footer> <cite>Virginia Andrews</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As an adult Andrews lived with her mother, to whom she dedicated her novel featuring one of the most dastardly fictional mothers ever written. As per her pitch, Andrews always claimed that her story drew from <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kateaurthur/the-ghost-of-vc-andrews-the-life-death-and-afterlife-of-the\">the life story of one of her doctors</a>, not her own.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people think I was tortured, but my parents didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she told Winter. \u201cThe most terrible things about my childhood probably were those that I created [in] my mind because my childhood was so ordinary, and I wanted it to be more exciting.\u201d</p> <p>When Patty first met Andrews in her wheelchair, the author served her a plate of powdered sugar doughnuts as a nod to her murder plot. The pair discussed a potential sequel about Cathy and Chris. \u201cVirginia had a wicked sense of humour, and we took turns throwing out plot ideas, devising new miseries for the children to face in the outside world \u2013 illness, suicide, obsessive love, sexual transgression, and madness.\u201d </p> <p>Petals in the Wind came out in 1980, followed by If There Be Thorns (1981) and Seeds of Yesterday (1984). Andrews took a step away from the Dollanganger series to tell the \u2013 possibly even more deranged \u2013 story of My Sweet Audrina (1982), about a girl whose family is haunted by the rape and murder of her mysterious older sister. It was her only standalone novel and a bestseller. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a61dc875571b686da3cfe4dd7f312f0dd764f64d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a61dc875571b686da3cfe4dd7f312f0dd764f64d/0_0_3837_5755/667.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Neiderman.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was almost like I was possessed\u2019 \u2026 Andrew Neiderman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon &amp; Schuster</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andrews died in 1986 of breast cancer. That same year Neiderman, whose books under his own name include hit The Devil\u2019s Advocate, was approached by Andrews\u2019 agent Anita Diamant. He had never read Andrews, but his wife was a fan. He had also been a high-school teacher so \u201cwas familiar with teenage girls\u201d. When Diamant asked him to finish the Flowers in the Attic prequel Garden of Shadows, Neiderman said yes.</p> <p>He began by analysing Andrews\u2019 style. \u201cIn effect I was doing a research paper,\u201d he says now. \u201cFirst I looked at the syntax, the sentence structure. There were what I call VC-isms \u2013 she had her own way of describing things. I began to understand what she was doing with characters, how she\u2019d get at them, their relations to their families.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the premises in VC Andrews novels, he believes, that make them work. \u201cImagine going into a movie studio and you say to the producers, \u2018I\u2019ve got a movie here about a mother who locks her children in the attic for three years and three months.\u2019 The premise is what catches people\u2019s interest so fast. In Heaven, for example, it\u2019s the story of a father who sells his children,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s intrigued by why people who are supposed to love each other hurt each other so much. When you get into all the motivations, the emotions, the jealousies, the problems between mothers and daughters, fathers and sons \u2013 you\u2019re getting biblical if you think about it. Whenever there\u2019s family, there\u2019s going to be tension. To be able to see it, visualise it, understand it, is part of what makes VC Andrews so powerful.\u201d</p> <p>Garden of Shadows was another hit and Neiderman went on writing Andrews novels. For a time, he says, he\u2019d write his own books on a different computer. \u201cOften I was writing two novels at once, a thriller under my name and a VC Andrews novel,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the early days when I used two computers, I would turn my chair around \u2013 it was almost like I was possessed.\u201d</p> <p>In 1990, with the publication of Dawn, a letter to readers revealed that \u201cwe have been working closely with a carefully selected writer to organise and complete Virginia\u2019s stories and to expand upon them by creating additional novels inspired by her wonderful storytelling genius\u201d. It was only in 1994, <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/850/1279/2132381/\">when the Andrews estate sued the Internal Revenue Service</a> over taxes and Neiderman was a major witness, that it became clear to her fans for the first time that he was now Andrews.</p> <p>The case helpfully lays out the precise appeal of Andrews\u2019 books. \u201cEach was written in the first person and featured, as its principal character, a teenager, generally female, who was failed, and in some way hurt, by an adult family member with a warped personality. In each, the protagonist overcame the adversities visited upon her or him and, at the end of the novel, faced a hopeful future.\u201d</p> <p>More than 30 years on and around 80 books later, Neiderman is still writing as Andrews, including a stage play of Flowers in the Attic and a new prequel \u2013 the first of a new trilogy \u2013 which follows the children\u2019s great-grandmother Corrine Dixon. His name still doesn\u2019t appear on the novels, aside from a reference to the \u201ccarefully selected writer\u201d. He is, however, named online, both on <a href=\"http://www.simonandschusterpublishing.com/vcandrews/about-the-author.html\">publisher Simon &amp; Schuster\u2019s site</a>, and his own, where he says that he \u201chas brought the [VC Andrews] franchise from 30 million to over 106 million worldwide in 95 countries\u201d. The secret isn\u2019t a secret any more \u2013 although it\u2019s hardly publicised.</p> <p>A question mark remains over how much of the content is based on what she left behind. A rare interview with Andrews in 1981 stated that \u201cthe author, who is given to hyperbole, reports that she has 63 brief synopses of future novels tucked away\u201d. Neiderman himself says he had text to work with for Garden of Shadows, \u201cbut most of it was inspired by things I saw in her writing\u201d.</p> <p>For now, Neiderman is writing three VC Andrews books a year. It takes him four months to write one, and he says he\u2019s still enjoying it. \u201cI get a passion for a premise. When I wrote about Satan coming to Earth and being a lawyer [in The Devil\u2019s Advocate], that grabbed me and I loved writing about it. Some VC Andrews books have really seized me, like The Mirror Sisters, two identical twins where obviously the sibling rivalries are going to be really strong, that worked up into a nice series of books,\u201d he says. \u201cOr Celeste, about a mother who raises her daughter as a boy when the daughter\u2019s brother dies on the farm, you have the whole sexual identity thing. I love those premises and from there you go on.\u201d</p> <p>But he\u2019s not sure he has another 80 books in him. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve 126 published novels already \u2026 [But] I work every day and enjoy it, it\u2019s still fun for me.\u201d</p>",

Once the book was published in November 1979 with that iconic cutout jacket, readers quickly agreed. \u201cI remember when Flowers first came out \u2013 teenagers everywhere were reading it and the more press it received about being \u2018scandalous\u2019 or \u2018shocking\u2019 only piqued interest, until it became a worldwide phenomenon,\u201d says Jen Long, who now edits the VC Andrews franchise. \u201cI think readers root for the children in general. We want them to escape and find their place in the world, where they never have to eat a powdered doughnut again.\u201d Patty and publisher Pocket Books realised they needed a sequel, and fast. Patty recounts in the Toast how she flew to Virginia to meet Andrews for the first time and discovered that she was in a wheelchair, \u201cher blonde hair was carefully coiffed around her pale, flawless skin, her atrophied legs capped by pink slippers. Her blue eyes were wary.\u201d Born Cleo Virginia Andrews, the author was known as VC Andrews in the US to appeal to a male audience. (In the UK, she has always been Virginia.) The myths around her were myriad. A New York Times obituary said that she \u201ckept her age secret, [and] was believed to be in her late 40s or early 50s when she died\u201d. A People magazine profile in 1980 said that she \u201cspent most of her life as an invalid in her Portsmouth, Virginia home, the victim of progressive arthritis\u201d, standing at her desk to write. Andrews herself, in a 1985 interview with the writer Douglas E Winter, said that her handicap began when she was \u201ccoming downstairs at school when my heel caught on something, and I fell forward and twisted to catch the banister. Later, the doctors found that the twist had been very violent, and that it tore the membrane on my hip and started little bone spurs. \u201cA newspaper once said that I was \u2018paralysed\u2019. It made me really angry, because I am not paralysed. They think that if you are in a wheelchair, you are paralysed, or else you would be up on your feet. And I do walk; but since they don\u2019t see me walk, they don\u2019t think I can,\u201d she told Winter. As an adult Andrews lived with her mother, to whom she dedicated her novel featuring one of the most dastardly fictional mothers ever written. As per her pitch, Andrews always claimed that her story drew from the life story of one of her doctors, not her own. \u201cA lot of people think I was tortured, but my parents didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she told Winter. \u201cThe most terrible things about my childhood probably were those that I created [in] my mind because my childhood was so ordinary, and I wanted it to be more exciting.\u201d When Patty first met Andrews in her wheelchair, the author served her a plate of powdered sugar doughnuts as a nod to her murder plot. The pair discussed a potential sequel about Cathy and Chris. \u201cVirginia had a wicked sense of humour, and we took turns throwing out plot ideas, devising new miseries for the children to face in the outside world \u2013 illness, suicide, obsessive love, sexual transgression, and madness.\u201d Petals in the Wind came out in 1980, followed by If There Be Thorns (1981) and Seeds of Yesterday (1984). Andrews took a step away from the Dollanganger series to tell the \u2013 possibly even more deranged \u2013 story of My Sweet Audrina (1982), about a girl whose family is haunted by the rape and murder of her mysterious older sister. It was her only standalone novel and a bestseller. Andrews died in 1986 of breast cancer. That same year Neiderman, whose books under his own name include hit The Devil\u2019s Advocate, was approached by Andrews\u2019 agent Anita Diamant. He had never read Andrews, but his wife was a fan. He had also been a high-school teacher so \u201cwas familiar with teenage girls\u201d. When Diamant asked him to finish the Flowers in the Attic prequel Garden of Shadows, Neiderman said yes. He began by analysing Andrews\u2019 style. \u201cIn effect I was doing a research paper,\u201d he says now. \u201cFirst I looked at the syntax, the sentence structure. There were what I call VC-isms \u2013 she had her own way of describing things. I began to understand what she was doing with characters, how she\u2019d get at them, their relations to their families.\u201d It\u2019s the premises in VC Andrews novels, he believes, that make them work. \u201cImagine going into a movie studio and you say to the producers, \u2018I\u2019ve got a movie here about a mother who locks her children in the attic for three years and three months.\u2019 The premise is what catches people\u2019s interest so fast. In Heaven, for example, it\u2019s the story of a father who sells his children,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s intrigued by why people who are supposed to love each other hurt each other so much. When you get into all the motivations, the emotions, the jealousies, the problems between mothers and daughters, fathers and sons \u2013 you\u2019re getting biblical if you think about it. Whenever there\u2019s family, there\u2019s going to be tension. To be able to see it, visualise it, understand it, is part of what makes VC Andrews so powerful.\u201d Garden of Shadows was another hit and Neiderman went on writing Andrews novels. For a time, he says, he\u2019d write his own books on a different computer. \u201cOften I was writing two novels at once, a thriller under my name and a VC Andrews novel,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the early days when I used two computers, I would turn my chair around \u2013 it was almost like I was possessed.\u201d In 1990, with the publication of Dawn, a letter to readers revealed that \u201cwe have been working closely with a carefully selected writer to organise and complete Virginia\u2019s stories and to expand upon them by creating additional novels inspired by her wonderful storytelling genius\u201d. It was only in 1994, when the Andrews estate sued the Internal Revenue Service over taxes and Neiderman was a major witness, that it became clear to her fans for the first time that he was now Andrews. The case helpfully lays out the precise appeal of Andrews\u2019 books. \u201cEach was written in the first person and featured, as its principal character, a teenager, generally female, who was failed, and in some way hurt, by an adult family member with a warped personality. In each, the protagonist overcame the adversities visited upon her or him and, at the end of the novel, faced a hopeful future.\u201d More than 30 years on and around 80 books later, Neiderman is still writing as Andrews, including a stage play of Flowers in the Attic and a new prequel \u2013 the first of a new trilogy \u2013 which follows the children\u2019s great-grandmother Corrine Dixon. His name still doesn\u2019t appear on the novels, aside from a reference to the \u201ccarefully selected writer\u201d. He is, however, named online, both on publisher Simon &amp; Schuster\u2019s site, and his own, where he says that he \u201chas brought the [VC Andrews] franchise from 30 million to over 106 million worldwide in 95 countries\u201d. The secret isn\u2019t a secret any more \u2013 although it\u2019s hardly publicised. A question mark remains over how much of the content is based on what she left behind. A rare interview with Andrews in 1981 stated that \u201cthe author, who is given to hyperbole, reports that she has 63 brief synopses of future novels tucked away\u201d. Neiderman himself says he had text to work with for Garden of Shadows, \u201cbut most of it was inspired by things I saw in her writing\u201d. For now, Neiderman is writing three VC Andrews books a year. It takes him four months to write one, and he says he\u2019s still enjoying it. \u201cI get a passion for a premise. When I wrote about Satan coming to Earth and being a lawyer [in The Devil\u2019s Advocate], that grabbed me and I loved writing about it. Some VC Andrews books have really seized me, like The Mirror Sisters, two identical twins where obviously the sibling rivalries are going to be really strong, that worked up into a nice series of books,\u201d he says. \u201cOr Celeste, about a mother who raises her daughter as a boy when the daughter\u2019s brother dies on the farm, you have the whole sexual identity thing. I love those premises and from there you go on.\u201d But he\u2019s not sure he has another 80 books in him. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve 126 published novels already \u2026 [But] I work every day and enjoy it, it\u2019s still fun for me.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>This week the election campaign has been squarely focused on public finances, with the Conservatives publishing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/11/labour-spending-tories-young-voters\" title=\"\">widely derided \u00a31.2tn assessment</a> of Labour\u2019s spending plans. In spite of the debunking of these figures, the party has doubled down with a separate assessment of Labour\u2019s tax plans \u2013 it says Labour\u2019s spending plans outweigh how much it plans to collect in tax, leading to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/12/will-labour-plans-really-cost-each-taxpayer-2400\" title=\"\">\u00a32,400 per taxpayer \u201cgap\u201d</a> that will need to be filled by borrowing or raising taxes.</p> <p>Of course, the Conservatives are aware of the quality of the claims they are making. As a tactic, the \u00a31.2tn is straight out of the \u201c\u00a3350m a week\u201d playbook: come up with a big figure, and no matter if it\u2019s indefensible, wait for it to stick. The more your opponents complain, the more they end up repeating the big number until it\u2019s indelibly imprinted on voters\u2019 minds.</p> <p>Many of the figures presented to arrive at this big number are questionable. Labour has not yet agreed the policies in its manifesto and some of the spending and tax proposals included in these calculations, such as replacing council tax with a property tax, are not currently Labour policy. And where the calculations involve policies that have been previously announced, assumptions have been made in order to generate the largest possible estimate of their costs. </p> <p>Next are the presentational tricks. There can be good reasons to present figures aggregated to five-year totals: such as when setting an ambition for a parliament, for instance, or if you expect year-to-year fluctuations that are superficial rather than meaningful. But in this case, with no good reason to do it, presenting a five-year \u00a31.2tn figure looks a lot like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/labour-derides-12tn-tory-costing-claims-as-work-of-fiction-corbyn\" title=\"\">an attempt to inflate the number</a>. It\u2019s then even more misleading to compare this erroneous five-year figure to an annual figure for GDP, as the Conservatives went on to do. Even if we were to accept their costings, they would represent roughly 12% of GDP on an annual basis, not 60% as is claimed.</p> <p>Sajid Javid\u2019s assessment of Labour\u2019s tax plans that supposedly reveals a tax gap of \u00a32,400 per taxpayer is a poor way to present the likely impact on voters of increased spending. First, the Conservatives haven\u2019t taken into account any of the potential benefits of the policies, such as income from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/14/labour-plans-for-utilities-would-cost-the-uk-200bn-says-cbi\" title=\"\">nationalised utilities and rail</a>, which could recoup some of the upfront cost. We\u2019d also expect to see incomes \u2013 and therefore tax revenues \u2013 rise as a result of increased investment. But even if taxes did need to rise, thankfully we have a progressive tax and benefit system, which would spread the costs to those more able to pay. It is reasonable to assume that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/13/general-election-johnson-re-launches-tory-campaign-as-labour-unveils-nhs-plan-live-news?page=with:block-5dcbe68c8f08aab51e1be264#block-5dcbe68c8f08aab51e1be264\" title=\"\">the tax changes Labour might introduce</a> would also be progressive, given previous commitments. This means that while \u00a32,400 will look very worrying to a low-income voter, it\u2019s a tax bill they\u2019re unlikely to ever be presented with.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While we\u2019re all obsessing over the numbers, we lose sight of the questions that really matter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To ordinary people without the tools or time to decode policy costings, incomprehensibly large numbers start to become meaningless. So too do economic analyses: if these numbers can\u2019t be trusted, why should other numbers widely reported in the press be trusted either? Election antics such as these therefore damage the fabric of public debate, and as a consequence the strength of our democracy.</p> <p>They also direct public attention on to narrow and overly simplistic accounting rather than the economic questions that really matter. Economic policy is seen as no more than management of the public finances, with policies that we know really shape how the economy works and for whom it works \u2013 such as investment, industrial strategy and regulation \u2013 treated as secondary.</p> <p>Yet we know that it is fundamental reform of the economy that is urgently needed. Wages are only just recovering from their pre-recession peak and several regions in the country have been <a href=\"https://qz.com/1709904/which-uk-regions-have-had-a-recession-recently/\" title=\"\">in technical recession</a> since 2015. The UK has been near the bottom of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/blogs/uk-third-bottom-global-investment-league\" title=\"\">league table for investment</a> for 20 years \u2013 yet with the ongoing crises of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/30/half-of-job-growth-to-be-limited-to-london-inequality-inquiry-finds\" title=\"\">regional inequality</a> and climate breakdown, the country can no longer afford not to invest.</p> <p>But the Tories continue to paint the kind of investment required as an upfront cost deemed unaffordable. In fact, in the Conservatives\u2019 new fiscal rules and in the name of economic credibility, public investment would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/tories-and-labour-warned-over-ambitious-spending-promises-infrastructure-investment\" title=\"\">limited to 3% of national income</a> \u2013 below the level our OECD peers already invest and unlikely to be sufficient to meet the challenges we face as a society.</p> <p>This is austerity logic in action. George Osborne\u2019s legacy goes further than the unnecessary cuts imposed on public services and welfare budgets, to an obsession with upfront, direct policy costings as the only measure of economic credibility.

      "bodyText": "This week the election campaign has been squarely focused on public finances, with the Conservatives publishing a widely derided \u00a31.2tn assessment of Labour\u2019s spending plans. In spite of the debunking of these figures, the party has doubled down with a separate assessment of Labour\u2019s tax plans \u2013 it says Labour\u2019s spending plans outweigh how much it plans to collect in tax, leading to a \u00a32,400 per taxpayer \u201cgap\u201d that will need to be filled by borrowing or raising taxes. Of course, the Conservatives are aware of the quality of the claims they are making. As a tactic, the \u00a31.2tn is straight out of the \u201c\u00a3350m a week\u201d playbook: come up with a big figure, and no matter if it\u2019s indefensible, wait for it to stick. The more your opponents complain, the more they end up repeating the big number until it\u2019s indelibly imprinted on voters\u2019 minds. Many of the figures presented to arrive at this big number are questionable. Labour has not yet agreed the policies in its manifesto and some of the spending and tax proposals included in these calculations, such as replacing council tax with a property tax, are not currently Labour policy. And where the calculations involve policies that have been previously announced, assumptions have been made in order to generate the largest possible estimate of their costs. Next are the presentational tricks. There can be good reasons to present figures aggregated to five-year totals: such as when setting an ambition for a parliament, for instance, or if you expect year-to-year fluctuations that are superficial rather than meaningful. But in this case, with no good reason to do it, presenting a five-year \u00a31.2tn figure looks a lot like an attempt to inflate the number. It\u2019s then even more misleading to compare this erroneous five-year figure to an annual figure for GDP, as the Conservatives went on to do. Even if we were to accept their costings, they would represent roughly 12% of GDP on an annual basis, not 60% as is claimed. Sajid Javid\u2019s assessment of Labour\u2019s tax plans that supposedly reveals a tax gap of \u00a32,400 per taxpayer is a poor way to present the likely impact on voters of increased spending. First, the Conservatives haven\u2019t taken into account any of the potential benefits of the policies, such as income from nationalised utilities and rail, which could recoup some of the upfront cost. We\u2019d also expect to see incomes \u2013 and therefore tax revenues \u2013 rise as a result of increased investment. But even if taxes did need to rise, thankfully we have a progressive tax and benefit system, which would spread the costs to those more able to pay. It is reasonable to assume that the tax changes Labour might introduce would also be progressive, given previous commitments. This means that while \u00a32,400 will look very worrying to a low-income voter, it\u2019s a tax bill they\u2019re unlikely to ever be presented with. To ordinary people without the tools or time to decode policy costings, incomprehensibly large numbers start to become meaningless. So too do economic analyses: if these numbers can\u2019t be trusted, why should other numbers widely reported in the press be trusted either? Election antics such as these therefore damage the fabric of public debate, and as a consequence the strength of our democracy. They also direct public attention on to narrow and overly simplistic accounting rather than the economic questions that really matter. Economic policy is seen as no more than management of the public finances, with policies that we know really shape how the economy works and for whom it works \u2013 such as investment, industrial strategy and regulation \u2013 treated as secondary. Yet we know that it is fundamental reform of the economy that is urgently needed. Wages are only just recovering from their pre-recession peak and several regions in the country have been in technical recession since 2015. The UK has been near the bottom of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) league table for investment for 20 years \u2013 yet with the ongoing crises of regional inequality and climate breakdown, the country can no longer afford not to invest. But the Tories continue to paint the kind of investment required as an upfront cost deemed unaffordable. In fact, in the Conservatives\u2019 new fiscal rules and in the name of economic credibility, public investment would be limited to 3% of national income \u2013 below the level our OECD peers already invest and unlikely to be sufficient to meet the challenges we face as a society. This is austerity logic in action. George Osborne\u2019s legacy goes further than the unnecessary cuts imposed on public services and welfare budgets, to an obsession with upfront, direct policy costings as the only measure of economic credibility. Policy costings are presented as a \u201cneutral\u201d assessment, but are in fact deeply and opaquely politicised, and favour incremental policies with low upfront investment over potentially more effective, transformative policies. While we\u2019re all obsessing over the numbers, we lose sight of the questions that really matter. What determines affordability is where and how the money is used. We urgently need to repair the damage that has been done to public services and family incomes by austerity over the past decade, and to invest in the economy so that incomes \u2013 and consequently tax revenues \u2013 can grow. Rather than boiling down economics to a poorly executed accounting spreadsheet, we need to be focusing on how parties plan to fix the longstanding weaknesses of our economy and how they plan to avert catastrophic climate breakdown \u2013 so that we even have an economy to talk of in years to come.

      "body": "<p>The battle for American hearts and minds in the unfolding impeachment drama is, at its core, a battle between two very different California congressmen.</p> <p>In the red corner is Devin Nunes, a Republican former dairy farmer from the state\u2019s agricultural Central Valley, who long ago threw his lot in with Fox News talking-point orthodoxy and has never hesitated to defend Donald Trump, no matter how much the rest of the political establishment \u2013 and the factual record \u2013 was arrayed against him.</p> <p>In the blue corner is Adam Schiff, Democrat of Los Angeles, who in January took over Nunes\u2019s gavel as chair of the House intelligence committee, and has dug deep into his experience as a federal prosecutor to distill the complexities of a political intrigue spanning halfway around the globe into an easily digestible indictment of the president.</p> <p>As the two senior lawmakers on the intelligence committee, the pair has emerged as Trump\u2019s chief defender and chief nemesis, highly visible surrogates but also lightning rods of the broader political struggle. Both have earned lopsided quantities of praise from their own partisans and boundless scorn from the other side of the aisle.</p> <p>Their styles could not have contrasted more sharply than when they made their opening statements in the public impeachment hearings on Wednesday. Schiff was cool, forensic, quoting witness statements and established facts, outlining what he saw as the key questions before Congress and the American people.</p> <p>The outcome of the impeachment process, Schiff said, would affect \u201cnot only the future of this presidency but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander-in-chief\u201d.</p> <p>Nunes was indignant and blustery, sweat pricking at his brow as he reeled off a litany of supposed plots, conspiracies and low conniving by everyone except the person the members were there to investigate \u2013 the president of the United States.</p> <p>The Democrats, he charged, were \u201cthe last people on Earth with the credibility to hurl more preposterous accusations at their political opponents\u201d. They were waging a \u201cscorched-earth war\u201d in a \u201ccult-like atmosphere\u201d and putting witnesses through \u201cStar Chamber\u201d interrogations before deciding if they were fit for prime-time exposure.</p> <p>On the key question of whether Trump had pressured Ukraine into providing political dirt for his re-election campaign, however, Nunes remained largely silent.</p> <p>In some ways, Schiff and Nunes are acting as one would expect lawyers to act in a courtroom, seizing the best arguments at their disposal and running with them. Schiff has close to a cast-iron case that Trump did indeed demand political favors from Ukraine in exchange for US military aid and other vital forms of assistance; the only real question is whether they amount to the \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d required by the constitution to justify removing a president mid-term.</p> <p>Without such an advantage, Nunes is instead seeking to undermine the credibility of the people making the case against Trump, to question the reasons why the impeachment process began at all, and to muddy up the factual record with dark hints of Democratic party plots, collusion with key witnesses and outright deception.</p> <p>But beyond this tussle for the rhetorical upper hand lies a deeper and more consequential issue: whether Congress is capable of exercising its constitutional independence as a check on executive power, as it ultimately did <a href=\"https://www.legbranch.org/2018-4-25-when-congress-won-the-american-peoples-respect-watergate/\">during the Watergate scandal</a>, or whether partisanship in 2019 has devolved to a point where party interest reigns supreme and nothing else \u2013 not even the sale of America\u2019s foreign policy for political favors \u2013 really matters.</p> <p>Long before Trump entered the political scene, Nunes had a reputation as someone willing to toe the party line without question. As chair of the intelligence committee from 2015-2019, he was part of a years-long (and ultimately unsuccessful) quest for evidence of wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in the lead-up to the deadly 2012 attack on a US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.</p> <p>After Trump came into office, Nunes made it his job to protect Trump at all costs against allegations that his campaign had welcomed or even colluded with Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Nunes rejected the unanimous conclusions of the intelligence services \u2013 over whom he was charged with exercising oversight \u2013 that Russia had indeed interfered.

      "bodyText": "The battle for American hearts and minds in the unfolding impeachment drama is, at its core, a battle between two very different California congressmen. In the red corner is Devin Nunes, a Republican former dairy farmer from the state\u2019s agricultural Central Valley, who long ago threw his lot in with Fox News talking-point orthodoxy and has never hesitated to defend Donald Trump, no matter how much the rest of the political establishment \u2013 and the factual record \u2013 was arrayed against him. In the blue corner is Adam Schiff, Democrat of Los Angeles, who in January took over Nunes\u2019s gavel as chair of the House intelligence committee, and has dug deep into his experience as a federal prosecutor to distill the complexities of a political intrigue spanning halfway around the globe into an easily digestible indictment of the president. As the two senior lawmakers on the intelligence committee, the pair has emerged as Trump\u2019s chief defender and chief nemesis, highly visible surrogates but also lightning rods of the broader political struggle. Both have earned lopsided quantities of praise from their own partisans and boundless scorn from the other side of the aisle. Their styles could not have contrasted more sharply than when they made their opening statements in the public impeachment hearings on Wednesday. Schiff was cool, forensic, quoting witness statements and established facts, outlining what he saw as the key questions before Congress and the American people. The outcome of the impeachment process, Schiff said, would affect \u201cnot only the future of this presidency but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander-in-chief\u201d. Nunes was indignant and blustery, sweat pricking at his brow as he reeled off a litany of supposed plots, conspiracies and low conniving by everyone except the person the members were there to investigate \u2013 the president of the United States. The Democrats, he charged, were \u201cthe last people on Earth with the credibility to hurl more preposterous accusations at their political opponents\u201d. They were waging a \u201cscorched-earth war\u201d in a \u201ccult-like atmosphere\u201d and putting witnesses through \u201cStar Chamber\u201d interrogations before deciding if they were fit for prime-time exposure. On the key question of whether Trump had pressured Ukraine into providing political dirt for his re-election campaign, however, Nunes remained largely silent. In some ways, Schiff and Nunes are acting as one would expect lawyers to act in a courtroom, seizing the best arguments at their disposal and running with them. Schiff has close to a cast-iron case that Trump did indeed demand political favors from Ukraine in exchange for US military aid and other vital forms of assistance; the only real question is whether they amount to the \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d required by the constitution to justify removing a president mid-term. Without such an advantage, Nunes is instead seeking to undermine the credibility of the people making the case against Trump, to question the reasons why the impeachment process began at all, and to muddy up the factual record with dark hints of Democratic party plots, collusion with key witnesses and outright deception. But beyond this tussle for the rhetorical upper hand lies a deeper and more consequential issue: whether Congress is capable of exercising its constitutional independence as a check on executive power, as it ultimately did during the Watergate scandal, or whether partisanship in 2019 has devolved to a point where party interest reigns supreme and nothing else \u2013 not even the sale of America\u2019s foreign policy for political favors \u2013 really matters. Long before Trump entered the political scene, Nunes had a reputation as someone willing to toe the party line without question. As chair of the intelligence committee from 2015-2019, he was part of a years-long (and ultimately unsuccessful) quest for evidence of wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in the lead-up to the deadly 2012 attack on a US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. After Trump came into office, Nunes made it his job to protect Trump at all costs against allegations that his campaign had welcomed or even colluded with Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Nunes rejected the unanimous conclusions of the intelligence services \u2013 over whom he was charged with exercising oversight \u2013 that Russia had indeed interfered. And he made a notorious cloak-and-dagger trip to the White House to accuse those same intelligence services of mounting a deep-state espionage operation against Trump and his allies. (The charges he made did not stick.) Not only did Nunes clear Trump of any collusion with Russia; he turned right around and started investigating the FBI\u2019s reasons for opening the investigation in the first place, thus feeding straight into the sort of deep-state conspiracies beloved of Fox News hosts and Trump\u2019s inner circle. Other Republicans, fearful of the Trump-supporting party base, followed him some of the way along this path but he was one of the very few to go so far, and so publicly. Senior Democrats \u2013 not Schiff \u2013 began referring to Nunes as \u201cTrump\u2019s stooge\u201d and \u201cTrump\u2019s fixer\u201d. And when Schiff pushed back, he came in for his own typically Trumpian form of abuse. One tweet, memorably, called him \u201clittle Adam Schitt\u201d. Schiff has played a principal role in the House\u2019s investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, the subject of Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. He\u2019s been more reluctant than some of his more gung-ho fellow Democrats to call for the impeachment of the president and came around only when Nancy Pelosi, the equally reluctant speaker, concluded that the Ukraine affair was too grave to overlook. What the New York Times has described as Schiff\u2019s \u201cmore-in-sorrow-than-in-anger tone\u201d has been a big part of his appeal across all parts of his party. The darkest interpretation of the standoff is that Nunes is part of an attempt by Trump and his supporters to destroy the very notion of investigative fact and replace it with a series of partisan talking points \u2013 that the investigation is a \u201csham\u201d, that Schiff should himself be investigated, that Trump\u2019s call in which he openly asked the Ukrainian president to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d by investigating Hunter Biden was \u201cperfect\u201d, and so on. Another way of looking at it, though, is through opinion polls that suggest the case for impeachment is growing stronger, not weaker, with the American public. The CNN political analyst Brian Stelter put it this way on Wednesday: \u201cSchiff is trying to speak to the entire country.

The conference, which began on Tuesday, has attracted opposition from anti-choice groups, who held their own events in the city. More than 100,000 people have signed a petition to reject \u201cthe pro-abortion and sexualisation agenda at [the] ICPD+25 Nairobi summit\u201d. A \u201cpro-life and pro-family march\u201d, organised by the Kenya Christian Professional Forum and planned for Thursday, was postponed by police for security reasons. \u201cThey [organisers] never allowed us, the pro-life and pro-family people, inside the ICPD25 summit.

The list of demands included full access to information, means and support for any woman who wants an abortion, guaranteed universal health coverage, bodily autonomy, and a recognition that access to the full range of sexual and reproductive health and rights \u201cis the bedrock of gender equality\u201d. The statement also called for the recognition of sexual rights as human rights, the protection of refugees, urgent action to address the climate crisis and more money for feminist, LGBT and disability groups. The call to action specifically recognised the rights of adolescents \u2013 particularly girls, transgender, and gender non-confirming adolescents \u2013 to access the information, programmes and services they need to control their bodies. \u201cThough we\u2019ve made significant progress since Cairo, for too many, the promise of ICPD remains unfulfilled,\u201d said the authors of the call to action, which include the Asian-Pacific Resource and Research Centre on Women, Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era, Fiji Grassroots Feminist Network, International Women\u2019s Health Coalition, and Realizing Sexual and Reproductive Justice. \u201cWe must go further and be bolder in our demands. The time is now to commit to a new agenda that recognises intersecting forms of discrimination and offers actionable and sustainable solutions to achieve gender equality.\u201d",

The raids in London also led to the rescue of 29 women, aged 20 to 40, who were believed to be victims of trafficking and have been taken to a place of safety, according to the Metropolitan police. Those detained, who are aged between 17 and 50 and include three women, were held on suspicion of modern slavery, controlling prostitution, class A drug offences and firearm offences relating to a stun gun. A man was also arrested in the Romanian city of Constanta as police there executed warrants at the same time as British police were doing so at addresses in Redbridge, Havering, Barking and Dagenham, Newham, Brentwood and Tower Hamlets. DCI Richard McDonagh, from the Met\u2019s modern slavery and kidnap unit, said the synchronised operations had the aim of dismantling an organised crime network \u201cin one fell swoop\u201d and providing support to the victims. \u201cThe Met recognises the seriousness of modern slavery and the devastation it brings to people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an investigative capability across frontline policing and have invested in specialist resources through our central specialist crime \u2013 vulnerability investigations team, which tackles complex cases. This allows us to target offenders and support victims.\u201d The arrests were part of the latter stages of an international investigation known as Operation Kelang, involving Scotland Yard, the Crown Prosecution Service, Romanian police and prosecutors, the Romanian embassy, Europol and Eurojust, the European Union agency dealing with judicial cooperation. It was also supported by several charities and groups helping the victims of modern slavery, including the domestic violence charity Refuge and the Church of England. Romanian police officers were on the ground in Britain during the raids as part of a cooperation that included a Romanian police attache at the country\u2019s UK embassy. Dan Mihalache, the Romanian ambassador in the UK, said: \u201cRomanian police officers working shoulder to shoulder with our British partners is a great achievement, a proof of our mutual permanent support and a great professional reward. \u201cThe Romanian police is committed to continue its efforts in combating all forms of criminality together with the Metropolitan police.\u201d The operation comes after a call for urgent reform by the former anti-slavery commissioner Kevin Hyland, who said Britain\u2019s system for preventing people-trafficking into the country was failing. Hyland said last month that the UK was still failing to treat human trafficking as a serious organised crime, and the country viewed it instead primarily as a \u201csocial issue\u201d, he said. Although the Modern Slavery Act of 2015 was \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d, insufficient resources had been allocated to investigating the trafficking networks. He was critical of some of the government\u2019s recent anti-slavery initiatives, such as lighting buildings including 10 Downing Street and the Home Office up with red floodlights to mark Anti-Slavery Day.",

      "body": "<p>There is no more quintessentially stale, pale and dusty Englishman than Dr Samuel Johnson, committed Tory and devout Anglican. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography calls him \u201cthe most distinguished man of letters in English history\u201d for his essays, criticism and fiction. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/25/100-best-nonfiction-books-no-86-a-dictionary-of-the-english-language-by-samuel-johnson-1755\" title=\"\">Dictionary of the English Language</a> (1755), with its 40,000 entries, set the standard for all subsequent dictionaries. But who reads him any more? Even university students struggle with Johnson\u2019s essays, which are mostly about other dead white men, such as Shakespeare.</p> <p>Traditionalists might decry Dr Johnson as another victim of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/20/academics-its-time-to-get-behind-decolonising-the-curriculum\" title=\"\">decolonising the curriculum</a> in favour of BAME writers, but many have probably not even read him. They are even less likely to have read his translation of the 17th-century Portuguese Jesuit Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo\u2019s Voyage to Abyssinia (1735). Equally neglected is his one and only stage play, Irene (1749), on the doomed relationship between an Ottoman sultan and Greek prisoner set in Istanbul, inspired by his interest in translating Lobo\u2019s account of the religion and politics of the Habesha people of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Both reveal an interest in and sympathy with people and places a world away from the elite gentlemen\u2019s clubs and political debates of Georgian England.</p> <p>Increasingly the classroom is just one of many spaces to challenge traditional assumptions about figures such as Johnson and his inaccessible writing. In his case, an urban accident of geographical proximity has led to a reassessment of Irene beyond the seminar room. The house where Johnson lived and wrote his dictionary is today a museum. It sits in a central London square opposite the Arab British Centre, an organisation dedicated to understanding the Arab world and its history in the UK.</p> <p>Both institutions teamed up to launch an exhibition this month entitled London\u2019s Theatre of the East. It includes an exhibition in Dr Johnson\u2019s house of Arab-British artists responding to the long history of Arabs and Muslims in England and on its stage from Shakespeare to Johnson\u2019s Irene. They include the Palestinian-Irish playwright Hannah Khalil\u2019s dramatic monologue about the wife of the printer who published the first English translation of the Qur\u2019an in 1649. The British-Moroccan novelist Saeida Rouass is cutting up Johnson\u2019s Irene and his dictionary with Arab accounts of British life to create a startling composite text. Other artists will also be on display in the exhibition, alongside the first public performance of Johnson\u2019s Irene in 270 years.</p> <p>The time has come to reassess Johnson\u2019s neglected play. When it opened at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane in 1749 it only ran for nine nights. The problem lay in the play\u2019s central story of the Ottoman sultan, Mehmed the Conqueror (or \u201cMahomet\u201d in Johnson\u2019s play), and his relationship with Irene, a Greek Christian captured after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Using a trope common to the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, the apocryphal story portrays Mehmed as a violent oriental despot, crazed with lust, who publicly beheads the hapless Irene once he realises his passion for her threatens to undermine his political authority.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Decolonising Dr Johnson doesn\u2019t consign him to the rubbish heap of dead white writers: on the contrary, it returns him to a more diverse English literary culture</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Johnson\u2019s version of the story, Irene and her friend Aspasia debate their public and religious roles as women, rather than just their passions. Irene tells Mahomet that women share with men thought, wit and reasons, and she dies because of the decisions she makes, not because she is simply a pawn in a male world. Mahomet in turn is shown in a state of emotional turmoil at his conflicted situation, rather than as the raging Turk of the Elizabethan stage.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s collaborator, David Garrick, demanded the play was altered for performance, with Mahomet portrayed in melodramatic fashion and Irene killed onstage. This led to booing and laughter on the play\u2019s premiere and a hasty decision to return to Johnson\u2019s original version, with Irene dying offstage. Johnson tried to challenge prevailing beliefs about oriental drama, especially the assumption that its female characters were passive, complicit victims. It was this challenge, as much as the mannered language and static staging, that led to its critical and theatrical neglect.</p> <p>The performance at Dr Johnson\u2019s house restores Johnson\u2019s more compassionate and contradictory depictions of Irene and Mahomet. This will never redeem the play as a lost classic. But it does allow new audiences drawn from across black, Asian and minority ethnic communities to engage with this icon of white English culture writing about their own history, however garbled it may be. Alongside Johnson purists, they may see that there is no national or cultural purity to what is called English literature, or even language. The culture and history of Abyssinia and the Ottoman empire were important ingredients imported into Johnson\u2019s life and works, and we diminish his achievements if they are ignored.</p> <p>Decolonising Dr Johnson doesn\u2019t consign him to the rubbish heap of dead white writers: on the contrary, it returns him centrestage to a more diverse English literary culture. Decolonising the English curriculum as well as, in this case, its stage allows all of \u201cus\u201d \u2013 black, Asian, Muslim and white Britons \u2013 to be part of a conversation about Johnson and his literary legacy. It also deepens our understanding of Johnson and his writings, rather than diminishing or even dismissing them. Yes, he was a political and religious conservative, but he was also a passionate abolitionist who identified with outsiders based on his own life of mental and physical ill health.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd4dc64202875bb86e98f57c264d346c6690176d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd4dc64202875bb86e98f57c264d346c6690176d/0_219_5976_3588/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel Johnson, Portrait by J Reynolds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Johnson tried to challenge prevailing beliefs about oriental drama, especially the assumption that its female characters were passive, complicit victims.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: World History Archive/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To read Johnson\u2019s translations and watch his one and only play drawn from other cultures and traditions from outside the English-speaking world is to see that national purity in language and literature is always a dangerous myth created after the fact.

      "bodyText": "There is no more quintessentially stale, pale and dusty Englishman than Dr Samuel Johnson, committed Tory and devout Anglican. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography calls him \u201cthe most distinguished man of letters in English history\u201d for his essays, criticism and fiction. His Dictionary of the English Language (1755), with its 40,000 entries, set the standard for all subsequent dictionaries. But who reads him any more? Even university students struggle with Johnson\u2019s essays, which are mostly about other dead white men, such as Shakespeare. Traditionalists might decry Dr Johnson as another victim of decolonising the curriculum in favour of BAME writers, but many have probably not even read him. They are even less likely to have read his translation of the 17th-century Portuguese Jesuit Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo\u2019s Voyage to Abyssinia (1735). Equally neglected is his one and only stage play, Irene (1749), on the doomed relationship between an Ottoman sultan and Greek prisoner set in Istanbul, inspired by his interest in translating Lobo\u2019s account of the religion and politics of the Habesha people of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Both reveal an interest in and sympathy with people and places a world away from the elite gentlemen\u2019s clubs and political debates of Georgian England. Increasingly the classroom is just one of many spaces to challenge traditional assumptions about figures such as Johnson and his inaccessible writing. In his case, an urban accident of geographical proximity has led to a reassessment of Irene beyond the seminar room. The house where Johnson lived and wrote his dictionary is today a museum. It sits in a central London square opposite the Arab British Centre, an organisation dedicated to understanding the Arab world and its history in the UK. Both institutions teamed up to launch an exhibition this month entitled London\u2019s Theatre of the East. It includes an exhibition in Dr Johnson\u2019s house of Arab-British artists responding to the long history of Arabs and Muslims in England and on its stage from Shakespeare to Johnson\u2019s Irene. They include the Palestinian-Irish playwright Hannah Khalil\u2019s dramatic monologue about the wife of the printer who published the first English translation of the Qur\u2019an in 1649. The British-Moroccan novelist Saeida Rouass is cutting up Johnson\u2019s Irene and his dictionary with Arab accounts of British life to create a startling composite text. Other artists will also be on display in the exhibition, alongside the first public performance of Johnson\u2019s Irene in 270 years. The time has come to reassess Johnson\u2019s neglected play. When it opened at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane in 1749 it only ran for nine nights. The problem lay in the play\u2019s central story of the Ottoman sultan, Mehmed the Conqueror (or \u201cMahomet\u201d in Johnson\u2019s play), and his relationship with Irene, a Greek Christian captured after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Using a trope common to the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, the apocryphal story portrays Mehmed as a violent oriental despot, crazed with lust, who publicly beheads the hapless Irene once he realises his passion for her threatens to undermine his political authority. In Johnson\u2019s version of the story, Irene and her friend Aspasia debate their public and religious roles as women, rather than just their passions. Irene tells Mahomet that women share with men thought, wit and reasons, and she dies because of the decisions she makes, not because she is simply a pawn in a male world. Mahomet in turn is shown in a state of emotional turmoil at his conflicted situation, rather than as the raging Turk of the Elizabethan stage. Johnson\u2019s collaborator, David Garrick, demanded the play was altered for performance, with Mahomet portrayed in melodramatic fashion and Irene killed onstage. This led to booing and laughter on the play\u2019s premiere and a hasty decision to return to Johnson\u2019s original version, with Irene dying offstage. Johnson tried to challenge prevailing beliefs about oriental drama, especially the assumption that its female characters were passive, complicit victims. It was this challenge, as much as the mannered language and static staging, that led to its critical and theatrical neglect. The performance at Dr Johnson\u2019s house restores Johnson\u2019s more compassionate and contradictory depictions of Irene and Mahomet. This will never redeem the play as a lost classic. But it does allow new audiences drawn from across black, Asian and minority ethnic communities to engage with this icon of white English culture writing about their own history, however garbled it may be. Alongside Johnson purists, they may see that there is no national or cultural purity to what is called English literature, or even language. The culture and history of Abyssinia and the Ottoman empire were important ingredients imported into Johnson\u2019s life and works, and we diminish his achievements if they are ignored. Decolonising Dr Johnson doesn\u2019t consign him to the rubbish heap of dead white writers: on the contrary, it returns him centrestage to a more diverse English literary culture. Decolonising the English curriculum as well as, in this case, its stage allows all of \u201cus\u201d \u2013 black, Asian, Muslim and white Britons \u2013 to be part of a conversation about Johnson and his literary legacy. It also deepens our understanding of Johnson and his writings, rather than diminishing or even dismissing them. Yes, he was a political and religious conservative, but he was also a passionate abolitionist who identified with outsiders based on his own life of mental and physical ill health. To read Johnson\u2019s translations and watch his one and only play drawn from other cultures and traditions from outside the English-speaking world is to see that national purity in language and literature is always a dangerous myth created after the fact. Johnson knew it in writing his dictionary and Irene, and that is part of his complicated legacy. It seems appropriate that another individual associated with his legacy will also be looking down on the performance of Irene later this month. A portrait of Francis Barber, Johnson\u2019s servant and heir, still hangs in Dr Johnson\u2019s house. Barber helped revise Johnson\u2019s dictionary and advised James Boswell in writing the biography of Johnson. Francis Barber: born a slave in Jamaica, who married a white woman, opened a draper\u2019s shop in Staffordshire, and whose heirs are still among us. It is our problem \u2013 and challenge \u2013 to address Barber\u2019s heritage of slavery and forcible removal that also enabled us to have the version of Dr Johnson that we do \u2013 dictionary, Irene and all. \u2022 Jerry Brotton is the author of This Orient Isle: Elizabethan England and the Islamic World.

      "bodyText": "Tuberculosis has killed more people than any other disease in history. Last year, 1.5 million people died from TB and 10 million more acquired it. A shocking one-quarter of the world\u2019s population is infected. That\u2019s not much better than 1993, when one-third of the world was infected and the World Health Organization declared TB a global emergency. We are losing the battle. Earlier this month, experts gathered in Hyderabad for the 50th Union World Conference on fighting the disease. When the first such gathering was held in 1867, TB was the leading cause of death in industrialised nations. Today, it still ranks in the top 10 worldwide. Why, despite all the progress in medicine and public health over the past 150 years, is TB still the most common and lethal of all infectious diseases? First, TB has a singular capacity for contagion. When someone with active TB coughs or sneezes, they launch respiratory droplets containing the bacteria into the air. These droplets can stay suspended for hours, turning shared spaces \u2013 homes, schools, public transport, hospital waiting rooms \u2013 into transmission hot spots. And unlike some diseases, such as measles, which can be caught only once, this \u201csmart\u201d pathogen can cause disease multiple times. But easy as TB is to catch, it is hard to diagnose. Once someone is infected, either the body\u2019s immune system defeats it, it becomes dormant (latent TB) or it develops into the active disease. The chief symptoms \u2013 cough, fever, and weight loss \u2013 come on slowly and are common to many other diseases. Most diagnostic tests are more than a century old and not very effective. Sputum microscopy has been used since Robert Koch discovered Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 1882. It only picks up half the cases of active TB. The skin, or Mantoux, test, also dating from the 19th century, which can detect latent TB, doesn\u2019t pick up anything for two months after exposure. Modern, more accurate tests are prohibitively expensive. Bacterial culture, the gold standard, takes weeks for results. False negatives or long waits delay getting people into treatment; when they are, it takes just 72 hours for them to stop being infectious. We need much better detection. And better methods for diagnosing younger children who may have to suffer their stomach contents being collected to mine swallowed sputum. Untreated, TB has a 70% fatality rate among HIV-negative people. Treated, that drops to 5%. But the shortest treatment takes six months, using drugs developed more than 50 years ago. Adverse side effects, out-of-pocket costs, and loss of work lead some people to stop treatment, contributing to the rise of drug-resistant strains. Drug-resistant TB requires treatment with second-line drugs that have seriously toxic side effects, such as hypothyroidism, hearing loss, skin pigmentation and kidney failure.

That is the closest they have come in recent times. The manager is Markku Kanerva and the captain, Tim Sparv, is a former Southampton midfielder. The two were in the same roles when the under-21s qualified for the European Championship a decade ago, something that has aided the partnership.</p> <p>Kanerva is relatively unknown outside his homeland, having spent the majority of his playing career in Finland and worked in the national setup for the last 15 years. \u201cHe\u2019s a former teacher, so he\u2019s very theoretical, so a calm presence in the dressing room,\u201d Sparv says. \u201cHe is very open and gives a lot of responsibility to the players, which suits us very well, and he wants our feedback and asks us if there is anything we want to change, so he\u2019s been really good for us. He\u2019s been in this environment for a long time, so he knows the players very well from the youth teams.\u201d</p> <p>Mutual respect between manager and players has built a strong bond in a squad who lack notable stars. Five of the players were part of the team who qualified for the 2009 European Under-21 Championship in Sweden and feel they can go where no other senior side have gone before. \u201cSometimes I say: \u2018The best players don\u2019t necessarily make the best team,\u2019\u201d Sparv says.</p> <p>\u201cThe golden generation of Finnish football of Jari Litmanen, Sami Hyypi\u00e4, Jussi J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen, Antti Niemi, Hannu Tihinen, Mikael Forssell [had] so many good players and everyone expected them to be the group who would qualify for a championship.

      "bodyText": "On Friday night in Helsinki it is unlikely to get above 5C for Liechtenstein\u2019s visit but Finland\u2019s players will be warmed by the prospect of qualifying for their first tournament. They have come close in the past but those packed into the 10,770-capacity stadium will be hoping to witness history. Those on the pitch are the least surprised about being 90 minutes from next summer\u2019s European Championship. They won their Nations League group, earning promotion, and the momentum has continued into qualification, meaning they need only beat Liechtenstein, who are yet to win in qualifying. Roy Hodgson managed a Finland side who missed out on Euro 2008 after drawing their final group game away to Portugal when victory was required. That is the closest they have come in recent times. The manager is Markku Kanerva and the captain, Tim Sparv, is a former Southampton midfielder. The two were in the same roles when the under-21s qualified for the European Championship a decade ago, something that has aided the partnership. Kanerva is relatively unknown outside his homeland, having spent the majority of his playing career in Finland and worked in the national setup for the last 15 years. \u201cHe\u2019s a former teacher, so he\u2019s very theoretical, so a calm presence in the dressing room,\u201d Sparv says. \u201cHe is very open and gives a lot of responsibility to the players, which suits us very well, and he wants our feedback and asks us if there is anything we want to change, so he\u2019s been really good for us. He\u2019s been in this environment for a long time, so he knows the players very well from the youth teams.\u201d Mutual respect between manager and players has built a strong bond in a squad who lack notable stars. Five of the players were part of the team who qualified for the 2009 European Under-21 Championship in Sweden and feel they can go where no other senior side have gone before. \u201cSometimes I say: \u2018The best players don\u2019t necessarily make the best team,\u2019\u201d Sparv says. \u201cThe golden generation of Finnish football of Jari Litmanen, Sami Hyypi\u00e4, Jussi J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen, Antti Niemi, Hannu Tihinen, Mikael Forssell [had] so many good players and everyone expected them to be the group who would qualify for a championship. They never made it and people were surprised they didn\u2019t. Maybe that has taken some pressure off our shoulders and we can just play.\u201d The Norwich City striker Teemu Pukki has scored seven of Finland\u2019s 12 goals in qualifying, helping them to five wins. The spine of the squad has been fleshed out with youngsters to create a disciplined team who have conceded only eight goals in as many games, earning five clean sheets in the process. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just one key element that improves us,\u201d Sparv says. \u201cWe have a coach and coaching staff who have created a really good environment for us to work in, a really safe environment for the younger players where they can take a few more risks on the pitch. \u201cWe usually have a very simple tactical plan: it\u2019s 4-4-2 where everybody knows their role, then we have some X factor in Pukki up front who has been scoring goals for fun these past few years.

      "body": "<p>For decades, you knew where you were with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/c-line-dion\">C\u00e9line Dion</a>. She belted out power ballads, she wowed the crowds in Vegas, she sold millions and millions of records. And she would never, ever be fashionable. There were no unexpectedly funky B-sides for DJs to dig out and confound the dancefloor with; no forgotten early concept album (bar an unreleased <a href=\"https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/arts/30-days-of-celine-dion-the-infamous-unreleased-phil-spector-tracks\">Phil Spector collaboration</a>) hinting at an intriguing musical path not subsequently followed. Dion seemed to have arrived pretty much as she remained: parked defiantly in the middle of the road, flicking the Vs \u2013 or whatever gesture the Qu\u00e9becois use to express disdain \u2013at passing trends. Indeed, Canadian critic Carl Wilson used her 1997 album Let\u2019s Talk About Love as the basis for <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/celine-dion-let-s-talk-about-love-9780826427885.html\">a book interrogating the meaning of so-called bad taste</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0887adba1287c94393f19ea67eee13c78521e5e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0887adba1287c94393f19ea67eee13c78521e5e7/0_0_500_500/500.jpg\" alt=\"C\u00e9line Dion: Courage album art work\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">C\u00e9line Dion: Courage album art work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then, the damnedest thing happened: C\u00e9line Dion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/21/celine-dion-review-o2-arena-london\">somehow became hip</a>. Rappers including Drake and Desiigner queued up to <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2017/05/22/celine-dion-at-the-billboard-music-awards\">have their photo taken with her</a> at the 2017 Billboard music awards. Lil Uzi Vert couldn\u2019t get a selfie but posted an Instagram video of himself and Machine Gun Kelly smoking a joint while Dion was on stage, and proclaimed her performance of My Heart Will Go On \u201cbeautiful\u201d. She was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jul/09/all-hail-celine-dion-the-joyous-new-queen-of-fashion\">the toast of this year\u2019s Paris fashion week</a>, snapped in a variety of mind-blowing couture outfits: at one juncture she appeared <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/lyapalater/celine-dion-on-a-scooter-that\">on an electric scooter</a> wearing a black bondage collar with silver spikes. Younger hit-makers are apparently desperate to work with her.

      "bodyText": "For decades, you knew where you were with C\u00e9line Dion. She belted out power ballads, she wowed the crowds in Vegas, she sold millions and millions of records. And she would never, ever be fashionable. There were no unexpectedly funky B-sides for DJs to dig out and confound the dancefloor with; no forgotten early concept album (bar an unreleased Phil Spector collaboration) hinting at an intriguing musical path not subsequently followed. Dion seemed to have arrived pretty much as she remained: parked defiantly in the middle of the road, flicking the Vs \u2013 or whatever gesture the Qu\u00e9becois use to express disdain \u2013at passing trends. Indeed, Canadian critic Carl Wilson used her 1997 album Let\u2019s Talk About Love as the basis for a book interrogating the meaning of so-called bad taste. And then, the damnedest thing happened: C\u00e9line Dion somehow became hip. Rappers including Drake and Desiigner queued up to have their photo taken with her at the 2017 Billboard music awards. Lil Uzi Vert couldn\u2019t get a selfie but posted an Instagram video of himself and Machine Gun Kelly smoking a joint while Dion was on stage, and proclaimed her performance of My Heart Will Go On \u201cbeautiful\u201d. She was the toast of this year\u2019s Paris fashion week, snapped in a variety of mind-blowing couture outfits: at one juncture she appeared on an electric scooter wearing a black bondage collar with silver spikes. Younger hit-makers are apparently desperate to work with her. Theories as to what has happened abound, ranging from public sympathy over the deaths of her husband and brother to nostalgia for the less complicated 1990s. The most prosaic explanation may be that millennials who grew up hearing their parents play her albums have them embedded in their psyches, the music you hear before you\u2019re old enough to make judgments about what\u2019s cool being notoriously hard to shake.

      "body": "<p>Some biographies are weighty, definitive tomes that add substantially to the sum of human knowledge; others are brisker accounts that condense the existing record into a digestible narrative. This new biography of the African American novelist, critic and playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesbaldwin\" title=\"\">James Baldwin</a> falls squarely in the latter category, but is well worth a read. It examines the trajectory of Baldwin\u2019s political thought on the interlocking questions of race, class and sexuality. At just under 200 pages, it is a smart and concise introduction to a writer whose trenchant insights into the nature of US politics and culture are as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/15/the-fire-this-time-legacy-of-james-baldwin\" title=\"\">relevant today</a> as they have ever been.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Baldwin laid the groundwork for what would come to be known as intersectional criticism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bill V Mullen sees Baldwin as something of a reluctant radical. Though he associated with communists in his youth, and his analysis of the historical plight of African Americans drew from Marxist political economy (\u201cwe have been functioning \u2026 for 400 years as a source of cheap labour\u201d), Baldwin had misgivings about the left. He noted with some bitterness that the discrimination routinely practised by many US trade unions made a mockery of the notion that black and white workers could find common cause in the labour movement. He had no truck with Soviet communism, advocating instead what Bobby Seale, the co-founder of the Black Panthers, called a \u201cYankee Doodle type socialism\u201d.</p> <p>Baldwin\u2019s early engagements with racial politics were similarly equivocal. He was sceptical about the Negritude movement of the 1950s, which sought to mobilise solidarity among the global African diaspora. Baldwin saw himself as a \u201cbastard of the west\u201d, shaped by his experience of western modernity; tethering himself to an imagined African identity would belie that reality. Likewise some of the rhetoric of black militancy \u2013 notably the racial separatism advocated by groups such as the Nation of Islam \u2013 jarred with him because it merely reproduced, in reverse, the logic of white supremacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"26ebe06037823f56835535d8740f4fd03ca907c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26ebe06037823f56835535d8740f4fd03ca907c1/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Public events pulled Baldwin out of his writer\u2019s isolation and into history.\u2019 Baldwin, right, at a memorial service for four girls killed in the bombing of an Alabama church, 1963.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Public events pulled Baldwin out of his writer\u2019s isolation and into history.\u2019 Baldwin, right, at a memorial service for four girls killed in the bombing of an Alabama church, 1963.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JH/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what changed? Public events, Mullen writes, \u201cpulled Baldwin out of his writer\u2019s isolation and into history\u201d. Ghana won its independence in 1957 and another 17 African countries followed suit in 1960.

      "bodyText": "Some biographies are weighty, definitive tomes that add substantially to the sum of human knowledge; others are brisker accounts that condense the existing record into a digestible narrative. This new biography of the African American novelist, critic and playwright James Baldwin falls squarely in the latter category, but is well worth a read. It examines the trajectory of Baldwin\u2019s political thought on the interlocking questions of race, class and sexuality. At just under 200 pages, it is a smart and concise introduction to a writer whose trenchant insights into the nature of US politics and culture are as relevant today as they have ever been. Bill V Mullen sees Baldwin as something of a reluctant radical. Though he associated with communists in his youth, and his analysis of the historical plight of African Americans drew from Marxist political economy (\u201cwe have been functioning \u2026 for 400 years as a source of cheap labour\u201d), Baldwin had misgivings about the left. He noted with some bitterness that the discrimination routinely practised by many US trade unions made a mockery of the notion that black and white workers could find common cause in the labour movement. He had no truck with Soviet communism, advocating instead what Bobby Seale, the co-founder of the Black Panthers, called a \u201cYankee Doodle type socialism\u201d. Baldwin\u2019s early engagements with racial politics were similarly equivocal. He was sceptical about the Negritude movement of the 1950s, which sought to mobilise solidarity among the global African diaspora. Baldwin saw himself as a \u201cbastard of the west\u201d, shaped by his experience of western modernity; tethering himself to an imagined African identity would belie that reality. Likewise some of the rhetoric of black militancy \u2013 notably the racial separatism advocated by groups such as the Nation of Islam \u2013 jarred with him because it merely reproduced, in reverse, the logic of white supremacy. So what changed? Public events, Mullen writes, \u201cpulled Baldwin out of his writer\u2019s isolation and into history\u201d. Ghana won its independence in 1957 and another 17 African countries followed suit in 1960. Baldwin believed this had a profound effect on how African Americans saw themselves and their place in the world. Reporting on a student march for racial equality in Tallahassee in 1960, he observed in the demonstrators a new and unprecedented assertiveness: \u201cThese students were born at the very moment at which Europe\u2019s domination of Africa was ending.\u201d Baldwin saw the Vietnam war as an extension of US discrimination against its black minority: \u201cA racist society can\u2019t but fight a racist war.\u201d Gradually, Mullen writes, \u201chis former life as an African-American dissident was reborn in the guise of a cosmopolitan internationalist\u201d. A decade riddled with white supremacist violence, culminating in the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968, made him increasingly sympathetic towards the politics of direct action \u2013 including the policy of armed self-defence championed by the Panthers. Mullen is a little harsh on Baldwin for not embracing LGBTQ activism more wholeheartedly. It is true that, when asked about the gay themes in his fiction, he tended to frame them in universal terms. He remarked that his second novel, Giovanni\u2019s Room, which has cult status in queer literary circles, was \u201cabout what happens when you\u2019re afraid to love anybody. Which is much more interesting than the question of homosexuality.\u201d Far from being a cop-out, however, Baldwin\u2019s willingness to draw on the gay experience to interrogate masculinity tout court was pioneering.

His independence of thought is perhaps nowhere more evident than in his literary criticism, where he combined a small-c conservative intellectual rigour with an unerring sense of moral justice. He sniped at the excesses of high modernism, declaring: \u201cI can see no virtue in art divorced from life or art which distorts and negates it.\u201d At the same time, however, he took issue with the so-called \u201cprotest novel\u201d, asking pointedly whether \u201cits power as a corrective social force is sufficient to override its deficiencies as literature\u201d, and insisting that dogmatic and sentimental social realism does a disservice to \u201cthe unpredictability and the occasional and amazing splendour of the human being\u201d.

He\u2019s identified with a city that people thought would be the death of him.

      "bodyText": "Diego Maradona tears a piece of paper, then again, until it is in shreds. On a screen opposite, the team he manages are minutes from victory in the first leg of a final tie \u2013 yet his stare is within. Maradona has been sent off for arguing with the fourth official, needlessly but because he cares \u2013 passionately. \u201cI told him there was an elbow to the head,\u201d he reflects aloud. \u201cThe San Lu\u00eds trainer told me to shut my mouth. I said: \u2018Really? Do you know how many games I\u2019ve played?\u2019 I\u2019m not perfect. No one\u2019s perfect. Sometimes I\u2019m confronted by things I can\u2019t control. But be clear: I\u2019m a good man. I want to improve football, for the good of people.\u201d This is the opening scene to a seven-part series, Maradona in Mexico, launched on Netflix this week, following Diego\u2019s year as manager of Dorados de Sinaloa of the Mexican second division. The team is based in Culiac\u00e1n, fortress of the Sinaloa cartel of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, jailed in the US. A bizarre circumstance, given that which made Diego almost as infamous as his wizardry at football made him famous \u2013 cocaine. \u201cIt was too crazy to be true,\u201d says the series director, Angus Macqueen. \u201cMaradona, a coke addict, going to the world capital of cocaine.\u201d But, as the club\u2019s assistant press officer Oyc\u00e9 Leal says, welcoming Diego at a charity dinner: \u201cWhen we heard Maradona was coming, everyone thought the obvious would happen, regarding the city\u2019s reputation for organised crime, drug trafficking and Diego\u2019s past history but he\u2019s turned out to be completely different. He\u2019s identified with a city that people thought would be the death of him. Culiac\u00e1n is rescuing Maradona in an unimaginable way.\u201d Just as he rescued the team, taking them from bottom of the league to an epic challenge for promotion. In his speech, Maradona responds: \u201cThey said I only came here for a holiday. No, I came to get us promoted. But my footballing commitment here is not only about the ball. It\u2019s about people who are in need, who\u2019ve also lost many things.\u201d Diego found a home of sorts in Culiac\u00e1n \u2013 not because of its cocaine industry but because of the resilience of people who live with its ravages. So the films are about football, but not; \u201cabout states of emotion\u201d, Macqueen says, \u201cin someone who expresses emotion with such clarity\u201d. They are about Maradona but also a marvellous supporting cast of players, radio commentators and club officials, markedly the president, Antonio Nu\u00f1ez, whose dream was to \u201cmake it that when you googled Culiac\u00e1n, the Dorados would come above Chapo Guzm\u00e1n\u201d. For that to happen, he solicited Maradona, got him \u201cand all that signifies\u201d. And crucially: the cast of citizens in a city that only two weeks ago was locked down by units of cartel gunmen after the army seized Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s son Ovidio, before being outgunned and releasing him. Also a city of families at the funfair, teenagers in discos \u2013 and fans watching football. There\u2019s been much noise around Asif Kapadia\u2019s feature on Maradona, and there will be more if it is nominated for an Oscar. Kapadia scores the open goal of assembling a riveting video scrapbook but tells little about Maradona\u2019s inner world, less about his time in Naples we didn\u2019t know 27 years ago, or what happened since and damn-all about football: it\u2019s like a film on Jimi Hendrix dying of drugs that ignores how he played the guitar. By contrast, these films explore real-life Diego: fervent, complex, charming, impassioned, sentimental and endearingly unhinged. For someone \u2013 which I am \u2013 who watched Maradona every other Sunday in Naples for two years, drop-jawed, it\u2019s this footage from Mexico that achieves riveting insight, eyeball-to-eyeball. We observe not only Maradona\u2019s magnetism and mania, his presence and resonance, but also occult insight into football itself. Kapadia is about how the mafia devoured Maradona the footballer \u2013 we know that; this is about how Maradona the manager ignored the mafia and forged a football team. There are priceless vignettes: Maradona\u2019s likeness as a birthday cake, into which the players plunge his face; \u201cyou are my family,\u201d he beams, covered in icing. During training he scores from the goalline, curving the ball; he can still do it, and is poignantly rapturous. But never more ecstatic than when watching a Boca Juniors victory on television. Diego confesses his dream is another chance to manage Argentina. Maradona rasps with the Buenos Aires barrio dialect he never lost, sadly smothered in an awful dubbed version \u2013 it\u2019s essential to see that in the original Spanish, subtitled. He waddles through the series with a spare tyre around his waist; he walks visibly in pain, from arthritis [for which he gobbles painkillers and undergoes plentiful physio]. Yet he\u2019s always dancing: with the players, a cumbia on the pitch with Ms Leal. [(Diego always wore his heart on his face, and his speech after defeat in the first final, kicking a drinks cooler, is histrionic catharsis: \u201cI\u2019m even angrier than you,\u201d he rants and weeps. \u201cThey can celebrate. Next year I want to stay with you if you want to stay with me. I love you all and I\u2019m grateful to all of you. You honoured the Dorados badge, proudly. You know what? This hurt me a lot. That\u2019s all.\u201d) During doldrums, when even the pitch becomes diseased, he is asked: \u201cDo you see it as part of your job to keep Dorados on the front pages, given your reputation?\u201d His reply: \u201cIf they don\u2019t talk about Maradona, what are they going to talk about? They\u2019ll talk about Trump, that rubber doll.\u201d Maradona trains Dorados with tactical insight, raw emotion and body language. He takes a desperate side and turns them into serious competition. He insists on \u201crhythm\u201d. \u201cDon\u2019t do it for Maradona,\u201d he urges before a game in Tijuana. \u201cDo it for football!\u201d But of course they are, palpably, \u201cdoing it\u201d for Diego, \u201cknowing that they, in Mexico\u2019s second division, have become part of the history of Maradona,\u201d Macqueen says. Maradona is self-aware from the start. Before a game in episode one, he is asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the hardest thing about being you?\u201d His response is visceral: \u201cThe most difficult thing is having people around all the time. People surrounding me. Though when I was ill, when I had my problem with drugs, I felt like the loneliest man on earth.\u201d Eleven months is enough time with Maradona to win trust and the confessional insights that come with it. In the penultimate episode there is confrontation with his failures, talking about his two daughters, Dalma and Giannina. \u201cThere\u2019s one person who saved me from the drugs,\u201d he says. \u201cGiannina Leonora Maradona, my youngest. She\u2019d grab the sheet and say: \u2018Dad!\u2019 But I was comatose. \u2018Dad, Dalma played with you. I want to play with you too!\u2019 I was in a coma. Even in the clinic, I was still thinking about drugs, and this tiny, dark skinned, beautiful thing, told me the right words: \u2018Daddy, play with me like you played with Dalma.\u2019\u201d The comic graphic title sequences and deployment of Mexican corrido songs give the series a jaunty touch; \u201clet\u2019s not take this too seriously\u201d, Macqueen says. But two serious rip-tides cut beneath the surface. One is about football as passe-partout, key to doors that would not otherwise open \u2013 and safe passage in dangerous places. We all know football starts conversations with taxi drivers and market-stall holders, wherever. But football has also saved my life on occasions, striking up the apposite conversation at gunpoint in war zones; football changes the subject, and people forget to kill you. More journalists are killed working in Mexico than in Syria but Macqueen and his long-time collaborator Guillermo Galdos can hang out with a camera in places where a journalist\u2019s every step is watched, only because they\u2019re making a film about football. Villa Ju\u00e1rez is a hotspot in Sinaloa\u2019s deadly internecine turf wars, whence midfielder Pedro Renter\u00eda comes, taking Macqueen\u2019s crew to watch boys kick about in the dust like he did, then a gunfight on his phone during which \u201cthe truck getting shot up was just over there by the red wall\u201d.

The city where they traffic the very substance that almost ended his life.\u201d Promotion from Mexico\u2019s second division to the top flight is decided in a \u201cfinalisima\u201d between the winners of two finals, each played at the end of the season\u2019s halves astride a Christmas break \u2013 called the Apertura and Clausura. During Maradona\u2019s Apertura and Clausura in Culiac\u00e1n, 2018-19, both finals were between his Dorados and San Lu\u00eds Potos\u00ed. It is not for me to reveal the outcome of the crucial second final \u2013 the tension is at times unbearable, not only for the viewer, but Diego, who during one game leaves the stands to which he has been banished after the sending-off, unable to take the suspense.",

      "body": "<p>Few things are certain in the American healthcare system \u2013 except for the paperwork. The tedious ritual of signing forms authorizing new providers to access our medical history is the result of a rarity for Americans: thanks to the first amendment, we have few rights and little expectation of privacy, except when it comes to our medical records. Even doctors who have our best interests at heart must get permission to access our data under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Hipaa).</p> <p>So it was truly shocking to learn this week that a business partnership between Google and Ascension, a major hospital chain and health insurer, has resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790\">transfer of 50 million Americans\u2019 most intimate medical records</a> to the Silicon Valley company, without the knowledge or consent of those 50 million patients. Even more alarming, the records are not de-identified, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/12/google-medical-data-project-nightingale-secret-transfer-us-health-information\">whistleblower disclosed to the Guardian</a> serious concerns about the program, including that individual staffers have downloaded patient records.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/07/uber-wework-\">Uber reported losses that would make WeWork blush \u2013 and that's the good news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It took less than 48 hours for federal regulators to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-googles-project-nightingale-a-health-data-gold-mine-of-50-million-patients-11573571867\">announce an investigation</a> into the partnership. Google and Ascension both claim that they are fully compliant with Hipaa, but there are few reasons for the public to trust them. The combination of a data-hungry advertiser and a cost-cut-seeking health insurer is truly dystopian. The fact that a whistleblower was disturbed enough to risk their job is alarming.</p> <p>One of the peculiarities of the backlash to big tech over the past few years has been the degree to which Google has remained unscathed despite engaging in behaviors similar to those that have left Facebook\u2019s reputation in tatters. I tend to believe that this is because Google\u2019s products are genuinely useful, making its surveillance of our online activities seem like a better bargain than Facebook\u2019s monopoly on our personal relationships, which often feels more like a hostage situation than an equal trade-off.</p> <p>But getting in bed with an industry that profits by denying healthcare \u2013 and doing so in a way that at the very least appears underhanded \u2013 could be a step too far for some customers.<strong> </strong></p> <h2>Feature?

      "bodyText": "Few things are certain in the American healthcare system \u2013 except for the paperwork. The tedious ritual of signing forms authorizing new providers to access our medical history is the result of a rarity for Americans: thanks to the first amendment, we have few rights and little expectation of privacy, except when it comes to our medical records. Even doctors who have our best interests at heart must get permission to access our data under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Hipaa). So it was truly shocking to learn this week that a business partnership between Google and Ascension, a major hospital chain and health insurer, has resulted in the transfer of 50 million Americans\u2019 most intimate medical records to the Silicon Valley company, without the knowledge or consent of those 50 million patients. Even more alarming, the records are not de-identified, and a whistleblower disclosed to the Guardian serious concerns about the program, including that individual staffers have downloaded patient records. It took less than 48 hours for federal regulators to announce an investigation into the partnership. Google and Ascension both claim that they are fully compliant with Hipaa, but there are few reasons for the public to trust them. The combination of a data-hungry advertiser and a cost-cut-seeking health insurer is truly dystopian. The fact that a whistleblower was disturbed enough to risk their job is alarming. One of the peculiarities of the backlash to big tech over the past few years has been the degree to which Google has remained unscathed despite engaging in behaviors similar to those that have left Facebook\u2019s reputation in tatters. I tend to believe that this is because Google\u2019s products are genuinely useful, making its surveillance of our online activities seem like a better bargain than Facebook\u2019s monopoly on our personal relationships, which often feels more like a hostage situation than an equal trade-off. But getting in bed with an industry that profits by denying healthcare \u2013 and doing so in a way that at the very least appears underhanded \u2013 could be a step too far for some customers.

Minneapolis opened a natural swimming pool in 2015; the same year, a natural pool was created by the river in Gothenburg, Sweden.</p> <p>What is behind the trend? \u201cI think it\u2019s a cultural thing \u2013 people are moving towards wanting products which are more natural, have less chemicals, look more aesthetically pleasing,\u201d says Evans, managing director of \u201cswimming pond\u201d company Gartenart. His firm has been involved with a proposal<a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/living/2019/05/22/a-new-floating-pool-on-the-thames-is-about-to-become-a-reality\"> to create a natural, heated public pool</a> in the middle of the River Thames that architecture firm Studio Octopi is behind \u2013 they are looking at a site in east London and are working with a developer, as well as investigating two other potential sites for additional pools.

Natural pools, if properly managed, \u201ccan be safe to use from a microbiological point of view [but] the risk is always going to be higher than in properly managed conventional pools\u201d.</p> <p>Another drawback to natural pools in cities is that they may not be able to serve large populations. \u201cYou cannot use natural pools as intensely as chlorinated pools,\u201d says Peter Petrich, director of Biotop, which has created many pools around the world. It built an open-air non-chlorinated pool in King\u2019s Cross, central London, in 2015, along with Slovenian artist Marjetica Potr\u010d and Ooze architects. It was conceived as a temporary living art installation but proved so popular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-swimming-blog/2016/oct/07/kings-cross-pond-club-is-this-the-end-for-city-centre-wild-swimming\">a petition was started</a> to keep it open, although it closed, as planned, in October 2016. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fce21ef2185e0fb852402630d71bcd5a63d77242\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fce21ef2185e0fb852402630d71bcd5a63d77242/0_167_5856_3514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The temporary open-air pool built in King\u2019s Cross, London, in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The temporary open-air pool built in King\u2019s Cross, London, in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The temporary open-air pool built in King\u2019s Cross, London, in 2015.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThere is a peacefulness you get from natural water that you don\u2019t get from sterilised water,\u201d says Tim Evans. As one of a growing number of people developing chemical-free swimming pools, he would say that \u2013 but he\u2019s far from alone. In recent years, fans of wild swimming have been almost evangelical about the restorative powers of propelling yourself through the silky, skin-pricklingly-cold water of seas, rivers and ponds. And now there are signs that British people are after a more natural experience from our swimming pools, too, after years of counting lengths in bright, heated leisure centres in water treated with chlorine. In summer 2021, a Georgian lido \u2013 Cleveland Pools \u2013 in Bath is due to reopen by the banks of the River Avon that will claim to be the world\u2019s first heated, non-chlorinated public swimming pool, its water treated with a filtration system rather than chemicals. Cleveland Pools, a 200-year-old Georgian lido in Bath, were originally fed by the neighbouring river next to it. The pools are currently being restored. Photographs: Matt Cardy/Getty Images/@multnomahmedia/Ben Birchall/PA Other cities have already embraced natural pools. In September, a chemical-free pool opened in Edmonton, Canada, on the site of old swimming baths, with its water cleaned by an extensive gravel filtration system. Minneapolis opened a natural swimming pool in 2015; the same year, a natural pool was created by the river in Gothenburg, Sweden. What is behind the trend? \u201cI think it\u2019s a cultural thing \u2013 people are moving towards wanting products which are more natural, have less chemicals, look more aesthetically pleasing,\u201d says Evans, managing director of \u201cswimming pond\u201d company Gartenart. His firm has been involved with a proposal to create a natural, heated public pool in the middle of the River Thames that architecture firm Studio Octopi is behind \u2013 they are looking at a site in east London and are working with a developer, as well as investigating two other potential sites for additional pools. There is a similar proposal in New York to create a \u2018self-filtering\u2019 floating pool on the East River. Another reason, says David Nettleton, managing director of Clear Water Revival, which is working on the Cleveland Pools project, is \u201cthe rising interest in renovating lidos at the moment\u201d. There is also, he says, a growing unease with pumping chemicals down the drains, as well as concern about the potential negative health effects of chlorine, including skin irritation.

Photograph: Jason Franson/The Canadian Press/PA Images From a public health perspective there are advantages to chlorine, which has been used to treat swimming pools for around a century (it was used to disinfect drinking water for the first time in 1897, in Maidstone, to stop a typhoid outbreak). A 2013 study by researchers at the University of Barcelona found that in three out of four natural pools in Catalonia they looked at, E. coli and faecal enterococci exceeded recommended limits. Pathogens such as viruses and bacteria can get into a pool in different ways such as faeces from animals and humans, either directly \u2013 such as bird droppings \u2013 or from runoff water after storms, or \u201cmicroorganisms associated with the skin or mucous membranes \u2013 eyes and mouth\u201d, says Arnau Casanovas-Massana, now an associate research scientist in epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health, and one of the authors of the study. An artist\u2019s impression of how the a proposed natural, heated public pool in the middle of the River Thames could look. Image: Studio Octopi/Picture Plane Ltd \u201cConventional pools containing chlorine are able to inactivate some of these pathogens, although not all. In natural swimming pools, we don\u2019t have that chemical disinfection, and thus the risk for those pathogens persisting in the water is higher.\u201d Good preventative measures should reduce the risk of potential pathogens entering the system, he says. Natural pools, if properly managed, \u201ccan be safe to use from a microbiological point of view [but] the risk is always going to be higher than in properly managed conventional pools\u201d. Another drawback to natural pools in cities is that they may not be able to serve large populations. \u201cYou cannot use natural pools as intensely as chlorinated pools,\u201d says Peter Petrich, director of Biotop, which has created many pools around the world. It built an open-air non-chlorinated pool in King\u2019s Cross, central London, in 2015, along with Slovenian artist Marjetica Potr\u010d and Ooze architects. It was conceived as a temporary living art installation but proved so popular a petition was started to keep it open, although it closed, as planned, in October 2016.

      "body": "<p>As party season approaches, so does the likelihood of waking up with a hangover \u2013 unless you don\u2019t drink, or you are one of those elegant types who can decline an offer of more wine without yelping: \u201cOh, go on then!\u201d a millisecond later.</p> <p>Obviously, we\u2019re still waiting for science to come up with a cure. Some swear by food or drink to sort themselves out. But which is best? We asked people who work with booze, from pub landlords to sommeliers.</p> <h2><strong>Crumpets</strong></h2> <p>Yes, really. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than a crumpet with butter on, if you\u2019re feeling a bit rough,\u201d says Hannah Thurman, manager of the Fox and Goose Inn in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire. Why? \u201cI just think because they\u2019re nice and warm and sort of fluffy.\u201d They\u2019re also gratifyingly unchallenging, she says. \u201cThey\u2019re not really complex \u2026 they\u2019re just really easy to eat.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Haggis</strong></h2> <p>By contrast, Andrew Pern, the chef-owner of the Star Inn at Harome, North Yorkshire, opts for \u201cextreme things\u201d that \u201ctest the body\u201d. One favourite is haggis with eggs. \u201cYou can buy haggis slices now, or mini haggis. Fry it off, fry the eggs, and that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t need any bread because it\u2019s fairly stodgy. Maybe a dash of HP sauce.\u201d So the logic is that if you can stomach haggis \u2013 offal and oats, traditionally encased in an animal\u2019s stomach \u2013 you\u2019re probably fine? \u201cYeah. Breakfast of kings.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4884d84a0da6c44c45403c5c8bb9ea01ec712933\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4884d84a0da6c44c45403c5c8bb9ea01ec712933/0_0_4794_3942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast of kings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"822\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Haggis ... breakfast of kings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: foodfolio/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Marmite</strong></h2> <p>Luca Dusi of the east London wine bar Passione Vino takes a similarly masochistic approach. \u201cWhen I have a hangover, what I\u2019m looking for is a kind of a punishment rather than something that makes me feel better straight away.\u201d Marmite fits the bill. \u201cI\u2019m not saying a gentle spread of 1.5g of Marmite on very buttery toast. No, no, no. A full teaspoon of it, straight into your mouth.\u201d You follow up with a couple of glasses of water and then \u2013 a tip Dusi picked up while working in Poland \u2013 the juice of pickled gherkins. Thanks to the large volume of liquid, Dusi says, \u201cit\u2019s either going to stay in or it\u2019s going to come up very quickly\u201d. Enjoy.</p> <h2><strong>French toast</strong></h2> <p>Maria Tamander, the landlady of the Cleveland Arms in Paddington, London, opts for \u201csoothing, filling\u201d French toast on days when leaving the house to shop for ingredients seems impossible. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a bit of stale bread, you don\u2019t even need to go out and buy fresh bread,\u201d she says. Hopefully, your cupboards will also be harbouring eggs, milk, salt and pepper. She combines them, soaks the bread in the mixture for a couple of minutes, and then fries it in salted butter.</p> <h2><strong>Bubbly</strong></h2> <p>The remedy for too much wine is more wine for Amy and Duncan Findlater, the owners of Smith &amp; Gertrude wine bar in Edinburgh.

      "bodyText": "As party season approaches, so does the likelihood of waking up with a hangover \u2013 unless you don\u2019t drink, or you are one of those elegant types who can decline an offer of more wine without yelping: \u201cOh, go on then!\u201d a millisecond later. Obviously, we\u2019re still waiting for science to come up with a cure. Some swear by food or drink to sort themselves out. But which is best? We asked people who work with booze, from pub landlords to sommeliers. Crumpets Yes, really. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than a crumpet with butter on, if you\u2019re feeling a bit rough,\u201d says Hannah Thurman, manager of the Fox and Goose Inn in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire. Why? \u201cI just think because they\u2019re nice and warm and sort of fluffy.\u201d They\u2019re also gratifyingly unchallenging, she says. \u201cThey\u2019re not really complex \u2026 they\u2019re just really easy to eat.\u201d Haggis By contrast, Andrew Pern, the chef-owner of the Star Inn at Harome, North Yorkshire, opts for \u201cextreme things\u201d that \u201ctest the body\u201d. One favourite is haggis with eggs. \u201cYou can buy haggis slices now, or mini haggis. Fry it off, fry the eggs, and that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t need any bread because it\u2019s fairly stodgy. Maybe a dash of HP sauce.\u201d So the logic is that if you can stomach haggis \u2013 offal and oats, traditionally encased in an animal\u2019s stomach \u2013 you\u2019re probably fine? \u201cYeah. Breakfast of kings.\u201d Marmite Luca Dusi of the east London wine bar Passione Vino takes a similarly masochistic approach. \u201cWhen I have a hangover, what I\u2019m looking for is a kind of a punishment rather than something that makes me feel better straight away.\u201d Marmite fits the bill. \u201cI\u2019m not saying a gentle spread of 1.5g of Marmite on very buttery toast. No, no, no. A full teaspoon of it, straight into your mouth.\u201d You follow up with a couple of glasses of water and then \u2013 a tip Dusi picked up while working in Poland \u2013 the juice of pickled gherkins. Thanks to the large volume of liquid, Dusi says, \u201cit\u2019s either going to stay in or it\u2019s going to come up very quickly\u201d. Enjoy. French toast Maria Tamander, the landlady of the Cleveland Arms in Paddington, London, opts for \u201csoothing, filling\u201d French toast on days when leaving the house to shop for ingredients seems impossible. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a bit of stale bread, you don\u2019t even need to go out and buy fresh bread,\u201d she says. Hopefully, your cupboards will also be harbouring eggs, milk, salt and pepper. She combines them, soaks the bread in the mixture for a couple of minutes, and then fries it in salted butter. Bubbly The remedy for too much wine is more wine for Amy and Duncan Findlater, the owners of Smith &amp; Gertrude wine bar in Edinburgh. They go for a sparkling shiraz from Australia\u2019s Barossa valley. The bubbles aren\u2019t of the \u201caggressive, in-your-face variety\u201d, but rather, Amy says, ones that will \u201clighten the pounding in your head\u201d.

This sadly is the bovine bedlam we\u2019re all committed to for the next 12 months of American politics.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a place where the best defense of Trump exhorting a foreign leader is that he was somehow rooting out corruption; where he was supposedly investigating foreign interference in the 2016 election when he was bribing a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election; where the FBI and CIA have undermined themselves; and where the Democrats have been colluding with the Russians.</p> \n<p>Nunes led the herd in arguing that this is a victimless crime \u2013 the Ukraine president got his stupid missiles anyhow. In fact Nunes was really arguing that impeachment is the criminal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/fox-news-impeachment-hearing-trump\">victimization of a poor helpless crusader</a> for truth, justice and good government, who happens to live in the people\u2019s house on Pennsylvania Avenue.</p> \n<p>By some miracle of telekinesis, Nunes\u2019s brain created a White House <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1194660405907464194\">video featuring our humble hero</a>, who insisted that his own impeachment wasn\u2019t all it seemed on live television.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on now is the single greatest scam in the history of American politics,\u201d said the real estate guy who is something of an expert in <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/trump-university-scam/\">scams</a>.</p> \n<p>Trump placed impeachment at the heart of the mother of all big government conspiracies involving Democrats taking away everyone\u2019s guns, healthcare, votes, freedom and judges.

These hearings are so darn complicated and foreign, maybe Americans will never remember whether <a href=\"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm/quotes/\">four legs are good or bad</a>.</p> \n<p>This is the latest in a long line of so-called defense strategies that have run the gamut from unlikely to unbelievable. First came the wild fabrications: Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was supposedly perfect, and the whistleblower doesn\u2019t exist. Then came the wild conspiracies: the Democrats were themselves fabricating evidence in secret hearings that somehow included Republicans. We spent an epoch or two debating Latin tit-for-tats. Now we have arrived at the stage of debate that involves hurling turds at a wall in the hope of finding something adhesive.</p> \n<p>As with most TV shows, the impeachment hearings are less about substance and more about style. The Democrats carefully cast as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/impeachment-hearings-public-william-taylor-george-kent\">their first witnesses</a> a pair of diplomats who seemed to have stepped out of a kinder, gentler era of American values.</p> \n<p>William Taylor, the US ambassador to Ukraine, is a Vietnam veteran who previously served in the same position under President George W Bush. Taylor looks like he was chiseled whole out of granite, and he tolerated no end of Republican stupidities with a stony certitude. It was frustratingly hard for Trump\u2019s allies to chip away at his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/trump-impeachment-inquiry-public-hearings-democrats-republicans\">central revelation</a> that Trump himself was personally interested only in the Bidens, not Ukraine.</p> \n<p>George Kent, a bow-tied foreign service official in charge of the entire European and Eurasian region, was so steadfastly committed to old-fashioned American democracy that he was happy to express his unease with Hunter Biden\u2019s business interests in Ukraine. Sadly for Trump, these good government types take a seriously dim view of a president corruptly using American military aid to manipulate American elections.</p> \n<p>The first day of the public impeachment hearings was not a fair fight. Against these diehard diplomats, the GOP relied on Jim Jordan, who just can\u2019t seem to shake off the stench of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/rep-jim-jordan-denies-he-ignored-report-ohio-state-doctor-n1080736\">sex abuse at Ohio State University</a>, where he used to coach wrestling.</p> \n<p>Then there was the flustered questioning from John Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican who was briefly Trump\u2019s nominee for director of national intelligence \u2013 until he was overwhelmed by his own problematic relationship with the truth on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/02/john-ratcliffe-trumps-intelligence-chief-pick-withdraws-amid-qualification-doubts\">his personal r</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/02/john-ratcliffe-trumps-intelligence-chief-pick-withdraws-amid-qualification-doubts\">\u00e9sum</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/02/john-ratcliffe-trumps-intelligence-chief-pick-withdraws-amid-qualification-doubts\">\u00e9</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cAre either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call?\u201d Ratcliffe barked at the two unimpeachable witnesses. \u201cShout it out \u2013 anyone?\u201d</p> \n<p>As Taylor tried to explain that it\u2019s for congressmen to answer, Ratcliffe withdrew his own question.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is your job,\u201d said Taylor, speaking on behalf of us all. If only Republican members of Congress understood the strange foreign language these career diplomats speak.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Richard Wolffe is a Guardian US columnist</p>",

Among the things Nunes wanted us never to forget was \u201cthem trying to obtain nude pictures of Trump from Russian pranksters who pretended to be Ukrainian officials\u201d and something about \u201cfabrications of Trump-Russia collusion from the Steele dossier\u201d. Thanks to Nunes, these nude Trump pictures are now seared into our collective minds. Lest we forget, when Nunes was actually running the intelligence committee, he used its resources to turn on the US\u2019s intelligence community for having the temerity to investigate Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. Less the cream of the cream, Nunes is more like the curd of the absurd. This sadly is the bovine bedlam we\u2019re all committed to for the next 12 months of American politics. It\u2019s a place where the best defense of Trump exhorting a foreign leader is that he was somehow rooting out corruption; where he was supposedly investigating foreign interference in the 2016 election when he was bribing a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election; where the FBI and CIA have undermined themselves; and where the Democrats have been colluding with the Russians. Nunes led the herd in arguing that this is a victimless crime \u2013 the Ukraine president got his stupid missiles anyhow. In fact Nunes was really arguing that impeachment is the criminal victimization of a poor helpless crusader for truth, justice and good government, who happens to live in the people\u2019s house on Pennsylvania Avenue. By some miracle of telekinesis, Nunes\u2019s brain created a White House video featuring our humble hero, who insisted that his own impeachment wasn\u2019t all it seemed on live television. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on now is the single greatest scam in the history of American politics,\u201d said the real estate guy who is something of an expert in scams. Trump placed impeachment at the heart of the mother of all big government conspiracies involving Democrats taking away everyone\u2019s guns, healthcare, votes, freedom and judges. The Democrats currently control the House of Representatives, which is an awesome branch of government, but not quite that awesome. \u201cIt\u2019s all very simple,\u201d said our very simple president. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to stop me because I\u2019m fighting for you.\u201d This may come as news for anyone who is not circling the barnyard. Trump was apparently fighting for regular Americans when he was extorting the Ukraine president to smear Joe Biden. Trump and Nunes are obviously hoping that voters cannot see through the fog on this farm. These hearings are so darn complicated and foreign, maybe Americans will never remember whether four legs are good or bad. This is the latest in a long line of so-called defense strategies that have run the gamut from unlikely to unbelievable. First came the wild fabrications: Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was supposedly perfect, and the whistleblower doesn\u2019t exist. Then came the wild conspiracies: the Democrats were themselves fabricating evidence in secret hearings that somehow included Republicans. We spent an epoch or two debating Latin tit-for-tats. Now we have arrived at the stage of debate that involves hurling turds at a wall in the hope of finding something adhesive. As with most TV shows, the impeachment hearings are less about substance and more about style. The Democrats carefully cast as their first witnesses a pair of diplomats who seemed to have stepped out of a kinder, gentler era of American values. William Taylor, the US ambassador to Ukraine, is a Vietnam veteran who previously served in the same position under President George W Bush. Taylor looks like he was chiseled whole out of granite, and he tolerated no end of Republican stupidities with a stony certitude. It was frustratingly hard for Trump\u2019s allies to chip away at his central revelation that Trump himself was personally interested only in the Bidens, not Ukraine. George Kent, a bow-tied foreign service official in charge of the entire European and Eurasian region, was so steadfastly committed to old-fashioned American democracy that he was happy to express his unease with Hunter Biden\u2019s business interests in Ukraine. Sadly for Trump, these good government types take a seriously dim view of a president corruptly using American military aid to manipulate American elections. The first day of the public impeachment hearings was not a fair fight. Against these diehard diplomats, the GOP relied on Jim Jordan, who just can\u2019t seem to shake off the stench of sex abuse at Ohio State University, where he used to coach wrestling. Then there was the flustered questioning from John Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican who was briefly Trump\u2019s nominee for director of national intelligence \u2013 until he was overwhelmed by his own problematic relationship with the truth on his personal r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cAre either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call?\u201d Ratcliffe barked at the two unimpeachable witnesses. \u201cShout it out \u2013 anyone?\u201d As Taylor tried to explain that it\u2019s for congressmen to answer, Ratcliffe withdrew his own question. \u201cThis is your job,\u201d said Taylor, speaking on behalf of us all. If only Republican members of Congress understood the strange foreign language these career diplomats speak. \u2022 Richard Wolffe is a Guardian US columnist",

Or so goes the story that has become the core of Narendra Modi\u2019s extraordinary appeal.</p>\n    <p>Modi was born in 1958 to a poor family in western India\u2019s Gujarat state, where he developed a strong dislike for the ruling Congress party as a result of hanging around a political office near his father\u2019s tea stall.</p>\n    <p>While still a child, he started attending daily meetings of the <a href=\"http://rss.org/\">Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh</a>, said to be the world\u2019s largest volunteer organisation, whose Hindu nationalist ideology envisions the country\u2019s diverse Hindu population as a single nation with a sacred culture that should be given primacy in India.</p>\n    <p>Hindu nationalists were sidelined by India\u2019s founding prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/may/01/greatspeeches\">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, whose vision of India was of a secular nation at ease with its bewildering plurality. Their parties, including Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), struggled to win more than 10% of the national vote for decades until the 1990s, when they started to expand on the back of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/28/ayodhya-mosque-india-guardian-report\">national campaign to demolish a 16th-century Mughal mosque</a> and replace it with a Hindu temple.</p>\n    <p>BJP\u2019s support was limited to wealthier Hindus in the country\u2019s north and west, with resistance to the party from poor, marginalised Hindus, Muslims and south Indians thought to be permanent hurdles to Hindu nationalist domination.</p>\n    <p>Modi\u2019s magnetism, especially his personal branding as a tea boy who climbed to the country\u2019s highest ranks, has changed those calculations, drawing vast support from the country\u2019s emerging middle and lower-middle classes. Young Indians had grown up being told their country was on the cusp of becoming a superpower. In Modi they had a leader who spoke as if it already was.</p>\n    <p>Alongside aspiration, the BJP promotes a vision of Hindu cultural supremacy that sidelines the country\u2019s 300m minority population. As chief minister of Gujarat state, Modi was a firebrand Hindutva campaigner. In 2002, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/14/new-india-gujarat-massacre\">anti-Muslim riots in his state killed at least 1,000 people</a>, resulting in the future prime minister becoming an international pariah who was banned from entering the US.</p>\n    <p>In response, Modi presented himself as an outsider being attacked by elites: a refrain that would become a central part of his political messaging, that he was constantly being targeted by the English-speaking media out of Delhi.</p>\n    <p>When popular disgust at corruption scandals plaguing the previous Congress government boiled over into street protests in 2011, it provided the rightwing populist leader a national springboard. His mastery of political theatre, and finger on the pulse of Indians, has now secured him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/india-election-results-narendra-modi-bjp-victory\">the strongest mandate of any leader in decades</a>.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\">Michael Safi</a></b>&nbsp;<i>in Delhi</i><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Rushdie, Pamuk and Atwood were joined by 260 other writers, journalists, artists, academics and activists, along with PEN America, English PEN, and PEN International, expressing their \u201cgrave concern\u201d <a href=\"https://pen.org/indian-government-review-taseer/\">in a letter to Modi about the move</a>.

Dems try to capture America\u2019s attention as hearings go public The Democrats see the impeachment process as their best chance to break through the partisan echo chambers and put the case against Donald Trump to the American public. And the first day of televised testimony certainly proved damning for the president, with the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, telling the House intelligence committee he understood Trump \u201ccared more\u201d about forcing a damaging, unfounded investigation of his political rival, Joe Biden, than about the future of Ukraine. Democrats handled the hearings like pros, writes Moira Donegan, as Republicans flailed in search of a convincing defence of the president. But while the Guardian\u2019s panel of experts believe Adam Schiff and co are building a compelling case, they are far less certain it will lead to Trump\u2019s ouster. At a bar in Kansas City, Chris McGreal found the public mood much the same. Fox News. The president\u2019s most fervent media defender covered the hearings with discrediting commentary and audience gaslighting in its efforts to exonerate the president, writes Adam Gabbatt. Drag Queen. Also covering the hearings: drag queen Pissi Myles, who turned heads by turning up on Capitol Hill in a scarlet dress and stilettos to report for Happs, a live news startup. Trump says troops in Syria \u2018only for the oil\u2019, contradicting aides The president insisted on Wednesday that the US military remains in Syria \u201conly for the oil\u201d, a direct contradiction of his own officials, who say US troops have stayed in the region to continue the fight against Isis. Trump made the remarks while sitting alongside the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who was visiting DC just over a month since Turkey launched its controversial offensive in northern Syria, to the dismay of US lawmakers and Trump\u2019s own state department. Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Trump proposed designating undocumented immigrants as \u201cenemy combatants\u201d and shipping them to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, according to a forthcoming book by an anonymous author purporting to be a \u201csenior official\u201d in the administration. Stephen Miller. Newly revealed emails between a Breitbart writer and the senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller show Miller promoted racist conspiracy theories and implied a bipartisan organisation backed by Mark Zuckerberg was promoting illegal voting. Majority of Facebook anti-vaxx ads funded by two groups A new study published by the journal Vaccine has found that more than half of the ads on Facebook spreading misinformation about vaccines are backed by just two groups. Between them, Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s World Mercury Project and Stop Mandatory Vaccinations, a project led by campaigner Larry Cook, bought 54% of the anti-vaxx ads shown on the social media platform during the period of the study.

Cheat sheet Aung San Suu Kyi, the Myanmar leader and Nobel Laureate, is for the first time facing legal action over the persecution of Rohingya Muslims, after she was named in a case filed in Argentina, accusing several top Myanmar officials of complicity in genocide. Israel and the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad have agreed to an Egyptian-mediated ceasefire in the Gaza Strip after 48 hours of fighting in which 34 Palestinians have been killed, the region\u2019s worst surge in violence for months. Dozens of foreign students have been urged to flee Hong Kong as violent clashes between pro-democracy protesters and police continue to worsen, with the island\u2019s university campuses becoming battlegrounds amid the rising unrest. French researchers believe that human hair may be to blame for urban pigeons\u2019 widespread toe loss, after a study found that pigeon toe mutilation \u201ctended to increase with the density of hairdressers\u201d.

But as Elle Hunt discovers, the motivations behind men and women\u2019s sexting habits may not be all that dissimilar. Opinion Under Evo Morales and his Movement for Socialism party, much of Bolivia\u2019s indigenous-majority population has lived above poverty for the first time ever, writes Nick Estes. Which means a coup against Evo is a coup against indigenous people. The indigenous-socialist project accomplished what neoliberalism has repeatedly failed to do: redistribute wealth to society\u2019s poorest sectors and uplift those most marginalized.

The case related to 2016 allegations of links to rebels in the Niger Delta, after which he was detained by Nigeria\u2019s intelligence agency for two years without trial. In the southern state of Cross River, Agba Jalingo, who publishes the Cross River Watch paper, was arrested in August, days after the publication of an article about alleged corruption. Jalingo has been charged with treason and a bail request has been declined. Human rights activists and civil society groups say that the muzzling of the press under Buhari has raised the spectre of a return to the dark days of military rule in Nigeria. Buhari, a former army general who has been president since 2015, was also Nigeria\u2019s head of state in the mid-1980s, when he took power in a military coup. At the time he introduced the draconian Public Officers (Protection Against False Accusation) law, better known as Decree 4. The law targeted the press, criminalising the publication of information deemed injurious to the junta. \u201cThese [recent] incidents suggest a disturbing trend towards repression of freedom of expression and create a climate of fear which may stifle the media,\u201d said Anietie Ewang, Nigeria researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThrowing reporters in jail for doing their job of informing the public sends a chilling message to journalists, activists and citizens.\u201d Soyombo said gagging the press was a misuse of power. \u201cIt is an irony that a president and state governors who ascended to power via the polls can suddenly not tolerate dissent,\u201d he said.",

The site operators can see all reviews; they do not seek to monitor posts, but operate a flagging system by which users can identify potentially inappropriate comments. CribAdvisor has been set up as a company, but its three founders have so far worked for no financial reward \u2013 students users and providers both register free of charge. While they hope to attract advertising in the future, Hopewell says that will not come from accommodation providers or others involved in the letting business. \u201cWorking for the past year alongside studying in my final year was stressful, but I knew it needed to be done and the sooner we got it out, the sooner we could help people,\u201d she says.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018For homos, heteros, lesbos and don\u2019t knows.\u201d Since 1997, these words have guided Manchester\u2019s Homoelectric. Started as a retort to the entrenched etiquette and increasingly tacky music of the bars clustered around Canal Street in the city\u2019s Gay Village, Homoelectric grew to become one of the UK\u2019s best-loved institutions. Prioritising a musical policy of house, techno, space disco, Italo, acid and outsider pop that was uncommonly eclectic for the time, it has survived waves of changes to Manchester\u2019s physical landscape, as well as shifts in the wider social ones. Upscaling an independent and nomadic gay night to a 10,000-capacity festival, though? A high-stakes manoeuvre.</p> <p>It had been in Homoelectric co-founder Luke Unabomber\u2019s mind for years, but repeated attempts to establish it as a summer knees-up on the outskirts of Manchester kept falling through. Suddenly, a dream spot was available. The cavernous space of The Depot, just a few hundred yards from Homoelectric\u2019s first venue, Follies, and within earshot of Piccadilly station, had broken free from red tape. In 2018, Warehouse Project, the big beast of Manchester clubbing, acquired the rights to host shows there. They were keen to assist in making Homobloc a reality, but aware enough to let it be established on Homoelectric\u2019s terms, so as best to encourage discerning Mancunian clubbers who prize independence and authenticity. From the announcement on 10 July, the hype was deafening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a52806b67e6fa682ceaf97335343a59ff173f742\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a52806b67e6fa682ceaf97335343a59ff173f742/0_0_2160_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luke Unabomber, centre, at Homobloc festival 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luke Unabomber, centre, at Homobloc festival 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jody Hartley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This intended gay utopia, Unabomber says, suddenly became a vision of hell. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve got the ultimate date, but you know you\u2019ve got to go out there and perform. And you think, \u2018What the fuck am I going to do? I might not even get it up! They\u2019re going to hate me.\u2019 It\u2019s not just a shag. You want to deliver for someone you really love.\u201d Unabomber, a larger-than-life gadabout who speaks in grandiloquent passages \u2013 \u201ca gobshite\u201d, in his own words \u2013 was racked with fear about blowing what people wanted to be a landmark event in Manchester\u2019s gay history. \u201cThe pressure has been insurmountable. I\u2019ve never been more anxious in my entire life.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of jangled nerves, Homobloc did deliver. Walking into Mayfield Depot was a beautiful scene, even with freezing rain lashing down outside. The crowd was a coalition of grizzled bears, feather-boa-adorned fortysomethings out for their big one of the year, and Gen Zs in Frank Ocean crop tops. They sported capes, chaps, taches, tassels, chiffon bodysuits with the genitals X\u2019d out, hats made out of cantaloupe\u2019d disco balls and every colour of hair dye imaginable, and danced hard from 2pm until 3am. \u201cAll shades of LGBT on the rainbow,\u201d Unabomber grins, \u201chave started partying together. There\u2019s no tribalism. I haven\u2019t seen the mood this good since the days of acid house.\u201d</p> <p>As much as the focus on intergenerational community spirit, what helped Homobloc to sell out was that the lineup was as strong as conceivable for any festival\u2019s first year. Performers ranged from longstanding, high-profile friends of Homoelectric \u2013 Robyn, Erol Alkan, Midland, Prosumer \u2013 to contemporary queer icons such as the Black Madonna and the xx frontwoman Romy, who have taken danceable messages of self-belief and positivity, and projected them to arenas. Unabomber personally got on the phone whenever the booking process got sticky, vouching that Homobloc was going to be \u201cthe one\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79112ebfee7c5599931684b5a2a4e047922a5280\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79112ebfee7c5599931684b5a2a4e047922a5280/0_0_2160_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the crowd at Homobloc festival 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the crowd at Homobloc festival 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jody Hartley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To get people down early, contemporary limelights such as Gide\u00f6n, Jaye Ward, Honey Soundsystem, Hifi Sean and Dan Beaumont were all billed before teatime, as well as representatives from Kiss Me Again and High Hoops. These are two local parties that, alongside techno-focused Meat Free, Unabomber cites as keeping Homoelectric\u2019s mix of adventurous musical and dancefloor warmth burning for a younger generation. It was paramount to Unabomber and co that the festival really did function as \u201ca queer block party for all\u201d.</p> <p>More than 200 dancers and alternative performers from Manchester and beyond were brought in to roam across four areas within Mayfield Depot, some imported from collectives Night Bus and Little Gay Brother, others choreographed by Sophie B. Bollox and Body Horror, two of the city\u2019s more outre parties, added a particularly northern tongue-in-cheek flavour: all shapes and sizes squeezed into latex outfits and carried placards that mimicked the distinctive signs of the heinously homophobic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/14/louis-theroux-surviving-americas-most-hated-family-review-a-deeply-uncomfortable-watch\">Westboro Baptist church</a>, then inverted them.

So, yes, we are inclusive \u2013 but, no, we don\u2019t want wankers in.\u201d Hammering home the message in a promotional video narrated by drag star Cheddar Gorgeous dressed as a fabulous unicorn seemed to have worked.

When Homoelectric began, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/27/section-28-protesters-30-years-on-we-were-arrested-and-put-in-a-cell-up-by-big-ben\">Section 28</a>, a draconian law that banned overt promotion of homosexuality in the public domain, was still active. Manchester police, led in the 80s by a chief constable who denounced gays as being \u201cin a cesspit of their own making through HIV\u201d, donated a riot shield for the dancers to adorn. A sizzle reel of visuals backed DJs and dancers on the main stage. Shots of foundational figures Larry Levan and Frankie Knuckles, images of Stonewall and the first gay couples to adopt, local haunts The Glory Hole and The Mancunian Gay, art from Cindy Sherman, and sordid snaps from parties past all whizzed by.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cb1b5a19daad67cfa0f06a0374a9898a8501833\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cb1b5a19daad67cfa0f06a0374a9898a8501833/0_0_2160_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Team Homobloc at the bitter end, with the Black Madonna, centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Team Homobloc at the bitter end, with the Black Madonna, centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jody Hartley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most striking of all were images of present-day repression in Poland and Chechnya. In the weeks leading up to Homobloc, a partnership with LGBT+ charity <a href=\"https://allout.org/en\">All Out</a> <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/44707\">was announced</a> to help \u201cstand with our persecuted siblings around the world\u201d, as DJ and activist Midland said. Fundraisers made sure that the history displayed across the event functioned as a call to action \u2013 \u00a311,648 was made in all. \u201cIt was the biggest possible mosaic of stuff that we could put out there,\u201d Unabomber says. \u201cWe felt that it was a beautiful story. And we didn\u2019t want to go into overkill, because we were there to lift up spirits, but we sought a balance to something that was celebratory.\u201d</p> <p>This hammered home the journey the city\u2019s gay community has taken to arrive at a point where Homobloc is not just permissable, but a wild success. The anything-goes musical and sexual policy of Homoelectric proved scalable after all. It made the festival feel historical, but not traditional. Even moments to revel in the commercial disco nostalgia that Homoelectric first pushed back on were relished: when Honey Dijon wrapped up her set with Sylvester\u2019s anthemic You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real), it\u2019s hard to imagine any event of Homobloc\u2019s size in louder, prouder voice.</p> <h2>Five key Homoelectric tracks, by residents Will Tramp, Gina Breeze and Jamie Bull</h2> <p><strong>Prince \u2013 Sticky Like Glue (JC Extended mix)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C10KIeb0SJA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C10KIeb0SJA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Hard to find, unofficial remix of Prince by Joe Clausell of Body &amp; Soul fame, this is 15 minutes of organs, trademark sleazy Prince vocals and lots of percussion.

When Homoelectric began, Section 28, a draconian law that banned overt promotion of homosexuality in the public domain, was still active. Manchester police, led in the 80s by a chief constable who denounced gays as being \u201cin a cesspit of their own making through HIV\u201d, donated a riot shield for the dancers to adorn. A sizzle reel of visuals backed DJs and dancers on the main stage. Shots of foundational figures Larry Levan and Frankie Knuckles, images of Stonewall and the first gay couples to adopt, local haunts The Glory Hole and The Mancunian Gay, art from Cindy Sherman, and sordid snaps from parties past all whizzed by. Most striking of all were images of present-day repression in Poland and Chechnya. In the weeks leading up to Homobloc, a partnership with LGBT+ charity All Out was announced to help \u201cstand with our persecuted siblings around the world\u201d, as DJ and activist Midland said. Fundraisers made sure that the history displayed across the event functioned as a call to action \u2013 \u00a311,648 was made in all. \u201cIt was the biggest possible mosaic of stuff that we could put out there,\u201d Unabomber says. \u201cWe felt that it was a beautiful story. And we didn\u2019t want to go into overkill, because we were there to lift up spirits, but we sought a balance to something that was celebratory.\u201d This hammered home the journey the city\u2019s gay community has taken to arrive at a point where Homobloc is not just permissable, but a wild success. The anything-goes musical and sexual policy of Homoelectric proved scalable after all. It made the festival feel historical, but not traditional. Even moments to revel in the commercial disco nostalgia that Homoelectric first pushed back on were relished: when Honey Dijon wrapped up her set with Sylvester\u2019s anthemic You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real), it\u2019s hard to imagine any event of Homobloc\u2019s size in louder, prouder voice. Five key Homoelectric tracks, by residents Will Tramp, Gina Breeze and Jamie Bull Prince \u2013 Sticky Like Glue (JC Extended mix) Hard to find, unofficial remix of Prince by Joe Clausell of Body &amp; Soul fame, this is 15 minutes of organs, trademark sleazy Prince vocals and lots of percussion. The joy of repetition personified. Peggi Blu \u2013 I Want It All Now (Justin Van Der Volgen Edit) Hard-to-find disco edit from Justin Van Der Volgen of Out Hud and !!! fame. Huge, hands-in-the-air Homoelectric anthem that has been a staple in our sets for years, and it\u2019s Shazam-proof. Front Page \u2013 You Got Love Song (C.O.M.B.i. Edit) Arpeggiated chugger with a more-than-dramatic string section. Just when you think it can\u2019t tug at the heartstrings any more, a killer, sultry female vocal comes in halfway through. Disco perfection. Gina Breeze \u2013 Reckless From one of our own residents, this sultry, acid-tinged slammer has become a Homoelectric classic. Miss Kittin \u2013 Girlz A favourite that can expect to be heard in the basement at Hidden. Killer vocal and all around ace-ness from Miss Kittin.",

East Gloucestershire, parts of Wiltshire and south Wales were blanketed in snow on Thursday morning, while snow continued to fall in Bath as of 7am.

On Wednesday, Boris Johnson was confronted by furious residents of Fishlake, who pleaded for help and accused the prime minister of not providing enough support when he visited the village near Doncaster. Forty flood warnings remain in effect across the country, along with 75 flood alerts, which mean flooding is possible.

      "bodyText": "Mexico\u2019s new human rights commissioner has questioned if journalists are actually killed in the country, which has become a cemetery for reporters over the past two decades \u2013 and has not become any safer since the arrival of a leftwing government late last year. After being elected commissioner on Tuesday night, Rosario Piedra Ibarra blithely responded to reporters\u2019 questions on the murder of reporters in the country by asking, \u201cThey\u2019ve killed journalists?\u201d She then insisted attacks on media members \u201chappened in past administrations and it\u2019s something terrible\u201d \u2013 even though at least 11 journalists have been murdered in Mexico since President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took office almost a year ago. Mexican journalists responded with outrage to Piedra\u2019s suggestion that attacks on the media had vanished with L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s arrival. A collective of journalists forced to flee their homes after attacks or threats filed a complaint against Piedra with the National Human Rights Commission \u2013 one of the first received by the body since she became its commissioner. \u201cThe simple ignorance of 131 journalists killed in Mexico, coming from the \u2018ombudsman\u2019, is, in itself, a violation of the human rights of those of us who have suffered violence for practicing journalism,\u201d tweeted Victims of Forced Internal Displacement in Mexico, which filed the complaint. \u201cMexico is the most dangerous country in the world to practise journalism,\u201d said the press freedom organisation Article 19. Mexico has a special prosecutor for pursuing crimes committed against the press but nearly all of the 544 attacks against journalists in 2018, it added, remain unsolved. Media workers have come under attack from organised crime as well as corrupt public officials including police officers and members of local governments. Three journalists were killed over just four days in August, including Jorge Ruiz V\u00e1zquez, who was killed in the eastern state of Veracruz after receiving multiple death threats and despite being in a government protection program. A newspaper in Chihuahua, El Monitor de Parral, ceased publishing its print edition after being firebombed the same month. Assailants also ransacked the home of investigative reporter Lydia Cacho, stealing documents and killing her two dogs. The comments from the new commissioner come amid a worsening relationship between L\u00f3pez Obrador and the press corps, who often come under intense criticism by the president\u2019s most ardent supporters for asking uncomfortable questions during his daily press conference. Last month, L\u00f3pez Obrador, commonly called \u201cAmlo\u201d, accused the press of ingratitude and chided them for \u201cbiting the hand of the person who removed its muzzle\u201d.

Police have been under increased pressure to sack Neil Punchard since the officer pleaded guilty to nine counts of computer hacking last month. Guardian Australia revealed this week Punchard was appealing the severity of his suspended prison sentence \u2013 a process that could ultimately influence whether he is reinstated or sacked. On Thursday, police released a statement that Punchard, who had been stood down from operational duty while facing charges but remained employed and paid by the service, had been suspended. \u201cA 52-year-old male senior constable from the road policing command has been suspended from the Queensland Police Service after being convicted and sentenced to two months\u2019 imprisonment suspended for 18 months for misusing a restricted computer,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe officer has appealed the court-imposed sentence. \u201cThe officer had been previously stood down when he was charged with the offences. \u201cFurther assessment of the officer\u2019s suitability to remain as a police officer will be determined following the outcome of the appeal.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Police disciplined Punchard in 2016 after he admitted during an internal interview to improperly accessing the police Qprime database \u2013 though he was not stood down, suspended or charged until late 2018, after years of public pressure and a campaign by the victim that has brought into focus more systemic issues. The decision to act more decisively on the state\u2019s most shocking computer hacking case comes amid a Crime and Corruption Commission public inquiry into public sector data misuse. The state\u2019s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, will give evidence on Monday. It is understood the outcome of the appeal will ultimately dictate whether Punchard can be sacked or further sanctioned.

He is their new overlord now. If they don\u2019t give him what he wants, he\u2019ll murder them and everyone they love in an orgy of unstoppable violence. The dance of freedom. The death bells. The rising of the Edgar. So that\u2019s the message John Lewis wants to push this year. You will never change your broken personality, so the best you can do is to weaponise it. Turn it into your greatest asset, regardless of the damage it causes society. Keep buying single use plastic. Keep taking unnecessary flights. It doesn\u2019t matter. Nothing does. The world is a speck of mud floating in a void of uncaring nothingness. A century from now, nobody will remember you even existed. Merry Christmas.",

      "body": "<p>The jacket for Cixin Liu\u2019s new novel carries a blurb from none other than Barack Obama: \u201cWildly imaginative, really interesting \u2026 The scope of it was immense.\u201d What the publishers rather disingenuously neglect to specify is that this and the other glowing review snippets are not for the present book at all, but for the multi-award-winning, global phenomenon that was his Remembrance of Earth\u2019s Past trilogy, beginning with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/14/liu-cixin-chinese-sci-fi-universal-the-three-body-problem\" title=\"\"><em>The Three-Body Problem</em> </a>(first published in English in 2014). Those novels are indeed a monumental and wondrous achievement: a mind-bending hard-sci fi epic peopled by vivid and lovable characters, in which the story just happens to explain why we have the laws of physics we observe.</p> <p>Admirers of that sensational triptych will find something rather different in <em>The Supernova Era</em>, which Liu actually wrote in 2003, before the first Chinese edition of <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> in 2007. Though it is adorned with the colourful nebulae of space-opera art, it is primarily a work of speculative sociology.</p> <p>That only becomes clear, though, after a masterful opening sequence detailing the death of a star. Liu is superb at creating drama from technical description (before becoming a writer, he worked as an engineer at a power plant), and he ramps up slowly to the moment of a supernova with exquisite tension. Why should we care about another supernova? Because this one is happening all too close to us: a mere eight light years away, a star that had been hidden from human eyes behind a dust cloud is now exploding.</p> <p>Eight years later, the radiation arrives at Earth, lighting up the atmosphere and wrecking DNA in all the life forms on the planet.

      "bodyText": "The jacket for Cixin Liu\u2019s new novel carries a blurb from none other than Barack Obama: \u201cWildly imaginative, really interesting \u2026 The scope of it was immense.\u201d What the publishers rather disingenuously neglect to specify is that this and the other glowing review snippets are not for the present book at all, but for the multi-award-winning, global phenomenon that was his Remembrance of Earth\u2019s Past trilogy, beginning with The Three-Body Problem (first published in English in 2014). Those novels are indeed a monumental and wondrous achievement: a mind-bending hard-sci fi epic peopled by vivid and lovable characters, in which the story just happens to explain why we have the laws of physics we observe. Admirers of that sensational triptych will find something rather different in The Supernova Era, which Liu actually wrote in 2003, before the first Chinese edition of The Three-Body Problem in 2007. Though it is adorned with the colourful nebulae of space-opera art, it is primarily a work of speculative sociology. That only becomes clear, though, after a masterful opening sequence detailing the death of a star. Liu is superb at creating drama from technical description (before becoming a writer, he worked as an engineer at a power plant), and he ramps up slowly to the moment of a supernova with exquisite tension. Why should we care about another supernova? Because this one is happening all too close to us: a mere eight light years away, a star that had been hidden from human eyes behind a dust cloud is now exploding. Eight years later, the radiation arrives at Earth, lighting up the atmosphere and wrecking DNA in all the life forms on the planet. The authorities soon realise that everyone will die in a matter of months, except for children aged 13 and under: they are young enough, it is discovered, that their bodies can repair the DNA damage. In the time remaining, the adults have somehow to train the children in the disciplines required to keep agriculture and technological civilisation going, and select national leaders to take over when they die. The novel focuses on the three 13-year-old Chinese children who are to rule the country, and later on their American counterparts. What happens when children are left to run the world on their own?

Sometimes that\u2019s a shorthand for the closest thing they\u2019ve come to \u201cglory years\u201d, when they spent much of the \u201890s under Michael Jordan\u2019s shoe and wasted the one year he traded in his sneakers for cleats thanks to one guard\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn3vwyY_uO4\">tragic Game 7 shooting performance</a> in the NBA finals. The physicality that went into every Knicks field goal and their underdog personas also endeared them to the working-class fans. And in Jamaican-American Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing, Flatbush\u2019s strong Caribbean contingent had their pride.</p> <p>Generation Y isn\u2019t far enough removed from those years to not have memories of watching them unfold with their parents. They did come of age in the century where the Knicks have the worst winning percentage in the NBA and \u2013 even more unforgivably \u2013 saw them waste Carmelo Anthony\u2019s prime years by making him watch the playoffs from the couch with us. Some stick by because the spectacular mediocrity is a way of life at this point. I\u2019m not part of that some: You\u2019re birthed into a set of struggles when you grow up in a Caribbean working class home in Brooklyn; if there\u2019s a voluntary hardship, I\u2019ll opt-out.</p> <p>But just latching on to the competent franchise isn\u2019t so simple. Anyone who\u2019s lived near Flatbush for over 15 years has had conversations attempting to take stock at just how much has changed within its radius. These talks often, at best, carry a bitter awe: The coffee shop jokes are a clich\u00e9, but they\u2019re street level stand-ins for the tight-knit communities priced out and displaced, leaving those left behind to grouse about a way of life they can barely afford. The neat story of Brooklyn is of a borough that\u2019s survived the debasement of the crack era and soaring murder rates. But that narrative is about change of one thing. New Brooklyn and Old Brooklyn aren\u2019t quite the same; the former is a capitalist force that\u2019s imposed on the latter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ae12f3d6815d88c065825678c94bdd01d37216e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae12f3d6815d88c065825678c94bdd01d37216e3/0_0_3000_2058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barclays Center\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The intersection of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues in Brooklyn, currently the main entrance of the $1bn Barclays Center, as seen in January 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barclays Center and the Nets didn\u2019t solely cause the renewal, but they\u2019re the most visible symbols of that dissonance. \u201cGentrification\u201d peaked as a buzzword during the Nets\u2019 first two seasons in Brooklyn, but the arena\u2019s inherent odiousness was there a decade prior. Barclays is part of the Atlantic Yards project, real estate mogul Bruce Ratner\u2019s $4.9bn plan to transform 22 acres in downtown Brooklyn for residential and commercial purposes.</p> <p>Architect Frank Gehry eagerly hinted at the 2003 press conference announcing the plan that the community wasn\u2019t a priority, saying he was ready \u201cto build a whole neighborhood practically from scratch\u201d. He\u2019d be fired from the project in 2009 as a cost-cutting measure, but his foreshadowing came to fruition. Independent businesses and families were forced out by increased rent. Pacific Park/Atlantic Yards developers, Forest City Ratner, and any current or future developers are required to build 2,250 affordable housing units by 2025; they\u2019re behind schedule and the units they did build are mainly affordable to moderate and middle-income families, according to Michelle de la Uz, executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee and a member of BrooklynSpeaks. Another insult was how financial interests could prostrate state and city-funded land to Chinese real estate developers and a Russian oligarch for investments; the working class and other non-members of the 1% didn\u2019t get that sort of affection.</p> <p>The Warriors are analogous to Brooklyn in some ways. Golden State\u2019s reign as the decade\u2019s most dominant dynasty went along with San Francisco\u2019s rent rising to an average of $3,550 for a one-bedroom apartment as the Bay Area reconfigured itself around the tech boom. Still, the team logo illustrates the Golden Gate Bridge, which is just as much of a wholesome San Francisco signature as it was when Full House was on and the Warriors\u2019 seasons ended in April. Barclays Center Nets games comes replete with did-you-know-that-we-are-in-Brooklyn accoutrements \u2013 has there been a home game where there isn\u2019t one Jay-Z reference played through the speakers?</p> <p>But taking on hip-hop aesthetics seem at odds with city policy\u2019s historic impetuousness against the black working class from which the culture originates. The stadium opened under the mayorship of Michael Bloomberg, who was openly support of the violative stop-and-frisk police tactics that disproportionately affected young black men. Even seven years later, the police\u2019s new emphasis on cracking down on the violent crime of fare evasion has been criticized as another example of the MTA\u2019s bias against the vulnerable poor. It\u2019s hard to think of a sports franchise this eager to wear the culture of those its city insists on purging.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f297b81ef40410e0029d8d5e4700a3e3d1e3655\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f297b81ef40410e0029d8d5e4700a3e3d1e3655/0_0_2441_1614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brooklyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign in the window of 363 Pacific Street in 2004, a building that was demolished to make way for the Barclays Center.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For many, the Nets have come to represent an act of capitalist imposition instead of something that blustery former Brooklyn president Marty Markowitz claimed the borough would be \u201c1000%\u201d behind. But Barclays Center\u2019s life as a corporate barnacle isn\u2019t without precedent. A few blocks closer to the bridge lies the MetroTech Center, another Ratner project that bounced hundreds of people from their homes and razed businesses in the name of commerce. I remember feeling an out-of-placeness every time I walked past the complex to and from high school, where our heirloom was bucketball, a game in which a bucket sat atop a stack of mats as a makeshift basket because the school was too run down for a gym. This downtown Brooklyn was never really ours, but we\u2019d made memories around its auspices nonetheless.</p> <p>I ended up embracing the Nets fairly quickly, though. It had very little to do with them being the borough\u2019s first team since the Dodgers left in 1957 \u2013 Brooklyn has endured worse traumas than a baseball team leaving. Having a hometown team you could talk about for long periods without a forlorn sigh helped, too: The Nets are already on pace to have more playoff berths this century than the Knicks since their move.</p> <p>A lot of working-class Brooklyn\u2019s fate has been decided by various systemic cruelties, policies and capitalist ambition, long before \u201cgentrification\u201d became common lingo, during every one of the Knicks\u2019 losing spells. Those ailments all follow Barclays, but it\u2019s myopic to pin them solely on the arena. What\u2019s a more specific experience to the Nets is how it grew from having a washed-up Joe Johnson to having Kyrie Irving getting buckets across the street from the decades-old PC Richard &amp; Son. To love a sports team is an inherently vicarious endeavor; Jackson and I took pride in how our relationship with the Nets is a bit more intimate.</p> <p>\u201cThe rest of my family, they root for the Nets but they\u2019re still Knicks fans. They\u2019re like, \u2018Nah I can\u2019t just go against the Knicks like that.\u201d Jackson said as he drove away from Barclays. \u201cBut for me, nah. That shirt say Brooklyn. That birth certificate say Brooklyn. I\u2019m going for Brooklyn.\u201d</p>",

My longtime friend Elijah said that \u201cbeing a Knicks fan is like being a fan of old New York\u201d. Sometimes that\u2019s a shorthand for the closest thing they\u2019ve come to \u201cglory years\u201d, when they spent much of the \u201890s under Michael Jordan\u2019s shoe and wasted the one year he traded in his sneakers for cleats thanks to one guard\u2019s tragic Game 7 shooting performance in the NBA finals. The physicality that went into every Knicks field goal and their underdog personas also endeared them to the working-class fans. And in Jamaican-American Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing, Flatbush\u2019s strong Caribbean contingent had their pride. Generation Y isn\u2019t far enough removed from those years to not have memories of watching them unfold with their parents. They did come of age in the century where the Knicks have the worst winning percentage in the NBA and \u2013 even more unforgivably \u2013 saw them waste Carmelo Anthony\u2019s prime years by making him watch the playoffs from the couch with us. Some stick by because the spectacular mediocrity is a way of life at this point. I\u2019m not part of that some: You\u2019re birthed into a set of struggles when you grow up in a Caribbean working class home in Brooklyn; if there\u2019s a voluntary hardship, I\u2019ll opt-out. But just latching on to the competent franchise isn\u2019t so simple. Anyone who\u2019s lived near Flatbush for over 15 years has had conversations attempting to take stock at just how much has changed within its radius. These talks often, at best, carry a bitter awe: The coffee shop jokes are a clich\u00e9, but they\u2019re street level stand-ins for the tight-knit communities priced out and displaced, leaving those left behind to grouse about a way of life they can barely afford. The neat story of Brooklyn is of a borough that\u2019s survived the debasement of the crack era and soaring murder rates. But that narrative is about change of one thing. New Brooklyn and Old Brooklyn aren\u2019t quite the same; the former is a capitalist force that\u2019s imposed on the latter. Barclays Center and the Nets didn\u2019t solely cause the renewal, but they\u2019re the most visible symbols of that dissonance. \u201cGentrification\u201d peaked as a buzzword during the Nets\u2019 first two seasons in Brooklyn, but the arena\u2019s inherent odiousness was there a decade prior. Barclays is part of the Atlantic Yards project, real estate mogul Bruce Ratner\u2019s $4.9bn plan to transform 22 acres in downtown Brooklyn for residential and commercial purposes. Architect Frank Gehry eagerly hinted at the 2003 press conference announcing the plan that the community wasn\u2019t a priority, saying he was ready \u201cto build a whole neighborhood practically from scratch\u201d. He\u2019d be fired from the project in 2009 as a cost-cutting measure, but his foreshadowing came to fruition. Independent businesses and families were forced out by increased rent. Pacific Park/Atlantic Yards developers, Forest City Ratner, and any current or future developers are required to build 2,250 affordable housing units by 2025; they\u2019re behind schedule and the units they did build are mainly affordable to moderate and middle-income families, according to Michelle de la Uz, executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee and a member of BrooklynSpeaks. Another insult was how financial interests could prostrate state and city-funded land to Chinese real estate developers and a Russian oligarch for investments; the working class and other non-members of the 1% didn\u2019t get that sort of affection. The Warriors are analogous to Brooklyn in some ways. Golden State\u2019s reign as the decade\u2019s most dominant dynasty went along with San Francisco\u2019s rent rising to an average of $3,550 for a one-bedroom apartment as the Bay Area reconfigured itself around the tech boom. Still, the team logo illustrates the Golden Gate Bridge, which is just as much of a wholesome San Francisco signature as it was when Full House was on and the Warriors\u2019 seasons ended in April. Barclays Center Nets games comes replete with did-you-know-that-we-are-in-Brooklyn accoutrements \u2013 has there been a home game where there isn\u2019t one Jay-Z reference played through the speakers? But taking on hip-hop aesthetics seem at odds with city policy\u2019s historic impetuousness against the black working class from which the culture originates. The stadium opened under the mayorship of Michael Bloomberg, who was openly support of the violative stop-and-frisk police tactics that disproportionately affected young black men. Even seven years later, the police\u2019s new emphasis on cracking down on the violent crime of fare evasion has been criticized as another example of the MTA\u2019s bias against the vulnerable poor. It\u2019s hard to think of a sports franchise this eager to wear the culture of those its city insists on purging. For many, the Nets have come to represent an act of capitalist imposition instead of something that blustery former Brooklyn president Marty Markowitz claimed the borough would be \u201c1000%\u201d behind. But Barclays Center\u2019s life as a corporate barnacle isn\u2019t without precedent. A few blocks closer to the bridge lies the MetroTech Center, another Ratner project that bounced hundreds of people from their homes and razed businesses in the name of commerce. I remember feeling an out-of-placeness every time I walked past the complex to and from high school, where our heirloom was bucketball, a game in which a bucket sat atop a stack of mats as a makeshift basket because the school was too run down for a gym. This downtown Brooklyn was never really ours, but we\u2019d made memories around its auspices nonetheless. I ended up embracing the Nets fairly quickly, though. It had very little to do with them being the borough\u2019s first team since the Dodgers left in 1957 \u2013 Brooklyn has endured worse traumas than a baseball team leaving. Having a hometown team you could talk about for long periods without a forlorn sigh helped, too: The Nets are already on pace to have more playoff berths this century than the Knicks since their move. A lot of working-class Brooklyn\u2019s fate has been decided by various systemic cruelties, policies and capitalist ambition, long before \u201cgentrification\u201d became common lingo, during every one of the Knicks\u2019 losing spells. Those ailments all follow Barclays, but it\u2019s myopic to pin them solely on the arena. What\u2019s a more specific experience to the Nets is how it grew from having a washed-up Joe Johnson to having Kyrie Irving getting buckets across the street from the decades-old PC Richard &amp; Son. To love a sports team is an inherently vicarious endeavor; Jackson and I took pride in how our relationship with the Nets is a bit more intimate. \u201cThe rest of my family, they root for the Nets but they\u2019re still Knicks fans. They\u2019re like, \u2018Nah I can\u2019t just go against the Knicks like that.\u201d Jackson said as he drove away from Barclays. \u201cBut for me, nah. That shirt say Brooklyn. That birth certificate say Brooklyn. I\u2019m going for Brooklyn.\u201d",

Perhaps he\u2019s a fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/26/marie-kondo-declutter-mind-time-psychology\">Marie Kondo</a> and understands that a tidy workplace leads to a tidy mind. Well, that\u2019s one theory The Mill has as to why he has despatched Juventus\u2019s director of football to England to encourage <strong>Manchester United</strong> suits to take <strong>Mario Mandzukic </strong>off his hands. The 33-year-old has not played a minute for the Italian champions under Sarri and is blocking corridors and creating bad feng shui around the place. Some reports suggest he has already \u201cpacked his bags\u201d in anticipation of a move to Alderley Edge.</p> <p>Italian tabloids believe that Fabio Paratici may also have clear instructions to move conversation swiftly on to <strong>Paul Pogba</strong> once a cut-price deal for the brawny Croat has been agreed to lift the mood of United negotiators. The French midfielder\u2019s contract expires in a little over 18 months and with no immediate sign that he\u2019s about to ink a new deal, it could be time to ask <strong>Juventus</strong> how much cash they have.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/13/danny-rose-tottenham-not-going-anywhere-contract\">\u2018I\u2019m not going anywhere\u2019: Danny Rose resolves to see out Tottenham contract</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Paratici might want to call in at the Emirates Stadium while he is in England. The word is that <strong>Arsenal </strong>are keen on helping Sarri with his de-cluttering exercise and are prepared to splash \u00a334m on central defender <strong>Merih Demiral</strong>, who has played just once for Juve this season. The Gunners have sent scouts to Istanbul to watch the 21-year-old in action for Turkey against Iceland on Thursday, perhaps just to make sure he\u2019s not another Shkodran Mustafi.</p> <p><strong>Liverpool</strong> have slipped on their running shoes and joined <strong>Manchester United, Barcelona, PSG</strong> and<strong> Real Madrid</strong> in the race to sign <strong>Jadon Sancho.</strong> The young English forward has had enough of being told to sit on the naughty step at Borussia Dortmund, where he was recently fined \u00a386,000 and left out of a matchday squad after returning late from international duty.</p> <p><strong>Watford</strong> are in the hunt for a centre-back too, and the \u201cKorean Van Dijk\u201d has caught the eye of their scouts. <strong>Kim Min</strong><strong>-jae</strong>, who plays for Beijing Guoan, has been described as a \u201cmonster\u201d by some observers, which is a bit harsh because he has a kindly face atop his strapping 6ft 3in frame. It says here that Asian Champions League rules may scupper the Hornets\u2019 chances, though.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/06/antonio-conte-lambasts-inter-hierarchy-for-poor-planning-after-loss-at-dortmund\">Having given his </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/06/antonio-conte-lambasts-inter-hierarchy-for-poor-planning-after-loss-at-dortmund\">Inter </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/06/antonio-conte-lambasts-inter-hierarchy-for-poor-planning-after-loss-at-dortmund\">overlords verbal pelters</a> for leaving him short of options, Antonio Conte\u2019s tantrum looks set to be rewarded in January.

Parma\u2019s <strong>Dejan Kulusevski </strong>is getting Conte hot and bothered too.

In a tale that sounds like it could have been plucked from the pages of Roy of the Rovers, the teenager has been ripping it up for Edinburgh amateur side Hutchison Vale, and has been so impressive that scouts from some of the best sides in Europe have been down to Saughton Enclosure to watch him dazzle locals with his tricks and flicks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Maurizio Sarri would like to do some de-cluttering at Juventus this January. Perhaps he\u2019s a fan of Marie Kondo and understands that a tidy workplace leads to a tidy mind. Well, that\u2019s one theory The Mill has as to why he has despatched Juventus\u2019s director of football to England to encourage Manchester United suits to take Mario Mandzukic off his hands. The 33-year-old has not played a minute for the Italian champions under Sarri and is blocking corridors and creating bad feng shui around the place. Some reports suggest he has already \u201cpacked his bags\u201d in anticipation of a move to Alderley Edge. Italian tabloids believe that Fabio Paratici may also have clear instructions to move conversation swiftly on to Paul Pogba once a cut-price deal for the brawny Croat has been agreed to lift the mood of United negotiators. The French midfielder\u2019s contract expires in a little over 18 months and with no immediate sign that he\u2019s about to ink a new deal, it could be time to ask Juventus how much cash they have. Paratici might want to call in at the Emirates Stadium while he is in England. The word is that Arsenal are keen on helping Sarri with his de-cluttering exercise and are prepared to splash \u00a334m on central defender Merih Demiral, who has played just once for Juve this season. The Gunners have sent scouts to Istanbul to watch the 21-year-old in action for Turkey against Iceland on Thursday, perhaps just to make sure he\u2019s not another Shkodran Mustafi. Liverpool have slipped on their running shoes and joined Manchester United, Barcelona, PSG and Real Madrid in the race to sign Jadon Sancho. The young English forward has had enough of being told to sit on the naughty step at Borussia Dortmund, where he was recently fined \u00a386,000 and left out of a matchday squad after returning late from international duty. Watford are in the hunt for a centre-back too, and the \u201cKorean Van Dijk\u201d has caught the eye of their scouts. Kim Min-jae, who plays for Beijing Guoan, has been described as a \u201cmonster\u201d by some observers, which is a bit harsh because he has a kindly face atop his strapping 6ft 3in frame. It says here that Asian Champions League rules may scupper the Hornets\u2019 chances, though. Having given his Inter overlords verbal pelters for leaving him short of options, Antonio Conte\u2019s tantrum looks set to be rewarded in January. Chelsea\u2019s Olivier Giroud is likely to be the first in the door at San Siro for just \u00a36m, while Christian Eriksen may follow him from London next summer when his Tottenham contract expires. Parma\u2019s Dejan Kulusevski is getting Conte hot and bothered too. The 19-year-old midfielder, on loan from Atalanta, has five assists and two goals to his name from just 12 appearances. Perhaps because he enjoys annoying Rangers fans, Brendan Rodgers has told Leicester scouts to keep a keen eye on Alfredo Morelos in anticipation of a January bid. The Colombian striker has already scored a staggering 22 goals this season. For what it is worth, Rangers say he is going nowhere, mind. The Foxes are also among a host of clubs, including Celtic, Wolves and Liverpool, who are keeping tabs on 15-year-old \u201cScottish wonderkid\u201d Bruno Davidson. In a tale that sounds like it could have been plucked from the pages of Roy of the Rovers, the teenager has been ripping it up for Edinburgh amateur side Hutchison Vale, and has been so impressive that scouts from some of the best sides in Europe have been down to Saughton Enclosure to watch him dazzle locals with his tricks and flicks.",

Growing the game is vital as is their image and incomes, so commercial opportunities must be balanced alongside rest and health, with little guidance on how one aspect will affect the other. Critically, there is time for Neville \u2013if he is backed by the FA \u2013 to tackle the problems holding back a team with enormous potential.",

It\u2019s a small, inoffensive-looking black box that will happily sit alongside any other under your TV, and adopts Virgin\u2019s red-on-black theme for lights and highlights. It supports 4K, HDR and can record six shows while you watch a seventh, with 1TB of space for all your recordings \u2013 which is plenty given on-demand content is streamed not downloaded.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/07/sky-q-2019-review-price\">Sky Q 2019 review: premium TV at a premium price</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fire up the V6 on your TV and you\u2019ll immediately be struck by how old-fashioned the interface looks. The box is fast, meaning flicking between menu options, channels, scrolling through guides and other actions are quick. There\u2019s even a previous channel button to immediately flick between two channels. I would absolutely take speed over a pretty interface any day.</p> <p>But many actions are buried deep in menus. The TV guide looks particularly dated, and while you can create a favourites list you cannot reorder them. So you\u2019re stuck with a lot of scrolling to do if you want to see all your usual suspects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62925bcd6be6de87ff6940be13ef7783f1e00314\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62925bcd6be6de87ff6940be13ef7783f1e00314/229_457_3961_2377/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Virgin V6 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The V6 box is at its most powerful when configuring recordings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s also fairly complicated to navigate, but once you dig a little deeper you discover that Virgin\u2019s recording and content handling is really powerful. Beyond simply setting a full season to record you can specify the quality, the channel, how many episodes to keep, whether it\u2019s new episodes only or all of them and add a little time buffer before and after the recording.

      "bodyText": "Virgin Media is Sky\u2019s long-time rival in the pay-TV space, delivering TV coverage through its own cable network to its latest V6 box. Positioned as the king of the aggregators where you can get everyone\u2019s channels for cheaper, does Virgin deliver? First things first, Virgin TV only works if you happen to live in a cable area, which immediately makes its availability smaller than Sky, BT or the others. Virgin currently covers over 50% of UK households with a target to reach 53% by the end of 2020. Virgin\u2019s TV services are handled by its latest generation Tivo, simply called the V6. It\u2019s a small, inoffensive-looking black box that will happily sit alongside any other under your TV, and adopts Virgin\u2019s red-on-black theme for lights and highlights. It supports 4K, HDR and can record six shows while you watch a seventh, with 1TB of space for all your recordings \u2013 which is plenty given on-demand content is streamed not downloaded. Fire up the V6 on your TV and you\u2019ll immediately be struck by how old-fashioned the interface looks. The box is fast, meaning flicking between menu options, channels, scrolling through guides and other actions are quick. There\u2019s even a previous channel button to immediately flick between two channels. I would absolutely take speed over a pretty interface any day. But many actions are buried deep in menus. The TV guide looks particularly dated, and while you can create a favourites list you cannot reorder them. So you\u2019re stuck with a lot of scrolling to do if you want to see all your usual suspects. It\u2019s also fairly complicated to navigate, but once you dig a little deeper you discover that Virgin\u2019s recording and content handling is really powerful. Beyond simply setting a full season to record you can specify the quality, the channel, how many episodes to keep, whether it\u2019s new episodes only or all of them and add a little time buffer before and after the recording. When you come to the end of a recording you the V6 box offers to delete it there and then, without having to go back to the recordings menu to clear it out. Virgin actually tells you when a show was first broadcast in the TV guide too, so you don\u2019t have the problem of thinking a repeat is new. It\u2019s particularly useful for something like Midsomer Murders that has new episodes broadcast seemingly at random. Search On-demand content on the V6 box is pretty extensive too, because it supports most services and aggregates them all on to one box. You can play Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, practically every UK catchup service, plus YouTube and many other internet video services, although it\u2019s on a bring-your-own basis as any required subscriptions aren\u2019t included in your Virgin TV package. The best thing is the unified search. Tapping out the name of shows, actors or similar can be a bit tedious, but results are fast and predictive. Clicking through you can see everywhere the show or movie you\u2019re trying to find is available, both subscription and pay-per-view. Search for Peaky Blinders, for instance, will show you four seasons on Netflix and a fifth on BBC, so if like me you were late to the show you can seamlessly binge-watch them all the way through. Bookmark shows you want to watch and they\u2019ll show up in the My Shows section alongside recordings for easy access. Virgin\u2019s WishList feature also allows you to record everything by a particular actor, director or show that comes on TV, so you can build your own personal Keanu Reeves, Tom Hanks or Jason Statham playlist. You can also like or dislike shows, which teaches the V6 box what you prefer allowing it to suggest shows you might like or have missed. It works pretty well if you\u2019re dedicated to doing it.

      "body": "<p>Public toilet visits are sometimes urgent. But imagine the urgency of the presidential-nominee hopeful Hillary Clinton when she was <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-momentarily-missing-debate-stage/story?id=35867345\" title=\"\">caught short</a>, mid-commercial break, during a Democratic debate in 2015. Clinton, the lone woman on the stage, had to walk a little further to get to the women\u2019s loo than her male opponents, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley. It might have been no more than a minor inconvenience, had Clinton not been on a deadline and the toilet in question not been <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2015/12/21/this-is-why-hillary-was-late-getting-back-to-the-debate-stage/\" title=\"\">occupied when she arrived</a>. Sanders and O\u2019Malley each returned from their relatively shorter trips, leaving them time to collect themselves.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Clinton stood waiting to use the toilet. The seconds ticked away and the live televised <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tJn52wIsFY\" title=\"\">debate resumed</a>, as live televised debates must. A few moments later, Clinton strode back into the camera frame and took her podium, saying a simple \u201csorry\u201d to the 6.7 million TV viewers.</p> <p>The Boston Globe reported the next day that O\u2019Malley\u2019s deputy campaign manager, Lis Smith, got into Clinton\u2019s loo first. To the conspiratorially minded, that might read as sabotage. But let\u2019s face it: it feels like sabotage when women have to wait in loo queues and men do not. When the simplest of biological functions is made more difficult, and public spaces that much harder to navigate, all because you are a woman. You think you\u2019re just peeing when you sit down in a public toilet. You\u2019re not. Because toilets are, inescapably, a feminist issue. There are fewer public toilets every year. In the UK,<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45009337\" title=\"\"> there were 5,159 council-run toilets in 2010. That had dropped to 4,486 by 2018</a>. The decline continues annually. But even when toilets are there, they don\u2019t work for women as well as they do for men.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t about applying lipstick \u2013 a ridiculous trope that suggests lineups for women\u2019s loos are created by hordes who just want to primp and preen.

      "bodyText": "Public toilet visits are sometimes urgent. But imagine the urgency of the presidential-nominee hopeful Hillary Clinton when she was caught short, mid-commercial break, during a Democratic debate in 2015. Clinton, the lone woman on the stage, had to walk a little further to get to the women\u2019s loo than her male opponents, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley. It might have been no more than a minor inconvenience, had Clinton not been on a deadline and the toilet in question not been occupied when she arrived. Sanders and O\u2019Malley each returned from their relatively shorter trips, leaving them time to collect themselves. Meanwhile, Clinton stood waiting to use the toilet. The seconds ticked away and the live televised debate resumed, as live televised debates must. A few moments later, Clinton strode back into the camera frame and took her podium, saying a simple \u201csorry\u201d to the 6.7 million TV viewers. The Boston Globe reported the next day that O\u2019Malley\u2019s deputy campaign manager, Lis Smith, got into Clinton\u2019s loo first. To the conspiratorially minded, that might read as sabotage. But let\u2019s face it: it feels like sabotage when women have to wait in loo queues and men do not. When the simplest of biological functions is made more difficult, and public spaces that much harder to navigate, all because you are a woman. You think you\u2019re just peeing when you sit down in a public toilet. You\u2019re not. Because toilets are, inescapably, a feminist issue. There are fewer public toilets every year. In the UK, there were 5,159 council-run toilets in 2010. That had dropped to 4,486 by 2018. The decline continues annually. But even when toilets are there, they don\u2019t work for women as well as they do for men. This isn\u2019t about applying lipstick \u2013 a ridiculous trope that suggests lineups for women\u2019s loos are created by hordes who just want to primp and preen. There are simply more of us in there, more of the time. Women empty their bladders more frequently than men and take longer \u2013 an average start-to-finish time of 60 seconds for men, but 90 for women. Women also visit the toilet for more reasons, such as changing tampons, and we care more often for children or adults who need our assistance. Based on bleeding and bladders and babies, women need two to three times more provision than men, just to even out the waiting times. But in so many traditional public toilet setups, perversely, men often enjoy more facilities than women. When you can fit a cubicle and five urinals on the men\u2019s side, you can only fit three cubicles in the same space on the women\u2019s. This means not only that women lose hours of their lives waiting in queues for the toilet, but that they cannot make use of public space in the same way as men. This legs-crossed conundrum is no accident. It\u2019s a failure of planning and design. When loads of men design the world, doing little to find out about others\u2019 experiences, the world ends up made mostly for those men. Intentional? Nah. No freshly minted architecture or planning student thinks: I can\u2019t wait to get out there in the working world so I can really screw over women in the built environment. But here\u2019s where the sabotage lies: the solution to women\u2019s public toilet woes is well known. It\u2019s potty parity \u2013 a legislated or codified levelling of the peeing field through 2:1 or 3:1 ratios in favour of women. In the UK, potty parity remains a mere optimistic guideline of the British Standards Institution. In Canada and the US, in jurisdictions where it\u2019s the law, potty parity is often required only for new buildings or in significant renovations of older ones.

In June, after a visitor to Zurich airport tweeted a photo of women queueing for the loo, inquiring politely when this would be dealt with, the airport authority responded with indignant insistence that the architects had \u201cincluded enough space for the women\u201d.

Fire conditions on Thursday gave emergency services workers a brief respite and the chance to build stronger containment lines around many of the 75 bushfires still burning across the state. But the weekend forecast is grim: dry storms and a heatwave in the south east of the state. The Bureau of Meteorology says ongoing dry conditions that have fuelled the recent fires could continue for months in Queensland. \u201cThe main story with these storms could be the dry lightning potentially igniting further fires,\u201d BoM national operations leader Richard Wardle told reporters in Brisbane on Thursday. \u201cIn terms of the longer-range outlook for rainfall it is looking like it\u2019s going to stay dry.

Nazi troops had rushed south to occupy Italy when, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/benito-mussolini\" title=\"\">Mussolini\u2019s arrest in July 1943</a>, the new government declared that it was now siding with the allies, not the axis powers.</p> <p>The German reaction was ruthless: they killed 6,000 Italian soldiers of the Acqui division in the Cephalonia massacre and more than 1,000 men in sinking the Roma battleship. Nazi paratroopers rescued Mussolini from his mountain-top prison and installed him as a puppet head-of-state in the so-called Sal\u00f2 republic on the shores of Lake Garda. That meant the partisans weren\u2019t only fighting a war of liberation against foreigners, but were one side of a brutal civil war between Italians: as the allies laboriously advanced from the south, the partisans \u2013 poorly armed, ill fed and often freezing in mountain hideouts \u2013 were taking on the die-hard followers of il Duce.</p> <p>Although it\u2019s a well-known story, it has rarely \u2013 outside Italy \u2013 been told from the viewpoint of the women involved. Caroline Moorehead does so through the intersecting lives of four female friends in Turin who became <em>staffette</em> (couriers) in the resistance, delivering intelligence, letters and weaponry: Bianca (a communist law graduate and factory agitator); Silvia (a doctor); Frida (a literature graduate); and Ada (the widow of the anti-fascist Piero Gobetti).</p> <p>Two of the women were from the Waldensian community (Italy\u2019s centuries-old Protestant minority) and two were in stable, but unmarried, relationships.

Most of them are insured. It\u2019s clear that despite health insurance, there are many, many people incurring costs not being covered by their insurance,\u201d said Himmelstein. \u201cMedical debt is incredibly common, it\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/01/24/511269991/medical-debt-is-top-reason-consumers-hear-from-collection-agencies\">main cause</a> of calls from collection agencies, and the vast majority of people with it have insurance,\u201d said Himmelstein, lead author of the <a href=\"https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304901\">study</a><em> </em>Medical Bankruptcy: Still Common Despite the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/millennials-rack-up-the-most-medical-debt-and-more-frequently\">One out of every six Americans</a> has an unpaid medical bill on their credit report, amounting to $81bn in debt nationwide, while <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/number-of-americans-without-insurance-rises-in-2018/\">about one in 12 Americans</a> went without any medical insurance throughout 2018. Even as many Americans struggle to afford health insurance coverage in the first place, those that have it are not insulated from facing massive debt due to medical bills.</p> <p>\u201cI have insurance through my job but it has a high premium and high deductible. I have to pay $450 a month. When you think about living paycheck to paycheck, $450 is a lot of money. I\u2019m barely making it. Some bills don\u2019t get paid every month,\u201d said Mary Cross of Detroit, Michigan, who has filed for bankruptcy twice since early 2013 when she was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia, required lung surgery and was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m currently struggling to stay afloat now due to having surgery this past January,\u201d added Cross, 51. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting constant calls from the billing department at the hospital where I had surgery.\u201d</p> <p>In Savannah, Georgia, a 35-year-old man who requested to remain anonymous to avoid being associated with a bankruptcy, recently found himself homeless and jobless due to prolonged hospital stays and hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical debt.</p> <p>A type 1 diabetic for years, he had to reduce his work hours for a cellular retail store when trouble regulating his blood sugar resulted in a toe amputation in April 2019.</p> <p>\u201cI had to cut my work hours so bills were harder to pay. But in July 2019 I was admitted to the hospital again and I was fired from my job because I was in the hospital. I lost my insurance. They amputated my leg, which means I still can\u2019t work,\u201d he said.</p> <p>When he lost his job due to the prolonged hospital stay and leg amputation, his employer offered Cobra, a health insurance program for employees who lose their job or have a reduction in work hours, but he couldn\u2019t afford it. He is currently working on trying to file bankruptcy to release the medical debt he\u2019s accrued from amputations this year and he lost his house in October 2019 as a result.</p> <p>\u201cI have amassed over $400,000 in medical bills I need to pay, and still have at least six months before I get a disability hearing. So I owe over $400,000 in medical bills, have lost my house and I live on the street now, with no end in sight,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7e89e43784275d7f8f9919332bded113821144ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e89e43784275d7f8f9919332bded113821144ba/40_0_462_578/400.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Hillman-medical bankruptcy\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessica Hillman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just outside of Chicago, Illinois, Jessica Hillman filed for bankruptcy in 2016 due to medical debt accrued from battling a seizure disorder, despite having health insurance coverage for the majority of her treatment.</p> <p>\u201cI had thousands of dollars in various medical debt which made the majority of my claim. The last bill I got that really pushed me toward the bankruptcy was for a routine lab test that my insurance refused to approve because of a billing mistake. That bill was about a thousand dollars,\u201d Hillman said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t work and had no way to pay these.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, Hillman was receiving several collection notices in the mail for past hospital stays and tests amounting to several thousand dollars, often having no knowledge of the bills that health insurance didn\u2019t cover until receiving the collection notices.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest hurdles you face as a patient is just the sheer confusion of the process. You think you just show up and present your card, sometimes pay a copay, and that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t expect all these plan limitations and authorizations,\u201d Hillman added. \u201cWhat are you going to do if your authorization gets denied? You don\u2019t really have a choice to not go get care. All these processes that are in the finest of fine print. And sometimes it feels like you are literally paying for nothing.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s clear that despite health insurance, there are many, many people incurring costs not being covered by their insurance,\u201d said Himmelstein. \u201cMedical debt is incredibly common, it\u2019s the main cause of calls from collection agencies, and the vast majority of people with it have insurance,\u201d said Himmelstein, lead author of the study Medical Bankruptcy: Still Common Despite the Affordable Care Act. One out of every six Americans has an unpaid medical bill on their credit report, amounting to $81bn in debt nationwide, while about one in 12 Americans went without any medical insurance throughout 2018. Even as many Americans struggle to afford health insurance coverage in the first place, those that have it are not insulated from facing massive debt due to medical bills. \u201cI have insurance through my job but it has a high premium and high deductible. I have to pay $450 a month. When you think about living paycheck to paycheck, $450 is a lot of money. I\u2019m barely making it. Some bills don\u2019t get paid every month,\u201d said Mary Cross of Detroit, Michigan, who has filed for bankruptcy twice since early 2013 when she was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia, required lung surgery and was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease. \u201cI\u2019m currently struggling to stay afloat now due to having surgery this past January,\u201d added Cross, 51. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting constant calls from the billing department at the hospital where I had surgery.\u201d In Savannah, Georgia, a 35-year-old man who requested to remain anonymous to avoid being associated with a bankruptcy, recently found himself homeless and jobless due to prolonged hospital stays and hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical debt. A type 1 diabetic for years, he had to reduce his work hours for a cellular retail store when trouble regulating his blood sugar resulted in a toe amputation in April 2019. \u201cI had to cut my work hours so bills were harder to pay. But in July 2019 I was admitted to the hospital again and I was fired from my job because I was in the hospital. I lost my insurance. They amputated my leg, which means I still can\u2019t work,\u201d he said. When he lost his job due to the prolonged hospital stay and leg amputation, his employer offered Cobra, a health insurance program for employees who lose their job or have a reduction in work hours, but he couldn\u2019t afford it. He is currently working on trying to file bankruptcy to release the medical debt he\u2019s accrued from amputations this year and he lost his house in October 2019 as a result. \u201cI have amassed over $400,000 in medical bills I need to pay, and still have at least six months before I get a disability hearing. So I owe over $400,000 in medical bills, have lost my house and I live on the street now, with no end in sight,\u201d he said. Just outside of Chicago, Illinois, Jessica Hillman filed for bankruptcy in 2016 due to medical debt accrued from battling a seizure disorder, despite having health insurance coverage for the majority of her treatment. \u201cI had thousands of dollars in various medical debt which made the majority of my claim. The last bill I got that really pushed me toward the bankruptcy was for a routine lab test that my insurance refused to approve because of a billing mistake. That bill was about a thousand dollars,\u201d Hillman said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t work and had no way to pay these.\u201d At the time, Hillman was receiving several collection notices in the mail for past hospital stays and tests amounting to several thousand dollars, often having no knowledge of the bills that health insurance didn\u2019t cover until receiving the collection notices. \u201cOne of the biggest hurdles you face as a patient is just the sheer confusion of the process. You think you just show up and present your card, sometimes pay a copay, and that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t expect all these plan limitations and authorizations,\u201d Hillman added. \u201cWhat are you going to do if your authorization gets denied? You don\u2019t really have a choice to not go get care. All these processes that are in the finest of fine print. And sometimes it feels like you are literally paying for nothing.\u201d",

The only devices I use in my home are a six-year-old Toshiba Satellite L870 laptop and a Samsung tablet. I use them for email, web browsing and watching BBC iPlayer, but not much else. The laptop runs Windows 10 and works well enough so I don\u2019t have any immediate plans to replace it.</p> <p>If I revert to ordinary broadband, will I notice a reduction in performance in either device? <strong>Angela</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>You should notice a difference, because your \u201cfibre\u201d connection is probably about five times faster than you will get from ADSL2. However, for your purposes, the difference may not matter.</p> <p>A few things drive the need for fast broadband. Today, the main one is usually a desire to stream movies from Netflix and similar services in good quality without lots of annoying pauses for buffering. It\u2019s almost essential if you want to watch 4K or ultra high definition (UHD) video instead of HD (720p) or Full HD (1080p).</p> <p>Families also need faster broadband when they are competing for bandwidth. It\u2019s quite common to have people streaming different movies or TV programmes, watching YouTube videos and playing games at the same time. Gamers usually prefer fibre-style connections because they are more responsive: there\u2019s less latency or lagging. People who still download large files will obviously prefer high-speed connections, too.</p> <p>People who work from home definitely benefit from having responsive, fibre-style broadband. Aside from the advantages of much faster upload speeds \u2013 handy when you are sending files back to the office \u2013 the connections are more consistent and more reliable than ADSL. It\u2019s very frustrating if your broadband connection drops just when you absolutely need it to work.</p> <p>When I had ADSL at home, I always had a backup connection in the form of a laptop with a MiFi cellular dongle. After I upgraded to BT Infinity, I stopped bothering.</p> <p>From your email, you don\u2019t seem to fit into any of the needy categories. Even 5Mbps ADSL can handle email, web browsing and BBC iPlayer, though web pages won\u2019t download as quickly.</p> <p>And you won\u2019t be alone. According to Ofcom, the UK\u2019s communications regulator, about 95% of UK homes and offices could have superfast broadband if they wanted it. When Ofcom last surveyed the market in November 2018, only 66% of homes had taken the option. No doubt the number is higher today, but more than a quarter of British homes could still be using ADSL.</p> <p>However, Ofcom\u2019s 2018 Home Broadband Report (<a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/147332/home-broadband-report-2018.pdf\">PDF</a>) noted that average home download speeds had increased by 18% over the previous year to 54.2Mbps, with 16% of homes now getting 300Mbps from BT and 365Mbps from Virgin Media. Online services will inevitably cater for the growing majority. Users getting 10Mbps or less risk becoming second-class citizens.</p> <h2>Copper switch-off</h2> <p>Clearly, ADSL is not the future. You can downgrade your internet connection today, but the change will be temporary. Sooner or later, the analogue phone network will be <a href=\"https://www.ftthcouncil.eu/documents/Reports/2019/Copper_switch-off_analysis_27022019.pdf\">switched off</a>, much as the old analogue TV signal was switched off in 2012. You will then have to go back to a fibre-based service, on a date that will probably depend on exactly where you live.</p> <p>Some countries are well ahead of us. For example, Estonia has already closed most if not all of its copper exchanges, and many Australian users have been given 18 months to switch to the country\u2019s national broadband network (NBN). In the UK, telecoms companies have been <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/bt-leads-30bn-push-for-copper-broadband-switchover-deadline-11813294\">discussing a 2027 switch-off date</a>. The \u00a330bn plan will need government support, but fibre will become as important economically as canals, railways and motorways were in their day.</p> <h2>Speed matters</h2> <p>One of the problems with delivering broadband over copper cables is that internet service providers (ISPs) cannot guarantee any particular speed. It depends on too many variables, including the distance from the telephone exchange, the quality of the wiring, the number of joints in the wiring, the faceplate in the home, the quality of the router, and the time of day. Broadband is a finite resource, so services are slower during peak times.</p> <p>Previously, ISPs quoted the speeds that the various technologies could provide, whether that was ADSL, ADSL2+, FTTC, cable, wireless or whatever. This created frustration because only around 10% of customers actually got those speeds.</p> <p>Last year, the Advertising Standards Authority introduced <a href=\"https://www.asa.org.uk/news/new-standard-on-broadband-speed-claims-in-ads-comes-into-force-today.html\">new rules</a> that said speed claims \u201cshould be based on the download speed available to at least 50% of customers at peak time (8pm-10pm) and described in ads as \u2018average\u2019\u201d. As a result, ISPs stopped quoting 14-17Mbps for ADSL2+ and started quoting 10-11Mbps. That is a fair reflection of actual speeds, but of course, millions of people will get below-average speeds. You could end up being one of them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1297977b4a9a6898ba7572386f205fcf13f14c25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1297977b4a9a6898ba7572386f205fcf13f14c25/82_0_3333_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BT Openreach van\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many ISPs are delivering exactly the same broadband because they all use services supplied by BT\u2019s Openreach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Choose a supplier</h2> <p>You can increase your chances of getting a reasonable speed by becoming an informed buyer. Start by checking your local telephone exchange with SamKnows\u2019s <a href=\"https://availability.samknows.com/broadband/broadband_checker\">UK Broadband Availability Checker</a>. Type in your postcode or phone number and SamKnows will tell you which companies offer broadband in your area and how they deliver it.</p> <p>In some areas, most ISPs are actually delivering exactly the same broadband because they are all using BT Wholesale services supplied by BT\u2019s Openreach. They are all likely to run at roughly the same speed. You might get something better by switching to an ISP that has installed its own equipment via the local loop unbundling (LLU) scheme. In my local exchange, that includes Vodafone, TalkTalk and Zen. Their services might be faster or slower than BT Wholesale\u2019s, but there\u2019s more of a chance they will be different.</p> <p>Note that joining or leaving LLU services is not always as easy as it is supposed to be, and involves an engineer changing connections in the exchange. Make sure you are not being charged for a new line. Also, you may have to pay a <a href=\"https://www.choose.co.uk/guide/reconnect-phoneline-costs-how-to.html\">reconnection fee</a> if and when you take the \u201creturn to donor\u201d option and go back to BT.</p> <p>Ideally, choose an ISP that subscribes to Ofcom\u2019s voluntary <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/advice/broadband-speeds-code-practice\">code of conduct</a>. This includes BT, EE, Plusnet, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media. These ISP should give you an <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/advice/broadband-speeds-code-practice\">estimated speed</a> in advance, based on testing your line. If they can\u2019t deliver the minimum guaranteed speed within 30 days, you can quit the contract without being penalised.</p> <p>Otherwise, Ofcom has some <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/quality-of-service\">consumer advice</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/costs-and-billing/switching/checklist-when-taking-out-new-phone-or-broadband-contract\">a useful checklist</a> of things you need to establish before taking out a new broadband contract.</p> <h2>Talk to your ISP</h2> <p>Today, few UK users have their broadband delivered by fibre to their premises (<a href=\"https://www.broadbandgenie.co.uk/broadband/help/fttp-fttc-fibre-broadband-guide\">FTTP</a>). If you had speeds of 330Mbps to 1Gbps, you would know about it. Instead, most of us have FTTC, which is fibre delivered to the local street cabinet. When it leaves the cabinet, this \u201cfibre broadband\u201d is delivered over old copper wires using fast but short-range <a href=\"https://www.versatek.com/blog/most-frequently-asked-vdsl2-questions/\">VDSL2</a>, which used to require a separate modem but is now built into the router. This is how BT Infinity works.</p> <p>As growing numbers of users have switched from ADSL to FTTC, this has become the most competitive part of the market, and it\u2019s where you\u2019ll find the best deals. Special offers mean you can sometimes get superfast FTTC services cheaper than slow ADSL services, so you may not be able to save as much as you think.</p> <p>After researching the alternatives but before switching, talk to your ISP\u2019s customer retention unit. Make a good case and they may be willing to match or even beat the competition, though this will usually involve signing up for a new 18-month contract.</p> <p>When negotiating a new deal, you don\u2019t have to limit it to broadband. Major ISPs offer lots of services including broadband, voice calls, mobile phone networks and television services. You may be able to save more money on a bundle than you would by downgrading to ADSL.</p> <p><strong>Have you got a question? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com</strong></p> <p><br><br></p>",

For example, Estonia has already closed most if not all of its copper exchanges, and many Australian users have been given 18 months to switch to the country\u2019s national broadband network (NBN). In the UK, telecoms companies have been discussing a 2027 switch-off date. The \u00a330bn plan will need government support, but fibre will become as important economically as canals, railways and motorways were in their day. Speed matters One of the problems with delivering broadband over copper cables is that internet service providers (ISPs) cannot guarantee any particular speed. It depends on too many variables, including the distance from the telephone exchange, the quality of the wiring, the number of joints in the wiring, the faceplate in the home, the quality of the router, and the time of day. Broadband is a finite resource, so services are slower during peak times. Previously, ISPs quoted the speeds that the various technologies could provide, whether that was ADSL, ADSL2+, FTTC, cable, wireless or whatever. This created frustration because only around 10% of customers actually got those speeds. Last year, the Advertising Standards Authority introduced new rules that said speed claims \u201cshould be based on the download speed available to at least 50% of customers at peak time (8pm-10pm) and described in ads as \u2018average\u2019\u201d. As a result, ISPs stopped quoting 14-17Mbps for ADSL2+ and started quoting 10-11Mbps. That is a fair reflection of actual speeds, but of course, millions of people will get below-average speeds. You could end up being one of them. Choose a supplier You can increase your chances of getting a reasonable speed by becoming an informed buyer. Start by checking your local telephone exchange with SamKnows\u2019s UK Broadband Availability Checker. Type in your postcode or phone number and SamKnows will tell you which companies offer broadband in your area and how they deliver it. In some areas, most ISPs are actually delivering exactly the same broadband because they are all using BT Wholesale services supplied by BT\u2019s Openreach. They are all likely to run at roughly the same speed. You might get something better by switching to an ISP that has installed its own equipment via the local loop unbundling (LLU) scheme. In my local exchange, that includes Vodafone, TalkTalk and Zen. Their services might be faster or slower than BT Wholesale\u2019s, but there\u2019s more of a chance they will be different. Note that joining or leaving LLU services is not always as easy as it is supposed to be, and involves an engineer changing connections in the exchange. Make sure you are not being charged for a new line. Also, you may have to pay a reconnection fee if and when you take the \u201creturn to donor\u201d option and go back to BT. Ideally, choose an ISP that subscribes to Ofcom\u2019s voluntary code of conduct. This includes BT, EE, Plusnet, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media. These ISP should give you an estimated speed in advance, based on testing your line. If they can\u2019t deliver the minimum guaranteed speed within 30 days, you can quit the contract without being penalised. Otherwise, Ofcom has some consumer advice and a useful checklist of things you need to establish before taking out a new broadband contract. Talk to your ISP Today, few UK users have their broadband delivered by fibre to their premises (FTTP). If you had speeds of 330Mbps to 1Gbps, you would know about it. Instead, most of us have FTTC, which is fibre delivered to the local street cabinet. When it leaves the cabinet, this \u201cfibre broadband\u201d is delivered over old copper wires using fast but short-range VDSL2, which used to require a separate modem but is now built into the router. This is how BT Infinity works. As growing numbers of users have switched from ADSL to FTTC, this has become the most competitive part of the market, and it\u2019s where you\u2019ll find the best deals. Special offers mean you can sometimes get superfast FTTC services cheaper than slow ADSL services, so you may not be able to save as much as you think. After researching the alternatives but before switching, talk to your ISP\u2019s customer retention unit. Make a good case and they may be willing to match or even beat the competition, though this will usually involve signing up for a new 18-month contract. When negotiating a new deal, you don\u2019t have to limit it to broadband. Major ISPs offer lots of services including broadband, voice calls, mobile phone networks and television services. You may be able to save more money on a bundle than you would by downgrading to ADSL. Have you got a question? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>While celebrities and Instagram influencers seem able to shed their pregnancy weight within a few months (while cheerfully chronicling the process on an hourly basis) the reality is quite different for most women. I didn\u2019t bounce back, I sort of crawled, and it\u2019s hard not to feel at a loss when you\u2019re so tired even looking at your trainers feels like work.</p> <p>Between the lack of sleep and having to recover from one of the most physically demanding experiences the human body can go through, just leaving the house is an achievement in itself, let alone exercising. While the NHS recommends waiting until after your six-week postnatal check before doing anything strenuous (longer if you\u2019ve had a caesarean or complicated delivery), experts also recommend regular activity to keep you fit, help your body recover and possibly prevent postnatal depression.</p> <p>That\u2019s all well and good, but being able to hit the gym when you\u2019re trying to juggle childcare and everyday upkeep often feels unrealistic. It\u2019s been almost a year since my daughter was born, and I still struggle to find time to do more than a brisk walk to the shops for more nappies to get my heart rate up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8e5e3e3e964b5363d14b63e5ddada5fadb3aa8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8e5e3e3e964b5363d14b63e5ddada5fadb3aa8b/0_800_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Switch Ring Fit \u2013 one jogcon pad goes in a leg band, while the other is slotted into the ring controller.

Both work together to monitor your movements.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/nintendo\">Nintendo</a> released Ringcon for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/nintendo-switch\">Nintendo Switch</a> in October, a unique game controller designed to get you exercising at home, it felt as if I\u2019d found a potential solution. The first game to support the device, Ring Fit Adventure, features a range of traditional, guided exercises, mini-tasks and a story mode that sees you partner up with a talking ring to take on the dark influence of the insanely ripped dragon, Dragaux.</p> <p>The package includes a Ring-con \u2013 a resistance hoop for one controller to slide into \u2013 and a leg strap for the other. It works by using sensors within the controllers that help track your movements as you exercise. It\u2019s a surprisingly sturdy piece of kit that genuinely feels like exercise equipment despite its unusual shape. However, at \u00a365, it\u2019s a pretty big investment and, if you don\u2019t own a Nintendo Switch, you\u2019ll need to factor that into the cost as well.</p> <p>While I had to find a safe spot far from baby\u2019s reach to store the ring and leg strap, having it at home felt like a convenient way to fit in a workout without having to worry about the babycare logistics of going to the gym. You can set your fitness level to determine how hard the exercises are, though starting with the lower-impact casual settings is a good idea as your ligaments are still more flexible after birth so are at increased risk of injury if you stretch too much. It was enough to get my heart racing without being too far out of my comfort zone.</p> <p>Feeling a little silly about squatting while holding a hoop, I drew my curtains so that no one could see, but the in-game exercise guide is clear and reassuring, and that initial embarrassment faded quickly. The adventure mode sees you jogging through various areas and occasionally stopping to battle monsters by using various exercises such as knee lifts and chair pose to deal damage. The exercises feel like a mix between an aerobics and a pilates class, and, with the controllers tracking your movements and rumbling with each rep, you get a good amount of feedback to keep you on track. It feels way more effective than just following a video class online thanks to that guidance, and the gaming element made me feel as if I had achieved something even after a short session.</p> <p>There\u2019s also the option to customise your workout or quickly access \u201csets\u201d that focus on certain areas of your body. I found the back and shoulders sets particularly useful because I\u2019ve been dealing with back pain \u2013 a common ailment after having a child. It hasn\u2019t been a miracle cure, but it has eased after stretching these areas out.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gO6fw0GU-fE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gO6fw0GU-fE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>What has surprised me most about using the Ring Fit has been the mental benefits. I had gone into this hoping to find a more convenient way to shift some baby weight, so I wasn\u2019t expecting to have a personal epiphany about my own body. No matter how many times you hear how wonderful growing a tiny human inside you is, it still feels totally surreal. The body you\u2019ve known your whole life starts changing whether or not you want it to.

      "bodyText": "While celebrities and Instagram influencers seem able to shed their pregnancy weight within a few months (while cheerfully chronicling the process on an hourly basis) the reality is quite different for most women. I didn\u2019t bounce back, I sort of crawled, and it\u2019s hard not to feel at a loss when you\u2019re so tired even looking at your trainers feels like work. Between the lack of sleep and having to recover from one of the most physically demanding experiences the human body can go through, just leaving the house is an achievement in itself, let alone exercising. While the NHS recommends waiting until after your six-week postnatal check before doing anything strenuous (longer if you\u2019ve had a caesarean or complicated delivery), experts also recommend regular activity to keep you fit, help your body recover and possibly prevent postnatal depression. That\u2019s all well and good, but being able to hit the gym when you\u2019re trying to juggle childcare and everyday upkeep often feels unrealistic. It\u2019s been almost a year since my daughter was born, and I still struggle to find time to do more than a brisk walk to the shops for more nappies to get my heart rate up. So when Nintendo released Ringcon for the Nintendo Switch in October, a unique game controller designed to get you exercising at home, it felt as if I\u2019d found a potential solution. The first game to support the device, Ring Fit Adventure, features a range of traditional, guided exercises, mini-tasks and a story mode that sees you partner up with a talking ring to take on the dark influence of the insanely ripped dragon, Dragaux. The package includes a Ring-con \u2013 a resistance hoop for one controller to slide into \u2013 and a leg strap for the other. It works by using sensors within the controllers that help track your movements as you exercise. It\u2019s a surprisingly sturdy piece of kit that genuinely feels like exercise equipment despite its unusual shape. However, at \u00a365, it\u2019s a pretty big investment and, if you don\u2019t own a Nintendo Switch, you\u2019ll need to factor that into the cost as well. While I had to find a safe spot far from baby\u2019s reach to store the ring and leg strap, having it at home felt like a convenient way to fit in a workout without having to worry about the babycare logistics of going to the gym. You can set your fitness level to determine how hard the exercises are, though starting with the lower-impact casual settings is a good idea as your ligaments are still more flexible after birth so are at increased risk of injury if you stretch too much. It was enough to get my heart racing without being too far out of my comfort zone. Feeling a little silly about squatting while holding a hoop, I drew my curtains so that no one could see, but the in-game exercise guide is clear and reassuring, and that initial embarrassment faded quickly. The adventure mode sees you jogging through various areas and occasionally stopping to battle monsters by using various exercises such as knee lifts and chair pose to deal damage. The exercises feel like a mix between an aerobics and a pilates class, and, with the controllers tracking your movements and rumbling with each rep, you get a good amount of feedback to keep you on track. It feels way more effective than just following a video class online thanks to that guidance, and the gaming element made me feel as if I had achieved something even after a short session. There\u2019s also the option to customise your workout or quickly access \u201csets\u201d that focus on certain areas of your body. I found the back and shoulders sets particularly useful because I\u2019ve been dealing with back pain \u2013 a common ailment after having a child. It hasn\u2019t been a miracle cure, but it has eased after stretching these areas out. What has surprised me most about using the Ring Fit has been the mental benefits. I had gone into this hoping to find a more convenient way to shift some baby weight, so I wasn\u2019t expecting to have a personal epiphany about my own body. No matter how many times you hear how wonderful growing a tiny human inside you is, it still feels totally surreal. The body you\u2019ve known your whole life starts changing whether or not you want it to. It\u2019s suddenly not just yours any more and that\u2019s a huge thing to get your head around as your feet swell inexplicably and all of your ligaments soften to accommodate your expanding bump. Even after the baby arrives your body is not your own \u2013 it\u2019s used for sustenance, sleeping on or as a mode of transportation as you dutifully carry them around. Squeezing in a 10-minute workout with the Ring Fit between nap times helped me feel as if I was finally reclaiming my body. It was moving in the ways that I willed it to rather than just responding to the needs of my child. After giving birth, my self-confidence and body image has taken a huge knock. Appearing at the gym or jogging in public feels unapproachable right now, but being able to have guided exercise within the privacy of my own home has given me a gentle kick to start getting fit in a more manageable way. Even if I don\u2019t lose any weight on my adventures with Dragaux, reclaiming that sense of control over my own body has been invaluable.",

      "body": "<p>How long do you think you will be doing this for?\u201d my dad asked me last week. He was referring to my amateur competitive powerlifting, which involves lifting squat, bench and deadlift at the heaviest weight you can handle. \u201cUntil I die, or sustain an injury which means that I can\u2019t lift again,\u201d I replied. His arched eyebrows spoke volumes.</p> <p>My parents have always been glad that I keep myself fit \u2013 my dad has been lifting weights most of his life, and is an avid cyclist. But they have no idea how to process why I\u2019ve decided to take up what seems to them like a dangerous, overly masculine sport at the age of 38. On the one hand they are proud, but on the other hand their brains can\u2019t compute that I can handle a 125kg deadlift or a 100kg squat, and my back hasn\u2019t snapped in two yet. They\u2019re also struggling \u2013 if they\u2019re being honest \u2013 with the fact that my body has changed and become more muscular, and that I don\u2019t seem to care or show no sign of stopping. Other people have commented on my physique: \u201cYou look great but don\u2019t get any bigger\u201d or \u201cWah! It\u2019s the wrestler!\u201d (Wrong sport, but I understood the sentiment).</p> <p>It\u2019s not just South Asian women who face incomprehension as to why they would take up powerlifting. But being female and South Asian definitely makes things harder and lonelier. South Asian women are subject to all the same conditioning as other women when it comes to our bodies: the pursuit of slimness over strength. But we often have added layers to contend with: the sustained stereotype of South Asian women depicted in western TV and film as oppressed by their men: demure, obedient and soft. While we have the likes of actor and director Mindy Kaling breaking this mould, it currently doesn\u2019t come close to representing the actual spectrum of South Asian women I know.

      "bodyText": "How long do you think you will be doing this for?\u201d my dad asked me last week. He was referring to my amateur competitive powerlifting, which involves lifting squat, bench and deadlift at the heaviest weight you can handle. \u201cUntil I die, or sustain an injury which means that I can\u2019t lift again,\u201d I replied. His arched eyebrows spoke volumes. My parents have always been glad that I keep myself fit \u2013 my dad has been lifting weights most of his life, and is an avid cyclist. But they have no idea how to process why I\u2019ve decided to take up what seems to them like a dangerous, overly masculine sport at the age of 38. On the one hand they are proud, but on the other hand their brains can\u2019t compute that I can handle a 125kg deadlift or a 100kg squat, and my back hasn\u2019t snapped in two yet. They\u2019re also struggling \u2013 if they\u2019re being honest \u2013 with the fact that my body has changed and become more muscular, and that I don\u2019t seem to care or show no sign of stopping. Other people have commented on my physique: \u201cYou look great but don\u2019t get any bigger\u201d or \u201cWah! It\u2019s the wrestler!\u201d (Wrong sport, but I understood the sentiment). It\u2019s not just South Asian women who face incomprehension as to why they would take up powerlifting. But being female and South Asian definitely makes things harder and lonelier. South Asian women are subject to all the same conditioning as other women when it comes to our bodies: the pursuit of slimness over strength. But we often have added layers to contend with: the sustained stereotype of South Asian women depicted in western TV and film as oppressed by their men: demure, obedient and soft. While we have the likes of actor and director Mindy Kaling breaking this mould, it currently doesn\u2019t come close to representing the actual spectrum of South Asian women I know. And the expectation from our families \u2013 even liberal, educated and feminist ones such as mine \u2013 that your destiny includes settling down with a man, and shaping yourself to be as attractive as possible. Role-modelling outside of these narrow paradigms matters.

Pissay\u2019s win is impressive for several reasons \u2013 the first being that motorsports training is expensive and she funded it entirely herself. But the second is that she comes from a conservative family in which doing an irregular job is taboo. \u201cWhen I wanted to take up racing professionally, there were a lot of questions asked around, like, if this was normal,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Claim Labour will close the gender pay gap by 2030. Background The Labour party is pledging to get rid of the gap between the pay of male and female workers. It cites a mean gap of 13.1% between full-time employees. The package of measures behind this includes \u201ca real living wage\u201d of \u00a310 an hour, national pay scales for jobs that are predominantly done by women, and extending gender pay reporting to all companies with more than 50 workers. Reality Figures from the Office for National Statistics are for the median pay gap, which is not skewed as much by very high or very low earners. They show for full-time workers the gap is 8.9% and has only fallen by 0.6 percentage points since 2012. At that rate it would take more than Labour\u2019s 11-year target-time to close. But the proposed measures are similar to those called for by equality campaigners. The Fawcett Society wants more employers to pay the living wage and better rewards for jobs typically staffed by women. It has also recommended reform to parental leave and mandatory equal pay audits. Labour\u2019s plans include extending free childcare and fines for companies that fail to reach equality. However, it is not clear when either would start. One reason women take home less than men is that they are more likely to do part-time jobs \u2013 when these roles are included the pay gap is 17.3%. Labour\u2019s childcare pledge offers 30 hours a week, which does not cover a full-time role but would make one more financially viable. Ren\u00e9e Adams, professor of finance at the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford University, said the target was \u201cvery ambitious \u2013 there is no way that is achievable\u201d. Adams said that, despite pay-gap reporting, there was still a lack of transparency, allowing people in the same jobs to be paid different salaries. She added that a lack of clear data on why people leave jobs or fail to progress into higher paid jobs made it hard to address all of the issues. Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said that the pay gap could only be closed by 2030 if there were moves to tackle hidden pay discrimination. \u201cThis is why we have to change the law to give women the right to know what a male colleague earns if they suspect they are being paid unequally for doing equal work.\u201d Verdict Labour\u2019s policies will speed up the pace of change but closing the gap completely by 2030 seems unlikely without some additional measures.",

Dr Rob Weisskirch, professor of human development at California State University Monterey Bay, says his research shows that sexting is actually most common within a committed relationship: \u201cIt\u2019s just a part of the behaviours, nowadays, in how we communicate with our romantic partners.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a way to do it that\u2019s clunky and really not hot \u2013 and there\u2019s a way to make it actually erotic</p> <footer> <cite>Madeleine Holden</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet even as it becomes more commonplace, the persistent framing of sexting is that straight men send images to women who did not ask for them, and straight women send images to men who ask for them.

In fact, studies have shown them to record similarly diverse responses when asked about their sexting behaviours. \u201cMen can sometimes feel uncomfortable sexting, just like women do.

Though it may not be conscious, the intent might at least be partly reciprocity, he says: \u201cI imagine some of it is, \u2018We\u2019re going to both be in this together \u2013 if I\u2019m going to send something, I\u2019m going to want something in return.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to separate any truth in the assumption that men are more responsive to visual stimulus than women due to decades of sexism that punished female sexuality, says Temple \u2013 though his suspicion is that it is mostly, if not entirely, a product of \u201cold-school thinking\u201d: \u201cMy guess is that women and girls get turned on just as much as guys get turned on from sexual imagery.\u201d</p> <p>Holden had initially intended for Critique My Dick Pic to interrogate this. But as her inbox filled up with submissions, she came to realise that the reality was far more diverse than she could have ever imagined. \u201cI was getting pictures of women with dicks, hearing from men who loved to see dicks.\u201d Trans people in particular told her how meaningful it was to see themselves represented in an erotic space.</p> <p>She started to suspect that even straight men were not being well served by the assumption of them as undiscerning consumers: \u201cMaybe they are more likely to see a picture of a vagina and think the same thing they say about pizza \u2013 \u2018if it\u2019s good, it\u2019s good, and if it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s still pretty good\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>It is as the sex educator and writer Emily Nagoski writes in her 2015 book Come As You Are: \u201cVariety may be the only truly universal characteristic of human sexuality.\u201d To the question \u201care men\u2019s and women\u2019s sexualities the same, or are they different?\u201d she answers: \u201cYes.\u201d<strong> </strong>They are \u201cmade of the same parts, organised differently\u201d and, though there are some biological differences, \u201cthere is at least as much variability within those groups as there is between those groups\u201d.</p> <p>Women\u2019s sexual response is more sensitive than men\u2019s to context, characterised by Nagoski as external circumstances and present mental state. This is partly a result of biological difference, yes \u2013 but it is also learned. Nagoski writes that \u2013 without the \u201cobligingly obvious physiological response\u201d of an erection to link to external stimuli \u2013 what girls learn from a young age about what is \u201csexually relevant\u201d is more influenced by social context than it is for boys.</p> <p>Coupled with the enormous variation within women, this means, again, that attempting to separate differences between male and female sexuality from the bigger picture is fraught, if not futile. If women are more reticent to initiate sexting, suggests Toronto-based sex writer and <a href=\"https://thedildorks.wordpress.com/\">podcast host</a> Kate Sloan, it may be out of internalised shame or fear of judgment, or because of their own experience of being objectified.</p> <p>Conversely, the importance of context for arousal may be a factor in many women\u2019s preference for written erotica over pornography. \u201cYou can write very explicitly what the characters are feeling,\u201d says Sloan. \u201cIt just flies in the face of the shitty cultural stereotype that consent \u2018ruins the moment\u2019, because it\u2019s often a central facet of what makes these stories so sexy.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you\u2019re a woman who\u2019s into men, you actually don\u2019t get to see a lot of the things you\u2019re visually interested in</p> <footer> <cite>Kate Sloan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If men do initiate the exchange of naked images more readily, says Sloan, they have been enabled to do so by a culture that predominantly tailors its imagery to the male gaze. \u201cIf you\u2019re a woman who\u2019s into men, you actually don\u2019t get to see a lot of the things you\u2019re visually interested in \u2013 you get to see a lot of what men think you\u2019re going to be into.\u201d</p> <p>The dominance of that view can have lasting impact on what even straight women understand as attractive. When Sloan was a teenager, taking provocative, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qk9z5p/the-enduring-appeal-of-alt-how-the-suicidegirls-survived-the-2000s\">Suicide Girls</a>-style pictures of herself \u2013 with a digital camera and tripod, as was necessary at the time \u2013 was \u201cdefinitely a way of exploring the burgeoning idea that I might be sexy<strong> </strong>someday\u201d.</p> <p>Our tastes and desires are shaped by society, says Sloan, who is bisexual. She notes that even queer women not seeking to have sex with men may choose to present in such a \u201chyper-feminine\u201d way as theoretically designed to impress them.</p> <p>\u201cIn much the same way that you still have to make money if you disagree with capitalism, you still have to exist within patriarchy,\u201d she says. \u201cIf part of that is that you\u2019re only going to feel good if you have your red lipstick and high heels on, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really anything wrong with that, as long as it is giving you genuine pleasure.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like you have to work with the boundaries you\u2019ve been given, to a certain extent.\u201d</p> <p>Cultural norms are slowly changing, says Drouin, meaning some of our \u201cmore antiquated\u201d ideas about differences between the sexes are being thrown out. \u201cMore women are embracing their sexuality and the culture is more accepting of that, certainly than 75 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>But for many women, sex remains inextricable from risk \u2013 of disease, pregnancy, violence \u2013 which inevitably affects their pursuit and enjoyment of it, regardless of the immediacy of the threat. This also applies to sexting, a \u201cvery, very risky endeavour\u201d for both men and women, says Drouin: \u201cThese images can haunt you later on.\u201d</p> <p>Eva Bloom, a sex educator also in Toronto, says that though the taboo against sending naked images is slowly lifting, women are still being punished for it. Victims of revenge porn can sometimes suffer greater consequences than the person who illegally shared their pictures without consent.</p> <p>But telling women not to sext because of the perceived risk denies them an \u201camazing opportunity for exploration\u201d, says Bloom. Her recent study into sexting by young Canadian women found that those who did sext, even irregularly, were more likely to talk to their partners about safe sex, and what they liked and did not like in bed. Women who sexted frequently were more sexually satisfied, and more likely to report that their last sexual encounter was very pleasurable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/08/what-makes-men-send-dick-pics\">What makes men send dick pics?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though she has not yet established causation, Bloom suggests when there is trust, sexting can be a means of experimentation, and even vetting potential sexual partners. Sloan says that on her podcast The Dildorks, she and co-host Bex Caputo often advise that people float a fantasy with a partner over text first. \u201cIt feels lower pressure than being in bed with somebody and saying: \u2018Hey, can we try this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sloan herself first dipped a toe into many of her own kinks this way. In general, she says, kinky and queer communities are more comfortable to approach sex as a highly individualised experience rather than assuming, \u201cas so many straight, vanilla men do, that because you want to send a dick pic, it will be well-received\u201d.</p> <p>Holden says the best submissions she received for Critique My Dick Pic were those that were obviously concerned with pleasing the recipient, whether that was by displaying some \u201ccreative or artistic or erotic imagination\u201d in the image or simply by clearing any piles of clothes from the background. \u201cYou have to think about \u2018what would this person want to see?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThere are generalisations you can make, there are even some gendered generalisations you can make \u2013 but, ultimately, sex is so individual and personal and touchy, at a certain point, you really do just have to say what you find hot.\u201d</p>",

If women are more reticent to initiate sexting, suggests Toronto-based sex writer and podcast host Kate Sloan, it may be out of internalised shame or fear of judgment, or because of their own experience of being objectified. Conversely, the importance of context for arousal may be a factor in many women\u2019s preference for written erotica over pornography. \u201cYou can write very explicitly what the characters are feeling,\u201d says Sloan. \u201cIt just flies in the face of the shitty cultural stereotype that consent \u2018ruins the moment\u2019, because it\u2019s often a central facet of what makes these stories so sexy.\u201d If men do initiate the exchange of naked images more readily, says Sloan, they have been enabled to do so by a culture that predominantly tailors its imagery to the male gaze. \u201cIf you\u2019re a woman who\u2019s into men, you actually don\u2019t get to see a lot of the things you\u2019re visually interested in \u2013 you get to see a lot of what men think you\u2019re going to be into.\u201d The dominance of that view can have lasting impact on what even straight women understand as attractive. When Sloan was a teenager, taking provocative, Suicide Girls-style pictures of herself \u2013 with a digital camera and tripod, as was necessary at the time \u2013 was \u201cdefinitely a way of exploring the burgeoning idea that I might be sexy someday\u201d. Our tastes and desires are shaped by society, says Sloan, who is bisexual. She notes that even queer women not seeking to have sex with men may choose to present in such a \u201chyper-feminine\u201d way as theoretically designed to impress them. \u201cIn much the same way that you still have to make money if you disagree with capitalism, you still have to exist within patriarchy,\u201d she says. \u201cIf part of that is that you\u2019re only going to feel good if you have your red lipstick and high heels on, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really anything wrong with that, as long as it is giving you genuine pleasure. \u201cI feel like you have to work with the boundaries you\u2019ve been given, to a certain extent.\u201d Cultural norms are slowly changing, says Drouin, meaning some of our \u201cmore antiquated\u201d ideas about differences between the sexes are being thrown out. \u201cMore women are embracing their sexuality and the culture is more accepting of that, certainly than 75 years ago.\u201d But for many women, sex remains inextricable from risk \u2013 of disease, pregnancy, violence \u2013 which inevitably affects their pursuit and enjoyment of it, regardless of the immediacy of the threat. This also applies to sexting, a \u201cvery, very risky endeavour\u201d for both men and women, says Drouin: \u201cThese images can haunt you later on.\u201d Eva Bloom, a sex educator also in Toronto, says that though the taboo against sending naked images is slowly lifting, women are still being punished for it. Victims of revenge porn can sometimes suffer greater consequences than the person who illegally shared their pictures without consent. But telling women not to sext because of the perceived risk denies them an \u201camazing opportunity for exploration\u201d, says Bloom. Her recent study into sexting by young Canadian women found that those who did sext, even irregularly, were more likely to talk to their partners about safe sex, and what they liked and did not like in bed. Women who sexted frequently were more sexually satisfied, and more likely to report that their last sexual encounter was very pleasurable. Though she has not yet established causation, Bloom suggests when there is trust, sexting can be a means of experimentation, and even vetting potential sexual partners. Sloan says that on her podcast The Dildorks, she and co-host Bex Caputo often advise that people float a fantasy with a partner over text first. \u201cIt feels lower pressure than being in bed with somebody and saying: \u2018Hey, can we try this.\u2019\u201d Sloan herself first dipped a toe into many of her own kinks this way. In general, she says, kinky and queer communities are more comfortable to approach sex as a highly individualised experience rather than assuming, \u201cas so many straight, vanilla men do, that because you want to send a dick pic, it will be well-received\u201d. Holden says the best submissions she received for Critique My Dick Pic were those that were obviously concerned with pleasing the recipient, whether that was by displaying some \u201ccreative or artistic or erotic imagination\u201d in the image or simply by clearing any piles of clothes from the background. \u201cYou have to think about \u2018what would this person want to see?\u2019 \u201cThere are generalisations you can make, there are even some gendered generalisations you can make \u2013 but, ultimately, sex is so individual and personal and touchy, at a certain point, you really do just have to say what you find hot.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. One week down in this election campaign and already we have seen factions form and founder, promises of heavy spending and a long list of gaffes and scandals including some that have forced candidates to pull out of the race. Read the following and then follow our live coverage to ensure you don\u2019t miss a thing. What\u2019s going on? It is Equal Pay Day \u2013 when the average woman effectively stops earning for the year, taking into account a mean gender pay gap of 13.1%. The Lib Dems and Labour will use it to announce measures to tackle the gender pay gap. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to oblige bigger companies to publish data on employment levels by gender, as well as for BAME and LGBT staff, and would push for a law to end the so-called pink tax, whereby companies charge higher prices for fundamentally identical products such as razors or deodorants simply because they are marketed at women. Labour has pledged to eradicate the gender pay gap by 2030 through measures such as fines for organisations that fail to report on the subject. This morning the Conservatives have promised to reduce overall migration if they win the general election. \u201cWe will reduce immigration overall while being more open and flexible to the highly skilled people we need, such as scientists and doctors,\u201d said the home secretary, Priti Patel. She claimed immigration would \u201csurge\u201d if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister, a claim Labour said came from the \u201cmake-believe research department\u201d. Boris Johnson has come under fire for his government\u2019s slow response to the flooding across parts of England\u2019s north and has declined to apologise, saying a huge amount of work was going on to help and compensate victims. The PM spent time in deluged regions of Yorkshire, the east Midlands and Lincolnshire on Wednesday. Johnson has hit back at claims he is \u201cin cahoots\u201d with Nigel Farage. In a speech he said that in fact \u201cthe Sturgeon-Corbyn alliance would consign this country to months, if not years, of dither, delay, discord, division\u201d. Corbyn said Labour was \u201cnot doing pacts, not doing deals\u201d if it failed to win a majority in the election, rejecting suggestions fuelled by Sturgeon that he had privately agreed to support a second independence referendum in exchange for Scottish National party support. Instead, he challenged Sturgeon to support a minority Labour government. At a glance Labour is facing pressure over its immigration policy after the Unite union\u2019s Len McCluskey said victory in the election would mean taking a tough line on free movement of workers. Marina Hyde went to a boxing gym with Jo Swinson where the self-described \u201cgirly swot\u201d is trying to channel the energy of Rocky. Boris Johnson dropped a reference to Labour\u2019s \u201conanism\u201d (Google searches spiked after it was reported \u2013 it means masturbation) from a speech after criticism. It is not the first time the prime minister has been criticised for masturbatory insults. Who\u2019s the worst? Rowena Mason offers a guide to the most calamitous candidates. Cities of London and Westminster has been Conservative since 1950 \u2013 but as the area\u2019s \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d balk at hard Brexit, could Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP, now with the Lib Dems, upend it? Proposals by Priti Patel to criminalise unauthorised Gypsy and Traveller encampments fly in the face of police recommendations, it has been revealed. A travellers\u2019 charity obtained figures under FOI showing 75% of police think their current powers are sufficient, 84% do not support criminalising encampments and 65% say lack of sites is the real problem. The day ahead Labour and the Lib Dems will be talking about their equalities policies. The Brexit party is hosting events in Hull this morning and Grimsby tonight. Jeremy Corbyn is still in Scotland, where he is trying to woo back former Labour voters. Best of the rest &gt; Dozens of foreign students, mainland Chinese among them, have been urged to leave Hong Kong after more clashes left several people seriously injured. Several universities have emerged as battlegrounds with protesters trying to prevent police storming the campuses. Student Elina Neverdal Hjoennevaag told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK they were being sent to a hotel: \u201cI don\u2019t really know what is happening. I must pack.\u201d &gt; Almost 30% of people in England are now obese, according to analysis by Diabetes UK. That\u2019s 13 million people \u2013 almost double the number 20 years ago. Caroline Cerny from the Obesity Health Alliance said: \u201cOur food environment has become increasingly flooded with calorific and sugary processed food and we are now paying the price with our health.\u201d The surge in obesity is straining the NHS because more patients need care for related conditions such as cancers, heart attacks, strokes and knee replacements \u2013 as well as type 2 diabetes. &gt; A bioplastic made of organic fish waste that normally goes to landfill has landed its designer the \u00a330,000 James Dyson award. Lucy Hughes, 24, a graduate in product design from the University of Sussex, came up with MarinaTex as a way to tackle environmentally harmful single-use plastics. The material is translucent and strong, and breaks down in home compost or food waste bins within four to six weeks. Today in Focus podcast: Is Scotland moving towards independence? Scotland correspondent Libby Brooks tells Rachel Humphreys how the chaos of Brexit has put independence back at centre stage in this election. Plus: Sayeeda Warsi on the Conservative party\u2019s enduring problem of Islamophobia. Lunchtime read: \u2018Live life colourfully\u2019 In a world laid low by Brexit, you see them at school gates and in supermarket queues: ordinary women with wildly multicoloured hair. Sirin Kale asks five colour converts why they have taken the leap. Sport England manager Gareth Southgate has said he \u201chas to stand up and be accountable\u201d after the canteen clash between Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez, and says his youthful team are ready for Montenegro. Rafael Nadal, the world No 1, admitted he was \u201csuper lucky\u201d after he came back from 5-1 and a match point down to beat Daniil Medvedev at the ATP Finals in London. Shane Sutton, the former head coach of British Cycling and Team Sky, has refused to return to Dr Richard Freeman\u2019s medical tribunal despite efforts to persuade him to change his mind after he stormed out on Tuesday. Saracens will begin their defence of the European Champions Cup at Racing 92 on Sunday without most of their England World Cup players, but Alex Lozowski warned that they were in no mood to surrender a trophy they have won in three of the last four seasons. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has taken up a new role with Fifa as its chief of global football development, the game\u2019s world governing body has announced. Alberto Salazar has issued a part-apology for any \u201ccallous or insensitive\u201d comments about weight that he made to Mary Cain and other female athletes he coached at the Nike Oregon Project. Business The slice of the economic pie taken by shareholders is growing more than six times faster than the serving enjoyed by workers, according to research by the TUC.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission commissioner Sean Hughes made the comments in a speech on Thursday to a conference of credit risk professionals on the Gold Coast. A fortnight ago Frydenberg told the Australian Financial Review the government fully understood bank concerns about \u201cthe need for clarity about the indirect application of responsible lending laws to small business when the family home is used as security\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a real grey area as to what is a small business loan and a personal loan,\u201d he said. Hughes did not name Frydenberg directly during his speech, but he said there were \u201ca number of myths and exaggerated claims about the supposed effects of the responsible lending laws\u201d that were \u201ceither not supported by the facts or data or, if they are real, they are the result of a fundamental misunderstanding and misapplication of the law\u201d. \u201cThe first is the suggestion that small business lending is negatively affected by the responsible lending obligations,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been a lot of misinformation published recently in the media and in the current corporate reporting season about the effect of the responsible lending requirements on small business lending.\u201d He said responsible lending laws did not apply to borrowings made predominantly for a business purpose, even if the loan was secured over the family home. \u201cSo if someone borrows $500,000 of which $300,000 is to be used to establish a small business, and the remainder for making home improvements, the loan is not subject to the responsible lending obligations,\u201d he said. He also said it was a myth that the responsible lending laws hurt economic growth. \u201cIndeed lending trend reports published by the [Australian Banking Association] show that banks are still lending. Approval rates remain between 85% and 90% for home lending and 90% and 95% for business lending,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, the main reason for slower credit growth has been a decline in the demand for credit.\u201d Hughes also dismissed criticism for its appeal against its loss of a lawsuit over responsible lending against Westpac \u2013 which had been accused of 250,000 cases of irresponsible lending \u2013 that has been dubbed the \u201cwagyu and shiraz\u201d case. In September government backbenchers Jason Falinski and James Paterson criticised Asic officials over the decision in a torrid parliamentary committee hearing that followed heavy lobbying of politicians by the banks. Asic decided to appeal the wagyu and shiraz decision \u201cto clarify the application of the law\u201d. \u201cAnd if the judgment is to be understood as standing for the proposition that a lender may do what it wants in the assessment process, as his honour found, then we consider that to be inconsistent with the legislative intention of the responsible lending regime,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWe should not be criticised for accessing the courts to resolve a dispute, as all regulators do from time to time.\u201d \u2022 On 15 November 2019 this article was amended.

      "body": "<p>We are facing the prospect of a few gloomy grey months ahead, with a general election on the horizon, and no end to the Brexit impasse in sight. But one trend has emerged to brighten up these damp winter days.</p> <p>Not long ago you would see rainbow hair only on celebrities such as Katy Perry or Nicki Minaj, or people in the cosplay community. Not any more. What was once a wacky trend is now beloved of ordinary women. Look around your local coffee shop, or observe mothers on the school run, and you may see the rainbow hair trend for yourself. It\u2019s certainly hard to miss.</p> <p>Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce\u2019s rainbow hair streamed behind her as the Jamaican sprinter took gold in the 100m final of the World Championships this year. The Hate U Give actor Amandla Stenberg sported rainbow box braids at the BET awards in July 2018, while members of the K-pop supergroup BTS rock pastel rainbow hair, to the delight of their teenage fans.</p> <p>Although brightly coloured hair is becoming more socially acceptable, not all employers are on board. Kerry Lawrence-Sutton, 32, from Cambridgeshire, recently had the offer of a teaching assistant job rescinded, after the headteacher objected to her hair. \u201cI was gutted,\u201d Lawrence-Sutton tells me. \u201cI\u2019m really good at my job.\u201d</p> <p>So to rainbow or not to rainbow?

I have to sit in meetings with council representatives and statutory agencies for work, where everything is terribly grey, so I think it\u2019s nice to bring a bit of colour into it. I have had negative feedback: a man once asked me in a meeting when I was going to grow up. I just shrugged and said: \u201cYou mean, when am I going to be boring? I hope, never.\u201d He didn\u2019t have a comeback.</p> <p>Apart from my hair, I would describe myself as a not-particularly-adventurous grownup. People can be surprised when they find out I have a serious job \u2013 a customs officer in Gatwick Airport once insisted I had to be an artist because of my hair.</p> <p>I have no idea what colour my natural hair is. I have been dyeing it since I was 20. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say it was brown. I have a fabulous hairdresser, who happens to be my nephew.

I was painfully shy back then. My mum used to plait my hair into one braid, and people would call me Rhino Head. I think when you\u2019re a black woman, society wants you to make other people feel comfortable. You have to wear a black wig or a black weave to fit in. But since having my children, I\u2019m so much more confident. If I want rainbow hair, I\u2019m having rainbow hair.</p> <p>I was browsing Pinterest in August when I came across Amina\u2019s [Mucciolo] pictures. I thought she looked incredible. At first, I got rainbow box braids: my mum did them for me, at her salon. They looked brilliant, but I had to take them out in September, and my mum hasn\u2019t had time to put them back in again \u2013 it takes eight hours, and she\u2019s a very busy lady.</p> <p>I still love the rainbow-hair look, so since then I have been wearing a rainbow wig every day. For me, this wig is like colour therapy. It just cheers me up. When I have rainbow hair, I feel young and bouncy. I feel fun: like the day\u2019s going to be great.</p> <h2>Rainbow hair: how to get started</h2> <p>If you can think of nothing better than having My Little Pony hair, the hairdresser and bright-hair specialist Spooky Ru\u00f1o of the Hunter Collective advises you to enlist the services of a professional, particularly if you have never bleached your hair before. \u201cThere are some people who attempt it on their own,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think their hair is in the best condition.\u201d If your hair is naturally dark, it will be a more difficult look to achieve.</p> <p>In order to dye your hair a rainbow of colours, you first have to lighten it, either by using bleach or a high-lift tint. \u201cYou need to lift you hair to the palest, clean blond,\u201d says Ru\u00f1o. If there is any colour remaining in your hair, the rainbow won\u2019t work. \u201cWhen it comes to blue, it really needs to sit on a clean blond \u2013 otherwise, it will turn green.\u201d Dyeing your hair rainbow colours professionally will be expensive: you will have to bleach your roots every six weeks and top up your colour at the same time, as bright colour fades quickly with washing. For an inexpensive alternative, a rainbow balayage (when the ends of your hair are dyed) is a good bet, as you won\u2019t have to worry about your roots. Or, for an even more low-maintenance alternative, opt for a rainbow wig.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We are facing the prospect of a few gloomy grey months ahead, with a general election on the horizon, and no end to the Brexit impasse in sight. But one trend has emerged to brighten up these damp winter days. Not long ago you would see rainbow hair only on celebrities such as Katy Perry or Nicki Minaj, or people in the cosplay community. Not any more. What was once a wacky trend is now beloved of ordinary women. Look around your local coffee shop, or observe mothers on the school run, and you may see the rainbow hair trend for yourself. It\u2019s certainly hard to miss. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce\u2019s rainbow hair streamed behind her as the Jamaican sprinter took gold in the 100m final of the World Championships this year. The Hate U Give actor Amandla Stenberg sported rainbow box braids at the BET awards in July 2018, while members of the K-pop supergroup BTS rock pastel rainbow hair, to the delight of their teenage fans. Although brightly coloured hair is becoming more socially acceptable, not all employers are on board. Kerry Lawrence-Sutton, 32, from Cambridgeshire, recently had the offer of a teaching assistant job rescinded, after the headteacher objected to her hair. \u201cI was gutted,\u201d Lawrence-Sutton tells me. \u201cI\u2019m really good at my job.\u201d So to rainbow or not to rainbow? We asked five women who have taken the leap. Fiona Sharpe, 53, a communities consultant from Brighton My hair is how people identify me: Fiona with the crazy hair. I have to sit in meetings with council representatives and statutory agencies for work, where everything is terribly grey, so I think it\u2019s nice to bring a bit of colour into it. I have had negative feedback: a man once asked me in a meeting when I was going to grow up. I just shrugged and said: \u201cYou mean, when am I going to be boring? I hope, never.\u201d He didn\u2019t have a comeback. Apart from my hair, I would describe myself as a not-particularly-adventurous grownup. People can be surprised when they find out I have a serious job \u2013 a customs officer in Gatwick Airport once insisted I had to be an artist because of my hair.

      "body": "<p>I took this in Donetsk, Ukraine, in 2014, just as the war with Russia started. It was immediately after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/27/ukraine-donetsk-airport-russia-fighter\">the first battle for Donetsk airport</a>, the first time war came to the city. I was on the bus back to my apartment when I spotted this car and people having a picnic next to it. I got off, and we got talking and had a few drinks. It was a chance meeting, they were all excited to meet a foreigner \u2013 they had never met an English person before.</p> <p>I was taking pictures and they were posing, just young people having fun. This shot was a snapshot, they weren\u2019t really paying attention to me when I took it, but when I looked through my photographs later it stood out. I like the fact you can\u2019t see the girls\u2019 faces. I don\u2019t know them, so I would have felt uncomfortable sharing a picture of them drinking, which might represent them negatively.</p> <p>The image is just of two friends before the war turned bad, but it has become poignant. Back then no one knew what the war would turn into \u2013 no one would have believed how bad it would get and how long it would last. Maybe these girls\u2019 lives went on as normal and they weren\u2019t too badly affected. But it makes me think of many other friends and families I have met and known there who have gone their separate ways because people had to leave the country or because their political differences became so extreme. In that way, it reminds me of what\u2019s happening here in the UK with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>. Families arguing over politics \u2013 the war around the dinner table.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It seemed normal to hear constant artillery and see columns of military vehicles everywhere. Now it seems crazy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I have grandparents from eastern Europe on both sidesand always felt a connection to this part of the world. In 2013, my grandmother was near the end of her life after a long battle with Alzheimer\u2019s, and I started thinking more about Ukraine and making regular trips there.</p> <p>I was in the country when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/21/-sp-ukraine-maidan-protest-kiev\">Euromaidan protests</a> [pro-European/anti-Russian rallies] broke out and the subsequent unrest started to turn violent. I captured some of this action, but I was more interested in quieter stories. Conflict is often presented with the most dramatic imagery, condensed into a story that\u2019s part of a news cycle. But, as you experience it, it\u2019s much more spread out, over long periods in which there\u2019s nothing happening \u2013 and in which life goes on.</p> <p>In 2015, I spent time with a Ukrainian battalion, driving to a frontline town where there had been a battle. I was with soldiers and I kind of knew what we\u2019d see, or what I would be allowed to see. But, on the road on the way there, I was looking out of the window at all these typical things, at old ladies selling pots of honey, thinking: \u201cI\u2019m just passing by all this stuff.\u201d</p> <p>At times it seemed normal to hear constant artillery and see columns of military vehicles everywhere. Now it seems crazy, but you get used to it. I wanted to show how society was affected in so many small ways by the conflict; it wasn\u2019t just on the frontline. Many places aren\u2019t visibly affected, but then there are a lot of displaced people, friends and family on opposite sides of the conflict, and there are towns you have known for years that from one day to the next become impossible to visit. It\u2019s like London and Brighton suddenly being separated by a front line. It\u2019s very complicated and confusing.</p> <p>People have become so used to seeing photographs of conflict from Ukraine that those are the kind of images people associate with the country now. But I find that the pictures people respond to are those that don\u2019t necessarily look like war, the pictures they can engage with. I hope that gets them thinking.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.impressions-gallery.com/\">Borderland: Stories from Donbas by Christopher Nunn is at Impressions Gallery, Centenary Square, Bradford</a>, until 4 January.</p> <h2>Christopher Nunn\u2019s <strong>CV</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c936408fd2460e9012d4290b7f80ea139cd95975\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c936408fd2460e9012d4290b7f80ea139cd95975/230_245_696_870/400.jpg\" alt=\"Self portrait, Christopher Nunn\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Born:</strong> Huddersfield, 1983.</p> <p><strong>Studied:</strong> Photography BA at Bradford College.

      "bodyText": "I took this in Donetsk, Ukraine, in 2014, just as the war with Russia started. It was immediately after the first battle for Donetsk airport, the first time war came to the city. I was on the bus back to my apartment when I spotted this car and people having a picnic next to it. I got off, and we got talking and had a few drinks. It was a chance meeting, they were all excited to meet a foreigner \u2013 they had never met an English person before. I was taking pictures and they were posing, just young people having fun. This shot was a snapshot, they weren\u2019t really paying attention to me when I took it, but when I looked through my photographs later it stood out. I like the fact you can\u2019t see the girls\u2019 faces. I don\u2019t know them, so I would have felt uncomfortable sharing a picture of them drinking, which might represent them negatively. The image is just of two friends before the war turned bad, but it has become poignant. Back then no one knew what the war would turn into \u2013 no one would have believed how bad it would get and how long it would last. Maybe these girls\u2019 lives went on as normal and they weren\u2019t too badly affected. But it makes me think of many other friends and families I have met and known there who have gone their separate ways because people had to leave the country or because their political differences became so extreme. In that way, it reminds me of what\u2019s happening here in the UK with Brexit. Families arguing over politics \u2013 the war around the dinner table. I have grandparents from eastern Europe on both sidesand always felt a connection to this part of the world. In 2013, my grandmother was near the end of her life after a long battle with Alzheimer\u2019s, and I started thinking more about Ukraine and making regular trips there. I was in the country when the Euromaidan protests [pro-European/anti-Russian rallies] broke out and the subsequent unrest started to turn violent. I captured some of this action, but I was more interested in quieter stories. Conflict is often presented with the most dramatic imagery, condensed into a story that\u2019s part of a news cycle. But, as you experience it, it\u2019s much more spread out, over long periods in which there\u2019s nothing happening \u2013 and in which life goes on. In 2015, I spent time with a Ukrainian battalion, driving to a frontline town where there had been a battle. I was with soldiers and I kind of knew what we\u2019d see, or what I would be allowed to see. But, on the road on the way there, I was looking out of the window at all these typical things, at old ladies selling pots of honey, thinking: \u201cI\u2019m just passing by all this stuff.\u201d At times it seemed normal to hear constant artillery and see columns of military vehicles everywhere. Now it seems crazy, but you get used to it. I wanted to show how society was affected in so many small ways by the conflict; it wasn\u2019t just on the frontline. Many places aren\u2019t visibly affected, but then there are a lot of displaced people, friends and family on opposite sides of the conflict, and there are towns you have known for years that from one day to the next become impossible to visit. It\u2019s like London and Brighton suddenly being separated by a front line. It\u2019s very complicated and confusing. People have become so used to seeing photographs of conflict from Ukraine that those are the kind of images people associate with the country now. But I find that the pictures people respond to are those that don\u2019t necessarily look like war, the pictures they can engage with. I hope that gets them thinking. \u2022 Borderland: Stories from Donbas by Christopher Nunn is at Impressions Gallery, Centenary Square, Bradford, until 4 January. Christopher Nunn\u2019s CV Born: Huddersfield, 1983. Studied: Photography BA at Bradford College. Worked various jobs for years before pursuing photography more seriously. Influences: \u201cI like the rawness of photographers such as Gordon Parks, Chris Killip, and Boris Mikhailov, how human their work is. But most of my inspiration comes from the people I meet, the stories they share, and events that happen.\u201d High point: \u201cThe current exhibition at Impressions Gallery. They really helped me define this work and translate it into a powerful exhibition. Meeting so many incredible people in Ukraine over the years and being able to experience a little bit of their lives has been a high point.\u201d Low point: \u201cLearning to photograph again after eye injuries.\u201d Top tip: \u201cTry to get to know who you are.

While the flats are envisioned for upper parts of Building C, the ground floor housing the Bristol Bike Project is also to be revamped, for commercial use. In early 2018, the bike project was among tenants given notice.</p> <p>Since then, says a Connolly and Callaghan spokesman, the owners have continued to house the bike project: \u201cC&amp;C admires the work of the Bristol Bike Project \u2013 and has provided them with space at very low rent for some 10 years. Indeed, C&amp;C has supported them for some 18 months longer than expected\u201d and recently agreed to hold off work on the space until 31 January.</p> <p>While the apartment scheme has so far failed to win planning approval (in July it was again rejected by Bristol city council), other renovations are going ahead. That January date looks like the last reprieve for the bike project at Hamilton House.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time to have that constant threat over you in your head,\u201d says Williams. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to put a lot of staff and volunteer energy into preparing for it. I think us staying in this area is going to be nigh-on impossible.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"493ba295fba1dbac767db1d1ed9f96dc1e535f99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/493ba295fba1dbac767db1d1ed9f96dc1e535f99/0_259_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural on a building next to the Bristol Bike Project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural on a building next to the Bristol Bike Project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Turner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A mural near the project</p></li> </ul> <p>However, the team remain determined to find ways to grow and continue to serve the community. \u201cIt\u2019s a bike project but it\u2019s really a people project,\u201d says Williams. \u201cWith people\u2019s support we will find somewhere. We will be paying a lot more than we do here but maybe we can reach out to new communities as well. If we can do that without losing the people we are already working with then great.\u201d</p> <p>Member and workshop volunteer Debbie says the project runs on the willpower of its volunteers and workers. \u201cPeople care about it. When you\u2019ve got the power of people you can surmount a lot more problems than if you are just being paid to do a job.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated on 29 November 2019 to include comments from Connolly &amp; Callaghan. In addition, a reference to the social enterprise Coexist being \u201cevicted from Hamilton House along with hundreds of tenants\u201d, has been removed. To clarify: in the case of Coexist \u2013 which managed Hamilton House on behalf of C&amp;C \u2013 its lease expired in August 2017 and lengthy renewal negotiations failed.</p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardiancities/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> to join the discussion, catch up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\">our best stories</a> or sign up for our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/03/sign-up-for-the-cityscape-the-best-of-guardian-cities-every-week\">weekly newsletter</a></em></p>",

Recovering alcoholic Mark describes it as a \u201clifetime guarantee\u201d. \u201cThis is the only transport that I have,\u201d says Mohammed, an Algerian asylum seeker. \u201cI need it to go to college and improve my English. I can\u2019t get anywhere without it.\u201d Co-founder Lucas says he often hears people who are struggling with drug addiction say that riding a bike helps them avoid temptation: \u201cThey are able to cycle past the places where they would normally stop and get sucked into a world that they don\u2019t want to be in any more. Having a bike is your vehicle for getting out of that place.\u201d Parents say their children use the bikes given to them by the project every day Williams says bikes have become even more crucial to the city\u2019s asylum seekers since the location where they have to sign in was moved from the city centre to a location eight miles away: \u201cWe were noticing people were either struggling to afford the bus \u2013 which takes up most of the allowance [they] receive from the government \u2013 or they were walking the 16 miles. Others were missing appointments \u2026 [which] jeopardises their asylum claim. A bicycle is a quick, amazing easy solution.\u201d Esam is a Kurdish asylum seeker from Iraq who has been living in Bristol since 2007 while he awaits a decision on whether he can remain. \u201cBristol Bike Project has become like a village for me,\u201d he says, \u201ca society. I\u2019ve been adopted.\u201d Abdul says his three daughters have all received bikes that they ride for eight miles a day to school and back, and to visit family and friends. \u201cWe don\u2019t look at these bikes as used bikes,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s crossed the girls\u2019 minds. The bike does its job and we appreciate it.\u201d Both Lee (left), and Soad Ali, a refugee originally from Kuwait, have expressed their gratitude to the project But the Bristol Bike Project fears its work is under threat and says it has been operating with just a month\u2019s notice to vacate for two years. Hamilton House owner Connolly &amp; Callaghan has been seeking planning permission since 2017 to put apartments into some of the space used by arts and community ventures in the three-building complex. The owners say their apartment proposal was conceived \u201cto save the community uses of Hamilton House\u201d after years of precarious finances. While the flats are envisioned for upper parts of Building C, the ground floor housing the Bristol Bike Project is also to be revamped, for commercial use. In early 2018, the bike project was among tenants given notice. Since then, says a Connolly and Callaghan spokesman, the owners have continued to house the bike project: \u201cC&amp;C admires the work of the Bristol Bike Project \u2013 and has provided them with space at very low rent for some 10 years. Indeed, C&amp;C has supported them for some 18 months longer than expected\u201d and recently agreed to hold off work on the space until 31 January. While the apartment scheme has so far failed to win planning approval (in July it was again rejected by Bristol city council), other renovations are going ahead. That January date looks like the last reprieve for the bike project at Hamilton House. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time to have that constant threat over you in your head,\u201d says Williams. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to put a lot of staff and volunteer energy into preparing for it. I think us staying in this area is going to be nigh-on impossible.\u201d A mural near the project However, the team remain determined to find ways to grow and continue to serve the community. \u201cIt\u2019s a bike project but it\u2019s really a people project,\u201d says Williams. \u201cWith people\u2019s support we will find somewhere. We will be paying a lot more than we do here but maybe we can reach out to new communities as well. If we can do that without losing the people we are already working with then great.\u201d Member and workshop volunteer Debbie says the project runs on the willpower of its volunteers and workers. \u201cPeople care about it. When you\u2019ve got the power of people you can surmount a lot more problems than if you are just being paid to do a job.\u201d \u2022 This article was updated on 29 November 2019 to include comments from Connolly &amp; Callaghan. In addition, a reference to the social enterprise Coexist being \u201cevicted from Hamilton House along with hundreds of tenants\u201d, has been removed. To clarify: in the case of Coexist \u2013 which managed Hamilton House on behalf of C&amp;C \u2013 its lease expired in August 2017 and lengthy renewal negotiations failed.

Sioux Falls is a pleasant city of 180,000 people, situated where the Big Sioux River tumbles off a red granite cliff. It has some decent bars downtown, and a charming array of sculptures dotting the streets, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be much to attract a Chinese multi-billionaire. It\u2019s a town that even few Americans have been to.</p> <p>The money of the world\u2019s mega-wealthy, though, is heading there in ever-larger volumes. In the past decade, hundreds of billions of dollars have poured out of traditional offshore jurisdictions such as Switzerland and Jersey, and into a small number of American states: Delaware, Nevada, Wyoming \u2013 and, above all, South Dakota. \u201cTo some, South Dakota is a \u2018fly-over\u2019 state,\u201d the chief justice of the state\u2019s supreme court said in a speech to the legislature in January. \u201cWhile many people may find a way to \u2018fly over\u2019 South Dakota, somehow their dollars find a way to land here.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/dec/09/the-great-american-tax-haven-why-the-super-rich-love-south-dakota\">The great American tax haven: why the super-rich love South Dakota \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Super-rich people choose between jurisdictions in the same way that middle-class people choose between ISAs: they want the best security, the best income and the lowest costs. That is why so many super-rich people are choosing South Dakota, which has created the most potent force-field money can buy \u2013 a South Dakotan trust. If an ordinary person puts money in the bank, the government taxes what little interest it earns. Even if that money is protected from taxes by an ISA, you can still lose it through divorce or legal proceedings. A South Dakotan trust changes all that: it protects assets from claims from ex-spouses, disgruntled business partners, creditors, litigious clients and pretty much anyone else. It won\u2019t protect you from criminal prosecution, but it does prevent information on your assets from leaking out in a way that might spark interest from the police. And it shields your wealth from the government, since South Dakota has no income tax, no inheritance tax and no capital gains tax.</p> <p>A decade ago, South Dakotan trust companies held $57.3bn in assets. By the end of 2020, that total will have risen to $355.2bn. Those hundreds of billions of dollars are being regulated by a state with a population smaller than Norfolk, a part-time legislature heavily lobbied by trust lawyers, and an administration committed to welcoming as much of the world\u2019s money as it can. US politicians like to boast that their country is the best place in the world to get rich, but South Dakota has become something else: the best place in the world to <em>stay</em> rich.</p> <p>At the heart of South Dakota\u2019s business success is a crucial but overlooked fact: globalisation is incomplete. In our modern financial system, money travels where its owners like, but laws are still made at a local level. So money inevitably flows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/12/nevis-how-the-worlds-most-secretive-offshore-haven-refuses-to-clean-up\" title=\"\">to the places</a> where governments offer the lowest taxes and the highest security. Anyone who can afford the legal fees to profit from this mismatch is able to keep wealth that the rest of us would lose, which helps to explain why \u2013 all over the world \u2013 the rich have become so much richer and the rest of us have not.</p> <p>In recent years, countries outside the US have been cracking down on offshore wealth. But according to an official in a traditional tax haven, who has watched as wealth has fled that country\u2019s coffers for the US, the protections offered by states such as South Dakota are undermining global attempts to control tax dodging, kleptocracy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/05/how-britain-can-help-you-get-away-with-stealing-millions-a-five-step-guide\" title=\"\">money-laundering</a>. \u201cOne of the core issues in fighting a guerrilla war is that if the guerrillas have a safe harbour, you can\u2019t win,\u201d the official told me. \u201cWell, the US is giving financial criminals a safe harbour, and a really effective safe harbour \u2013 far more effective than anything they ever had in Jersey or the Bahamas or wherever.\u201d</p> <p>Those of us who cannot vote in South Dakota elections have little hope of changing its laws. But if we don\u2019t do something to correct the imbalance between global wealth and local legislation, we risk entrenching today\u2019s inequality and creating a new breed of global aristocrat, unaccountable to anyone and getting richer all the time \u2013 with grave consequences for the long-term health of liberal democracy.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>South Dakota is west of Minnesota, east of Wyoming, and has a population of 880,000 people. Politically, its voters enthusiastically embrace the Republicans\u2019 message of self-reliance, low taxes and family values. Donald Trump won more than 60% of the vote there in 2016, and the GOP has held a super-majority in the state\u2019s House of Representatives since the 70s, allowing the party to mould South Dakota in its image for two generations.</p> <p>Outsiders tend to know South Dakota for two things: Mount Rushmore, which is carved with the faces of four US presidents; and Laura Ingalls Wilder, who moved to the state as a girl and wrote the Little House on the Prairie series of children\u2019s books. But its biggest impact on the world comes from a lesser-known fact: it was ground zero for the earthquake of financial deregulation that has rocked the world\u2019s economy.</p> <p>The story does not begin with trusts, but with credit cards, and with Governor William \u201cWild Bill\u201d Janklow, a US marine and son of a Nuremberg prosecutor, who became governor in 1979 and led South Dakota for a total of 16 years. He died almost eight years ago, leaving behind an apparently bottomless store of anecdotes: about how he once brought a rifle to the scene of a hostage crisis; how his car got blown off the road when he was rushing to the scene of a tornado.</p> <p>In the late 70s, South Dakota\u2019s economy was mired in deep depression, and Janklow was prepared to do almost anything to bring in a bit of business. He sensed an opportunity in undercutting the regulations imposed by other states. At the time, national interest rates were set unusually high by the Federal Reserve, meaning that credit card companies were having to pay more to borrow funds than they could earn by lending them out, and were therefore losing money every time someone bought something. Citibank had invested heavily in credit cards, and was therefore at significant risk of going bankrupt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d0df06e402548ee7eab90a5a1f63b60391cc9f98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0df06e402548ee7eab90a5a1f63b60391cc9f98/94_214_2882_1729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"William \u2018Wild Bill\u2019 Janklow, the former governor of South Dakota in 1988.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William \u2018Wild Bill\u2019 Janklow, the former governor of South Dakota in 1988.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Per Breiehagen/Life Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The bank was searching for a way to escape this bind, and found it in Janklow. \u201cWe were in the poorhouse when Citibank called us,\u201d the governor recalled in a later interview. \u201cThey were in bigger problems than we were. We could make it last. They couldn\u2019t make it last. I was slowly bleeding to death; they were gushing to death.\u201d</p> <p>At the bank\u2019s suggestion, in 1981, the governor abolished laws that at the time \u2013 in South Dakota, as in every other state in the union \u2013 set an upper limit to the interest rates lenders could charge. These \u201canti-usury\u201d rules were a legacy of the New Deal era. They protected consumers from loan sharks, but they also prevented Citibank making a profit from credit cards. So, when Citibank promised Janklow 400 jobs if he abolished them, he had the necessary law passed in a single day. \u201cThe economy was, at that time, dead,\u201d Janklow remembered. \u201cI was desperately looking for an opportunity for jobs for South Dakotans.\u201d</p> <p>When Citibank based its credit card business in Sioux Falls, it could charge borrowers any interest rate it liked, and credit cards could become profitable. Thanks to Janklow, Citibank and other major companies came to South Dakota to dodge the restrictions imposed by the other 49 states. And so followed the explosion in consumer finance that has transformed the US and the world. Thanks to Janklow, South Dakota has a financial services industry, and the US has a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickclements/2018/08/16/americans-paid-104-billion-in-credit-card-interest/#771d57fd611a\" title=\"\">trillion-dollar credit card debt</a>.</p> <p>Fresh from having freed wealthy corporations from onerous regulations, Janklow looked around for a way to free wealthy individuals too, and thus came to the decision that would eventually turn South Dakota into a Switzerland for the 21st century. He decided to deregulate trusts.</p> <p>Trusts are ancient and complex financial instruments that are used to own assets, such as real estate or company stock. Unlike a person, a trust is immortal, which was an attractive prospect for English aristocrats of the Middle Ages who wished to make sure their property remained in their families for ever, and would be secure from any confiscation by the crown. This caused a problem, however. More and more property risked being locked up in trusts, subject to the wishes of long-dead people, which no one could alter. So, in the 17th century, judges fought back by creating the \u201crule against perpetuities\u201d, which limited the duration of trusts to around a century, and prevented aristocratic families turning their local areas into mini-kingdoms.</p> <p>That weakened aristocratic families, opened up the British economy, allowed new businessmen to elbow aside the entrenched powers in a way that did not happen elsewhere in Europe, and helped give the world the industrial revolution. \u201cIt\u2019s a paradoxical point, but it wasn\u2019t a bad thing when the scion of some family from out in the counties came down to London and pissed away his fortune. It was redistribution of wealth,\u201d said Eric Kades, a law professor at William &amp; Mary Law School in Virginia, who has studied trusts.</p> <p>English emigrants took the rule to North America with them, and the dynamic recycling of wealth became even more frenetic in the land of the free. Then Governor Janklow came along. In 1983, he abolished the rule against perpetuities and, from that moment on, property placed in trust in South Dakota would stay there for ever. A rule created by English judges after centuries of consideration was erased by a law of just 19 words. Aristocracy was back in the game.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In allowing trusts to last for ever, South Dakota did something genuinely revolutionary, but sadly almost everyone I contacted \u2013 from current governor Kristi Noem to state representatives to members of the South Dakotan Trust Association \u2013 refused to talk about it. For an answer to the question of what exactly prompted the state to ditch the rule against perpetuities, I was eventually directed to Bret Afdahl, the director of the state administration\u2019s Division of Banking, who wanted the question in writing. A week later, back came a one-word response: \u201cunknown\u201d.</p> <p>Initially, South Dakota\u2019s so-called \u201cdynasty trusts\u201d were advertised for their ability to dodge inheritance tax, thus allowing wealthy people to cement their family\u2019s long-term control over property in the way English aristocrats had always wanted to. It also gave plenty of employment to lawyers and accountants.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a clean industry, there are no smokestacks, we don\u2019t have to mine anything out of the earth or anything, and they\u2019re generally good paying jobs,\u201d said Tom Simmons, an expert on trust law at the University of South Dakota, when we chatted over coffee in central Sioux Falls. Alongside his academic work, Simmons is a member of South Dakota\u2019s trust taskforce, which exists to maintain the competitiveness of the state\u2019s trust industry. \u201cJanklow was truly a genius in seeing this would be economic development with a very low cost to the government,\u201d he said. (By \u201cthe government\u201d, he of course means that of South Dakota, not that of the nation, other states or indeed other countries, which all lose out on the taxes that South Dakota helps people avoid.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the 1990s progressed, and more money came to Sioux Falls, South Dakota became a victim of its success, however, since other states \u2013 such as Alaska and Delaware \u2013 abolished the rule against perpetuities, too, thus negating South Dakota\u2019s competitive advantage. But, having started the race to the bottom, Janklow was damned if any other state was going to beat him there. So, in 1997, he created the trust taskforce to make sure South Dakota was going as fast as it could. The taskforce\u2019s job was to seek out legal innovations created in other jurisdictions, whether offshore or in the US, and make them work in South Dakota.</p> <p>Thanks to the taskforce, South Dakota now gives its clients tricks to protect their wealth that would have been impossible 30 years ago. In most jurisdictions, trusts have to benefit someone other than the benefactor \u2013 your children, say, or your favourite charity \u2013 but in South Dakota, clients can create a trust for the benefit of themselves (indeed, Sun Hongbin is a beneficiary of his own trust). Once two years have passed, the trust is immune from any creditor claiming a share of the assets it contains, no matter the nature of their claim. A South Dakotan trust is secret, too. Court documents relating to it are kept private for ever, to prevent knowledge of its existence from leaking out. (It also has the useful side effect of making it all but impossible for journalists to find out who is using South Dakotan trusts, or what legal challenges to them have been filed.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bb2698ad0e4b425b3de0126f8da273309e58f293\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb2698ad0e4b425b3de0126f8da273309e58f293/0_61_2509_2656/945.jpg\" alt=\"Leona Helmsley with her dog, Trouble.\" width=\"945\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leona Helmsley with her dog, Trouble.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennifer Graylock/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This barrage of innovations has allowed lawyers to create structures with complex names \u2013 the South Dakota Foreign Grantor Trust, the Self-Settled Asset Protection Trust, etc \u2013 which have done two simple things: they have kept the state ahead of the competition; and they have made South Dakota\u2019s property protections extraordinarily strong. \u201cThe smart people want privacy,\u201d explained Harvey Bezozi, a Florida financial adviser and tax expert who blogs under the name Your Financial Wizard. \u201cSouth Dakota offers the best privacy and asset protection laws in the country, and possibly in the world, for the wealthy to protect their assets. They\u2019ve done a pretty good job in making themselves unique; a real boutique place where the people in the know will eventually gravitate to.\u201d</p> <p>Among those in the know were the lawyers of Leona Helmsley, the legendarily mean hotel heiress, who coined the phrase \u201conly the little people pay taxes\u201d. When Helmsley died in 2007, she left $12m in trust for the care of her dog, a maltese called Trouble. Trouble dined on crab cakes and kobe beef, and the trust provided her with $8,000 a year for grooming and $100,000 for security guards, who protected her against kidnappings, as well as against reprisals from the people that she bit. When a New York court \u2013 not entirely unreasonably \u2013 decided to restrain this expenditure, trustees moved the trust to South Dakota, which had crafted \u201cpurpose trusts\u201d with just such a client in mind. Other states impose limits on how a purpose trust can care for a pet, on the principle that perhaps there are better things to do with millions of dollars than groom a dog, but South Dakota takes no chances. The client is always right.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Despite all its legal innovating, South Dakota struggled for decades to compete with offshore financial centres for big international clients \u2013 Middle Eastern petro-sheikhs perhaps, or billionaires from emerging markets. The reason was simple: sometimes the owners\u2019 claim to their assets was a little questionable, and sometimes their business practices were a little sharp. Why would any of them put their assets in the US, where they might become vulnerable to American law enforcement, when they could instead put them in a tax haven where enforcement was more \u2026 negotiable?</p> <p>That calculation changed in 2010, in the aftermath of the great financial crisis. Many American voters blamed bankers for costing so many people their jobs and homes. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/29/ubs.banking\" title=\"\">a whistleblower exposed</a> how his Swiss employer, the banking giant UBS, had hidden billions of dollars for its wealthy clients, the conclusion was explosive: banks were not just exploiting poor people, they were helping rich people dodge taxes, too.</p> <p>Congress responded with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca), forcing foreign financial institutions to tell the US government about any American-owned assets on their books. Department of Justice investigations were savage: UBS paid a $780m fine, and its rival Credit Suisse paid $2.6bn, while Wegelin, Switzerland\u2019s oldest bank, collapsed altogether under the strain. The amount of US-owned money in the country plunged, with Credit Suisse losing 85% of its American customers.</p> <p>The rest of the world, inspired by this example, created a global agreement called the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). Under CRS, countries agreed to exchange information on the assets of each other\u2019s citizens kept in each other\u2019s banks. The tax-evading appeal of places like Jersey, the Bahamas and Liechtenstein evaporated almost immediately, since you could no longer hide your wealth there.</p> <p>How was a rich person to protect his wealth from the government in this scary new transparent world? Fortunately, there was a loophole. CRS had been created by lots of countries together, and they all committed to telling each other their financial secrets. But the US was not part of CRS, and its own system \u2013 Fatca \u2013 only gathers information from foreign countries; it does not send information back to them. This loophole was unintentional, but vast: keep your money in Switzerland, and the world knows about it; put it in the US and, if you were clever about it, no one need ever find out. The US was on its way to becoming a truly world-class tax haven.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b958ebdede113bdb885a3d5f32c6453dd63132b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b958ebdede113bdb885a3d5f32c6453dd63132b9/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Black Mountain Hills of South Dakota.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Black Mountain Hills of South Dakota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Posnov/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Tax Justice Network (TJN) still ranks Switzerland as the most pernicious tax haven in the world in its <a href=\"https://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/en/introduction/fsi-2018-results\" title=\"\">Financial Secrecy Index</a>, but the US is now in second place and climbing fast, having overtaken the Cayman Islands, Hong Kong and Luxembourg since Fatca was introduced. \u201cWhile the United States has pioneered powerful ways to defend itself against foreign tax havens, it has not seriously addressed its own role in attracting illicit financial flows and supporting tax evasion,\u201d said the TJN in the report accompanying the 2018 index. In just three years, the amount of money held via secretive structures in the US had increased by 14%, the TJN said. That is the money pouring into Sioux Falls, and into the South Dakota Trust Company.</p> <p>\u201cThe easy takeaway is that people are trying to hide. But wanting to be private, to be confidential, there\u2019s nothing illegal about that,\u201d said Matthew Tobin, the managing director of the South Dakota Trust Company (SDTC), where Sun Hongbin parked his $4.5bn fortune. We were sitting in SDTC\u2019s conference room, which was decorated with a large map of Switzerland, as if it were a hunting trophy.</p> <p>Tobin added that many foreign clients had wealth in another jurisdiction, and worried that information about it could be reported to their home country, thanks to CRS. \u201cThat could put them at risk. They could be at risk of losing their wealth, it could be taken from them. There\u2019s kidnapping, ransom, hostages. There is risk in a lot of parts of the world,\u201d he explained. \u201cPeople are saying: \u2018OK, if the laws are the same, but I can have the stability of the US economy, the US government, and maintain my privacy, I might as well go to the US.\u2019\u201d According to the figures on its website, SDTC now manages trusts holding $65bn and acts as an agent for trusts containing a further $82bn, all of them tax-free, all of them therefore growing more quickly than assets held elsewhere.</p> <p>When I spoke to the official from one of the traditional tax havens, who asked not to be identified, for fear of wrecking what was left of the jurisdiction\u2019s financial services industry, he was furious about what the US was doing. \u201cOne of the bitter aspects of this, and it\u2019s something we haven\u2019t said in public, is the sheer racism of the global anti-money laundering management effort,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will notice that the states that are benefiting from this in America are the whitest states in the country. They\u2019ve ended up beating the shit out of a load of black and Hispanic places, and stuffing all the money in South Dakota. How does that help?\u201d</p> <p>I put those comments to a South Dakotan trust lawyer who agreed to speak to me as long as I didn\u2019t identify them. The lawyer was sympathetic to the offshore official\u2019s argument, but said this is how the world is now, and everyone is just going to have to get used to it. It is, after all, not just South Dakota and its trust companies that are sucking in the world\u2019s money. Banks in Florida and Texas are welcoming cash from Venezuela and Mexico, realtors in Los Angeles are selling property to Chinese potentates, and New York lawyers are arranging these transactions for anyone that wants them to. Perhaps under previous administrations, there might have been some appetite for aligning the US with global norms, but under Trump, it\u2019s never going to happen.</p> <p>\u201cYou can look at South Dakota and its trust industry, but if you really want to look at CRS, look at the amount of foreign money that is flowing into US banks, not just into trusts,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cThe US has decided at very high levels that it is benefiting significantly from not being a member of CRS. That issue is much larger than trusts, and I don\u2019t see that changing, I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>We have no idea yet what this means in the long term, because the revolution in trust law that began in South Dakota and spread throughout the US is only a generation old. But the implications are ominous.</p> <p>Here is an example from one academic paper on South Dakotan trusts: after 200 years, $1m placed in trust and growing tax-free at an annual rate of 6% will have become $136bn. After 300 years, it will have grown to $50.4tn. That is more than twice the current size of the US economy, and this trust will last for ever, assuming that society doesn\u2019t collapse altogether under the weight of this ever-swelling leach.</p> <p>If the richest members of society are able to pass on their wealth tax-free to their heirs, in perpetuity, then they will keep getting richer than those of us who can\u2019t. In fact, the tax rate for everyone else will probably have to rise, to make up for the shortfall caused by the wealthiest members of societies opting out, which will just make the problem worse. Eric Kades, the law professor at William &amp; Mary Law School, thinks that South Dakota\u2019s decision to abolish the rule against perpetuities for the short term benefit of its economy will prove to have been a long-term catastrophe. \u201cIn 50 or 100 years, it will turn out to have been an absolute disaster,\u201d said Kades. \u201cNow we\u2019re going to have a bunch of wealthy families, and no one will be able to piss away that wealth, it will stay in the family for ever. This just locks in advantage.\u201d</p> <p>So far, most of the discussion of this development in wealth management has been confined to specialist publications, where academic authors have found themselves making arguments you do not usually find in discussions of legal constructs as abstruse as trusts. South Dakota, they argue, has struck at the very foundation of liberal democracy. \u201cIt does seem unfair for some people to have access to \u2018property plus\u2019, usable wealth with extra protection built in beyond that which regular property owners have,\u201d noted the Harvard Law Review back in 2003, in an understated summation of the academic consensus that South Dakota has unleashed something disastrous.</p> <p>And if some people have access to privileged property, where does that leave the equality before the law that is central to how society is supposed to function? Another academic, writing in the trade publication Tax Notes two decades ago, put that unfairness in context: \u201cPerpetual trusts can (and will) facilitate enormous wealth and power for dynastic families. In the process, we leave to future generations some serious issues about the nature of our country\u2019s democracy.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>With Washington unconcerned by what is happening, and the rest of the world incapable of doing anything about it, is there any prospect of anyone in South Dakota moving to repair the damage? The short answer is that it is too late. Two-dozen other states now have perpetual trusts too, so the money would just move elsewhere if South Dakota tried to tighten its rules. The longer answer is that South Dakotan politics appears to have been so comprehensively captured by the trust industry that there is no prospect of anything happening anyway.</p> <p>The state legislature is elected every even-numbered year, and meets for two months each spring. It last updated the law governing trusts in 2018, and brought in Terry Prendergast, a trust lawyer, to explain the significance of the changes. \u201cPeople should be allowed to do with their property what they desire to do,\u201d Prendergast explained. \u201cOur entire regulatory scheme reflects that positive attitude and attracts people from around the world to look at South Dakota as a shining example of what trust law can become.\u201d</p> <p>There were a few questions from the representatives, but they were quickly shut down by Mike Stevens, a Republican lawyer, and chairman of the state\u2019s judiciary committee. \u201cNo more questions. I didn\u2019t understand perpetuities in law school, and I don\u2019t want to understand it now,\u201d he said, laughing.</p> <p>Susan Wismer, one of just 10 Democrats among the House\u2019s 70 members, attempted to prolong the discussion by raising concerns about how South Dakota was facilitating tax avoidance, driving inequality and damaging democracy. Her view was dismissed as \u201ccompletely jaded and biased\u201d by a trust lawyer sitting for the Republicans. It was a brief exchange, but it went to the heart of how tax havens work. There is no political traction in South Dakota for efforts to change its approach, since the state does so well out of it. The victims of its policies, who are all in places like California, New York, China or Russia, where the tax take is evaporating, have no vote.</p> <p>Wismer is the only person I met in South Dakota who seemed to understand this. \u201cEver since I\u2019ve been in the legislature, the trust taskforce has come to us with an updating bill, every year or every other year, and we just let it pass because none of us know what it is. They\u2019re monster bills. As Democrats, we\u2019re such a small caucus, we\u2019re the ones who ought to be the natural opponents of this, but we don\u2019t have the technical expertise and don\u2019t really even understand what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she confessed, while we ate pancakes and drank coffee in a truck stop outside Sioux Falls. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a clue what the consequences are to just regular people from what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/07/the-real-goldfinger-the-london-banker-who-broke-the-world\">The real Goldfinger: the London banker who broke the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That means legislators are nodding through bills that they do not understand, at the behest of an industry that is sucking in ever-greater volumes of money from all over the world.

Aren\u2019t ordinary South Dakotans concerned about what their state is enabling?</p> <p>\u201cThe voters don\u2019t have a clue what this means. They\u2019ve never seen a feudal society, they don\u2019t have a clue what they\u2019re enabling,\u201d Wismer said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are 100 people in this state who understand the ramifications of what we\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2019 because an earlier version misnamed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act as the Financial Assets Tax Compliance Act.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Late last year, as the Chinese government prepared to enact tough new tax rules, the billionaire Sun Hongbin quietly transferred $4.5bn worth of shares in his Chinese real estate firm to a company on a street corner in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, one of the least populated and least known states in the US. Sioux Falls is a pleasant city of 180,000 people, situated where the Big Sioux River tumbles off a red granite cliff. It has some decent bars downtown, and a charming array of sculptures dotting the streets, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be much to attract a Chinese multi-billionaire. It\u2019s a town that even few Americans have been to. The money of the world\u2019s mega-wealthy, though, is heading there in ever-larger volumes. In the past decade, hundreds of billions of dollars have poured out of traditional offshore jurisdictions such as Switzerland and Jersey, and into a small number of American states: Delaware, Nevada, Wyoming \u2013 and, above all, South Dakota. \u201cTo some, South Dakota is a \u2018fly-over\u2019 state,\u201d the chief justice of the state\u2019s supreme court said in a speech to the legislature in January. \u201cWhile many people may find a way to \u2018fly over\u2019 South Dakota, somehow their dollars find a way to land here.\u201d Super-rich people choose between jurisdictions in the same way that middle-class people choose between ISAs: they want the best security, the best income and the lowest costs. That is why so many super-rich people are choosing South Dakota, which has created the most potent force-field money can buy \u2013 a South Dakotan trust. If an ordinary person puts money in the bank, the government taxes what little interest it earns. Even if that money is protected from taxes by an ISA, you can still lose it through divorce or legal proceedings. A South Dakotan trust changes all that: it protects assets from claims from ex-spouses, disgruntled business partners, creditors, litigious clients and pretty much anyone else. It won\u2019t protect you from criminal prosecution, but it does prevent information on your assets from leaking out in a way that might spark interest from the police. And it shields your wealth from the government, since South Dakota has no income tax, no inheritance tax and no capital gains tax. A decade ago, South Dakotan trust companies held $57.3bn in assets. By the end of 2020, that total will have risen to $355.2bn. Those hundreds of billions of dollars are being regulated by a state with a population smaller than Norfolk, a part-time legislature heavily lobbied by trust lawyers, and an administration committed to welcoming as much of the world\u2019s money as it can. US politicians like to boast that their country is the best place in the world to get rich, but South Dakota has become something else: the best place in the world to stay rich. At the heart of South Dakota\u2019s business success is a crucial but overlooked fact: globalisation is incomplete. In our modern financial system, money travels where its owners like, but laws are still made at a local level. So money inevitably flows to the places where governments offer the lowest taxes and the highest security. Anyone who can afford the legal fees to profit from this mismatch is able to keep wealth that the rest of us would lose, which helps to explain why \u2013 all over the world \u2013 the rich have become so much richer and the rest of us have not. In recent years, countries outside the US have been cracking down on offshore wealth. But according to an official in a traditional tax haven, who has watched as wealth has fled that country\u2019s coffers for the US, the protections offered by states such as South Dakota are undermining global attempts to control tax dodging, kleptocracy and money-laundering. \u201cOne of the core issues in fighting a guerrilla war is that if the guerrillas have a safe harbour, you can\u2019t win,\u201d the official told me. \u201cWell, the US is giving financial criminals a safe harbour, and a really effective safe harbour \u2013 far more effective than anything they ever had in Jersey or the Bahamas or wherever.\u201d Those of us who cannot vote in South Dakota elections have little hope of changing its laws. But if we don\u2019t do something to correct the imbalance between global wealth and local legislation, we risk entrenching today\u2019s inequality and creating a new breed of global aristocrat, unaccountable to anyone and getting richer all the time \u2013 with grave consequences for the long-term health of liberal democracy. * * * South Dakota is west of Minnesota, east of Wyoming, and has a population of 880,000 people. Politically, its voters enthusiastically embrace the Republicans\u2019 message of self-reliance, low taxes and family values. Donald Trump won more than 60% of the vote there in 2016, and the GOP has held a super-majority in the state\u2019s House of Representatives since the 70s, allowing the party to mould South Dakota in its image for two generations. Outsiders tend to know South Dakota for two things: Mount Rushmore, which is carved with the faces of four US presidents; and Laura Ingalls Wilder, who moved to the state as a girl and wrote the Little House on the Prairie series of children\u2019s books. But its biggest impact on the world comes from a lesser-known fact: it was ground zero for the earthquake of financial deregulation that has rocked the world\u2019s economy. The story does not begin with trusts, but with credit cards, and with Governor William \u201cWild Bill\u201d Janklow, a US marine and son of a Nuremberg prosecutor, who became governor in 1979 and led South Dakota for a total of 16 years. He died almost eight years ago, leaving behind an apparently bottomless store of anecdotes: about how he once brought a rifle to the scene of a hostage crisis; how his car got blown off the road when he was rushing to the scene of a tornado. In the late 70s, South Dakota\u2019s economy was mired in deep depression, and Janklow was prepared to do almost anything to bring in a bit of business. He sensed an opportunity in undercutting the regulations imposed by other states. At the time, national interest rates were set unusually high by the Federal Reserve, meaning that credit card companies were having to pay more to borrow funds than they could earn by lending them out, and were therefore losing money every time someone bought something. Citibank had invested heavily in credit cards, and was therefore at significant risk of going bankrupt. The bank was searching for a way to escape this bind, and found it in Janklow. \u201cWe were in the poorhouse when Citibank called us,\u201d the governor recalled in a later interview. \u201cThey were in bigger problems than we were. We could make it last. They couldn\u2019t make it last. I was slowly bleeding to death; they were gushing to death.\u201d At the bank\u2019s suggestion, in 1981, the governor abolished laws that at the time \u2013 in South Dakota, as in every other state in the union \u2013 set an upper limit to the interest rates lenders could charge. These \u201canti-usury\u201d rules were a legacy of the New Deal era. They protected consumers from loan sharks, but they also prevented Citibank making a profit from credit cards. So, when Citibank promised Janklow 400 jobs if he abolished them, he had the necessary law passed in a single day. \u201cThe economy was, at that time, dead,\u201d Janklow remembered. \u201cI was desperately looking for an opportunity for jobs for South Dakotans.\u201d When Citibank based its credit card business in Sioux Falls, it could charge borrowers any interest rate it liked, and credit cards could become profitable. Thanks to Janklow, Citibank and other major companies came to South Dakota to dodge the restrictions imposed by the other 49 states. And so followed the explosion in consumer finance that has transformed the US and the world. Thanks to Janklow, South Dakota has a financial services industry, and the US has a trillion-dollar credit card debt. Fresh from having freed wealthy corporations from onerous regulations, Janklow looked around for a way to free wealthy individuals too, and thus came to the decision that would eventually turn South Dakota into a Switzerland for the 21st century. He decided to deregulate trusts. Trusts are ancient and complex financial instruments that are used to own assets, such as real estate or company stock. Unlike a person, a trust is immortal, which was an attractive prospect for English aristocrats of the Middle Ages who wished to make sure their property remained in their families for ever, and would be secure from any confiscation by the crown. This caused a problem, however. More and more property risked being locked up in trusts, subject to the wishes of long-dead people, which no one could alter. So, in the 17th century, judges fought back by creating the \u201crule against perpetuities\u201d, which limited the duration of trusts to around a century, and prevented aristocratic families turning their local areas into mini-kingdoms. That weakened aristocratic families, opened up the British economy, allowed new businessmen to elbow aside the entrenched powers in a way that did not happen elsewhere in Europe, and helped give the world the industrial revolution. \u201cIt\u2019s a paradoxical point, but it wasn\u2019t a bad thing when the scion of some family from out in the counties came down to London and pissed away his fortune. It was redistribution of wealth,\u201d said Eric Kades, a law professor at William &amp; Mary Law School in Virginia, who has studied trusts. English emigrants took the rule to North America with them, and the dynamic recycling of wealth became even more frenetic in the land of the free. Then Governor Janklow came along. In 1983, he abolished the rule against perpetuities and, from that moment on, property placed in trust in South Dakota would stay there for ever. A rule created by English judges after centuries of consideration was erased by a law of just 19 words. Aristocracy was back in the game. * * * In allowing trusts to last for ever, South Dakota did something genuinely revolutionary, but sadly almost everyone I contacted \u2013 from current governor Kristi Noem to state representatives to members of the South Dakotan Trust Association \u2013 refused to talk about it. For an answer to the question of what exactly prompted the state to ditch the rule against perpetuities, I was eventually directed to Bret Afdahl, the director of the state administration\u2019s Division of Banking, who wanted the question in writing. A week later, back came a one-word response: \u201cunknown\u201d. Initially, South Dakota\u2019s so-called \u201cdynasty trusts\u201d were advertised for their ability to dodge inheritance tax, thus allowing wealthy people to cement their family\u2019s long-term control over property in the way English aristocrats had always wanted to. It also gave plenty of employment to lawyers and accountants. \u201cIt\u2019s a clean industry, there are no smokestacks, we don\u2019t have to mine anything out of the earth or anything, and they\u2019re generally good paying jobs,\u201d said Tom Simmons, an expert on trust law at the University of South Dakota, when we chatted over coffee in central Sioux Falls. Alongside his academic work, Simmons is a member of South Dakota\u2019s trust taskforce, which exists to maintain the competitiveness of the state\u2019s trust industry. \u201cJanklow was truly a genius in seeing this would be economic development with a very low cost to the government,\u201d he said. (By \u201cthe government\u201d, he of course means that of South Dakota, not that of the nation, other states or indeed other countries, which all lose out on the taxes that South Dakota helps people avoid.) As the 1990s progressed, and more money came to Sioux Falls, South Dakota became a victim of its success, however, since other states \u2013 such as Alaska and Delaware \u2013 abolished the rule against perpetuities, too, thus negating South Dakota\u2019s competitive advantage. But, having started the race to the bottom, Janklow was damned if any other state was going to beat him there. So, in 1997, he created the trust taskforce to make sure South Dakota was going as fast as it could. The taskforce\u2019s job was to seek out legal innovations created in other jurisdictions, whether offshore or in the US, and make them work in South Dakota. Thanks to the taskforce, South Dakota now gives its clients tricks to protect their wealth that would have been impossible 30 years ago. In most jurisdictions, trusts have to benefit someone other than the benefactor \u2013 your children, say, or your favourite charity \u2013 but in South Dakota, clients can create a trust for the benefit of themselves (indeed, Sun Hongbin is a beneficiary of his own trust). Once two years have passed, the trust is immune from any creditor claiming a share of the assets it contains, no matter the nature of their claim. A South Dakotan trust is secret, too. Court documents relating to it are kept private for ever, to prevent knowledge of its existence from leaking out. (It also has the useful side effect of making it all but impossible for journalists to find out who is using South Dakotan trusts, or what legal challenges to them have been filed.) This barrage of innovations has allowed lawyers to create structures with complex names \u2013 the South Dakota Foreign Grantor Trust, the Self-Settled Asset Protection Trust, etc \u2013 which have done two simple things: they have kept the state ahead of the competition; and they have made South Dakota\u2019s property protections extraordinarily strong. \u201cThe smart people want privacy,\u201d explained Harvey Bezozi, a Florida financial adviser and tax expert who blogs under the name Your Financial Wizard. \u201cSouth Dakota offers the best privacy and asset protection laws in the country, and possibly in the world, for the wealthy to protect their assets. They\u2019ve done a pretty good job in making themselves unique; a real boutique place where the people in the know will eventually gravitate to.\u201d Among those in the know were the lawyers of Leona Helmsley, the legendarily mean hotel heiress, who coined the phrase \u201conly the little people pay taxes\u201d. When Helmsley died in 2007, she left $12m in trust for the care of her dog, a maltese called Trouble. Trouble dined on crab cakes and kobe beef, and the trust provided her with $8,000 a year for grooming and $100,000 for security guards, who protected her against kidnappings, as well as against reprisals from the people that she bit. When a New York court \u2013 not entirely unreasonably \u2013 decided to restrain this expenditure, trustees moved the trust to South Dakota, which had crafted \u201cpurpose trusts\u201d with just such a client in mind. Other states impose limits on how a purpose trust can care for a pet, on the principle that perhaps there are better things to do with millions of dollars than groom a dog, but South Dakota takes no chances. The client is always right. * * * Despite all its legal innovating, South Dakota struggled for decades to compete with offshore financial centres for big international clients \u2013 Middle Eastern petro-sheikhs perhaps, or billionaires from emerging markets. The reason was simple: sometimes the owners\u2019 claim to their assets was a little questionable, and sometimes their business practices were a little sharp. Why would any of them put their assets in the US, where they might become vulnerable to American law enforcement, when they could instead put them in a tax haven where enforcement was more \u2026 negotiable? That calculation changed in 2010, in the aftermath of the great financial crisis. Many American voters blamed bankers for costing so many people their jobs and homes. When a whistleblower exposed how his Swiss employer, the banking giant UBS, had hidden billions of dollars for its wealthy clients, the conclusion was explosive: banks were not just exploiting poor people, they were helping rich people dodge taxes, too. Congress responded with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca), forcing foreign financial institutions to tell the US government about any American-owned assets on their books. Department of Justice investigations were savage: UBS paid a $780m fine, and its rival Credit Suisse paid $2.6bn, while Wegelin, Switzerland\u2019s oldest bank, collapsed altogether under the strain. The amount of US-owned money in the country plunged, with Credit Suisse losing 85% of its American customers. The rest of the world, inspired by this example, created a global agreement called the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). Under CRS, countries agreed to exchange information on the assets of each other\u2019s citizens kept in each other\u2019s banks. The tax-evading appeal of places like Jersey, the Bahamas and Liechtenstein evaporated almost immediately, since you could no longer hide your wealth there. How was a rich person to protect his wealth from the government in this scary new transparent world? Fortunately, there was a loophole. CRS had been created by lots of countries together, and they all committed to telling each other their financial secrets. But the US was not part of CRS, and its own system \u2013 Fatca \u2013 only gathers information from foreign countries; it does not send information back to them. This loophole was unintentional, but vast: keep your money in Switzerland, and the world knows about it; put it in the US and, if you were clever about it, no one need ever find out. The US was on its way to becoming a truly world-class tax haven. The Tax Justice Network (TJN) still ranks Switzerland as the most pernicious tax haven in the world in its Financial Secrecy Index, but the US is now in second place and climbing fast, having overtaken the Cayman Islands, Hong Kong and Luxembourg since Fatca was introduced. \u201cWhile the United States has pioneered powerful ways to defend itself against foreign tax havens, it has not seriously addressed its own role in attracting illicit financial flows and supporting tax evasion,\u201d said the TJN in the report accompanying the 2018 index. In just three years, the amount of money held via secretive structures in the US had increased by 14%, the TJN said. That is the money pouring into Sioux Falls, and into the South Dakota Trust Company. \u201cThe easy takeaway is that people are trying to hide. But wanting to be private, to be confidential, there\u2019s nothing illegal about that,\u201d said Matthew Tobin, the managing director of the South Dakota Trust Company (SDTC), where Sun Hongbin parked his $4.5bn fortune. We were sitting in SDTC\u2019s conference room, which was decorated with a large map of Switzerland, as if it were a hunting trophy. Tobin added that many foreign clients had wealth in another jurisdiction, and worried that information about it could be reported to their home country, thanks to CRS. \u201cThat could put them at risk. They could be at risk of losing their wealth, it could be taken from them. There\u2019s kidnapping, ransom, hostages. There is risk in a lot of parts of the world,\u201d he explained. \u201cPeople are saying: \u2018OK, if the laws are the same, but I can have the stability of the US economy, the US government, and maintain my privacy, I might as well go to the US.\u2019\u201d According to the figures on its website, SDTC now manages trusts holding $65bn and acts as an agent for trusts containing a further $82bn, all of them tax-free, all of them therefore growing more quickly than assets held elsewhere. When I spoke to the official from one of the traditional tax havens, who asked not to be identified, for fear of wrecking what was left of the jurisdiction\u2019s financial services industry, he was furious about what the US was doing. \u201cOne of the bitter aspects of this, and it\u2019s something we haven\u2019t said in public, is the sheer racism of the global anti-money laundering management effort,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will notice that the states that are benefiting from this in America are the whitest states in the country. They\u2019ve ended up beating the shit out of a load of black and Hispanic places, and stuffing all the money in South Dakota. How does that help?\u201d I put those comments to a South Dakotan trust lawyer who agreed to speak to me as long as I didn\u2019t identify them. The lawyer was sympathetic to the offshore official\u2019s argument, but said this is how the world is now, and everyone is just going to have to get used to it. It is, after all, not just South Dakota and its trust companies that are sucking in the world\u2019s money. Banks in Florida and Texas are welcoming cash from Venezuela and Mexico, realtors in Los Angeles are selling property to Chinese potentates, and New York lawyers are arranging these transactions for anyone that wants them to. Perhaps under previous administrations, there might have been some appetite for aligning the US with global norms, but under Trump, it\u2019s never going to happen. \u201cYou can look at South Dakota and its trust industry, but if you really want to look at CRS, look at the amount of foreign money that is flowing into US banks, not just into trusts,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cThe US has decided at very high levels that it is benefiting significantly from not being a member of CRS. That issue is much larger than trusts, and I don\u2019t see that changing, I really don\u2019t.\u201d * * * We have no idea yet what this means in the long term, because the revolution in trust law that began in South Dakota and spread throughout the US is only a generation old. But the implications are ominous. Here is an example from one academic paper on South Dakotan trusts: after 200 years, $1m placed in trust and growing tax-free at an annual rate of 6% will have become $136bn. After 300 years, it will have grown to $50.4tn. That is more than twice the current size of the US economy, and this trust will last for ever, assuming that society doesn\u2019t collapse altogether under the weight of this ever-swelling leach. If the richest members of society are able to pass on their wealth tax-free to their heirs, in perpetuity, then they will keep getting richer than those of us who can\u2019t. In fact, the tax rate for everyone else will probably have to rise, to make up for the shortfall caused by the wealthiest members of societies opting out, which will just make the problem worse. Eric Kades, the law professor at William &amp; Mary Law School, thinks that South Dakota\u2019s decision to abolish the rule against perpetuities for the short term benefit of its economy will prove to have been a long-term catastrophe. \u201cIn 50 or 100 years, it will turn out to have been an absolute disaster,\u201d said Kades. \u201cNow we\u2019re going to have a bunch of wealthy families, and no one will be able to piss away that wealth, it will stay in the family for ever. This just locks in advantage.\u201d So far, most of the discussion of this development in wealth management has been confined to specialist publications, where academic authors have found themselves making arguments you do not usually find in discussions of legal constructs as abstruse as trusts. South Dakota, they argue, has struck at the very foundation of liberal democracy. \u201cIt does seem unfair for some people to have access to \u2018property plus\u2019, usable wealth with extra protection built in beyond that which regular property owners have,\u201d noted the Harvard Law Review back in 2003, in an understated summation of the academic consensus that South Dakota has unleashed something disastrous. And if some people have access to privileged property, where does that leave the equality before the law that is central to how society is supposed to function? Another academic, writing in the trade publication Tax Notes two decades ago, put that unfairness in context: \u201cPerpetual trusts can (and will) facilitate enormous wealth and power for dynastic families. In the process, we leave to future generations some serious issues about the nature of our country\u2019s democracy.\u201d * * * With Washington unconcerned by what is happening, and the rest of the world incapable of doing anything about it, is there any prospect of anyone in South Dakota moving to repair the damage? The short answer is that it is too late. Two-dozen other states now have perpetual trusts too, so the money would just move elsewhere if South Dakota tried to tighten its rules. The longer answer is that South Dakotan politics appears to have been so comprehensively captured by the trust industry that there is no prospect of anything happening anyway. The state legislature is elected every even-numbered year, and meets for two months each spring. It last updated the law governing trusts in 2018, and brought in Terry Prendergast, a trust lawyer, to explain the significance of the changes. \u201cPeople should be allowed to do with their property what they desire to do,\u201d Prendergast explained. \u201cOur entire regulatory scheme reflects that positive attitude and attracts people from around the world to look at South Dakota as a shining example of what trust law can become.\u201d There were a few questions from the representatives, but they were quickly shut down by Mike Stevens, a Republican lawyer, and chairman of the state\u2019s judiciary committee. \u201cNo more questions. I didn\u2019t understand perpetuities in law school, and I don\u2019t want to understand it now,\u201d he said, laughing. Susan Wismer, one of just 10 Democrats among the House\u2019s 70 members, attempted to prolong the discussion by raising concerns about how South Dakota was facilitating tax avoidance, driving inequality and damaging democracy. Her view was dismissed as \u201ccompletely jaded and biased\u201d by a trust lawyer sitting for the Republicans. It was a brief exchange, but it went to the heart of how tax havens work. There is no political traction in South Dakota for efforts to change its approach, since the state does so well out of it. The victims of its policies, who are all in places like California, New York, China or Russia, where the tax take is evaporating, have no vote. Wismer is the only person I met in South Dakota who seemed to understand this. \u201cEver since I\u2019ve been in the legislature, the trust taskforce has come to us with an updating bill, every year or every other year, and we just let it pass because none of us know what it is. They\u2019re monster bills. As Democrats, we\u2019re such a small caucus, we\u2019re the ones who ought to be the natural opponents of this, but we don\u2019t have the technical expertise and don\u2019t really even understand what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she confessed, while we ate pancakes and drank coffee in a truck stop outside Sioux Falls. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a clue what the consequences are to just regular people from what we\u2019re doing.\u201d That means legislators are nodding through bills that they do not understand, at the behest of an industry that is sucking in ever-greater volumes of money from all over the world. If this was happening on a Caribbean island, or a European micro-principality, it would not be surprising, but this is the US. Aren\u2019t ordinary South Dakotans concerned about what their state is enabling? \u201cThe voters don\u2019t have a clue what this means. They\u2019ve never seen a feudal society, they don\u2019t have a clue what they\u2019re enabling,\u201d Wismer said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are 100 people in this state who understand the ramifications of what we\u2019ve done.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2019 because an earlier version misnamed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act as the Financial Assets Tax Compliance Act. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "body": "<p>In February, a 27-year-old Indian man named Raphael Samuel announced plans for an unusual lawsuit. He was going to sue his parents for begetting him. \u201cIt was not our decision to be born,\u201d he told the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-47154287\">BBC</a>. \u201cHuman existence is totally pointless.\u201d</p> <p>Samuel recently told me over Skype from Mumbai that his is a good life, and he is actually close to his parents. His complaint is more fundamental: he believes it is wrong to bring new people into the world without their consent. He wanted to sue his parents for a symbolic amount of money, such as a single rupee, \u201cto instill that fear among parents in general. Because now parents don\u2019t think before having a child,\u201d he told me. </p> <p>Samuel subscribes to a philosophy called anti-natalism. The basic tenet of anti-natalism is simple but, for most of us, profoundly counterintuitive: that life, even under the best of circumstances, is not a gift or a miracle, but rather a harm and an imposition. According to this logic, the question of whether to have a child is not just a personal choice but an ethical one \u2013 and the correct answer is always no.</p> <p>Since his announcement, the lawsuit has not gotten off the ground. \u201cI have been clearly told by a sitting judge that I will be fined by the court for wasting its time,\u201d Samuel said. Still, his lawsuit gave the anti-natalist movement a boost, even earning a bemused mention by Stephen Colbert. In May, Dana Wells, a 37-year-old Dallas-based woman who goes by \u201cThe Friendly Antinatalist\u201d on YouTube, posted a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUE9N5uTbxA\">video</a> featuring the Colbert clip and congratulating Samuel. \u201cWe all owe you a round of applause,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve arrived. It feels like the big time!\u201d</p> <p>The notion that having children may be a bad idea seems to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/26/falling-total-fertility-rate-should-be-welcomed-population-expert-says\">gaining mainstream popularity</a>. But when we hear about it, it\u2019s most often in the context of the climate crisis: activists are worried about bringing children into a world threatened by rising seas, mass displacement and other calamities. Anti-natalists, however, believe that procreation has always been and always will be wrong because of life\u2019s inevitable suffering. What is similar about both anti-natalists and climate activists is they are seeing an increase in attention due to general pessimism about the state of the world, giving both more opportunities to gain support.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>In 2006, the South African philosopher David Benatar published a book which is widely credited with introducing the term anti-natalism. In Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence, Benatar quotes the Greek tragedian Sophocles (\u201cNever to have been born is best / But if we must see the light, the next best / Is quickly returning whence we came\u201d) and the text of Ecclesiastes (\u201cSo I have praised the dead that are already dead more than the living that are yet alive; but better than both of them is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun\u201d). These quotes suggest that the sentiments at the heart of anti-natalism have been around for a very long time.</p> <p>In modern history, another strain of thought emerged, warning against the dangers of population growth. In the late 18th century, Thomas Malthus sounded the alarm that the population would outstrip the food supply. In 1968, a Stanford biologist named Paul Ehrlich published the bestselling book The Population Bomb and co-founded the organization Zero Population Growth (later renamed <a href=\"https://www.populationconnection.org/\">Population Connection</a>), arguing that the growth in global population would lead to famines and ecological crisis. He also suggested that people have no more than two children.</p> <p>One member of Zero Population Growth struck out on his own with a much more radical agenda. A man named Les Knight launched the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) with the goal of \u201cPhasing out the human race by voluntarily ceasing to breed\u201d, as stated on the <a href=\"http://www.vhemt.org/\">website</a> that he launched in 1996.</p> <p>While Benatar also sought to discourage reproduction, his ideas grew out of different premises. The objective of anti-natalism, as Benatar sees it, is to reduce human suffering. Since life inevitably involves some amount of suffering, bringing another person into the world introduces the guarantee of some harm. He argued that \u201cthe quality of even the best lives is very bad \u2013 and considerably worse than most people recognize it to be. Although it is obviously too late to prevent our own existence, it is not too late to prevent the existence of future possible people.\u201d</p> <p>Benatar told me recently that he has heard from many readers of his book who \u201chave often felt that they were alone in the world. It was a great comfort to them to read a philosophical defense of a view they found intuitively correct.\u201d</p> <p>Dana Wells, the Dallas-based YouTuber, felt validated by Benatar\u2019s work. About five years ago, she reunited with her biological brother (she was adopted), and he grilled her about why she didn\u2019t have children. Feeling annoyed after their meeting, she searched online for books \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m a reader. I\u2019m a nerd,\u201d she says \u2013 in hopes of finding out about others who didn\u2019t want kids.</p> <p>For the first time, she encountered the terms \u201cchildfree\u201d and \u201canti-natalism\u201d. She began \u201cto see that this life game is an imposition\u201d. For her, it was simple: \u201cLiving things can be harmed. Non-living things cannot be harmed.\u201d</p> <p>As \u201cThe Friendly Antinatalist\u201d, she posts videos with titles like First American Use of the Term \u2018Antinatalism\u2019 and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMfDoLDkh1Y\">Can Parents Be Antinatalists</a>? The answer to that question is yes, Wells says, looking into the camera. \u201cIt would be great if all anti-natalists could be childfree, but the world just doesn\u2019t work out that way, you know? Especially for people who have recently learned about anti-natalism \u2026 you can\u2019t fault those people for having children in the 70s, 80s, or 90s.\u201d</p> <p>She also discusses the distinctions between true anti-natalists (those who believe that creating new life is always wrong); the childfree (who don\u2019t want kids themselves but don\u2019t necessarily consider procreation unethical); and \u201cdenatalists\u201d (who disapprove of procreation only under certain conditions such as people with genetic disabilities they will pass on to offspring, though this disapproval doesn\u2019t usually transfer to racial or ethnic groups). Real anti-natalism, Wells emphasizes, means opposing all births, under all circumstances.</p> <p>Wells also uses her videos to address tensions among true anti-natalists. \u201cThe biggest rift is between the vegans and the non-vegans,\u201d she told me. To Benatar and his followers, the values of anti-natalism \u2013 that is, the imperative to avoid harm \u2013 apply not only to humans but to all sentient beings.</p> <p>This brings us to perhaps the most unexpected aspect of anti-natalism: taken to its logical conclusion, it implies that not only humans but all sentient beings should be spared from life. As Benatar writes toward the end of the book, \u201cit would be better if humans (and other species) became extinct.\u201d As a result, many, but not all, anti-natalists are vegans. (The Antinatalism page on Facebook has about 7,000 followers; the Antinatalist Vegans page has more than 13,000.)</p> <p>The challenge for anti-natalists \u2013 especially those who believe that not only humans but other species would be better off nonexistent \u2013 is how to achieve their goals without imposing additional suffering.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>While anti-natalists believe that life is a curse, climate activists are primarily concerned about inflicting the ecological state of the world of today \u2013 and especially of tomorrow \u2013 on a child.</p> <p>In 2015, two American climate activists, Meghan Kallman and Josephine Ferorelli, founded a network called <a href=\"https://conceivablefuture.org/\">Conceivable Future</a>. They organize house parties throughout the country for people to share their considerations about having children, given the realities of the climate crisis. They upload videos from these gatherings to their website and encourage others to post their own \u201ctestimony\u201d.</p> <p>In one video, a 31-year-old elementary school teacher says: \u201cI feel such fear and guilt and shame and sadness already \u2026 I find the loss of animals and plant life, the loss of water and air, just sad.\u201d Others are more concerned about inflicting a child \u2013 or rather the emissions the child would inevitably produce \u2013 on the world.\u201d In another video, a young man asks: \u201cDo I really want to bring someone else into the world who\u2019s gonna consume those fossil fuels?\u201d</p> <p>The Conceivable Future co-founders do not advocate any particular choice about childbearing. Instead, they want to open the space for these painful conversations. \u201cWe had noticed that the climate movement really lacked heart,\u201d Kallman told me. Drawing the connections between the issue and these intensely personal decisions was a way to illuminate the stakes of climate change. \u201cEvery successful social movement in history has been successful because people can see what it means for them,\u201d Kallman said. \u201cWe see our job as giving people the emotional grounding to do the work.\u201d</p> <p>In March, the British singer-songwriter Blythe Pepino <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/12/birthstrikers-meet-the-women-who-refuse-to-have-children-until-climate-change-ends\">began organizing a group</a> called BirthStrike, made up of about 600 people globally who refuse to have children as a result of the climate breakdown.

      "bodyText": "In February, a 27-year-old Indian man named Raphael Samuel announced plans for an unusual lawsuit. He was going to sue his parents for begetting him. \u201cIt was not our decision to be born,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cHuman existence is totally pointless.\u201d Samuel recently told me over Skype from Mumbai that his is a good life, and he is actually close to his parents. His complaint is more fundamental: he believes it is wrong to bring new people into the world without their consent. He wanted to sue his parents for a symbolic amount of money, such as a single rupee, \u201cto instill that fear among parents in general. Because now parents don\u2019t think before having a child,\u201d he told me. Samuel subscribes to a philosophy called anti-natalism. The basic tenet of anti-natalism is simple but, for most of us, profoundly counterintuitive: that life, even under the best of circumstances, is not a gift or a miracle, but rather a harm and an imposition. According to this logic, the question of whether to have a child is not just a personal choice but an ethical one \u2013 and the correct answer is always no. Since his announcement, the lawsuit has not gotten off the ground. \u201cI have been clearly told by a sitting judge that I will be fined by the court for wasting its time,\u201d Samuel said. Still, his lawsuit gave the anti-natalist movement a boost, even earning a bemused mention by Stephen Colbert. In May, Dana Wells, a 37-year-old Dallas-based woman who goes by \u201cThe Friendly Antinatalist\u201d on YouTube, posted a video featuring the Colbert clip and congratulating Samuel. \u201cWe all owe you a round of applause,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve arrived. It feels like the big time!\u201d The notion that having children may be a bad idea seems to be gaining mainstream popularity. But when we hear about it, it\u2019s most often in the context of the climate crisis: activists are worried about bringing children into a world threatened by rising seas, mass displacement and other calamities. Anti-natalists, however, believe that procreation has always been and always will be wrong because of life\u2019s inevitable suffering. What is similar about both anti-natalists and climate activists is they are seeing an increase in attention due to general pessimism about the state of the world, giving both more opportunities to gain support. \u2022\u2022\u2022 In 2006, the South African philosopher David Benatar published a book which is widely credited with introducing the term anti-natalism. In Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence, Benatar quotes the Greek tragedian Sophocles (\u201cNever to have been born is best / But if we must see the light, the next best / Is quickly returning whence we came\u201d) and the text of Ecclesiastes (\u201cSo I have praised the dead that are already dead more than the living that are yet alive; but better than both of them is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun\u201d). These quotes suggest that the sentiments at the heart of anti-natalism have been around for a very long time. In modern history, another strain of thought emerged, warning against the dangers of population growth. In the late 18th century, Thomas Malthus sounded the alarm that the population would outstrip the food supply. In 1968, a Stanford biologist named Paul Ehrlich published the bestselling book The Population Bomb and co-founded the organization Zero Population Growth (later renamed Population Connection), arguing that the growth in global population would lead to famines and ecological crisis. He also suggested that people have no more than two children. One member of Zero Population Growth struck out on his own with a much more radical agenda. A man named Les Knight launched the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) with the goal of \u201cPhasing out the human race by voluntarily ceasing to breed\u201d, as stated on the website that he launched in 1996. While Benatar also sought to discourage reproduction, his ideas grew out of different premises. The objective of anti-natalism, as Benatar sees it, is to reduce human suffering. Since life inevitably involves some amount of suffering, bringing another person into the world introduces the guarantee of some harm. He argued that \u201cthe quality of even the best lives is very bad \u2013 and considerably worse than most people recognize it to be. Although it is obviously too late to prevent our own existence, it is not too late to prevent the existence of future possible people.\u201d Benatar told me recently that he has heard from many readers of his book who \u201chave often felt that they were alone in the world. It was a great comfort to them to read a philosophical defense of a view they found intuitively correct.\u201d Dana Wells, the Dallas-based YouTuber, felt validated by Benatar\u2019s work. About five years ago, she reunited with her biological brother (she was adopted), and he grilled her about why she didn\u2019t have children. Feeling annoyed after their meeting, she searched online for books \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m a reader. I\u2019m a nerd,\u201d she says \u2013 in hopes of finding out about others who didn\u2019t want kids. For the first time, she encountered the terms \u201cchildfree\u201d and \u201canti-natalism\u201d. She began \u201cto see that this life game is an imposition\u201d. For her, it was simple: \u201cLiving things can be harmed. Non-living things cannot be harmed.\u201d As \u201cThe Friendly Antinatalist\u201d, she posts videos with titles like First American Use of the Term \u2018Antinatalism\u2019 and Can Parents Be Antinatalists? The answer to that question is yes, Wells says, looking into the camera. \u201cIt would be great if all anti-natalists could be childfree, but the world just doesn\u2019t work out that way, you know? Especially for people who have recently learned about anti-natalism \u2026 you can\u2019t fault those people for having children in the 70s, 80s, or 90s.\u201d She also discusses the distinctions between true anti-natalists (those who believe that creating new life is always wrong); the childfree (who don\u2019t want kids themselves but don\u2019t necessarily consider procreation unethical); and \u201cdenatalists\u201d (who disapprove of procreation only under certain conditions such as people with genetic disabilities they will pass on to offspring, though this disapproval doesn\u2019t usually transfer to racial or ethnic groups). Real anti-natalism, Wells emphasizes, means opposing all births, under all circumstances. Wells also uses her videos to address tensions among true anti-natalists. \u201cThe biggest rift is between the vegans and the non-vegans,\u201d she told me. To Benatar and his followers, the values of anti-natalism \u2013 that is, the imperative to avoid harm \u2013 apply not only to humans but to all sentient beings. This brings us to perhaps the most unexpected aspect of anti-natalism: taken to its logical conclusion, it implies that not only humans but all sentient beings should be spared from life. As Benatar writes toward the end of the book, \u201cit would be better if humans (and other species) became extinct.\u201d As a result, many, but not all, anti-natalists are vegans. (The Antinatalism page on Facebook has about 7,000 followers; the Antinatalist Vegans page has more than 13,000.) The challenge for anti-natalists \u2013 especially those who believe that not only humans but other species would be better off nonexistent \u2013 is how to achieve their goals without imposing additional suffering. \u2022\u2022\u2022 While anti-natalists believe that life is a curse, climate activists are primarily concerned about inflicting the ecological state of the world of today \u2013 and especially of tomorrow \u2013 on a child.

      "bodyText": "Stuart Robert has defended the governance of the National Disability Insurance Agency, but refused to sign up to more ambitious targets to get younger people out of aged care in an outing at the National Press Club on Thursday. The minister for the NDIS and government services declared \u201cabsolute confidence\u201d in the agency\u2019s chief executive, Martin Hoffman, despite controversial social media posts, and revealed the global law firm Ashurst had conducted an investigation and found \u201cno clear privacy breaches\u201d in NDIA chair Helen Nugent\u2019s reported use of her Macquarie Bank email for NDIS business. On Tuesday the Australian reported that when Hoffman was a New South Wales and federal public servant he had praised Scott Morrison on Twitter, and retweeted Donald Trump and comments attacking the militant construction union. Hoffman has denied being an \u201canti-union Trump supporter\u201d and deleted his account. Robert said Hoffman had posted the material before he became chief executive and \u201che enjoys the freedom of speech that everyone else here enjoys\u201d. \u201cI absolutely and utterly reject any assertion that he is not a public servant of the highest calibre,\u201d Robert said. \u201cHe enjoys my absolute confidence.\u201d Robert appeared at the press club to launch the latest NDIS quarterly report, but was grilled on topics ranging from the extensive redactions of NDIS data from freedom of information responses to the legality of the robodebt program. The report paints a picture of an improving system, with 114,000 participants added to the scheme and a total of 310,000 now receiving support. Robert told reporters the disability workforce would have to add an extra 90,000 workers to cope with projected increased demand. He foreshadowed future reforms including the national rollout of independent functional assessment, greater flexibility of funded support and greater data-sharing with disability and research groups. Robert said between March 2017 and June 2019 the number of younger people in residential aged care had decreased by 11%, from 6,287 to 5,606. \u201cThe number of younger people entering residential aged care has also decreased by 22%, from 536 new entries in the June quarter of 2017 to 416 in the June quarter of 2019,\u201d he said. The aged care royal commission\u2019s interim report recommended the government commit that no more younger people should enter aged care by 2022 and all younger people in care should be out by 2025, subject to limited exemptions. Robert said \u201cI want to do a lot more\u201d but he was still considering if it was \u201cappropriate and possible to do more\u201d. \u201cIt requires a huge number of houses to be built, providers to be identified and to be able to provide the support so lots of things have to work together \u2026 but we are absolutely committed to looking at it.\u201d In response to a question about the Saturday Paper\u2019s report that for two years Nugent conducted business relating to the $22bn NDIS from an email server belonging to Macquarie Bank, Robert revealed that he had asked for an independent review. The Ashurst review found \u201cno clear breaches of privacy\u201d but recommended that the disability agency demonstrate that no further emails would be sent to personal addresses. Robert said board minutes had been sent to the personal emails of nonexecutive directors \u201csince the inception of the scheme\u201d under Labor in July 2013. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with [the practice] \u2026 [and] to ensure the highest level of probity concerning NDIS emails, the [departmental] secretary will get to me by mid-November to assure me those actions have been undertaken.\u201d Asked about extensive redactions from an ABC freedom of information request about waiting times for NDIS plans, Robert responded by claiming material from his incoming ministerial brief had been excluded by the terms of the reporter\u2019s own request. Robert then produced a printed copy of the quarterly report, claiming it has \u201cevery bit of data you could possibly want\u201d. Robert was asked about former senior administrative appeals tribunal member Terry Carney\u2019s contention that robodebts are unlawful, and two-high profile cases in May and September when Centrelink waived the debt rather then drop the case. At first, Robert refused to answer because the question did not relate to the NDIS, but then defended the legality of robodebt by arguing the system of \u201caveraging as the basis to say to a citizen \u2018there may be a debt, please engage with us\u2019 was entirely appropriate\u201d. \u201cAs Australians engage with us and provide information to us, many times they can actually prove that they haven\u2019t earned too much, and in fact in 19.9% of cases, Australians when they engage with us actually demonstrate through their bank account records or salary payslips that they don\u2019t have a debt.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Court documents show that police raided the home of the former intelligence officer Cameron Jon Gill in September because they suspected he was the source of Annika Smethurst\u2019s story revealing plans to expand spying powers. The special case book in Smethurst\u2019s high court appeal and the attached warrant for the raid on Gill\u2019s home both name Gill as the staff member of the Australian Signals Directorate who police suspect of having communicated classified information to Smethurst. News Corp has said that Smethurst has never revealed the source\u2019s identity, even to her employer. Guardian Australia does not suggest that Gill\u2019s inclusion in the case book \u2013 a statement of facts and questions of law agreed by Smethurst and the Australian federal police \u2013 proves he is the source. But the documents confirm that the raid on Gill\u2019s home was directly linked to the raid on Smethurst\u2019s home in June that unleashed a fierce campaign by media companies for greater press freedom. Gill is also named in both warrants for the Smethurst raids. In August the home affairs department secretary, Michael Pezzullo, said police were \u201cclosing in\u201d on the suspect who he said, subject to proper judicial processes, should \u201cgo to jail\u201d. Smethurst and News Corp are locked in a high court battle to force police to destroy or refrain from using material seized in the June raid. The Australian federal police have undertaken not to use the material, but its lawyers have told the court this undertaking will expire at the conclusion of her case challenging the validity of the warrant, and the information \u201cmay well be important\u201d for a potential future prosecution. The court has heard this includes potential referrals to the commonwealth director of public prosecutions to consider laying charges against Smethurst\u2019s source for a breach of the Intelligence Services Act, and Smethurst for the Sunday Telegraph article that reproduced part of the classified document. Police have never ruled out referring a brief of evidence for possible charges against Smethurst, although the attorney general would have to consent to that. At Wednesday\u2019s hearing Smethurst\u2019s counsel, Stephen Lloyd, said the solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, had hinted that a police referral to the commonwealth director of public prosecutions was \u201cproximate\u201d and had invited the court to infer that the only reason it had not yet occurred was that they had been unable to examine material seized. Lloyd urged the court not to refuse an injunction because of the mere possibility of charges. The warrant for the raid on Gill\u2019s home authorised police to look for emails, encrypted messages, notes and the leaked document titled ASD as a Statutory Agency \u2013 Further Amendments to the Intelligence Services Act 2001 provided they related to Smethurst, the Sunday Telegraph, ASD, the departments of defence and home affairs, or two other persons or entities whose names are redacted. Police were entitled to search for materials provided there were reasonable grounds for suspecting they would afford evidence relating to the following alleged offence: \u201cBetween 1 February 2018 and 29 April 2018, Cameron Jon Gill being a staff member of the [ASD] communicated [ASD] information to Annika Claire Smethurst contrary to section 40 of the Intelligence Services Act 2001.\u201d The special case book notes the raids in June were conducted under two warrants: the first issued on 31 May authorising searches of her premises and a vehicle; the second on 3 June authorising a different AFP officer to search the premises. Referring to the publication of the Sunday Telegraph article, both warrants said: \u201cOn the 29 April 2018, Annika Smethurst and the Sunday Telegraph communicated a document or article to a person, that was not in the interest of the commonwealth, and permitted that person to have access to the document, contrary to section 79(3) of the Crimes Act 1914, Official Secrets. \u201cOn 4 September 2019, members of the AFP purportedly executed a search warrant \u2026at the premises of Mr Cameron Gill, being the person (other than Ms Smethurst) who was named in the second condition of the first warrant and the second warrant,\u201d the case book said. A News Corp spokesman told Guardian Australia it would be \u201cinaccurate to report speculation [that Gill was the source] as fact\u201d. \u201cAnnika has never revealed her source publicly, privately or to her employer, and we\u2019re not going to ask her. \u201cAny further comment would be inappropriate as the matter is before the court.\u201d At the time of the September raid on Gill\u2019s home, News Corp\u2019s head of government affairs, Campbell Reid, said: \u201cWe have always said the AFP raids on journalists were not intended to intimidate journalists but the people who have the courage to talk to journalists. Today we are seeing that process of intimidation continue.\u201d The court adjourned on Wednesday, to return on a date yet to be fixed. On Tuesday the court urged Smethurst\u2019s lawyers to clarify the basis for an order to destroy documents and consider pleading breach of confidence or seeking an order to prevent the use of material copied from her phone rather than its destruction. Lloyd told the court that the issue with pleading breach of confidence was \u201cthe need to disclose the material that we seek to keep private\u201d. Chief justice Susan Kiefel asked Lloyd to confine submissions to the validity of the warrant rather than elaborate on claims the section 79(3) offence breached the implied freedom of political communication.",

That brief moment in time when life felt less rushed, there were fewer tourists, and everything from the food to the culture just felt that little bit more authentic and real. Vanuatu is still that destination. Yapilmai Waterfall, Tanna. Photograph: Joel Johnsson. Sustainable tourism goes to the very heart of this South Pacific nation. From employing and upskilling locals to creating positive change for whole communities, a lot of conscious effort has gone into ensuring the things that people love about this country will still exist in the future.

Vanuatu is the complete package, with accommodation options as diverse as the islands themselves.

Stargazing. Photograph: Matthew Vandeputte. Think a magical Havannah Harbour day cruise, followed by stargazing at dinner; a spa treatment using volcanic ash and hot lava stones; island excursions on which you have a chance to experience some of Vanuatu\u2019s rich cultures first-hand; or a fishing expedition on which you can catch your fish and eat it too. Your visit would also be making a difference. Properties such as Palm House Boutique Resort, Ratua Island Resort &amp; Spa, and The Havannah (one of the National Geographic Unique Lodges of the World) take social responsibility seriously. More than just providing employment, Ratua Island in particular actively works to give back to local communities, helping to improve the standard of living and education for hundreds of local families.

Not only does it open your children\u2019s eyes and minds to the world, but it\u2019s also a perfect excuse to just embrace the moment and have some fun. Many of Vanuatu\u2019s hotels and resorts, such as the five-star Tamanu on the Beach, are becoming increasingly family-friendly. Tamanu has everything from a new kids\u2019 club to nanny services for when you need a night off, while Ratua Island has set up new family-focused glamping tents. You can find a full list of luxe family-friendly options here. Tamanu on the Beach.

Easily accessible on a day trip, it\u2019s a jungle paradise where you can get to know locals and their customs, hear stories passed down through the generations, and top it all off with a snorkel in the stunning fringing coral reefs. Other must-dos include a locally guided bike and hike combo with Vanuatu Ecotours, which takes you off road to explore winding trails, waterfalls and hidden beaches. Blue hole.

      "body": "<p>A jury in Auckland has been shown a second police interview with the man accused of murdering Grace Millane, in which he says the British backpacker had accidentally died while being consensually strangled.</p> <p>The 27-year-old New Zealand man, whose identity is suppressed, has pleaded not guilty to the 21-year-old\u2019s murder.</p> <p>In his second formal interview with police, on 8 December, the accused admitted taking Millane back to his hotel room on the night of 1 December after a Tinder date, and said they engaged in rough sex initiated by Millane, evoking scenes she had seen in a film. He said that the next morning, when he realised she had died, he contorted her body into a suitcase.</p> <p>\u201cIt felt wrong,\u201d the man said in the police interview, saying he cried as he carried out the burial and then tried to take an overdose of Panadol and anti-depressant medication to end his life.</p> <p>Prosecutors allege Millane was murdered by the accused in his hotel room. It is not disputed that Millane died in the CityLife hotel by strangulation, and that the accused buried her body in a suitcase. In an initial police interview, the accused told police he parted ways with Millane at 8pm the night before, and that she had then unmatched him on Tinder.</p> <p>The man said after engaging in consensual sex with Millane, he passed out in the shower and when he went back to bed he thought Millane had gone home because the lights were off and he could not see her. When he woke the next morning he saw her body lying next to the bed.</p> <p>\u201cI yelled out at her, I tried to move her to see if she was awake \u2026 I was in shock, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I picked her up and tried to wake her up \u2026 then I was screaming \u2018Grace, Grace\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI took a whole lot of tablets that I had because I realised that she was not alive and I just wanted to end it all, for me.\u201d</p> <p>The man said he typed in New Zealand\u2019s emergency number, 111, but didn\u2019t make the call. \u201cI was scared how bad it looked \u2026 there\u2019s a dead person in my room, I thought it looked terrible.

      "bodyText": "A jury in Auckland has been shown a second police interview with the man accused of murdering Grace Millane, in which he says the British backpacker had accidentally died while being consensually strangled. The 27-year-old New Zealand man, whose identity is suppressed, has pleaded not guilty to the 21-year-old\u2019s murder. In his second formal interview with police, on 8 December, the accused admitted taking Millane back to his hotel room on the night of 1 December after a Tinder date, and said they engaged in rough sex initiated by Millane, evoking scenes she had seen in a film. He said that the next morning, when he realised she had died, he contorted her body into a suitcase. \u201cIt felt wrong,\u201d the man said in the police interview, saying he cried as he carried out the burial and then tried to take an overdose of Panadol and anti-depressant medication to end his life. Prosecutors allege Millane was murdered by the accused in his hotel room. It is not disputed that Millane died in the CityLife hotel by strangulation, and that the accused buried her body in a suitcase. In an initial police interview, the accused told police he parted ways with Millane at 8pm the night before, and that she had then unmatched him on Tinder. The man said after engaging in consensual sex with Millane, he passed out in the shower and when he went back to bed he thought Millane had gone home because the lights were off and he could not see her. When he woke the next morning he saw her body lying next to the bed. \u201cI yelled out at her, I tried to move her to see if she was awake \u2026 I was in shock, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I picked her up and tried to wake her up \u2026 then I was screaming \u2018Grace, Grace\u2019.\u201d \u201cI took a whole lot of tablets that I had because I realised that she was not alive and I just wanted to end it all, for me.\u201d The man said he typed in New Zealand\u2019s emergency number, 111, but didn\u2019t make the call. \u201cI was scared how bad it looked \u2026 there\u2019s a dead person in my room, I thought it looked terrible. I was in utter shock that that had happened.\u201d After discovering her body, the accused admitted he then went to purchase a large suitcase and cleaning products in an attempt to remove evidence of Millane\u2019s blood from the hotel carpet. This account has been corroborated by extensive CCTV footage shown to the jury on Wednesday. The accused said he had no prior experience of strangulation or BDSM sex, contradicting the account of a former partner who told the court earlier in the week that he liked \u201crough sex\u201d involving domination and strangulation. He told the court Millane had initiated that kind of sex, and he discovered that he liked it. \u201cWe were having sex so you have to have trust to have sex,\u201d the accused said, saying he had voiced dissent to the \u201ckinky sex\u201d proposed by Millane, but continued when he discovered he liked it. In the police interview, the accused said he put Millane\u2019s body in the back of a hire car and drove to the Waitakere ranges, a bushland area west of Auckland, and buried her in a shallow grave inside the suitcase. \u201cI went into the bush and I dug a hole, and I sat there, I sat there and I took 20, 30 paracetamol tablets because I didn\u2019t want to be around if Grace wasn\u2019t there, and I didn\u2019t feel like I deserved to be around, because of what happened,\u201d the accused told police. At the conclusion of the interview the accused agreed to take police to Millane\u2019s grave that night. The man told police he had decided to reveal what happened in the hotel room because he wanted \u201cclosure\u201d for Millane\u2019s family. The crown closes its case this week, with the defence to call experts next week. It is unknown at this point whether the accused will give evidence. The trial is set down for four weeks.",

      "bodyText": "Foreign students have started fleeing Hong Kong as political unrest paralysed parts of the city for a fourth day in a row. Many roads were empty and schools were closed as protesters faced off against police and disrupted transport links. Police fired teargas at a group of protesters near Polytechnic University in the morning. In the evening, student demonstrators blocked campus entrances in preparation for further clashes with police. Protesters set tollbooths on fire in tunnels connecting Kowloon and Hong Kong. In recent days, universities have become a focus of battles between riot police and anti-government demonstrators demanding greater democracy. On Tuesday police raided the Chinese University of Hong Kong, setting off violent clashes and a swell of criticism. On Thursday students from Europe as well as mainland China and Taiwan were leaving the city after a night of clashes that resulted in several serious injuries. A 15-year-old believed to have been hit in the head by a teargas canister reportedly sustained a skull fracture, and an elderly worker for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department was struck by an object during a scuffle between protesters and resident. Both were reported to be in critical condition. A man in his 30s dressed in black was found dead in Tsuen Wan in Hong Kong\u2019s New Territories, according to police, who said he appeared to have fallen from a building. Nordic students at Hong Kong Baptist University were being moved after anti-government demonstrators moved on to its grounds, and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) urged its 36 students in Hong Kong to return home.

Police fired more than 1,500 rounds of teargas and more than 1,300 rubber bullets at the demonstrators. The city was paralysed, with much of its public transport suspended and all universities closed. Mainland Chinese students have also fled the unrest, taking advantage of a programme that offers them a week of free accommodation in hotels and hostels in the neighbouring city of Shenzhen. Chinese media reported that one hostel had received more than 80 applications for rooms by Wednesday morning. The Beijing Evening News reported that protesters had broken into the dormitories of mainland students, spray-painting insults on walls and banging on doors. Hong Kong police said on Wednesday that they had helped a group of mainland students leave their campus after it was barricaded by demonstrators.

Press secretary Stephanie Grisham and Trump\u2019s son, Eric, both dismissed it as \u201cboring\u201d, with Eric adding \u201c#Snoozefest\u201d in a tweet.</p> \n  <p>The president himself seemed to have found the historic day soporific, judging by his low energy, croaky voiced performance at a joint press conference with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan which started an hour late.</p> \n  <p>He was accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, five Republican senators and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, wearing a broad smile as he took his seat.</p> \n  <p>Trump, a former reality TV star who follows cable news very closely, claimed he had not watched a minute of the session that poses an existential threat to his presidency. That would be a blow to Republican congressmen who strained to impress him with their questions and speeches.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAre you talking about the witch hunt?\u201d Trump asked a reporter in the White House east room who sought his first impression. \u201cIs that what you mean? Is that what you\u2019re talking about? I hear it\u2019s a joke. I haven\u2019t watched, I haven\u2019t watched for one minute because I\u2019ve been with the president, which is much more important as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cThis is a sham and shouldn\u2019t be allowed. It was a situation that was caused by people that shouldn\u2019t have allowed it to happen. I want to find out who was the whistleblower because the whistleblower gave a lot of very incorrect information including my call with the president of Ukraine, which was a perfect call and highly appropriate.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump will release details of an earlier call he had with Zelinskiy on Thursday, he continued.</p> \n  <p>He said he regretted the country was being put through the hearings and that Erdogan\u2019s time was being wasted. \u201cI\u2019d much rather focus on peace in the Middle East and I hear that it\u2019s a hoax and it\u2019s being played as a hoax. That\u2019s what I hear but you\u2019ll have to tell me.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Perhaps determined to avoid a tough confrontation, Trump gave his two questions to the One America News Network and Fox News, both notorious for backing him. The latter focused on witness Bill Taylor\u2019s disclosure that a staffer overheard Trump saying \u201cthe investigations\u201d mattered more to him than Ukraine\u2019s fate.</p> \n  <p>The president replied: \u201cI know nothing about that. First time I\u2019ve heard it\u2026 In any event, it\u2019s more secondhand information, but I\u2019ve never heard it.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Pressed on whether he recalled the conversation in question, he added: \u201cNot at all, not even a little bit.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On a day that his supporters attempted to portray as anticlimactic, Trump himself lacked the fire and fury he has displayed on previous occasions. He ignored a barrage of shouted questions as he left the east room, the scene of Richard Nixon\u2019s raw, emotional farewell following his 1974 resignation.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dcc8a668f08aab51e1be9dc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-13T23:11:41.282Z\">11.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Department of defense watchdog declined Democratic senators' request to investigate Ukraine funds holdup</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Responding to a request by a group of Democratic senators, including Dick Durbin of Illinois, acting inspector general Glenn Fine said he wouldn\u2019t open an investigation that duplicates work being done by members of Congress leading the impeachment inquiry. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe seek not to duplicate or interfere with the efforts of other oversight entities, even if there is not a criminal proceeding, before initiating our own investigation,\u201d Fine said in a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6548831-DOD-IG-Letter.html\">letter</a> to Durbin.</p> \n  <p>After the impeachment inquiry closes, \u201cwe would again consider investigating such DoD matters that have not been sufficiently addressed\u201d, Fine said. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-14T00:37:24.042Z\">at 12.37am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dcc83858f08eeb483f17071\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-13T22:44:07.834Z\">10.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ruth Bader Ginsberg is absent from the Supreme Court due to illness</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09e907543ab206984cbb5b3ca37078d1e654f73b\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09e907543ab206984cbb5b3ca37078d1e654f73b/0_128_3837_2302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg missed oral arguments today for the second time since she took office in 1993.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg missed oral arguments today for the second time since she took office in 1993.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Ginsberg missed oral arguments today due to a stomach bug, the high court announced. </p> \n  <p>\u201cShe is indisposed due to illness, but she will participate in the consideration and decision of the cases on the basis of the briefs and the transcripts or recordings of the oral arguments,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts said. </p> \n  <p>At 86, Ginsberg is the court\u2019s oldest member.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Thursday\u2019s blog: That\u2019s a wrap for today. Here\u2019s a recap: On the first day of public impeachment hearings, Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, testified that one of his aides heard from EU ambassador Gordon Sondland that Trump cared more about investigations into Joe Biden and his son than other US-Ukrainian policies. David Holmes, Taylor\u2019s aide who reportedly also overheard a conversation between Trump and Sondland, during which they discussed \u2018the investigations.\u2019 has been asked to appear for a closed-door deposition with impeachment investigators on Friday. Republican allies of Trump tried to paint the testimony of Taylor and George Kent as hearsay Trump and his allies have also said the hearing was dull and irrelevant, with the president claiming he didn\u2019t watch a minute of it. Judges ruled for the third time that Congress can move forward with a subpoena to obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns. The president\u2019s lawyers had said they\u2019ll appeal to the Supreme Court. The Department of Defense watchdog declined Republican senators\u2019 request to separately investigate the holdup of aid to Ukraine. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick has reportedly decided to enter the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. Ruth Bader Ginsberg missed oral arguments today for the second time in her career as a supreme court justice. She was reportedly suffering from a stomach bug. Tune in tomorrow for more developments on the impeachment hearings, and the 2020 presidential race. A federal appeals court ruled today that House Democrats can have access to Trump\u2019s tax returns, and subpoena his longtime accounting firm. The House Oversight committee had subpoenaed Mazars, Trump\u2019s accounting firm, earlier this year. The president sued the House panel in response, arguing that they were stretching Congress\u2019 investigative powers. A lower court ruled against Trump in May, and a three-judge panel of DC circuit judges upheld the decision in October. Trump\u2019s lawyers asked the circuit court to rehear the argument once again, and today for a third time, judges stood by Congress\u2019 right to subpoena. Trump\u2019s lawyers now plan to appeal to the Supreme Court. A historic opening prayer at the House Some non-impeachment news courtesy of The Guardian\u2019s Nina Lakhani: Isleta Pueblo Chief Judge Verna Teller has become the first Native American to deliver the opening prayer on the floor of the House of Representatives - 240 years after the tradition began. \u201cOh Creator and Great Mother. Having asked and received your permission to invoke your blessings today to all directions: East, North, West, South and the Center. We thank you for the life you give to all your children: the two-legged ones, the four-legged, those who live in the waters, and those who watch over us from the skies above. Sacred Pollen, sacred Earth Mother, sacred Water that manifest your desires, oh Creator and Great Mother, we thank them for the nourishment they give us equally with no regard to race, color or creed. Creator and Great Mother bless those standing before you, who carry a sacred trust to all of us who inhabit Turtle Island, our homeland, and I pray today that you will give them the wisdom and the courage to carry out their sacred trust with the same equality that we receive from the Sun and Rain. Hurrd kem. (Thank you)\u201d Chief Judge Teller from New Mexico was invited by Congresswoman Deb Haaland, who is a member of the Laguna Pueblo people, as part of events to mark Native American heritage month. \u201c[This] is a time to reflect on the contributions that our Native communities have made to this country and the tragedies that they endured. Having Verna Teller on the House Floor does both \u2013 it reminds us that in the 200-plus years of our country\u2019s history, the first people of this continent were excluded, but also that through resilience and perseverance we are still here and working to make our country a better place,\u201d said Congresswoman Deb Haalan. In 2018, New Mexico Rep Haaland and Sharice Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation who represents Kansas, became the first Native American woman elected to Congress. The current house chaplain is Father Patrick Conroy, the first Jesuit and second Catholic to hold the position of spiritual advisor to US lawmakers. The Guardian\u2019s Washington correspondent David Smith: The White House and its allies sought to dismiss the hearing as dull and irrelevant. Press secretary Stephanie Grisham and Trump\u2019s son, Eric, both dismissed it as \u201cboring\u201d, with Eric adding \u201c#Snoozefest\u201d in a tweet. The president himself seemed to have found the historic day soporific, judging by his low energy, croaky voiced performance at a joint press conference with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan which started an hour late. He was accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, five Republican senators and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, wearing a broad smile as he took his seat. Trump, a former reality TV star who follows cable news very closely, claimed he had not watched a minute of the session that poses an existential threat to his presidency. That would be a blow to Republican congressmen who strained to impress him with their questions and speeches. \u201cAre you talking about the witch hunt?\u201d Trump asked a reporter in the White House east room who sought his first impression. \u201cIs that what you mean? Is that what you\u2019re talking about? I hear it\u2019s a joke. I haven\u2019t watched, I haven\u2019t watched for one minute because I\u2019ve been with the president, which is much more important as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is a sham and shouldn\u2019t be allowed. It was a situation that was caused by people that shouldn\u2019t have allowed it to happen. I want to find out who was the whistleblower because the whistleblower gave a lot of very incorrect information including my call with the president of Ukraine, which was a perfect call and highly appropriate.\u201d Trump will release details of an earlier call he had with Zelinskiy on Thursday, he continued. He said he regretted the country was being put through the hearings and that Erdogan\u2019s time was being wasted. \u201cI\u2019d much rather focus on peace in the Middle East and I hear that it\u2019s a hoax and it\u2019s being played as a hoax. That\u2019s what I hear but you\u2019ll have to tell me.\u201d Perhaps determined to avoid a tough confrontation, Trump gave his two questions to the One America News Network and Fox News, both notorious for backing him. The latter focused on witness Bill Taylor\u2019s disclosure that a staffer overheard Trump saying \u201cthe investigations\u201d mattered more to him than Ukraine\u2019s fate. The president replied: \u201cI know nothing about that. First time I\u2019ve heard it\u2026 In any event, it\u2019s more secondhand information, but I\u2019ve never heard it.\u201d Pressed on whether he recalled the conversation in question, he added: \u201cNot at all, not even a little bit.\u201d On a day that his supporters attempted to portray as anticlimactic, Trump himself lacked the fire and fury he has displayed on previous occasions. He ignored a barrage of shouted questions as he left the east room, the scene of Richard Nixon\u2019s raw, emotional farewell following his 1974 resignation. Responding to a request by a group of Democratic senators, including Dick Durbin of Illinois, acting inspector general Glenn Fine said he wouldn\u2019t open an investigation that duplicates work being done by members of Congress leading the impeachment inquiry. \u201cWe seek not to duplicate or interfere with the efforts of other oversight entities, even if there is not a criminal proceeding, before initiating our own investigation,\u201d Fine said in a letter to Durbin. After the impeachment inquiry closes, \u201cwe would again consider investigating such DoD matters that have not been sufficiently addressed\u201d, Fine said. Ginsberg missed oral arguments today due to a stomach bug, the high court announced. \u201cShe is indisposed due to illness, but she will participate in the consideration and decision of the cases on the basis of the briefs and the transcripts or recordings of the oral arguments,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts said. At 86, Ginsberg is the court\u2019s oldest member. She leads the liberal wing of the court. In January, she missed oral arguments for the first time since taking office, as she was recovering from surgery. The Supreme Court was hearing arguments today regarding two cases: Comcast Corporation v. National Association of African American-Owned Media and Ritzen Group, Inc. v. Jackson Masonry, LLC. Ginsberg will still be able to weigh in on those cases, though she missed the chance to question attorneys today. The president just said during his press conference with Turkey\u2019s Erdogan that he can\u2019t recall the reported phone call with European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland on July 26 that caused such a splash at the impeachment inquiry because it portrayed Trump as prioritizing efforts by Ukraine to investigate his political rivals over any other aspect of US-Ukraine relations. Earlier today, witness and acting US ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, said one of his aides had heard Sondland talking to Trump on the phone on July 26, and could also overhear the president on the other end conversing loudly. Taylor told the hearing: \u201cFollowing the phone call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which [Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy] Giuliani was pressing for.\u201d All of this has apparently slipped Trump\u2019s mind. Here\u2019s the full story. The handshake Trump and Erdogan have wrapped up their unsettling press conference at the White House with a hearty handshake that leaves many watching deeply uneasy. Trump-Erdogan presser calls on \u201cfriendly reporter\u201d Trump on Syria: \u201cThere for the oil\u201d Donald Trump has insisted that the US military presence in Syria is \u201conly for the oil\u201d, contradicting his own officials who have insisted that the remaining forces were there to fight Isis, Guardian US world affairs editor Julian Borger writes. Trump made his remarks while hosting Recep Tayyip Erdogan, just over a month after the Turkish president launched an offensive into northeastern Syria, which has been formally condemned as destabilising by state department officials. Sitting alongside Erdogan, Trump contradicted his own officials and the Republican leadership on a range of issues, most importantly on the US military mission in Syria. Following Trump\u2019s earlier insistence that his administration was solely interested in \u201ckeeping\u201d Syrian oil, the US military deployed mechanised military units to oil fields in the east of the country. However, seizing or benefiting from oil on a foreign territory, without permission from the sovereign authority, would be a violation of international law. Several US officials had sought to interpret the president\u2019s remarks as the US meant to meaning that the denying Isis access to the oil. The US special envoy on Syria, James Jeffrey, said on Monday: \u201cUS forces in northeastern Syria are there under an authorisation to fight terrorism specifically to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS. That is their overall mission.\u201d Julian\u2019s story is here and it will be updated shortly as a result of the presser. Donald Trump and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan are holding a press conference in the White House now. That\u2019s it from me on this historic day. My Guardian colleagues will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands after the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry: Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, testified that one of his aides overheard a conversation between Trump and Gordon Sondland where the president asked the US ambassador to the EU about \u201cthe investigations\u201d in Ukraine. According to Taylor, Sondland told the aide that Trump cared more about investigations into Joe Biden and his son than other US-Ukrainian policies. David Holmes, the aide who reportedly overheard the conversation between Trump and Sondland, has been asked to appear for a closed-door deposition with impeachment investigators on Friday. Republican allies of Trump tried to paint the testimony of Taylor and George Kent as the result of hearsay, noting that neither official had spoken with the president. (But Trump has tried to block his closest aides from testifying in the inquiry.) On a non-impeachment note: Deval Patrick has reportedly decided to launch a 2020 bid. However, the former Democratic governor of Massachusetts faces long odds given his late entry and need to fundraise. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. The motion from Republican representative Mike Conaway to subpoena the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry was defeated on a party-line vote. With that, the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry has concluded. The next hearing is scheduled for Friday morning, when former US ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch will testify publicly. Three major US newspapers highlighted the new testimony from Bill Taylor in their homepage headlines about the first public impeachment hearing. New York Times: \u201cImpeachment Testimony: \u2018Trump Cares More About the Investigations of Biden.\u2019\u201d Washington Post: \u201cNew testimony ties Trump more directly to Ukraine pressure.\u201d Wall Street Journal: \u201cEnvoy Reveals New Call in Impeachment Testimony as GOP Defends Trump.\u201d Taylor testified that one of his aides overheard Trump asking about \u201cthe investigations\u201d in Ukraine and that Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, said the president cared more about the probes into Joe Biden and his son than other US-Ukrainian policies. Bill Taylor and George Kent have now concluded their testimony in the first public hearing of the impeachment inquiry after about five and a half hours. Republicans on the committee and Trump\u2019s allies tried to paint the hearing as a \u201cboring\u201d waster of time. However, the homepages of major news outlets would beg to differ. Asked about what interests they believed Rudy Giuliani was promoting in Ukraine, George Kent said of the president\u2019s personal lawyer: \u201cI believe he was looking to dig up political dirt against a potential rival.\u201d Reports have indicated Giuliani spent months trying to pressure Ukrainian officials to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Republican representative Jim Jordan once again called on the whistleblower whose complaint initiated the impeachment inquiry to testify publicly. Adam Schiff has said he remains committed to protecting the anonymity of the whistleblower, and he has already rejected Republicans\u2019 request to have the unnamed official testify. But Democratic representative Peter Welch offered an alternative to Jordan: \u201cI\u2019ll be glad to have the person who started it all come in and testify. President Trump is welcome to take a seat right there.\u201d The suggestion prompted chuckles from the Democrats in the room, but Republicans were more reserved in their response. The blog is briefly interrupting its coverage of the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry to provide a key update on the 2020 race: former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick has reportedly decided to enter the Democratic presidential primary. CNN reports: Patrick is telling friends and allies in phone calls on Wednesday that he has made a decision to run for president, two people familiar with the matter say. Plans for the timing of his formal announcement are still in flux, with attention on impeachment, but Patrick is likely to reveal his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination by video or social media message on Thursday, with a formal appearance in New Hampshire on Friday to file his papers for the primary there with the secretary of state\u2019s office, one person familiar with the plan says. The odds could be incredibly steep for a late entrant like Patrick, who is not well known nationally and does not have personal wealth to finance a campaign. Patrick has missed the deadline to appear on the primary ballot in Alabama and Arkansas. Although Patrick faces many hurdles in the primary race, his entry indicates that some prominent Democrats remain unsure about their 2020 options. We are (slowly) nearing the end of the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry. Republican representative Will Hurd has concluded his questioning, and six more Democrats on the committee will be allowed five minutes each. Correction: A previous version of this post included a tweet identifying Hurd as the last Republican questioner, but he was not. Asked by Democratic representative Eric Swalwell, Bill Taylor and George Kent denied they are \u201cnever Trumpers,\u201d as the president has alleged. Kent, a longtime state department official, emphasized he has worked under five presidents -- three Republicans and two Democrats -- and has consistently served as a nonpartisan public servant. Taylor was also first nominated as US ambassador to Ukraine by former Republican president George W. Bush. In response to comments made by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Taylor emphasized it is \u201cwrong\u201d to hold up security assistance for \u201cno good policy reason.\u201d Many of the Democratic presidential candidates have been remarking on today\u2019s impeachment hearings. Here\u2019s what they\u2019ve had to say: Republican representative Chris Stewart opened his questioning of Bill Taylor and George Kent by welcoming Americans to \u201cyear four of the impeachment of President Trump.\u201d This echoes a common line of argument among Republicans: that Democrats have been determined to impeach Trump since day one and are searching for any reason to justify his removal from office. However, in reality, many House Democrats only came around to supporting an impeachment inquiry in the immediate weeks before Nancy Pelosi formally launched the investigation at the end of September. Trump\u2019s press secretary is trumpeting efforts by Republicans on the House intelligence committee to paint Bill Taylor and George Kent\u2019s testimony as the result of hearsay, emphasizing that neither ever spoke with the president. However, a number of commentators responded to Grisham\u2019s argument by noting that the White House has tried to block the testimony of officials who regularly speak to Trump. Representative Mike Turner\u2019s combative questioning of Bill Taylor and George Kent represented quite a reversal from a September hearing with the acting director of national intelligence, during which the Republican congressman expressed concern about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. Representative Mike Turner, a more moderate Republican on the House intelligence committee, just grilled Bill Taylor and George Kent and dismissed their testimony as the result of hearsay. The combative performance by one of the more moderate Republicans on the committee demonstrated once again that the likely eventual vote on articles of impeachment against Trump will almost certainly fall along party lines. Bill Taylor has had to repeatedly emphasize his nonpartisan position while taking questions from the Republican members of the House intelligence committee. Representative John Ratcliffe, whom Trump previously planned to nominate as director of national intelligence, asked Taylor and George Kent whether they believed anything impeachable had occurred. \u201cI\u2019m not here to do anything having to do with, to decide about impeachment,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat is not what either of us are here to do. This is your job.\u201d Jim Jordan belittled the testimony of Bill Taylor and expressed bafflement that his Democratic colleagues consider the longtime diplomat to be their \u201cstar witness.\u201d Taylor responded by again emphasizing he was not testifying to help the political fortunes of either party. \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself a star witness for anything,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to take one side or the other.\u201d Taylor, who currently serves as the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, was first nominated to the post in Kyiv by former Republican president George W Bush. Jim Jordan, a Trump ally, echoed Republican messaging by trying to paint Bill Taylor\u2019s knowledge of a potential quid pro quo as relying on secondhand information. However, this argument may fall apart next week, when a number of people who do have direct knowledge of the pressure campaign on Ukraine -- namely Gordon Sondland and Alexander Vindman -- testify publicly. That said, Jordan appears to have succeeded at his short-term goal of creating a clip of Taylor acknowledging he did not listen to Trump\u2019s Ukraine call or discuss a potential announcement of investigations with the Ukrainian president. It seems likely that exchange will play on Fox News tonight. The Democratic and Republican counsels have concluded their questioning, and the hearing has moved on to five-minute questioning from each member of the committee. Representative Jim Jordan, one of the president\u2019s closest allies, is now pressing Bill Taylor on his testimony that Ukraine\u2019s military aid was tied to public announcements of investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. The Republican counsel appeared to be trying to get Bill Taylor to justify the Trump administration\u2019s odd decision-making structure around Ukraine policy, prompting looks of bafflement of bemusement from the longtime diplomat. The counsel for Republican members of the House intelligence committee, Steve Castor, is pressing Bill Taylor and George Kent on Hunter Biden\u2019s qualifications to join the board of the Ukrainian company Burisma. Given their decades of experience in public service, Taylor and Kent are unsurprisingly unfamiliar with the resume of Biden, the son of former vice president Joe Biden. Kent and Taylor responded to a number of Castor\u2019s questions about Biden\u2019s qualifications by simply saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Kent has testified he raised concerns in 2015 about the appearance of a conflict of interest in the younger Biden\u2019s work for Burisma, but he emphasized he had seen no evidence of US officials hesitating to examine the company because of Biden\u2019s role on the board. As Bill Taylor began his testimony this morning, there was a a stark difference in the coverage on Fox News and elsewhere. A box appeared next to Taylor onscreen, nominally giving background information on the acting US ambassador to Ukraine. Intriguingly, that background information was sourced from Donald Trump and the GOP\u2019s criticism of Taylor. \u201cPresident Trump dismissed Taylor as a \u2018never Trumper\u2019,\u201d Fox News informed its viewers. It added: \u201cWhite House called Taylor\u2019s closed-door testimony \u2018triple hearsay\u2019.\u201d Fox News offered less information on the actual substance of Taylor\u2019s testimony: in which he said he had a \u201cclear understanding\u201d that the release of US aid was tied to Ukraine investigating the Bidens. Specifically, it offered no information. Other than that, Fox News has so far done its best to present Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony as un-explosive. As the rest of the media has marveled at Bill Taylor\u2019s statement that Trump \u201ccared more about investigations of Biden\u201d than Ukraine policy, and that a Taylor staffer overheard a Trump phone call where the president asked about \u201cthe investigations\u201d, much of Fox News\u2019 coverage has adopted a \u201cnothing to see here\u201d approach. Across television news coverage, CNN, ABC and MSNBC have repeatedly changed their chyrons to represent the latest revelations from Taylor and George Kent\u2019s testimony, Fox News has kept its own on-screen text staunchly neutral: \u201cTAYLOR AND KENT TESTIFY IN FIRST IMPEACHMENT HEARING.\u201d It was also the only channel to cut to an adbreak as Adam Schiff began questioning the two officials. Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary for George W Bush, criticized the questioning of the lawyer speaking for the Republican members of the House intelligence committee. Republicans on the House intelligence committee appear to be using their questioning time to add credibility to the baseless conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. (The US intelligence community has thoroughly confirmed that Russia interfered in the election.) But it is worth noting that Republicans have not yet sought to counter Bill Taylor and George Kent\u2019s testimony outlining a months-long campaign by Trump\u2019s allies to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. Representative Mark Meadows, one of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, spoke to reporters during the recess of the first public impeachment hearing. Asked about Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony that one of his staffers overheard Trump asking about \u201cinvestigations\u201d in Ukraine, Meadows said, \u201cEverybody has their impression of what truth is.\u201d It looks like the White House and its allies may be resuscitating \u201calternative facts\u201d to push back against the impeachment inquiry. The first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry has resumed, and the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, Devin Nunes, has started his questioning. But \u201cquestioning\u201d is a pretty loose term here because Nunes is currently using his time to accuse Democrats of misrepresenting Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine without posing questions to Bill Taylor or George Kent. During her morning caucus meeting, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said that Democrats need a \u201ccommon narrative\u201d as they continue with public impeachment hearings. Pelosi once again emphasized the message around the hearings should be that no president, including Trump, is \u201cabove the law.\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has arrived at the White House for his visit with Trump, and the pair will have a joint press conference at 3.10pm ET. When asked by pool reporters about the public impeachment hearing, Trump said, \u201cIt\u2019s a witch hunt, it\u2019s a hoax. I\u2019m too busy to watch it. I have not been briefed.\u201d He added, \u201cThey\u2019re using lawyers that are television lawyers.\u201d One of the biggest new lines to come out today\u2019s impeachment hearing so far comes from Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony that US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, told one of Taylor\u2019s aides in July that Trump cared more about \u201cinvestigations of Biden\u201d than US policies towards Ukraine. Here\u2019s the moment in Taylor\u2019s testimony: And here\u2019s how some political commentators have responded: The first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry has paused for a five-minute recess. When the hearing resumes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee and the minority\u2019s lawyer will get the chance to question Bill Taylor and George Kent. The Republican National Committee is already criticizing the testimony of Bill Taylor, emphasizing the diplomat was told secondhand that Ukraine\u2019s military assistance was held up to demand public announcements of investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. However, that argument may not last long considering one of the people who told Taylor this, Gordon Sondland, will testify publicly next week. Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony that his staffer overheard a phone call between Trump and the US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, in which the president asked about \u201cinvestigations\u201d in Ukraine casts great doubt on Sondland\u2019s testimony to the House intelligence committee. The White House Twitter account just shared a video of Trump slamming the impeachment inquiry as the \u201csingle greatest scam in the history of American politics.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re fighting to drain the swamp, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Trump said in the video as longtime diplomats simultaneously testified to efforts by the president\u2019s allies to have Ukraine launch an investigation of Joe Biden. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, similarly sent a tweet calling the public hearing with Bill Taylor and George Kent a \u201csham\u201d and a \u201ccolossal waste of taxpayer time &amp; money.\u201d Bill Taylor told impeachment investigators that he was particularly alarmed by White House efforts to leverage Ukraine\u2019s military assistance as Trump\u2019s allies sought investigations into Joe Biden and his son. As Bill Taylor and George Kent publicly testify, House Democrats just announced two more planned closed-door interviews in the impeachment inquiry with David Holmes, an aide to Taylor, and Mark Sandry, an official at the White House office of management and budget who previously refused to testify. Holmes may well be the aide who overheard Gordon Sondland\u2019s conversation with Trump, in which the president asked the US ambassador to the EU about the \u201cinvestigations\u201d in Ukraine. The White House claimed Trump is not watching the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry. However, the president just retweeted 10 messages from Republican accounts pushing back against the inquiry, including this one with a clip from the hearing. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, opened his questioning of Bill Taylor by following up on the diplomat\u2019s new testimony that his staffer overheard Trump asking about \u201cinvestigations\u201d in Ukraine. Taylor confirmed his staffer told him that Trump was speaking loudly on the phone to Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU. The staffer overheard Trump ask about \u201cinvestigations,\u201d which Taylor understood to mean Ukrainian investigations into the 2016 election and Joe Biden. According to Taylor, Sondland then told the staffer that Trump cared more about an investigation into Biden than other US-Ukrainian policies. Here is Bill Taylor\u2019s full account of his staffer overhearing Trump asking about \u201cinvestigations\u201d in Ukraine, which the longtime diplomat just shared with the House intelligence committee: \u201cLast Friday, a member of my staff told me of events that occurred on July 26. While Ambassador Volker and I visited the front, this member of my staff accompanied Ambassador Sondland. Ambassador Sondland met with [a senior adviser to the Ukrainian president, Mr. Yermak]. Following that meeting, in the presence of my staff at a restaurant, Ambassador Sondland called President Trump and told him of his meetings in Kyiv. \u201cThe member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone, asking Ambassador Sondland about \u2018the investigations.\u2019 Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward. \u201cFollowing the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for. \u201cAt the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information. I am including it here for completeness. As the Committee knows, I reported this information through counsel to the State Department\u2019s Legal Adviser, as well as to counsel for both the Majority and the Minority on the Committee. It is my understanding that the Committee is following up on this matter.\u201d Echoing his closed-door testimony, Bill Taylor said in his opening statement that he was told \u201ceverything\u201d Ukraine sought, including a White House visit and the frozen military aid, was tied to a public announcement of investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. The acting US ambassador to Ukraine said of a conversation he had in early September, \u201cAmbassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling Ukrainian officials that only a White House meeting with President Zelenskyy was dependent on a public announcement of investigations\u2014in fact, Ambassador Sondland said, \u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance. \u201cHe said that President Trump wanted President Zelenskyy \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.\u201d The opening statements from Democratic chair, Adam Schiff, and the senior Republican on the committee, Devin Nunes, reflected the broader messaging battle that has surrounded the impeachment proceedings since they were announced in late September, with Democrats accusing Trump of corruption and Republicans accusing Democrats of running an unfair process. Schiff said the public impeachment hearings would explore whether Trump sought to exploit Ukraine\u2019s vulnerability, condition White House acts on Ukraine\u2019s willingness to help his reelection, and \u201cwhether such an abuse of his power is compatible with the presidency.\u201d \u201cThe matter is as simple and as terrible as that,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cOur answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency but the future of the presidency itself. \u201cIs this what Americans should now expect from their president? If this is not impeachable conduct, what is?\u201d In response, Nunes declared the proceedings \u201ca carefully orchestrated media smear campaign\u201d and a \u201chorrifically one-sided process.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than an impeachment process in search of a crime,\u201d he said. Three Republicans interrupted the proceedings just as the witnesses, Bill Taylor and George Kent, began testifying with demands that the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint launched the impeachment inquiry be called to testify. Schiff rebuffed the demands, but there are likely to be more later. The White House claimed Trump is not tuning in to the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry, even though his public schedule is clear until noon. \u201cHe\u2019s in the Oval in meetings. Not watching. He\u2019s working,\u201d said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. However, Trump just retweeted a White House video with the caption, \u201cNew hoax. Same swamp.\u201d More new information from Bill Taylor: the acting US ambassador to Ukraine said a number of senior administration officials, including CIA director Gina Haspel, tried to convince Trump to lift the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military aid. According to Bill Taylor\u2019s prepared remarks, one of his staffers overheard a phone call between Trump and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, in which the president asked about \u201cthe investigations.\u201d Taylor informed impeachment investigators Sondland told the staffer that Trump cared more about an investigation into Joe Biden and his son than other US-Ukrainian policies. Taylor noted he was not aware of the conversation when he originally testified behind closed doors and was thus adding it to his opening statement now. Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, is delivering his opening statement and similarly emphasizing his long career working for both Republican and Democratic presidents. Taylor also recounted recent US-Ukrainian history and described the \u201cencouraging, confusing and ultimately alarming circumstances\u201d he encountered when he arrived in Kyiv. It seems likely that Trump will be displeased with the testimony of the longtime diplomat and Vietnam War veteran, given the president\u2019s preference for officials who look they came from \u201ccentral casting.\u201d George Kent acknowledged that, in 2015, he raised concerns about the appearance of a conflict of interest in Hunter Biden\u2019s work for the Ukrainian company Burisma. However, the longtime diplomat pushed back against Republicans\u2019 suggestion that there may have been corruption involved in Biden\u2019s work with the company. \u201cIn February 2015, I raised my concern that Hunter Biden\u2019s status as board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest,\u201d Kent said. \u201cLet me be clear; however, I did not witness any efforts by any U.S. official to shield Burisma from scrutiny.\u201d In his opening statement, George Kent emphasized his role as a \u201cnon-partisan career Foreign Service officer\u201d and his family\u2019s long history of public service. \u201cToday I appear before you once again, under subpoena, as a fact witness ready to answer all of your questions about the events and developments examined in this inquiry to the best of my ability and recollection subject to limits placed on me by the law and this process,\u201d Kent said. According to his prepared remarks, Kent will tell impeachment investigators that he was \u201calarmed\u201d by efforts to oust former US ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch and that the campaign for public announcements of Ukrainian investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election was \u201cinfecting US engagement with Ukraine\u201d. George Kent, who oversees the state department\u2019s Ukraine policy and previously testified to Trump allies\u2019 efforts to oust the former US ambassador to Ukraine, is now delivering his opening statement. Before Kent began speaking, a few Republican members of the House intelligence committee pressed chairman Adam Schiff on calling the whistleblower whose complaint initiated the impeachment inquiry to testify. Schiff replied that he would remain committed to protecting the whistleblower\u2019s anonymity and turned things over to Kent. Bill Taylor and George Kent have been sworn in and will soon deliver their opening statements before taking questions in the first public impeachment hearing. But Republicans have already started to interrupt the proceedings by raising points of order about Adam Schiff\u2019s decision to approve only some of the minority\u2019s witness requests. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, is using his opening statement to slam his Democratic colleagues for allegedly running a \u201chorrifically one-sided process.\u201d Nunes lambasted Democrats\u2019 \u201cscorched-earth war\u201d against Trump and accused them of pursuing a \u201ccarefully orchestrated media smear campaign.\u201d Nunes also criticized Adam Schiff for denying Republicans\u2019 request to interview Hunter Biden, even though the committee chairman did approve three of the minority\u2019s witness requests. Schiff said Biden, as well as the whistleblower whose complaint initiated the impeachment inquiry, were outside the scope of the investigation. Schiff used his opening statement to preemptively push back against Trump allies\u2019 argument that there was no pressure campaign on Ukraine because the country\u2019s military aid was eventually released. \u201cA scheme to condition official acts or taxpayer funding to obtain a personal political benefit does not become less odious because it is discovered before it is fully consummated,\u201d Schiff said. The committee chairman also noted the aid was so delayed that it will require another act of Congress to ensure its dispersal. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, is making his opening statement and using it to outline Democrats\u2019 argument that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate a political rival as he held up the country\u2019s military aid. \u201cThe facts in the present inquiry are not seriously contested,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cBeginning in January of this year, the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, pressed Ukrainian authorities to investigate Burisma, the country\u2019s largest natural gas producer, and the Bidens, since Vice President Joe Biden was seen as a strong potential challenger to Trump.\u201d Schiff also criticized Trump for refusing to cooperate with the impeachment investigation. \u201cThese actions will force Congress to consider, as it did with President Nixon, whether Trump\u2019s obstruction of the constitutional duties of Congress constitute additional grounds for impeachment,\u201d Schiff said. Hello from Room 1100 of the House Longworth building, where members of the House Intelligence committee are now seated for the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry against Donald J Trump. The Republicans have decorated the ornate hearing room, one of the grandest in the Capitol, with three large placards that include an out-of-context quote by Democratic congressman Al Green, a longtime proponent of impeachment, a tweet by the anonymous Whistleblower\u2019s lawyer and 93 \u2013 which the sign says is the number of days since chairman Adam Schiff learned the identity of the whistleblower who touched off this inquiry. There are roughly 150 seats for the press and the public. Yours truly is squeezed to the left, with a clear view of the dais. A scrum of photographers encircled the desk where George Kent and Bill Taylor will testify, clicking with abandon. A few lawmakers, mostly Trump\u2019s allies, have wandered into the front row to sit in on the hearing, including Mark Meadows, Lee Zeldin and Louie Gohmert. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, has gaveled in the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry. Schiff and the committee\u2019s ranking member, Devin Nunes, will make opening statements before allowing today\u2019s witnesses, George Kent and Bill Taylor, to make their own statements. Well, this should make for good television: George Conway, who is married to senior White House adivser Kellyanne Conway, will be on MSNBC commenting on the public impeachment hearing. George Conway has previously been incredibly critical of Trump\u2019s presidency and has called for his impeachment. Republican and Democratic members of the House intelligence committee have already set up some of the exhibits they intend to use to make their arguments during this morning\u2019s public hearing. Republicans had posters printed out blaming Adam Schiff, the committee chairman, for not identifying the whistleblower whose complaint kicked off the Ukraine scandal. The GOP members also highlighted a 2017 tweet from one of the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers predicting Trump\u2019s impeachment. Meanwhile, the Democrats appeared ready to highlight comments that acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney made during a press conference last month. During that press conference, Mulvaney appeared to confirm the existence of a quid pro quo in connection to Ukraine\u2019s frozen military aid, but he later walked back that admission. A House official working on the impeachment inquiry confirmed that Bill Taylor and George Kent were subpoenaed to publicly testify today. \u201cThe House Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas this morning to Ambassador William Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent prior to the public hearing,\u201d the official said. Some White House staffers have chosen to defy congressional subpoenas, but several administration officials -- including Taylor and Kent -- have testified after receiving them, despite Trump\u2019s resistance. And both witnesses have now arrived on Capitol Hill for their public testimony, which is scheduled to begin in about 20 minutes. The first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry is set to begin in about half an hour, and the Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino will be providing updates from inside the hearing room. A number of journalists and spectators have gathered in the large hearing room in the Longworth House office building to hear today\u2019s testimony -- including some unexpected characters ... Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, has arrived on Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment inquiry alongside George Kent. Taylor previously testified behind closed doors that he was told Ukraine\u2019s military aid was held up to pressure the country into publicly announcing investigations of Joe Biden and the 2016 election. Visitors to Capitol Hill hoping to witness a piece of history started lining up at 3:30 a.m. E.T. to get a seat in the hearing room where the first public impeachment testimony will be heard. This morning\u2019s hearing will take place in Room 1100 of the Longworth House office building, which previously served as the temporary House chamber while the main chamber was undergoing reconstruction in 1949 and 1950. It appears that Trump has got his messaging straight for the morning. If his Twitter feed is any indication, the president would like his supporters to believe the two state department officials testifying this morning, Bill Taylor and George Kent, are \u201cnever Trumpers\u201d who are misrepresenting his communications with Ukraine. The \u201ctranscript\u201d the president referenced is actually the White House memo on Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. Trump has cited the memo as evidence of how \u201cperfect\u201d the call was, but in reality, it shows the president asking Ukraine for a \u201cfavor\u201d and going on to discuss baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden. In terms of the partisan leanings of the today\u2019s witnesses, Taylor was first nominated to serve as US ambassador to Ukraine by former Republican president George W. Bush, and Kent is a career diplomat who has worked under both Democratic and Republican administrations. All eyes will be on Capitol Hill this morning, but Trump also has a busy day scheduled that could have a significant effect on the future of the Middle East. Trump will greet Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan at the White House just weeks after the Turkish president launched a violent military operation in northern Syria, following the withdrawal of US troops from the region. The two presidents will speak at a joint press conference scheduled for 3:10 p.m. E.T., which will be closely watched for signs of what Trump has agreed to when it comes to the future of Syria. A number of lawmakers encouraged Trump to cancel his planned meeting with the strongman leader after the attack on America\u2019s Kurdish allies, but the president chose to go ahead with it. During a speech at the Economic Club in New York yesterday, Trump offered this rationale for meeting with all types of world leaders: \u201cAnybody who wants to come in -- dictators, it\u2019s OK -- come on in, whatever\u2019s good for the United States.\u201d Carl Bernstein, one of the reporters who broke the Watergate scandal that led to the impeachment inquiry into President Richard Nixon and his 1974 resignation, has offered his assessment that America is in \u201cthe middle of a cold civil war\u201d and the outcome of the impeachment hearings into Donald Trump will be judged in that context. \u201cTrump has demonstrated remarkable support, especially given the unprecedented nature of his words and actions and attitude as President,\u201d Bernstein told CNN in an email. \u201cThe impeachment push by Dems -- given this dynamic of Cold Civil War could conceivably backfire\u201d in the court of public opinion. \u201cNo one knows what is going to happen in the coming weeks or months, except likely impeachment by the House, because of the Democratic majority\u2026 As for the results of a Senate trial or the remainder of Trump\u2019s term or the 2020 election, anything is possible.\u201d The fist public hearing in the impeachment inquiry is set to start in less than two hours, but Democrats have already announced the next steps in the investigation. Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from her post in the spring, will testify publicly on Friday morning. And Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, announced yesterday that eight more witnesses will testify next week. Three of the newly announced witnesses \u2013 Volker, Morrison and Hale \u2013 were requested by Republicans on the committee, which will throw some cold water on arguments from Trump and his allies that Democrats are presenting a one-sided argument. However, Schiff rejected some of Republicans\u2019 other witness requests, including the whistleblower and Hunter Biden. The committee chairman also implicitly warned in a memo yesterday that anyone who attempts to name the anonymous whistleblower, whose complaint kicked off the Ukraine controversy, could face an ethical investigation. Good morning, live blog readers! Well, we\u2019ve arrived. Public hearings begin this morning in the impeachment inquiry, marking only the fourth time in American history that such proceedings have occurred. Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasian Affairs, are scheduled to testify at 10am on Capitol Hill. Taylor previously told impeachment investigators that he was informed Ukraine\u2019s military assistance was held up to pressure the country into announce investigations of Joe Biden and the 2016 election. Kent testified in his closed-door interview to the House committees that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, led a \u201ccampaign of lies\u201d against the former US ambassador to Ukraine. Donald Trump is facing the investigation that could spell the end of his presidency with his typical indignation, claiming Democrats \u201chave stacked the deck against President Trump and the Republicans\u201d. \u201cThey have leaked out everything,\u201d Trump added in a morning tweet. The president appears to be downplaying the significance of today\u2019s hearing, given that transcripts from Taylor and Kent\u2019s interviews have already been released. But the hearing will give Americans the first chance to hear directly from these senior state department officials, which could shift public opinion of the inquiry. The question now is whether or not people will listen to them, with just a year left until the 2020 election.",

      "bodyText": "WhatsApp chats obtained by Guardian Australia between Australian federal police officers during recent raids on media outlets have revealed home affairs minister Peter Dutton\u2019s office asked the AFP for more information during the raid on News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst\u2019s apartment but were knocked back. Under freedom of information law, Guardian Australia sought copies of WhatsApp messages sent by or received by the deputy commissioner, Neil Gaughan, on the dates of the raids on the ABC and Smethurst\u2019s apartment in June. The raids were in response to government leaks. According to the documents released, assistant commissioner Debbie Platz messaged Gaughan on 4 June, the day of the Smethurst raids, to say she \u201chad Alex on [phone]\u201d. \u201cWanted more info. I said no so see how that goes,\u201d she said. It is understood Platz is referring to Alexander Dalgliesh, who is a senior advisor to Dutton and was acting chief of staff at the time of the raids. The messages strengthen the AFP\u2019s position that it has maintained its independence from government, but reveal the government attempting to get more information out of the AFP on the day of the raid. Dutton\u2019s office seeking more information, and being rejected by the AFP, came in the same week that Dutton said the AFP\u2019s independence from government was \u201cappropriate\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s been no interference from the government,\u201d he told 2GB\u2019s Ray Hadley. \u201cI don\u2019t get notified in the circumstance until the execution of search warrants is taking place, or shortly thereafter, and that\u2019s entirely appropriate because if the government\u2019s directing an investigation or who should be the subject of an execution of a search warrant, then obviously you\u2019d be condemned for that.\u201d Guardian Australia sought comment from the AFP and Dutton\u2019s office. In messages to then-commissioner Andrew Colvin, who was on leave at the time of the raids, Gaughan warned Colvin that his phone might start ringing after the AFP \u201centered the door of the journo\u201d. \u201cEveryone that needs to know knows,\u201d he said. \u201cGood man,\u201d Colvin responded. Several of the message logs have been fully or partially redacted. It also appears that an emoji may have been redacted from the log in response to one of Colvin\u2019s messages. Gaughan\u2019s previous text messages obtained under freedom of information included the use of a thumbs-up emoji in response to Dutton\u2019s chief of staff Craig Maclachlan suggesting \u201cthis arvo also fine\u201d when being informed about the October 2018 raid on the Department of Home Affairs to take place the next day. The use of this emoji has been brought up by MPs questioning the AFP over whether it was appropriate for Dutton\u2019s office to be informed about the raids ahead of the police raids over leaks related to the au pairs saga. The AFP has said that following criticism over the home affairs raid, policy had since changed and ministers are not informed ahead of raids. Gaughan also told Colvin in one message that during the raid, media had only just picked it up in the last hour and \u201cit will be interesting to see how much is said by News Corp\u201d. Smethurst is challenging the legality of the raid on her apartment in the high court this week, and has sought for the documents obtained by the AFP during the raid to be destroyed. The AFP has been investigating whether Smethurst and her source breached secrecy provisions by publishing part of a classified document revealing a proposal for the Australian Signals Directorate to gain new spying powers.",

      "body": "<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/16/moma-goes-global-with-an-explosive-450m-rehang\">$450m revamp</a> and relaunch of the Museum of Modern Art in New York has propelled the gallery\u2019s head to top spot in an annual contemporary art power list.</p> <p>Glenn Lowry has been named the world\u2019s most influential art figure in the 18th edition of the Power 100, produced annually by <a href=\"https://artreview.com/\">the magazine ArtReview</a>. In second place is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/goldin\">photographer Nan Goldin</a>, who has led protests against galleries taking money from the Mortimer and Raymond branches of the Sackler family. Banksy, meanwhile, appears on the list for the first time since 2008.</p> <p>JJ Charlesworth, a senior editor at ArtReview, said MoMA\u2019s extension and radical rethink of how it displayed its collection had led to the selection of Lowry. The gallery has often been criticised for being too focused on North American and European male artists. Charlesworth said the revamp had brought it more in line with a \u201cpluralist and global vision of contemporary art production and modern art history\u201d.</p> <p>The changes at MoMA are huge, although there is an element of it catching up with organisations such as the Tate which has already gone down a similar path. Tate\u2019s director, Maria Balshaw, is at number nine on the list, the highest-ranked Briton.</p> <p>The panel deciding on the list said MoMA, as the world\u2019s wealthiest museum, was now \u201cleading the way in offering a more global representation of art\u2019s histories and the diversity of artists working today and across the decades\u201d.</p> <p>Goldin is number two because of her campaign against museums and galleries taking money from some of the Sackler family, the owners of Purdue Pharma, one of the companies blamed for the US opioid drug crisis. The family members involved and the company deny any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The campaign prompted widespread debate about the ethics of philanthropy and resulted in galleries such as the National Portrait Gallery and Tate declining to take Sackler money. Charlesworth said Goldin\u2019s success showed that artists could be instrumental in change \u201crather than just protest on the sidelines\u201d.</p> <p>Banksy returns at number 14 after a year in which one of his paintings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/13/shredded-banksy-was-sothebys-in-on-the-act\">shredded itself</a> at a Sotheby\u2019s auction.

      "bodyText": "A $450m revamp and relaunch of the Museum of Modern Art in New York has propelled the gallery\u2019s head to top spot in an annual contemporary art power list. Glenn Lowry has been named the world\u2019s most influential art figure in the 18th edition of the Power 100, produced annually by the magazine ArtReview. In second place is the photographer Nan Goldin, who has led protests against galleries taking money from the Mortimer and Raymond branches of the Sackler family. Banksy, meanwhile, appears on the list for the first time since 2008. JJ Charlesworth, a senior editor at ArtReview, said MoMA\u2019s extension and radical rethink of how it displayed its collection had led to the selection of Lowry. The gallery has often been criticised for being too focused on North American and European male artists. Charlesworth said the revamp had brought it more in line with a \u201cpluralist and global vision of contemporary art production and modern art history\u201d. The changes at MoMA are huge, although there is an element of it catching up with organisations such as the Tate which has already gone down a similar path. Tate\u2019s director, Maria Balshaw, is at number nine on the list, the highest-ranked Briton. The panel deciding on the list said MoMA, as the world\u2019s wealthiest museum, was now \u201cleading the way in offering a more global representation of art\u2019s histories and the diversity of artists working today and across the decades\u201d. Goldin is number two because of her campaign against museums and galleries taking money from some of the Sackler family, the owners of Purdue Pharma, one of the companies blamed for the US opioid drug crisis. The family members involved and the company deny any wrongdoing. The campaign prompted widespread debate about the ethics of philanthropy and resulted in galleries such as the National Portrait Gallery and Tate declining to take Sackler money. Charlesworth said Goldin\u2019s success showed that artists could be instrumental in change \u201crather than just protest on the sidelines\u201d. Banksy returns at number 14 after a year in which one of his paintings shredded itself at a Sotheby\u2019s auction. In October his painting Devolved Parliament set a Banksy auction record when it sold for \u00a39.9m. Charlesworth said: \u201cBanksy has gone from being a street art celebrity to being someone who, increasingly, very shrewdly manipulates the spectacle of contemporary art.\u201d One of the most striking new entries in the list is an Indonesian art collective called ruangrupa, a group that emphasises the importance of research and collaboration in the creation and presentation of art. It has been chosen as the next artistic director of documenta in Kassel, Germany, an important contemporary art exhibition held once every five years. The list mixes some of the world\u2019s biggest commercial gallerists with artists who are uncomfortable with the power of the market. For example Hito Steyerl, a German artist and theorist who battles against the commodification of art, is at number four, sandwiched by the mega-gallerists Iwan and Manuela Wirth at three and David Zwirner at five. ArtReview said the list, compiled by a panel of 30 artists, curators and critics, \u201cremains a reflection of power as it is rather than as it should be\u201d.

The department store chain\u2019s festive campaign \u2013 which costs about \u00a37m a year \u2013 has become one of the media events of the year, generating millions of views on social media. Waitrose has also produced glossy ads in the past, but has not garnered the same kind of attention. The tearjerker, which harks back to previous ads featuring animated cuddly characters including Monty the penguin and Moz the monster, features a young girl, Ava, and a dragon who cannot stop himself spurting fire, disrupting Christmas fun by melting a snowman and a burning down a Christmas tree. The ad is fronted by a 10-year old actor, identified only as Ruby, who had to act alongside a stick or a plastic model in place of Edgar, which was created using CGI digital animation. It was filmed on a fairytale village set in Hungary. The story has a happy ending when Edgar uses his fiery breath to light the Christmas pudding for the village feast. As in previous years, a reworked pop classic provides the backing track \u2013 this time US soft rock group REO Speedwagon\u2019s 1980s power ballad Can\u2019t Fight This Feeling sung by Bastille frontman Dan Smith. By combining efforts for its two brands, the company is likely to have saved money at a time when profits are under pressure.

The report added: \u201cThe consequence of excessive rewards to shareholders is less money available for investment in long-term, organic growth, wages, R&amp;D, training and steps that would reduce environmental impact.\u201d Official figures show that employment has climbed to record highs in the years since the 2008 financial crash and unemployment has dropped to its lowest level since the 1970s. However, business investment has increased only modestly over the last 10 years and productivity growth, as measured by a worker\u2019s output per hour, has averaged less than 1% a year in that time compared with more than 2% a year in the 20 years before 2008. Wages increased strongly in 2019 to hit an annual growth rate of 4%, but the rise is expected to be short lived and in September annual increases in wages had already fallen back to 3.6%. Figures from the data provider Link Asset Services earlier this year showed that dividends paid to holders of all UK shares jumped almost 16% to a record high in the first three months of the year, putting investors on track for \u00a3100bn in payouts this year.",

In ordinary circumstances there would be a hostile atmosphere for a visiting nation with an outside chance of preventing Turkey from qualifying for only their third major tournament finals since 2002. However, on the eve of the qualifier in Iceland last June, Turkey players were held for almost four hours at Keflav\u00edk airport, where they were subject to bag searches that they felt were unnecessary.

The Netherlands <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/10/netherlands-northern-ireland-euro-2020-qualifier-match-report\">ultimately prevailed 3-1</a> and their manager, Ronald Koeman, afterwards described Northern Ireland\u2019s counterattacking approach as \u201cterrible to watch\u201d.

Several newcomers were called into the squad for the start of the latest qualification campaign but one of the most exciting, 20-year-old Valladollid centre-back Mohammed Salisu, is out injured. At least there is still the possibility of Torric Jebrin, who has been outstanding for TP Mazembe this season, featuring in midfield. This is the first competitive match for South Africa\u2019s manager, Molefi Ntseki, since his appointment in August and a win away to their main rivals in the group would amount to the perfect start for him at least. <strong>PD</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <em><strong>Ghana v South Africa, 7pm Thursday</strong></em></p> <h2>6) Can Parrott climb Irish pecking order in time for Denmark?</h2> <p>What\u2019s worse than a meaningless friendly? A counterproductive friendly! So hats off to the Football Association of Ireland for arranging to play New Zealand on Thursday four days before their critical Euro 2020 showdown with Denmark. Unless Mick McCarthy loses his sense of reason, he will not play any players on Thursday that he plans to start on Monday. Granted, there is the possibility that 17-year-old Troy Parrott will do so well on his senior international debut that McCarthy will throw him into the starting line-up for Monday, especially with Aaron Connolly missing that match through injury. But given that McCarthy could not bring himself to start Connolly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/12/republic-of-ireland-georgia-euro-2020-qualifying-match-report\">against Georgia</a> a week after he had scored twice for Brighton against Tottenham, the best Parrott can realistically hope for is a prominent place on the bench for the Denmark game. That would still leave scope for the prodigy to make a heroic late contribution for Ireland, who must beat Denmark to qualify automatically for the finals. <strong>PD</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <em><strong>Republic of Ireland v New Zealand, 7.45pm Thursday</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5533f2553f5bb39352f05045e6ded32acf7ca341\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5533f2553f5bb39352f05045e6ded32acf7ca341/550_101_3581_2149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Troy Parrott chats to Republic of Ireland assistant coach Robbie Keane during a training session on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Troy Parrott chats to Republic of Ireland assistant coach Robbie Keane during a training session on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7) Pukki to fire Finland into first major finals?</h2> <p>Teemu Pukki has not scored for Norwich in the Premier League since 14 September but the striker has been a consistent menace with Finland. His two goals in the 3-0 win against their nearest challengers, Armenia, in their last international game took the nation to within touching distance of their first ever major finals. With the Group J whipping boys Liechtenstein up next in Helsinki, a win would guarantee them a place at next summer\u2019s tournament. Expect Pukki, who has scored seven in eight qualifiers, to be the man who sparks the party. Perhaps then he could bring some of his international sheen back to Norwich with him. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Finland v Liechtenstein</strong></em><em><strong>, 5pm Friday</strong></em></p> <h2>8) Six and Guinea look to Ke\u00efta for hope</h2> <p>Claudio Ranieri knows that \u201cunderwhelming\u201d appointments can sometimes work out very well but fans of Guinea, having been teased by reports linking the country with the Italian, remain less than enthused by the hiring of Didier Six. His first match with Guinea last month was an embarrassment, a 1-0 friendly defeat to Comoros followed by a slightly better 3-2 defeat to Chile. Guinea will have to improve much more for Six\u2019s daunting first competitive game, away to Mali on Thursday. As if that assignment were not difficult enough, injury has deprived Guinea of key players, including the Roma midfielder Amadou Diawara, captain Ibrahima Traor\u00e9, and defender Florentin Pogba. All of which means even more hope than usual will be invested in Naby Ke\u00efta, who missed his side\u2019s two matches last month. <strong>PD</strong></p> <p>\u2022<em><strong> Mali v Guinea, 7pm Thursday</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) Hagi leads out Romania to vanquish ghosts of 1994</h2> <p>For those seeking a denouement awash with permutations, look no further than Euro 2020 Group F. Spain are home and hosed, Sweden are second while Romania sit a point behind them and Norway four in arrears. The Norwegians are still in the mix given that their remaining matches are at home to the Faroe Islands and away to Malta, but the far greater likelihood is that Romania v Sweden in Bucharest will ultimately decide qualification. It is do or die for the hosts, who essentially need to win and then hope Spain are in charitable mood in Madrid three days later \u2013 given Sweden face the Faroes that day. This will only be the fourth time these two nations have met since the 1994 World Cup, when Sweden won a magnificently dramatic quarter-final on penalties. Neither present-day side can hold a candle to those of 25 years ago, but both are improving and Romania can look to a particularly talented group of young players spearheaded by Ianis Hagi. Realistically there is hardly anything to choose between any of the three contenders \u2013 nerves will be jangling throughout the weekend. <strong>NA</strong></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Romania v Sweden, 7.45pm Friday</strong></em></p> <h2>10) Iraq forced to play abroad once more against old foes Iran</h2> <p>Until last week it seemed that Iraq might host Iran on their own soil for the first time since 2001. They were to face their bitter rivals in Basra, just weeks after hosting Hong Kong there in the first competitive international to be hosted in the country for eight years, but the political situation there has deteriorated this autumn, so Fifa decreed that the match must be held elsewhere. The stakes on Thursday in Amman could not be much higher. Iraq, coached by Srecko Katanec, sit atop Group C in the third round of Asia\u2019s labyrinthine World Cup qualifying tournament and three points would put them four points clear of Marc Wilmots\u2019s Iran at the halfway stage. Iraq still have a way to go before they can dream of a first finals appearance since 1986, especially given the hurdles that are continually placed in their path, but a win in the Jordanian capital would be a significant statement. <strong>NA</strong></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Iraq v Iran, Thursday 2pm</strong></em></p>",

So hats off to the Football Association of Ireland for arranging to play New Zealand on Thursday four days before their critical Euro 2020 showdown with Denmark. Unless Mick McCarthy loses his sense of reason, he will not play any players on Thursday that he plans to start on Monday. Granted, there is the possibility that 17-year-old Troy Parrott will do so well on his senior international debut that McCarthy will throw him into the starting line-up for Monday, especially with Aaron Connolly missing that match through injury. But given that McCarthy could not bring himself to start Connolly against Georgia a week after he had scored twice for Brighton against Tottenham, the best Parrott can realistically hope for is a prominent place on the bench for the Denmark game. That would still leave scope for the prodigy to make a heroic late contribution for Ireland, who must beat Denmark to qualify automatically for the finals. PD \u2022 Republic of Ireland v New Zealand, 7.45pm Thursday 7) Pukki to fire Finland into first major finals? Teemu Pukki has not scored for Norwich in the Premier League since 14 September but the striker has been a consistent menace with Finland. His two goals in the 3-0 win against their nearest challengers, Armenia, in their last international game took the nation to within touching distance of their first ever major finals. With the Group J whipping boys Liechtenstein up next in Helsinki, a win would guarantee them a place at next summer\u2019s tournament. Expect Pukki, who has scored seven in eight qualifiers, to be the man who sparks the party. Perhaps then he could bring some of his international sheen back to Norwich with him. GB \u2022 Finland v Liechtenstein, 5pm Friday 8) Six and Guinea look to Ke\u00efta for hope Claudio Ranieri knows that \u201cunderwhelming\u201d appointments can sometimes work out very well but fans of Guinea, having been teased by reports linking the country with the Italian, remain less than enthused by the hiring of Didier Six. His first match with Guinea last month was an embarrassment, a 1-0 friendly defeat to Comoros followed by a slightly better 3-2 defeat to Chile. Guinea will have to improve much more for Six\u2019s daunting first competitive game, away to Mali on Thursday. As if that assignment were not difficult enough, injury has deprived Guinea of key players, including the Roma midfielder Amadou Diawara, captain Ibrahima Traor\u00e9, and defender Florentin Pogba. All of which means even more hope than usual will be invested in Naby Ke\u00efta, who missed his side\u2019s two matches last month. PD \u2022 Mali v Guinea, 7pm Thursday 9) Hagi leads out Romania to vanquish ghosts of 1994 For those seeking a denouement awash with permutations, look no further than Euro 2020 Group F. Spain are home and hosed, Sweden are second while Romania sit a point behind them and Norway four in arrears. The Norwegians are still in the mix given that their remaining matches are at home to the Faroe Islands and away to Malta, but the far greater likelihood is that Romania v Sweden in Bucharest will ultimately decide qualification. It is do or die for the hosts, who essentially need to win and then hope Spain are in charitable mood in Madrid three days later \u2013 given Sweden face the Faroes that day. This will only be the fourth time these two nations have met since the 1994 World Cup, when Sweden won a magnificently dramatic quarter-final on penalties. Neither present-day side can hold a candle to those of 25 years ago, but both are improving and Romania can look to a particularly talented group of young players spearheaded by Ianis Hagi. Realistically there is hardly anything to choose between any of the three contenders \u2013 nerves will be jangling throughout the weekend. NA \u2022 Romania v Sweden, 7.45pm Friday 10) Iraq forced to play abroad once more against old foes Iran Until last week it seemed that Iraq might host Iran on their own soil for the first time since 2001. They were to face their bitter rivals in Basra, just weeks after hosting Hong Kong there in the first competitive international to be hosted in the country for eight years, but the political situation there has deteriorated this autumn, so Fifa decreed that the match must be held elsewhere. The stakes on Thursday in Amman could not be much higher. Iraq, coached by Srecko Katanec, sit atop Group C in the third round of Asia\u2019s labyrinthine World Cup qualifying tournament and three points would put them four points clear of Marc Wilmots\u2019s Iran at the halfway stage. Iraq still have a way to go before they can dream of a first finals appearance since 1986, especially given the hurdles that are continually placed in their path, but a win in the Jordanian capital would be a significant statement.
