He praised Long-Bailey\u2019s \u201cbrains and brilliance\u201d and said he blamed Labour\u2019s election defeat \u201cvirtually solely\u201d on the party backing a second referendum on Brexit. Asked about council leaders quoted in a Guardian article who said Long-Bailey was a \u201ccontinuity Corbyn\u201d candidate, McCluskey said there were \u201clots of these leaders who are anti-Corbyn, so of course they\u2019ll try to stick Rebecca with the same tags and that\u2019s deeply unfair of them.\u201d He said it was Brexit that had dented Labour\u2019s popularity, not the leader, as Corbyn had been \u201cloved\u201d two years ago. McCluskey also claimed there was no doubt that Corbyn\u2019s opponents \u201cused the antisemitism issue\u201d to undermine him, prompting criticism from some Labour MPs that he was failing to accept the depth of the problem. He said he agreed that Labour had \u201cnever handled the antisemitism issue correctly\u201d, and he said he had no problem with acknowledging that \u201clots of people were genuinely concerned\u201d. However, he said there were \u201cothers who were disingenous\u201d and had acted in a \u201cdespicable\u201d way to undermine Corbyn\u2019s leadership. McCluskey defended Richard Burgon and Dawn Butler, two deputy leadership candidates, over their refusal to sign up to a 10-point plan to tackle antisemitism published by the Board of Deputies of British Jews. The party is preparing to receive the conclusions of an Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation into its handling of antisemitism early this year. Two Labour MPs, Catherine McKinnell and Wes Streeting, expressed disapproval at McCluskey\u2019s assessment of the situation. Streeting said: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced that those who dismissed antisemitism concerns as \u2018mood music\u2019 and sought to downplay, dismiss and delegitimatise concerns are part of the problem, not those of us who\u2019ve consistently challenged antisemitism.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "About 100 schoolchildren are among the Australian citizens that are stranded in Wuhan, which has been placed into lockdown by the Chinese government to contain the deadly coronavirus outbreak. As authorities brace for what is expected to be a fifth confirmed case in Australia on Monday, the health minister, Greg Hunt, said the government was working to repatriate Australian citizens who are now trapped in the Chinese megacity of 11 million people. \u201cWe know at this point that the Chinese authorities have closed the Wuhan city as well as other cities within Hubei province,\u201d Hunt told ABC Radio on Monday morning. \u201cWe are working to make sure that there is support for those Australians and we are also working on, as are other countries, trying to secure their ability to return to Australia. At this point in time, the foreign minister is working around the clock on that.\u201d More than 50 people have died from this new coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan and causes pneumonia, while Hunt said on Monday morning there were 2,019 confirmed cases around the world. Chinese authorities last week took the dramatic step of imposing a mass ban on travel outside of the city in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. It has since expanded the ban to 10 cities. France and the United States are among nations that have announced plans to charter a plane to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan. Asked if Australia would to the same, Hunt said the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, was working with Chinese authorities \u201con all options to secure of the Australians\u201d. \u201cThese are international discussions that many countries are having.\u201d It comes as authorities in Australia are expected to confirm a fifth confirmed case of the coronavirus. Three people in New South Wales and one in Victoria have already been diagnosed with the virus, while the fifth person had preliminarily tested positive to the virus and would undergo further examination on Monday. \u201cThere are four confirmed cases and one \u2018highly probable\u2019,\u201d Hunt told ABC Radio. \u201cThat\u2019s subject to confirmation. We should receive the results from the second round of testing today.\u201d Hunt said it was likely there would be more confirmed cases, but he would not be drawn on how many more people were likely to test positive for the virus. \u201cThe advice from the chief medical officer is we suspect there could well be other cases in Australia,\u201d he said. The World Health Organisation is yet to declare to a public health emergency, but the virus has prompted massive disruption in China, where events have been cancelled during the lunar year festival. The Asian Football Confederation has also moved games away from Nanjing, meaning Sydney will now host the Matildas\u2019 Olympic qualifying group matches against China, Taiwan and Thailand. In Sydney, three men aged 35, 43, and 53 are being treated in hospital but are listed as being stable. Authorities have now spoken to all but two people who have been in close contact with the three men since they arrived from China. In Victoria, a man in his 50s is being treated at Monash Medical Centre while four of his family members are being quarantined at home. A further 11 patients are now awaiting test results. Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said authorities were attempting to contact four people who may have come into contact with the Victorian patient after sharing the same flight.

Alternatively, does he take more of a gamble and include Saracens\u2019 highly promising young back-rower Ben Earl alongside Curry and Sam Underhill? Or does he go another way and keep faith with Northampton\u2019s Lewis Ludlam, whose positive attitude impressed everyone at last autumn\u2019s World Cup?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/25/eddie-jones-england-togetherness-six-nations\">Eddie Jones: \u2018When England show togetherness we are powerful\u2019 </a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a sizeable call in every sense: France will be pumped up, led by a new captain in the shape of their classy flanker Charles Ollivon. Shrinking Anglo-Saxon violets need not apply. England, in particular, need a ball-carrier to replicate some of the hard yards that Vunipola makes, as well as someone capable of boxing clever in a potentially tight corner.</p> <p>With assorted other in-form options \u2013 Exeter\u2019s Sam Simmonds and Harlequins\u2019 Alex Dombrandt \u2013 studiously ignored by Jones, it will be fascinating, and instructive, to see who does get the nod to replace Vunipola for a game which could shape England\u2019s entire championship. If it happens to be Ludlam, who has never started a Test at No 8, it will be further reward for one of the more enthusiastic characters in the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a58952d51c530c56cbe4a8208895819745b25337\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a58952d51c530c56cbe4a8208895819745b25337/0_114_2866_1720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Ludlam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lewis Ludlam in action against Benetton in the Champions Cup for Northampton, for whom he has impressed this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel French/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 24, Ludlam\u2019s career has been a far from steady upward graph and even at Northampton this season his rampaging teammate Teimana Harrison has been more eye-catching. When it comes to desire, however, few can beat the committed Saint, who deliberately kept his unpacked World Cup kit bag on the floor in full view at home since his return from Japan to remind himself how much he wanted to continue representing his country. \u201cIt was just as a reminder \u2013 when I wake up in the morning, when I go to training, when I come back in the evening \u2013 that all my choices are geared towards playing for England.</p> <p>\u201cJust seeing my bag there was a little reminder of a goal and of something I wanted to achieve. Now it is about pushing on and hopefully playing a little bit more than I did at the World Cup. From speaking to the coaches, they told me I had a choice whether I wanted to be a player who made a few appearances at one World Cup or wanted to really push on.

      "bodyText": "The Six Nations is fast approaching and, for someone, so is a massive opportunity. With the unfortunate Billy Vunipola out of contention following his latest broken arm, there is a big hole in England\u2019s back row to face France in Paris on Sunday and Eddie Jones now faces a slightly tricky decision. Does he simply shunt the energetic Tom Curry across from the blindside and redeploy, say, Maro Itoje or Courtney Lawes at six? Alternatively, does he take more of a gamble and include Saracens\u2019 highly promising young back-rower Ben Earl alongside Curry and Sam Underhill? Or does he go another way and keep faith with Northampton\u2019s Lewis Ludlam, whose positive attitude impressed everyone at last autumn\u2019s World Cup? It is a sizeable call in every sense: France will be pumped up, led by a new captain in the shape of their classy flanker Charles Ollivon. Shrinking Anglo-Saxon violets need not apply. England, in particular, need a ball-carrier to replicate some of the hard yards that Vunipola makes, as well as someone capable of boxing clever in a potentially tight corner. With assorted other in-form options \u2013 Exeter\u2019s Sam Simmonds and Harlequins\u2019 Alex Dombrandt \u2013 studiously ignored by Jones, it will be fascinating, and instructive, to see who does get the nod to replace Vunipola for a game which could shape England\u2019s entire championship. If it happens to be Ludlam, who has never started a Test at No 8, it will be further reward for one of the more enthusiastic characters in the country. At 24, Ludlam\u2019s career has been a far from steady upward graph and even at Northampton this season his rampaging teammate Teimana Harrison has been more eye-catching. When it comes to desire, however, few can beat the committed Saint, who deliberately kept his unpacked World Cup kit bag on the floor in full view at home since his return from Japan to remind himself how much he wanted to continue representing his country. \u201cIt was just as a reminder \u2013 when I wake up in the morning, when I go to training, when I come back in the evening \u2013 that all my choices are geared towards playing for England. \u201cJust seeing my bag there was a little reminder of a goal and of something I wanted to achieve. Now it is about pushing on and hopefully playing a little bit more than I did at the World Cup. From speaking to the coaches, they told me I had a choice whether I wanted to be a player who made a few appearances at one World Cup or wanted to really push on. To have that constant reminder there really helped to steer me in the right direction again.\u201d The only slight flaw in this psychological masterplan became evident when he finally opened up his bag to prepare to head out to England\u2019s current training camp in Portugal. \u201cIn all honesty, it was a bit musty. Luckily they clean your kit as soon as you get out here so it was all straight in the wash bag and ready to go.\u201d Even the merest glimpse of his World Cup kit, though, still prompts a brief surge of pride. \u201cIt was a moment because I had all my World Cup shirts and my medal in there. To open that back up and remind me of where I had come from at the World Cup \u2026 was a boost for my confidence and brought back some memories as well.\u201d Ludlam was involved in four games in Japan but started only once, against the USA in Kobe, a game in which he also registered his first Test try.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>So far there are around 40 cases outside China, including three each in the United States and France. All 56 deaths have occurred in China, mostly in people who were older and had underlying health problems that made it hard to fight off the virus.</p> \n<p>The Department of Health and Social Care said on Sunday that 52 people had been cleared after testing in the UK and the \u201crisk to the public remains low\u201d.</p> \n<p>But in spite of the rigorous containment measures China has taken, its ban on flights and the UK checks on travellers from China at Heathrow, experts say it is only a matter of time until there is a case in the UK, given the ease with which the new coronavirus is now believed to pass from one person to another \u2013 possibly transmitted by people with mild or even no symptoms at all.</p> \n<p>Ferguson, whose team have been modelling the disease for the World Health Organization, said they estimated the virus had a reproductive rate of 2.5-3, meaning that each person infected would potentially transmit it to up to three others.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy best guess now is perhaps 100,000 cases right now,\u201d he said, although it could be between 30,000 and 200,000. \u201cAlmost certainly many tens of thousands of people are infected.\u201d</p> \n<p>Most of the cases that have been exported to other countries from China have been mild, he said.

The 22-year-old, who operates off the left flank but can play as a No 10, has travelled to London to finalise his personal terms and undertake a medical. PSV, however, are furious, claiming that they do not have an agreement with Spurs over the fee. The Dutch club value him at more than \u200e\u20ac30m. They had forbidden Bergwijn from going to London only for him to travel regardless. Earlier in the day, Bergwijn had called the PSV interim manager, Ernest Faber, to tell him that he did not want to be selected for the home game against FC Twente, which ended in a 1-1 draw.

It\u2019s early days, of course, but Liverpool\u2019s relentlessness is such that you could understand a rising anxiety at Old Trafford about the prospect of their Class of \u201899 finally being equalled, or similar feelings in north London regarding their fabled Invincibles. To do both at once \u2013 a supremely distant possibility, but a possibility nonetheless \u2013 well, that would leave both those history-makers in the dust.</p> <p><strong>But first things first</strong>. Shrewsbury may be 59 places below J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s men but they\u2019ve proven a tough nut to crack in this competition in recent seasons, taking Wolves to a replay last year and West Ham the year before that. And when Liverpool take to the field at New Meadow this afternoon, they will be up against a side they have lost just one of their last 17 FA Cup fixtures on home turf. </p> <p><strong>A nice subplot</strong> here is that the match is of special interest to a tiny sunkissed island 4,000 miles away: Shrewsbury\u2019s trio of Aaron Pierre, Omar Beckles and Oliver Norburn all represent the national team of Grenada (population 111,000 \u2013 or 1/14th of the county of Merseyside) with another prospective international, Ro-Shaun Williams, yet to commit. So plenty will be tuning in from the Caribbean to see how the world champions fare against Shrewsbury\u2019s Spice Boys, as the Grenadian team is affectionately known.</p> <p><strong>For Liverpool, that tag has rather different connotations</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/oct/22/manchester-united-liverpool-class-of-92-spice-boys-eric-cantona\">of lenient management, lax defending and chronic underachievement</a>. That was also an era which saw the only other meeting between these clubs, a 4-0 win for Liverpool at Gay Meadow en route to the Spice Boys\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jul/24/golden-goal-eric-cantona-for-manchester-united-v-liverpool-1996\">most ignominious hour</a>. We\u2019re a long way from all that now, though, and while another Wembley final is still some way off, should Liverpool get there this year we can be sure of one thing: they won\u2019t be a cream suit in sight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0179f76a4e11f0cc82eef45821763a5159df3d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0179f76a4e11f0cc82eef45821763a5159df3d9/0_77_3010_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robbie Fowler, Steve MacManaman and Jamie Redknapp drink in the occasion at Wembley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robbie Fowler, Steve MacManaman and Jamie Redknapp drink in the occasion at Wembley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-26T16:27:44.263Z\">at 4.27pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our match report from New Meadow. And that\u2019s all from me \u2013 thanks for reading! Jurgen Klopp: \u201cWe gave so many invitations to the opponent \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to win a game like that. We don\u2019t have enough time to say all the things which were not right today. We scored a really wonderful goal to be honest, but apart from that we gave them a lot in the first half. Adrian was brilliant. We got a big present after half time \u2013 2-0 \u2013 but it didn\u2019t look like 2-0 on the pitch, to be honest.\u201d Here\u2019s Josh Laurent: \u201cIt shows our character. But before the game we believed we could win it, never mind draw it. We\u2019ve got great belief in that dressing room \u2013 the pressure was on them, not us. At half-time, the gaffer just told us to believe. He said we\u2019d get chances and he was right. I can\u2019t wait for the replay, unbelievable. It\u2019s something everyone dreams of.\u201d The final whistle is cue for a buoyant pitch invasion, and why not? The home fans have seen an exemplary show of character from their team and, shapeless as Liverpool were, the hosts attacked with courage and purpose. Had they nicked it at the end, no one could have had any complaints. Instead they\u2019ll be rewarded with a trip to Anfield \u2013 and who knows how that one will turn out if they play like this again. Liverpool charge up the other end but Jones takes too long and his shot is blocked. And \u2013 peep peep \u2013 that\u2019s that: Shrewsbury go back to Anfield after a quite heroic comeback. A sensational second half. 93 mins: Liverpool finish strongly, Lamouci on the attack down the left and Lovren swinging one in towards Origi, who can\u2019t quite meet it cleanly. Then Shrewsbury break and Laurent, running down the right, hits a ludicrously audacious effort, trying to beat Adrian at his near post. The Spaniard reacts in time to tip wide. And the corner is a good one, but headed over. This is some game. 91 mins: Firmino \u2013 who has done more in two minutes than any of his teammates in 90 \u2013 runs free again, finding space on the left and picking out Salah right in front of goal, but the Egyptian\u2019s glancing header doesn\u2019t have enough on it and flashes wide of the far post. Golden chance! 89 mins: Firmino escapes into the six-yard box and nudges a shot past the keeper, but there\u2019s no power in it and the ball bounces tantalisingly across the face of goal where Jones and Williams both hurl themselves at it! The defender just gets there first and diverts it away from goal. 87 mins: Chaos in the Liverpool box. Love sends in a cross that bounces up and hits Fabinho on the hand! But the ref gives nothing \u2026 and there\u2019s no VAR to quibble with him. Udoh has come on for Whalley. Klopp\u2019s men are clinging on. 85 mins: On trots the Brazilian, replacing Minamino. 83 mins: Shrewsbury have all the momentum here and look dangerous every time they go forward. This time Cummings looks to engineer a shot on the edge of the box with the Liverpool defence in full-on panic mode, but can\u2019t quite get his effort away. Only one team looks like winning this. Roberto Firmino is readying himself on the touchline. Important input from Sean Clayton: \u201cNo discussion of footballer derrierres would be complete without a mention of Razor \u2018Neil\u2019 Ruddock. The steatopygnous king of the shorts-ripping shimmy.\u201d 80 mins: Salah\u2019s first act is to intercept a cross from Love and pick out a red shirt with ease. The problem is that the shirt in question belongs to Matip, who is making his way along the far touchline having been brought off. 79 mins: The ultimate sign of respect from Klopp as Mo Salah is sent on to sort things out. Joel Matip comes off. 77 mins: Origi \u2013 who blammed a 25-yarder just wide seconds before the equaliser \u2013 latches on to a clever ball from Minamino and rattles a strike into the side netting. They\u2019ve done it! And it\u2019s a route-one classic, a skyward hoof from the keeper flicked on by Whalley and into the path of Cummings, whose low strike squirms underneath Adrian and into the net. Two-two! 74 mins: Minamino has been quietly impressive here, and as Liverpool relieve the pressure with a bit of keep-ball he is central to much of it, buzzing around with purpose at the heart of the visitors\u2019 attack. 71 mins: Liverpool look to reassert their authority. Minamino scurries forward but can\u2019t find an opening, before Lovren picks the ball up and looks again for the new recruit but the pass is overhit. Klopp shuffles his pack: Oxlade-Chamberlain for Elliott. 69 mins: The home side show no sign of letting up, turning the screw with another attack down the right, which ends when Love\u2019s cross is blocked by Matip at full stretch. 67 mins: Shrewsbury deserve that, and based on the last hour of football it wouldn\u2019t be the greatest surprise if they get another. Origi loses his marker and finds Minamino, who is crowded out in the box. Cummings steps up and sends Adrian the wrong way, firing left-footed into the bottom left corner. Game on! Laurent hares clear from midfield. Larouci is tracking the midfielder but can only succeed in tripping him. The contact is right on the edge of the box \u2026 but there\u2019s no VAR and the ref has given the penalty. 63 mins: Love digs out a great cross from the right, and it\u2019s well met by Edwards but his header flies just over. Shrewsbury should not be 2-0 down here. 61 mins: That\u2019s Lang\u2019s last contribution - he comes off for Cummings. Then a hideous mistake from Matip, who under no pressure passes the ball directly to Laurent. The striker has a clear sight of goal from 15 yards but screws badly wide. 58 mins: Adrian to the rescue again! And this is the best chance of the lot for the hosts, who again spring a lax offside trap, Lang striding clear down the inside right after being picked out by Goss. He closes in on goal and his shot is low, hard and across the keeper, but the Spaniard is down in a flash to fingertip the ball wide. 57 mins: It doesn\u2019t get any easier for Shrewsbury: Naby Keita is warming up for Liverpool. Larouci has enjoyed a bit more of the ball in this half but has so far lacked the end product of his right-sided counterpart. 55 mins: Shrewsbury have come out of their shell and mount some sustained pressure \u2013 though with Liverpool sat a bit deeper now there are no obvious opening for the hosts, whose possession comes to nothing. 52 mins: That second goal hasn\u2019t made Liverpool\u2019s defence look any less shaky. Lovren sells Matip short and Adrian has to intervene and hack clear. More correspondence from Simon McMahon: \u201cSome of the greatest players of all time have had the bum cakes to match. Kenny, of course. And off the top of my head, there was also Pele, Maradona, Gazza and Micky Quinn to name just a few.\u201d I\u2019d humbly suggest Ramon Vega, Wilfried Bony and Eden Hazard. Any more for any more? 39 mins. You don\u2019t want to be mean. You really don\u2019t. But that\u2019s one of the most absurd own-goals you\u2019ll ever see. Williams bends in another of those trademark crosses to the back post and it\u2019s met by an expert attacker who\u2019s found all sorts of space and volleys the ball ruthlessly into the bottom corner. But wait! That\u2019s not an attacker, it\u2019s Shrewsbury right-back Donald Love! Oh dear me. Two-Nil. And we\u2019re back. Liverpool get us back under way, and there\u2019s an early wrestling match between Origi and Williams. Matt Dony writes: \u201cAh, Derek Smalls. Great shout, McMahon. Of course, that calls to mind the classic track Big Bottom, which in turn brings us back to King Kenny and Liverpool.\u201d Some half-time reading for the Francophiles among you: And that\u2019s the last act of the half. Liverpool began with supreme dominance but the League One side have come back into this game and should be level. As good as Liverpool\u2019s second string might be, they do give up chances. You feel that there\u2019ll be one or two more for the hosts before the day is out. 45 mins: Shrewsbury win a corner with some insistent harrying, and Whalley\u2019s ball in misses everyone and is eventually cleared. The hosts lump it back into the box, where Pierre is waiting and inexplicably unmarked \u2026 but he can\u2019t quite get the bouncing ball under his control. \u201cGood evening Alex,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to watch Shrewsbury and not think of Derek Smalls, bass player with legendary rockers Spinal Tap. The lukewarm water to the fire and ice of Tufnel and St. Hubbins.\u201d Well indeed. And so far Whalley\u2019s finishing has illustrated that fine line between stupid and clever. 40 mins: And again! Williams fails to deal with a bouncing ball and Lang picks out his mate \u2013 yep, Whalley again \u2013 who is through on goal, albeit at a bit of an angle. But his left-foot shot is ever so slightly scuffed, and rolls wide of the far post. This game should be 1-1. 37 mins: Shrewsbury are getting pretty good at this: again Lang and Whalley spring a full-throttle two-man attack, ending with the latter picking his way into the box only to be dispossessed by a prone Fabinho. He should have done better, really. But the hosts are showing some danger. 33 mins: Liverpool have found their rhythm. A snappy passing move in midfield \u2013 Williams to Chirivella to Elliott \u2013 comes to nothing but draws cheers from the travelling contingent. Then Whalley finds himself scampering clear again after flicking the ball over Matip\u2019s head, but Adrian comes to the rescue once more, haring off his line to nip the danger in the bud. 30 mins: Williams picks up the ball in acres of space, gets it stuck under his feet, and falls over in slapstick style. Don\u2019t believe the hype. 29 mins: Williams is seeing plenty of the ball down Liverpool\u2019s right. He\u2019s a composed passer, too, and his latest contribution is an early cross to earn a corner \u2026 which comes to nowt. 27 mins: Change for the hosts as Edwards comes on for captain Norburn, who is injured and looks distraught to be coming off. 23 mins: Glorious chance for Whalley! From nothing, Lang wins a loose ball in midfield and slips in the striker, who sprints clear of a misjudged offside trap and finds himself clean through. He takes the shot right-footed and low, but Adrian has stood tall and spread himself, and makes the save with his feet. That\u2019s terrific goalkeeping. But my word, Whalley will be rueing that. 20 mins: Jones slices wildly at the ball from the edge of the box \u2013 miles wide. Don\u2019t believe the hype. 19 mins: Lang tries to escape down the inside right channel but Jones matches him stride for stride and claims possession with minimal fuss. He looks some player. Liverpool made that look painfully simple. In a way, it was \u2013 there\u2019s was no frills to any of it \u2013 but the buildup play from Minamino, dropping deep to collect the ball and lay it off, and Chirivella, who wasted no time in playing the killer pass, was first-rate. Curtis Jones breaks the deadlock, galloping forward from midfield and slotting coolly under O\u2019Leary after being picked out by a splendid first-time pass from Chirivella. 14 mins: Lovren spots Elliott haring forward and looks to pick the winger out with a long lofted ball. But O\u2019Leary leaps to pluck the pass out of the sky. Nice. Then Williams finds some space on the right and puts in a wonderful \u2013 perhaps even Trentesque \u2013 cross, which just evades a queue of attackers. 11 mins: The game has settled into something of a pattern, with Shrewsbury\u2019s players all behind the ball and Liverpool monopolising possession. They\u2019ve lacked zip so far, though, Elliott the latest to misplace a simple pass. 9 mins: Good feet from Laurent, who pirouettes away from two markers in the centre circle, but his side are so deep and don\u2019t have a focal point up front, so his ball forward goes to no one. Liverpool counter and Origi rifles an early sighter just wide. 5 mins: Minamino has seen plenty of the ball so far and looks a livewire, always on the move. He\u2019s playing in the Firmino role of free-roaming centre-forward, constantly dropping deep to link up. 4 mins: Liverpool put together some purposeful early pressure, Minamino twice dispossessed while prowling in the box and Chirivella surging forward with intent. 2 mins: Whalley makes a good run and is picked out well by Golbourne. For a second it looks as though he might just be in \u2026 but the flag is up. The hosts get going and quickly lump a high ball forward to test Larouci. Dejan Lovren\u2019s in a good mood \u2013 Liverpool\u2019s captain for the day grins and giggles as he calls the toss. And it\u2019s Shrewsbury to kick off. The teams file on to the pitch from a pokey passage \u2013 no tunnel club here \u2013 and exchange handshakes. Jurgen Klopp speaks briefly to the BBC and comes pretty close to a full house in cup-tie-against-an-underdog bingo: a \u201ctough pitch\u201d, a \u201cbig fight\u201d, fixture congestion and hungry youngsters all get a mention. German efficiency, there. Meanwhile, in the Women\u2019s FA Cup, Arsenal have gone to West Ham and come away with a thumping win. Report here: Early evidence suggests Harvey Elliott hasn\u2019t changed his haircut, which is a shame. Helluva talent though \u2013 and ferociously direct. Golbourne will have his work cut out at left wing-back. After some pre-match reading? You\u2019re in luck. Our man in the north-west sat down for a lovely chat with Shrewsbury\u2019s Grenadian contingent. Have a gander: Just the 11 changes for Mr Klopp, then, although that rather underplays the strength of a side that contains two seasoned centre-halves, one thrilling new arrival, perhaps the Premier League\u2019s best all-round midfielder, and at least two spectacularly promising teenage prodigies. As for Sam Ricketts, his wing-back Scott Golbourne has passed a late fitness test to make it into the XI and Blackburn loanee Sam Hart is on the bench ahead of a potential debut. Shrewsbury: O\u2019Leary; Pierre, Ebanks-Landell, Williams, Love; Norburn, Laurent, Golbourne, Whalley; Goss, Lang. Subs: Murphy, Edwards, Beckles, Walker, Udoh, Cummings, Hart. Liverpool: Adrian, Williams, Matip, Lovren, Larouci, Fabinho, Chirivella, Jones, Minamino, Elliott, Origi. Subs: Kelleher, Keita, Firmino, Salah, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Hoever, Alexander-Arnold. They couldn\u2019t, could they\u2026? As the weeks tick by and the wins stack up, the vital question hanging over Liverpool\u2019s season is becoming less about whether they can finally get their hands on That Trophy, and more about exactly which trophies they won\u2019t get their hands on. It\u2019s early days, of course, but Liverpool\u2019s relentlessness is such that you could understand a rising anxiety at Old Trafford about the prospect of their Class of \u201899 finally being equalled, or similar feelings in north London regarding their fabled Invincibles. To do both at once \u2013 a supremely distant possibility, but a possibility nonetheless \u2013 well, that would leave both those history-makers in the dust. But first things first. Shrewsbury may be 59 places below J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s men but they\u2019ve proven a tough nut to crack in this competition in recent seasons, taking Wolves to a replay last year and West Ham the year before that. And when Liverpool take to the field at New Meadow this afternoon, they will be up against a side they have lost just one of their last 17 FA Cup fixtures on home turf. A nice subplot here is that the match is of special interest to a tiny sunkissed island 4,000 miles away: Shrewsbury\u2019s trio of Aaron Pierre, Omar Beckles and Oliver Norburn all represent the national team of Grenada (population 111,000 \u2013 or 1/14th of the county of Merseyside) with another prospective international, Ro-Shaun Williams, yet to commit. So plenty will be tuning in from the Caribbean to see how the world champions fare against Shrewsbury\u2019s Spice Boys, as the Grenadian team is affectionately known. For Liverpool, that tag has rather different connotations: of lenient management, lax defending and chronic underachievement. That was also an era which saw the only other meeting between these clubs, a 4-0 win for Liverpool at Gay Meadow en route to the Spice Boys\u2019 most ignominious hour. We\u2019re a long way from all that now, though, and while another Wembley final is still some way off, should Liverpool get there this year we can be sure of one thing: they won\u2019t be a cream suit in sight.",

      "body": "<p>Recent letters from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/19/adoption-not-always-best-for-children\" title=\"\">Prof Brid Featherstone and Prof Anna Gupta</a> (20 January) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/21/those-who-suffered-the-trauma-of-a-50s-adoption-must-be-listened-to\" title=\"\">Janice McKinley</a> (22 January) point out the issues of pain, loss and identity faced by many adopted children and adults at different times throughout their lives. As an adoption social worker of some 40 years\u2019 experience, I understand and accept the validity of the points raised. In the 1950s, when McKinley was adopted, adoption was seen as a solution to the needs of infertile couples, and the needs of the child were not understood.</p> <p>Since then, huge strides have been made in understanding the needs of the children, and legislation puts their welfare first (Children Act 1989). This can never remove the distress caused to McKinley and other children of that generation, but we have learned about the importance of understanding and prioritising the child\u2019s needs since then.</p> <p>Adoption will never be the placement plan of choice for children who can return to the care of their parents or relatives. This is made clear by the legislation and reflected in professional practice. Adoption only becomes an option because of complex problems in the child\u2019s network and the consequent risk to them, including that of never achieving a secure and loving permanent home.</p> <p>For those children who are not able to grow up safely in their birth family, there will inevitably be issues of loss and identity to confront at various life stages, whether or not they are adopted. Social workers are now aware of this and work to provide information and appropriate levels of contact for adopted children. Despite the challenges, research demonstrates remarkably good outcomes for many adopted children, who benefit from the stability and commitment of family care.</p> <p>One approach to the dilemma of achieving early permanence for the child while supporting the birth family during court proceedings to decide whether the child should return home or be adopted is the temporary placement known as fostering for adoption. This is where an adopter accepts the placement of a child on a temporary basis as a foster child, with full recognition that the long-term plan will depend on the court\u2019s decision as to whether the child achieves permanence via a return to their family, or adoption. A proportion of these children do return to their birth family at the end of proceedings. However, those children who need adoption will already be fostered in a family who can offer permanence via adoption, and will not have to suffer further delays in identifying adopters, nor the distress of another placement move. Fostering for adoption represents a win-win placement for the child.<br><strong>Jeanne Kaniuk</strong><br><em>Associate director, Coram Early Permanence Centre</em></p> <p>\u2022 The sad letters from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/21/those-who-suffered-the-trauma-of-a-50s-adoption-must-be-listened-to\" title=\"\">Alan Robinson and Janice McKinley</a> (22 January) once again remind me how lucky I was. I, too, was adopted in the 1950s because my birth mother had to give me up shortly after birth due to family pressure.

      "bodyText": "Recent letters from Prof Brid Featherstone and Prof Anna Gupta (20 January) and Janice McKinley (22 January) point out the issues of pain, loss and identity faced by many adopted children and adults at different times throughout their lives. As an adoption social worker of some 40 years\u2019 experience, I understand and accept the validity of the points raised. In the 1950s, when McKinley was adopted, adoption was seen as a solution to the needs of infertile couples, and the needs of the child were not understood. Since then, huge strides have been made in understanding the needs of the children, and legislation puts their welfare first (Children Act 1989). This can never remove the distress caused to McKinley and other children of that generation, but we have learned about the importance of understanding and prioritising the child\u2019s needs since then. Adoption will never be the placement plan of choice for children who can return to the care of their parents or relatives. This is made clear by the legislation and reflected in professional practice. Adoption only becomes an option because of complex problems in the child\u2019s network and the consequent risk to them, including that of never achieving a secure and loving permanent home. For those children who are not able to grow up safely in their birth family, there will inevitably be issues of loss and identity to confront at various life stages, whether or not they are adopted. Social workers are now aware of this and work to provide information and appropriate levels of contact for adopted children. Despite the challenges, research demonstrates remarkably good outcomes for many adopted children, who benefit from the stability and commitment of family care. One approach to the dilemma of achieving early permanence for the child while supporting the birth family during court proceedings to decide whether the child should return home or be adopted is the temporary placement known as fostering for adoption. This is where an adopter accepts the placement of a child on a temporary basis as a foster child, with full recognition that the long-term plan will depend on the court\u2019s decision as to whether the child achieves permanence via a return to their family, or adoption. A proportion of these children do return to their birth family at the end of proceedings. However, those children who need adoption will already be fostered in a family who can offer permanence via adoption, and will not have to suffer further delays in identifying adopters, nor the distress of another placement move. Fostering for adoption represents a win-win placement for the child. Jeanne Kaniuk Associate director, Coram Early Permanence Centre \u2022 The sad letters from Alan Robinson and Janice McKinley (22 January) once again remind me how lucky I was. I, too, was adopted in the 1950s because my birth mother had to give me up shortly after birth due to family pressure. The wonderful couple who adopted me could not have been more loving, supportive and nurturing. I have always thought that this was akin to winning the lottery. Of course, adoption should not be a roll of the dice. I just hope that if the government is indeed encouraging adoption, the necessary funding and resources to ensure this is done well and sympathetically \u2013 particularly for children who have been in care \u2013 have to be in place.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a famous scene from The Dark Knight in which the Joker gives a rare insight into why he does his disruptive, anarchic things. \u201cI\u2019m like a dog chasing cars,\u201d he says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do if I caught one, you know, I just do \u2026 things.\u201d There is a certain Middle Eastern prince whose actions can be most accurately explained by this philosophy. A combination of an indulged upbringing, complete unaccountability and vast sovereign wealth has created in Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (commonly known as MBS) a sort of anarchic, comic-book villain.</p> <p>There was the botched murder of the journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\" title=\"\">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, whose killing not only occurred in a bugged embassy but one where CCTV caught his murderers (who had used their real passports, with their real names) attempting to use a body double in his clothes. But the latest instalment is the allegation that MBS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/21/amazon-boss-jeff-bezoss-phone-hacked-by-saudi-crown-prince\" title=\"\">hacked Jeff Bezos\u2019s phone</a> via a link sent on a WhatsApp message, and extracted a mass of personal information. With no attempt at subtlety or covering his tracks, MBS targeted the world\u2019s richest person. We may have MBS to thank for the leak of Bezos\u2019s messages to his lover, a leak that was then reportedly followed by attempts to blackmail the Amazon chief.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The hissy fit model of making friends and influencing people fits his entitled-adolescent style of foreign relations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But what exactly was MBS looking for? Was it a vindictive strike back against criticism of the prince in the Washington Post, the paper Khashoggi wrote for and which Bezos owns? Was MBS trying to gain some leverage against Bezos? Yet Khashoggi was by no means the most vocal opponent of the Saudi royal family. Why would MBS, a man keen to present himself as a reformer, risk so much international incrimination, such reputational damage, to silence one of the most high-profile Saudis in the western press for nothing more than mild criticism?</p> <p>The answer is, because over a lifetime of impunity he has grown accustomed to satisfying every whim. In terms of sons of autocrats, MBS is less Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2019s despot, who inherited power from his equally brutal father, Hafez, and more Uday Hussein, the famously erratic son of Saddam, who was reputed to have murdered those who caused the most minor offence to him, even among presidential loyalists and his own brothers-in-law. MBS initially consolidated his position by purging friends and family in an \u201canti-corruption drive\u201d. His calamitous campaign in Yemen, launched when he was made minister of defence in his 20s and now a quagmire for the Saudis, was less a calculated defensive manoeuvre and more an immature power move.</p> <p>Aside from those internationally notorious incidents and military adventurism, MBS\u2019s elevation to de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia has introduced dark palace intrigue. Last September, a high-profile and famously loyal bodyguard to his father, King Salman, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/29/bodyguard-saudi-king-reportedly-shot-dead-friend-abdulaziz-al-fagham\" title=\"\">shot and killed</a>, apparently over a \u201cpersonal dispute\u201d with a friend. Rumours began to circulate that the death was a result of the unhappiness of the old security establishment with MBS\u2019s capricious behaviour.</p> <p>Disruption for the sake of it is now a hallmark of Saudi propaganda and online activity. Already an army of Twitter trolls has been activated to attack Bezos and call for a boycott of Amazon to \u201cteach Bezos a lesson he won\u2019t forget\u201d if he does not apologise for alleging that MBS hacked his phone. Last year Twitter <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/12/20/twitter-suspends-saudi-spam/\" title=\"\">suspended</a> 90,000 accounts used to intimidate those who criticised the royal family, and mass-tweeted hashtags glorifying the crown prince. After writing critically about the Saudi royal family, I myself have often been targeted online by identikit Saudi government loyalist accounts claiming I was receiving funding from Qatar.</p> <p>There is no grand masterplan to this online campaign, nor indeed to Saudi\u2019s PR effort as a whole, apart from throwing tantrums at those who point out that perhaps all is not quite together at the heart of the Saudi royal establishment. The hissy-fit model of making friends and influencing people is in keeping with the crown prince\u2019s entitled-adolescent style of foreign relations. It is based on avarice, and frustration that not everything can be bought. On trips to the United States, MBS has secured meetings with Silicon Valley royalty, such as Mark Zuckerberg and Bezos himself.</p> <p>It is, overall, a pattern of behaviour that is making it increasingly hard for western allies to continue painting Saudi Arabia as a competent ally in the region. Western foreign policy has for a long time hinged on a stereotype of regional polarity, with Iran as the unbalanced, evil uranium-enriching twin and Saudi Arabia as the balancing responsible actor, one that is important to keep on side and to support in order to maintain stability in the region.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/24/jeff-bezos-mohammed-bin-salman-whatsapp-hack-phone\">Bezos learns the harsh lesson of texting a crown prince fond of crucifixions | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was always a fiction, but it is one that is now harder to keep up as the crown prince continues to prove that there is no adult in the room. The latest reports are that Boris Johnson has been bombarded with <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/saudi-royal-hack-storm-bombarded-21363439\" title=\"\">emoji messages</a> from MBS on WhatsApp \u2013 putting the prime minister in the position of trying to figure out if he\u2019s been hacked, or if MBS is merely fond of communicating via pictures and not words. As ever, this has also been leaked to the press: MBS seems to think that because there is no functioning media in Saudi Arabia, there is none elsewhere.</p> <p>What sets MBS apart is not cunning design: it is chaos based on whim, executed via a toybox of tools. In fact, perhaps I should revise my earlier comparison. He lacks the intelligence and cunning of a Joker. He is more Scooby-Doo villain than clever arch-nemesis. The only thing Mohammed bin Salman does as consistently as violating international norms is doing so in such a clumsy, traceable way that he is always caught.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a famous scene from The Dark Knight in which the Joker gives a rare insight into why he does his disruptive, anarchic things. \u201cI\u2019m like a dog chasing cars,\u201d he says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do if I caught one, you know, I just do \u2026 things.\u201d There is a certain Middle Eastern prince whose actions can be most accurately explained by this philosophy. A combination of an indulged upbringing, complete unaccountability and vast sovereign wealth has created in Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (commonly known as MBS) a sort of anarchic, comic-book villain. There was the botched murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, whose killing not only occurred in a bugged embassy but one where CCTV caught his murderers (who had used their real passports, with their real names) attempting to use a body double in his clothes. But the latest instalment is the allegation that MBS hacked Jeff Bezos\u2019s phone via a link sent on a WhatsApp message, and extracted a mass of personal information. With no attempt at subtlety or covering his tracks, MBS targeted the world\u2019s richest person. We may have MBS to thank for the leak of Bezos\u2019s messages to his lover, a leak that was then reportedly followed by attempts to blackmail the Amazon chief. But what exactly was MBS looking for? Was it a vindictive strike back against criticism of the prince in the Washington Post, the paper Khashoggi wrote for and which Bezos owns? Was MBS trying to gain some leverage against Bezos? Yet Khashoggi was by no means the most vocal opponent of the Saudi royal family. Why would MBS, a man keen to present himself as a reformer, risk so much international incrimination, such reputational damage, to silence one of the most high-profile Saudis in the western press for nothing more than mild criticism? The answer is, because over a lifetime of impunity he has grown accustomed to satisfying every whim. In terms of sons of autocrats, MBS is less Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2019s despot, who inherited power from his equally brutal father, Hafez, and more Uday Hussein, the famously erratic son of Saddam, who was reputed to have murdered those who caused the most minor offence to him, even among presidential loyalists and his own brothers-in-law. MBS initially consolidated his position by purging friends and family in an \u201canti-corruption drive\u201d. His calamitous campaign in Yemen, launched when he was made minister of defence in his 20s and now a quagmire for the Saudis, was less a calculated defensive manoeuvre and more an immature power move. Aside from those internationally notorious incidents and military adventurism, MBS\u2019s elevation to de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia has introduced dark palace intrigue. Last September, a high-profile and famously loyal bodyguard to his father, King Salman, was shot and killed, apparently over a \u201cpersonal dispute\u201d with a friend. Rumours began to circulate that the death was a result of the unhappiness of the old security establishment with MBS\u2019s capricious behaviour. Disruption for the sake of it is now a hallmark of Saudi propaganda and online activity. Already an army of Twitter trolls has been activated to attack Bezos and call for a boycott of Amazon to \u201cteach Bezos a lesson he won\u2019t forget\u201d if he does not apologise for alleging that MBS hacked his phone. Last year Twitter suspended 90,000 accounts used to intimidate those who criticised the royal family, and mass-tweeted hashtags glorifying the crown prince. After writing critically about the Saudi royal family, I myself have often been targeted online by identikit Saudi government loyalist accounts claiming I was receiving funding from Qatar. There is no grand masterplan to this online campaign, nor indeed to Saudi\u2019s PR effort as a whole, apart from throwing tantrums at those who point out that perhaps all is not quite together at the heart of the Saudi royal establishment. The hissy-fit model of making friends and influencing people is in keeping with the crown prince\u2019s entitled-adolescent style of foreign relations. It is based on avarice, and frustration that not everything can be bought. On trips to the United States, MBS has secured meetings with Silicon Valley royalty, such as Mark Zuckerberg and Bezos himself. It is, overall, a pattern of behaviour that is making it increasingly hard for western allies to continue painting Saudi Arabia as a competent ally in the region. Western foreign policy has for a long time hinged on a stereotype of regional polarity, with Iran as the unbalanced, evil uranium-enriching twin and Saudi Arabia as the balancing responsible actor, one that is important to keep on side and to support in order to maintain stability in the region. This was always a fiction, but it is one that is now harder to keep up as the crown prince continues to prove that there is no adult in the room. The latest reports are that Boris Johnson has been bombarded with emoji messages from MBS on WhatsApp \u2013 putting the prime minister in the position of trying to figure out if he\u2019s been hacked, or if MBS is merely fond of communicating via pictures and not words. As ever, this has also been leaked to the press: MBS seems to think that because there is no functioning media in Saudi Arabia, there is none elsewhere. What sets MBS apart is not cunning design: it is chaos based on whim, executed via a toybox of tools. In fact, perhaps I should revise my earlier comparison. He lacks the intelligence and cunning of a Joker. He is more Scooby-Doo villain than clever arch-nemesis. The only thing Mohammed bin Salman does as consistently as violating international norms is doing so in such a clumsy, traceable way that he is always caught. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist.

While precise numbers are still debated, according to the <a href=\"http://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-features/special-focus/liberation-of-auschwitz\">US Holocaust Memorial Museum</a>, the German SS systematically killed at least 960,000 of the 1.1-1.3 million Jews deported to the camp. More people died at Auschwitz than at any other Nazi concentration camp.</p>\n    <p>When the camp was liberated on 27 January 1945, Soviet troops found grisly evidence of the horror. About 7,000 starving prisoners were found alive, and millions of items of clothing that once belonged to men, women and children were discovered along with 6,350kg of human hair.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In January 1942, the Nazi party had decided to roll out the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d. Camps dedicated solely to the extermination of Jews had been created before, but this was formalised by SS Lieut-Gen Reinhard Heydrich in a speech at the Wannsee conference. The extermination camp Auschwitz II was opened in the same year.</p>\n    <p>Auschwitz II had the largest prisoner population of any of the three main camps on the site. In January 1942, the first chamber using lethal Zyklon B gas was built. Four further chambers were built, and these were used for systematic genocide up until November 1944.</p>\n    <p>Auschwitz was also the site of disturbing medical experimentation on Jewish and Roma prisoners, including practices such as castration and sterilisation. SS captain Dr Josef Mengele was one of the physicians practising there.</p>\n    <p>More than 7,000 Nazi personnel are thought to have served at Auschwitz but only a few hundred have been prosecuted for the crimes committed there. The pursuit of justice has not ceased, with German justice officials saying in 2013 that there were 30 surviving Auschwitz officials who should face prosecution. In 2019, a former guard at Stutthof concentration camp <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/16/former-guard-93-at-nazi-concentration-camp-to-go-on-trial-in-hamburg\">was placed on trial</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/george-arnett\"><b>George Arnett</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But the need to remember and retain the lessons of what became the Holocaust \u2013 from its insidious and incremental beginnings in 1930s Germany to the mass factories of death that began their infernal activities in 1941 \u2013 grows rather than diminishes.

Trump is accused of pressuring Ukraine to investigate his domestic Democratic political rivals, especially 2020 election candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden, and has refused to allow his most senior aides to testify in the process, despite court challenges by the Democrats in the House, who initiated the impeachment process last September. \u201cIt\u2019s for the senators to find out all the information I think they would want,\u201d Lofgren told CNN\u2019s State of the Union politics program on Sunday morning. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing, the chief justice of the United States [John Roberts] presiding over this trial, if he signs a subpoena for a witness to come, we\u2019re going to get that witness \u2026 promptly.

Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff said Republican senators were terrified of hearing fresh, direct testimony in the trial. \u201cI think they\u2019re deathly afraid of what witnesses will have to say and so their whole strategy has been deprive the public of a fair trial,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.

They just try to make the case that you don\u2019t need a fair trial here, you can make this go away.\u201d Meanwhile, Lofgren defended comments by Schiff after he was blasted by Trump in a tweet on Sunday, where Schiff had quoted a CBS report claiming that Republicans\u2019 heads could be \u201con a pike\u201d if they went against the White House and voted for witnesses \u2013 a move that enraged moderate Republicans that Democrats had been hoping would support them in the push for more witnesses.

Trump also went on Twitter early on Sunday to repeat his complaint that: \u201cThe Impeachment Hoax is a massive election interference the likes of which has never been seen before.\u201d The tweet castigated his accusers as \u201cRadical Left, Do Nothing Democrats\u201d. Trump\u2019s legal team opened an aggressive defence of the president in the Senate on Saturday, laying out their case that he broke no laws, and insisting that the trial was merely an attempt to reverse the 2016 election. \u201cThey\u2019re asking you not only to turn over the results of the last election but they\u2019re asking you to remove President Trump from the ballot in an election that\u2019s occurring in approximately nine months,\u201d said White House counsel Pat Cipollone. \u201cThey\u2019re here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history.\u201d Democrats say Trump abused his power to strong-arm Ukraine into conducting an investigation against Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in November\u2019s election, and obstructed Congress by withholding testimony and documents from their inquiry. Trump\u2019s lawyers will resume their arguments on Monday. Trump ally and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Fox News\u2019 Sunday Morning Futures program that he planned when the impeachment trial is over to investigate freshly the activities of Joe Biden in relation to his son Hunter Biden\u2019s past employment on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma. \u201cWe will do oversight of the Bidens to give the vice-president the scrutiny the president has had,\u201d he said, despite theories of corruption relating to the Bidens and Ukraine having previously been debunked. The US temporarily withheld $400m in military aid to Ukraine, while Trump was pressuring Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his rivals. The aid was released in September, in a sequence of events that followed an intelligence community whistleblower formally complaining about Trump\u2019s conduct involving the aid and interactions with Zelenskiy.",

The promise of hundreds of millions in investment to restore some lines axed in the Beeching closures in the early 1960s will come at about the same time as the expected announcement of the termination of the Northern franchise, operated by Arriva. Blyth Valley, a former Labour stronghold in the north-east that turned Conservative in the election and presaged the collapse of the \u201cred wall\u201d, is likely to be among the first places to benefit from the reopening of passenger services. The decision to renationalise Northern, which the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, is due to deliver by Thursday, is likely to be welcomed in the north, but it represents another embarrassing failure of the privatised rail system. Northern politicians and transport bodies said a possible short-term management contract for Arriva \u2013 still yet to be officially ruled out by Shapps \u2013 would be unacceptable, leaving it almost certain that it will become the second major franchise to be renationalised by the Conservatives in less than two years. The state-owned \u201coperator of last resort\u201d, which has run LNER since June 2018, would take over the running of Northern. The franchise was awarded in 2016, but plans to improve services have foundered on the back of delays to infrastructure, including track electrification, and a long-running dispute with unions leading to widespread strikes. Punctuality and reliability collapsed around the introduction of the May 2018 timetable and have largely failed to recover. The results of the national rail passenger survey, due on Tuesday morning, are \u2013 despite official questions over its statistical relevance \u2013 likely to highlight increasing dissatisfaction with the Deutsche Bahn-owned train operator, as well as widespread discontent around the network. But in an effort to regain political impetus, and following the promise of \u201clevelling up\u201d the regions post-Brexit, the Department for Transport will this week set out details of lines that could be reopened. Earlier this month, Shapps visited Blyth, where he discussed a \u00a3100m council blueprint for the reintroduction of passenger services on a Northumberland rail line linking Newcastle to Ashington via Blyth, currently partly used for freight services. He said there was \u00a3500m set aside for reopening lines. A project to restore the line linking Poulton-le-Fylde, near Blackpool, to Fleetwood, visited by Boris Johnson in November on the election campaign, is also likely to be a prime candidate for funding. It could be the second time in a little over two years that the government has talked of reversing Beeching cuts to mask the collapse of a rail franchise. In November 2017, the plan to reopen old lines was announced by Chris Grayling, the then transport secretary, on the same day the government published plans to rip up the Virgin-Stagecoach East Coast rail franchise \u2013 which was eventually nationalised in June 2018. Grayling invited proposals from local partners to pitch for funds to reopen lines where there was a strong business case. More than 4,000 miles of track were removed from the British railway \u2013 about a third of the entire network at the time \u2013 on the guidance of the reports by Richard Beeching in the 1960s. Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: \u201cThe Tory claim to be reversing the Beeching cuts is risible. Passengers haven\u2019t forgotten that this is a government which has cut hundreds of millions of pounds of rail investment.\u201d Meanwhile, there are fears in the north that it could be the victim of cuts to the HS2 high-speed rail network, as the government considers whether to proceed with the full route.

Feilding-Mellen has not spoken publicly since he resigned a fortnight after the disaster. Leaked emails from the project team have already shown that officials felt under pressure to deliver \u201cgood costs for Cllr Feilding-Mellen\u201d and subsequently proposed to swap fire-resistant cladding for cheaper aluminium panels to save \u00a3293,368. More than 90,000 documents have already been circulated to the core participants, including 560 bereaved, relatives and survivors and 20 construction companies. The Guardian understands some of the documents shed light on complex agreements that led to the use of combustible rather than safer non-combustible panels. Others are expected to focus on the failure of the RBKC to conduct proper building regulations checks. Building control officers from the council carried out 16 separate visits to check on works, but still approved them. The council\u2019s leader, Elizabeth Campbell, last week admitted for the first time \u201cfailings in respect to building control\u201d and said: \u201cWe will not shirk our responsibilities. If we have done something wrong, we will say so. \u201cThere is a stark reality we face. Seventy-two people died. This council could have, and should have, done more to stop it happening.\u201d",

This revealed the association between smoking in pregnancy and increased rates of infant mortality. In 1964, the opportunity arose to follow up these children, with a much wider remit including their education and overall development, and Ron was appointed senior research officer.</p> <p>This massive and influential longitudinal study required the co-operation of every director of education and medical officer of health in Britain, and a range of complex methodologies \u2013 questionnaire design, critical path analysis, advanced statistics, use of computers and the tools and concepts of the demographer.</p> <p>Within 18 months the team was committed to produce a report for the government\u2019s review of primary education (published as the Plowden Report in 1967). The results were published separately in 1972 as From Birth to Seven, which Ron co-authored with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/mar/15/health.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Neville Butler</a> and Harvey Goldstein, and which had considerable impact with its most prominent conclusion: that substantial social class differences in the attainment, health and development of Britain\u2019s children were clearly evident from as early as seven years of age.

      "bodyText": "Ron Davie, who has died aged 90, was the former director of the National Children\u2019s Bureau, which carries out research and works collaboratively to influence policy and improve services for children and young people, and co-director of the longitudinal National Child Development Study (NCDS) into the physical, educational and social development of children in Britain. The NCDS started in 1958 as the Perinatal Mortality Study, gathering information on the births of 15,000 children born in the week between 3 and 9 March that year. This revealed the association between smoking in pregnancy and increased rates of infant mortality. In 1964, the opportunity arose to follow up these children, with a much wider remit including their education and overall development, and Ron was appointed senior research officer. This massive and influential longitudinal study required the co-operation of every director of education and medical officer of health in Britain, and a range of complex methodologies \u2013 questionnaire design, critical path analysis, advanced statistics, use of computers and the tools and concepts of the demographer. Within 18 months the team was committed to produce a report for the government\u2019s review of primary education (published as the Plowden Report in 1967). The results were published separately in 1972 as From Birth to Seven, which Ron co-authored with Neville Butler and Harvey Goldstein, and which had considerable impact with its most prominent conclusion: that substantial social class differences in the attainment, health and development of Britain\u2019s children were clearly evident from as early as seven years of age. The study is continuing, with further follow ups, now that the \u201cchildren\u201d are 62, and has influenced policy in Britain and overseas. In 1974 Ron moved from the NCB, where he was by now deputy director, to a professorship in educational psychology in Cardiff, returning to the NCB as director in 1981. At this point the main focus of the NCB was its significant research programme, particularly the NCDS. Under Ron\u2019s guidance, the NCDS moved first to City University and then to the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at the University of London Institute of Education. This enabled the NCB to engage in a wider range of research projects, largely in the field of child care and children with disabilities and special needs, many of them commissioned by central and local government to evaluate new services. The centre of gravity also began to move towards developing and disseminating good practice, as well as looking at the implications of research and practice for policy development. The largest single focus of practice development was parenting and early childhood, with the establishment of what became the Early Childhood Unit; and on Ron\u2019s watch the semi-independent Voluntary Council for Handicapped Children, now the Council for Disabled Children, grew in strength and influence. Ron\u2019s appointment as professional adviser to the all-party parliamentary group for children, and the establishment of a policy and practice review group, drawn from senior policy makers and professionals across education, child care and child health were examples of a new collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to working with children and young people, which became a key hallmark of the work of the NCB. Ron understood the importance of underpinning proactive interdisciplinary policy for children with a robust legislative framework. Under his leadership the NCB played a major role in the drafting and subsequent implementation of the 1989 Children Act, which promotes the principle of the welfare of the child as being paramount in all decisions affecting the child, in the courts and beyond.

In 1961 he took a postgraduate training course at the University of Birmingham and accepted a post as a child psychologist on the Isle of Wight. His life took a change of direction when his former course tutor at Birmingham, Mia Kellmer Pringle, who had just moved to be the first director of the new National Bureau for Co-operation in Child Care (later renamed the National Children\u2019s Bureau) appointed Ron to the NCDS.

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s the match report from Andy Hunter. Tranmere manager Micky Mellon also spoke and revealed his wonder at Harry Maguire\u2019s goal. \u201cThree defenders scored their first three goals and that showed the quality they have...it\u2019s outrageous a centre-forward coming forward and bending one in like that.\u201d And Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r speaks. The players went out on that pitch, we played football the way it should be played on a pitch that was very very difficult to play on. We were playing against a League One team and I thought the attitude was spot-on. I think if you just play long balls and give them a fight we are not used to that and it went well. Every game is good for your confidence and we just need to rest. [On Anti-Glazer chants] We just have to stay together and try to win the next one and the one after that and we will get the good times back. More from Mark Exton: \u201cOGS is texting the ground staff at OT: \u201cScrape off the grass down to the mud...spread sand around the wings...I\u2019ve found the way!\u201d And Jesse Lingard spoke too, admitting \u201cI have not been in the best of form\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s always nice to score\u201d, and that \u201ceveryone contributed\u201d. United had six different scorers today. Harry Maguire speaks It was really important that we got the win, coming off a bad performance and losing to Burnley. Getting to the next round is what we came to do. [On his goal] It\u2019s been a long time coming, I have had a lot of chance and it\u2019s nice to put the ball in the back of the net. It was difficult. We knew we had to get the ball down and play. If they played us at their own game they would probably have beaten us. The damage was done in the first half and Ole can breathe easy. Three goals in six minutes did the job and United were able to fill their boots. Tranmere were tired and this was a bridge too far. No need to talk about the pitch and well done to their fans. The One Show and the fifth round draw awaits United. 90+1 min: Greenwood has one last go at trying to find another but Monthe eventually stops him in his tracks. 90 min: Just two minutes to be added on. 89 min: Phil Jones steps out to stop an attack. This has been one of the better days for Manchester United\u2019s Edvard Munch-influenced stopper. No calamity to speak of, and a goal. 87 min: Pereira takes a knock and stays down, and it looks like he took a nasty one to his ankle. No injuries until now for United but that would be a blow if Pereira was the latest victim of the midfield curse. 85 min: The Manchester United fans are singing that Ed Woodward song again. It began with a song directed at former City player Davies then switched to the unloved club suit. Chong, meanwhile. rattles the crossbar with a ripping shot. 83 min: Shaw gets on the end of some link-up play but his left-foot shot is weak. 82 min: Hepburn-Murphy, spins inside and goes for a shot from outside the box. Just wide, with Romero scrabbling. He then creates a chance for Morris, whose shot is saved with some comfort by Romero. 80 min: Mullin and Hepburn-Murphy have been lively since coming on. Perhaps playing an unchanged team was something of an error, not enough to make a difference but Tranmere\u2019s energy levels did not sustain beyond their opening salvo. Once Maguire scored they were spent up. 78 min: A foul on Connor Jennings forces a free-kick on the edge of the box for Tranmere. Mullin will take it, and he whacks that some way into the stands. It has not been their day. 75 min: Ole has a grin on his face. Relief, for now at least. His team are playing some lovely stuff; Lingard almost makes it seven by getting time and space and then drilling a shot off the base of the post. 73 min: Double Tranmere subbing: Blackett-Taylor for Hepburn-Murphy, and Paul Mullin, scorer of the winner v Watford, comes on for Ferrier. 72 min: Dalot and Greenwood, two players with an eye on a first-team berth, have continued to take up the pace. They want more goals to prove their worth. 71 min: United, by the way, are cruising, but playing pretty patterns on the edge of the Tranmere box. Chong has a shot well saved by Davies, who you can\u2019t even say has had a bad game, barring perhaps the penalty though he had little choice there. 69 min: The Tranmere fans have been a credit, it has to be said. The United fans have been quiet in the second half, and some of them might be fancying a trip back across the Wirral. 67 min: John Delaney, maybe not that John Delaney but then again it might be, has this to say: \u201cI like the \u2018Tequila\u2019 chant, everyone should sack the game off and have a big old party! Some things are bigger than football... like getting hammered and dancing on tables.\u201d 65 min: Subs: Off comes Perkins for Gilmour, with the veteran midfielder able to rest up after being given a frightful chasing. 65 min: Pereira tries to get in on the act but his shot spins wide. 64 min: Off comes Harry Maguire, which makes sense considering he has been playing with an injury. The captain got the game going with that opening goal. Williams comes on. 63 min: Brandon Williams is set to come on for United, and has been waiting on the sidelines. 61 min: By the way, the ever active Blackett-Taylor almost made something happen, only for the move to come to nothing. 58 min: The Tranmere song is to this piece of 60s kitsch. 57 min: The Tranmere fans are now singing very loudly indeed. Now, what is that 60s kitsch song they are singing to. We all know it, but I can\u2019t put my finger on it. Greenwood sends Davies the wrong way with a cool finish. 56 min: Penalty to Manchester United, as Greenwood sends Chong away, and Davies fouls the youngster. Yellow card for the keeper. 55 min: \u201cPlease, please tell me that Mike Dean is there and the cameras have spotted him,\u201d asks Gareth Rogers. Nothing like this so far. 54 min: An unamused Micky Mellon looks like he has been sucking a lemon rather than a, well, melon on the sidelines. They dared to dream but this has been something of nightmare. 53 min: Luke Shaw, who actually did OK last week at Liverpool after some initial confusion, has looked decent on the left flank, though has been given plenty of space. 51 min: The Tranmere fans trying their best to get back into this, the noise from the early stages has abated. A drummer has taken up the cudgels and got the songs going. 49 min: Early sight of Chong\u2019s mane as he chases down a backpass to Tranmere goalie Davies, only for the City-supporting custodian to wallop clear. 47 min: Greenwood, who ebbed from view as the rest of his team were plundering goals, crosses the ball and Dalot makes a mess of it. 46 min: Off goes Blackett-Taylor on one of the runs he made during those long-forgotten early stages. Two changes for Manchester United, and understandable, too. Tahith Chong and Fred come on for Anthony Martial and Nemanja Matic. Ole working out when to rest players? Harry Maguire surely worth a few minutes off, too. Important reporting from Sean Ingle. Jamie Jackson saw another sadly one-sided FA Cup tie. A correction on Jesse Lingard: that was his first goal in English football since January 25 2019; he also scored v Astana in the Europa League in November. There\u2019s been a London derby in the Women\u2019s FA Cup. Hello, hello, United are back. That\u2019s the same scoreline as 1976 but in half the time. Five great goals for United and Tranmere\u2019s big day has been as muddied as Phil Jones\u2019 shirt. Martial uses Morris as a screen and lays up an unerring finish. 43 min: At this point, would it suit both teams to just give up on this. Sir Alex is in the stands and laughing away with a pal. 42 min: This is a test for Tranmere...no, it\u2019s over. Micky Mellon looks utterly downcast. United have had four attempts on target and each has resulted in a goal. Pereira takes the corner and Phil Jones heads in. And what a broad smile he greets that with. 39 min: A long session of possession play from United, with Tranmere trying desperately to hold their shape. Matic wins a corner. 38 min: Harry Maguire seems to be enjoying his chances to bring the ball out of defence in an old-style libero fashion. He is being given space to do so. Lingard also enjoying himself in finding space. He forces a corner. 36 min: Tranmere look a little weary. United look full of running and passing. 34 min: And the United fans are singing the name of their manager and lustily so. Recent service resumed from Jesse Lingard as he makes a mess of a cross from Luke Shaw, who is playing as a line-hugging left winger. Martial makes a claim for a penalty when he and Clarke collide but the referee Lee Mason will not have a bar of that. 32 min: Mary Waltz takes to the floor: \u201cIs United \u201cin chaos?\u2019 Maybe not. They are in denial. Good news for Ole ripping apart Tranmere but this win doesn\u2019t mean they can skip this transfer period and go with what they have now. Even if they overpay for a midfielder and a striker they can make their money back by getting into the Champions League.\u201d 31 min: On with the football, where Tranmere are pushing up a bit, and having a go without really looking too convinced that they can get back into this game. 30 min: Daire Finnie emails in: \u201cThat \u2018found their level\u2019 remark ..An excellent two-footed tackle, winning the ball cleanly whilst also making United look like the clowns they truly are. I bet Jonathan Wilson is looking on admiringly.\u201d 29 min: The United songbook in the Prenton Park cowshed has turned to the Glazer family. \u201cWe want Glazers out\u201d gets a hearty go. 27 min: United passing the ball around on the Prenton Park paddy field with far more comfort than they have done for some time on the Old Trafford bowling green surface. Funny old game. 26 min: Duncan Edwards emails in: \u201cOh dear, John, seems like you are going to have to rip up your United in chaos gag script and just commentate on the match. Now that\u2019s funny.\u201d Lads, it\u2019s Tranmere. 24 min: Perkins falls over on a pothole but Jesse Lingard is penalised. That looks a harsh decision. Blackett-Taylot then escapes down the flank and puts a promising ball across goal but there are no takers. 23 min: Caprice (32), blocks a shot from Mason Greenwood, who looks desperate to join in the jamboree of goals. 21 min: Lingard fancies another, as Greenwood lays him up. He tries to whip the ball but misjudges the spin required. It goes wide. United queueing up to fill their satchels with goals. 20 min: Chance for Tranmere as Ferrier cuts in and shoots, but Romero gets down and saves well. 19 min: Almost another as Dalot carves down the right again and Martial tries to find a way through; his shot fizzes wide. 18 min: Three goals within six minutes from United; the panic can abate for now. Mind you, Tranmere were three goals down to Watford and drew 3-3. A first goal since 2018 for Lingard...nice pass from Maguire and then Lingard bends in his shot beyond Davies. 15 min: At this point, it would feel remiss not to suggest that perhaps United have finally found their level...they are stroking the ball around with class. 14 min: \u201cWe\u2019re on the march with Ole\u2019s army,\u201d sing the United fans. They\u2019re all going to Wem-ber-lee. Dalot on the overlap comes on to a pass from Martial, cuts outside and smashes it. A great goal. Another first goal for United. 13 min: Maguire booed by the home fans. He must have done something right. 11 min: Maguire stepped forward, fancied his chances and took ownership of the situation. Big smile from Ole on the sideline, as well there might be. Wallop, that is a howitzer, and his first goal for United...it took a slight deflection off Peter Clarke. 9 min: Harry Maguire, looking, well, harried, has to clear behind. Tranmere\u2019s latest corner comes to naught but the most dangerous team on show is that who used to be sponsored the Wirral\u2019s council. 8 min: Mark Exton asks: \u201cPlease tell me OGS took the squad somewhere to train on a surface similar to today\u2019s! Or did they stay at Carrington, in their bubble?\u201d No suggestion they did, Mark. 7 min: A spell of United attacking with Greenwood to the fore. It comes to an end when Tranmere break. Blackett-Taylor barges into the United box and goes down. Penalty? No, a foul by the Tranmere attacker and Phil Jones is hurt and limping. His shirts and shorts are now around 35 percent covered in mud. 4 min: Phil Jones is booked for clattering Ferrier, and he is also already smeared in mud. Not a good start for United\u2019s Jonah. 3 min: Tranmere for a corner and it causes panic in the United box, as Romero is unsure of the ball\u2019s flight and the ground below him. Jennings\u2019 shot goes straight at Romero. An early warning sight... 1 min: And away we go....great throwback atmosphere in Birkenhead. Boos for every United touch, and lots of chanting. Mason Greenwood involved early, though does seem to get his feet stuck on one of the gulleys down the flank of the field. Harry Maguire, who never seems to get rested, steps on to the field gingerly as the teams take to the field. And here\u2019s that famous pitch. OGS speaks. [On the pitch]Nothing we can do about it other than play on it. We are not going to come away with any excuses. We want to play, we want to have runners and energy. It\u2019s about giving some players a chance; we have many games coming up\u2026We are together thought there\u2019s a lot of noise going on around us. Inside the walls of the Carrington training ground we are all together. The lads stayed at home tonight, not in a hotel so they didn\u2019t have a night playing with their phones and all that. Micky Mellon, a Scotsman, speaks about his Tranmere team. You only have to look around to see the huge numbers. It\u2019s terrific for the local community to have Manchester United in town. [On the pitch] We have to play on it as well\u2026we\u2019ll give it a right good go\u2026there\u2019s lot of adrenaline. Reminder that Tranmere were a non-league club as recently as last May, and came from the National League via the play-offs. They are in League One after being promoted straight away, but this season has been more of struggle; they are third bottom. These two clubs have actually met this season, in the Football League trophy, where Tranmere beat United\u2019s Under-23 team 3-2 but they have only met once at full senior level, in the League Cup on September 1976. United, managed by Tommy Docherty, won 5-0, thanks to two goals from Gerry Daly, and one each from Stuart Pearson, Gordon Hill and Lou Macari. Steve Coppell, in the United team that day, had been signed from Tranmere. Paul Mullin scored the winning goal against Watford on Thursday. Ole\u2019s hopes spring eternal. For Manchester United, Romero. Dalot, Lindelof, Shaw, Lingard, Martial and Greenwood come in; it looks like Ole has opted for three centre backs, unless Phil Jones is going to resurrect his central midfield role of yore. Luke Shaw played at centre back last week so perhaps Ole has opted for a Pulisian/Allardici/Sgt Wilko approach of playing as many defenders as possible. There has been one hell of an effort from volunteers and the club to get the pitch ready for this match, really quick turnaround. It looks like the centre of the field is where the best surface is. Prenton Park also hosts the Liverpool women\u2019s team and a waterlogged pitch caused the cancellation of a women\u2019s Merseyside derby not too long ago. Here are the teams. Ian Muir, Dave Challinor, Stuart \u201cBarndoor\u201d Barlow, Kenny Lunt, Wayne Allison, Aldo, Friday nights at Prenton Park, Half Man Half Biscuit blowing out an appearance on The Tube so they could stay on the Wirral to watch their heroes, reaching the semis in that weird Mercantile Credit Festival thing in 1988: how\u2019s about that for all the Tranmere cliches? After coming through an epic two-parter with Watford in the finest traditions of the FA Cup, now for not so-mighty Manchester United, the club - \u2018cloob\u2019 in the case of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r - going through more crises than a series of The Colbys. The pitch is a throwback to the Baseball Ground of the 1970s, and might even redouble as a location for the film 1917, so it could be a great leveller...and here comes the gag about how it could reduce Tranmere to Manchester United\u2019s level. There is a shock in the offing here, though would it really be a shock if Micky Mellon and his men were swigging champagne in celebration at full-time? Kick-off is at 3pm UK time, join me",

China remains the centre of the outbreak of a deadly coronavirus, with cases and deaths heavily concentrated in Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan. Cases have been reported in other countries around the world as health authorities scramble to prevent a pandemic. Authorities in China have placed at least 20 cities on lockdown as they battle to contain the spread. Travel restrictions have been imposed in cities across Hubei province where the outbreak originated. Wholesale closure of transport infrastructure has taken place across the region, affecting the movement of at least 36 million people. Infections have been confirmed in almost all of China\u2019s provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. Where did it start and where could it go next? The outbreak is centred on the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and home to more than 11 million people. Efforts have begun to build a 1,000-bed hospital in a matter of days to relieve pressure on existing Wuhan medical facilities that have been overwhelmed with patients. There have also been reports of empty supermarket shelves and barricades going up. Wuhan\u2019s international airport serves 104 destinations including 29 outside China. There are three direct flights a week from Wuhan to Heathrow, where arrivals from the affected city will now enter through a separate area. Screening has started at the three US airports where Wuhan flights land. Checks are also in place at airports in the other east Asian countries that have confirmed the virus is present. Cases spread to France, Australia, Malaysia, Canada and US France has identified three cases. Authorities say two of the three infected people belong to the same family. One of the patients, a 48-year-old man, passed through Wuhan. He was in contact with about 10 people before he was taken into care. In Australia, three patients in New South Wales and one in Victoria have been diagnosed with the virus. Malaysia confirmed its first three cases on Saturday. All are Chinese nationals on holiday from Wuhan who arrived in the country from Singapore two days earlier. Canada said it discovered its first case, a man is his 50s who recently flew from Wuhan to Guangzhou and then on to Toronto. US health officials have announced three positive tests. Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan and Macao Japan\u2019s health authorities in Japan \u2013 a destination for many lunar new year holidaymakers \u2013 confirmed a second case on Friday.

A ballast of 217 runs after declining to enforce the follow-on usually results in hours of relative tedium as an insurmountable lead is harvested.</p> <p>But it did not quite work out like that at the Wanderers as England lost wickets at regular intervals long before they had disappeared over the hill and far away. The whole point of not enforcing the follow-on is to bat the other side completely out of the game. But that was not their obvious gameplan.</p> <p>At the close England had been bowled out for 248, their lead a very healthy 465. But they did not reach this destination in the approved manner. At one point they were 160 for six as Joe Root watched his middle-order batsmen come and go as if it was somehow a formality that they would set a massive target via an array of swishes outside the off-stump. The pitch is still pacy but fundamentally true, so a big lead was required.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/jan/26/south-africa-v-england-fourth-test-day-three-live\">England set South Africa target of 466 to win fourth Test \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The young openers were the least culpable of the batsmen. Zak Crawley was caught behind defending; Dominic Sibley flicked on the legside again and this time he was caught at midwicket though these dismissals did not happen until the pair had posted another half-century partnership. A couple of players are looking jaded and distracted at the crease and in need of runs to keep the hounds at bay. Joe Denly is one of those and his luck was out; an inside edge on to his pad ended with the stumps disturbed.</p> <p>By contrast Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope were in magisterial form but both succumbed to extravagant drives. Jos Buttler, however, is in that distracted category and ill at ease at the crease. After one sumptuous back-foot drive he, too, swished \u2013 though not in his case not through over-confidence \u2013 and there was an air of resignation as he departed. Sam Curran, on a king pair, was not circumspect for long. Nor was Mark Wood.</p> <p>Meanwhile Root remained at the crease until partnered by the last man, Stuart Broad. The captain fell to the catch of the day by Faf du Plessis, diving spectacularly to his right at slip. Throughout the second half of his innings Root looked as if he might be playing himself out of form especially when he tried a range of one-day shots. But at least he managed to stay there long enough to post his third and scratchiest half-century of the series.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e37890e0c64e734d4742b1e4cd2d2f8c929ee767\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e37890e0c64e734d4742b1e4cd2d2f8c929ee767/0_103_3280_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Root\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Root hits out during his patchy half-century in England\u2019s second innings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>South Africa\u2019s most economical bowler was Vernon Philander but that was because he spent most of the afternoon in the dressing room or having a scan. It was not a great day for Philander, a reminder that it is practically impossible for cricketers to choreograph their farewell from the international stage \u2013 though Alastair Cook and Henry Blofeld have managed this quite well recently.</p> <p>For the third time in succession Philander was out in the first over of the morning session. Later he would leave the field with a dodgy hamstring after bowling only nine deliveries; then to cap his miserable day he learned that he had gained one demerit point, which will not inconvenience him greatly since he is retiring from international cricket, but he has also lost 15% of his match fee in his final game for South Africa after giving Buttler a send-off on Saturday. Ah, well. Next stop on his cricketing journey is Taunton in early April, not a great place for dodgy hamstrings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jan/25/england-selection-experiment-jos-buttler-must-be-shelved\">Jos Buttler\u2019s batting struggles demand a rethink from England | Chris Stocks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After Philander\u2019s dismissal batting actually looked more comfortable for the South African batsmen than at any other time in their innings. Quinton de Kock reached his half-century from only 72 balls with some silky strokeplay. Alongside him Dwaine Pretorius was well organised and he drove strongly when given the opportunity.</p> <p>This pair had added 79 together when Stokes intervened. He found a little extra bounce and Pretorius\u2019s edge was neatly caught in the gully by Crawley. In the next over Wood delivered the best ball of the morning. Bowling round the wicket, he got a full-length delivery to nip off the pitch and trim the bails of De Kock after passing through his gate. Wood celebrated with the broadest of smiles for De Kock has been the most treasured South African wicket in this series, an accolade unlikely to be overtaken by Dane Paterson, who now swung lustily; Buttler caught the edge and Wood had his second five-wicket-haul in Test cricket.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Spin\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>The return of Wood as a force in Tests is one of several boons for England on this tour. It may be that he will join a list of English pacemen who had fleeting but significant careers. That list is obviously headed by Frank Tyson; it might include Simon Jones, Dean Headley and the more distant Nobby Clark and Ken Farnes. In the best of all possible worlds Wood might take too many wickets to qualify for this list.</p> <p>His success here opens up possibilities. Through excellent management and personal dedication he has managed to prepare himself for Test cricket so effectively that he has been close to his best in the past two Tests without playing any red-ball cricket for 11 months. Once this was regarded as impossible.</p> <p>As for England\u2019s next overseas tours perhaps he could play one Test in Sri Lanka, a couple in India and three in Australia. Who knows? Currently he gets into the best side when fit. In the future he might line up alongside Jofra Archer occasionally and dovetail with him more frequently. His continued presence in the squad would be a blessing to players and spectators alike as he invariably brings a smile to Test cricket.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The third innings in a match such as this can be a bit dull. A ballast of 217 runs after declining to enforce the follow-on usually results in hours of relative tedium as an insurmountable lead is harvested. But it did not quite work out like that at the Wanderers as England lost wickets at regular intervals long before they had disappeared over the hill and far away. The whole point of not enforcing the follow-on is to bat the other side completely out of the game. But that was not their obvious gameplan. At the close England had been bowled out for 248, their lead a very healthy 465. But they did not reach this destination in the approved manner. At one point they were 160 for six as Joe Root watched his middle-order batsmen come and go as if it was somehow a formality that they would set a massive target via an array of swishes outside the off-stump. The pitch is still pacy but fundamentally true, so a big lead was required. The young openers were the least culpable of the batsmen. Zak Crawley was caught behind defending; Dominic Sibley flicked on the legside again and this time he was caught at midwicket though these dismissals did not happen until the pair had posted another half-century partnership. A couple of players are looking jaded and distracted at the crease and in need of runs to keep the hounds at bay. Joe Denly is one of those and his luck was out; an inside edge on to his pad ended with the stumps disturbed. By contrast Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope were in magisterial form but both succumbed to extravagant drives. Jos Buttler, however, is in that distracted category and ill at ease at the crease. After one sumptuous back-foot drive he, too, swished \u2013 though not in his case not through over-confidence \u2013 and there was an air of resignation as he departed. Sam Curran, on a king pair, was not circumspect for long. Nor was Mark Wood. Meanwhile Root remained at the crease until partnered by the last man, Stuart Broad. The captain fell to the catch of the day by Faf du Plessis, diving spectacularly to his right at slip. Throughout the second half of his innings Root looked as if he might be playing himself out of form especially when he tried a range of one-day shots. But at least he managed to stay there long enough to post his third and scratchiest half-century of the series. South Africa\u2019s most economical bowler was Vernon Philander but that was because he spent most of the afternoon in the dressing room or having a scan. It was not a great day for Philander, a reminder that it is practically impossible for cricketers to choreograph their farewell from the international stage \u2013 though Alastair Cook and Henry Blofeld have managed this quite well recently. For the third time in succession Philander was out in the first over of the morning session. Later he would leave the field with a dodgy hamstring after bowling only nine deliveries; then to cap his miserable day he learned that he had gained one demerit point, which will not inconvenience him greatly since he is retiring from international cricket, but he has also lost 15% of his match fee in his final game for South Africa after giving Buttler a send-off on Saturday. Ah, well. Next stop on his cricketing journey is Taunton in early April, not a great place for dodgy hamstrings. After Philander\u2019s dismissal batting actually looked more comfortable for the South African batsmen than at any other time in their innings. Quinton de Kock reached his half-century from only 72 balls with some silky strokeplay. Alongside him Dwaine Pretorius was well organised and he drove strongly when given the opportunity. This pair had added 79 together when Stokes intervened. He found a little extra bounce and Pretorius\u2019s edge was neatly caught in the gully by Crawley. In the next over Wood delivered the best ball of the morning. Bowling round the wicket, he got a full-length delivery to nip off the pitch and trim the bails of De Kock after passing through his gate. Wood celebrated with the broadest of smiles for De Kock has been the most treasured South African wicket in this series, an accolade unlikely to be overtaken by Dane Paterson, who now swung lustily; Buttler caught the edge and Wood had his second five-wicket-haul in Test cricket. The return of Wood as a force in Tests is one of several boons for England on this tour. It may be that he will join a list of English pacemen who had fleeting but significant careers. That list is obviously headed by Frank Tyson; it might include Simon Jones, Dean Headley and the more distant Nobby Clark and Ken Farnes. In the best of all possible worlds Wood might take too many wickets to qualify for this list. His success here opens up possibilities. Through excellent management and personal dedication he has managed to prepare himself for Test cricket so effectively that he has been close to his best in the past two Tests without playing any red-ball cricket for 11 months. Once this was regarded as impossible. As for England\u2019s next overseas tours perhaps he could play one Test in Sri Lanka, a couple in India and three in Australia. Who knows? Currently he gets into the best side when fit. In the future he might line up alongside Jofra Archer occasionally and dovetail with him more frequently. His continued presence in the squad would be a blessing to players and spectators alike as he invariably brings a smile to Test cricket.",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus\u2019s ability to spread appears to be getting stronger, the country\u2019s health commission minister has said. He added that the incubation period is one to 14 days and that unlike Sars, it is infectious during that period. The death toll from the outbreak has risen to 56, while authorities said just over 2,000 have been infected. Health experts believe the real number of cases to be higher, as hospitals across Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, have experienced shortages of testing kits. Another 1,000 cases are expected in Wuhan, the city\u2019s mayor said. Zhou Xianwang said it was stepping up construction of specialist hospitals. He added that 5million people had left the city for new year celebrations. The US, France and Japan said they were arranging evacuation flights for people trapped in Wuhan, which has been placed under quarantine. The US and Japan each reported a new case, taking the number of people infected to three and four respectively. Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea each confirmed a new case, while Thailand said it had identified three new cases. In the UK, 52 people have tested negative for the coronavirus, the Department of Health and Social Care said. No one in the UK has tested positive. The UK home secretary, Priti Patel, refused to confirm or deny reports that Britain is planning to evacuate more than 200 of its citizens in Wuhan. The foreign office has advised against travel to Hubei province. A nationwide ban on trading wildlife has been imposed in China after experts warned that the sale of sometimes endangered species for human consumption is the cause both of the new coronavirus outbreak and other past epidemics. Residents of Hubei province are to be banned from Hong Kong. The city state will also ban entry from Monday to people who have visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, the city\u2019s government said. The rule does not apply to Hong Kong residents. Long-distance buses have been suspended in the eastern province of Shandong, which has a population of 100 million people. Long-distance buses have also been banned from departing from or arriving at Beijing and Shanghai. The financial hub of Shanghai, which has extensive international air connections, on Sunday reported its first death: that of an 88-year-old man who already had health problems. Beijing said that the reopening of schools and universities after the new year holiday had been indefinitely suspended. Upcoming tennis (Fed Cup) and football (Women\u2019s Olympic qualifying) events have been moved from China. Boxing and basketball events had already been relocated because of the coronavirus. Two of Hong Kong\u2019s biggest attractions, Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park, announced they would close indefinitely. The city state reported its sixth case of coronavirus on Sunday. Jonathan Ashworth, the UK\u2019s shadow health secretary, urged the government to reassure the public it is sufficiently prepared as the NHS is already struggling in the flu season. He told the Guardian: The NHS is currently under immense strain this winter with staff already working flat out and hospitals overcrowded. We need urgent reassurance from ministers they have a plan to ensure we have capacity in place to deal with Coronavirus should we need to, AFP\u2019s Hong Kong correspondent is reporting what is believed to be the youngest person - a baby girl - infected so far. This gives an idea on how difficult it may be to prevent the coronavirus spreading despite the quarantine. Hong Kong has imposed new restrictions on people from the province at the centre of the outbreak, AFP\u2019s correspondent there reports: Another sporting event has been moved from China as a result of the coronavirus: Earlier, I reported on protests in Hong Kong against a plan to turn a newly built but currently empty public housing block in Fanling into a quarantine facility for people with coronavirus. Here ia an update from AFP: Dozens of local residents and protesters opposed to the idea held rallies outside the complex on Sunday, with some setting up road blocks. In the evening, police said assailants threw petrol bombs at the buildings. An AFP photographer on the scene saw fierce flames coming from the entrance of two apartment blocks before firefighters got the blaze under control. Riot police were on scene and protesters had left, although some local residents were arguing with officers who used pepper spray. The Centre for Health Protection said the plan to turn the housing estate into a quarantine zone would be suspended. The agency has already turned a holiday park in an isolated rural area into a working quarantine facility. Two other holiday parks located away from major housing estates are also ready to be used as similar facilities. But officials say they have struggled to find hotels and spare rooms for doctors and nurses working on the isolation wards where patients are being treated. The virus outbreak comes at a time when Hong Kong is already boiling with widespread anti-government sentiment after seven months of often violent pro-democracy protests. This is from Reuters: As of Sunday afternoon, 52 people across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland had been tested for the new coronavirus, but all tests were confirmed as negative, the Department for Health and Social Care has just said. It said it will be providing an update on the figures every day at 2pm. Nathalie MacDermott, NIHR (National Institute for Health Research) academic clinical lecturer, at King\u2019s College London, has said the suggestion that coronavirus is infectious during the incubation period is \u201cnot surprising\u201d, adding: This was taken account of in some of the modelling exercises undertaken by colleagues recently, and was likely given the degree of spread of the outbreak within China. There is often the question of whether individuals who may be infected with the virus but never show any symptoms (asymptomatic or subclinical cases) may also be contagious to others. The report from Zhejiang suggests this may be the case, but further confirmation is required. This report highlights the importance of identifying individuals who may have travelled from affected regions or had contact with a known case of 2019-nCoV infection to establish if they may have symptoms and to request they limit their attendance at public gatherings in order to try and contain the spread of infection. While these findings may cause concern, the possibility of transmission of virus during the incubation period and from asymptomatic individuals has been considered by public health authorities and the WHO, and has been included as a factor within response plans to tackle an outbreak of an airborne virus. AFP has a report from an overwhelmed-sounding hospital in Wuhan: At one Wuhan hospital AFP visited, there were long queues of sick patients, many coughing, with overwhelmed staff unable to process them quickly. Outside the Red Cross facility - which is one of the hospitals people are sent to for initial tests if they show signs of infection - patients told AFP they felt exasperated and helpless. \u201cIt has been two days since I slept, and I have been wandering from hospital to hospital,\u201d said a man in his 30s, who was trying to see a doctor because he was worried he might be infected. \u201cAt this rate, my turn will be tomorrow morning at best.\u201d Those who spoke to AFP told of extremely long queues and disorganisation. One spoke of a fear that sick patients with fevers will infect each other while waiting in long queues, even if they didn\u2019t have the coronavirus when they first arrived at the hospital. Another man said he had seen several people faint while waiting. Many people carried their own plastic stools to sit on, while one pragmatic man had brought a lounge chair with him. \u201cIt takes at least five hours to see a doctor,\u201d one woman, who didn\u2019t want to be named, told AFP. The woman, who was with her son, said the management of the hospital was \u201creally messy\u201d. An old man wearing a Mao cap said he had waited all day to see a doctor, only to be sent home because of a \u201clack of room\u201d. AFP saw some patients inside the hospital who were without masks, despite city orders that anyone going out must wear them. Patients were taking their own temperatures with mercury thermometers, by mouth or armpit, and there were no checks on anyone entering or leaving the hospital. \u201cThere is no more space, the staff are overwhelmed, there is a shortage of some medicine, and patients are being left to fend for themselves,\u201d said one 30-year-old. The coronavius\u2019s ability to spread appears to be getting stronger, the country\u2019s health commission minister has said. He added that the incubation period is one to 14 days and that unlike Sars, it is infectious during that period. The death toll from the outbreak has risen to 56, while authorities said almost 2,000 have been infected. Health experts believe the real number of cases to be higher, as hospitals across Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, have experienced shortages of testing kits. The US, France and Japan said they were arranging evacuation flights for people trapped in Wuhan, which has been placed under quarantine. The US and Japan each reported a new case, taking the number of people infected to three and four respectively. Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea each confirmed a new case, while Thailand said it had identified three new cases. The UK home secretary, Priti Patel, refused to confirm or deny reports that Britain is planning to evacuate more than 200 of its citizens in Wuhan. The foreign office has advised against travel to Hubei province. A nationwide ban on trading wildlife has been imposed in China after experts warned that the sale of sometimes endangered species for human consumption is the cause both of the new coronavirus outbreak and other past epidemics. Long-distance buses have been suspended in the eastern province of Shandong, which has a population of 100 million people. Long-distance buses have also been banned from departing from or arriving at Beijing and Shanghai. The financial hub of Shanghai, which has extensive international air connections, on Sunday reported its first death: that of an 88-year-old man who already had health problems. Beijing said that the reopening of schools and universities after the new year holiday had been indefinitely suspended. Two of Hong Kong\u2019s biggest attractions, Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park, announced they would close indefinitely. The city state reported its sixth case of coronavirus on Sunday. World Animal Protection has welcomed China\u2019s decision to impose a wildlife trade ban, effective from today. Kate Nustedt, the organisation\u2019s global wildlife director, said: We commend China\u2019s decision to impose a nationwide ban on wildlife trade in response to the deadly coronavirus outbreak. This ban will prevent the terrible suffering endured by millions upon millions of wild animals across the country. Crucially, it will also put a stop to the horrific conditions that serve as such a lethal hotbed of disease. We hope that this courageous step is made permanent and extended to all wildlife imports and exports, to help prevent any future crises of this nature. Wild animals belong in the wild. This wildlife trade ban by China will help keep them there. Thailand, the country with the most confirmed cases outside China of the new coronavirus, said on Sunday that three of the people infected were being treated and five had recovered and gone home. The public health minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, called an emergency meeting on Sunday, pledging: We can control the situation and are confident in our ability to handle the crisis. The Thai government has faced accusations that it is prioritising tourism - China is Thailand\u2019s biggest source of tourists with nearly 11 million visitors last year - over public health. The hashtag #crapgovernment was top trending on Twitter in Thailand on Saturday with more than 400,000 tweets. Users complained about the management of the virus and other health issues. Anutin insisted the government would not prioritise tourism revenue over health. If it reaches a point where public health is in danger, we will take (more) action ...Detecting infected patients is a good sign because it shows that our system is efficient. All but one of the eight cases in Thailand were tourists from Wuhan, the central Chinese city that is at the centre of the outbreak. One Thai national, who had visited Wuhan over the New Year, contracted the disease. There have been no cases of human-to-human transmission in Thailand. The government is scanning passengers arriving on flights from Guangzhou across five airports including the main Suvarnabhumi airport, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Don Muang and Krabi. Based on numbers during the Sars outbreak in 2003, three months of reduced travel from China would result in 50 billion baht ($1.52 billion) of lost tourism revenue, the minister of tourism and sports, Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn, said. Major shopping malls in Thai tourist spots have introduced hygiene measures. Mass transit operators including the Bangkok skytrain and subways are increasing the frequencies of wipedowns and spraying disinfectant in trains, the Transport Ministry said. China has withdrawn as host of the qualifiers for this year\u2019s Olympic football tournament for women. The pope has prayed for the victims of coronavirus, while praising China\u2019s response to the outbreak. From Reuters: \u201cI would like also to be close to and pray for the people who are sick because of the virus that has spread through China,\u201d Pope Francis told tens of thousands of people in St Peter\u2019s Square for his weekly message and blessing. \u201cMay the Lord welcome the dead into his peace, comfort families and sustain the great commitment by the Chinese community that has already been put in place to combat the epidemic,\u201d he said. Relations between the Vatican and Beijing have improved since September, 2018 when the two sides signed a historic pact on the naming of bishops. Conservative Catholics have objected to the pact, accusing the Vatican of having sold out to the communist government. Chinese associations in Paris cancelled Sunday afternoon\u2019s Chinese new year\u2019s parade in the centre of the city following the coronavirus epidemic. The mayor Anne Hidalgo said Paris\u2019s Chinese community was \u201cvery emotional and concerned\u201d so decided it was best for the parade not to go ahead. The city of Bordeaux also cancelled Chinese new year celebrations to limit infection risk and as a gesture of support for victims in China, the mayor said. France has identified three cases, currently being treated in hospital: two in Paris and one in Bordeaux. The French health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, said that she was expecting new cases to be detected in the country. She said that on Sunday morning five people were undergoing assessment in hospital, where they were isolated from others. She said a total of ten cases were under observation. The French prime minister will hold discussions with ministers on Sunday on measures to limit spread of the virus. AFP reports that some of the private cars on the road in Wuhan have been given special dispensation to travel to ferry the sick: Defying the threat from a contagious respiratory illness that broke out in the city and has killed dozens of people, Zhang Lin and other Wuhan residents are pitching in by driving sick fellow citizens to hospital. \u201cWe\u2019re from Wuhan, and even though you guys are here to help us, our own citizens should also come out to (help),\u201d Zhang Lin told AFP journalists as he waited for a patient to emerge from a clinic for the drive back home. \u201cThere has to be someone who does this.\u201d The 48-year-old Zhang and others have been enlisted by the government to provide the free service, and it is sorely needed. Wuhan has for days been the nucleus of a transport lockdown that began in the city of 11 million and has since been expanded to much of the rest of Hubei province, in an attempt to cut off transmission routes for the virus. Wuhan\u2019s public transport system has been halted, taxi services curtailed and, on Sunday, new restrictions were introduced banning most cars from the streets. Difficulty getting around adds another challenge for sick people who, even after they reach overwhelmed hospitals, may need to wait hours to see hard-pressed doctors. But drivers like Yin Yu have obtained special dispensation to drive for humanitarian reasons. \u201cThere are no cars, so we are responsible for sending them there ... and taking them back. This is all for free,\u201d said Yin, 40. A public announcement blaring from a loudspeaker in the city on Sunday offered tips on hygiene and seeking medical care, but also a dose of civic pride. \u201cWuhan is a city that dares to face difficulties and keeps overcoming them,\u201d said a female voice. \u201cThis is not the first time we have faced a similar situation. In 1998 we fought against extreme (Yangtze River) flooding. In 2003 we fought SARS,\u201d it said, referring to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a national viral epidemic similar to the current one. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way and have had great results!\u201d The FT\u2019s Tom Hancock says some people are flouting the lockdown in Wuhan. Another province of China, Hainan, has shut down all inter-province buses. It is the latest in a series of cities and provinces to take similar steps in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Japan is reporting its fourth case of the new coronavirus. The case was confirmed in a resident of Wuhan in his 40s who had arrived in Japan on 22 January on holidays, NHK said, citing the health ministry. The man was hospitalised in Aichi prefecture, central Japan, and tested positive for the virus, it said. Earlier today, Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said the country would evacuate any of its citizens in Wuhan who wished to return to Japan. Here is a full quote from the press conference today, from Ma Xiaowei, China\u2019s health commission minister. The transmissibility shows signs of increasing and the \u2018walking source of infection\u2019 [where patients have few signs of disease] has made it difficult to control and prevent the disease. For this new coronavirus we have not identified the source of the infection and we are not clear about the risk of its mutation and how it spreads. Since this is a new coronavirus there might be some changes in the coming days and weeks, and the danger it poses to people of different ages is also changing. The semi-autonomous region of Macau has imposed new restrictions on vistitors from mainland China, AFP\u2019s Hong Kong correspondent reports. Hubei province has suspended inter-province and inter-city buses intensifying the lockdown designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Chinese state media is reporting. Shandong province and the cities of Beijing, Tianjin an Xi\u2019an had earlier suspended inter-city and chartered buses from crossing their borders. In Hong Kong, residents are protesting about the construction of a quarantine camp for people infected with the coronavirus. The reference in the first tweet to yellow and blue, alludes to the colours adopted by supporters of the city\u2019s protest movement against Chinese interference and those who suppport the police, respectively. The BBC\u2019s China correspondent paints a vivid picture of life inside Hubei province in this video: The prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, has said the country will evacuate any of its citizens in Wuhan who wish to return to Japan. Beijing is postponing the reopening date of the city\u2019s kindergartens, schools and universities, China National Radio is reporting (via Reuters). The UK home secretary, Priti Patel, refused to confirm or deny reports that Britain is planning an airlift of its citizens from China. She would only tell Sophy Ridge on Sunday, on Sky News: \u201cWe are looking at all options.\u201d The UK foreign office has advised citizens against all travel to Hubei province. Hong Kong has reported a sixth case, according to AFP\u2019s correspondent in the city state. A third case of coronavirus has been identified in the United States. The latest case is in Orange County, Southern California. The Orange County Health Care Agency announced the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed a traveler from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, tested positive for the virus. The patient is in isolation at a hospital and in good condition, a release from the agency said. That patient had been in contact with the local health agency and was provided guidance to reduce exposure to others while health officials awaited laboratory confirmation. After consulting with the CDC and the California Department of Public Health, the Orange County agency will follow up with people who have had close contact with the patient. Guidance from the CDC advises that people who have had casual contact with the patient are at minimal risk for developing infection. There\u2019s no evidence that person-to-person transmission occurred in Orange County, and the risk of local transmission remains low, the release said. The previous two cases in the US were in Chicago and Washington state. Taiwan has further tightened restrictions on visitors from China to prevent the spread of a new coronavirus, suspending entry for many apart from business travellers and a few other exceptions like people married to Taiwanese, Reuters reports. Taiwan has already stopped Chinese tour groups from visiting, and has now banned all people from Hubei from coming to the island. Most other Chinese citizens will not be allowed in for the time being, aside from people involved in fighting the virus or on humanitarian grounds, the island\u2019s newly established Central Epidemic Command Centre said in a statement. Chinese business travellers will also be permitted entry, but have to agree to have their health monitored for two weeks after entry, the command centre said. Spouses from Hubei will have to stay in quarantine at home for the same period, it said. Chinese students studying in Taiwan will have to postpone their return to the island for two weeks, it added, while students from Hubei cannot return at all until further notice. China\u2019s national health minister Ma Xiaowei said the new coronavirus is also infectious during incubation, which is different from Sars. He said authorities\u2019 knowledge of the new virus was limited and they are unclear on the risks posed by mutations of the virus. The press conference ended with a promise to live up to \u201cthe expectations of the people\u201d and to increase transparency. To that end, they said there would be a press conference every morning. I will now be handing over to my colleague Haroon Siddique in London who will be covering the latest updates on the outbreak At a press conference by the State Council Information Office of China, they confirmed that there have been 2,057 cases of coronavirus globally. China\u2019s national health minister Ma Xiaowei said that it is possible the pathogen causing the virus came from a wild animal, and that 1,600 medical professionals were being dispatched to Wuhan to help handle the rising number of cases. Ma admitted that the virus\u2019s ability to spread seemed to be getting stronger and that they were not clear about the risks of the virus mutating. The incubation period is between 1 and 14 days, he said, and said it was likely the number of cases would continue to rise. The markets watchdog, agricultural ministry, and forestry bureau said in a joint statement that China has banned wildlife trade nationwide in markets, supermarkets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms due to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reports. Any places that breed wildlife should be isolated, and the transportation of wildlife should be banned, said the statement. The ban will take effect from Sunday. The US Embassy in China has confirmed it is making arrangements to relocate people working at the US Consulate General in Wuhan. There is a flight due to fly from Wuhan to San Francisco on Tuesday but the embassy warned that not all US citizens would be able to board. \u201cIf there is insufficient ability to transport everyone who expresses interest, priority will be given to individuals at greater risk from coronavirus,\u201d the embassy said in a statement on their website. Hong Kong now has a sixth confirmed case of coronavirus. According to reports, the patient, who was admitted to Ruttonjee Hospital in Wan Chai district of Hong Kong, had recently travelled to Wuhan on a high speed train before returning to Hong Kong Some more pictures from the news wire. Local state media is now reporting that the city of Shantou will now not be banning cars, ships and people from entering the city tomorrow but will instead strengthen disease controls such as disinfection efforts. This contradicts earlier statements by the local government, which have now been removed from Shantou city\u2019s website In a bid to contain the spread of the virus, China has banned long distance buses between several major cities, including Beijing. The eastern Shandong province, with a population of 100 million people, will suspend long-distance buses entering the province, state broadcaster CCTV reported, following the announcement of similar measures in the cities of Tianjin, Beijing and the historic Xi\u2019an. Authorities have confirmed that China\u2019s coastal city of Shantou in Guangdong province, over 500 miles away from Wuhan, will be the next city to be put on lockdown to control the spread of coronavirus. People, cars and ships will all be banned from entering Shantou from first thing Monday, and this afternoon all buses, taxis and ferries were suspended in the city. There are now 15 partially or fully locked down cities but Shantou is the first outside Hubei province to be placed under restrictions. This footage from AFP captures how Wuhan, a city of 11 million, has become a ghost town as the new restrictions on vehicles are imposed and people have confined themselves to their homes We have a interesting insight into how the outbreak first affected people in Wuhan as a local woman tells us how she contracted the virus after eating near the now infamous market in the city. This liveblog is now moving from Australia (where it\u2019s Australia Day, somewhat controversially) to India, where it\u2019s Republic Day. My colleague in New Delhi, Hannah Ellis-Petersen, is taking over. You can correspond with her by the usual channels. My best, Ben. The state-run People\u2019s Daily newspaper says China has started to develop a vaccine for 2019-nCoV, the novel coronavirus that has so far claimed 56 lives across the country and infected another 2000. The paper also reports the Chinese government has sent 450 military medical staff, including many with experience dealing with the Sars and Ebola outbreaks, to the epicentre of the pandemic in Wuhan. More from Australia (where your current correspondent is): Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister Marise Payne has said the Australian government is working with Chinese authorities to \u201cconsider possible assistance with travel for Australians from areas that are affected by Chinese travel restrictions\u201d. \u201cGiven the circumstances of the spread of the coronavirus, Chinese authorities are currently imposing very tight restrictions on all travel from Hubei. We are seeking advice from the Chinese authorities on these restrictions and whether any options are available to international travellers.\u201d Other countries, including the US and France, are putting into place plans to evacuate their citizens. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer has warned it is likely there will be more cases of the coronavirus in the country, following confirmation of four cases. Professor Brendan Murphy said he would be sending out a message to GPs across the country on how to handle patients who present with symptoms of the deadly illness. Three men are in hospital in Sydney after flying in from China, while another man in his 50s is being treated in Melbourne. All have a direct link to Wuhan, having either visited the city recently or been in direct contact with a confirmed case from that city. Coronavirus has killed 56 people in China and the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, remains in lockdown. More than 2,000 people in China have been infected. Cases have also been confirmed in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Singapore, Vietnam, France and Malaysia. \u201cThere is no cause for general concern,\u201d Murphy told reporters in Melbourne on Sunday. \u201cI would not be surprised if there are some more cases ... it\u2019s highly likely that we may see them some more. \u201cWe are incredibly well-prepared to isolate and deal with that.\u201d More details on countries trying to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan city and from Hubei province. The US government is flying its personnel out, directly to San Francisco, with a limited capacity for other Americans most at risk from coronavirus. From AP: The US consulate in the epidemic-stricken Chinese city of Wuhan will evacuate its personnel and some private citizens aboard a charter flight Tuesday. A notice Sunday from the embassy in Beijing said there would be limited capacity to transport US citizens on the flight that will proceed directly to San Francisco. It said that in the event there are not enough seats, priority will be given to to individuals \u201cat greater risk from coronavirus\u201d, a new respiratory disease that has sickened 1,975 people and killed 56, almost all in Wuhan. China\u2019s travel restrictions to restrict the spread of coronavirus appear to be widening further. At least 13 cities, covering 36 million people, are already living under lockdowns and travel restrictions. Now reports are emerging that the city of Shantou in Guangdong Province, population 5.3 million, will be put on lockdown. Starting at 2pm local time on Saturday, buses, ferries, and taxi services will cease. From Monday (27 January) no cars, boats or people will be allowed into the city, except for emergency purposes. Shantou is more than 800km from Wuhan, the epicentre of the pandemic. China\u2019s second-largest city Shanghai, now has 40 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Asian stock markets have so far taken a bit of a hit from concerns about the coronavirus. There were some steep losses on Chinese and Hong Kong markets especially, but nothing to upset the global equilibrium so far. The Dow Jones industrial average is only around 400 points of its all-time high of 29,369 earlier this month. That could change on Monday when markets reopen after a weekend that has seen the outbreak worsen in China and spread to Europe and Australia. However, Chinese markets will be closed all week for the lunar new year so will be insulated from any losses for now. If history is any guide, and somewhat extraordinarily, global pandemics appear to have little impact on markets: Hong Kong has declared a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The city has reported five confirmed cases of coronavirus: all of those patients have direct links to Wuhan. Health authorities say there are a further 122 patients being treated as potentially having the disease. The city\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam said her government had cancelled Lunar New Year\u2019s celebrations, and that it would close primary and secondary schools for two further weeks beyond the new year holiday. Schools will reopen 17 February. Lam said all direct flights and trains from Wuhan would be blocked from entering Hong Kong. France and a major car manufacturer said Saturday that they are moving to get citizens out of a locked-down Chinese city where a deadly outbreak of a new virus originated and has spread worldwide. French automaker PSA Group says it will evacuate its employees and their families from Wuhan in central China, quarantine them in another major Chinese city and then bring them back to France. The Foreign Ministry said French officials were studying \u201ceventual options\u201d for all its nationals to leave if they wish. It comes a day after France announced three cases of the new virus were being treated in two French hospitals, the first confirmed cases in Europe. All the patients are Chinese nationals who had recently returned from China. Other countries have made similar moves. The United States is preparing to evacuate its consular staff and citizens from Wuhan. About 1,000 US citizens are estimated to be in Wuhan. The US consulate in the city is closed and all diplomats have been ordered to leave. The logistics of how the Americans will leave, where they will go and what will be allowed by Chinese authorities, is currently being worked through by the US State Department, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. AFP have filed a few pictures from Wuhan, which has been in lockdown for several days. Chinese president Xi Jinping says his country faces a \u201cgrave situation\u201d in tackling the escalating coronavirus crisis. He has called for a greater centralisation of containment efforts, and increasing government control. \u201cLife is of paramount importance. When an epidemic breaks out, a command is issued. It is our responsibility to prevent and control it,\u201d Xi told a meeting of the standing committee of the political bureau of the Chinese Communist party, according to state-run Xinhua news agency. The World Health Organization has not altered its alert level for 2019-nCoV From the BBC\u2019s Stephen McDonell, who is in Hubei province: (Australian readers will remember Stephen from his long service with the ABC...) From the BBC\u2019s Stephen McDonnell: deserted streets in Hubei province Sunday has brought an increase in the proportion of deaths outside of Hubei province, the epicentre of the pandemic. State media is reporting that Shanghai has recorded its first death, as well as Henan province. Tianjin city has announced it will shut all inter-provincial shuttle buses from 27 January (Monday) to curb the coronavirus outbreak. State media in China is now reporting the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak is 56. All of the known deaths from the virus have occurred within China. Nearly 2,000 cases have been confirmed, and there are another 2,600 suspected cases. To Canada next where health officials in Toronto have added a slight qualification to their initial statements saying that they had a confirmed case of novel coronavirus. They say the case is \u201cpresumptive\u201d which means they\u2019re waiting for definitive lab tests after initial tests at a provincial lab showed it was the virus. Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre had said on Saturday night local time that it was caring for a man is his 50s who had recently flown from Wuhan to Guangzhou and then on to Toronto on 23 January. \u201cHe really wasn\u2019t in Toronto very long. He wasn\u2019t feeling well. I think he was at home and the people that live with him are in self isolation,\u201d said Dr Barbara Yafe, Ontario\u2019s associated chief medical officer. But Eileen de Villa, head of the city\u2019s public health agency, said at a press conference in the last hour that \u201cWe have the first presumptive case confirmed of this novel coronavirus here.\u201d More on the latest figures on victims in China. The toll stood at 41 on Saturday but 13 fatalities have been added overnight to make 54 deaths so far. The Hubei health ministry says seven of the latest deaths were from that province with the remainder elsewhere in China, marking a rise in the proportion of deaths outside the epicentre region. There were also another 323 people infected, taking the nationwide total to more than 1,600. Only 46 of the new confirmed cases were in Hubei, the ministry said. Welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in China and around the world. These are the main developments today: Officials in China said on Sunday that the death toll has risen to 54 and the number of people infected is more than 1,600. Chinese president Xi Jinping says the country faces a \u201cgrave situation\u201d as it battle to contain the fast-spreading contagion. Lunar new year celebrations were subdued across China on Saturday with an estimated 50 million people subject to travel restrictions in the epicentre Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province. The outbreak has spread to many other Asian countries and three other continets with cases confirmed in Australia, France and the United States. A man in his 50s was confirmed as the first case in Canada on Saturday night. He had recently flown from Wuhan to Guangzhou in southern China and then on to Toronto on 23 January. The British Foreign Office has advised citizens against all travel to Hubei province. French carmaker PSA, which makes brands including Peugeot and Citroen, on Saturday said it would repatriate expat staff from the Wuhan region where it has 38. Researchers are racing to work out if infections have been caused by animal to human contact, which would limit the spread, or whether the majority are being caused by human to human transmission. Li Bin, vice minister at the national health commission, will hold a media conference in Beijing about the outbreak at 3pm local time today.",

      "bodyText": "When you think of the northern rivers, you probably think of Byron Bay. Yes, the town has surfing, whale watching and even now a Hemsworth among its attractions. But the others towns in the region, even the small ones, have all of Byron\u2019s charm \u2013 with less traffic. From spirits (the drinking kind) and spirituality, crystals and candles to wilderness areas, beautiful beaches and one of the country\u2019s favourite museums, there\u2019s something for all, whether you\u2019re day-trippers from Queensland, weekenders from Sydney or visiting for longer from further afield. To fly to the northern rivers, the best options are Coolangatta airport on the Gold Coast or its smaller counterpart Ballina airport. The area is accessible by public transport thanks to the North Coast railway line combined with buses. Or make your holiday a road trip \u2013 you\u2019ll probably want a car to get around, even if you hire one along the way. Murwillumbah Start your journey at The Modern Grocer cafe, which has a large northern rivers wall map to help you plan your trip. The Tweed Regional Gallery and Margaret Olley Art Centre is a must and has been voted one of Australia\u2019s best museums. Its balcony also offers sweeping views of Mount Warning (Wollumbin). The mountain\u2019s traditional owners, the Bundjalung people, are now asking bushwalkers to reconsider climbing to the summit. Rather, hike the shorter trail in the world heritage-listed Wollumbin national park and head to Mavis\u2019s Kitchen at the mountain\u2019s foot to enjoy organically grown food. New Govardhana, an idyllic Hare Krishna farm, hosts Bhakti yoga classes and free temple feasts every Sunday. \u201cPeople from all walks of life can experience Krishna consciousness without having to radically change one\u2019s lifestyle,\u201d says Mukunda Goswami, an early pioneer of the movement who has lived in the area for decades. Stay on the farm or head back into town to the award-winning YHA on the Tweed River. Brunswick Heads When you ask the locals why they love \u201cBruns\u201d, some say because \u201cit\u2019s the next Byron\u201d, others say \u201cbecause it\u2019s not Byron\u201d. What they have in common is their passion for the town, which provided the setting for the fictional Pearl Bay in the latest SeaChange series. The landmarks featured include the Fisherman\u2019s Co-op, the bridge where the turquoise river connects to the sea, and the Billinudgel Hotel (although it\u2019s about 7km away from Brunswick town). Back in town and across the road from the river, the Hotel Brunswick draws visitors into its poinciana-shaded beer garden. Brunswick is a great spot for families. It boasts a wide selection of water activities and even a \u201cfairy trail\u201d. For adults there\u2019s skydiving, horse riding and hot air ballooning. You can also take in a circus, standup show, cabaret or movie at the restored Brunswick Picture House, a charming white building with red neon lights. If you\u2019re prepared to spend a lot on dinner, and plan it three months in advance, book in at one of Australia\u2019s most celebrated restaurants, Fleet. The 14-seater has a changing menu featuring local ingredients \u2013 think smoked mullet, crispy-skin potato and dill, with turmeric margaritas. The Sails Motel has rooms with a cheerful Palm Springs vibe from $125 per night. Bangalow Back in the 80s, Bangalow was probably best known for the shop Abracadabra with its TV jingle: \u201cAbracadabra right on the highway, west of Byron Bay, the biggest bunch of baskets under the sun, come in and say g\u2019day.\u201d The \u201chappy hippy shop\u201d is still there, selling boho dresses, incense, prayer flags and more, but Bangalow is now more hipster than hippie. Ninbella is a gallery on the main street showcasing revered First Nations artists including Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri and Emily Kame Kngwarreye, as well as several artists from the northern rivers. Town Restaurant and Cafe, which has a seven-course degustation menu, keeps collecting awards, so you might want to book in advance. If you feel like cooking yourself, pick up produce at the Bangalow market \u2013 one of the region\u2019s most popular growers\u2019 markets. They\u2019re held on the fourth Sunday of every month at the town\u2019s showgrounds. Sleep at 90 Byron Street, a heritage-listed house with eclectic decor from around the world. Six kilometres south of Bangalow, Harvest has racked up awards and put the pretty village of Newrybar, with a population of 500, on the map. The restaurant employs a forager and wild food researcher, who unearths underused ingredients to make dishes such as local rainbow trout with native spiced broth, bok choy, kohlrabi and finger lime. It\u2019s worth booking ahead. Lennox Head Move over Gold Coast: Lennox Head is a surfer\u2019s paradise, attracting wave chasers from all around the globe. Climb the steps to the Pat Morton lookout where you may spot a dolphin, or if you visit between May and November, a whale. The tea tree-infused water of Lake Ainsworth makes for a magical swimming spot with a healing history: Bundjalung women once bathed in the water after giving birth. It\u2019s also a superb spot for canoeing, paddleboarding, kayaking and floating. Penny Lane is great for brunch, with its French toast with smashed berries and whipped ricotta. The Point Cafe is popular for its coffee and smoothies, and Lennox Gelato &amp; Coffee Co has the best ice cream in town. To stay, Lake Ainsworth Sport and Recreation Centre offers self-contained cottages, lodges and villas. Cabarita The good-humoured locals of Cabarita have a curious beach plaque that states: \u201cAt this precise spot, on the morning of December 12, 1927, nothing of significance is known to have occurred.\u201d The Bundjalung people, on basalt stone artwork on the main street, declare that Cabarita \u201cis as it\u2019s always been\u201d. But the town is making waves. Most recently its beach was picked as the best in Australia for 2020 by \u201cbeach ambassador\u201d (yes it\u2019s a job) Brad Farmer. The long white stretch of sand has swathes of towel space, even during the holiday season, so it\u2019s a relief for those who don\u2019t love crowds. Lap up the scenery that was featured in the film Aquaman on one of Journey Outdoors in Nature\u2019s candlelit full-moon canoe trips, or on a kayak with Watersports Guru, paddling from Cabarita Lake through to Kingscliff. While the beautiful, high-cost Halcyon House and its accompanying restaurant Paper Daisy have won dozens of design and dining awards, a stay at The Beach, which is a stone\u2019s throw from the Surf Life Saving Club, is less than half the price. Mullumbimby Inland, surrounded by green hills, the \u201cbiggest little town in Australia\u201d lives up to its name. \u201cMullum\u201d, as it\u2019s also known, is a cultural melting pot. Family-run Yaman Mullumbimby whip up a mean fawaffle (a cross between a falafel and a waffle) and other dishes from Yemen and the Middle East. If you need a sugar hit, the Mullumbimby Chocolate Shop brings a local flavour to the classic small-town sweet store, thanks to vegan rocky road, vegan lolly lucky dips and chocolates shaped like surfer boys. The highlight though, 10km from town at Montecollum, is the bedazzling Crystal Castle and Shambhala Gardens. Not your average crystal collection, it boasts the world\u2019s tallest crystals, two 5.5 metre geodes, and a 120 million-year-old crystal cave, perfect for a selfie. \u201cThey amaze even the most experienced crystal fans,\u201d says owner Naren King, who has sourced them over the past three decades from as far afield as Uruguay. Should you require further healing, visit The Kiva Spa, not far from The Middle Pub, which also has accommodation. Tumbulgum On the weekend it\u2019s hard to move for all the visitors who come from interstate to Tumbulgum to waterski and fish. The Tumbulgum Tavern, the Tweed\u2019s oldest, displays a portrait of the area\u2019s 800 pound groper which was caught in 1828. These days the quaint village is the home of Ink Gin, the world\u2019s first natural colour-changing gin, thanks to a butterfly pea flower, and Australia\u2019s only rhum agricole. Watch the magic of the gin for yourself and sample one during a Husk Distillers tour. Cubby Bakehouse at Chinderah is about 12km away and is worth the trip for its sweets (think fairy bread macarons) and what they claim are \u201cthe bloody best baguettes this side of Paris\u201d. It\u2019s a huge call from Cubby, but they are pretty good. A number of companies including Mount Warning Tours offer cruises of the area. Hotel options are limited, but you can find Tumbulgum accommodation on Airbnb. Nimbin The town of Nimbin is Australia\u2019s alternative lifestyle capital and \u201cthe last stop on the bus for many people\u201d, says activist Michael Balderstone, the founder of the Nimbin Hemp Embassy, where you can sip a hemp frappuccino. There\u2019s more to Nimbin than drugs. A highlight is the Nimbin Candle Factory. Their hand-dipped creations are sold through independent grocers and health food shops, but they also keep \u201cwitches, wizards, goddesses and pagans\u201d in business, says co-owner and treechanger Lisa Fry. On the other side of the town\u2019s former butter factory is the Bush Theatre with its Mulgum Studio, a comfortable place to crash overnight. The Nimbin Bowlo, which must have the best signage of any bowling club in Australia, is a must-see. Around the corner is one of the town\u2019s best-kept secrets, the free swimming pool.",

They weren\u2019t real! I didn\u2019t know them! \u2013 but can, in fact, serve a real world purpose. David Kessler, a grief expert, <a href=\"https://www.tvinsider.com/55865/how-tv-deaths-are-changing-the-way-we-grieve/\">told TV Insider</a> that TV deaths can help people grapple with mortality and loss in their own lives. \u201cAny consistent exposure we can get to a loss of life not in our family can help us to begin to understand the real thing when it does happen to us,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Similarly, TV deaths can echo our own experiences, and often dredge up emotions that we\u2019d done our best to bury. A beloved TV mum\u2019s passing may remind us of our own bereavement.

      "bodyText": "It was bad luck any way you look at it. You\u2019re Jarrod \u201cToadfish\u201d Rebecchi, you\u2019ve finally married the definitely out-of-your-league Dee Bliss, and while you\u2019re fanging down a country road in your hotted-up beige station wagon, you decide to steal a sneaky pash with your wife. And then the car goes flying off a cliff, sending your beloved to a watery grave. For keen Neighbours viewers in 2003, this untimely end for Dee \u2013 and accompanying cruel twist of fate for Toadie, who had finally caught a lucky break \u2013 had us glued to screens, and then to our phones, watercoolers and boxes of tissues. (We naturally had no idea that in 13 years\u2019 time, Dee would return from the dead. Nor that she\u2019d be a twin separated at birth with the mysterious Andrea. But that\u2019s Neighbours for you.) As the credits rolled, I paced around the living room trying to wrap my head around the cruelty of following this happy moment with such a tragedy. How could they bring this odd but perfect couple together, only to turf them into a mysterious inland ocean? I was not yet wise to this classic storytelling bait and switch: the mastermind behind Dee\u2019s demise, Shane Porteous, was awarded the Australian Writers\u2019 Guild gong for best episode in a television serial. Dee\u2019s was merely one in a long and agonising history of Australian television deaths that have broken the hearts of viewers nationwide since the demise of ringleader Judy in Seven Little Australians. There was Stingray, nodding off for good at his mum\u2019s birthday party on Ramsay Street. The godly Patrick from Offspring, surviving a car accident only to die before the birth of his and Nina\u2019s baby. Leukaemia-stricken Molly, A Country Practice\u2019s beloved farmer, drifting away into a fade-out as she watched her family play. And in perhaps the most devastating of recent memory, Love My Way\u2019s Lou falls off her scooter, never to wake. It feels like Australia particularly relishes in these deaths, but of course the phenomenon is a global one: I am, after all, a person who visited the Time &amp; Life building in New York to \u201cpour one out\u201d on the sidewalk for Lane Pryce when my favourite Mad Men character was snuffed out in 2012. Mourning a television character can seem ridiculous \u2013 Why am I crying? They weren\u2019t real! I didn\u2019t know them! \u2013 but can, in fact, serve a real world purpose. David Kessler, a grief expert, told TV Insider that TV deaths can help people grapple with mortality and loss in their own lives. \u201cAny consistent exposure we can get to a loss of life not in our family can help us to begin to understand the real thing when it does happen to us,\u201d he said. Similarly, TV deaths can echo our own experiences, and often dredge up emotions that we\u2019d done our best to bury. A beloved TV mum\u2019s passing may remind us of our own bereavement. TV deaths that involve particular diseases, substances, suicide or accidents may strike a particularly true chord. Many grief counsellors and psychologists agree: the emotions we feel when farewelling a beloved TV character are real and valid. \u201cHuman beings love stories and making connections, even if it\u2019s to fictional people. We create meaning and then experience actual grief when that connection is broken,\u201d Christine Manzella, who works in grief therapy, told Time magazine. This seems especially true of long-running soaps and dramas, as viewers often quite literally spend some time every day with those characters. And, as notable moments in television grief have demonstrated \u2013 such as the passing of Sesame Street\u2019s Mr Hooper \u2013 these storylines can even help people (particularly younger viewers) grapple with the idea of mortality in a \u201cteachable\u201d way. But as \u201cprestige television\u201d takes characters to meet their maker with increasing frequency (and, in the case of Game Of Thrones, increasing inventiveness), TV deaths may be losing their impact both dramatically and psychologically. As television critic Emily Todd VanDerWerff cautions: \u201cWe want to believe that our fictional characters will be mourned, even if they died in a sudden, random accident, because we hope that we, too, will be mourned.\u201d Perhaps, whether it\u2019s a watery end in an inland sea or a quiet fade-out in the backyard, that\u2019s why TV deaths give us pause: they remind us we\u2019re all on borrowed time.

      "bodyText": "The former Australian of the year Rosie Batty has said she is \u201cdismayed\u201d by a decision to award an Australia Day honour to the controversial writer and media commentator Bettina Arndt. Arndt, a journalist, author and sex therapist, was on Sunday made a Member of the Order of Australia, the third-highest rank in Australia\u2019s civic honours system, in an announcement that has drawn furious criticism from women\u2019s groups. Batty, a family violence campaigner who was the Australian of the Year in 2015, told Guardian Australia she found the decision to honour Arndt \u201cvery unhelpful\u201d, a view she believed most people working towards gender equality would share. \u201cI was completely shocked and then I was quite dismayed,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but wonder how it could be that somebody has been rewarded for work \u2026 that actually pits men against women.\u201d Much of the criticism around the decision to honour Arndt has centred around an interview she conducted with the Tasmanian man Nicolaas Bester, a convicted paedophile jailed for grooming and repeatedly raping his 15-year-old student when he was a 58-year-old. After being released from prison, Bester had boasted about his crimes on an internet forum in 2015, a move that prompted a second conviction. Two years later, Arndt posted a YouTube video called \u201cFeminists persecute disgraced teacher\u201d in which she interviewed Bester. In the video, Arndt said some male teachers were vulnerable due to \u201csexually provocative behaviour from female students\u201d and could then be \u201csubject to false accusations if they reject or offend the young woman in question\u201d. She also said that young women needed to \u201cbehave sensibly and not exploit their seductive power to ruin the lives of men\u201d and in response to Bester\u2019s suggestion his crime was \u201cawesome\u201d, Arndt laughed, adding that it was \u201cpretty stupid\u201d but that \u201cI can imagine how easily this happens\u201d. Arndt has since apologised for the \u201crelaxed tone\u201d of the interview, while accusing 60 Minutes of selectively editing the video. \u201cI conducted the interview not because I condone his past behaviour but because I am concerned about vigilante justice,\u201d she wrote on her website in 2018. Bester\u2019s victim, Tasmanian woman Grace Tame, also criticised the decision to honour Arndt on Sunday, telling News Corp that she believed \u201chonouring someone who actively defended a paedophile on a public platform is a blatant example of the protracted, systemic moral corruption that still hampers our society\u201d. \u201cIt is precisely this manner of injustice that strengthens our collective courage and motivation as survivors to share our experiences,\u201d she told news.com.au. Guardian Australia has contacted Arndt for a response to Batty\u2019s comments. On Friday, she told Guardian Australia she was pleased to be acknowledged for her work, adding that the focus on her interview with Bester had \u201cmisrepresented\u201d her more than 45-year career. \u201cIf people are unhappy about my receiving an award because of the Bester issue, I suggest they acquaint themselves with the background to the video,\u201d Arndt said. \u201cPerhaps they should think about why this issue is being used to misrepresent my very long career. After all, I\u2019ve been out in the media for over 45 years promoting all sorts of controversial issues, seeking fair treatment for both men and women.\u201d Arndt was recognised for her \u201csignificant service to the community as a social commentator\u201d, the awards council said. The citation for her honour references a 2018 campus speaking tour, which was called the \u201cFake Rape Crisis\u201d tour. The End Rape on Campus Australia founder, Sharna Bremner, on Sunday labelled Arndt\u2019s honour a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to sexual assault survivors. Batty, meanwhile, likened it to Pauline Hanson\u2019s appointment as deputy chair of a Senate inquiry into family law, a development that has also drawn criticism from family violence groups. \u201cThese are controversial figures that \u2026 continue the backlash as we move towards gender equality,\u201d she said. Contacted by Guardian Australia on Sunday, the chairman of the Council for the Order of Australia, Shane Stone, said the council did not enter into a public discussion about the awards process.",

      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders emerged as the frontrunner in the two earliest Democratic 2020 nomination voting states this weekend, Iowa and New Hampshire, according to the latest polls \u2013 but Elizabeth Warren received a powerful boost with an endorsement from the Des Moines Register newspaper in what is still considered an open race. Warren had been slipping behind in Iowa, which holds the first vote in the nation with its caucuses just a week a way on 3 February, but the Register this weekend named her \u201cthe president this nation needs\u201d. Meanwhile, a surging Bernie Sanders, the original ultra-progressive in his runs for the White House in 2016 and 2020 elections, topped a new CNN and University of New Hampshire poll of likely Democratic primary voters in that state, released on Sunday, with 25% backing him \u2013 a considerable lead on former vice-president Joe Biden who was placed second with 16%. Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend mayor, was third with 15% and Massachusetts senator Warren behind him with just 12%. Sanders, who won the state by more than 20 points in the primaries four years ago, has gained four points since October and Warren has dropped six points in the same period. The state will vote in the Democratic primary on 11 February. Meanwhile, a Washington Post-ABC News national poll, also published on Sunday, showed Biden and Sanders have emerged nationally as breakaway leaders in the competition for the Democratic presidential nomination. It comes after a poll on Saturday also showed Vermont senator Sanders, 78, leading in Iowa, where Democrats will vote in the caucuses on 3 February. The New York Times/Siena College survey found him to be the first choice of 25% of voters \u2013 with Buttigieg in second with 18%, Biden at 17% and Warren at 15%. For Warren it represents a marked change from September, when a poll showed her leading the field in Iowa with 22% of the vote, and she suddenly finds herself the underdog among the leaders in the field. But despite this weekend\u2019s disappointing results, it was Warren who won the highly coveted endorsement of Iowa paper The Des Moines Register. In an editorial, published on Saturday, the paper said all of the remaining candidates \u201ccould make a fine president\u201d, but singled out Warren as \u201cthe best leader for these times\u201d. It said she \u201cis not the radical some perceive her to be. She was a registered Republican until 1996. She is a capitalist \u2026 But she wants fair markets, with rules and accountability. She wants a government that works for people, not one corrupted by cash.\u201d On the merits of her fellow candidates, the paper said Biden \u201cwould restore credibility in the White House and respect among allies around the world\u201d and praised Buttigieg\u2019s \u201crefreshingly smart, youthful optimism\u201d. It noted Minnesota senator and 2020 rival Amy Klobuchar\u2019s \u201ctrack record of bipartisan achievement\u201d and that Sanders \u201cmuch like Warren \u2026 champions the working class\u201d. But, it said, Warren is the best candidate for the job: \u201cWarren\u2019s competence, respect for others and status as the nation\u2019s first female president would be a fitting response to the ignorance, sexism and xenophobia of the Trump Oval Office\u2026At this moment, when the very fabric of American life is at stake, Elizabeth Warren is the president this nation needs.\u201d In response to the endorsement, which is arguably more valuable, especially at this stage, than that of the New York Times, which she received earlier this month in tandem with Klobuchar, she thanked the Des Moines Register on Twitter on Sunday, adding: \u201cIowans are ready to make big, structural change \u2013 and I\u2019m going to fight my heart out for everyone in Iowa and across the country.\u201d Sanders\u2019s campaign has surged in recent weeks \u2013 attracting the support of top progressives such as congresswoman Pramila Jayapal of Washington as well as key figure, New York congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who campaigned powerfully in Iowa on Friday \u2013 nominally for Sanders but in a performance that some saw more as, perhaps, an early 2024 promotion of her own potential run for the White House. The latest developments in the crucial races come after a highly publicised spat between Warren and Sanders over comments made in a private meeting in 2018 that resulted in Warren accusing Sanders of calling her a \u201cliar\u201d in hot mic comments on national television.",

I\u2019d just offer the context that it was for Bairstow, really, that Foakes lost his spot. It\u2019s only been since YJB lost his way with the bat that Buttler was given the gloves back.

Ten minutes remain until the tea interval is due. <br></p> <p>\u201cEngland in 1989 used 19 bowlers, of whom 15 took wickets,\u201d emails Ned Harrison. That was a 6 test series, though the 15 bowlers shared only 65 wickets between them (happy days). I think the most wicket takers in a 4 test series is 13 (West Indies v England 1929/30 and England v New Zealand in a 3 test series in 1937).

Careful now.</p> <p>\u201cThanks for the mention Rob,\u201d says William Ellen. \u201cRegarding QdK, a lot depends on the known unknowns. Whether he can increase his hunger for Test runs, whether he can get through those spells when the bowlers are on top and when conditions are adverse, and whether South Africa find a top five capable of setting up the innings the way the Aussies often did for Gilchrist. But the potential is there for legendary status. It will be interesting to see how he gets on as ODI captain.

Where do you think he\u2019s currently at in the wicketkeeper-batsman\u2019s pantheon? He\u2019s clearly staggeringly talented, with a Gilchrist-like ability to slice an attack to death a la the Game of Thrones character Sword of the Morning. But he also has an uncanny ability to get himself out. For example the first innings of the last Test, at the start of the day having just seen Philander get castled playing a loose drive in the previous over, he played exactly the same shot to his third ball of the day.\u201d</p> <p>He reminds me a bit of Stokes the batsman: he will always play matchwinning innings because of his talent, but lacks the concentration and ruthlessness of the remorselessly consistent. I suppose if anyone can instil those in him, it\u2019ll be Jacques Kallis. At this stage I\u2019d put him among the second tier of modern keeper-batters in Test cricket, with Gilchrist, Andy Flower and maybe AB de Villiers (I can\u2019t remember, did he play enough games as keeper?) at the top table. But he has the ability to finish with a career average in the high 40s.

I think that all possible misdemeanours should be judged against: 1) was it premeditated 2) was it done to attempt to gain competitive advantage.

Even the pessimists think this is a done deal. England were so dominant yesterday that it\u2019s hard to see anything other than a third consecutive victory. If that happens, it will be the first time since the 1954-55 Ashes that England have come from behind to win an overseas series 3-1. </p> <p>Then, as now, one of the stars was an injury-prone fast bowler. Mark Wood doesn\u2019t sledge people by quoting Wordsworth, as Frank Tyson did, but they do have the same appetite for destruction and ability to bowl in excess of 95mph. And although his record is nowhere near as good - Tyson averaged 18.56 from his 17 Tests - Wood\u2019s performances since his recall in St Lucia last year have evoked the mythical devastation of Tyson in that Ashes series.</p> <p>It\u2019s a small sample size, for sure, but 12 wickets at 14.75 is eyecatching stuff. He was far too hot for South Africa yesterday, taking three of the six wickets that fell in the evening session, and he\u2019ll be eyeing another five-for this morning. South Africa will resume on 88 for six, still 312 runs behind in a match they need to win. It\u2019s a long way back from here.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-26T07:44:32.809Z\">at 7.44am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Stocks on Woakes. Words from Collingwood. \u201cJob done,\u201d is the assessment of Alastair Cook. Even though it wasn\u2019t a particularly convincing performance - especially from those who needed runs, not least Buttler - they are so far ahead in this Test Match that it doesn\u2019t matter an awful lot. When we return tomorrow morning it\u2019ll be England\u2019s fresh bowlers striving to finish this off in style. Until then, thanks for your company. Bye! With just four minutes remaining, stumps are called on the third day. After batting again instead of enforcing the follow-on, England added 248 across two sessions. South Africa have two days to make 466. On paper, at least. In reality, their job is to hold on for long as they can and hope that rain might help them out. What a catch! du Plessis has taken a blinder at gully, the captain giving full-stretch with his right hand and puling in a blinder. It gives Hendricks a five-wicket bag on debut, finishing with 5/64. Fantastic work. South Africa\u2019s target is 466. 61st over: England 248-9 (Root 58, Broad 1) Broad\u2019s off the mark first ball, giving Root three swings at Pretorius... and he NAILS the second of them, SMASHING HIM INTO THE SECOND DECK at midwicket! That\u2019ll do. He keeps the strike, too. Wood\u2019s on the move before the ball is bowled but Pretorius is on target, bowling him around his legs. Of greater amusement is Root\u2019s frustration at how long Broad is taking to reach to middle. We have nine minutes left until the close of play. 60th over: England 239-8 (Root 50, Wood 18) Hendricks to Wood and he goes BANG over midwicket to start the new over, smashing him into the advertising boards. He tries to do the same again but finds the sweeper. Root tries to get in on the act, dancing down the track and swinging for the pickets... but doesn\u2019t make contact. He\u2019s better off standing still as he does to the next offering, timing a gorgeous cover drive through the gap for four. That\u2019ll make a lovely photo, making contact with the ball as his back knee touched the turf. With another single to finish, England\u2019s captain moves to another half-century from his 90th ball in the middle. That\u2019s a 50 in both innings and his 65th score above 50 in Test cricket. 59th over: England 229-8 (Root 45, Wood 13) There we go! 15 from Pretorius\u2019 over, Wood once again providing the entertainment. Not quite as emphatic as yesteday with his Maxwell-esque slaps over point, but two outside edges give him two boundaries. I\u2019m probably being unfair with the first of those - was more a steer. TV tells us that he has 90 runs for the series (once out) and a bowling average of 13. From Joachim Demnitz. \u201cMy wife: 5/5, Me: 6/6, our son: 9/9, our daughter due: 11/11 but because of a mix-up of scanning pictures the doctors recommended and indeed delivered by caesarian on 19/11.\u201d Missed it by that much! Adam Hirst, too: \u201cEngland seem to be playing this like a 4-day test? Hitting out to get quick runs before a declaration and an hour to bowl. I think they want an extra day off at the finish of the series.\u201d Home a day early after a massive night out, I suspect... usually the incentive. 58th over: England 214-8 (Root 41, Wood 3) Will Mark Wood add to his tally of sixes? He smacked five last week and three in the first innings. Until then, he only had eight in his entire First Class career. Nup, not here: Hendricks looks to have learned his lesson yesterday about feeding him in his slot outside the off-stump. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hi, Eva Maaten. \u201cI love the way the OBO gets hijacked by fascinating, though cricket unrelated topics! My grandmother was born on 18.9, my mother on 17.9, my sister on 16.9. I was supposed to arrive on 12.9. but decided to be early (8.9) and nd my daughter was due on 22.2.02. She didn\u2019t fancy that date, though. Greetings from the sunny and pleasant Wanderers.\u201d You\u2019re right, this has been fun! On the same theme, Ant Pease has an solution for us. \u201cTo answer Chris McMillan, the chance of two people sharing a birthday in 1/365, so the chance of them both sharing that with another person is (1/365)^2 or about 1 in 133,000.\u201d Brian Withington had a go at it too: \u201cIgnoring leap years and assuming only one child born in generations two and three, I make the odds of all three generations sharing the same birthday some 133,224-1. The first birthday is a given so we are only talking about squaring 365 and subtracting 1.\u201d Great work, both of you. 57th over: England 209-8 (Root 40, Wood 0) Well, if Root is going to declare - and let\u2019s assume he needs to do it in the next couple of overs to make it worthwhile tonight - it didn\u2019t look like it during this Pretorius over. Three from it. \u201cWhy do England persist with Jos Buttler in the Test team and overlook Ben Foakes?\u201d asks John Graham. \u201cWhat did Foakes do wrong?\u201d I have a few emails like this. I\u2019d just offer the context that it was for Bairstow, really, that Foakes lost his spot. It\u2019s only been since YJB lost his way with the bat that Buttler was given the gloves back. I share your view about Foakes. I would have kept all three in there at the point when he was doing so well. They are a fair way from being able to justify that now though, the other two both out of runs. \u201cNight shift in Australia and thank God there\u2019s the blog to follow.\u201d Great to have you with us, Scott Probst. \u201cI\u2019ve got to admit I\u2019m behind the news, but it was alarming to see musing earlier about South African cricket being in decline\u2026. I wouldn\u2019t have thought this was possible given the talent they seem to have at their disposal.\u201d Yes, there\u2019s going to be a lot of important words written about this over the next few months, I suspect. It\u2019s both sudden and serious. There\u2019s a lot going on. A little inside edge and that\u2019s Woakes gone second ball. Hendricks has four. This has been a most commendable perfomance from the entire South African attack. 56th over: England 206-8 (Root 38) Fun while it lasted. Curran was given a bouncer and there was never any doubt about him taking it on with just one man out there for it. But he\u2019s picked out that fielder, slotting a top-edged hook straight down the throat of Patterson. 55th over: England 205-6 (Root 38, Curran 35) Pretorius returns and Curran is very keen on that, getting down the wicket and slapping him through the line with contempt. He\u2019s 35 from 26 balls and batting like a dream. Earlier in the over, England reached 200 and pushed their lead beyond the highest successful fourth innings chase of 418, which the West Indies made against Australia in 2003. Ian Forth returning to an earlier topic: \u201cA parachuted then dropped X!: Carberry, Lathwell, Balderstone, David Smith, Chris Cowdrey, Hamilton, Read, Selvey, Borthwick, Pattinson, Rankin.\u201d From an Australian perspective, I\u2019d throw Callum Ferguson and Joe Mennie in. Both were brought in for the Hobart all-out 80 debacle, never to be seen again. 54th over: England 198-6 (Root 36, Curran 30) Another delightful Curran boundary, hammering Hendricks\u2019 first delivery through midwicket. It wasn\u2019t even that short; he\u2019s just so organised square of the wicket. With that in the bank, they are happy collecting runs around the field for the rest as though we\u2019re watching an ODI. It increasingly looks like they are going to pull the trigger on this declaration. A note from Scott Roberts on Jos. \u201cYou took the words right out of my fingers with your analysis of how Jos should play in this situation, one which should be tailormade for him to perform in a free, Gilchrist-esque attacking mode. Like you, though, I suspect that Jos knows he\u2019s playing for his place, which is something I assume Gilchrist never had to worry about.\u201d Is there anything wrong with simply resting him for Sri Lanka? I mean, they will want Foakes for wicketkeeping reasons. Fair enough. They need Jos fresh for the T20 World Cup campaign - and he has the IPL in April and the home summer. If after all of that he can command a Test spot again as a specialist bat, then what a good result that would be. And if he can\u2019t, then is it that big a deal? 53rd over: England 190-6 (Root 35, Curran 23) Paterson has done plenty right at Root, beating his outside edge, finding his inside edge and generally making life difficult for him. But it comes to nothing. He goes up for a chat with the England skipper at the end of the over. Funnily enough, we can\u2019t hear it on stump mic. 52nd over: England 186-6 (Root 33, Curran 21) Sam Curran, everyone! Hendricks gives him a chance to swing his arms early in the over so he does just that, pulling four over midwicket, a couple of bounces before tricking over the rope. Later in the set he plays another lavish stroke off the back foot, Root-esque through extra cover with supreme timing. With it, England\u2019s lead moves beyond 400. Still some chance of a declaration tonight with 50 minutes left to play. I reckon they\u2019ll do it. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Gidday, Chris McMillan. \u201cWhilst we are talking about birth date anomalies, I wonder if I could crowd-source some stats work that I\u2019m too lazy to do myself? My son was 4 days short of being born on my birthday - which I share with my dad. What would the odds of 3 generations all being born on the same day?\u201d Very Sunday-arvo-third-innings-declaration-runs-OBO-areas, right there. Tom Whitaker on the same topic. \u201cMy best friend and I had our children within an hour of each other\u2019s. His son is 42 minutes older than my daughter. It\u2019s like a Pulp song.\u201d Beautiful. One of my best friends is due six weeks after we are; we know each other from indie dancefloors and have spent months saying to each other that in about 16 years there is a strong likelihood of Disco 2000 happening. 51st over: England 176-6 (Root 33, Curran 11) Paterson is straight into it again at Root, finding an inside edge that whacks him on the unprotected part of his back knee. That hurts. This isn\u2019t at all problematic for England in this match given their big first innings lead but this second innings really has been a scrap so far. \u201cAn OBO quiz question for a sleepy afternoon,\u201d writes Tom Bowtell. Okay, let\u2019s do it. \u201cWith so many members of the 10,000+ Test runs club retiring over the last few years, I was wondering which current player *who hasn\u2019t retired from Tests* has the most runs?\u201d Good question! It must be none other than the England captain, with Smith and Kohli both within 300-odd runs away from catching up to him. 50th over: England 172-6 (Root 31, Curran 9) Is that Sam Curran or Brian Lara? With just a tiny bit of length to worth with, he\u2019s slapping Nortje through cover with a straight blade, on the up. A beautiful stroke. But reinforcing that he isn\u2019t, indeed, Brian Charles (or anything like the finished product), he gets a fat outside edge from the next ball, lucky not to be walking off as a result of the loose shot. \u201cCentury in a session\u201d begins Andy Cox, grumpy what I forecast something special from Stokes when he came out batting like a dream. \u201cStop it - we\u2019ve got enough superstitious nonsense in English cricket without needing help from Australians! PS I love The Final Word, but any more of this commentators curse on our batters and I might have to consider some serious retaliation. Like unsubscribing. Or giving a 1-star rating. Or both. You\u2019ve been warned.\u201d Thanks, I think! As I\u2019ll always remind you what it comes to curses, it is Mitch Marsh who I have burned on the OBO and radio more than any other. Lucky for me, he\u2019s the best fella in cricket and doesn\u2019t have it in him to hold a grudge. 49th over: England 163-6 (Root 30, Curran 1) Curran is on a King Pair, of course. He\u2019s through that, defending Paterson into the legside. I know he\u2019s already 30, but there\u2019s quite a lot to like about the new seamer, isn\u2019t there? Very accurate, nice natural shape and has a quick enough bumper to keep things interesting. As for Slammin\u2019 Sam, he\u2019s off the mark and off his pair with one to backward point. Root has one ball to get through and he\u2019s pinged on the glove. Very good bowling. Before Jos fell, I was about to give you a Mac Millings offering. Let\u2019s go with it anyway. \u201cIn the 7th over of this innings, a certain Tom Parker said he couldn\u2019t rid himself of a \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 earworm, featuring \u2018Jos Buttler!\u2019 and \u2018I ain\u2019t \u2018fraid of Ben Foakes\u2019. I am here to help.\u201d Let it rip... If there\u2019s Nass Hussain in your \u201cNeigh!\u201d Mark Wood, Younis Bonnor Hall? Jos Buttler! Griffith Lumb Singh Beard Pandit don\u2019t Cook Wood Younis Bonnor Hall? Jos Buttler! I ain\u2019t \u2018fraid of Ben Foakes I ain\u2019t \u2018fraid of Ben Foakes Gifford, Lee &amp; Singh Sunny Stew Cork Head (Bis)hoo Kanhai Hall? Jos Buttler! Khan Vish Habibul Mann Sleep Maninder Fred, Younis Bonnor Hall? Jos Buttler! That Buttler wicket. The lead is 377. Hands thrown, edge found. \u201cThe type of shot you can play at England,\u201d says Athers, \u201cbut at the Wanderers the sort of shot that can get you in trouble.\u201d 48th over: England 160-6 (Root 28) And drinks are on the field. 47th over: England 157-5 (Root 27, Buttler 6) Jos is back on strike and tries to once again time a ball on the up through over. The problem was, it landed only a couple of metres in front of the catcher now positioned for that very shot. This is such a tough spot for Buttler to be in. Does he just go for it? But at what cost if it doesn\u2019t work out? Is he more effective in that mode anyway? Whatever it takes, I suppose. I reckon it\u2019s fair to conclude that he\u2019s just about batting for his Test career. \u201cMichael Carberry\u2019s being in that Ashes team (41st over) enabled Geoff Lemon, on OBO debut, to describe a drinks break with: \u2018Carbo hydrates\u2019,\u201d says Smylers. \u201cMaybe it was worth dropping him just to avoid any repeat offending?\u201d The old OBO format! And what a great memory you have. 46th over: England 156-5 (Root 26, Buttler 6) \u201cGame within a game here,\u201d says Nasser as Buttler takes guard. Indeed it is. Just as it was with Denly before tea. A big shout first ball! Nortje likes it for leg before; du Plessis fancies that he might have found an inside edge, taken by the captain on the deflection at second slip. The umpire keeps his finger down; a sigh of relief for the England \u2018keeper. The TV replay shows that it wasn\u2019t out on either front, comfortably going over the top. Right, he\u2019s off the mark with a couple to midwicket. One to come in the successful over and away it runs for four through cover! That\u2019s Buttler at his best, timing the socks off a delivery just short of a length, bisecting two fielders. Glorious! Eventful! That was nearly how Pope got himself into bother a couple of overs ago and this time it has brought his demise, cutting too close to his body and instead edging straight into the gloves of de Kock. That\u2019s his 200th dismissal in Test cricket. 45th over: England 146-4 (Root 26, Pope 7) Pretorius gives Root a couple to clip before landing the rest in a shoebox just on or outside the off-stump. But what du Plessis would give for Maharaj right now, I suspect. 44th over: England 144-4 (Root 24, Pope 7) They are asking KP on the to comment on Pope and sure enough, the No6 plays a magnificent on-drive for four. \u201cAn exhibition of playing that shot,\u201d he says. It\u2019s off Nortje too, the quickest of the bowlers, which seems to have suited him through the series. It\u2019s a long way away - and is far from the be all and end all - but it\u2019s easy to understand why England fans see this kid play and immediately think about how he\u2019s going to go in Australia two years from now. Now I\u2019ve written that, there was nothing more certain than him playing a rash shot, edging a late cut just short of du Plessis at second slip. 43rd over: England 138-4 (Root 23, Pope 2) A far more more chilled out environment now that Stokes has been and gone. Pope clips a single. He\u2019s clearly a smart young player so I don\u2019t expect anything rash from him. A red inker, perhaps. \u201cMy kid Ellis was born in 2017 on my birthday, 2nd February, and will forever be stealing my thunder. Next weekend is our 44th birthday!\u201d Nice one, Ben Roberts. If we\u2019re ten days early (whatever that means) we\u2019ll be joining you on that date. \u201cGood luck with Feb 12,\u201d adds Peter Salmon. \u201cThe birthday of my favourite ever cricketer, Gundappa Viswanath. Used to have great fun and boring parties interjecting with \u2018Did you know I once shared a taxi with Gundappa Viswanath?\u2019 It was a lie, but the party always went to a new and strange place, generally starting with the question \u2018Who is Gundappa Viswanath?\u2019 A tip for the listeners there.\u201d I hadn\u2019t thought of checking 12/2 (or 2/2) cricketers! I found a morbib 12/2/1920 birthdate in my travels but I should, as people always say on twitter, stick to sport. 42nd over: England 137-4 (Root 23, Pope 1) The new man is happy enough in defence until the final delivery, pulling Hendricks out to backward square to get off the mark and keep the strike to end the successful over. \u201cSibley might be mightily miffed but he now has a Test batting average of 40.22,\u201d notes Romeo. \u201cThis is an England opener we\u2019re talking about.\u201d Indeed. Good from Hendricks to stick to his plan outside the off-stump at Stokes, rewarded when the all-rounder tried to bully him through extra cover. With the outside edge found, RvdD claims a straightforward catch at slip. Fun cameo. 41st over: England 135-3 (Root 22, Stokes 28) Easy pickings for Root, given a full toss on his pads from Pretorius, putting it away without a bother. The all-rounder is back on the mark after that, finding the outside part of Root\u2019s bat, played with soft hands for one. It gives Stokes a chance and his innovation gets him four! Not from the blade but byes after leaping across his stumps to paddle but missing the ball - with de Kock up to the stumps, he had almost no chance of stopping it. Four more to finish, Stokes this time carving out past backward point and beating the sweeper. Find a telly, the big redhead is on one. 13 from the over; the lead is 352. \u201cAfter yesterday\u2019s \u2018what might have been\u2019 team talk, I was wondering if we could form a \u2018dropped into impossible England situations and then getting dropped as a result\u2019 team.\u201d I like this, Adam Simpson. \u201cGoing back to the 80s, I\u2019d pick Chris Cowdrey captaining an ostensibly new England \u2018team\u2019 against the Windies in 1988 after everyone had been dropped for being a bit crap. A latter days choice would be Michael Carberry for being just about the best player on that Ashes tour and being dumped as a result.\u201d Yes, Carberry is my nomination there. I still can\u2019t believe he was sacked. 40th over: England 122-3 (Root 17, Stokes 24) Is it too early for me to say... century in a session? Probably, but I\u2019ll look clever later on if it plays out that way. Sure enough, Stokes is on the attack against Hendricks again, driving him down the ground with tremendous class, to the long-on rope this time. Beautiful batting. He tries to hook to finish and there\u2019s a noise before the ball lands with de Kock but the umpire is unmoved. So is the technology when the TV take a second look at it. \u201cHello from Perth, Adam\u201d Hello to you, Laurence Davison.\u201d My wife\u2019s due date and eventual delivery fell a few days either side of 12/12/12. I love my son and everything but I still kind of think he should have made the effort to pop out a little earlier. Good luck!\u201d Thanks! Yes, I\u2019ve relayed this to the bump. Are they listening? And I wonder what they make of Mark Nicholas\u2019 soothing voice? 39th over: England 115-3 (Root 16, Stokes 18) Stokes is playing some immaculate strokes already. Just as he did in the previous Pretorious over, he\u2019s managed to whip him away from fifth stump through midwicket with complete control... what timing. \u201cNo many players in the world can play a shot like that,\u201d says Mikey Holding. Too right. Earlier, he took four more from a ball on leg stump. Party on. \u201cBest of luck with 02/02/20,\u201d writes Paul Callinan. \u201cI have nothing of interest to say about cricket, but can say that my two sons have pretty decent birthdates - 01/01/11 and 05/06/07.\u201d That\u2019s superb. Our due date is 12/2 so we also have 20/02/2020 in the frame. My sense is that with numbers like that, and a father like me, it is almost certain that they will grow to love the nerdier parts of Test cricket too. (Or not! That\u2019s fine too!) 38th over: England 107-3 (Root 16, Stokes 10) Oooh, Root\u2019s going hard too, nearly choping Hendricks on the delivery after he\u2019s beaten on the drive. With 33 overs left, they aren\u2019t trying to bash their way to a 420-ish (light it up) lead before declaring to get ten overs at the hosts tonight, are they? They 324 ahead now. 37th over: England 101-3 (Root 11, Stokes 9) Pretorius to Stokes and he plays a wonderful shot through midwicket to get the board ticking his way. That pitched about fifth stump - what brilliant, nimble wrists. Oh, and he goes again at the medium pacer, dancing down the track before checking a lofted drive over long-on for a once-bounce four. He swings again to finish (of course he does), an attempted slog sweep, but doesn\u2019t make contact. Fortunate not to lose his off stump but you wouldn\u2019t know it by the way he and Root are laughing between overs. \u201cI take your point about Buttler being caught in flagrante but recall that at the time I was surprised by how clearly (and selectively) stump mic was doing its job,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cMakes you wonder about other occasions where the broadcaster leaves the public volume down. As with the falling tree in the empty forest, is it only a demerit if the broadcaster chooses to let us hear it?\u201d In that case, I don\u2019t think there was much in it. Overall though, well, it\u2019s fairly obvious to me how this plays out and SuperSport are true masters of the craft. 36th over: England 93-3 (Root 11, Stokes 1) Credit to the South African bowlers who have collectively given up just 17 runs over the last ten overs, during a period of time when the visitors would have been planning to go at four or more an over. In other words, they\u2019ve earned that wicket. Will Stokes tee off? The lead is 309. Sibley is disgusted with himself; he\u2019s given catching practice to Malan at midwicket. Easy peasy for Hendricks, who gets himself into the book. 35th over: England 90-2 (Sibley 43, Root 10) My man Pretorius is back after his tidy spell before tea. He\u2019s full to Sibley, who trusts his swing to drive again on the up down the ground, cut off just inside the rope by Bavuma, three runs added. Mark Nicholas is discussing how high up they are in their commentary position and he\u2019s not wrong. I was calling the Jo\u2019burg Test two years ago between South Africa and Australia and it was the most difficult game I\u2019ve done on radio, like commentating a game from the top of the Great Southern Stand at the MCG. That\u2019s in contrast to Port Elizabeth, where you\u2019re sitting on the sightscreen. What a joyous ground that is at St George\u2019s Park. Can\u2019t wait to get back there next year. 34th over: England 87-2 (Sibley 40, Root 10) Sibley is on the move from the get-go, taking the single on offer behind square. In a sign of what I am sure is to come in this final session with England so far ahead, Root has a dash at a delivery well outside the off-stump, playing and missing by some way. With Hendricks angling in at him from around the wicket he has another pop to finish but picks out cover. The players are back on the field! Hendricks to Sibley. PLAY! \u201cHi Adam, hope all is well in your world.\u201d Thank you, Andy Wilson. To answer a couple of emails in one post: my partner is now officially full term. So, the waiting game has begun. Will we end up with a birth date of 02/02/2020? Time will tell. Said with all the self-awareness in the world... I think we\u2019re... ready? Yikes. \u201cRegarding the return of Jennings, may I share an illuminating tale from my own life?\u201d Please do. \u201cHaving split up with a fiancee because it wasn\u2019t working out, she asked to try again saying that it would all be different. Sadly even a spell in county cricket hadn\u2019t improved her technique and she was still giving her wicket away far too easily and even her brilliant fielding at Boot Hill could not compensate. So probably no.\u201d Indeed. But Jennings is a horse with a course, no? A few more emails before we return. \u201cI was really surprised to learn in the last match that the maximum runs in a Test over is still only 24,\u201d writes David Murray. \u201cI remember Kapil Dev hitting Eddie Hemmings for 4 successive sixes back in the 90s sometime I guess. Surely this record can\u2019t stand much longer given the way batsman play today and the huge inequalities in test sides? Any thoughts on when or who might break it?\u201d I reckon it\u2019s 28, the record off the bat held by George Bailey and Brian Lara now joined by Root (kinda) with those four leg byes in addition to 24 off the blade. Your broader point is spot on... it won\u2019t be long before we see six sixes in a Test. \u201cAfternoon, Adam.\u201d Hello, Brian Withington! \u201cTalking of the all-seeing SuperSport cameras (over 29), has the SA broadcaster got particular form in terms of highlighting \u2018high crimes and misdemeanours\u2019 by the away team? (For starters I\u2019m thinking Buttler/Stokes eavesdropping and, ahem, \u2018yellow tape\u2019-gate.) Shame they weren\u2019t operating in Ukraine and White House.\u201d They do have form but I don\u2019t think that excuses Buttler for his issue in Cape Town - that was on the live coverage. They did Stokes a beauty. By contrast, Philander\u2019s send-off to Buttler didn\u2019t get replayed. Make of that what you will. Yep, definitely Athers and Alec. Anyone since then before Sibley and Crawley? From Robin Hazlehurts. \u201cTo get a team with multiple wicket takers you need one where lots of batsmen bowl but the frontline bowlers don\u2019t just do it all themselves. I\u2019d hazard that an England team with Vaughan, Bell, KP, and Collingwood in it might do the job. And Cook. In fact I sort of remember an England team from that era in which everyone except the keeper had an international wicket, but I\u2019m not sure... And nor do I have the foggiest how to look it up.\u201d My problem, too! I have Statusguru and I have google. The 26th of January is a very contested national holiday in my native Australia. If you\u2019re interested in learning a bit about the progress made by Indigenous Australians in our game over the last few years, we had Dan Christian on The Final Word last week. Dan Norcross is my co-pilot while Geoff Lemon has a holiday. \u201cYou cut me off mid-sentence as I was composing a panegyric to England\u2019s 1989 Ashes bowling performance,\u201d writes Ian Forth. \u201cIt really is quite jaw-dropping. 19 bowlers used, 15 of them taking wickets, but only one (Foster) in double figures. No one averaged under 35, more than half of them averaged over 60, while Jarvis averaged 145 and Malcolm 166, with a strike rate of one wicket every 264 balls. No one took a 5 for and there was only one instance (Foster, again) of more than 5 wickets in the entire match. Only one bowler, the opening batsman Gooch, played in more than 3 matches. By the end, England were picking bowlers (Igglesden) that the captain hadn\u2019t seen bowl. By contrast, in 2005 England had 5 wicket takers for the entire series.\u201d Ahhh, the good old days! Yes, as soon as I typed my original request I had feeling 1989 (or other shocking tours) might skew it somewhat. What a time to be a kid. 33rd over: England 86-2 (Sibley 39, Root 10) That\u2019s kept real low, Malan nearly sneaking under Root\u2019s blade. The England captain shoots a smile at him, mindful surely of how that kind of volatility might help his bowlers at some stage tomorrow. He gets the chance to cut later in the over and doesn\u2019t miss out, playing late in classic Joe Root fashion, bisecting the gap behind point and adding a boundary. That\u2019s tea. England advanced their lead to 303 during the session. 32nd over: England 82-2 (Sibley 39, Root 6) Paterson finally concedes a run, Root pushing him out to cover. No concerns for the captain so far, gently playing himself in before tea. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see him go through the gears after the break. Nasser, who I really have so much admiration for, repeats a myth when talking about England\u2019s decision to bat again, saying that the VVS/Dravid Test of 2001 changed everything when it comes to the follow-on. In some ways, that\u2019s true. But not for Steve Waugh. Get this: he had the chance to enforce the follow on seven further times after Kolkata and he did so seven times for seven wins. 31st over: England 81-2 (Sibley 39, Root 5) Pieter Malan! Welcome to the attack for the first time in Test Cricket! We learn from the telly that his 115kph medium pacers were actually what he first got picked for as a South Africa rep during the Under 19 World Cup. And look, if you ignore the speed gun, this isn\u2019t bad at all. Sibley is right to leave the final delivery well alone, shaping nicely away from him. 30th over: England 80-2 (Sibley 39, Root 4) Ooiii! Paterson is so close to Sibley\u2019s outside edge, a ball that moves appreciably off the seam. He\u2019s doing a fine job of keeping England quiet, this his third maiden in a row since returning to the attack. Ten minutes remain until the tea interval is due. \u201cEngland in 1989 used 19 bowlers, of whom 15 took wickets,\u201d emails Ned Harrison. That was a 6 test series, though the 15 bowlers shared only 65 wickets between them (happy days). I think the most wicket takers in a 4 test series is 13 (West Indies v England 1929/30 and England v New Zealand in a 3 test series in 1937). England also had 12 wicket takers against New Zealand in 1949. 11 has been done several times, most recently by Australia in the West Indies in 2012.\u201d Ahh yes, the Windies in 2012 I remember well. Everyone was into it. Clarke picked up a bag of five at Dominica if memory serves me correctly (and it surely does). 29th over: England 80-2 (Sibley 39, Root 4) Another maiden, this time Pretorius to Root. He\u2019s maintaining a very disciplined fourth-stump line at the skipper. \u201cCan\u2019t believe it helps team morale to have the South African coaching and management team sitting together away from the team,\u201d observes David Brown. Maybe it\u2019s because the SuperSport cameras are panning to them every 30 seconds? That was certainly was the case yesterday. I guess that\u2019s what you get when recently-retired legends are running the national team: lots of interest. 28th over: England 80-2 (Sibley 39, Root 4) Another excellent over from Paterson, his second maiden on the trot to go with the wicket of Denly. \u201cI see England conceded just one extra in the SA innings,\u201d notes John Starbuck. \u201cThis looks like a considerable improvement on their usual performances and with all being pace bowlers, too. Is that a record of any kind?\u201d To the statisticians (or those with Andrew Samson\u2019s database): I\u2019m all ears. NOT OUT! The noise was trouser leg not inside edge. South Africa lose a review. IS SIBLEY CAUGHT BEHIND? We\u2019ll find out shortly, du Plessis has challenged a not out decision from the bowling off Paterson. 27th over: England 80-2 (Sibley 39, Root 4) Root off the mark, ticking a Pretorious delivery from leg stump down to the rope at fine leg. \u201cIn 1981,\u201d says Jon Akers, \u201cAlderman and Lillee took 81 of the 120 English wickets available.\u201d Yes, I expect there are many series where a few bowlers have dominated. But ever a time when more than ten have gotten into the book? With the caveat that I want this to be a series victory, not a massive loss where many players were used (e.g. 1989 Ashes) 26th over: England 75-2 (Sibley 38, Root 0) Paterson beats Root second up with a gorgeous away-swinger! He goes on to complete his wicket-maiden. Lovely work. Denly has done so much right on this tour, and indeed during the Ashes. I\u2019ve argued, and will continue to, that the volume of balls he has soaked up at crucial times has influenced this victory more than his average will ever show. In saying that, they\u2019ll probably drop him because that\u2019s how these things go. Sigh. He chops on! First ball of Paterson\u2019s new spell and it Denly pushes away from his body, the inside edge deflecting straight back onto his middle stump. Urgh. 25th over: England 75-1 (Sibley 38, Denly 8) Singles are exchanged into the covers off Pretorious but nothing else. The all-rounder locates Sibley\u2019s inside edge later in his over. In the absence of a spinner (and Philander), this is the dry spell he has to bowl, however futile it might appear right now in the match circumstances. 24th over: England 73-1 (Sibley 37, Denly 7) Another big over for England, nine from it, their lead now 290. Denly is off the mark with a compact clip, out to the rope from a misdirected Nortje full delivery. He adds three more when the big quick too wide later in the set, driving him past mid-off for three. Nice start. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of love for Zak,\u201d declares @VictorOpinions1 on the tweet. \u201cHe\u2019s doing all the right things, on and off the pitch and if he doesn\u2019t make it, a little part of me will die. Loved Goughie\u2019s story of how he gets a glass of water, and goes and sits in the bar with all the senior players, and just listens.\u201d I get the feeling we\u2019re going to get to know Sibley and Crawley very well over the next few years. But then again, I wouldn\u2019t be completely surprised if they bring Jennings in to do a job in Sri Lanka in March. Probably not, though. 23rd over: England 64-1 (Sibley 35, Denly 0) Another good shout from Pretorious, albeit with a delivery going down leg to Denly. I couldn\u2019t believe that it took du Plessis 65-odd overs to give his all-rounder a second spell in the first innings. He was outstanding with the older ball at Cape Town, his most recent outing. You can probably tell already that I am very big fan of his. He completes a maiden to Denly. \u201cI noticed that 10 England players have taken a wicket in this series (Wood, Woakes, Anderson, Broad, Stokes, Bess, Archer, Denly, Curran, Root),\u201d writes Paul McMillan. \u201cThat seems like a lot to me. Is this close to being a record or is it fairly normal?\u201d Ooooh, nice one. The opposite was true in the 2017-18 Ashes where only four Australian bowlers took wickets in their four-nil victory over England. But ten in four Tests, especially in a big win, feels like loads. Anyone want to work it out? 22nd over: England 64-1 (Sibley 35, Denly 0) Sibley is busy, having a gentle go at a full delivery from Nortje, the edge running away through about fourth slip for four. He\u2019s far more convincing later in the over, striking a glorious drive through cover point. It makes a lovely slow-mo replay: on the up with all the trimmings. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hello Adam Marshall in Somerset. \u201cSorry if this has been asked and much discussed, but wondering about when the last time we had two right handers opening the innings for England in tests? Between Cook, Strauss and Tresco, it must have been a fair few years, no? Keep up the good work.\u201d Cheers. I haven\u2019t got that to hand but I know it came up when I was on the BBC Cricket Social a couple of weeks back - my recollection is that Andy Zaltzman had to dig a long way back to find the previous pair. They\u2019re old school. I like it. 21st over: England 56-1 (Sibley 27, Denly 0) Crawley struck a delicious cover drive the ball before getting out, which might have informed why he used his blade to the wicket-taking delivery rather than getting it out of the way. Still, another steady start for England. Who saw that sentence coming a few weeks back? Denly\u2019s turn - a big afternoon for him. I don\u2019t believe it should be, but it is. Oh, I\u2019ve stitched Zak up magnificently there! Crawley won\u2019t be adding to his string of highest scores as he\u2019s edged a good\u2019un from Pretorious, through to the waiting gloves of de Kock. Very nice delivery from the all-rounder. 20th over: England 52-0 (Crawley 20, Sibley 27) Nortje returns for a second spell and, predicably, he\u2019s hitting the radar at 90mph right away. His reputation is growing by the innings. Likewise Crawley, who clips convincingly out behind square to get off strike. A bouncer follows at Sibley, which he gets underneath easily enough. I\u2019m sure Rob has already been all over this but I trust we\u2019re all on Crawley Watch for 67? If he gets there, he\u2019ll be the first player to have increased their highest score in each of their first six Test innings. Go you good thing. 19th over: England 51-0 (Crawley 19, Sibley 27) Sibley\u2019s inside edge was found by Hendricks in the previous over and Crawley\u2019s is here by Pretorious to start the new one. Good bowling. Sibley\u2019s turn and he brings up another 50 stand between this pair via a boundary down to third man, driven on the up behind point from the outside portion of the bat. It was in the air but there isn\u2019t a catcher there. 18th over: England 46-0 (Crawley 18, Sibley 23) Hendricks has started well, enticing Crawley into an uppish pull shot. Sibley gives the younger man the strike back and he plays a similar shot later in the over, landing about 15 metres in front of the man stationed at deep square leg. I suspect they\u2019ll be looking to score about four an over for the next two hours, so there will be some risks taken. Afternoon, all. When jumping on here to take over from Rob on the Sunday of the Cape Town Test, England were one-down in the series with half the squad in bed crook and Joe Root a couple of losses away from losing his job. Now, just a few weeks on, they are racking up third-innings declaraton runs ahead of an almost-certain victory, set to go home comprehensive three-one winners. That\u2019s drinks. Adam Collins will be with you for the rest of the day \u2013 you can email him on adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com, or tweet @collinsadam. Cheerio! 17th over: England 43-0 (Crawley 16, Sibley 22) Sibley gets away with a loose stroke, flashing Pretorius wide of gully at catchable height for four. \u201cI see you subscribe to the \u2018Vaughan was an excellent captain\u2019 view (over 9),\u201d says Andrew Cosgrove. \u201cI\u2019ve never been that convinced. It seems to me that he benefited from being able to put into place the plans derived by Duncan Fletcher, and also having arguably England\u2019s best ever pace quartet (there have been better individual bowlers but never four together in the same team). I mean, if you can say \u2018nothing much is happening now, I might as well bring on Simon Jones\u2019 things are mostly going to turn out pretty well. I had it in my head that Vaughan\u2019s captaincy looked weak after Fletcher stepped down as coach. Whenever I\u2019ve heard Virgil commentating he never strikes me as one of the sport\u2019s deeper thinkers.\u201d No time to reply, as I\u2019m about to do one, but there are a few thoughts in this old article. 16th over: England 38-0 (Crawley 15, Sibley 18) Hendricks has been warned for running on the pitch. He has a strangled LBW shout against Sibley, with the ball not coming back enough. England are 12 runs away from a third consecutive opening partnership of 50 or more. The last time that happened, I think, was when Vaughan and Trescothick made merry during the 2003-04 tour of Bangladesh. The last time England managed three century stands in a row was when Boycott and Edrich ground Australia down in 1970-71. 15th over: England 38-0 (Crawley 15, Sibley 18) Dwaine Pretorius replaces Dane Paterson, who bowled a good spell of 5.3-2-5-0. Still no official news on Vernon Philander\u2019s hamstring. 14th over: England 36-0 (Crawley 14, Sibley 17) \u201cI hope this is like 2004-05,\u201d says Andrew Gladwin, \u201cwhen England were too much for an SA side in transition, with AB de Villiers, Amla and Steyn at the start of their careers. By 2008, South Africa were good enough to win in England and Australia. But I fear we may be in terminal decline with the India/England/Australia ICC hegemony making it tough for our players to get sufficient financial reward from cricket (made worse by local administrative incompetence which hopefully will finish).\u201d Yes, if South Africa go the way of the West Indies, there isn\u2019t much left. The greed that is now commonplace in all sport is relentlessly dispiriting. Just piss off and ruin something else. That said, South Africa do at least have the spine of a good side \u2013 Markram, Elgar for a few years, de Kock, Rabada, Nortje. I know Markram has struggled since that magical series against Australia but I think he\u2019s too good to fade away. The middle order is the biggest concern. 13th over: England 35-0 (Crawley 13, Sibley 17) A thrilling short-arm pull from Crawley is brilliantly saved the sprawling substitute Keegan Petersen on the midwicket boundary, four runs thus becoming two. He gets four later in the over - well, the team do, as they were leg-byes - when Paterson strays on the pads. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cMy limited classical education (Latin O-level) sadly didn\u2019t extend to swear words (as mischievously encouraged by Davorder, over 64) but I rather liked this from the first blog I found on the subject: \u2018Te futueo et caballum tuum\u2019 translating as \u2018screw you and the horse you rode in on\u2019. Honourable mention to \u2018vescere bracis meis\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018eat my shorts\u2019, as Bartus Simpsonus might have put it.\u201d 12th over: England 28-0 (Crawley 10, Sibley 17) Hendricks cuts Crawley in half with an excellent nipbacker that bounces over the stumps. \u201cCan anyone please tell me what the numbers on the back of the players\u2019 shirts represent?\u201d asks Richard Davies. \u201cAlso, I once met Les Ames when he came to support a charity pub cricket match in West Malling, Kent, in the 1970s. Delightful chap. He confirmed he did put raw steak inside his gloves when he kept to Harold Larwood on the Bodyline tour.\u201d Those are squad numbers, which were introduced last year to help spectators identify players. I assume the players choose whatever one- or two-digit number they like, hence Root 66. 11th over: England 27-0 (Crawley 9, Sibley 17) England are 244 runs ahead. The pitch looks really flat, so I\u2019d imagine they\u2019ll be aiming to at least double that lead. This, from the PA wires, is very funny. Oh, men. Vernon Philander has been disciplined for an abusive send-off to Jos Buttler on day two of the fourth Test in Johannesburg. Buttler had launched a foul-mouthed outburst at Philander during the second Test in Cape Town and was on the receiving end of some predictable payback when he got out to the veteran seamer. Philander was fined 15% of his final match fee as a Test cricketer and handed a demerit point that will never be relevant given his forthcoming retirement. I wonder what he\u2019ll do with that demerit point. 10th over: England 26-0 (Crawley 8, Sibley 17) Beuran Hendricks replaces Nortje. His fourth ball is too wide to Sibley, who gets down on one knee to blast it to the cover boundary. There\u2019s so much to like about Crawley and Sibley, especially how well they know their games at such a young age. \u201cThe mention of Ivor Mendonca reminds me of his nephew, the great Clive Mendonca,\u201d says Robert Darby. \u201cI was at Wembley for his hattrick against Sunderland in the play-off final. He is a legend at both Charlton and Grimsby football clubs.\u201d When I first read that I thought it was a joke, like Roland Butcher and his brother Frank. Turns out it\u2019s true. Who knew? Robert did, clearly. 9th over: England 18-0 (Crawley 7, Sibley 10) The ball is out of shape, so there\u2019s a delay in play while it is changed. Crawley has a windy woof at the first delivery with the replacement ball. Careful now. \u201cThanks for the mention Rob,\u201d says William Ellen. \u201cRegarding QdK, a lot depends on the known unknowns. Whether he can increase his hunger for Test runs, whether he can get through those spells when the bowlers are on top and when conditions are adverse, and whether South Africa find a top five capable of setting up the innings the way the Aussies often did for Gilchrist. But the potential is there for legendary status. It will be interesting to see how he gets on as ODI captain. If it\u2019s as natural as a duck to water, then the no doubt looming Test vacancy might be the making of him. Kudos to Wood for that delivery though, to get that much zip off an old ball was mightily impressive.\u201d QdK doesn\u2019t strike me as a natural captain, but then nor did Michael Vaughan and it turned out he was a genius. But all this talk of known unknowns has put the wonderful Albert Barese in my head. (NB: Clip contains adult language, etc.) 8th over: England 18-0 (Crawley 7, Sibley 10) Sibley plays one of his favourite off-side shots, skimming a drive through backward point for four off Nortje. \u201cDo you know why sessions often finish after a wicket instead of the end of an over?\u201d says Harvey Mayne. \u201cThat seems to be an advantage for the batting team. I have never noticed it happening as often as I have in this series.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what the logic is; it\u2019s just always been that way. 7th over: England 13-0 (Crawley 6, Sibley 6) England are in no rush. They can bat in a bubble for the rest of the day - a fiasco notwithstanding - and start to think about a declaration overnight. South Africa are bowling well at the moment, Paterson in particular, but if they don\u2019t take early wickets they should get demoralised pretty quickly. There\u2019s a century out there for someone. \u201cI don\u2019t have the talent to add to some of the rather touching poetry offered by today\u2019s contributors,\u201d says Tom Parker. \u201cI would, however, like to share the earworm that\u2019s been plaguing me for a day and a half now, which is Ray Parker Jr\u2019s \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 replacing the title with the name \u2018Jos Buttler\u2019 in the chorus. I also have the man himself looking up from the crease and saying \u2018I ain\u2019t \u2018fraid of Ben Foakes.\u2019 Neither witty nor very original but I can\u2019t shake it from my head.\u201d Very kind of you to share. If there\u2019s one thing I love people sharing with me, it\u2019s an irritating earworm. It is quite amusing, though. I think. 6th over: England 13-0 (Crawley 6, Sibley 6) Apparently Philander did tweak his hamstring, so that could be a wrap for his Test career. If so, 224 wickets at 22.32 is quite a record \u201cVery glad to be able to keep up to date with the cricket in apocalyptic Wuhan,\u201d says Housie. \u201cGood performance so far from England.\u201d I don\u2019t know how to respond to that, except to say, well, be well, and thanks for getting in touch. I can\u2019t imagine how unnerving it must be. 5th over: England 12-0 (Crawley 6, Sibley 6) Sibley is beaten for pace by Paterson, with his bat coming down after the ball had zipped past him. It\u2019s been a fine start from Paterson, in fact, and later in the olver he straightens a beauty past Crawley\u2019s defensive push. \u201cLes Ames,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cStill, enough already.\u201d Oh yes, fair point. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s cheating, though, as keeper-batting was even tougher back then. Anyway, enough: Sangakkara\u2019s application for top-tier status is being considered by the committee. 4th over: England 11-0 (Crawley 6, Sibley 5) A short ball from Nortje is pulled brusquely for four by Crawley. He plays those cross-bat shots superbly. 3rd over: England 7-0 (Crawley 2, Sibley 5) Philander has tweaked something, possibly his hamstring, and leaves the field midway through the over to receive treatment. He looks uncomfortable rather than in agony, so he may be okay after a bit of manipulation. It would be a desperately sad way to finish his Test career. The same thing happened to the great Allan Donald on this ground in 2001-02. He was halfway through an over against Australia when he left the field in tears, knowing a torn hamstring meant his Test career was over. Paterson completes Philander\u2019s over and has an enquiry for LBW against Sibley turned down. Too high. 2nd over: England 6-0 (Crawley 1, Sibley 5) Anrich Nortje is given the new ball for the first time in his short Test career, a deserved promotion after his admirable performance throughout the series. Sibley, turned round by a good delivery, edges along the ground for four. \u201cWhy is it sensible to bat again now,\u201d asks Peter Hillmore, \u201cinstead of later if necessary?\u201d Two reasons, really. The first is to give the fast bowlers a rest, the second is because the pitch will deteriorate. And England only need a draw, so make that three. The chances of England losing are much greater if they enforce the follow-on. The previous Test was different because of the weather, the huge first-innings lead, the emphasis on spin bowling and the greater need to win the game. 1st over: England 0-0 (Crawley 0, Sibley 0) Vernon Philander, bowling in Test cricket for the last time, starts the innings with a maiden to Zak Crawley. \u201cYou make a very fair case for Sangakkara in the 2nd tier (A 2:1 rather than a 2:2 though?)\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cBut reference to all those pre-Gilchrist averages is plain cheating.\u201d Old Ivan Mendonca was a flippant inclusion, but the rest are post-Gilchrist. I think, I can\u2019t remember who else I mentioned. England will bat again, as expected. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cHaving a mid-morning scroll through the OBO, I noticed you had a slight brain fad and omitted Kumar Sangakkara from the top table of modern keeper/batsmen. Late night, was it? There\u2019s a possible case for Dhoni too but surely Sangakkara is nailed on.\u201d He averaged 40.48 in Tests as keeper, which is less than, among others, Les Ames, BJ Watling, Dinesh Chandimal, Quinton de Kock and even Ivan Mendonca. I suspect that average would have been higher had he stayed as a keeper throughout his career, but we\u2019ll never know, so I\u2019d keep him in the second tier. He\u2019s in the top tier of ODI keeper-batsmen though, probably with de Villiers, Buttler, de Kock, Gilchrist and of course Dhoni. Keeper-batsman department \u201cAlthough he gave up the gloves, surely Kumar Sangakkara tops the list of great wicketkeeper-batsmen?\u201d says Darryl Account. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget Denis Lindsay and his demolition of the 1966/7 Australian attack in South Africa.\u201d Ah, I was only talking about a post-Gilchrist world, which is why I omitted Lindsay. And rightly or wrongly, I think of Sangakkara as a great batsman rather than a great keeper-batsman. I was tempted to include Matt Prior, who was brilliant from around 2009-13. Gentle Sunday statgasm Wood is averaging 77 with the bat and 13.62 with the ball in this series. That\u2019s lunch. England lead by 217 runs and will surely bat again. Wood ended with figures of 14.3-2-46-5. He was too fast, too straight, too much for South Africa. After all those injuries, all those years of misery, it\u2019s thoroughly heartwarming stuff. You beauty! Mark Wood gets his second five-for in three Tests. Paterson had a desperate hack and was caught behind by Buttler to end the innings. Wood led England off, waving the ball and sporting a huge smile. The England balcony were all on their feet, with Paul Collingwood coming down from the balcony to greet Wood with a big Durham hug. I doubt there is a more popular cricketer in England. 68th over: South Africa 179-9 (Hendricks 5, Paterson 0) Hendricks, trying to flick Stokes to leg, gets a thick leading edge for four. That should be lunch, but play will continue because South Africa are nine down. 67th over: South Africa 175-9 (Hendricks 1, Paterson 0) Mark Wood has four for 42. In other news, and on the subject of Peter Cook, Romeo has found this gem. With the tail exposed, Mark Wood returns to the attack. But it\u2019s de Kock he cleans up with a fantastic delivery! It roared back through the gate to trim the bails - and break one of them, in fact. That was a beautiful bit of bowling to end a charming innings from de Kock. Wood needs one more for his second five-for in three Tests. 66th over: South Africa 172-8 (de Kock 75, Hendricks 0) \u201cI haven\u2019t got Kim Thonger\u2019s class or erudition,\u201d boasts Matt Dony, \u201cso I went with a limerick\u2026 There was a young bowler named Wood; And when he was fit, he was good! If he makes it down under, Splitting batsmen asunder, Then he\u2019ll surely deserve a knighthood. Ben Stokes is so damn hot right now. He has been the most threatening bowler by a mile this morning, and now he has dismissed Pretorius to break an irksome eighth-wicket partnership. It was an excellent delivery, which lifted and straightened from just back of a length to take the edge, and Crawley took a brilliant low catch in the gully. 65th over: South Africa 163-7 (de Kock 66, Pretorius 37) The early signs are that the replacement ball is as laconic as the original, so I suspect Joe Root will bring himself on soon. The partnership is now 70 runs in 22 overs. \u201cThe traditional Mark Wood haiku demands a turning point and a season word,\u201d says Simon Coppock. \u201cPerhaps this: Like the horse chestnut As winter turns to the spring Wood has the conker 64th over: South Africa 162-7 (de Kock 65, Pretorius 37) England have finally persuaded the umpires to replace the knackered old ball with a slightly less knackered old ball. Stokes appeals on his own for caught behind when Pretorius pushes down the wrong line at an excellent delivery. England frittered away a review a few overs ago so they can\u2019t risk their last one on that. Pretorius responds impressively to the play-and-miss, timing a sweet boundary down the ground later in the over. He really is overqualified for a No9 batsman. \u201cHearing Vaughan\u2019s nickname was Virgil has given me an idea,\u201d says Davorder. \u201cAfter the trouble England players have gotten into on this tour with expletives, they could do worse than use the lines of the Roman poet Virgil to castigate their foes both on the field of play and off it. For example: \u2018Una salus victus nullam sperare salutem.\u2019 (The only hope for the doomed is no hope at all). Incidentally, I believe this sentiment was lifted by John Cleese in the film Clockwise. Benefits of a classical education, as Hans Gruber would say; and I\u2019m confident that England players can say these lines without losing their match fees.\u201d Frank Tyson would certainly approve. I wish somebody, ideally Duncan Hamilton, would write a biography of Tyson. I\u2019m not sure England have ever produced a more interesting cricketer. 63rd over: South Africa 158-7 (de Kock 65, Pretorius 33) de Kock drives Woakes for four more, a beautifully placed shot that fizzes between extra cover and mid off. England haven\u2019t bowled badly this morning, they\u2019ve just come up against the old overseas formula. Flat pitch + old ball + good batting = hard yakka. 62nd over: South Africa 153-7 (de Kock 61, Pretorius 32) Ben Stokes comes in an attempt to make something happen. And he does, angling consecutive deliveries past de Kock\u2019s outside edge. The second in particular was a beauty that lifted sharply off a length. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says William Ellen. \u201cAt the age of, off the top of my head, 27 years and 40 days, Quinton de Kock is probably halfway through his Test career. Where do you think he\u2019s currently at in the wicketkeeper-batsman\u2019s pantheon? He\u2019s clearly staggeringly talented, with a Gilchrist-like ability to slice an attack to death a la the Game of Thrones character Sword of the Morning. But he also has an uncanny ability to get himself out. For example the first innings of the last Test, at the start of the day having just seen Philander get castled playing a loose drive in the previous over, he played exactly the same shot to his third ball of the day.\u201d He reminds me a bit of Stokes the batsman: he will always play matchwinning innings because of his talent, but lacks the concentration and ruthlessness of the remorselessly consistent. I suppose if anyone can instil those in him, it\u2019ll be Jacques Kallis. At this stage I\u2019d put him among the second tier of modern keeper-batters in Test cricket, with Gilchrist, Andy Flower and maybe AB de Villiers (I can\u2019t remember, did he play enough games as keeper?) at the top table. But he has the ability to finish with a career average in the high 40s. How about you? 61st over: South Africa 151-7 (de Kock 60, Pretorius 31) \u201cI almost feel guilty for even mentioning the Peter Cook tour de force,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cAlmost. It\u2019s possibly the most perfect Establishment parody alongside his treatment of Premier Harold Macmillan - would love to have seen him tackle our current PM \u2018of the people\u2019.\u201d Oh my, how good would that be. At least we\u2019ll always have Ben Swain. 60th over: South Africa 151-7 (de Kock 60, Pretorius 31) A wide outswinger from Curran is belted for four by de Kock. He is playing with immaculate judgement as well as his usual flair, and it\u2019s a pleasure to watch. England, who are getting frustrated, plead unsuccessfully for a change of ball. They\u2019ll have to wait another 20 overs for a new one. \u201cOn the pink oboe,\u201d begins Peter Wood. \u201cIt was in fact Billy Connolly who passed on this line to Peter Cook before the performance and Cook promptly inserted it (oo-er) into his brilliant near improvisatory monologue. Cook\u2019s touch of genius was to add the words, \u2018a confirmed\u2019 (player of the pink oboe.) While we\u2019re on the subject of Cook\u2019s genius, who could forget his brilliant one-liner in Beyond the Fringe as he sits reading a newspaper, \u2018ullo, ullo, I see the Titanic\u2019s sunk again.\u2019\u201d 59th over: South Africa 146-7 (de Kock 56, Pretorius 30) de Kock survives a biggish LBW appeal after offering no stroke to a nipbacker from Woakes. It was too high. Joe Root decides to review, which I suspect is a desperate decision. We\u2019ll soon find out. Yes, replays show it was bouncing over the stumps, so England lose a review. I know this sounds a bit snide, but Eoin Morgan wouldn\u2019t have reviewed that. Root has never been great with DRS, as captain or batsman. Later in the over de Kock drags Woakes for two to bring up a largely serene fifty partnership with Pretorius. They\u2019ve both played really well. 58th over: South Africa 142-7 (de Kock 53, Pretorius 29) Byootiful stroke from Pretorius, who laces Curran through the covers for four more. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Ian Forth. \u201cWasn\u2019t 2003 also the year Martin Bicknell earned the nickname \u2018Odysseus\u2019 after wandering around in county cricket for ten years.\u201d Very good. To my great disappointment, the Jacques Rudolph set-up doesn\u2019t appear to be on YouTube. I did find the OBO, though. 57th over: South Africa 138-7 (de Kock 53, Pretorius 25) Woakes returns after the drinks break. The ball hasn\u2019t really moved this morning, in the air or off the pitch, and batting continues to look very comfortable for de Kock in particular. If he concentrates he should make a hundred. 56th over: South Africa 138-7 (de Kock 53, Pretorius 25) \u201cSome excellent sourdough toast this morning has moved me to compose a dodgy haiku for Mark Wood,\u201d says Kim Thonger. Mark Wood is famed for horseplay, but now also for deeds of derring-do *slinks off to field at deep fine leg* 55th over: South Africa 137-7 (de Kock 52, Pretorius 25) England don\u2019t look like taking a wicket. Yesterday they beat the bat in almost every over, but this morning there have been few false strokes. The moment I type that, Pretorius plays a couple of windy cross-bat shots at Broad and is beaten. 54th over: South Africa 136-7 (de Kock 51, Pretorius 25) Pretorius steers Curran short of and then through the slips for four. With the match and series apparently a formality, it\u2019s easy to forget the individual context. Pretorius is trying to forge a Test career, and a big score here should secure a place in the squad for the tour of the Caribbean later in the year. 53rd over: South Africa 132-7 (de Kock 51, Pretorius 21) de Kock drives Broad for a couple to reach another stylish fifty, his 21st in Tests. In a struggling team, he\u2019s a rare source of pride. He\u2019s the most beautiful player to watch. \u201cI can\u2019t think of the last player that made me feel as genuinely chuffed they were in the team as Mark Wood does (probably Tuffers),\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cHe seems such an utter anachronism compared to the modern, skillsets and areas players, and so he\u2019s by definition the most refreshing and interesting to see. Of course he\u2019s serious about the game, but it all comes with such joie de vivre that it\u2019s life-affirming to see him fit and playing well. As you say, he\u2019ll never play all the games, but this last two Tests have shown how dangerous he is. You really could see him causing real bother in Australia. Just how can we keep him fit?\u201d We can\u2019t, so \u2013 clich\u00e9 alert \u2013 we really should enjoy every Test as if it\u2019s his last. But it\u2019s hard not to do a little jig around the office at the thought of him and Archer bowling together at the Gabba in November 2021. 52nd over: South Africa 130-7 (de Kock 49, Pretorius 21) Sam Curran replaces Wood, who wasn\u2019t at his sharpest this morning. That\u2019s a decent move, not least because Curran dismissed de Kock in the first innings of the first three Tests. He starts with a maiden to Pretorius, who survives an optimistic LBW appeal. Too high. \u201cRemember, too, that Rob Key\u2019s England nickname during that halcyon year of 2003 was Ovid, because he used to follow Virgil in the batting order and had a sybaritic lifestyle before his exile (back to county cricket),\u201d says James Debens. \u201cSorry, I meant his England nickname was Ovoid.\u201d 51st over: South Africa 130-7 (de Kock 49, Pretorius 21) It\u2019s been a comfortable start for South Africa, that soft wicket of Philander aside. With few demons in the pitch and the second new ball not available for another 29 overs, this is a chance for de Kock and Pretorious to cash in. \u201cIs it cynical to suggest that Root is secretly hoping that SA add a few this morning, to make his inevitable decision not to enforce the follow-on look less absurd?\u201d asks Robert Ellson. Absurd? That\u2019s a bit harsh. I reckon 98 per cent of Test captains past and present would bat again in this situation. (When I say \u2018past\u2019, I mean if they were watching the game in 2020, rather than making the decision in their day.) 50th over: South Africa 128-7 (de Kock 48, Pretorius 20) A short ball from Wood follows de Kock, who bends his back and guides it over first slip for four. He\u2019s a wonderfully skilful batsman. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cI think James Debens might have been slyly referencing Peter Cook\u2019s immortal take on the judge summing up for the jury in the Jeremy Thorpe trial. I seem to recall that the obo(e) in question was pink.\u201d A-ha. Outed as a philistine, again. 49th over: South Africa 123-7 (de Kock 43, Pretorius 20) Pretorius softens his hands to guide Broad to the third man boundary. South Africa need 201 to avoid the follow on, though I\u2019m almost certain England won\u2019t enforce it anyway. \u201cGood morning Rob,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cI noticed numerous quotes yesterday, mostly in Latin, attributed to Virgil. This reminded me that Michael Vaughan was apparently nicknamed \u2018Virgil\u2019 for his likeness to the Thunderbirds character, whose specialist expertise of course included demolition, heavy lifting and logistics, but not, to my knowledge, Latin.\u201d Ha. That\u2019s one for the Forgotten Nicknames XI. Since reading your email I\u2019ve experienced a Proustian rush of memories from 2003 \u2013 mainly of my old Channel 4 editor, Duncan Steer, referring to Virgil Vaughan. I\u2019m right there, right now, in a proto-hipster office in Camden with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs\u2019 debut album playing in the background. And my hair is to die for. All that from a nickname. 48th over: South Africa 119-7 (de Kock 43, Pretorius 16) A short blast of hot hot heat from Wood. An excellent short ball to de Kock takes a leading edge and lands safely in front of Wood. He follows that with a full-length ball that finds the edge and flies through the vacant third slip area for four. \u201cSuch is Mark Wood\u2019s charisma that I give an extra two pounds to the Big Issue seller who bears an extremely striking resemblance to him,\u201d says James Debens. \u201cYou know, the one with the immaculate dentistry who stands outside Co-op and has an iPhone XR that he checks on the sly (a self-confessed player of the OBO perhaps)?\u201d Player? 47th over: South Africa 113-7 (de Kock 37, Pretorius 16) Broad replaces Woakes and almost strikes with his first ball, which de Kock edges a fraction short of first slip. Then Pretorius, who has started imperiously, drives Broad to the cover boundary with a flourish. He has 16 from 11 balls. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cJolly good morning to you. I\u2019m christening a new tea pot - with pictures of cows on the side. That is a lovely interview between Ward, Wood and Broad. (Lovely name for a legal practice, too.) It might be naive of me, but I think I enjoy watching a victory if I think the chaps have conducted themselves decently, although I\u2019m totally against judgement (part of my profession), if that isn\u2019t an oxymoron. I think that all possible misdemeanours should be judged against: 1) was it premeditated 2) was it done to attempt to gain competitive advantage. Any issue not gaining both strikes should be struck off, especially when the chap apologises as nicely as Ben Stokes did.\u201d 46th over: South Africa 108-7 (de Kock 36, Pretorius 12) I don\u2019t know about you, but I assumed Mark Wood\u2019s Test career was over, so this is such an uplifting development. He\u2019s getting on a wee bit - he turned 30 earlier in the month - but he\u2019s now a serious option for the tours of India and Australia next year. If he can play three of the five Tests in each of those series, England will be very happy. They might even win a game! Back in the year 2020, de Kock drives Wood confidently for three. Pretorius sees that stroke and raises it with a lovely drive for four. With a first-class average of 37.50, he\u2019s a bit overqualified to beat at No9. 45th over: South Africa 100-7 (de Kock 33, Pretorius 7) Pretorius thumps Woakes through mid-off for four. And why not? 44th over: South Africa 95-7 (de Kock 33, Pretorius 2) Wood bowls a maiden to de Kock. Decent pace, mainly in the high 80s. He\u2019ll be desperate for another five-for this morning. \u201c\u2018Internally I was buzzing but externally you\u2019ve got to act cool, tap the pitch and stuff like that,\u2019\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma, quoting Mark Wood\u2019s interview before play. \u201cThis reminds me of the time my club sent me out as a 10-year-old pinch-hitting opener. I was the youngest guy in the side and their regular No11. So when almost an hour later I was the last to be dismissed after making a stoic 20-something while all the adolescents collapsed at the other end, I received a thousand unlikely pats on my back for my batting. The opposition collapsed too, but eventually won with only a wicket to spare. It was terrible cricket, yet it was wonderful.\u201d 43rd over: South Africa 95-7 (de Kock 33, Pretorius 2) South Africa are a mess. It\u2019s sad to see, and also a little bewildering given how well they played in the first two Tests. Chris Woakes will open the bowling, a nice reward for a high-class performance yesterday. And he needs only three balls to take the first wicket of the day! It was a poor delivery in truth, well outside leg stump, but Woakes won\u2019t care. Philander tried to help it on its way, was through the shot too early and got a leading edge to mid-off. 42nd over: South Africa 88-6 (de Kock 32, Philander 0) Wood has one delivery remaining of his ninth over, having dismissed Nortje with the last ball of yesterday\u2019s play. He bowls it to the new batsman Vernon Philander, who defends solidly. Mark Wood makes the world a better place department There\u2019s a lovely interview with Wood and Stuart Broad on Sky right now. Ian Ward Gentlemen, good morning. Mark Wood, genuine allrounder? Mark Wood Ah, it\u2019s nice to get a few. I\u2019ll take it. \u2018Genuine allrounder\u2019 - I\u2019ll take it. Ian Ward Now, did you allow your wife to speak you last night or were you too busy watching yourself on the highlights? Mark Wood I got the highlights in, don\u2019t worry about that! Ah it was good, I actually gave Sarah a mention in the press conference. They said, \u2018You\u2019ve done a bit of work on your batting\u2019 and I said, \u2018Ah my wife fed us on the bowling machine a few times\u2019, so I think we\u2019re even. Ian Ward (pointing at Broad) You were on time for this interview, he wasn\u2019t. Why? Broad I mean, to quote Mark Wood in the changing-room: \u2018When I\u2019m playing this well, the press can wait for me!\u2019 Wood You two have set me up an absolute treat here! Wow. Broad He is playing well though. Ward What was your favourite shot? Wood Ah, the six over cover! Internally I was buzzing but externally you\u2019ve got to act cool, tap the pitch and stuff like that. Some pre-match reading Morning. Even the pessimists think this is a done deal. England were so dominant yesterday that it\u2019s hard to see anything other than a third consecutive victory. If that happens, it will be the first time since the 1954-55 Ashes that England have come from behind to win an overseas series 3-1. Then, as now, one of the stars was an injury-prone fast bowler. Mark Wood doesn\u2019t sledge people by quoting Wordsworth, as Frank Tyson did, but they do have the same appetite for destruction and ability to bowl in excess of 95mph. And although his record is nowhere near as good - Tyson averaged 18.56 from his 17 Tests - Wood\u2019s performances since his recall in St Lucia last year have evoked the mythical devastation of Tyson in that Ashes series. It\u2019s a small sample size, for sure, but 12 wickets at 14.75 is eyecatching stuff. He was far too hot for South Africa yesterday, taking three of the six wickets that fell in the evening session, and he\u2019ll be eyeing another five-for this morning. South Africa will resume on 88 for six, still 312 runs behind in a match they need to win. It\u2019s a long way back from here.",

The most severe \u201cgrade three\u201d strain is where the fibre has completely torn. You would normally feel a pop in that situation \u2013 it might even be audible. Though it may not be as painful as a moderate strain, you would know that it was serious because you would lose some ability to use that muscle, and might need to undergo surgery \u2013 but grade three strains are really rare. If it is moderate or severe, it is worth getting a diagnosis from a physio so that they can set you on the path to rehab. The key thing is to understand what you have done in the first place \u2013 if you self-diagnose and then go to the internet, you could make it worse for yourself.

      "body": "<p>Last week, to a soundtrack of Michael Jackson\u2019s Heal The World, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 walked on to a stage in a Paris hotel to unveil his new charity called Inspired by KM. Cheesy? If you insist, but even the most cynical onlooker would have found it hard to scoff at most of what followed. Mbapp\u00e9, at the age of 21, is the football superstar the world needs right now.</p> <p>On the pitch he showcases a rare amalgam of qualities: extraordinary speed, extreme technical prowess and preternatural awareness. Off the pitch he stands out for his simple decency despite the razzmatazz that could consume him. His father, Wilfrid, has a nice line about him. \u201cOf course he\u2019s normal; most people are.\u201d</p> <p>That gets to the heart of it: as a footballer Mbapp\u00e9 knows he is better than nearly everybody else; as a person he does not consider himself to be more special than anyone. He has exceptional wealth \u2013 with an annual income estimated at around \u00a320m \u2013 but he does not keep it all for himself.</p> <p>In football terms, the moment Mbapp\u00e9 made the jump from thrilling talent to bona fide great can be pinpointed to France\u2019s second\u2011round victory over Argentina at the 2018 World Cup, when he blasted through Lionel Messi &amp; co <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/30/france-argentina-world-cup-last-16-match-report\" title=\"\">to drive France to a 4-3 win</a>. <em>Les Bleus</em> went on to win the tournament and then Mbapp\u00e9 did something else remarkable, donating all his match fees and bonuses \u2013 around \u00a3275,000 \u2013 to charity. Before the tournament England\u2019s players took the collective decision to do the same; Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s was a solo initiative.</p> <p>So there was nothing surprising about Mbapp\u00e9 launching his own charity. And yet, it was still amazing to see how natural he made it all seem and how darn likeable this young man who has it all is. Inspired by KM \u2013 or, to be precise, by his mother, Fayza Lamari, who came up with the idea \u2013 has committed to helping 98 children from Paris to fulfil their dreams. What does that mean? Whatever they want it to mean, as Mbapp\u00e9 says he will help the children, now aged between nine and 14, to pursue whatever path they choose. \u201cWe will support them until their working lives begin,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The kids and their parents attended the presentation. \u201cI would like to go into medicine,\u201d says one boy. \u201cA career in singing would be amazing,\u201d ventures the girl beside him. \u201cI would like to become the Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 of maths,\u201d says a boy of about 10. Many others say they did not yet know what they would like to do when they grow up. Which is fine, because over the next few years the charity will expose them to all kinds of activities, from language lessons and art and craft classes to sports events and foreign trips.</p> <p>Mbapp\u00e9 explains he made a point of picking kids from a variety of social, ethnic and economic backgrounds. \u201cIt is important for everyone to mingle with people they might not otherwise meet,\u201d he says. Before being accepted on the programme the children must sign a charter pledging, among other things, \u201cto stay humble ... to take responsibility for my actions \u2026 to take the time to listen to others \u2026 to manage my emotions, problems and conflicts with dialogue and without resorting to violence.\u201d</p> <p>In front of an audience of about 300 people, Mbapp\u00e9 introduces the people who will help him run the charity, including his parents, two aunts and the headmaster of the school he went to. He stresses that he will be very much involved. \u201cI didn\u2019t set this up to delegate, I am going to invest myself in this to the maximum,\u201d he says. He seems surprised when someone asks him why he feels a need to give back to society. \u201cBecause society has given to me,\u201d he says, as if the answer is perfectly obvious.</p> <p>Is he trying to improve the image of footballers? \u201cMaybe we can change people\u2019s preconceptions but we can\u2019t control what people think,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to give a hand to children and make them smile.\u201d</p> <p>Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s lawyer, Delphine Verheyden, helps to arrange all his commercial and philanthropic activities. She has said the player has received several sponsorship offers every day since the 2018 World Cup win. Mbapp\u00e9 says he does not go for the most lucrative. \u201cOf course it\u2019s about business but it also has to be about people,\u201d he says. \u201cValues are important.\u201d</p> <p>That attitude makes him even more attractive to corporations. In addition to paying him well for his endorsements, several of them are contributing financially to his charity and sent representatives to speak at the presentation. The woman from Good Go\u00fbt, who will provide healthy cooking lessons to the 98 kids, spoke well and when she reeled off some grim facts \u2013 \u201cin France today, eight\u2011year-old children have, on average, already eaten as much sugar as their grandparents did in their entire lives\u201d, Mbapp\u00e9 looks dismayed, genuinely.</p> <p>Then the man from Hublot said his company was delighted to back the project, adding something about Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s combination of technical mastery and good conscience making him just the chap to promote quality timepieces. And the male cosmetics company executive who flew in from Japan suggested that getting men to look after their skin is an important step towards getting them to take care of the planet. Yes, the lads in suits were really stretching themselves.</p> <p>Mbapp\u00e9, meanwhile, came across as a natural. Maybe he is a world\u2011class actor as well as a world\u2011class footballer. But it is nice to believe that the player who could dominate football for the next decade really is just a good guy. Pity he plays for Paris Saint-Germain.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last week, to a soundtrack of Michael Jackson\u2019s Heal The World, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 walked on to a stage in a Paris hotel to unveil his new charity called Inspired by KM. Cheesy? If you insist, but even the most cynical onlooker would have found it hard to scoff at most of what followed. Mbapp\u00e9, at the age of 21, is the football superstar the world needs right now. On the pitch he showcases a rare amalgam of qualities: extraordinary speed, extreme technical prowess and preternatural awareness. Off the pitch he stands out for his simple decency despite the razzmatazz that could consume him. His father, Wilfrid, has a nice line about him. \u201cOf course he\u2019s normal; most people are.\u201d That gets to the heart of it: as a footballer Mbapp\u00e9 knows he is better than nearly everybody else; as a person he does not consider himself to be more special than anyone. He has exceptional wealth \u2013 with an annual income estimated at around \u00a320m \u2013 but he does not keep it all for himself. In football terms, the moment Mbapp\u00e9 made the jump from thrilling talent to bona fide great can be pinpointed to France\u2019s second\u2011round victory over Argentina at the 2018 World Cup, when he blasted through Lionel Messi &amp; co to drive France to a 4-3 win. Les Bleus went on to win the tournament and then Mbapp\u00e9 did something else remarkable, donating all his match fees and bonuses \u2013 around \u00a3275,000 \u2013 to charity. Before the tournament England\u2019s players took the collective decision to do the same; Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s was a solo initiative. So there was nothing surprising about Mbapp\u00e9 launching his own charity. And yet, it was still amazing to see how natural he made it all seem and how darn likeable this young man who has it all is. Inspired by KM \u2013 or, to be precise, by his mother, Fayza Lamari, who came up with the idea \u2013 has committed to helping 98 children from Paris to fulfil their dreams. What does that mean? Whatever they want it to mean, as Mbapp\u00e9 says he will help the children, now aged between nine and 14, to pursue whatever path they choose. \u201cWe will support them until their working lives begin,\u201d he says. The kids and their parents attended the presentation. \u201cI would like to go into medicine,\u201d says one boy. \u201cA career in singing would be amazing,\u201d ventures the girl beside him. \u201cI would like to become the Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 of maths,\u201d says a boy of about 10. Many others say they did not yet know what they would like to do when they grow up. Which is fine, because over the next few years the charity will expose them to all kinds of activities, from language lessons and art and craft classes to sports events and foreign trips. Mbapp\u00e9 explains he made a point of picking kids from a variety of social, ethnic and economic backgrounds. \u201cIt is important for everyone to mingle with people they might not otherwise meet,\u201d he says. Before being accepted on the programme the children must sign a charter pledging, among other things, \u201cto stay humble ... to take responsibility for my actions \u2026 to take the time to listen to others \u2026 to manage my emotions, problems and conflicts with dialogue and without resorting to violence.\u201d In front of an audience of about 300 people, Mbapp\u00e9 introduces the people who will help him run the charity, including his parents, two aunts and the headmaster of the school he went to. He stresses that he will be very much involved. \u201cI didn\u2019t set this up to delegate, I am going to invest myself in this to the maximum,\u201d he says. He seems surprised when someone asks him why he feels a need to give back to society. \u201cBecause society has given to me,\u201d he says, as if the answer is perfectly obvious. Is he trying to improve the image of footballers? \u201cMaybe we can change people\u2019s preconceptions but we can\u2019t control what people think,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to give a hand to children and make them smile.\u201d Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s lawyer, Delphine Verheyden, helps to arrange all his commercial and philanthropic activities. She has said the player has received several sponsorship offers every day since the 2018 World Cup win. Mbapp\u00e9 says he does not go for the most lucrative. \u201cOf course it\u2019s about business but it also has to be about people,\u201d he says. \u201cValues are important.\u201d That attitude makes him even more attractive to corporations. In addition to paying him well for his endorsements, several of them are contributing financially to his charity and sent representatives to speak at the presentation. The woman from Good Go\u00fbt, who will provide healthy cooking lessons to the 98 kids, spoke well and when she reeled off some grim facts \u2013 \u201cin France today, eight\u2011year-old children have, on average, already eaten as much sugar as their grandparents did in their entire lives\u201d, Mbapp\u00e9 looks dismayed, genuinely. Then the man from Hublot said his company was delighted to back the project, adding something about Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s combination of technical mastery and good conscience making him just the chap to promote quality timepieces. And the male cosmetics company executive who flew in from Japan suggested that getting men to look after their skin is an important step towards getting them to take care of the planet. Yes, the lads in suits were really stretching themselves. Mbapp\u00e9, meanwhile, came across as a natural. Maybe he is a world\u2011class actor as well as a world\u2011class footballer. But it is nice to believe that the player who could dominate football for the next decade really is just a good guy. Pity he plays for Paris Saint-Germain.",

Charities, churches and care homes are among the organisations paying far more than they should for their energy after falling prey to the unregulated brokers, the documents say. Some individual firms are seeking payouts of up to \u00a31m, according to one claims management firm that is seeking legal settlements for small businesses against their brokers. Ofgem plans to launch a call for evidence in the next few months to determine the extent of the mis-selling problem in the energy market. The report, seen by the Guardian, says many energy market brokers promise the best energy deal for small businesses at no charge to their client but go on to offer poor-value deals picked exclusively from suppliers that offer the most lucrative terms for the brokers. A growing number of brokers can claim billions of pounds in commissions that are hidden in the inflated supply deals, many of which stretch over three to five years, according to the report. Callum Thompson, the founder of Business Energy Claims (BEC) and a former energy broker, said 90% of micro-businesses using an energy broker may have fallen prey to mis-selling \u201cin at least some form\u201d because there is no official regulation in place to protect them. He said energy suppliers were \u201ccompletely complicit\u201d because they help to hide the broker commission in their energy bills. Thompson said it was not unusual for small business owners to be caught out by oral agreements which are binding under current regulations. The number of energy brokers in the UK has ballooned to around 3,000, in part because the outfits are cheap to set up and face virtually no regulation despite the large sums of money at stake. The regulator estimates that businesses, charities and public bodies spend about \u00a325bn to cover their energy bills every year, of which about half is bought through energy brokers.

Bryan was lucky not to be booked and when Friend blew for the break Fulham could be heartened by having not conceded again. A measure of the one-way traffic, though, was found in them having had three touches in City\u2019s area. The tally for Guardiola\u2019s men had been near-countless.</p> <p>They began the second half with another spurned chance. Angeli\u00f1o traded passes with Phil Foden, then found David Silva inside the area. The captain relayed the ball to Mahrez yet from an inviting angle he blasted high.</p> <p>It had Guardiola grimacing and Mahrez was replaced early in the half \u2013 by Raheem Sterling \u2013 because of a \u201ckick\u201d on the Algerian, the manager explained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Against a backdrop more akin to a summer warm-up game, Fulham\u2019s brightest moment arrived via a free-kick in an advanced position. Stefan Johansen floated the ball in but Cavaleiro bumped into Bernardo Silva and though Parker protested Friend adjudged no foul play.</p> <p>City continued to probe. Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi rolled the ball to Foden, it went to G\u00fcndogan, David Silva and, once more, they could not capitalise.</p> <p>Then, at last, they did. This was simple and derived from Fulham again trying to play out from the back. Bobby Decordova-Reid was caught out close to goal, the ball went to Jo\u00e3o Cancelo and Gabriel Jesus nodded home. Cancelo would end the game limping. \u201cWe will see how he recovers in the next days,\u201d said Guardiola.</p> <p>Farcically Fulham conceded via precisely the same slipshod manner three minutes later. Michael Hector was dispossessed by Jesus in front of Rodak and the subsequent sequence ended with the Brazilian finishing after the keeper beat out Foden\u2019s effort.</p> <p>Now ended Decordova-Reid\u2019s afternoon, Parker introducing Denis Odoi for him. Yet the manager, really, might have acted more effectively by ordering his team earlier in the half to forget trying to start attacks from the back and so stop City\u2019s high press mugging them.</p> <p>By the final whistle this was as easy an outing as City could have hoped for. Next up is Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s United.</p> <p>\u201cNow we have three days to prepare for them,\u201d said Guardiola.</p>",

The problem is we concede [a] few in some games [this term].\u201d Within six minutes of kick-off, Fulham had lost Tim Ream. The captain pulled Gabriel Jesus over in the area, Kevin Friend pointed to the spot and showed him a red card: double jeopardy activated as he had not tried to play the ball. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan beat Marek Rodak to give City a dream start and a nightmare one for their visitors. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the takers [now],\u201d said Guardiola, City having missed three penalties this season. Fulham\u2019s manager, Scott Parker, said: \u201cThe prep you do goes out of the window after six minutes when you go down to 10 men and they score a goal.\u201d Riyad Mahrez was next to torment Fulham via nifty footwork that ended with him letting fly at Rodak, who saved impressively to his right. Bernardo Silva now got in on the soft-shoe shuffle act, and this time he doubled the lead. From the edge of the area the Portuguese became a one-man carousel spinning a group of Fulham defenders with him, finally turning a last time inside and leaving Ivan Cavaleiro gawping as he rifled in the sweetest of strikes. The contest seemed already over \u2013 any remaining intrigue concerned how many City might score. Guardiola\u2019s men toyed with their opponents, dialling up quality at will, as when Mahrez glided past Joe Bryan, who chopped down the Algerian. Bryan was lucky not to be booked and when Friend blew for the break Fulham could be heartened by having not conceded again. A measure of the one-way traffic, though, was found in them having had three touches in City\u2019s area. The tally for Guardiola\u2019s men had been near-countless. They began the second half with another spurned chance. Angeli\u00f1o traded passes with Phil Foden, then found David Silva inside the area. The captain relayed the ball to Mahrez yet from an inviting angle he blasted high. It had Guardiola grimacing and Mahrez was replaced early in the half \u2013 by Raheem Sterling \u2013 because of a \u201ckick\u201d on the Algerian, the manager explained. Against a backdrop more akin to a summer warm-up game, Fulham\u2019s brightest moment arrived via a free-kick in an advanced position. Stefan Johansen floated the ball in but Cavaleiro bumped into Bernardo Silva and though Parker protested Friend adjudged no foul play. City continued to probe. Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi rolled the ball to Foden, it went to G\u00fcndogan, David Silva and, once more, they could not capitalise. Then, at last, they did. This was simple and derived from Fulham again trying to play out from the back. Bobby Decordova-Reid was caught out close to goal, the ball went to Jo\u00e3o Cancelo and Gabriel Jesus nodded home. Cancelo would end the game limping. \u201cWe will see how he recovers in the next days,\u201d said Guardiola. Farcically Fulham conceded via precisely the same slipshod manner three minutes later. Michael Hector was dispossessed by Jesus in front of Rodak and the subsequent sequence ended with the Brazilian finishing after the keeper beat out Foden\u2019s effort. Now ended Decordova-Reid\u2019s afternoon, Parker introducing Denis Odoi for him. Yet the manager, really, might have acted more effectively by ordering his team earlier in the half to forget trying to start attacks from the back and so stop City\u2019s high press mugging them. By the final whistle this was as easy an outing as City could have hoped for. Next up is Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s United. \u201cNow we have three days to prepare for them,\u201d said Guardiola.",

      "body": "<p>Spencer Stevenson was blessed with thick hair as a young man. He was handsome, too, with blue eyes and a dimpled chin. \u201cThey used to call me the Hoff,\u201d the 44-year-old property manager recalls, referring to the former Baywatch actor and 90s pinup David Hasselhoff.</p> <p>Then, when he was 21, Stevenson\u2019s hairline began to recede and it made him so anxious and depressed that he became a near-recluse. \u201cIt was a constant drain on my personality,\u201d he says. When he shaved off his thinning hair, the celebrity comparisons became less flattering: \u201cThey called me Grant Mitchell.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson\u2019s experience led him to become a mentor for balding men. For 15 years he has run an advice <a href=\"https://www.spexhair.com/\" title=\"\">website, spexhair.com</a>. He also presents The Bald Truth, an online radio call-in show, alongside Spencer Kobren, founder of the American Hair Loss Association. Progress has been steady, if slow, but Stevenson has started to see a shift from the negative notion of hair \u201closs\u201d. \u201cNow all we hear about is hair wellness,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Beyond the threat to his identity and self-esteem, Stevenson says the stigma of balding added to his suffering. With their clinical names and imagery of elderly men with comb-overs, treatments were about as appealing as piles cream. \u201cIt was all ads in the backs of magazines and there was nobody to turn to,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Now an industry built on fear, vanity and unspoken male vulnerability is undergoing a transformation. In rebranding hair loss as hair wellness as part of the broader rise of men\u2019s wellness, treatments are being repackaged as aspirational products for millennials who are primed to talk about their problems.</p> <p>Hilary Coles is cofounder of Hims, a startup that launched in San Francisco in 2017 and in the UK last year. \u201cHims puts together all the pieces of an incredible digital health experience,\u201d says Coles in impeccable marketing speak. <a href=\"https://www.forhims.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Its website</a> looks like a store selling hipster houseplants or mid-century furniture.</p> <p>In common with similar brands that have created the hair wellness market (in the US, where competition is much bigger, they include Keeps, Lemonaid and Nutrafol), Hims does not do much that is new. It has a bigger range in the US, but the UK site is a snazzy shop window for just two products, both of which have been around for years. One is sildenafil, AKA Viagra (Hims is taking on erectile dysfunction along with baldness). The other is finasteride, often branded as Propecia, a medication that inhibits the hormone that may lead to baldness in more than <a href=\"https://www.bad.org.uk/shared/get-file.ashx?id=153&amp;itemtype=document\" title=\"\">half of men</a> over the age of 50.</p> <p>Finasteride is not available on the NHS for hair loss. It does require a prescription, but many pharmacies can issue a private prescription via their own doctors, often after an online consultation to check if the medication is suitable (it can cause side-effects). There is also minoxidil, an over-the-counter medication commonly sold in the UK under the brand name Regaine, which stimulates blood supply to hair follicles.</p> <p>Hims does not even provide its own finasteride pills. In the UK, it has partnered with Croydon-based Cedarwood Pharmacy to supply customers. Hims simply adds the packaging and its website. Following the example of Harry\u2019s, the US shaving firm that turned razor blades into an aspirational subscription service (before it was bought last year by Wilkinson Sword for \u00a31bn), Hims customers subscribe to receive a month\u2019s supply of finasteride (28 pills for \u00a330). The medicine comes in minimalist packaging with no mention of the word \u201cbald\u201d.</p> <p>Coles, an MBA graduate from Canada, says work she did for a charity for injured soldiers schooled her in modern male mores. She says she became aware of the profound difference it made to men when they felt confident, in terms of their jobs and their roles as husbands and fathers. Along with Andrew Dudum, who has founded many startups, she launched Hims (which also sells women\u2019s products under its Hers brand) to tap into the men\u2019s wellness market.</p> <p>Hims, which says it hopes \u201cto enable a conversation that\u2019s currently closeted\u201d, declines to reveal the number of subscriptions it has, but the $100m (\u00a375m) it has raised in funding suggests there is a market for men happy to pay for clever branding. I tell Coles it took me two minutes to find finasteride elsewhere online for half the price Hims charges. \u201cOur ability is to build a relationship with consumers,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re helping more people access these products that will help them, that\u2019s a positive.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson is sceptical about the opportunism of the new purveyors of hair wellness, but supports their mission to improve access. \u201cI had to learn all this the hard way, from insiders in forums who know where to get these medicines at a good price,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s positive that good companies are enabling people to keep their hair the right way.\u201d</p> <p>Quacks bearing useless potions have long filled the shadows in which men traditionally search for balding cures. \u201cThe industry has always been ruthless and brutal in the way it capitalises on vulnerability,\u201d Stevenson says. He credits footballer Wayne Rooney\u2019s headline-grabbing hair transplant in 2011 with beginning to drag the conversation out of the closet. \u201cIt was a turning point because of the way Rooney was so open and happy to talk about it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Stevenson has tried everything himself at least once, and has spent more than \u00a330,000 on hair transplants. He has a thick head of hair to show for it. In the procedure, individual hairs \u2013 or strips of hair \u2013 are extracted from well-served areas of the scalp and planted in the bald patches. As the technology has improved and awareness of the possibility has grown, demand for the procedure has soared. The <a href=\"https://ishrs.org/\" title=\"\">International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery</a> estimated that about <a href=\"https://ishrs.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/report_2017_ishrs_practice_census-08-21-17.pdf\" title=\"\">600,000 procedures</a> took place in 2016, the last year it audited, more than double the figure four years earlier.</p> <p>Stevenson says surgery should be a last resort and advises men to try the shaved look first. \u201cIt will be a lot less time-consuming and emotionally and financially draining than treatment,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause once you start, you have to commit to maintaining it \u2013 it\u2019s like having a fitness-model physique.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, I reveal my own status as a shaved-headed bald man of 37 whose hair started thinning when I was in my 20s, but who could not care less about it. If men are becoming more open about their problems and comfortable in their own bodies, shouldn\u2019t demand for expensive, potentially invasive treatments be declining, however they are packaged? \u201cI still think the vast majority of men would rather keep their hair than not,\u201d Stevenson says.</p> <p>As part of his research for the launch of a new range of slickly branded hair-wellness products, Jamie Stevens, 39, a hairdresser who lives in Buckinghamshire, commissioned a survey of 10,000 men across Europe. \u201cSo many men said they would rather have a small penis than go bald,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said it made them feel less masculine, less attractive, less successful and less powerful.\u201d</p> <p>Stevens, who has one salon in London and another in Surrey, finds the same thing when he talks to his clients. He has had two hair transplants and makes a point of talking openly about balding. \u201cNinety-nine per cent of them have been like: \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s so amazing to be able to talk to someone who knows what it\u2019s like,\u2019\u201d he says.</p> <p>Stevens, who also identified a market for products with minimalist packaging rather than the \u201cshaming\u201d images of the past, launched his own <a href=\"https://mrjamiestevens.com/shop/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0u6osZGc5wIViLTtCh3-fgqYEAAYAiAAEgIAKPD_BwE\" title=\"\">range, MR</a>, in 2017 after three years of development. It includes shampoos that claim to protect hair, as well as colour-matched artificial hair fibres that are sprayed on in a way that disguises loss. Stevens secured a lucrative distribution deal with Boots last year and says he is about to launch in Waitrose.</p> <p>\u201cFor years, it has pissed me off that women can get Botox, boob jobs or wear makeup, yet there is a taboo that men can\u2019t do these things,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now I know more men who have their eyebrows threaded than women.\u201d</p> <p>Stevens wants to launch a Hims-inspired subscription service and plans to open a men\u2019s wellness clinic that will offer help with hair loss, but also body-hair removal, fat reduction and sexual health. Does he not think the rise of hair wellness products and the broader demand among men for cosmetic fixes is, well, depressing, even if it may also be a sign of progress?</p> <p>\u201cI do agree the world would be a much better place if we were all happy with what we have,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it would probably be a poorer place for people who capitalise on insecurity. I know my wife wouldn\u2019t have looked at me differently if I was bald now. But I didn\u2019t do it for her, I did it for me.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Spencer Stevenson was blessed with thick hair as a young man. He was handsome, too, with blue eyes and a dimpled chin. \u201cThey used to call me the Hoff,\u201d the 44-year-old property manager recalls, referring to the former Baywatch actor and 90s pinup David Hasselhoff. Then, when he was 21, Stevenson\u2019s hairline began to recede and it made him so anxious and depressed that he became a near-recluse. \u201cIt was a constant drain on my personality,\u201d he says. When he shaved off his thinning hair, the celebrity comparisons became less flattering: \u201cThey called me Grant Mitchell.\u201d Stevenson\u2019s experience led him to become a mentor for balding men. For 15 years he has run an advice website, spexhair.com. He also presents The Bald Truth, an online radio call-in show, alongside Spencer Kobren, founder of the American Hair Loss Association. Progress has been steady, if slow, but Stevenson has started to see a shift from the negative notion of hair \u201closs\u201d. \u201cNow all we hear about is hair wellness,\u201d he says. Beyond the threat to his identity and self-esteem, Stevenson says the stigma of balding added to his suffering. With their clinical names and imagery of elderly men with comb-overs, treatments were about as appealing as piles cream. \u201cIt was all ads in the backs of magazines and there was nobody to turn to,\u201d he says. Now an industry built on fear, vanity and unspoken male vulnerability is undergoing a transformation. In rebranding hair loss as hair wellness as part of the broader rise of men\u2019s wellness, treatments are being repackaged as aspirational products for millennials who are primed to talk about their problems. Hilary Coles is cofounder of Hims, a startup that launched in San Francisco in 2017 and in the UK last year. \u201cHims puts together all the pieces of an incredible digital health experience,\u201d says Coles in impeccable marketing speak. Its website looks like a store selling hipster houseplants or mid-century furniture. In common with similar brands that have created the hair wellness market (in the US, where competition is much bigger, they include Keeps, Lemonaid and Nutrafol), Hims does not do much that is new. It has a bigger range in the US, but the UK site is a snazzy shop window for just two products, both of which have been around for years. One is sildenafil, AKA Viagra (Hims is taking on erectile dysfunction along with baldness). The other is finasteride, often branded as Propecia, a medication that inhibits the hormone that may lead to baldness in more than half of men over the age of 50. Finasteride is not available on the NHS for hair loss. It does require a prescription, but many pharmacies can issue a private prescription via their own doctors, often after an online consultation to check if the medication is suitable (it can cause side-effects). There is also minoxidil, an over-the-counter medication commonly sold in the UK under the brand name Regaine, which stimulates blood supply to hair follicles. Hims does not even provide its own finasteride pills. In the UK, it has partnered with Croydon-based Cedarwood Pharmacy to supply customers. Hims simply adds the packaging and its website. Following the example of Harry\u2019s, the US shaving firm that turned razor blades into an aspirational subscription service (before it was bought last year by Wilkinson Sword for \u00a31bn), Hims customers subscribe to receive a month\u2019s supply of finasteride (28 pills for \u00a330). The medicine comes in minimalist packaging with no mention of the word \u201cbald\u201d. Coles, an MBA graduate from Canada, says work she did for a charity for injured soldiers schooled her in modern male mores. She says she became aware of the profound difference it made to men when they felt confident, in terms of their jobs and their roles as husbands and fathers. Along with Andrew Dudum, who has founded many startups, she launched Hims (which also sells women\u2019s products under its Hers brand) to tap into the men\u2019s wellness market. Hims, which says it hopes \u201cto enable a conversation that\u2019s currently closeted\u201d, declines to reveal the number of subscriptions it has, but the $100m (\u00a375m) it has raised in funding suggests there is a market for men happy to pay for clever branding. I tell Coles it took me two minutes to find finasteride elsewhere online for half the price Hims charges. \u201cOur ability is to build a relationship with consumers,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re helping more people access these products that will help them, that\u2019s a positive.\u201d Stevenson is sceptical about the opportunism of the new purveyors of hair wellness, but supports their mission to improve access. \u201cI had to learn all this the hard way, from insiders in forums who know where to get these medicines at a good price,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s positive that good companies are enabling people to keep their hair the right way.\u201d Quacks bearing useless potions have long filled the shadows in which men traditionally search for balding cures. \u201cThe industry has always been ruthless and brutal in the way it capitalises on vulnerability,\u201d Stevenson says. He credits footballer Wayne Rooney\u2019s headline-grabbing hair transplant in 2011 with beginning to drag the conversation out of the closet. \u201cIt was a turning point because of the way Rooney was so open and happy to talk about it,\u201d he says. Stevenson has tried everything himself at least once, and has spent more than \u00a330,000 on hair transplants. He has a thick head of hair to show for it. In the procedure, individual hairs \u2013 or strips of hair \u2013 are extracted from well-served areas of the scalp and planted in the bald patches. As the technology has improved and awareness of the possibility has grown, demand for the procedure has soared. The International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery estimated that about 600,000 procedures took place in 2016, the last year it audited, more than double the figure four years earlier. Stevenson says surgery should be a last resort and advises men to try the shaved look first. \u201cIt will be a lot less time-consuming and emotionally and financially draining than treatment,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause once you start, you have to commit to maintaining it \u2013 it\u2019s like having a fitness-model physique.\u201d At this point, I reveal my own status as a shaved-headed bald man of 37 whose hair started thinning when I was in my 20s, but who could not care less about it. If men are becoming more open about their problems and comfortable in their own bodies, shouldn\u2019t demand for expensive, potentially invasive treatments be declining, however they are packaged? \u201cI still think the vast majority of men would rather keep their hair than not,\u201d Stevenson says. As part of his research for the launch of a new range of slickly branded hair-wellness products, Jamie Stevens, 39, a hairdresser who lives in Buckinghamshire, commissioned a survey of 10,000 men across Europe. \u201cSo many men said they would rather have a small penis than go bald,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said it made them feel less masculine, less attractive, less successful and less powerful.\u201d Stevens, who has one salon in London and another in Surrey, finds the same thing when he talks to his clients. He has had two hair transplants and makes a point of talking openly about balding. \u201cNinety-nine per cent of them have been like: \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s so amazing to be able to talk to someone who knows what it\u2019s like,\u2019\u201d he says. Stevens, who also identified a market for products with minimalist packaging rather than the \u201cshaming\u201d images of the past, launched his own range, MR, in 2017 after three years of development. It includes shampoos that claim to protect hair, as well as colour-matched artificial hair fibres that are sprayed on in a way that disguises loss. Stevens secured a lucrative distribution deal with Boots last year and says he is about to launch in Waitrose. \u201cFor years, it has pissed me off that women can get Botox, boob jobs or wear makeup, yet there is a taboo that men can\u2019t do these things,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now I know more men who have their eyebrows threaded than women.\u201d Stevens wants to launch a Hims-inspired subscription service and plans to open a men\u2019s wellness clinic that will offer help with hair loss, but also body-hair removal, fat reduction and sexual health. Does he not think the rise of hair wellness products and the broader demand among men for cosmetic fixes is, well, depressing, even if it may also be a sign of progress? \u201cI do agree the world would be a much better place if we were all happy with what we have,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it would probably be a poorer place for people who capitalise on insecurity. I know my wife wouldn\u2019t have looked at me differently if I was bald now. But I didn\u2019t do it for her, I did it for me.\u201d",

At first glance, the Reubens and the Crown Prince appear unlikely bedfellows but the former held brief preliminary discussions about involvement in Newcastle with Staveley before her failed attempt to buy out Ashley and large parts of their extensive property empire are centred on Tyneside.

He described how he fought for his life and beat Sinaga until he lay motionless on the floor.</p> <p>In an interview <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/student-who-exposed-britains-worst-21361184\">with the Sunday Mirror</a>, he recalled: \u201cI woke up disorientated, face down on a pillow. There was a quilt on the floor. My pants and jeans were down to the top of my knees; he was on top of me with his pants down to his ankles.\u201d</p> <p>The two men began to fight as Sinaga accused Peter of being an intruder. \u201cHe started shouting \u2018Intruder! Intruder!\u2019 I said: \u2018Mate, calm down,\u2019 then he headbutts me on my nose and starts biting me. I was so confused. We were grappling. He pulled me over on to the bed and bit my shoulder,\u201d Peter said.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a scrawny little guy. I was defending myself. I was stronger, I hit him a few times and he dropped to the floor. I was feeling scared. I knew I was in Manchester but that was about it.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI thought I might have killed him, I didn\u2019t really know what I was doing, I was using my instincts and adrenaline to survive.\u201d</p> <p>After escaping Sinaga\u2019s flat, Peter called his mother and asked her to pick him up. Initially Peter was arrested on suspicion of assaulting Sinaga.</p> <p>He spent 11 hours in police cell before detectives discovered that Sinaga had filmed attacks on dozens of unconscious men on his iPhone, including the assault on Peter.</p> <p>Sinaga had been posing as a good Samaritan outside clubs in central Manchester, inviting men back to his flat for a drink or to charge their phones before slipping the date rape drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) into their drink. He then recorded himself raping them, sometimes for hours at a time.</p> <p>Peter described feeling like an \u201caccidental hero\u201d as Sinaga\u2019s crimes may not have been detected had he not accidentally left his phone in Peter\u2019s pocket.</p> <p>Peter said: \u201cThe police and close friends say I\u2019m a hero for stopping the biggest ever rapist. I feel like the accidental hero. If I hadn\u2019t woken he\u2019d still be doing it now.\u201d </p> <p>He said police at first did not believe he had been raped and he was not examined until two days later.</p> <p>He told the Sunday Mirror: \u201cThey took my fingerprints and DNA. They questioned me like an offender, not a victim. He [Sinaga] was in hospital and they told me they would question him when he was released.</p> <p>\u201cI repeatedly said \u2018I think he\u2019s tried to rape me\u2019 but they didn\u2019t do any tests. That\u2019s the one thing I thought wasn\u2019t right at the time.\u201d</p> <p>After Peter handed them Sinaga\u2019s phone, detectives found hundreds of clips of men being abused, and Sinaga was arrested. Peter went on to become a key witness in Sinaga\u2019s trials.</p> <p>Greater Manchester police said they had learned lessons from the case after admitting there were delays in treating Peter as rape victim.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \u201cWe accept samples were not taken expediently in this case and we have since taken steps to strengthen our procedures going forward. Learnings have been cascaded to detectives and will also be incorporated into future policy.\u201d</p>",

Peter, who was 18 at the time, had been plied with a date rape drug and was half-naked when he woke midway through the assault on him. He described how he fought for his life and beat Sinaga until he lay motionless on the floor. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, he recalled: \u201cI woke up disorientated, face down on a pillow. There was a quilt on the floor. My pants and jeans were down to the top of my knees; he was on top of me with his pants down to his ankles.\u201d The two men began to fight as Sinaga accused Peter of being an intruder. \u201cHe started shouting \u2018Intruder! Intruder!\u2019 I said: \u2018Mate, calm down,\u2019 then he headbutts me on my nose and starts biting me. I was so confused. We were grappling. He pulled me over on to the bed and bit my shoulder,\u201d Peter said. \u201cHe was a scrawny little guy. I was defending myself. I was stronger, I hit him a few times and he dropped to the floor. I was feeling scared. I knew I was in Manchester but that was about it.\u201d He added: \u201cI thought I might have killed him, I didn\u2019t really know what I was doing, I was using my instincts and adrenaline to survive.\u201d After escaping Sinaga\u2019s flat, Peter called his mother and asked her to pick him up. Initially Peter was arrested on suspicion of assaulting Sinaga. He spent 11 hours in police cell before detectives discovered that Sinaga had filmed attacks on dozens of unconscious men on his iPhone, including the assault on Peter. Sinaga had been posing as a good Samaritan outside clubs in central Manchester, inviting men back to his flat for a drink or to charge their phones before slipping the date rape drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) into their drink. He then recorded himself raping them, sometimes for hours at a time. Peter described feeling like an \u201caccidental hero\u201d as Sinaga\u2019s crimes may not have been detected had he not accidentally left his phone in Peter\u2019s pocket. Peter said: \u201cThe police and close friends say I\u2019m a hero for stopping the biggest ever rapist. I feel like the accidental hero. If I hadn\u2019t woken he\u2019d still be doing it now.\u201d He said police at first did not believe he had been raped and he was not examined until two days later. He told the Sunday Mirror: \u201cThey took my fingerprints and DNA. They questioned me like an offender, not a victim. He [Sinaga] was in hospital and they told me they would question him when he was released. \u201cI repeatedly said \u2018I think he\u2019s tried to rape me\u2019 but they didn\u2019t do any tests. That\u2019s the one thing I thought wasn\u2019t right at the time.\u201d After Peter handed them Sinaga\u2019s phone, detectives found hundreds of clips of men being abused, and Sinaga was arrested. Peter went on to become a key witness in Sinaga\u2019s trials. Greater Manchester police said they had learned lessons from the case after admitting there were delays in treating Peter as rape victim. A spokesman said: \u201cWe accept samples were not taken expediently in this case and we have since taken steps to strengthen our procedures going forward. Learnings have been cascaded to detectives and will also be incorporated into future policy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The far-right Italian politician Matteo Salvini has threatened to \u201cevict\u201d the national government if his coalition triumphs in two regional elections. Italian newspapers reported a \u201cboom\u201d in turnout \u2013 up 23% in the wealthy northern region of Emilia-Romagna and 10% in Calabria, in the south \u2013 by midday, as voters headed to the polls in elections that could precipitate a return to national power for Salvini\u2019s League. The former deputy prime minister, whose party was ejected from government last summer after he failed to force snap elections, has flouted campaign silence rules with a flurry of tweets. In one, he wrote: \u201cFirst we\u2019ll send them home [in Emilia-Romagna and Calabria] on Sunday and then we\u2019ll give the government of [migrant] landings, taxes and handcuffs an eviction notice.\u201d Emilia-Romagna and Calabria are both led by the centre-left Democratic party (PD), which formed a precarious national alliance with the Five Star Movement (M5S) in September after Salvini\u2019s unsuccessful gambit. Polls before the blackout period began gave Salvini\u2019s group, which includes the smaller far-right Brothers of Italy and Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia, a clear lead in Calabria. The race in Emilia-Romagna is much tighter, with the League\u2019s candidate, Lucia Borgonzoni, neck and neck with the PD\u2019s incumbent regional president, Stefano Bonaccini. However, a defeat for the PD there would be more crushing as the region has been a leftwing bastion since the end of the second world war. Triumphs for Salvini\u2019s coalition would further destabilise the PD-M5S alliance and could lead to a government collapse, as it would probably increase tensions between the coalition partners, with more MPs from both defecting as their faith in the alliance dwindles. That could bring forward general elections that would favour the League, given its leading position in national polls. The resignation of Luigi Di Maio as M5S leader last week has added to the turmoil and Nicola Zingaretti, who leads the PD, may also come under pressure to quit if his party loses the regional votes. Support for each party has waned since the two came together, with the PD polling at 18% and M5S at 16%. The League has maintained a steady lead at about 33%, while support for Brothers of Italy, which is led by Giorgia Meloni, has risen to 10.9% in recent months. Salvini and Meloni have led energetic campaigns across both regions, with their pledges to defend Catholic values, repel unwanted immigration, increase security and cut taxes resonating widely. \u201cIf you give us a hand, on Monday we\u2019ll go and ask for early elections to give this country a strong, coherent government,\u201d Meloni said at a closing rally in Ravenna, Emilia-Romagna, on Friday. The League has already made serious inroads in the region as voters switched allegiances in recent years, managing to capture several small towns before winning its first major city, Ferrara, last June. The Salvini coalition also came first in Emilia-Romagna in national elections in 2018 and again in European parliamentary elections last May. The League\u2019s latest campaign has featured familiar toxic traits, with Salvini sparking an outcry after marching up to a block of flats on the outskirts of Bologna last week and, encouraged by laughing supporters, ringing the bell of a Tunisian family\u2019s home to ask over the intercom if they were drug dealers. At the same time, he has posed for selfies with African immigrants who he claimed were supporters. Many say the League\u2019s true rival in Emilia-Romagna is the Sardines, a movement that emerged in Bologna in mid-November in reaction to Salvini\u2019s threat to \u201cliberate\u201d the region from the left. The movement has managed to mobilise thousands to demonstrations across the country. \u201cThe real match is between the Sardines and Salvini,\u201d Mattia Santori, one of the movement\u2019s founders, said on Thursday.",

Feinberg, a specialist in dispute resolution, was used to calculating how much a life is worth by following the rule of the law. After the many lives lost on September 11th, Feinberg felt a need to do something and when his firm was one of a small number approached by the government, he pushed himself to the front of the line. His job was to allocate the right funds to the right people affected by the attacks and confidently, he developed an equation that would use financial statuses to justly distribute moneys. But how does something so structured allow for the complications of such an event?</p> <p>It\u2019s a fascinatingly complex subject and one which the film avoids tidily packaging for easy consumption. Director Sara Colangelo keeps things murky and difficult as she did in her last film, the criminally underseen psychodrama The Kindergarten Teacher, with a script from Max Borenstein that has us constantly questioning both the morals and the logistics. It\u2019s a weighty topic and one that could have been adapted into an overly dry procedural but instead, we\u2019re forever reminded of the human cost. It\u2019s a film aching with grief but one that chooses not to rely on an overload of sentiment, instead it\u2019s the gently devastating details that pierce through, mostly shared via a series of crushing testimonials from loved ones who lost someone that day. It\u2019s the most effective film I\u2019ve seen to date on the tragedy of 9/11 while also being one of the most sensitive and restrained. There\u2019s barely any footage of the attacks and in one scene, when Feinberg is working while his wife watches news on the political and global fallout, he leaves the room, taking us with him, a sign that this is a story about people first and foremost.</p> <p>Colangelo is a thoughtful, careful film-maker with a keen eye for the specifics of human behaviour and thus populates Worth with living, breathing, emoting people on both sides of the desk. Keaton is on career best form here as a man quietly struggling with a job he entirely underestimated, recalculating everything he thought he knew about his job and what the law means to him. It\u2019s an unflashy performance, the kind that could be too understated for awards attention, much of which will probably be directed at Stanley Tucci, playing a man whose wife died and who is aggravated by the way the fund is being managed. He\u2019s an actor who has grown accustomed to stealing scenes in a supporting role and in the few he has here, including one virtuosic in-office monologue, he\u2019s never been better. The scenes between the pair, as they debate their idea of morality and justice, are exceptional. There\u2019s also excellent work from Amy Ryan, especially in her scenes trying to figure out how to compensate the legally unprotected boyfriend of a man who died in the towers, and Broadway actor Laura Benanti, as a mother figuring out the best way to honour her late firefighting husband.</p> <p>It\u2019s all so human and messy and it\u2019s refreshing to see a director that doesn\u2019t shy away from such complexity with Colangelo crafting a film that\u2019s every bit as nuanced as the subject at hand. In the final scenes, Worth falls into formulaic territory for a brief crowd-pleasing moment but after such subtlety, it\u2019s hard to fault a little indulgence. It premieres at Sundance without a distributor attached as of writing but it\u2019s a film that deserves to be widely seen and appreciated, as tough as it might be in certain scenes, a valid reminder of not only the tragedy itself but of the tragedy of those left behind.</p> <ul> <li><p>Worth is showing at the Sundance film festival with a release date yet to be announced</p></li> </ul>",

It\u2019s a weighty topic and one that could have been adapted into an overly dry procedural but instead, we\u2019re forever reminded of the human cost. It\u2019s a film aching with grief but one that chooses not to rely on an overload of sentiment, instead it\u2019s the gently devastating details that pierce through, mostly shared via a series of crushing testimonials from loved ones who lost someone that day. It\u2019s the most effective film I\u2019ve seen to date on the tragedy of 9/11 while also being one of the most sensitive and restrained. There\u2019s barely any footage of the attacks and in one scene, when Feinberg is working while his wife watches news on the political and global fallout, he leaves the room, taking us with him, a sign that this is a story about people first and foremost. Colangelo is a thoughtful, careful film-maker with a keen eye for the specifics of human behaviour and thus populates Worth with living, breathing, emoting people on both sides of the desk. Keaton is on career best form here as a man quietly struggling with a job he entirely underestimated, recalculating everything he thought he knew about his job and what the law means to him. It\u2019s an unflashy performance, the kind that could be too understated for awards attention, much of which will probably be directed at Stanley Tucci, playing a man whose wife died and who is aggravated by the way the fund is being managed. He\u2019s an actor who has grown accustomed to stealing scenes in a supporting role and in the few he has here, including one virtuosic in-office monologue, he\u2019s never been better. The scenes between the pair, as they debate their idea of morality and justice, are exceptional. There\u2019s also excellent work from Amy Ryan, especially in her scenes trying to figure out how to compensate the legally unprotected boyfriend of a man who died in the towers, and Broadway actor Laura Benanti, as a mother figuring out the best way to honour her late firefighting husband. It\u2019s all so human and messy and it\u2019s refreshing to see a director that doesn\u2019t shy away from such complexity with Colangelo crafting a film that\u2019s every bit as nuanced as the subject at hand. In the final scenes, Worth falls into formulaic territory for a brief crowd-pleasing moment but after such subtlety, it\u2019s hard to fault a little indulgence. It premieres at Sundance without a distributor attached as of writing but it\u2019s a film that deserves to be widely seen and appreciated, as tough as it might be in certain scenes, a valid reminder of not only the tragedy itself but of the tragedy of those left behind. Worth is showing at the Sundance film festival with a release date yet to be announced",

She was being held in Ober</em><em>-Hohenelbe forced labour camp </em><em> when it was liberated from the Nazi</em><em>s in May 1945. She lives in Berlin. It will be the first time she has returned to Auschwitz since her imprisonment.</em></p> \n<p>I\u2019m from a small village in Romania, where about four or five of the families were Jewish, a mix of Romanians and Hungarians. My parents had a mill, and we grew wheat and maize which we turned into flour, as well as sunflowers, which we turned into oil with a press, which was very popular in the area. There was four years of schooling offered for the girls, and 12 for the boys. I told my father when I was 13 that I wanted to study and rather than giving a dowry to my husband\u2019s family, as was the practice, I wanted to invest it in education. My father was happy about it. In the meantime, I trained as a florist. I had dreamed of becoming a pianist or a doctor, but Auschwitz got in the way of all of that.</p> \n<p>At home we spoke both Romanian and Hungarian. We weren\u2019t orthodox Jews, but we did celebrate the festival days and enjoyed them, and went to the synagogue.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba0868bc3a2e00a31c8ffb07a178ee68a1057446\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba0868bc3a2e00a31c8ffb07a178ee68a1057446/0_262_3802_2281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catalina Adam with her son George and her husband\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catalina Adam with her son George and her husband.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Catalina Adam with son George and husband.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>I watch all the documentaries on television about the Nazi era. Last night, there was one about Auschwitz. They talked about how most people had no idea of what was going to happen to them. That might seem strange today, but back then it was quite normal. We didn\u2019t have television, or even radio or a newspaper. Our main source of news was the village crier, who, maybe twice a week, would walk up and down the street with a piece of wood and a hammer, which he knocked on, calling people to attention. One day he declared: \u201cThe people should not go to bed tonight. They should not put on their pyjamas and nightgowns, they should keep their day clothes on and pack a suitcase, because in a few hours a horse and cart will come and pick them up and take them to the next town.\u201d I was 19 when the Hungarians took us away. First to the synagogue. There the women and girls were inspected by the local midwife who was on site to check we were not hiding any precious things, such as jewellery, inside us. She kept apologising, saying she had to do it and she felt ashamed. I desperately wanted to tell her, \u201cI know it\u2019s not your fault that you\u2019re having to do this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Before the Hungarians handed us over to the SS, we were told we had to hand over our jewellery. They told us if you don\u2019t hand it over, we will shoot you. That was the first time we had an idea of what their intentions were. We told them we didn\u2019t have anything else, but someone noticed the earrings I was wearing and screamed at me: \u201cWhy do you need those! Do you think you\u2019ll need them where you\u2019re going!\u201d They shouted \u201cout, out!\u201d and ripped them out of my pierced ears.

The 45-year-olds were considered old, so my mother, Maria, who was 43, was sent to the left with my 12-year-old sister, Aliz. My grandmother too. The only ones remaining were me and my two other sisters, Agi or Agnes, and Edith, the eldest. My father had been sent to work. He was 51. There was no chance for any conversation with my mother. No farewell, even if we had thought we might be seeing each other for the last time. It was all too fast for any of that.</p> \n<p>They shaved all our hair, sent us for a two- or three-minute shower before spraying us with disinfectant.

I\u2019m concerned about the practical side of it apart from anything, like getting her from the airport to the hotel, as she hasn\u2019t travelled anywhere for 10 years.

While precise numbers are still debated, according to the <a href=\"http://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-features/special-focus/liberation-of-auschwitz\">US Holocaust Memorial Museum</a>, the German SS systematically killed at least 960,000 of the 1.1-1.3 million Jews deported to the camp. More people died at Auschwitz than at any other Nazi concentration camp.</p>\n    <p>When the camp was liberated on 27 January 1945, Soviet troops found grisly evidence of the horror. About 7,000 starving prisoners were found alive, and millions of items of clothing that once belonged to men, women and children were discovered along with 6,350kg of human hair.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In January 1942, the Nazi party had decided to roll out the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d. Camps dedicated solely to the extermination of Jews had been created before, but this was formalised by SS Lieut-Gen Reinhard Heydrich in a speech at the Wannsee conference. The extermination camp Auschwitz II was opened in the same year.</p>\n    <p>Auschwitz II had the largest prisoner population of any of the three main camps on the site. In January 1942, the first chamber using lethal Zyklon B gas was built. Four further chambers were built, and these were used for systematic genocide up until November 1944.</p>\n    <p>Auschwitz was also the site of disturbing medical experimentation on Jewish and Roma prisoners, including practices such as castration and sterilisation. SS captain Dr Josef Mengele was one of the physicians practising there.</p>\n    <p>More than 7,000 Nazi personnel are thought to have served at Auschwitz but only a few hundred have been prosecuted for the crimes committed there. The pursuit of justice has not ceased, with German justice officials saying in 2013 that there were 30 surviving Auschwitz officials who should face prosecution.

My mother, who very much liked her future son-in-law, hid it at the back of our house, saying we should look where she was putting it in case we didn\u2019t all come back. My other sisters didn\u2019t want to look, insisting \u201cof course we\u2019ll be back\u201d. For some reason I noticed where she hid it.</p> \n<p>As we left our house we noticed how people were lurking, waiting for us to leave so they could loot our homes.</p> \n<p>First they kept us in the synagogue, then in a ghetto in the next village. There, my 12-year-old brother Moishe had something like a premonition that they would take us to a terrible place. He was screaming at my mum one night, saying he didn\u2019t want to go to wherever they were going to take us.</p> \n<p>Before long they came and told us we were going somewhere else. We should take one suitcase each, filled with our most precious possessions, so we took jewellery and photos, our best clothes. When we arrived in Auschwitz, on cattle cars, they said \u201cleave everything, we\u2019ll bring it to you\u201d. I remember thinking \u201chow will they know what belongs to whom?\u201d</p> \n<p>My mother and brothers were led off to one area, me and my sisters, Rachel and Ibi, to another. As she left us, my mother turned around and shouted: \u201cBut you didn\u2019t have any breakfast!\u201d</p> \n<p>They made us undress, they shaved off our hair. My mother had given my older sister, Rachel, her earrings, containing one big diamond and two smaller ones. She had forgotten to take them off. The woman who shaved her hair tore the earrings from the holes in her ears, while my sister screamed: \u201cThey\u2019re my mother\u2019s!\u201d She said to her: \u201cBe happy we\u2019ve left your head on.\u201d</p> \n<p>We were taken to our barracks, and they brought us some food, in a kind of broken dish. A gruel, which we all had to sip at in turn. It was like for the animals. I couldn\u2019t swallow it. My older sister gave me a kick: \u201cYou have to have it\u2019.\u201d Afterwards we learned to accept what we got.</p> \n<p>Food became an obsession, which we talked about all the time, especially about what my mother used to cook. She was a great baker. I said all I wanted to do if I survived was to see a loaf of her bread on the table.</p> \n<p>We were strong, solid-built country girls, and passed selection to become slave labourers. Josef Mengele, the main camp doctor, had slapped my sister on the back and said: \u201cShe\u2019s well built.\u201d They took blood from all three of us, to use for blood transfusions for wounded German soldiers.</p> \n<p>After three to four months in Auschwitz, I and my sisters were taken to work at a big munitions factory at a place called M\u00e4hrisch Weisswasser in Czechoslovakia. I had small hands, so I was given the task of constructing underground radios. We worked a 12-hour shift.</p> \n<p>When we were liberated, we spent time on a nearby farm, where they fed us up like geese, before we made our way back to Borsa. We shouldn\u2019t have gone home. But for some reason we thought maybe my mother will be there. Lots of people knew what had happened, but we simply didn\u2019t want to believe it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"541bab2b7c624130cc77ebd92d05f249612440ff\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/541bab2b7c624130cc77ebd92d05f249612440ff/206_191_2714_1628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photograph of Auschwitz survivor Edith Gluck, circa 1942 with her sister Rachael before she was imprisoned in Auschwitz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edith Gluck circa 1942 with her sister, Rachel, before she was imprisoned in Auschwitz.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Auschwitz survivor Edith Gluck, circa 1942, with her sister Rachel before she was imprisoned in Auschwitz.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>We found the necklace.

He spent time in numerous camps, and was liberated from a labour camp in Germany in 1945.</em></p> \n<p>I\u2019ve been back to Auschwitz many times. Every time \u2013 and this will be my 14th \u2013 it\u2019s like a terrible video that replays in my mind. The arrival there with my parents, and how we were separated, and obviously I had no idea the fact that they had both been sent to the left meant that they had been sent to their deaths in the gas chambers half an hour after our arrival, which I didn\u2019t find out until after I was liberated. I didn\u2019t stay there long \u2013 only three days \u2013 but it is the last place I saw my parents, so to go back there is to go back to the last place I saw them alive.</p> \n<p>We\u2019d had a very pleasant family life, in Karlovsky Chlumec. The pleasantness evaporated as soon as the <em>\u201cTsuris</em><em>\u201d</em> (Yiddish for troubles) came and we were incarcerated. My father was a wholesaler of alcohol, selling it to the taverns in the town and the surrounding villages. My mother was in charge of our kosher restaurants. It was a central meeting place in the town, and life was busy and interesting. The <em>\u201cTsuris</em><em>\u201d</em> started in school, because the kids would refer to us Jewish kids as \u201cdirty Jews\u2019. When I asked them why they hated us so much, they\u2019d always tell us that we had killed their saviour, Jesus Christ.</p> \n<p>One day, a police officer who was friendly with my father informed us that we were in danger and were going to be rounded up. It was really sudden. The Saturday night, during the Shabbat. Jews were gathered in the synagogue courtyard and taken to the railway station to be transported to a larger ghetto. We were picked up on the Sunday morning. We were in huge shock. My parents had packed our suitcases the night before. The ghetto filled up with Jews from all the surrounding villages. We slept on the floor as there were not enough beds.</p> \n<p>Looking back, my parents must have known more than I did, because they had set up my older brother, Anschel, with fake, Christian papers. He was a redhead and didn\u2019t look like a Jew, and he\u2019d told my dad he\u2019d be able to hide himself in Budapest pretty well. He would have made it until the end of the war, had he not been injured and taken to a Gestapo clinic where they saw he was circumcised. He was lined up with others and shot before being thrown into the Danube.</p> \n<p>I spent only three days in Auschwitz, and I hadn\u2019t realised it then but leaving it was my greatest fortune. We were liberated by the US Army. Some negro guys, as I called them, were the first I saw, who we soon realised were Americans.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31b4907bdec199740e0dac60aa3e8ead9ec94a3f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31b4907bdec199740e0dac60aa3e8ead9ec94a3f/0_475_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ernrst, right, and his surviving siblings and brother in-law after the war\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ernrst, right, and his surviving siblings and brother in-law after the war</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ehrmann family</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Ernest, right, and his surviving siblings and brother-in-law after the war.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>There was a Jewish major in charge of that convoy and he looked at us and was terrified to see the state we were in. We couldn\u2019t speak English, but he was from Brooklyn and spoke Yiddish. When we told him we had been incarcerated by Hitler, he phoned Gen Eisenhower, and asked him what he should do with these Jewish inmates, they\u2019re in a bad way. Eisenhower told him: \u201cI designate you to take care of them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Eventually I and my brother ended up back in our home town. We didn\u2019t stay there long, as the memories were much too raw, and my parents were gone. We ended up in Paris, and eventually got visas for Canada, hoping to go as far away as possible. I never regretted it. Canada was very good and gracious to me, God too.</p> \n<p><em>Ehrmann will be joined on his journey to Auschwitz with his daughter, Audrey Ehrmann, 60, who lives in New York</em><em>:</em></p> \n<p>When we were smaller, my father always told us that during his two and a half days in Auschwitz, he\u2019d gotten more beatings than he did his whole year in multiple concentration camps.</p> \n<p>As his child, I\u2019d beg to differ that he only had nightmares for the first few years. Many nights as an adult, when I came home to visit, I would hear him, struggling in his dreams, murmuring.</p> \n<p>This will be my third time going back to Auschwitz. I feel I have the burden of getting both of my parents\u2019 stories straight so I can retell them. I don\u2019t find it a burden going there, rather I feel like it\u2019s a part of who I am, and part of me learning to tell their story.

Come here and let us spray you with it.\u201d I was really shocked. I went back to my parents and my father took me in his arms. He said: \u201cI know that hurts, but believe me, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Someone has deliberately stoked them up but they\u2019re not to blame.\u201d After the Germans invaded in 1944, we had to wear the yellow star, and I didn\u2019t go to school any more.</p> \n<p>A cousin of my mother\u2019s, from Slovakia, who I called Aunt Piri, came to stay with us, having fled Nazi-occupied Slovakia. Aunt Piri persuaded my mother that it was safe for her to return to Slovakia and that she should take me with her.</p> \n<p>I was under the impression I was going on holiday, and my mother got some forged papers and I had to learn a new name.</p> \n<p>My mother said she and my brother Tamas, who was four years younger, would soon join us. I was 11 and a half. I couldn\u2019t understand why my mother was so upset when we said goodbye, if she was going to join us soon. When she said goodbye to me on the railway platform she squeezed me so hard I could hardly breathe.</p> \n<p>A man smuggled us over the border. He carried my suitcase on his shoulder. I was carrying my doll, Erica, in my hand, vowing I would never let anyone else hold her.</p> \n<p>In Slovakia, I was passed on to maybe three families, who hid me. Then one night we were picked up and taken to an old people\u2019s home in Slovakia, where all the Jews from round about were gathered. I left Erica behind in my bed in the panic. I was still wearing the blue-knitted jacket lined with fur which my mother had made me with a pattern on it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e28856e6588ae6e1cbe98751c43caa4d28a46ef2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e28856e6588ae6e1cbe98751c43caa4d28a46ef2/0_0_1318_782/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eva Szepesi with family\" width=\"1000\" height=\"593\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eva Szepesi with her family</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We were taken by train to Auschwitz. A woman who had lost her daughter took my hand. When we arrived, I remember the masses of people, the SS soldiers with high boots and big barking dogs. Everyone had to get undressed, but I didn\u2019t move because I didn\u2019t want to take off my jacket. The female guard screamed at me so I took it off, and folded it up carefully next to me. She came and flung it away with her foot. I welled up, but I managed to hold back the tears, realising I had nothing to say in the matter.</p> \n<p>I had to put on a striped dress and wooden clogs, no socks, nothing else. They cut off my beautiful plaits and threw them into a pile with the rest of the hair, and then shaved me bald. I was given a tattoo, No 26877, on my left arm. It was 3 November, and as I discovered later we were the first transport in which people were not automatically sent to the gas chambers. Maybe the system was already starting to break down. In any case, I was told not to cry \u201cbecause a tattoo means you\u2019ll live\u201d. I remember a female guard coming up to me and bending down: \u201cYou are 16, and under no circumstances do you let it be known that you are younger than that,\u201d and then she was gone. She was really strict, but she probably saved my life. Later, I realised 16 was the age at which they considered you capable of being able to work. My job was to haul heavy stones and to clean munitions. During the daily so-called <em>Z\u00e4hlappeln</em> \u2013 the roll-calls \u2013 I recall how my feet and hands froze. I suffer from that as a result to this day.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b748ec193cde8dae6b2069420679809e1d8beae9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b748ec193cde8dae6b2069420679809e1d8beae9/0_0_617_814/379.jpg\" alt=\"Eva Szepesi as a young girl\" width=\"379\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eva Szepesi as a young girl</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I spent nearly three months there in total. On 27 January, I was liberated, though I don\u2019t know how I survived that long. When the death marches began when they took the prisoners who could still walk, out of the camp, they thought I was more or less dead, and abandoned me among the dead and dying, lying on my bunk. I was barely conscious and had a fever. I had nothing to drink or eat. I can remember the crying. I remember someone \u2013 I\u2019ve no idea who it was \u2013 coming and feeding me with cold snow. It felt so good. I also remember a Russian soldier bending over me, in a fur hat with a red star on it, and smiling at me.</p> \n<p>My name was sent to the Jewish community in Budapest, and my uncle found my name and said I should come home. I was fully expecting to see my mother and brother, and wondered why my mother wasn\u2019t there at the station to pick me up. I flung my arms around my uncle\u2019s neck, and said: \u201cWhere\u2019s my mother?\u201d He said: \u201cLet\u2019s just wait, she\u2019ll come.\u201d He was so persuasive, I told myself I just had to wait. I didn\u2019t realise then that in May, June and July there had been transports to Auschwitz from my home and the last one was in July. I only found that out years later. I always expected she might come back. I tried to persuade myself that she might have escaped the transports.</p> \n<p>I went back to our house in Pesterzs\u00e9bet with my uncle. We rang a neighbour\u2019s bell and she opened the door and said: \u201cErica, i never thought that any of you would return!\u201d I discovered things that belonged to us in her flat, although she didn\u2019t actually invite us in. She said, before I had even asked: \u201cI bought it all from your mother. I paid her for it.\u201d My uncle said: \u2018\u2018That\u2019s a lie.\u201d She rang my uncle the following day and said she had found photographs she wanted me to have. They were wrapped in newspaper. It was the most precious thing I could have had. I have them on my dresser to this day, I look at them, and even talk to my mother. She, my brother and father are there every time I enter the room.</p> \n<p>I got married and my husband was sent as a tradesman on a mission to Frankfurt in the 1950s. He knew I had been in Auschwitz, and probably wouldn\u2019t want to go to Germany. But then the uprising of 1956 happened, and we hadn\u2019t intended to stay, but ended up doing so. At first I hated it. I couldn\u2019t speak the language and every time I went outside and saw a man in uniform with a dog I was petrified and crossed the road. We didn\u2019t tell anyone my daughter was Jewish until she was seven, because we thought it might endanger her life.</p> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t until 2016 that I discovered for sure that my mother and brother had died in Auschwitz, when my granddaughter discovered their names there in black and white. I sat on a bench as she broke the news to me. I didn\u2019t want to believe her at first. It was terrible. But my daughter said maybe it\u2019s for the best, now you can say goodbye to her and light a candle. I was finally able to start mourning her and my brother. I will be lighting a candle again when I go back there this time. I have no grave to go to, and that is the closest thing to one.</p> \n<p>We first went back to Auschwitz as a family in 2016. We\u2019d planned to spend two days there, but we realised we had a lot of unfinished business there, so we ended up spending a third day there. My son said the Kaddish [prayer recited for the dead], and we walked about and talked, and finally felt like visiting grandma at the cemetery. My mother saw in black and white for the first time that her mother and brother had died there, and we finally found peace in ourselves.</p> \n<p>My son feels a bond with his great uncle, carrying a photo of Tamas, my mother\u2019s brother, in his wallet with him. He has since learned to understand, as we all have, why his grandmother always wants to stuff him with food.</p> \n<p>We recognise our responsibility to ensure this chapter in history is not forgotten, particularly in the light of the rise in antisemitic attacks. After the anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland got into the German parliament in 2017, my mother says that every single person she manages to get through to with her story makes it worthwhile telling it. But when we\u2019ve been even mildly critical of the AfD, we\u2019ve been told \u201cYour Netanyahu is not much better,\u201d as if we don\u2019t belong in Germany, but our home because we\u2019re Jewish, can only be Israel.</p> \n<p>It was shocking when we went back last summer to my mother\u2019s school in Pesterzs\u00e9bet, and tried to find the records of my mother having been a pupil there. But the books covering the years when the Jewish children were deported had been removed, as if they\u2019d tried to wipe out the fact they had ever existed at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6a14a86bb74fd74f0e6502b07ac2bdc9adf284c1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a14a86bb74fd74f0e6502b07ac2bdc9adf284c1/0_138_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gabor Hirsch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hungarian-born Auschwitz survivor Gabor Hirsch visits the former Auschwitz I concentration camp, on 26 January 2015 in Oswiecim, Poland.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>G\u00e1bor Hirsch: \u2018I still retain hope it makes a difference to talk about it\u2019</h2> \n<p><em>G\u00e1bor Hirsch, from B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba in Hungary, was deported to Auschwitz in June 1944.</em></p> \n<p>We were deported at a fairly late stage in the war, when I was 14 and a half. We were forced to leave our home, and were concentrated in a tight living space in May 1944, before being moved to a ghetto the following month, in a storage area that had been used to dry tobacco, where we slept on straw, around 4,000 people packed in together. The hygiene was practically non-existent and there was this crude bar you had to sit on to go to the toilet, balancing carefully so as not to fall into the latrine. It was difficult for everyone but particularly for the elderly, several of whom fell into it.</p> \n<p>A doctor poisoned himself, his wife and their small child because they had probably received certain information about what was facing us.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"6aff4abc12b0bd1a9f2df42d4c81cc741c08e58c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6aff4abc12b0bd1a9f2df42d4c81cc741c08e58c/58_252_650_812/400.jpg\" alt=\"Auschwitz survivor G\u00e1bor Hirsch\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Auschwitz survivor G\u00e1bor Hirsch</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: G\u00e1bor Hirsch</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"125d7b48ae85db12ef6a8168a1676cd8080bfa3b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/125d7b48ae85db12ef6a8168a1676cd8080bfa3b/59_58_458_573/400.jpg\" alt=\"Auschwitz survivor G\u00e1bor Hirsch\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Auschwitz survivor G\u00e1bor Hirsch</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: G\u00e1bor Hirsch</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>G\u00e1bor Hirsch as a young boy.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>On 26 June, 80 to 95 of us were taken in a cattle car, with one bucket containing water, another for toilet needs. Two days later we arrived in Auschwitz-Birkenau. We were each allowed one piece of luggage, and for some reason I took my school satchel. On our arrival, some prisoners asked us to throw things over the fence, telling us we wouldn\u2019t get them back anyway. We didn\u2019t do so, because in our naivety we thought we would get them back as we\u2019d been told.</p> \n<p>When we got out men and women were separated, and then faced selection. I was in a group of men sent to the so-called sauna area. where we were had to undress, all our body hair was removed, and we showered before being covered in disinfectant. We were able to take our shoes, a handkerchief and spectacles. We were given long underpants, a pair of striped trousers, and a jacket and were then sent to our barracks.</p> \n<p>I had the chance to see my mother twice while we were working. Once when we were sent to put up some glass tiles, ahead of the visit of some high-ranking German officers. The women came up to the fence and that was when I saw her. A short conversation took place, I told her I was doing all right, no more than that. I would briefly see her one more time.</p> \n<p>I remained in Auschwitz until the liberation, and stayed longer as I was unfit to go anywhere. I weighed just 27 kilograms. It took two months to feel anything like myself again.</p> \n<p>Probably it was the end of March by the time I arrived in a displaced persons camp in Katowice. I spent some time there, before we were brought to Hungary, arriving on 7 September. At the end of October, the start of November, my father came back. He was able to reopen his shop, so very quickly there was a sense of pseudo-normality again. Before I knew it, I was back to studying with my old schoolmates, almost as if nothing had happened. We were, I suppose, more or less forced to go back to how things \u2018were\u2019. Everyone had endured a certain degree of suffering, so no one was much interested in what I might have been through. But I regret to this day that I never really talked to my father about a lot of things, including the loss of my mother. He married a second time. I knew that my stepmother had been in the first transport of Hungarian Jews, but I didn\u2019t talk to her about it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21b6d64c4d963fc3d66d6cf8eac2851889395118\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21b6d64c4d963fc3d66d6cf8eac2851889395118/0_385_4205_2523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A group of child survivors behind a barbed wire fence at the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau in southern Poland, on the day of the camp\u2019s liberation by the Red Army, 27th January 1945\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gabor is among this group of child survivors at Auschwitz-Birkenau in southern Poland, on the day of the camp\u2019s liberation by the Red Army, 27th January 1945.

It was a real shock to me.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 January 2020. An earlier version misspelled the Budapest suburb of Pesterzs\u00e9bet as Peterszs\u00e9bet.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Five survivors of Auschwitz, one of whom is returning for the first time since her incarceration, have told their stories to the Guardian to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi extermination camp, which is being commemorated on Monday. Aged in their late 80s to mid-90s, they are among the last of a few hundred remaining survivors, and told their stories from their homes in Melbourne, Montreal, Frankfurt, Berlin, and Esslingen, Switzerland. Catalina Adam: \u2018I\u2019m anxious about the trip, but I feel a responsibility beyond myself\u2019 Catalina Adam, 88, from Piscolt, Romania, was deported to Auschwitz in May 1944. She was being held in Ober-Hohenelbe forced labour camp when it was liberated from the Nazis in May 1945. She lives in Berlin. It will be the first time she has returned to Auschwitz since her imprisonment. I\u2019m from a small village in Romania, where about four or five of the families were Jewish, a mix of Romanians and Hungarians. My parents had a mill, and we grew wheat and maize which we turned into flour, as well as sunflowers, which we turned into oil with a press, which was very popular in the area. There was four years of schooling offered for the girls, and 12 for the boys. I told my father when I was 13 that I wanted to study and rather than giving a dowry to my husband\u2019s family, as was the practice, I wanted to invest it in education. My father was happy about it. In the meantime, I trained as a florist. I had dreamed of becoming a pianist or a doctor, but Auschwitz got in the way of all of that. At home we spoke both Romanian and Hungarian. We weren\u2019t orthodox Jews, but we did celebrate the festival days and enjoyed them, and went to the synagogue. Catalina Adam with son George and husband. I watch all the documentaries on television about the Nazi era. Last night, there was one about Auschwitz. They talked about how most people had no idea of what was going to happen to them. That might seem strange today, but back then it was quite normal. We didn\u2019t have television, or even radio or a newspaper. Our main source of news was the village crier, who, maybe twice a week, would walk up and down the street with a piece of wood and a hammer, which he knocked on, calling people to attention. One day he declared: \u201cThe people should not go to bed tonight. They should not put on their pyjamas and nightgowns, they should keep their day clothes on and pack a suitcase, because in a few hours a horse and cart will come and pick them up and take them to the next town.\u201d I was 19 when the Hungarians took us away. First to the synagogue. There the women and girls were inspected by the local midwife who was on site to check we were not hiding any precious things, such as jewellery, inside us. She kept apologising, saying she had to do it and she felt ashamed. I desperately wanted to tell her, \u201cI know it\u2019s not your fault that you\u2019re having to do this.\u201d Before the Hungarians handed us over to the SS, we were told we had to hand over our jewellery. They told us if you don\u2019t hand it over, we will shoot you. That was the first time we had an idea of what their intentions were. We told them we didn\u2019t have anything else, but someone noticed the earrings I was wearing and screamed at me: \u201cWhy do you need those! Do you think you\u2019ll need them where you\u2019re going!\u201d They shouted \u201cout, out!\u201d and ripped them out of my pierced ears. Since then I\u2019ve never been able to bring myself to wear earrings. Portraits of Catalina Adam as a young woman. Before we had even arrived at Auschwitz we were advised to make a pre-selection \u2013 the older people should take the young ones \u2013 though we didn\u2019t know what for. The 45-year-olds were considered old, so my mother, Maria, who was 43, was sent to the left with my 12-year-old sister, Aliz. My grandmother too. The only ones remaining were me and my two other sisters, Agi or Agnes, and Edith, the eldest. My father had been sent to work. He was 51. There was no chance for any conversation with my mother. No farewell, even if we had thought we might be seeing each other for the last time. It was all too fast for any of that. They shaved all our hair, sent us for a two- or three-minute shower before spraying us with disinfectant. They threw clothes at us not taking any account of whether they would fit or not. When we emerged outside and looked at each other, we couldn\u2019t laugh or cry. We were expressionless and didn\u2019t recognise each other any more. Catalina Adam\u2019s father, and her mother, Maria Sicherman. Today I remain haunted by the idea of my mother and baby sister going into the gas chambers, each of them asking the other what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s happening, as they choked on the gas. I can\u2019t get it out of my head. We were given dehydrated vegetables in water to eat. We had to share a bowl of it between five of us. The first would slurp from it and hand it on, and when it got to the end it would be sent back to the beginning. It was so awful I couldn\u2019t eat it, even though the men threw messages over to us, saying be sure to eat the food. Eventually I was given some medicine by a doctor which gave me a raging appetite, otherwise I would have perished very quickly. My father might have survived, but I found out later from an acquaintance in a village close to ours that a commando had come to his barracks and asked \u201cwho wants another, better work? If so, come with us.\u201d He fell for their trick, and was murdered. They told us he had always been so tired. After work he\u2019d cry and constantly looked at pictures of his family he had hidden in the bottom of his shoes. In September, about 400 of us were sent from Auschwitz to the Schaub Lorenz factory close to Prague to work as slave labourers where we made tubes for radios and other electrical equipment. It was there that we were liberated. Catalina Adam with her sisters. We arrived back in Piskolt in June 1945, and rang on many bells. Our flat was empty. The door was open and we were able to inhabit it, which was better than for lots of people who were told \u201cwe\u2019ve taken over your property now\u201d. We found our possessions scattered in homes across the village, and managed to get some of them back. I\u2019m quite anxious about the trip, I must admit, but when I spoke to my older sister, Agi, who just died last week in Israel, about my plans, she said: \u201cI think it\u2019s good you\u2019re going there, you\u2019ve spent such a lot of your life talking about it. You can light a candle for Mama and little Aliz and everyone else.\u201d So I feel a responsibility beyond myself. George Adam, 64, will accompany his mother to Auschwitz, for the first time: I knew from an early age that my mother had been in Auschwitz. It seems to me that every incident in her life had a connection of some sort to it \u2013 buying a kitchen, a carpet, deciding what to eat, she would always relate it to her experience in Auschwitz. Now I will return with her for the first time since she was imprisoned there. I\u2019m concerned about the practical side of it apart from anything, like getting her from the airport to the hotel, as she hasn\u2019t travelled anywhere for 10 years. But I think it\u2019s really important, both for her and for me, and for her grandchildren, who have also grown up with the story and recognise it as part of their own story and who will go back to Auschwitz one day on their grandmother\u2019s behalf. Edith Gluck: \u2018We had no idea what was in store for us\u2019 Edith Gluck, 92, an ethnic Hungarian from Borsa, Transylvania (Romania), and her family were deported to Auschwitz in June 1944. She was transferred to M\u00e4hrisch Weisswasser labour camp in Czechoslovakia in November 1944, where she remained until it was liberated. She now lives in Melbourne, Australia, and will return to Auschwitz for the first time this week. I realised, looking back, that there was a lot of hatred towards us way before our deportation. I remember one Easter, some young guys coming from the church and how one of them came over to my sister who was sitting on our front step, and slapped her in the face saying: \u201cour priest just told us, you killed Jesus.\u201d We accepted the animosity as a part of normal life but had no idea what was in store for us. My older sister was engaged, her fiancee had given her a beautiful necklace with an angel on it. My mother, who very much liked her future son-in-law, hid it at the back of our house, saying we should look where she was putting it in case we didn\u2019t all come back. My other sisters didn\u2019t want to look, insisting \u201cof course we\u2019ll be back\u201d. For some reason I noticed where she hid it. As we left our house we noticed how people were lurking, waiting for us to leave so they could loot our homes. First they kept us in the synagogue, then in a ghetto in the next village. There, my 12-year-old brother Moishe had something like a premonition that they would take us to a terrible place. He was screaming at my mum one night, saying he didn\u2019t want to go to wherever they were going to take us. Before long they came and told us we were going somewhere else. We should take one suitcase each, filled with our most precious possessions, so we took jewellery and photos, our best clothes. When we arrived in Auschwitz, on cattle cars, they said \u201cleave everything, we\u2019ll bring it to you\u201d. I remember thinking \u201chow will they know what belongs to whom?\u201d My mother and brothers were led off to one area, me and my sisters, Rachel and Ibi, to another. As she left us, my mother turned around and shouted: \u201cBut you didn\u2019t have any breakfast!\u201d They made us undress, they shaved off our hair. My mother had given my older sister, Rachel, her earrings, containing one big diamond and two smaller ones. She had forgotten to take them off. The woman who shaved her hair tore the earrings from the holes in her ears, while my sister screamed: \u201cThey\u2019re my mother\u2019s!\u201d She said to her: \u201cBe happy we\u2019ve left your head on.\u201d We were taken to our barracks, and they brought us some food, in a kind of broken dish. A gruel, which we all had to sip at in turn. It was like for the animals. I couldn\u2019t swallow it. My older sister gave me a kick: \u201cYou have to have it\u2019.\u201d Afterwards we learned to accept what we got. Food became an obsession, which we talked about all the time, especially about what my mother used to cook. She was a great baker. I said all I wanted to do if I survived was to see a loaf of her bread on the table. We were strong, solid-built country girls, and passed selection to become slave labourers. Josef Mengele, the main camp doctor, had slapped my sister on the back and said: \u201cShe\u2019s well built.\u201d They took blood from all three of us, to use for blood transfusions for wounded German soldiers. After three to four months in Auschwitz, I and my sisters were taken to work at a big munitions factory at a place called M\u00e4hrisch Weisswasser in Czechoslovakia. I had small hands, so I was given the task of constructing underground radios. We worked a 12-hour shift. When we were liberated, we spent time on a nearby farm, where they fed us up like geese, before we made our way back to Borsa. We shouldn\u2019t have gone home. But for some reason we thought maybe my mother will be there. Lots of people knew what had happened, but we simply didn\u2019t want to believe it. Auschwitz survivor Edith Gluck, circa 1942, with her sister Rachel before she was imprisoned in Auschwitz. We found the necklace. I went right there to where my mother had hidden it, behind two bricks. It was like a memory of my mother, knowing the last time it had been touched had been in her hands. I kissed it. The house was empty. They had taken everything including all our old handmade embroidery tablecloths and crochet work. The timber was removed from the windows, papers were strewn everywhere. I moved to various places, including Czechoslovakia, Ireland and Israel, where I met my husband, who was also from Hungary. But he persuaded me we should make our home in Australia where there was no warring. Edith Gluck, in 1947 in Dublin after she escaped Auschwitz, and in 1956 in Israel. I lost my mother, younger sister and two little brothers in Auschwitz, and when I return there I see it as a chance to finally say goodbye to them. After all, I have no cemetery where I can go to see them. I\u2019m going to light some candles and listen to the prayer for the dead. There are lots of nights these days when I can\u2019t sleep and I see my family, when we arrived and they separated us. I just have to close my eyes, and I see in front of me my mother turning round and saying: \u201cBut you didn\u2019t have breakfast.\u201d I think it was a deliberate decision for my Mum and Dad to move as far away from Europe as possible, to separate themselves. When I think about it, they probably suffered from PTSD. My mother never seemed to be weighed down by it like some people I know, although food was an obsession \u2013 making sure I always had a lot. I was a skinny child and my mother couldn\u2019t stand that. I don\u2019t know how she\u2019ll react when we\u2019re actually there. We\u2019ve sometimes watched movies about it, and she\u2019s said: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly like the bunk I was in. We were at the bottom.\u201d But when she\u2019s there for real, I hope she\u2019ll be able to go through with it. For my part, I want to be able to stand outside the gates and say: \u2018F-you, Hitler, I\u2019m still here, it didn\u2019t work!\u2019\u201d Ernest Ehrmann: \u2018To go back there is to go back to the last place I saw my parents alive\u2019 Ernest Ehrmann, 91, from Karlovsky Chlumec in Czechoslovakia, was deported in 1944 to Auschwitz, where he spent three days before being moved to Warsaw, where he was given the job of cleaning out the ghetto after the uprising. He spent time in numerous camps, and was liberated from a labour camp in Germany in 1945. I\u2019ve been back to Auschwitz many times. Every time \u2013 and this will be my 14th \u2013 it\u2019s like a terrible video that replays in my mind. The arrival there with my parents, and how we were separated, and obviously I had no idea the fact that they had both been sent to the left meant that they had been sent to their deaths in the gas chambers half an hour after our arrival, which I didn\u2019t find out until after I was liberated. I didn\u2019t stay there long \u2013 only three days \u2013 but it is the last place I saw my parents, so to go back there is to go back to the last place I saw them alive. We\u2019d had a very pleasant family life, in Karlovsky Chlumec. The pleasantness evaporated as soon as the \u201cTsuris\u201d (Yiddish for troubles) came and we were incarcerated. My father was a wholesaler of alcohol, selling it to the taverns in the town and the surrounding villages. My mother was in charge of our kosher restaurants. It was a central meeting place in the town, and life was busy and interesting. The \u201cTsuris\u201d started in school, because the kids would refer to us Jewish kids as \u201cdirty Jews\u2019. When I asked them why they hated us so much, they\u2019d always tell us that we had killed their saviour, Jesus Christ. One day, a police officer who was friendly with my father informed us that we were in danger and were going to be rounded up. It was really sudden. The Saturday night, during the Shabbat. Jews were gathered in the synagogue courtyard and taken to the railway station to be transported to a larger ghetto. We were picked up on the Sunday morning. We were in huge shock. My parents had packed our suitcases the night before. The ghetto filled up with Jews from all the surrounding villages. We slept on the floor as there were not enough beds. Looking back, my parents must have known more than I did, because they had set up my older brother, Anschel, with fake, Christian papers. He was a redhead and didn\u2019t look like a Jew, and he\u2019d told my dad he\u2019d be able to hide himself in Budapest pretty well. He would have made it until the end of the war, had he not been injured and taken to a Gestapo clinic where they saw he was circumcised. He was lined up with others and shot before being thrown into the Danube. I spent only three days in Auschwitz, and I hadn\u2019t realised it then but leaving it was my greatest fortune. We were liberated by the US Army. Some negro guys, as I called them, were the first I saw, who we soon realised were Americans. Ernest, right, and his surviving siblings and brother-in-law after the war. There was a Jewish major in charge of that convoy and he looked at us and was terrified to see the state we were in. We couldn\u2019t speak English, but he was from Brooklyn and spoke Yiddish. When we told him we had been incarcerated by Hitler, he phoned Gen Eisenhower, and asked him what he should do with these Jewish inmates, they\u2019re in a bad way. Eisenhower told him: \u201cI designate you to take care of them.\u201d Eventually I and my brother ended up back in our home town. We didn\u2019t stay there long, as the memories were much too raw, and my parents were gone. We ended up in Paris, and eventually got visas for Canada, hoping to go as far away as possible. I never regretted it. Canada was very good and gracious to me, God too. Ehrmann will be joined on his journey to Auschwitz with his daughter, Audrey Ehrmann, 60, who lives in New York: When we were smaller, my father always told us that during his two and a half days in Auschwitz, he\u2019d gotten more beatings than he did his whole year in multiple concentration camps. As his child, I\u2019d beg to differ that he only had nightmares for the first few years. Many nights as an adult, when I came home to visit, I would hear him, struggling in his dreams, murmuring. This will be my third time going back to Auschwitz. I feel I have the burden of getting both of my parents\u2019 stories straight so I can retell them. I don\u2019t find it a burden going there, rather I feel like it\u2019s a part of who I am, and part of me learning to tell their story. I gain more understanding each time, but it doesn\u2019t get any less upsetting. Eva Szepesi: \u2018We recognise our responsibility to ensure this chapter in history is not forgotten\u2019 Eva Szepesi, from Budapest, Hungary, was captured in Slovakia in September 1944 and deported from a nursing home to Sered concentration camp and from there to Auschwitz. She was liberated in 1945. Now 87, she lives in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Life was happy and normal, but one incident sticks in my head that was like a turning point. My Dad had sent me out to buy cigarettes, it must have been around 1940, and someone in the courtyard of our flat in Pesterzs\u00e9bet, a suburb of Budapest, was washing a piece of raw meat under the tap. They called me over, and said: \u201cWhat are you staring at, Jew girl? Soon the blood will flow out of your dad just like it is from this meat. Come here and let us spray you with it.\u201d I was really shocked. I went back to my parents and my father took me in his arms. He said: \u201cI know that hurts, but believe me, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Someone has deliberately stoked them up but they\u2019re not to blame.\u201d After the Germans invaded in 1944, we had to wear the yellow star, and I didn\u2019t go to school any more. A cousin of my mother\u2019s, from Slovakia, who I called Aunt Piri, came to stay with us, having fled Nazi-occupied Slovakia. Aunt Piri persuaded my mother that it was safe for her to return to Slovakia and that she should take me with her. I was under the impression I was going on holiday, and my mother got some forged papers and I had to learn a new name. My mother said she and my brother Tamas, who was four years younger, would soon join us. I was 11 and a half. I couldn\u2019t understand why my mother was so upset when we said goodbye, if she was going to join us soon. When she said goodbye to me on the railway platform she squeezed me so hard I could hardly breathe. A man smuggled us over the border. He carried my suitcase on his shoulder. I was carrying my doll, Erica, in my hand, vowing I would never let anyone else hold her. In Slovakia, I was passed on to maybe three families, who hid me. Then one night we were picked up and taken to an old people\u2019s home in Slovakia, where all the Jews from round about were gathered. I left Erica behind in my bed in the panic. I was still wearing the blue-knitted jacket lined with fur which my mother had made me with a pattern on it. We were taken by train to Auschwitz. A woman who had lost her daughter took my hand. When we arrived, I remember the masses of people, the SS soldiers with high boots and big barking dogs. Everyone had to get undressed, but I didn\u2019t move because I didn\u2019t want to take off my jacket. The female guard screamed at me so I took it off, and folded it up carefully next to me. She came and flung it away with her foot. I welled up, but I managed to hold back the tears, realising I had nothing to say in the matter. I had to put on a striped dress and wooden clogs, no socks, nothing else. They cut off my beautiful plaits and threw them into a pile with the rest of the hair, and then shaved me bald. I was given a tattoo, No 26877, on my left arm. It was 3 November, and as I discovered later we were the first transport in which people were not automatically sent to the gas chambers. Maybe the system was already starting to break down. In any case, I was told not to cry \u201cbecause a tattoo means you\u2019ll live\u201d. I remember a female guard coming up to me and bending down: \u201cYou are 16, and under no circumstances do you let it be known that you are younger than that,\u201d and then she was gone. She was really strict, but she probably saved my life. Later, I realised 16 was the age at which they considered you capable of being able to work. My job was to haul heavy stones and to clean munitions. During the daily so-called Z\u00e4hlappeln \u2013 the roll-calls \u2013 I recall how my feet and hands froze. I suffer from that as a result to this day. I spent nearly three months there in total. On 27 January, I was liberated, though I don\u2019t know how I survived that long. When the death marches began when they took the prisoners who could still walk, out of the camp, they thought I was more or less dead, and abandoned me among the dead and dying, lying on my bunk. I was barely conscious and had a fever. I had nothing to drink or eat. I can remember the crying. I remember someone \u2013 I\u2019ve no idea who it was \u2013 coming and feeding me with cold snow. It felt so good. I also remember a Russian soldier bending over me, in a fur hat with a red star on it, and smiling at me. My name was sent to the Jewish community in Budapest, and my uncle found my name and said I should come home. I was fully expecting to see my mother and brother, and wondered why my mother wasn\u2019t there at the station to pick me up. I flung my arms around my uncle\u2019s neck, and said: \u201cWhere\u2019s my mother?\u201d He said: \u201cLet\u2019s just wait, she\u2019ll come.\u201d He was so persuasive, I told myself I just had to wait. I didn\u2019t realise then that in May, June and July there had been transports to Auschwitz from my home and the last one was in July. I only found that out years later. I always expected she might come back. I tried to persuade myself that she might have escaped the transports. I went back to our house in Pesterzs\u00e9bet with my uncle. We rang a neighbour\u2019s bell and she opened the door and said: \u201cErica, i never thought that any of you would return!\u201d I discovered things that belonged to us in her flat, although she didn\u2019t actually invite us in. She said, before I had even asked: \u201cI bought it all from your mother. I paid her for it.\u201d My uncle said: \u2018\u2018That\u2019s a lie.\u201d She rang my uncle the following day and said she had found photographs she wanted me to have. They were wrapped in newspaper. It was the most precious thing I could have had. I have them on my dresser to this day, I look at them, and even talk to my mother. She, my brother and father are there every time I enter the room. I got married and my husband was sent as a tradesman on a mission to Frankfurt in the 1950s. He knew I had been in Auschwitz, and probably wouldn\u2019t want to go to Germany. But then the uprising of 1956 happened, and we hadn\u2019t intended to stay, but ended up doing so. At first I hated it. I couldn\u2019t speak the language and every time I went outside and saw a man in uniform with a dog I was petrified and crossed the road. We didn\u2019t tell anyone my daughter was Jewish until she was seven, because we thought it might endanger her life. It wasn\u2019t until 2016 that I discovered for sure that my mother and brother had died in Auschwitz, when my granddaughter discovered their names there in black and white. I sat on a bench as she broke the news to me. I didn\u2019t want to believe her at first. It was terrible. But my daughter said maybe it\u2019s for the best, now you can say goodbye to her and light a candle. I was finally able to start mourning her and my brother. I will be lighting a candle again when I go back there this time. I have no grave to go to, and that is the closest thing to one. We first went back to Auschwitz as a family in 2016. We\u2019d planned to spend two days there, but we realised we had a lot of unfinished business there, so we ended up spending a third day there. My son said the Kaddish [prayer recited for the dead], and we walked about and talked, and finally felt like visiting grandma at the cemetery. My mother saw in black and white for the first time that her mother and brother had died there, and we finally found peace in ourselves. My son feels a bond with his great uncle, carrying a photo of Tamas, my mother\u2019s brother, in his wallet with him. He has since learned to understand, as we all have, why his grandmother always wants to stuff him with food. We recognise our responsibility to ensure this chapter in history is not forgotten, particularly in the light of the rise in antisemitic attacks. After the anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland got into the German parliament in 2017, my mother says that every single person she manages to get through to with her story makes it worthwhile telling it. But when we\u2019ve been even mildly critical of the AfD, we\u2019ve been told \u201cYour Netanyahu is not much better,\u201d as if we don\u2019t belong in Germany, but our home because we\u2019re Jewish, can only be Israel. It was shocking when we went back last summer to my mother\u2019s school in Pesterzs\u00e9bet, and tried to find the records of my mother having been a pupil there. But the books covering the years when the Jewish children were deported had been removed, as if they\u2019d tried to wipe out the fact they had ever existed at all. G\u00e1bor Hirsch: \u2018I still retain hope it makes a difference to talk about it\u2019 G\u00e1bor Hirsch, from B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba in Hungary, was deported to Auschwitz in June 1944. We were deported at a fairly late stage in the war, when I was 14 and a half. We were forced to leave our home, and were concentrated in a tight living space in May 1944, before being moved to a ghetto the following month, in a storage area that had been used to dry tobacco, where we slept on straw, around 4,000 people packed in together. The hygiene was practically non-existent and there was this crude bar you had to sit on to go to the toilet, balancing carefully so as not to fall into the latrine. It was difficult for everyone but particularly for the elderly, several of whom fell into it. A doctor poisoned himself, his wife and their small child because they had probably received certain information about what was facing us. G\u00e1bor Hirsch as a young boy. On 26 June, 80 to 95 of us were taken in a cattle car, with one bucket containing water, another for toilet needs. Two days later we arrived in Auschwitz-Birkenau. We were each allowed one piece of luggage, and for some reason I took my school satchel. On our arrival, some prisoners asked us to throw things over the fence, telling us we wouldn\u2019t get them back anyway. We didn\u2019t do so, because in our naivety we thought we would get them back as we\u2019d been told. When we got out men and women were separated, and then faced selection. I was in a group of men sent to the so-called sauna area. where we were had to undress, all our body hair was removed, and we showered before being covered in disinfectant. We were able to take our shoes, a handkerchief and spectacles. We were given long underpants, a pair of striped trousers, and a jacket and were then sent to our barracks. I had the chance to see my mother twice while we were working. Once when we were sent to put up some glass tiles, ahead of the visit of some high-ranking German officers. The women came up to the fence and that was when I saw her. A short conversation took place, I told her I was doing all right, no more than that. I would briefly see her one more time. I remained in Auschwitz until the liberation, and stayed longer as I was unfit to go anywhere. I weighed just 27 kilograms. It took two months to feel anything like myself again. Probably it was the end of March by the time I arrived in a displaced persons camp in Katowice. I spent some time there, before we were brought to Hungary, arriving on 7 September. At the end of October, the start of November, my father came back. He was able to reopen his shop, so very quickly there was a sense of pseudo-normality again. Before I knew it, I was back to studying with my old schoolmates, almost as if nothing had happened. We were, I suppose, more or less forced to go back to how things \u2018were\u2019. Everyone had endured a certain degree of suffering, so no one was much interested in what I might have been through. But I regret to this day that I never really talked to my father about a lot of things, including the loss of my mother. He married a second time. I knew that my stepmother had been in the first transport of Hungarian Jews, but I didn\u2019t talk to her about it. Gabor is among this group of child survivors at Auschwitz on the day of the camp\u2019s liberation by the Red Army, 27 January 1945. He is hidden behind the boy with the white head bandage. I was happy to be able to escape to Budapest and start studying as a technical engineer. I continued to harbour the hope for years that my mother might yet come home. When I go to talk to children in schools, I want them to understand that exclusion is wrong, whatever form it takes, whether homophobia or antisemitism, and that it has consequences. I sometimes feel a bit like Don Quixote, fighting against windmills, as if it\u2019s all in vain, but I still retain hope that it makes a difference to talk about it. It wasn\u2019t for decades that I discovered what had happened to my mother. I had heard from a cousin who was in the same camp that on 25 September there had been a selection after which I believed, for decades, she must have died. But years later, in 1993, I submitted an information application with the International Tracing Service in Bad Arolsen and five years after that, in 1998, a letter arrived in which they said they regretted to inform me that my mother had been registered in the Stutthof concentration camp on 8 September, and had died on 18 December 1944, cause of death unknown. It was a real shock to me. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 January 2020. An earlier version misspelled the Budapest suburb of Pesterzs\u00e9bet as Peterszs\u00e9bet.",

There\u2019s certainly an irony that more than a quarter of a century after his death an arts body is seeking to raise millions to preserve his house, when during his lifetime he faced a constant battle to finance his films.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Making Prospect Cottage a space to transform lives seems to me to be a wonderful way of furthering Jarman's legacy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Film-maker, painter, gardener, writer and activist, Jarman moved to the wind-blasted 12 sq miles (31 sq km) of pebbles, shingle and scrub that makes up the Dungeness peninsula in the late 1980s. Prospect Cottage wasn\u2019t merely a place of respite, as he faced the physical ordeal of his illness. He also turned this modest dwelling into an artwork in its own right. Words from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/oct/05/john-donne-the-sun-rising\" title=\"\">John Donne\u2019s The Sun Rising</a> cover an external wall, beyond which Jarman created a now world-famous garden where sculptures made from the flotsam and jetsam of the Dungeness shore were given as much prominence as the crocuses, holly, roses and poppies that he planted.</p> <p>It was to be where he created some of his best work. The cottage and surrounding landscape provided the backdrop for his 1990 film The Garden, a visionary, psychedelic and angry polemic that retells the life of Jesus as a parable for the persecution of gay men during the Aids epidemic. His journal of these years was eventually published as a book called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/olivia-laing-derek-jarman-modern-nature\" title=\"\">Modern Nature</a>, a classic of contemporary nature writing that eschews the twee romanticism of the genre for an evocative and honest account of sexuality and illness set against the struggle to keep his garden alive.</p> <p>Jarman\u2019s creative output was diffuse. His films are rarely widely screened or shown on television, while the paintings he made at Prospect Cottage (small canvases loaded with black tar and items collected from the surrounding landscape) are only occasionally exhibited, and usually in commercial galleries before being sold to private collectors.

      "bodyText": "In 1992 Derek Jarman, seriously ill with HIV, was asked what his memorial might be. \u201cOh, nothing,\u201d he replied, \u201cbecause film disappears, thank God.\u201d It might seem strange to think of Jarman\u2019s joy in the transience of his art in the context of a recently launched Art Fund campaign to raise \u00a33.5m in 10 weeks to purchase and save Prospect Cottage, his home and workplace in Dungeness, Kent. There\u2019s certainly an irony that more than a quarter of a century after his death an arts body is seeking to raise millions to preserve his house, when during his lifetime he faced a constant battle to finance his films. Film-maker, painter, gardener, writer and activist, Jarman moved to the wind-blasted 12 sq miles (31 sq km) of pebbles, shingle and scrub that makes up the Dungeness peninsula in the late 1980s. Prospect Cottage wasn\u2019t merely a place of respite, as he faced the physical ordeal of his illness. He also turned this modest dwelling into an artwork in its own right. Words from John Donne\u2019s The Sun Rising cover an external wall, beyond which Jarman created a now world-famous garden where sculptures made from the flotsam and jetsam of the Dungeness shore were given as much prominence as the crocuses, holly, roses and poppies that he planted. It was to be where he created some of his best work. The cottage and surrounding landscape provided the backdrop for his 1990 film The Garden, a visionary, psychedelic and angry polemic that retells the life of Jesus as a parable for the persecution of gay men during the Aids epidemic. His journal of these years was eventually published as a book called Modern Nature, a classic of contemporary nature writing that eschews the twee romanticism of the genre for an evocative and honest account of sexuality and illness set against the struggle to keep his garden alive. Jarman\u2019s creative output was diffuse. His films are rarely widely screened or shown on television, while the paintings he made at Prospect Cottage (small canvases loaded with black tar and items collected from the surrounding landscape) are only occasionally exhibited, and usually in commercial galleries before being sold to private collectors. Prospect Cottage, then, is the most accessible and easily identifiable manifestation we have of Jarman\u2019s creative energies. Since his death in 1994, the cottage was cared for and maintained by his partner, Keith Collins, who died in 2018. The intensity of the Dungeness weather that Jarman so beautifully captured both on celluloid and in words now threatens the very existence of his former home. Gales laden with salt spray and the heat and strong sunlight of the Kentish summer are enemies of the wooden building, while the increasing stream of visitors who wander through the garden and peer through the windows bring with them their own risks of wear and tear, souvenir-hunting or even robbery. In the final months of his life, Collins approached the artist Tacita Dean with his concern for the future of the property.

Yet memory and cold buildings preserved in aspic are not enough. What makes the plans for Prospect Cottage more than an attempt to turn it into a heritage tourist attraction, cream teas on hand, is an ambitious proposal to open it as a creative retreat for artists, filmmakers, writers and activists.

But sex that\u2019s just OK can sustain us and keep us connected.\u201d",

What we have for sure is the world number 1, Ashleigh Barty, playing in her home Grand Slam \u2013 she meets the late-blooming Alison Riske who, at the ancient age of 28 (or was she 29?) has just enjoyed the best year of her career. Included in that year was a run to the Wimbledon quarterfinals, included in that run a win over Barty. That one will be decent. </p> <p><br>Then, when that\u2019s done, we get to enjoy Roger Federer, and who knows for how much longer that\u2019ll be so. He\u2019s not looked especially good so far and needed a super-duper tie-break to shake off the admittedly limpetian John Millman on Friday. Trying to ruin his week is the in-form Marton Fucsovics \u2013 to get here, he\u2019s beaten Denis Shapovalov, the number 13 seed, and Jannik Sinner, who no less a luminary than JP McEnroe think will be a superstar. </p> <p>Play: 7pm local time, 8am GMT</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-26T07:27:20.365Z\">at 7.27am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s hard to see either of tonight\u2019s big winners, Federer or Barty, bringing it home. But it\u2019d be hard to complain if either did, and both will be better for this latest runaround. Anyhow, that\u2019s us \u2013 we\u2019ll see youse again tomorrow. Enjoy the rest of the weekend. Federer tells McEnroe that it was a tough start and \u201cMarton played clean\u201d. It took him a while to shake off the Millman match and the beatdown from the baseline\u201d, especially as it was cold, but he figured it out and things got a bit easier thereafter. McEnroe then makes him say something about Australia Day, so he thanks the fans and says he hopes to see them again next Australia Day before shouting out to Rod Laver. He says he\u2019s a big historian, how much he loves McEnroe \u2013 my days he\u2019s good at this \u2013 then McEnroe forces his to chortle chortle chortle that Tenys Sandgren is called ... wait for it ... TENYS! It\u2019s well, well funny I can tell you. And on that high, day seven is in the books. It\u2019s Sandgren next for Federer, which could be an interesting match. He reminds me a bit of Baghdatis, in that when he\u2019s hot he can be steaming \u2013 decent serve, lots of shots and creativity \u2013 but no chance he can sustain it for long enough to beat someone this good. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 2-6 2-6 Federer At 30-15, Federer swipes a backhand wide, but a serve out wide then a pick-up half-volley by his ankles sets up a match point. Fucsovics saves it though, when Federer contacts a net-cord that hasn\u2019t received the memo. The reprieve does not last long, a glorious pick-up drop by the net raising another match point ... again lost, when a forehand goes long. But that\u2019s enough of that, and at the third time of asking, Federer administers the final blows. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 2-6 2-5 Federer Federer has an eye, unilaterally halting a rally on break point because he saw a ball drop long. Hawkeye has a look, and confirms that he\u2019s right, which means he\u2019ll serve for the match in a few moments\u2019 time. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 2-6 2-4 Federer Federer holds to 15. He\u2019s played himself into some kind of form over the last two and a bit sets. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 2-6 2-3 Federer Federer holds easily and ramps up the heat thereafter, getting to 15-40 with a jumping backhand volley. Fucsovics, though, is game, saving both break point and holding from there. With this one nearly over, let\u2019s look ahead to what could be a highlight of the fortnight: Nadal-Kyrgios tomorrow. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 2-6 1-2 Federer Fucsovics finds some first serves, which sounds like a kids\u2019 reading book but is in fact what has just happened. He\u2019s on the board in set four. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 2-6 0-2 Federer Federer\u2019s forehand is looking good today - I didn\u2019t see his match will Millman, but I heard it didn\u2019t hold up well. Well, the boy is back in town and earns 40-15, after which an ace wraps up the game. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 2-6 0-1 Federer Federer gets to 30-40 and varies his pace and angle so well, setting Fucsovics up with the backhand slice before forcing the error with the drive forehand. He breaks immediately and looks extremely fresh for a 124 year-old man who played a five-setter two days ago. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 2-6 Federer Fucsovics, spooked, plays a ball that looks like it\u2019s going out and hits a backhand slice volley that gives him 15-30. And though Federer pegs him back, it\u2019s quickly 30-40, but a forehand then dips long and within seconds the set is sealed with a glorious backhand volley. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 2-5 Federer You can guess what happens next: Federer cranks up the pressure and at 15-30 incites Fucsovics to botch a backhand down the line. Then, he sends Federer to the backhand corner, Federer flicks back a speculative get cross-court and, as he comes in, Fucsovics allows it over his shoulder because it\u2019s going out ... except it isn\u2019t! It\u2019s borderline spooky how that stuff goes for Federer, how the cosmos conspires with the gods to subvert the laws of physics, right in front of our eyes. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 2-4 Federer Federer takes things just a little too easy, handing Fucsovics his first game in quite some time by airily attempting everything. Then, at 15-0 on Federer\u2019s serve, Fucsovics nails his favourite shot, the lob, and all of a sudden has two break points. Federer saves the first with a serve out wide backed up with a forehand down the line \u2013 stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before \u2013 but then nets a backhand! That\u2019s what happens when you take your eye off the ball, Roger, who absolutely needs bon mots from me. Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell on Barty\u2019s finagle. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 0-4 Federer Well. Federer drops and Fucsovics swings more freely, earning two break points only to swipe a backhand wide. Federer saves the next one too, but my picture breaks up so I don\u2019t know how; let\u2019s use our imaginations. Federer swiftly cleans up, a luscious drop brilliantly returned by a brilliant get, but what a response from Hoger, a forehand flipped cross-court from right in the forehand corner. He is quite good. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 0-3 Federer \u201cWhen it goes it goes quickly,\u201d as Alex Ferguson once said, and Federer soon has 15-40. He then sends a forehand long, but what a backhand, cross-court and right onto the tootsies. Fucsovics does well to get it back, except Federer simply glides in and lifts a winner past him for the double break. He is not long for this tournament. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 0-2 Federer Federer is relaxing, and not even in a good way \u2013 he knows his opponent can\u2019t hurt him, so just playing within himself. He holds easily; since winning the first set, Fucsovics has lost eight games of nine played. \u201cDare I ask the most overasked question in men\u2019s tennis,\u201d tweets Patrick. \u201cIf Rafa equals Rog on 20, does his superior head to head mark him out as the GOAT, or does there need to be a French Open-related asterisk next to his record? It depends how you judge. It\u2019s not solely a numbers game, and I think I\u2019d prefer to consider how good a player was at their best. If both turned up, I\u2019d still back Federer on every surface but clay, and I\u2019d have Djokovic in the conversation too. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 0-1 Federer At 0-30, Fucsovics finds a crucial colossal first serve, but then Federer cracks a forehand wide and to the ankles that\u2019s far too good. He then nets a backhand for no good reason, but it doesn\u2019t matter; a forehand sits up for Fucsovics, and he panics, lost in the supermarket, waving a drop shot from the baseline into the net. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll look (any more of) a moron if I say that this is over. Fucsovics 6-4 1-6 Federer A swift end to a swift set. I daresay we might see more of the same. Fucsovics 6-4 1-5 Federer A screeching backhand return down the line gives Federer 15-all, and a wrong-footing topspin forehand gives him a sniff. From there, it\u2019s quickly 30-40, and when a net-cord sits up, Federer punishes a forehand for the double break. Fucsovics\u2019 serve isn\u2019t doing the work it was in set 1, and what we\u2019re seeing is the difference between a player and a player. Loads on the tour can find a decent set against anyone, because they all have high top levels. But the serious payers have high bottom levels, and now Fucsovics has dropped, he\u2019s not good enough to make an impression. Fucsovics 6-4 1-4 Federer A love hold for Fucsovics gets him ready for Federer\u2019s next service game, and at 30-all, a lackadaisical backhand presents a break point. But Federer plays it well enough, pressurising Fucsovics to play a defensive shot that\u2019s neither lob nor pass. He quickly closes out from there, in a style you\u2019d take. Fucsovics 6-4 0-3 Federer Federer consolidates to 30. He\u2019s not flowing yet, but he\u2019s doing more, unfurling that forehand with greater authority as Fucsovics\u2019 level drops a touch. Fucsovics 6-4 0-2 Federer That set was the first Fucsovics has won against Federer. He\u2019s hitting the ball harder, which is key, but at 0-15 dumps a forehand into the net and at 15-30 Federer hooks a forehand wide, then cleans up with a leaping brute down the line. This gives him his first two break points of the match, and though Fucsovics saves the first, he then goes long with a forehand. Time\u2019s up. Though Federer is on the way down, it\u2019d be absolutely monumental if Fucsovics could actually do this. He\u2019s never been further than round 4 in any major \u2013 he\u2019s done it in Australia, twice \u2013 and is currently ranked 67 in the world. He\u2019s also 27 years old, which is to say that he\u2019s not about to become a contender given a fair wind. Fucsovics 6-4 Federer Fucsovics looks both cool and focused; he thinks he can do this, and why not? Well, because, but his first ace at 30-0 gives him three set points, the first of which disappears when a forehand drops long. But then a second serve out wide is too good, Federer sending a return cross-court on the stretch with sails wide! Fucsovics 5-4 Federer Federer sends a forehand long to give Fucsovics 30-all, but the serve and forehand take over. Fucsovics will have to serve for it. Fucsovics 5-3 Federer Fucsovics chucks the ball into the air before attempting consolidation, checking out the wind. It works well \u2013 he eased through a love game, his serve and forehand combining well. Federer has yet to find himself at this competition. Fucsovics 4-3 Federer Have a look! Fucsovics suddenly raises three break points, Federer saving the first with a forehand down the line. A fine return onto the baseline then gets Fucsovics right into the next rally, but again, Federer\u2019s forehand is too good and a backhand volley makes it 40-30. But Fucsovics isn\u2019t letting go, and a forehand, deep, forces Federer to go long! Fucsovics breaks, and needs just two holds to rack up this first set! Fucsovics 3-3 Federer Again, Federer gets to 30 on the Fucsovics serve, but again Fucsovics prevents him from making an impression beyond that. I\u2019d love for someone to explain to me how you go about supporting a person in an individual sport. Fucsovics 2-2 Federer Federer moves Fucsovics around with that sinister backhand slice, and it gets him to 30-all. But yerman responds well, sealing the game with a wrong-footing forehand that almost takes Federer off his feet. Fucsovics 1-2 Federer These two have only played twice before; you can probably guess what happened. Both have started well enough here, with nothing of note going down. So, while we wait a question we\u2019ve all asked numerous times: have we seen the last of Federer as a winner of majors? I\u2019ve said yes to that more than once, but I think we might finally be there now. Fucsovics 0-1 Federer Federer holds to 15. It\u2019s hard to see a way for Fucsovics here, but he\u2019ll have to serve like God to have a chance. Right, we\u2019re about ready to go. Federer will serve. They\u2019re knocking up. Federer is in mauve shorts and headband, looking like a bar of chocolate. Right, Federer-Fucsovics on the way. It\u2019s not such a bad old life. On the plus side for her, she played wack and won, in difficult conditions. It was strange to see Barty so tentative, especially on her forehand. She\u2019s not a great retriever nor hitter of winners, so can\u2019t just wait for errors, not offer up chances. She tells Alex Corretja that she needs to trust herself and enjoy herself \u2013 that sounds like a platitude, but is actually extremely good advice. Barty tells Jim Courier that she had to hang in there, and it was tough. The wind is tough when you serve from one end, she says, and looking forward says that she loves Petra, \u201cbut hopefully she doesn\u2019t break my heart\u201d. Barty is the newly elected young Australian of the year and when Courier congratulates her, says she\u2019s just trying to be the best version of her\u201d. She really is extremely likeable, and it\u2019s extremely affirming to see her do well. But she\u2019ll need to play a lot better to get by Kvitova, unless Kvitova has a mare. Riske goes long with her first serve ... and again! Oh that\u2019s a shame \u2013 Riske has played really well and fought really hard, but Barty found just enough big shots at just about the right times to get it done! Kvitova next for her, who beat her in the quarters last term. A mass-murderous forehand from Barty takes her to 30-all on the Riske serve at 5-4, and suddenly, out of nowhere, one more forehand and it\u2019s match point Barty! That final point I was on about: here it is. Elsewhere, South Africa are fighting back against England in the fourth and final Test. You should follow that here: Reminder: when this is done, we\u2019ve got Federer-Fucsovics for your delectation. Barty plays a tame backhand slice into the net and Riske jumps on her, seizing the opportunity and breaking back! She returns to her seat with a shriek and a leap, and knows that she\u2019s right in this. Barty needs to stop being so tentative and start hitting the ball - she\u2019s the better player, but not if she doesn\u2019t impose her superiority. In the meantime, Riske holds to 15 for three games in a row. Barty 6-3 1-6 4-4 Riske. We\u2019re getting to it on Melbourne, deuce on the Fognini serve at 4-5. And a drop-shot forces Fognini to the net; Sandgren joins him there to put away the volley and raise match point! AND THERE IT IS! A forehand into the corner, then a lush touch-volley, on one knee below the level of the net, and what a point that is, how it encapsulates a brilliant match! Sandgren is through and plays Federer or Fucsovics nex! But, in the meantime, Barty consolidates and Riske barrels through a love game. It\u2019s 4-2 Barty in the third. When you watch Barty play like this, it\u2019s hard to see her winning here. Her best isn\u2019t the best, and at some point she\u2019s likely to run into someone, whether it\u2019s Kvitova, Halep or Muguruza, to impose it upon her. On the plus side for her, the second two are in the bottom half, so she\u2019ll only have to play one of them, but both are looking serious. A forehand that at once booms and loops gives Barty 0-30, her first sniff in a while. But it looks bad for her when Riske deploys the net-cord next point - she could run it down, but turns away too early to notice. Still, that forehand is being hit with far greater conviction now, and another loopy boomer down the line gives her two break points ... AND SHE ONLY NEEDS ONE! She comes in off a backhand, then two crisp volleys put her three holds away! Barty 6-3 1-6 3-1 Riske. Better from Barty, who sails through a hold and finds her first ace in tiiiiime. On Melbourne, meanwhile, Sandgren and Fognini are still on serve in set four. Riske responds with a love game. It\u2019s 1-1 in the decider, and the underdog is looking good. Barty is really struggling here, popping up balls for Riske. She\u2019s not hitting it well, so is playing without confidence and conviction; Riske knows that the ball will be there for her, and even though Barty holds to 30, she looked horrible doing it. A big forehand for Barty gives her a sniff at 30-all, but Riske hammers down an ace and another big serve sees a backhand return go long! We\u2019ve got ourselves a decider, and the number 1 seed \u2013 who, let us remember, has never beaten Riske, and lost to her at Wimbledon - needs to find something. That was an extremely one-sided set. Barty 6-3 1-6 Riske. On Melbourne, Sandgren and Fognini are on serve in the fourth set, but Fognini is pushing hard to level the match at 2-2. Really! Riske\u2019s forehand is dominating this set, and she\u2019s about to serve for it! She breaks again, and Barty, who\u2019s cold at the moment, has a lot of work to do. Barty 6-3 1-5 Riske. Great work from Riske to hold from 0-30 down. She finds first serves when she needs them, which allows her to dictate with the forehand. She only needs two more to take us into a decider. Barty hauls herself into the set with a comfortable hold. She\u2019s a funny one, really \u2013 not someone we necessarily foresaw winning a major or becoming the best player in the world, but here she is. Perhaps it\u2019s because there\u2019s something of an extended power-vacuum in the women\u2019s game at present \u2013 it\u2019s been a whole since we had the kind of dominant champion who forces up standards. But the game itself is so exciting, because no one has a scooby what\u2019s going to happen. Barty 6-3 1-3 Riske. Sandgren takes a second injury time-out. MO-mentum might just\u2019ve shifted. A gorgeous inside-out backhand encapsulates exactly how it\u2019s going for Riske at the moment, as she consolidates to love. Barty 6-3 0-3 Riske. Fognini is loving life, moving Sandgren about to open the court, sticking a a forehand into the space, and at 6-2 he has four set points! He only needs one! Fognini has already fought back from two sets down this tournament; can he do it again? Sandgren 7-6(5) 7-5 (2)6-7 Fognini. It\u2019s all going on! A loose service-game from Barty ends when she slices a backhand long, giving Riske the break to 30! I\u2019d not be surprised to see Barty snatch it straight back, but Riske has 8/10 points so far this set. Barty 6-3 0-2 Riske. Excellent from Fognini, who takes the first mini-break by dictating from the baseline via monstrous forehand. He leads 3-1. Huge love hold \u2013 or love-hold, it\u2019s extremely hard to say \u2013 for Riske at the start of set two. Barty will have to take it from her. Sandgren hangs in there under all sorts of pressure as Fognini turns it up at 5-6. He secures a second breaker of the match with an ace down the middle, and if he wins that he\u2019s through to round 5. Sandgren 7-6 7-5 6-6 Fognini. At 40-15, Barty misses another forehand down the line, but serve down the T is too good and caps a fine, intense set from the world number 1. Riske needs to find something. Riske battles through a hold, meaning Barty will serve for the first set at 5-3. Wanted: a subeditor. Barty is back, one beautifully-constructed point, finished with a backhand down the line, eventually setting up the ace which secures the game to 15. Barty 5-2 Riske. Well that lasted. This time, Barty piles into and through a forehand down the line and it gives her her break back; at 4-2, she may well have broken the back of the first set. Back on Melbourne, Sandgren is angry about something I missed; Fognini laughs at him. You hate to see it*. Sandgren 7-6 7-5 4-4 Fognini. *You do not hate to see it. Oh yes! Look at Alison Riske! Not long ago, Barty ought to have put away a forehand for 4-0 and a double break, and now she\u2019s lost her actual break! Riske is proper settled now, her forehand in full working order. Barty 3-2 Riske. Gwan Ons! Riske is in huge trouble here, the anxiety is smeared all the way across her coupon when she can\u2019t retrieve a forehand right into her backhand corner. But at 30-40, a reprieve: Barty, having opened the court, nets a straightforward forehand down the line. Riske is tough though, and saves a further break point with an ace down the middle before securing the game with two more big serves. Barty 3-1 Riske. Back on the Melbourne Arena, Fognini isn\u2019t going anywhere. It\u2019s 2-2 in set three, but Sandgren leads by two sets to love. Oh yes, Barty is moving beautifully. She opens up the court, sending Riske to hither and yon, then consolidates the break with a monstrous forehand. Barty 3-0 Riske. Excellent from Barty on 15-40, her running and chasing setting up a low forehand, whipped cross-court. It\u2019s not a winner, but it sets the tone for the point, and she\u2019s soon 2-0 up in set 1. Barty is in touch here. Barty, serving in game 1, is hauled back from 40-0 to 40-30, but moves ahead, A wild forehand from Fognini puts Sandgren up a break in set three. He takes an injury timeout which involves having his leg yanked in all sorts of painful directions, but he\u2019s nearly there now. Barty (1) and Riske (18) are with us, and getting warm. Barty has never beaten Riske. Barty and Riske will be with us shortly. Fognini needed a final-set breaker to bin Reilly Opelka in round 1, but it\u2019s a longass-ass way back for him from here, as they say round Sandgren\u2019s way. Hello! A brilliant backhand pass gives Sandgren a break! As I said, he\u2019d be as well to tank Fognini\u2019s service games, and he\u2019ll now serve for the second set. This is a really good match now; Fognini is steaming hot. If I were Sandgren, I\u2019d think about taking his service games off now, to recuperate for a breaker. Five games on the spin for Fognini, who leads 5-4 in the second; Sandgren by one set to love. Fognini is leaning into Sandgren now, first holding, and now with a break point; Sandgren looks tired. I\u2019m not surprised, given his politics, all that must take its toll on a person. He finds one huge forehand, but Fognini wears it and a walloped inside-out backhand allows him to DIC-tate the rally before clinching the second break-back! We\u2019re back on serve in the second! Back on court, Fognini has somehow outlasted Sandgren in a monumental 26-shot rally, to snatch a break back. He now trails 2-4 in the second set; might that be the start of the long, torturous route back into this match? So Kenin told Gauff \u201cNot today\u201d, but she and the rest of the tour remain on notice. A tennis coach mate of mine was asked to put together a video detailing and analysing her weaknesses ... and couldn\u2019t find any. Given the capricious nature of the women\u2019s game, we can be sure that it\u2019ll be soon. Earlier today: in the men\u2019s competition, has the penny finally dropped for the Canadian Cyborg? Milos Raonic (32) whacked Marin Cilic 4,3, and 5, just as he whacked Stefanos Tistsipas 5,4 and 6 in the previous round. He meets Novak Djokovic (2) next, who perfunctorily crushed Diego Schwartzman (14) 3,4, and 4. In the women\u2019s competition, Coco Gauff is gone. She won the first set on a breaker, but then Sofia Kenin (14) switched on the power, taking the next two 3 and 0. She\u2019ll play Ons Jabeur next; the Tunisian got rid of Quiang Wang (27) and the blog\u2019s accumulator 7-6 6-1. Elsewhere, Petra Kvitova (7), great friend of the long-time favourite of the blog, did for Maria Sakkari (22), 7-6(4) 6-3 6-2. She\u2019ll play Barty or Riske next. Left over from the afternoon session: Tenys Sandgren leads Fabio Fognini (12) 7-6, 2-0. Fognini has just taken an injury timeout for a blister on a finger, while Sangren has won the last 10 points, Greetings all, and welcome to the evening session \u2013 and maybe what\u2019s left of the day session \u2013 of this seventh go-around of the 2020 Australian Open. What we have for sure is the world number 1, Ashleigh Barty, playing in her home Grand Slam \u2013 she meets the late-blooming Alison Riske who, at the ancient age of 28 (or was she 29?) has just enjoyed the best year of her career. Included in that year was a run to the Wimbledon quarterfinals, included in that run a win over Barty. That one will be decent. Then, when that\u2019s done, we get to enjoy Roger Federer, and who knows for how much longer that\u2019ll be so. He\u2019s not looked especially good so far and needed a super-duper tie-break to shake off the admittedly limpetian John Millman on Friday. Trying to ruin his week is the in-form Marton Fucsovics \u2013 to get here, he\u2019s beaten Denis Shapovalov, the number 13 seed, and Jannik Sinner, who no less a luminary than JP McEnroe think will be a superstar.

Stay focused on the big picture.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/25/joe-rogan-bernie-sanders-endorsement-democrats\">Why the Joe Rogan endorsement is a good thing for Bernie Sanders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here is what you need to know.</p> <h2>1. Did Trump commit an impeachable offense?</h2> <p>Yes. His attempt to get a foreign power to help him win the 2020 election is precisely the sort of thing the framers of the constitution worried about when they created the impeachment clause. If presidents could seek foreign help winning elections, there would be no end of foreign intrusions into American sovereignty and democracy.</p> <h2>2. Will the Senate convict and remove him from office?</h2> <p>No. The impeachment clause requires that two-thirds of the Senate vote to convict. That means that even if every one of the 45 Democratic and two independent senators votes to oust Trump, 20 Republicans would need to join them for Trump to be removed. The odds that 20 Republican senators will do so are exactly zero.</p> <h2>3<em>. </em>Why won\u2019t they?</h2> <p>There are not 20 Republican senators with the courage and integrity to protect the constitution and the nation from the most dangerous and demagogic president in history. Led by Mitch McConnell, they are engaged in a concerted cover-up of some of the most outrageous conduct ever committed by high-level government officials. Even so-called moderates like Susan Collins and Mitt Romney cannot be relied on to grow a spine and conduct a fair trial.</p> <h2>4. Why are they so spineless?</h2> <p>Because they want to keep their jobs, and they know that 90% of Republican voters approve of Trump. They fear Trump\u2019s sway over their voting base and his massive fundraising apparatus.</p> <h2>5. Why do 90% of Republican voters support him?</h2> <p>Because he has convinced them he\u2019s on their side and that he\u2019s the victim of a plot orchestrated by the establishment and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/03/trump-steve-bannon-deep-state-conspiracy-theory\">deep state</a>\u201d bureaucrats.</p> <h2>6. How has Trump retained their support?</h2> <p>By lying constantly, casting the mainstream press as biased and untrustworthy, relying on his propaganda machine (Fox News and rightwing radio) to trumpet his lies, using Twitter and Facebook to deliver those lies directly to his followers, and fomenting the \u201cculture war\u201d \u2013 wielding deep divisions over race, guns, religion, abortion and immigrants \u2013 to fuel his base.</p> <h2>7. Where\u2019s the money coming from?</h2> <p>Billionaires, chief executives, corporate executives and the denizens of Wall Street continue to fund the Republican party and bankroll Trump and his propaganda machine. They\u2019re doing this because they\u2019re raking in billions thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/30/trump-tax-cut-law-investigation-worker-benefits\">the Trump-Republican tax cuts</a> and regulatory rollbacks.

      "bodyText": "Don\u2019t get bogged down in the minutiae of Donald Trump\u2019s Senate impeachment trial \u2013 the procedural maneuvers aimed at getting witness testimony and new documents that Republicans want to prevent at all costs. Stay focused on the big picture. Here is what you need to know. 1. Did Trump commit an impeachable offense? Yes. His attempt to get a foreign power to help him win the 2020 election is precisely the sort of thing the framers of the constitution worried about when they created the impeachment clause. If presidents could seek foreign help winning elections, there would be no end of foreign intrusions into American sovereignty and democracy. 2. Will the Senate convict and remove him from office? No. The impeachment clause requires that two-thirds of the Senate vote to convict. That means that even if every one of the 45 Democratic and two independent senators votes to oust Trump, 20 Republicans would need to join them for Trump to be removed. The odds that 20 Republican senators will do so are exactly zero. 3. Why won\u2019t they? There are not 20 Republican senators with the courage and integrity to protect the constitution and the nation from the most dangerous and demagogic president in history. Led by Mitch McConnell, they are engaged in a concerted cover-up of some of the most outrageous conduct ever committed by high-level government officials. Even so-called moderates like Susan Collins and Mitt Romney cannot be relied on to grow a spine and conduct a fair trial. 4. Why are they so spineless? Because they want to keep their jobs, and they know that 90% of Republican voters approve of Trump. They fear Trump\u2019s sway over their voting base and his massive fundraising apparatus. 5. Why do 90% of Republican voters support him? Because he has convinced them he\u2019s on their side and that he\u2019s the victim of a plot orchestrated by the establishment and \u201cdeep state\u201d bureaucrats. 6. How has Trump retained their support? By lying constantly, casting the mainstream press as biased and untrustworthy, relying on his propaganda machine (Fox News and rightwing radio) to trumpet his lies, using Twitter and Facebook to deliver those lies directly to his followers, and fomenting the \u201cculture war\u201d \u2013 wielding deep divisions over race, guns, religion, abortion and immigrants \u2013 to fuel his base. 7. Where\u2019s the money coming from? Billionaires, chief executives, corporate executives and the denizens of Wall Street continue to fund the Republican party and bankroll Trump and his propaganda machine. They\u2019re doing this because they\u2019re raking in billions thanks to the Trump-Republican tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks. Trump is already promising more if he gets a second term. \u201cThe attitude of the business community toward the Trump administration appears quite positive,\u201d says Stephen Schwarzman, who runs Blackstone, the world\u2019s largest investment fund. 8. Will the Senate trial change public opinion about Trump? No. Trump\u2019s overall job ratings haven\u2019t budged. In the most recent polls, 40% of Americans (including that 90% of Republican voters) approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president, while 58% say they disapprove. These percentages are exactly the same as they were in September, before the House launched its formal impeachment inquiry and voted to impeach the president. 9. What does all this mean for the 2020 election? Trump will claim that his forthcoming acquittal by the Senate clears him of all charges, just as he claimed attorney general William Barr\u2019s whitewash of the Mueller report absolved him of charges that he sought Russian help in 2016. He\u2019ll use both as \u201cproof\u201d that Democrats fabricated a plot to remove him from office. But none of this is likely to sway the majority of Americans who don\u2019t want Trump re-elected.

      "body": "<p>It seems we can\u2019t move for comments about race dominating our media landscape, be it about an actor formerly known as a princess, or by an actor previously unknown to anyone outside of his famous acting dynasty. These are fractious times, and such debates appear to be increasing in frequency. But there are some fights for which you can arm yourself in advance \u2013 and when the argument is about race, the weapon of choice is science.</p> <p>Racism is a prejudice that has a longstanding relationship with science. The invention of race occurred in the age of empires and plunder, when men of the emerging discipline of science classified the people of the world, mostly from their armchairs. Carl Linnaeus is the father of biological taxonomy, having invented the system that we use today: genus and species \u2013 <em>Homo sapiens</em>. He was also a central figure in the emergence of scientific racism too, alongside Kant, Voltaire and a host of other European men.</p> <p>Classifications were based primarily on skin colour, some on a handful of skull measurements, and they also came with some shoddy value judgments: Linnaeus had the people of Africa as lazy and \u201cgoverned by caprice\u201d; Native Americans were \u201czealous and stubborn\u201d; East Asians were haughty, greedy, and \u201cruled by opinions\u201d. Voltaire believed that black people were a different species. All of these taxonomies were inherently hierarchical, with white Europeans always on top.</p> <p>In the 19th century, Darwin\u2019s half-cousin Francis Galton and others tightened their scientific arguments for race though, as Darwin noted, no one could agree on how many races there actually were, the range being between one and 63. Galton was an amazing scientist, and a stunning racist. The most delicious irony about him is that the field he effectively established \u2013 human genetics \u2013 is the branch of science that has demonstrated unequivocally that race is not biologically meaningful. Modern genetics clearly shows that the way we colloquially define race does not align with the biology that underpins human variation. Instead, race is a cultural taxonomy \u2013 a social construct. This doesn\u2019t mean it is invalid or unimportant, nor does it mean that race does not exist. Humans are social animals, and the way we perceive each other is of paramount importance. Race exists because we perceive it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No country, people, political power or border is permanent. The only true indigenous Brits were not even our own species</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Racism seems to be making a comeback in public life: the prime minister has a well-stocked back catalogue of racist remarks, most notably describing Congolese people as \u201cpiccanninies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. Antisemitism is a defining issue for the 21st-century Labour party. Sport has always suffered from racist fans, and in 2018, bananas were thrown on to pitches at black footballers such as Arsenal\u2019s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, as they were routinely 30 years ago. The England cricketer Jofra Archer was subjected to racist abuse in a Test match in New Zealand in November.</p> <p>We all know someone who has casually racist opinions: the misattribution of elite athletic success to ancestry rather than training, that east Asian students are naturally better at maths; or that Jews are innately good with money. Racism may be back, so get tooled up, because science is no ally to racists. Here are some standard canards of prejudice, and why science says something different.</p> <h2><strong>Skin in the game</strong> </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15bd88f9b23f78eab89c78060140659dd18e697d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15bd88f9b23f78eab89c78060140659dd18e697d/20_590_984_590/500.jpg\" alt=\"From 2015, updates to emojis have offered a variety of skin tones.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From 2015, updates to emojis have offered a variety of skin tones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What we see with our eyes is the merest fraction of a person. But humans are a highly visual species, and skin colour is the primary factor in allocating race. This idea is modern though, only becoming the primary classifier during the so-called Age of Enlightenment. Modern genetics reveals a much more complicated \u2013 and fascinating \u2013 picture.</p> <p>Lighter skin is, at least partially, an adaptation to less sunny skies, as a means of protecting us from folate deficiency. <em>Homo sapiens</em> originated as an African species, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we were ancestrally dark-skinned, nor that everyone was the same colour. Some of the differences we can see and measure between populations are local adaptations to evolutionary pressures such as food availability and disease. Similarly, genes for lighter pigmentation have been selected by an evolution away from the equator. But the palette of skin colour within the African continent is far greater than anywhere else, meaning that a simplistic model of selection based on exposure to the sun only explains a fraction of that diversity. There are 1.3 billion Africans, 42 million African Americans. Not only are these huge numbers, but the people in question are more diverse genetically than anyone else on Earth. And yet westerners refer to all of them as \u201cblack\u201d. This is a scientifically meaningless classification, and one that is baked into western culture from five centuries of scientific racism. Stereotyping based on pigmentation is foolish, because racial differences are skin deep.</p> <h2><strong>These lands are your lands</strong> </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ccfe871513cba08322770d9a128f79bfe448c37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ccfe871513cba08322770d9a128f79bfe448c37/0_355_5854_3513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Left to right: Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, who were told by Donald Trump to \u2018go back home\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEngland for the English\u201d warbled Morrissey in his song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1cTiqXWKII\" title=\"\">The National Front Disco</a>. Now that Mozza has given apparent support to <a href=\"https://www.forbritain.uk/\" title=\"\">For Britain</a>, a political party even Nigel Farage thinks is full of \u201cNazis and racists\u201d, it\u2019s no longer clear the lyrics were ironic. Although Morrissey denies he is a racist, the sentiment is an old racist refrain. In July last year, President Trump suggested that if four elected US congresswomen didn\u2019t like it in the US, they should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/14/trump-squad-tlaib-omar-pressley-ocasio-cortez\" title=\"\">go back to where they came from</a>. Three of them were born in the United States and one is a Somali-born American citizen. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s paternal grandparents were German immigrants, his mother Scottish-born, his first wife Moravian, his third, Slovenian. It is never clear where the benchmark for indigeneity lies.</p> <p>Indigeneity is a tricky concept. The British Isles have been invaded throughout their history: 1066 was the most recent hostile conquest, but before that, we were occupied by Vikings, who followed Angles, Saxons, Alans, and dozens of other tribes. The Romans ruled for a while, with conscripts not from Rome but from all over their empire, including Gaul, the Mediterranean and sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>About 4,500 years ago, Britain was populated primarily with farmers who had European ancestors. DNA taken from the bones of the long dead suggests they were probably olive-skinned, with dark hair and brown eyes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Family trees are\u00a0matted webs, and all\u00a0the lines of our ancestry get tangled after a few\u00a0generations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Beaker folk arrived in Britain about 4,400 years ago, and again according to ancient DNA, within a few centuries had replaced almost the entire population. We don\u2019t know how or why, whether it was violence, disease, or something else.</p> <p>Before them there were darker-skinned hunter-gatherers, who had been there a few thousand years. Then it all gets a bit foggy. The earliest evidence of British humans is in the crumbling coastline of Happisburgh in Norfolk, where size nine footprints of an unknown species of human were set in soft stone 900,000 years ago.</p> <p>No country, people, political power or border is permanent. The only true indigenous Brits were not even our own species. So, when racists say \u201cEngland for the English\u201d, or when they talk about indigenous people, I do not know who they mean, or more specifically, when they mean. They probably don\u2019t either.</p> <h2><strong>Pure blood</strong> </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58f4398610c1416a915c0c2a89009b932c96fedb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58f4398610c1416a915c0c2a89009b932c96fedb/63_383_3401_2040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Francis Galton\u2019s anthropometric laboratory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Francis Galton\u2019s anthropometric laboratory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Science &amp; Society Picture Library/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>White supremacists are obsessed with DNA. I spend time lurking in some of the nastiest corners of the internet, partially so that you don\u2019t have to, but also to track their conversations about ancestry. Racist online cesspits such as Stormfront and 4Chan and 8Kun are flooded with thousands of posts about racial purity and ancestry-testing products. Occasionally, these commercial kits reveal previously unknown ancestry from people that white supremacists loathe. White purity is the key idea within white supremacy, and reactions are often conspiracy-fuelled (\u201cthe companies are owned by Jews\u201d), or just absurd: \u201cWhen you look in the mirror, do you see a jew [sic]? If not, you\u2019re good,\u201d which somewhat undermines the point of the tests.</p> <p>There are no purebred humans. Our family trees are matted webs, and all lines of our ancestry get tangled after a few generations. All Nazis have Jewish forebears, all racists have African ancestors. Non-racists often think that their ancestry is somehow pure too, and this can be bolstered by misinterpreting commercial genetic ancestry kits.

      "bodyText": "It seems we can\u2019t move for comments about race dominating our media landscape, be it about an actor formerly known as a princess, or by an actor previously unknown to anyone outside of his famous acting dynasty. These are fractious times, and such debates appear to be increasing in frequency. But there are some fights for which you can arm yourself in advance \u2013 and when the argument is about race, the weapon of choice is science. Racism is a prejudice that has a longstanding relationship with science. The invention of race occurred in the age of empires and plunder, when men of the emerging discipline of science classified the people of the world, mostly from their armchairs. Carl Linnaeus is the father of biological taxonomy, having invented the system that we use today: genus and species \u2013 Homo sapiens. He was also a central figure in the emergence of scientific racism too, alongside Kant, Voltaire and a host of other European men. Classifications were based primarily on skin colour, some on a handful of skull measurements, and they also came with some shoddy value judgments: Linnaeus had the people of Africa as lazy and \u201cgoverned by caprice\u201d; Native Americans were \u201czealous and stubborn\u201d; East Asians were haughty, greedy, and \u201cruled by opinions\u201d. Voltaire believed that black people were a different species. All of these taxonomies were inherently hierarchical, with white Europeans always on top. In the 19th century, Darwin\u2019s half-cousin Francis Galton and others tightened their scientific arguments for race though, as Darwin noted, no one could agree on how many races there actually were, the range being between one and 63. Galton was an amazing scientist, and a stunning racist. The most delicious irony about him is that the field he effectively established \u2013 human genetics \u2013 is the branch of science that has demonstrated unequivocally that race is not biologically meaningful. Modern genetics clearly shows that the way we colloquially define race does not align with the biology that underpins human variation. Instead, race is a cultural taxonomy \u2013 a social construct. This doesn\u2019t mean it is invalid or unimportant, nor does it mean that race does not exist. Humans are social animals, and the way we perceive each other is of paramount importance. Race exists because we perceive it. Racism seems to be making a comeback in public life: the prime minister has a well-stocked back catalogue of racist remarks, most notably describing Congolese people as \u201cpiccanninies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. Antisemitism is a defining issue for the 21st-century Labour party. Sport has always suffered from racist fans, and in 2018, bananas were thrown on to pitches at black footballers such as Arsenal\u2019s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, as they were routinely 30 years ago. The England cricketer Jofra Archer was subjected to racist abuse in a Test match in New Zealand in November. We all know someone who has casually racist opinions: the misattribution of elite athletic success to ancestry rather than training, that east Asian students are naturally better at maths; or that Jews are innately good with money. Racism may be back, so get tooled up, because science is no ally to racists. Here are some standard canards of prejudice, and why science says something different. Skin in the game What we see with our eyes is the merest fraction of a person. But humans are a highly visual species, and skin colour is the primary factor in allocating race. This idea is modern though, only becoming the primary classifier during the so-called Age of Enlightenment. Modern genetics reveals a much more complicated \u2013 and fascinating \u2013 picture. Lighter skin is, at least partially, an adaptation to less sunny skies, as a means of protecting us from folate deficiency. Homo sapiens originated as an African species, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we were ancestrally dark-skinned, nor that everyone was the same colour. Some of the differences we can see and measure between populations are local adaptations to evolutionary pressures such as food availability and disease. Similarly, genes for lighter pigmentation have been selected by an evolution away from the equator. But the palette of skin colour within the African continent is far greater than anywhere else, meaning that a simplistic model of selection based on exposure to the sun only explains a fraction of that diversity. There are 1.3 billion Africans, 42 million African Americans. Not only are these huge numbers, but the people in question are more diverse genetically than anyone else on Earth. And yet westerners refer to all of them as \u201cblack\u201d. This is a scientifically meaningless classification, and one that is baked into western culture from five centuries of scientific racism. Stereotyping based on pigmentation is foolish, because racial differences are skin deep. These lands are your lands \u201cEngland for the English\u201d warbled Morrissey in his song The National Front Disco. Now that Mozza has given apparent support to For Britain, a political party even Nigel Farage thinks is full of \u201cNazis and racists\u201d, it\u2019s no longer clear the lyrics were ironic. Although Morrissey denies he is a racist, the sentiment is an old racist refrain. In July last year, President Trump suggested that if four elected US congresswomen didn\u2019t like it in the US, they should go back to where they came from. Three of them were born in the United States and one is a Somali-born American citizen. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s paternal grandparents were German immigrants, his mother Scottish-born, his first wife Moravian, his third, Slovenian. It is never clear where the benchmark for indigeneity lies. Indigeneity is a tricky concept. The British Isles have been invaded throughout their history: 1066 was the most recent hostile conquest, but before that, we were occupied by Vikings, who followed Angles, Saxons, Alans, and dozens of other tribes. The Romans ruled for a while, with conscripts not from Rome but from all over their empire, including Gaul, the Mediterranean and sub-Saharan Africa. About 4,500 years ago, Britain was populated primarily with farmers who had European ancestors. DNA taken from the bones of the long dead suggests they were probably olive-skinned, with dark hair and brown eyes. The Beaker folk arrived in Britain about 4,400 years ago, and again according to ancient DNA, within a few centuries had replaced almost the entire population. We don\u2019t know how or why, whether it was violence, disease, or something else. Before them there were darker-skinned hunter-gatherers, who had been there a few thousand years. Then it all gets a bit foggy. The earliest evidence of British humans is in the crumbling coastline of Happisburgh in Norfolk, where size nine footprints of an unknown species of human were set in soft stone 900,000 years ago. No country, people, political power or border is permanent. The only true indigenous Brits were not even our own species. So, when racists say \u201cEngland for the English\u201d, or when they talk about indigenous people, I do not know who they mean, or more specifically, when they mean. They probably don\u2019t either. Pure blood White supremacists are obsessed with DNA. I spend time lurking in some of the nastiest corners of the internet, partially so that you don\u2019t have to, but also to track their conversations about ancestry. Racist online cesspits such as Stormfront and 4Chan and 8Kun are flooded with thousands of posts about racial purity and ancestry-testing products. Occasionally, these commercial kits reveal previously unknown ancestry from people that white supremacists loathe. White purity is the key idea within white supremacy, and reactions are often conspiracy-fuelled (\u201cthe companies are owned by Jews\u201d), or just absurd: \u201cWhen you look in the mirror, do you see a jew [sic]? If not, you\u2019re good,\u201d which somewhat undermines the point of the tests. There are no purebred humans. Our family trees are matted webs, and all lines of our ancestry get tangled after a few generations. All Nazis have Jewish forebears, all racists have African ancestors. Non-racists often think that their ancestry is somehow pure too, and this can be bolstered by misinterpreting commercial genetic ancestry kits. But no matter how isolated or wholesome you think your family tree is, it is a node on a tangled bank, linked directly to everyone else on your continent after only a few centuries, and everyone in the world after a couple of millennia. Genealogy and genetic genealogy are not perfectly aligned, and due to the way DNA is shuffled during the production of sperm and egg, much is cumulatively lost over the generations. What this means is that you carry DNA from only half of your ancestors 11 generations back. You are genetically unrelated to people from whom you are actually descended as recently as the middle of the 18th century. You are descended from multitudes, most of whom you know nothing about, and many of whom you have no meaningful genetic relationship with. Black power The last white man to win the 100m final at the Olympics was Allan Wells in 1980, a year when the US boycotted the event. This was also the last time white men competed in the final, five in total. For many, this forms the basis of a long-standing assumption that black people \u2013 and more specifically African Americans, Jamaicans or Canadians \u2013 have a biological advantage for explosive energy sports.

This is also a total nonstarter, for many reasons. Most significantly, we can look for the signals of evolutionary selection in African Americans since the beginning of transatlantic slavery, that is, genes that have proliferated in that population. A 2014 study of the DNA of 29,141 African Americans showed no signs of selection across the whole genome for any trait in the time since their ancestors were taken from their African homelands.

The plan fell apart, though, after Zender complained that the offer came with too little money and too many conditions about who in the neighborhood Zender was allowed to associate with. </p> <p>Plan B was to turn to the venerable Frank Romero \u2013 most famous for a mural he painted on the side of a <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/going-to-the-olympics-frank-romero/EgHf4GpU3x1jPg\">downtown freeway</a> for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics \u2013 who accepted the commission but passed most of the work off to an assistant, since he lived most of the year outside the United States.</p> <p>The new mural was attacked over and over, once with blue paint and the single word \u201cDisplacers\u201d (in imitation of the Dodgers baseball team\u2019s logo), and another time with crude white spray paint that read: \u201cFuck hipsters.\u201d The anti-gentrification activists were incensed, first because a local real estate agency was sponsoring the mural, which made Romero a sellout in their eyes, and second because Romero\u2019s assistant was white. Pretty soon the wall was back to all white, too.</p> <p>Next on the anti-gentrification taggers\u2019 list was a mural on the side of an upscale bar and deli called Tinfoil (since renamed Flask), where whisky connoisseurs can spend as much as $1,200 on a single bottle. The city itself vetoed Tinfoil\u2019s first idea, which was to turn the mural into an advertisement for Johnny Walker. Instead, the bar commissioned a local Latino artist, Sol Luongo, to produce a montage of Highland Park landmarks under the title Momentos Magicos Magic Moments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fdc3ecfc87d9da27dbd18293d388f346cf813c9b8%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2000&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F58accf85bd26e25abe44482bf6d8bf97f97a1945%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2000&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Left: Flask, an upscale bar and deli, is one of the many new businesses in Highland Park.

      "bodyText": "Kathy Gallegos remembers the first time she saw John \u201cZender\u201d Estrada\u2019s striking mural of an Aztec warrior flanked by two eagles. She was parking behind a music venue in Highland Park, a heavily Latino working-class neighborhood northeast of downtown Los Angeles, and couldn\u2019t help noticing the bold imagery of a piece that Zender had painted in the wake of the 1992 riots to urge ordinary Angelenos to \u201cresist violence with peace\u201d. \u201cI remember thinking, that\u2019s a really nice mural,\u201d Gallegos recalled. \u201cNext thing I knew, the place was bought and it was gone.\u201d It was the same pattern a couple of years later, when Gallegos \u2013 who owns a local gallery promoting Latino and Chicano art \u2013 stopped to admire a graffiti-strewn parking lot wall on the other side of Figueroa Boulevard, where for years young artists had been given free rein to practice and invent at will. She particularly liked a heart image reminiscent of a veteran LA muralist named Frank Romero and made a note to photograph it. \u201cNext thing I know,\u201d she said, \u201cthe whole wall was whitewashed.\u201d Urban murals are fragile artworks at the best of times, subject to the whims of taggers who may deface them, and of property owners who often want to paint over them or knock down the walls. But Gallegos and many others in Highland Park recognized that these new erasures were different: the result of dizzying change in one of the most rapidly gentrifying parts of LA and, it seemed, a failure by the newcomers to understand the culture of the neighborhood they were starting to call their own. Now, the consternation that Gallegos and others once felt has degenerated into a full-blown conflict, with the murals of Highland Park acting as a proxy battleground for a variety of other tensions \u2013 over property prices, the pace of gentrification, tenant evictions, the integrity of once-venerated local artists, and the ability of local city officials to act as honest brokers between the competing interest groups. Mural wars Old murals, even those protected under a 2013 citywide ordinance, continue to disappear without warning, triggering noisy protests. Commissioning new artwork, meanwhile, often proves perilous, as muralists endure personal taunts and threats as they paint and never know when their work will get spray-bombed with loud slogans telling the hipsters and gentrifiers to go back where they came from. The Highland Park mural war erupted in earnest in 2017, when two city-owned sites \u2013 including the wall with the Frank Romero-esque heart \u2013 were whitewashed, and a radical group calling itself Restorative Justice for the Arts started accusing local city officials of colluding with incoming property speculators to destroy the neighborhood. It did not help the city\u2019s cause that a trail of official emails soon became public and showed that council employees had deemed the long-standing graffiti walls to be \u201cillegal\u201d and given their blessing to a local business owners\u2019 association to wipe them clean. The city appeared to understand it had made a blunder and sought to make amends by asking Zender, the artist behind the destroyed Aztec warrior, to paint something new at the site of one of the erasures. The plan fell apart, though, after Zender complained that the offer came with too little money and too many conditions about who in the neighborhood Zender was allowed to associate with. Plan B was to turn to the venerable Frank Romero \u2013 most famous for a mural he painted on the side of a downtown freeway for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics \u2013 who accepted the commission but passed most of the work off to an assistant, since he lived most of the year outside the United States. The new mural was attacked over and over, once with blue paint and the single word \u201cDisplacers\u201d (in imitation of the Dodgers baseball team\u2019s logo), and another time with crude white spray paint that read: \u201cFuck hipsters.\u201d The anti-gentrification activists were incensed, first because a local real estate agency was sponsoring the mural, which made Romero a sellout in their eyes, and second because Romero\u2019s assistant was white. Pretty soon the wall was back to all white, too. Next on the anti-gentrification taggers\u2019 list was a mural on the side of an upscale bar and deli called Tinfoil (since renamed Flask), where whisky connoisseurs can spend as much as $1,200 on a single bottle. The city itself vetoed Tinfoil\u2019s first idea, which was to turn the mural into an advertisement for Johnny Walker. Instead, the bar commissioned a local Latino artist, Sol Luongo, to produce a montage of Highland Park landmarks under the title Momentos Magicos Magic Moments. One of the features Luongo included was a piece of vernacular art that a graphic designer brought into the neighborhood just a few years ago: a giant statue of a man with a chicken head and a bucket of wings that once adorned a restaurant roof in downtown Los Angeles and now sits on its owner\u2019s roof on Figueroa Boulevard. It has proven a powerful marketing tool for the local business association \u2013 which is exactly why the anti-gentrification crowd hates it. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow Chicken Boy to become the statue of Highland Park. It has nothing to do with Highland Park. That\u2019s some Christopher Columbus shit,\u201d said Brenda Perez, founder of Restorative Justice for the Arts. The mural was tagged repeatedly as it went up, and Luongo became so afraid of one particular activist who hurled abuse at her from the sidewalk that she asked friends to stand by her while she worked. Her mural did get completed, and the bar paid to have it coated in an expensive graffiti-resistant varnish. But it continues to be attacked \u2013 regularly enough for the bar manager to have the city graffiti-cleaning service on his speed-dial. Erasing history Many Highland Park residents and business owners claim the anti-gentrification taggers and protesters are a tiny minority who do not represent the views of a diverse and broadly happy community. On the other hand, many of those same residents and business owners have been shocked by the aggressiveness of property speculators who have bought out apartment buildings and storefronts and either jacked up the rents \u2013 sometimes more than threefold overnight \u2013 or evicted the tenants on short notice. Some of Highland Park\u2019s most revered muralists have themselves been priced out of the neighborhood. And there is a sense, among those who grew up with them in the 1990s and 2000s and are still hanging on \u2013 either because they own their own houses or continue to live in rent-controlled apartment buildings \u2013 that what\u2019s at stake is an essential piece of the city\u2019s soul. \u201cThose of us born and raised in LA know the significance of murals, and those who aren\u2019t from here don\u2019t know,\u201d said Irene Narvaez, the principal of Highland Park High School who grew up locally and now encourages student mural-painting on her own schoolyard. \u201cThere\u2019s more about social justice and history in these murals than my students can learn about in books.\u201d It\u2019s not that the newcomers are hostile to mural art, because most of them aren\u2019t.

The Thunders did it close against the Scorchers, and their fate now hangs on Heat v Renegades - the final regulation season match of BBL09 tomorrow.</p> <p>In the A-League a seven-goal thriller, as Besart Berisha\u2019s brace in his 200th A-League appearance was for naught, as Adelaide won 4-3 late on against Western United. Goals in the W-League too, as Victory improved their spot in the top four with a 3-0 win over Canberra United.</p> <p>Plenty from the Australian Open, headlined by Ash Barty\u2019s nervy fourth round win against Alison Riske, and Novak Djokovic\u2019s comfortable three-setter against Argentina\u2019s Diego Schwartzman.

      "bodyText": "Pretty happy I stuck around for that in the end - a record runscoring match in the BBL, as after Matthew Wade posted the second biggest individual Big Bash score of all time, the Strikers came within a whisker of running down Hobart\u2019s massive total. 424 runs off 240 deliveries. Who\u2019d be a bowler in this modern age. They book their finals spot, to end a dramatic day of Sportwatch. The Thunders did it close against the Scorchers, and their fate now hangs on Heat v Renegades - the final regulation season match of BBL09 tomorrow. In the A-League a seven-goal thriller, as Besart Berisha\u2019s brace in his 200th A-League appearance was for naught, as Adelaide won 4-3 late on against Western United. Goals in the W-League too, as Victory improved their spot in the top four with a 3-0 win over Canberra United. Plenty from the Australian Open, headlined by Ash Barty\u2019s nervy fourth round win against Alison Riske, and Novak Djokovic\u2019s comfortable three-setter against Argentina\u2019s Diego Schwartzman. Thanks for your company, adios! That\u2019s terrific running from the Strikers - they take on the arm off a dicey French cut and push for three; but the replay suggests the man called Short is just short! Valiant running. Siddle strides in: 19 off 4 is the equation. He pushes one. Before Neser opens the shoulders and thumps Ellis over the boundary for six! He tries the repeat dose - a very similar delivery from Ellis - and he catches the pad, the umpire says: yep, lbw! Agar faces the last, just the one off it. And that\u2019s all she wrote! An incredible game of Big Bash. I gave the Strikers next to no chance, but didn\u2019t they give it an absolute crack. The Hurricanes are in the finals - the Scorchers tumble out of the five. And now the Thunder sweat on the Heat\u2019s final game tomorrow night. Big Bash - 6/196 (19), Neser 3*, Short 5* What an over from Faulkner. There\u2019s a near run out - a series of slower balls - but more importantly, no boundaries, no sixers - and he goes for just five. 22 off the final over is the equation. Tough. But not impossible. Big Bash - Wicket! Strikers 6/191 (18.2), Carey 39 out It\u2019s Faulkner v Carey. He beats him first delivery with a crucial dot - wide and swerving outside off. Next ball Carey goes after it - but it\u2019s high, and it\u2019s catchable: and Wright snaffles it! Terrific catch; terrific cricket. And finally, have they broken the back of this Strikers\u2019 innings? Big Bash - Strikers 5/191 (18), Carey 39*, Short 3* And we\u2019ve now seen the most runs EVER in a Big Bash match! Incredible viewing here in Adelaide. It\u2019s a great over from Ellis, but they run the kamikaze two on the final to get Carey back on strike - and a poor throw allows it! He can still get them home, Alex Carey. We are staring at huge 12 huge deliveries is the scope of this game, this season, and possibly George Bailey\u2019s career. Big Bash - Wicket! Strikers 5/185 (17.2), Khan 8 out First ball, and he\u2019s lofted that for six! Khan is in a mood. He shifts in the crease as Ellis steams in, but he\u2019s got him next ball! A great response from the bowler. It catches him low around the toe, and the umpire says: yes, lbw! Pressure bowling from Ellis - what a terrific yorker. Big Bash - Strikers 4/179 (17), Carey 36*, Khan 2* Ooph, that was close to the perfect over from Rose. W 1 1 1 0 - and then final ball? Back over his head for six! Critical from Carey - they\u2019re still eying second spot and the double-chance in the finals knockouts, the Strikers. 39 off 18 to get. Absolutely doable. Big Bash - Wicket! Strikers 4/170 (16.1), Wells 15 out A great seven-ball cameo, but they\u2019re delighted to see the back of him, the \u2018Canes - he\u2019s gone first ball next over! It\u2019s Rose with the breakthrough - a slower spinning delivery and he flicks the stumps. In comes Rashid Khan. What a player to have. The complete T20 party trickster. Will he ramp? Reverse ramp? Paddle it with the handle? WHO KNOWS. Big Bash - Strikers 3/170 (16), Carey 29*, Wells 15* Back to back sixes from Jono Wells! He\u2019s gone after the spin of D\u2019arcy Short. Credit the bowler who fights back a little, just three more off the over. But they\u2019re ahead of the Hurricanes\u2019 innings at this stage! Wade did put in a big finish in one of the final overs from memory, but still. Big Bash - Strikers 3/155 (15), Carey 28*, Wells 1* It started with a wicket, it finished with three boundaries! 13 off the over - despite the wickets, they just continue to hang in there, the Strikers. Carey is seeing it nicely and Wells has strode to the crease a player in form. We\u2019re at the three-quarter mark - and is it possible, is it even conceivable that the Strikers might run this mammoth total down? Big Bash - Wicket! Strikers 3/142 (14.1), Head 47 out Can you believe it - first ball from Boland; and it\u2019s one of the most unfortunate wickets you\u2019ll see. He\u2019s tried the sweep, the skipper, only got a bottom edge and dragged it back on the stumps - but it\u2019s only JUST flicked the legside bail! On such margins etc. Big Bash - Strikers 2/142 (14), Carey 16*, Head 47* They need a wicket, the Hurricanes - these two are really starting to find their groove. He\u2019s hit about 30 off 12 or so, Head, so he\u2019s definitely accelerated. Carey\u2019s seeing it nicely too, as they dispatch Short to the ropes with abandon. Big Bash - Strikers 2/124 (12), Carey 13*, Head 32* Here it comes. Now the skipper\u2019s finally got hold of Qais Ahmad and Head has started to pick up the mantle from Salt. And then Carey puts the spinner in the stands! This is some batting pitch, and both sides are seeing in cleanly tonight. 12 off that over as well. That\u2019s what they need from here - run rates\u2019 just a tick under 2 a ball; which normally you\u2019d say is impossible, but... Big Bash - Wicket! Strikers 2/99 (9.4), Salt 66 out Big wicket! With 66 off 33 Salt looked the man to get the Strikers home - but with Head scratchy and now some tails up, can the Hurricanes bowlers knock over Alex Carey? He takes on the boundary riders once again, but this time Short snaffles one on the rope. Again, you just can\u2019t call a Big Bash game early (see - Sportwatch two weeks ago, re Heat\u2019s 10 wicket collapse), but these are decisive overs for the \u2018Canes season right here. Big Bash - Strikers 1/79 (8), Salt 57*, Head 10* Fascinating patch of the contest - a wicket, a few slow overs and the screws could start to turn on the Strikers. But a big 20+ over or two? There\u2019s a big crowd in in Adelaide, and they\u2019re jumping on every boundary to cheer their boys on. Nicely poised. And you wouldn\u2019t think that chasing 200+. Big Bash - Strikers 1/70 (7), Salt 50*, Head 8* First look at Qais, the spinner, and he pins Travis Head at the crease a little. He can\u2019t allow too many dots, or the scoreboard pressure will rise astronomically on the Strikers. Salt grabs his half-century. George Bailey will be grinding his teeth after dropping him on 4. Great over from Qais Ahmad - just four from it. Big Bash - Strikers 1/57 (5), Salt 41*, Head 5* Righto, I gave them five overs, but when Salt\u2019s in this mood I might hang around a little longer. He whacks Boland for six, and next ball finds the boundary. 14 off the over. We know that it\u2019s an imposing total, but so far - they\u2019re on track, the Strikers. Big Bash - Strikers 1/36 (3), Salt 24*, Head 1* Poor old James Faulkner. A catch dropped in the first over, now he\u2019s copping four byes off an excellent slower ball that evades both batsmen and \u2018keeper. A good over in the end - 15 off it. They do pick up Weatherald at the other end, so there\u2019s an early wicket, but it does look like Salt will be the danger man for the Hurricanes. Can he capitalise on that first-over let off? Nerves, what nerves? Barty starts the ninth game of the third set with real intention, and the crowd squeals with excitement as she peels off two terrific winners to swing momentum. Missed any of this one? Follow Daniel Harris\u2019 Australian Open liveblog - and don\u2019t forget - Federer to come: Big Bash - Strikers 0/14 (1), Salt 13*, Weatherald 1* And we\u2019re away! Salt goes after the very first delivery, and he finds the rope. No guessing how they\u2019re going to go about this, then the Strikers. And then - would you believe it: of all people - second ball it\u2019s George Bailey who drops a sitter! It dollied to him at midwicket - and the hands were cold. Salt takes the let off - he sends Faulkner to the rope twice more, and they\u2019re 1/20 of the way there, the Strikers. While we wait for that - don\u2019t forget the Barty Party is of course in action on centre court in Melbourne. It\u2019s been a see-sawer for the World No 1 - an imposing first set, followed by a real wobble in the second. She\u2019s fought back in the decider though - don\u2019t miss a single shot of that one, here: End of Innings: Hurricanes 1/217 (20), Wade 130* It\u2019s a highest team total at the Adelaide Oval and a personal PB for Wade. 130* off 61. An absolutely brutal display of T20 batting. The Strikers have been absolutely walloped. Can they regroup in the sheds, try and make a decent start and then see if they can run this down? My Sunday night Cinderella carriage has just pulled up, but maybe out of the goodness of my heart I\u2019ll stick round a little longer to find out. You get five overs, Strikers. Or you\u2019ve lost me. Big Bash - Hurricanes 1/207 (19), Wade 122*, McDermott 2* And they get Short! You\u2019d have to say too little, too late, but at least some positive morale for the Strikers. He holes out in the deep and that was a tricky catch for Salt. It flew right into the night\u2019s sky and hung there forever, but he held it well. Just five off the over from Neser, that\u2019s better. What can they do to finish it, the Hurricanes? Big Bash - Hurricanes 0/202 (18), Wade 119*, Short 72* Short has really come to the party as well. Perhaps out of embarrassment at just how quickly Wade has gone - and he\u2019s just put Siddle over the rope, twice. Even metronomic Pete can\u2019t avoid the onslaught. Somebody check the record books. Highest total? Most sixes? Most bowlers going for over 8+? Highest all-time partnership? Big Bash - Hurricanes 0/185 (17), Wade 117*, Short 57* Wade\u2019s just gone 6, 6, 4 off Agar - and he\u2019s rattled the entire Strikers\u2019 XI here. Now it\u2019s a big wide from Agar. The injury wouldn\u2019t have helped him, but this mental battering is taking effect. And then Short hits him for six too. 25 off the over. Big Bash - Hurricanes 0/160 (16), Wade century! It\u2019s taken him just 48 balls, but the \u2018Canes skipper - just when they needed him, has stood tall! Finally, even Peter Siddle goes for some stick. And at the other end, Short brings up his 50. Incredibly also off 48 balls - which just shows you how quickly Wade is going. This could be a 200-er from the Hurricanes. And you\u2019d have to say, surely that books them a finals spot? Surely. Big Bash - Hurricanes 0/138 (14), Wade 90*, Short 39* Ouch. We\u2019ve an injury break after a nasty knock on the bone for Wes Agar. Was that shin? Knee? He\u2019s moving very gingerly, although at least he\u2019s back on his feet. For two batsmen absolutely flying is their a danger of this break arresting momentum? They\u2019re both very experienced so perhaps not - but it\u2019s a welcome chance to catch breath for the Strikers. Agar somehow finishes the over - great courage - and would you believe, it\u2019s the best of the innings for the Strikers. Just two off it. And there\u2019s the final whistle - what an absolute rollercoaster. It\u2019s a first senior football league game at Whitten Oval after an incredible 25-year wait between drinks - fans will be hoping they play here every weekend! More one for the neutrals, mind - no coach or fan wants to see their players ship three or four a game. A big crash back to earth for Western United who looked imperious last weekend putting the Mariners to the sword 3-0. But it seems that was the exception rather than the rule, with the run now three losses from four. Big points for Adelaide, who jump above Western United into the top six. Can they push on from here? Big BAsh - Hurricanes 0/125 (12), Wade 85*, Short 32* It could be some batting pitch this, but Wade is having an absolute field day. Even Rashid Khan has come in for some real stick here - 12 off the over. Shows the quality of Peter Siddle - the bowling card reads: 6 bowlers going for 8.5+ an over (Stanlake\u2019s 22 the outlier, but plenty of 10+) and Siddle? 4.5. This is something special from Wade though - nine boundaries and FOUR sixes so far. The last of which was caught deep in the crowd by a lad on his buck\u2019s weekend. Larks. A-League - Goal! Western United 3-4 Adelaide (Konstandopoulos) 79 min: Mias dias. (With apologies to Spanish speakers). What is the lord\u2019s sweet kingdom is going on here. We\u2019ve a SEVENTH goal of the game. And this after a 0-0 and 1-0 via a dodgy own-goal yesterday. The youngster off the bench has joined the party, and what a hit from the midfielder! It\u2019s a half-clearance from the Western United defence, but it only finds Konstandopoulos - who curls a terrific effort past the outstretched Kurto! They\u2019re back in front, Adelaide - again! Big Bash - Hurricanes 0/91 (8), Wade 58*, Short 25* It\u2019s normally Short who throws the hands at them, but it\u2019s Wade who\u2019s come out of the blocks raring today. It\u2019s big Billy Stanlake who comes in for attention as Wade one-hand clubs him off leg for four. Oh dear. And now he\u2019s gone for six! And on the final ball of the over - an almost replica shot - he\u2019s dropped in the deep! A tough chance, was perhaps falling short, ut still. 22 off the over. Ouch. And they\u2019re absolutely flying, the \u2018Canes. A-League - 70 min: And in the context of this game, you want to say a lull - but I promise you, it continues to be end-to-end. Max Burgess seems determined to be an X-factor for Western United, while in the absence of Ersum Gulum (departed the club), Connor Chapman (departed the club), Brendan Hamill (injured) and Aaron Calver (injured) - it\u2019s fair to say the home side\u2019s backline is struggling to come to grips with the likes of McGree, Troisi and Mileusnic. Big Bash - Hurricanes 0/38 (4), Wade 18*, Short 15* Good over here from Siddle, who goes for just five. It was a lively first three overs - with both batsmen looking \u201cin a mood\u201d. Neser and Short going for 11 and 12 respective - five fours off the first three overs. Build a partnership here and it could look decent for the Hurricanes\u2019 finals hopes. Remember, we\u2019ve got three teams booked into the final five ahead of this, the penultimate game of BBL09: Stars, Sixers and Strikers. And then there\u2019s a four-into-two magic act - with both the Hurricanes and the Heat with their fate in their own hands. Win here and they leap above the Scorchers, with net run rate narrowly sneaking Hobart past the Thunder as well. And then even if the Heat win tomorrow, they sit secure in the top five. A-League - Goal! Western United 3-3 Adelaide (Diamanti) 54 min: Bloody hell. This game isn\u2019t letting up! Cometh the almost hour, and who else - the Western United skipper and mercurial talent, Alessandro Diamanti who finally gets in on the act! The youngster Louis D\u2019Arrigo gets his pocket picked in midfield and they feed the skipper on the edge of the box. He only ever has one thing in mind - jinking back onto his superb left foot, and he rifles an unstoppable effort past Izzo! 3-3. Are you not entertained, Footscray?? Now - let\u2019s get to Adelaide where we\u2019re finally underway in the late BBL clash between the Strikers and the Hurricanes. It\u2019s the visitors who have won the toss and elected to bat - Matthew Wade and D\u2019Arcy Short are the men send out to try and secure this crucial win for the side from Hobart. Fairly decent pair, let\u2019s see how they fare. A-League - second half! We\u2019re back! Five goals in that first half - can we expect six at Whitten Oval in the second? Judging by the tambour of Mark Rudan\u2019s brief half-time chat with broadcaster Fox Sports, you\u2019d imagine if even one more goal is scored by Adelaide United he\u2019ll be going nuclear. Gertjan Verbeek is no shrinking violet either - so let\u2019s just say defences may find their resolves a little stiffened during that break in play. And what\u2019s happening in the Tour Down Under - I hear cycling fans scream? Fret no longer. Great to see Tasmania\u2019s finest Richie Porte - back on the podium: Some other big ticket items going on around the globe - there\u2019s more Test cricket action just getting underway in South Africa, and it\u2019s good news for the visiting England team who have an early breakthrough: Right - it\u2019s officially Barty Party O\u2019Clock in Melbourne - as the World No 1 and as of yesterday Young Australian of the Year Ash Barty strides out for her fourth round clash. I\u2019m going to step away from the tennis and redirect you to the impeccable hands of Daniel Harris to take you through the evening\u2019s matches: Australian Open: Sandgren 7-6, 5-5 Fognini * A comical game, as Sandgren hits three consecutive lets, to the fascination of the crowd, and even a smile from the chair umpire. He eventually holds to love, a needed settler for the American - and it sets us up nicely for another late-set tussle. A-League: Western United 3-2 Adelaide - Half-time So there\u2019s the final whistle on a pulsating first stanza. You\u2019d have to say, I don\u2019t imagine either coach would be happy with what they\u2019ve seen - which is remarkable to say, when you\u2019ve either witnessed your team score two, or three goals. Australian Open: * Sandgren 7-6, 4-5 Fognini This has been an incredible 15-20 minutes from the Italian! He looked out - physically and mentally - but with Sandgren cruising at 4-1, 30-15, he\u2019s just picked himself up from the canvas. Incredibly, that\u2019s five games in a row for the 12th seed. Sandgren offered a wry smile when he dropped his serve for 4-2, not now. It was a foot fault call and then a time violation that had Fognini loosing his rattle - but all that drama seems to have helped him lift his game. And suddenly, it\u2019s Sandgren serving to stay in the second set. A-League: Goal! Western United 2-3 Adelaide (Berisha) 42 min: Oh my. What is going on here. It\u2019s Burgess again the creator, who provides the forward momentum before sliding a fine ball in behind for Pain. It\u2019s a fierce, whipped, first-time ball and who\u2019s on the end of it? Mr 200 games! A double for Berisha as he somehow sneaks between two defenders to bundle home! What an incredible half of football. Australian Open: Sandgren 7-6, 4-2 Fognini * You have to say, Fognini is in all sorts here. He\u2019s remonstrating with the chair umpire, he\u2019s taking medical breaks. But with Sandgren leading 4-1, 30-15 he\u2019s come back to get the break! Big cheers from his supporters. The American perhaps for one second just thought he was walking the second set. Not anymore. A few lazy shots, and then an incredible scramble by the Italian at 30-40 to clinch the break. What a point! A-League - 30 min: So, you\u2019d hardly say it\u2019s settled down, but after that frenetic series of goals, there\u2019s a marginally more gentle ebb and flow to this one now. Still opportunities at both ends - Burgess tries to jink inside, before Diamanti tries an effort. It\u2019s a statement of obvious at this stage but this is a very open game of football. A-League: Goal! Western United 1-3 Adelaide (McGree) 18 min: Goodness gracious! You have to fault the \u2018keeper here, although maybe there\u2019s a very slight touch that puts off the usually impeccable Pole. It\u2019s a cross in from Halloran and it\u2019s driven hard and low straight through the arms of Kurto. Defences optional - football\u2019s back at Whitton Park, with verve! A-League: Goal! Western United 1-2 Adelaide (Mileusnic) 15 min: Crikey. It\u2019s a turnover in midfield by James Troisi (albeit with some hint of a possible foul?) and he feeds Blackwood who runs at the retreating defence. He squares it for a late-arriving Mileusnic who tucks into the roof of the net! What a frenetic start to this game! Mark Rudan will be chewing wasps. A-League: Goal! Western United 1-1 Adelaide (Berisha) 12 min: Well, twice bitten, thrice very angry. He uncoils like a cobra - and whack! Berisha finally sinks his teeth into this contest. A great run from Max Burgess to give Western United some forward momentum - he rolls it to the Kosovan who digs it out of his feet nicely and lashes home past Paul Izzo. Game on! A-League: Goal! Western United 0-1 Adelaide (Mileusnic) 9 min: It was the home side who started the brighter with Berisha spurning two chances in quick succession, but it\u2019s the visitors who take the lead! Fine work from George Blackwood who jinks along the goalline before the ball falls to Nikola Mileusnic who lashes home from near the edge of the box! Australia Open: Tennys Sandgren takes the first set 7-6 (7-5) With a name like this he was almost predestined to the sport, but the American Sandgren has hung on in a see-sawing first set tiebreaker. Some uncharacteristic errors from Fabio Fognini saw the American skip to a 4-0 lead, but a string of fine errors tightened things back up at 4-3. The American grabbing all-import mini-break on another Fognini error. Big set that - almost an hour played. Now - we\u2019ve got A-League action just getting underway from Melbourne\u2019s west where it\u2019s Western United hosting Adelaide United - an intriguing fixture, this one. More on that anon. At the Australian Open it\u2019s Tennys Sandgren and Fabio Fognini presently locking horns. Many would have favoured the Italian, he is the 12th seed after all, but he\u2019s finding it tough at the moment, deep in the first. And we\u2019ll have more Big Bash action shortly - from Adelaide where the Strikers play host to the Hurricanes in a match that could have all sorts of permutations for the finals spots. They love their Tash Dowie down there in Melbourne, and Victoy\u2019s skipper has been at the heart of things once more. Melina Ayres got things going for the home side with a brace late in the first half, before a goal for the big English striker. They were disciplined at the back and ruthless up front - and you could feel the air draining out of this (predominantly) young Canberra United. Their finals chances are well gone, but for Victory - a spot in the finals looks likely theirs. Evening all! Thanks JP, another sterling turn at the wheel. I said this yesterday, but gee - there\u2019s some sport flying round this weekend. A quick round the grounds to come, but let\u2019s start at Lakeside Stadium in Melbourne, with the W-League. To see you through the remainder of the night and fill you in on all the BBL permutations as they happen, it\u2019s over to Richard Parkin. BBL: Hobart play Adelaide tonight and Brisbane take on the Renegades tomorrow. The Hurricanes and Heat can both disrupt the order of the top five so neither the Thunder nor the Scorchers can rest easy. What a finish! With just two balls remaining! Chris Morris settles the Thunder\u2019s nerves with a six then a four after a simple cruise turned into a jittery nightmare. It\u2019s a massive result in the context of the season because it vaults the Thunder from seventh up to fourth and in pole position for a spot in the finals with just two matches remaining. The Scorchers drop to fifth and face a nail-biting wait to find out if they will feature again this season. BBL: Make that three from three - Chris Morris has drilled a six into the sight-screen to the delight of the Sydney Thunder crowd. BBL: Three from the first two balls of Matt Kelly\u2019s over. Nine from four required. W-League: 84 mins: Melbourne Victory 3-0 Canberra United - Melbourne Victory in cruise control. BBL: An incredible over from Jhye Richardson has transformed this match. Sydney Thunder now require 12 runs from the final over to beat Perth Scorchers. Australian Open: Kevin Mitchell was courtside to witness the end of Coco Gauff\u2019s remarkable Australian Open. W-League: HT: Melbourne Victory 2-0 Canberra United - Melbourne Victory are in a rich vein of form in the W-League and they look set to continue their march up the ladder against Canberra United, who are beginning to lose touch with the pack in the race for the finals. Big Bash League: Sydney Thunder are on their way to victory against Perth Scorchers in a rain-affected clash in NSW. The visitors made 99 before their innings was cut short by rain in the 15th over. The Thunder are cruising in their DLS-influenced chase. I spoke too soon. Back to the Australian Open for confirmation of another remarkable victory for Ons Jabeur. The Tunisian has now defeated 12th seed Johanna Konta, recent top-tenner Caroline Garcia, 2018 champion Caroline Wozniacki, and now the conqueror of Serena Williams, Wang Qiang. Time to broaden our horizons for the next hour or so and catch-up with what\u2019s been going on outside Melbourne Park today. Not one for the highlights reel, but Novak Djokovic had too much for Diego Schwartzman. Both men averaged ten unforced errors per set and the Argentinian 14th seed landed only 56% of first serves. Third set: Djokovic* 6-3 6-4 6-4 Schwartzman (*denotes server): Schwartzman shows incredible hustle to stay in the opening point - but he still loses it. Djokovic then moves up 30-0 with some rasping forehands and 40-0 with some driving backhands. The seven-time champion secures the win when his opponent returns wide. A 46th grand slam quarter-final awaits the second seed. Third set: Djokovic 6-3 6-4 5-4 Schwartzman* (*denotes server): Djokovic can scent victory at 15-30 but the latest in a long line of awkward error-strewn games ends with a hold. This was a far from classic game in a far from classic match. Djokovic will serve for the spoils. Cocomania is over for another slam. Third set: Djokovic* 6-3 6-4 5-3 Schwartzman (*denotes server): Some rare creativity from Schwartzman this game, unfurling a tweener then a Djokovic-esque drop shot to stay in the mix at 15-15. The champ then muscles his way to a hold to 30. Third set: Djokovic 6-3 6-4 4-3 Schwartzman* (*denotes server): Two double faults bookend consecutive unforced errors to leave the game balanced at 30-30. Djokovic then steams into a weak second serve to bully his way to break point but he throws that opportunity away by missing his backhand by some margin. Schwartzman returns the favour at deuce to concede his second break point of the game but he saves it with a serve his opponent cannot return. Djokovic then commands the second deuce to engineer a third break point but again an uncharacteristic error keeps the game alive. Schwartzman finally gets his nose in front on deuce three, and a couple of quick points behind forceful serves settle his nerves. Third set: Djokovic* 6-3 6-4 4-2 Schwartzman (*denotes server): Djokovic slips to 0-30 with consecutive unforced errors but then turns on the afterburners to serve his way level. 30-30 becomes 40-30 after a 21-shot rally that ends with Djokovic finally nailing the change-up drop shot. But he still allows deuce to arrive when he misses the target with a forehand down the line. Both men then scrap hard in scenes reminiscent of the opening set but both concede errors, Schwartzman under pressure, Djokovic not, to invite a second deuce. Here Djokovic misses with a low-percentage backhand down the line to gift a break point, but he saves it with the latest in a long line of crunching forehands too hot for even the most redoubtable of defenders. Deuce three is more routine and Djokovic consolidates the break. Third set: Djokovic 6-3 6-4 3-2 Schwartzman* (*denotes server): The first pressure on either server this set arrives when Schwartzman tries to shorten a rally too soon and slaps his forehand wide. That pressure tells with just his third double fault of the match then intensifies in a nervous point that results in a break of serve to love. Djokovic can begin steeling himself for the ice bath. Third set: Djokovic* 6-3 6-4 2-2 Schwartzman (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to love, sealing the game with a second serve ace after earlier winning a point in fortunate circumstances when he was wrong-footed by a net cord but still managed to spin 180 degrees and jab a backhand winner. Third set: Djokovic 6-3 6-4 1-2 Schwartzman* (*denotes server): Better from Schwartzman, demonstrating some intensity for the first time since early in the opening set and crafting some neat points to hold to 15. The highlight is a seven-shot rally (the longest in about an hour) that ends with a miraculous stopping half-volley backhand at the net that does just enough for the Argentinian. Third set: Djokovic* 6-3 6-4 1-1 Schwartzman (*denotes server): Schwartzman edges to 15-30, profiting from another well executed lob - and poor approach play from his opponent. Undeterred, Djokovic serves his way powerfully to the hold. Djokovic does not look completely at ease out there, muttering to himself often and now glaring at someone in the crowd. He has performed well below his best, despite the scoreline. Third set: Djokovic 6-3 6-4 0-1 Schwartzman* (*denotes server): Despite the defensive skills of both men, rallies have been in short supply in the past few games. The pattern continues with a below-par Djokovic gifting Schwartzman a simple hold to open the third set. Second set: Djokovic* 6-3 6-4 Schwartzman (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to love and the second set is his. Not a vintage game, set, or match so far, but the champion is within touching distance of a quarter-final date with Milos Raonic. The challenge system tends to be pretty low-key but it\u2019s really added to the stop-start nature of this match, one that has really struggled for rhythm. Second set: Djokovic 6-3 5-4 Schwartzman* (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set Schwartzman holds to 30 but the game\u2019s highlight is a return winner from a full stretch Djokovic who managed to land the forehand n the darkest corner of the court. Second set: Djokovic* 6-3 5-3 Schwartzman (*denotes server): Quite a few games today have lacked impetus. The crowd doesn\u2019t seem fully engaged yet and there have been lots of passages featuring short rallies and soft errors. This is another example, but Djokovic holds with a 194kph ace that catches the line. Second set: Djokovic 6-3 4-3 Schwartzman* (*denotes server): Schwartzman dashes out to 40-0 courtesy of some wasteful tennis from Djokovic, but the champ recovers focus to 40-30 before a 23-shot rally has the crowd on its feet. It could go either way and just as Djokovic moves in for the kill at the net Schwartzman rips a fizzing forehand down the line that just stays in court to secure the hold. Second set: Djokovic* 6-3 4-2 Schwartzman (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to love. Just what the Djoctor ordered. Second set: Djokovic 6-3 3-2 Schwartzman* (*denotes server): There\u2019s a definite momentum swing occurring. Djokovic looks to have the opening point sewn up but he declines to attack a Schwartzman lob only to turn and see it bounce delicately in court. There\u2019s still life in the game at 40-30 but the Argentinian pulls out a stunner to force Djokovic onto the defensive at the net, then hammers a couple of shots in the Serbian\u2019s direction, forcing some reflex self-preservation, before putting away the winner. Second set: Djokovic* 6-3 3-1 Schwartzman (*denotes server): After all the points flowing Djokovic\u2019s way it\u2019s a surprise to see the scoreline read 0-30. Obviously what happens next is an inside-out forehand winner down the line winner, followed up by a booming serve. But Schwartzman returns the serve, then somehow guesses right when Djokovic has two golden opportunities to hammer home a winner, eventually chasing down a drop shot to clip a winner. Unexpectedly the 14th seed has two break points, his first of the match. Djokovic saves the first but not the second, again opting for the ill-advised drop shot. He really needs to put that club back in his bag today. A bit more energy in the crowd and Schwartzman has one of his breaks back. Second set: Djokovic 6-3 3-0 Schwartzman* (*denotes server): For the umpteenth time today Schwartzman struggles to 0-30 and for the umpteenth time today Djokovic opens his body and rips out that forehand down the line for a winner. The Argentinian saves his first break point of the match but he follows that up by dumping a volley into the net to hand his Serbian opponent a double break. One-way traffic on Rod Laver Arena. Second set: Djokovic* 6-3 2-0 Schwartzman (*denotes server): Simple hold for the champ, punctuated with more examples of his point exposition. His ability to hit with momentum from corner to corner, setting up the in-to-out forehand down the line to the open court is so technical and brilliant. Second set: Djokovic 6-3 1-0 Schwartzman* (*denotes server): Again, errors abound as the score moves to 30-30 before Schwartzman invites pressure with a backhand slice into the net. A superb return from Djokovic sets up his second break of the match. For a man lacking weapons, Schwartzman is delivering far too inconsistently today, especially on serve. He\u2019s going to need Djokovic to drop a level or two to remain in the hunt. Milos Raonic, the 2016 semi-finalist, is back in the quarters. Marin Cilic\u2019s entertaining run from outside the seeds is over. The Canadian awaits the winner of the match in progress on RLA. First set: Djokovic* 6-3 Schwartzman (*denotes server): There are real peaks and troughs in this contest and game nine begins with a trough, Djokovic leaking to 15-30 with a double fault. He regains parity by wrong-footing Schwartzman and sending his opponent to the court in the process, the Argentinian\u2019s shoes losing grip mid-turn. The Serbian then berates himself despite moving 40-30 ahead, unhappy with his approach prior to gliding into the net. He seals the opening set when his opponent\u2019s return doesn\u2019t clear the net. Not an especially memorable opening set, but Novak Djokovic is on the board. First set: Djokovic 5-3 Schwartzman* (*denotes server): A sloppy start to the game from both men sees the score drip to 30-30 before a rare killer serve sees Schwartzman edge ahead. Djokovic hits back to force deuce with one of the points of the match, testing his opponent\u2019s defence to its limits before eventually engineering enough open court to hammer the winner. The errors return during the first deuce before Djokovic comes out on top with an inside-out forehand down the line winner. The first break point of the day is on Djokovic\u2019s racket and after a bruising baseline exchange Schwartzman blinks, finds the net, and the second seed will serve for the set. Schwartzman is serving at just 54% so far. He can\u2019t beat a man of Djokovic\u2019s class with numbers like that. First set: Djokovic* 4-3 Schwartzman (*denotes server): Djokovic concedes the opening point with another questionable drop shot but recovers to 30-15 with a classic Djokovic point, pounding massive forehands from corner to corner like George Foreman working a heavy bag. A second attempted drop shot comes off - just - as the seven-time champion sees out another routine service game. First set: Djokovic 3-3 Schwartzman* (*denotes server): There are rarely cheap points on Schwartzman\u2019s serve (he\u2019s only 5\u20197\u201d) but he is well below par today allowing Djokovic plenty of opportunity to take the ascendancy. For the third game in a row the Serbian is in with an early look but 0-30 quickly becomes 40-30 when the 14th seed steps on the gas and that converts into a hold when Schwartzman punishes a Djokovic net cord. First set: Djokovic* 3-2 Schwartzman (*denotes server): Another easy hold for the defending champ. Both men are among the best defenders on tour - heck, Djokovic is probably the best defensive player in tennis history - which means most rallies feature a shot or two more than might normally be expected. Djokovic is keen to test Schwartzman\u2019s footwork, drawing him into the net with drop shots, but the Argentinian is rapid and has chased down each attempt so far. First set: Djokovic 2-2 Schwartzman* (*denotes server): Schwartzman is only landing about half his first serves in this early phase of the match, and his second serves are pretty tame, allowing Djokovic plenty of opportunity to attack. The Serbian forces his way to 30-30 but for the second return game in a row a couple of cheap unforced errors end any thoughts of a break. First set: Djokovic* 2-1 Schwartzman (*denotes server): Emphatic hold from Djokovic who is hitting his ground strokes with some serious intent. There is a resounding pop off the racket that is pushing Schwartzman onto his heels and making it difficult for last as long as he would hope going toe-to-toe. First set: Djokovic 1-1 Schwartzman* (*denotes server): Djokovic asserts himself early in the game, powering to 0-30 with some powerful forehands crosscourt. Schwartzman then offers a tame second serve that Djokovic can\u2019t capitalise on, before the second seed gifts four points in a row with some pretty ordinary errors by his high standards. Djokovic has now dispensed with his cap, while Schwartzman\u2019s is on back-to-front. First set: Djokovic* 1-0 Schwartzman (*denotes server): Both players look in decent touch early on with Schwartzman moving well to cover plenty of ground during Djokovic\u2019s opening service game. In particular, the Argentinian came out on top of a high-quality rally at 30-15 to send a message to his favoured opponent he will be a tough nut to crack. A couple of errors extend the game to deuce but the Serbian nails a pair of first serves to see off any threat. Both men are sporting white baseball caps for today\u2019s match, an indication of the glare caused by the sunlight streaming through the open roof on RLA. Rod Laver, incidentally, is courtside for this one, deservedly occupying the best seats in the house. Margaret Court is a few seats along. All eyes will be on her tomorrow, the 50th anniversary of her calendar year grand slam. Ok, Rod Laver Arena is now ready for the main event of the afternoon. Melbourne Park is bathed in warm sunshine with temperatures kept in check by a southerly breeze. Second seed Novak Djokovic is out preparing for what promises to be a tough fourth round contest against 14th seed Diego Schwartzman. The defending champion was forced to work hard in his opening round but has since cruised beyond his next two opponents. Schwartzman, the 14th seed, is a major step up in class. The Argentinian stands only 170cm tall, but what he lacks in stature he makes up for him determination. He has yet to drop a set during the championships and that includes breezing past the in-form Dusan Lajovic in round three. Djokovic and Schwartzman have met three times previously, Djokovic winning them all, but the past two encounters (admittedly both on clay) have each gone the distance. The schedule on RLA is delayed a smidgen by Petra Kvitova requiring three sets to work her way beyond Maria Sakkari. Novak Djokovic will be on court shortly. The first fourth round result of the day is in and it\u2019s a rare victory for a favourite in the women\u2019s draw. Petra Kvitova (7) needed to dig deep to force her way past Maria Sakkari (22) 6-7 6-3 6-2 but one of the most popular players on tour remains on course for her first grand slam title since 2014. Next up for last year\u2019s beaten finalist is a quarter-final against the winner of top seed Ash Barty\u2019s clash with Alison Riske (18). Some terrific Australia Day news for the Olyroos. They defeated Uzbekistan overnight to secure the final Asian qualification spot for Tokyo 2020. An early check on 2018 finalist Marin Cilic, and the news isn\u2019t great. There\u2019s also some more positive news for Ash Barty who adds to her growing collection of gongs with an Australian of the Year honour. The big news from overnight is the continued presence of Nick Kyrgios in the Australian Open draw. His gritty victory against Karen Khachanov has set up a mouth-watering fourth round contest against old foe Rafael Nadal. Hello everybody and welcome to an action-packed Australia Day Sportwatch. It\u2019s going to be a day of two halves on this page. In between the lamingtons and Hot-100, the early phase will focus on day seven of the Australian Open with game-by-game coverage of Novak Djokovic\u2019s fourth round clash with Diego Schwartzman. That one gets underway shortly on Rod Laver Arena. As the day progresses we\u2019ll bring you all the other scores and news from around Melbourne Park with a schedule featuring Petra Kvitova, Marin Cilic and Coco Gauff, among others. After 6pm (AEST) we\u2019ll hand over the tennis to its own dedicated night session liveblog and this page will focus on Australian domestic sport. The headline acts will be Western United v Adelaide United in the A-League (6pm k.o.), and Adelaide Strikers v Hobart Hurricanes in the BBL (7.10pm start). In amongst all that we have the conclusion of the Tour Down Under, Melbourne Victory v Canberra United in the W-League, and Sydney Thunder v Perth Scorchers in the early BBL clash to update you on.

When asked about reports that Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, was considering an evacuation of more than 200 Britons trapped in the city, the home secretary said the UK was \u201clooking at all the options\u201d. She said there were still no confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, after tests on 31 people came back negative. The Foreign Office has advised against all travel to Hubei province but not announced that it will evacuate Britons. This is in contrast to France and Japan, who are putting in place logistics to get their citizens out. The UK government has been criticised for being slow off the mark to find and give information to the thousands of people in Britain who have flown back from Wuhan in recent weeks. Prof Martin Dove, a British academic, said no one from the UK government had tried to contact him regarding the coronavirus outbreak despite him having recently returned home from working in Wuhan from 3-12 January. However, Patel insisted the government was taking \u201call the precautions and the right measures\u201d working with the World Health Organization and Public Health England. She told Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme: \u201cThere are many efforts being made and the Border Force provides information to Public Health England. They are contacting people and reaching out and providing screening and testing. That is in hand.\u201d The home secretary said Public Health England had a hub at Heathrow airport as part of Britain\u2019s efforts to prevent the spread of the virus. Later, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that the Foreign Office would continue to monitor whether to try to rescue Britons in Wuhan and would keep it under review.",

      "body": "<p>Although I\u2019ve been reviewing books for half a century, this little treatise caused me to do some anxious head-scratching. <a href=\"https://www.phillipachong.com/\" title=\"\">Phillipa Chong</a>, a tenure-hungry assistant professor at a Canadian university, here presents an earnest sociological analysis of an activity that for me has been sometimes a chore, always a test of punctuality and proficiency, on occasion a wickedly thrilling chance for retaliation, but mostly a source of pleasure. Reading the product of Chong\u2019s jargon-clogged research, I found that I lacked all symptoms of the professional malaise that afflicts her informants, who suffer, she believes, from \u201cepistemic uncertainty\u201d.</p> <p>I may be a shallow fellow, but I\u2019ve never worried about what Chong clumsily describes as the \u201clack of groupness\u201d among reviewers. Who cares that no certificates of \u201caccreditation\u201d enrol us in \u201cthe institution of literary criticism\u201d or that we \u201cinhabit nonprofessional spaces\u201d?

      "bodyText": "Although I\u2019ve been reviewing books for half a century, this little treatise caused me to do some anxious head-scratching. Phillipa Chong, a tenure-hungry assistant professor at a Canadian university, here presents an earnest sociological analysis of an activity that for me has been sometimes a chore, always a test of punctuality and proficiency, on occasion a wickedly thrilling chance for retaliation, but mostly a source of pleasure. Reading the product of Chong\u2019s jargon-clogged research, I found that I lacked all symptoms of the professional malaise that afflicts her informants, who suffer, she believes, from \u201cepistemic uncertainty\u201d. I may be a shallow fellow, but I\u2019ve never worried about what Chong clumsily describes as the \u201clack of groupness\u201d among reviewers. Who cares that no certificates of \u201caccreditation\u201d enrol us in \u201cthe institution of literary criticism\u201d or that we \u201cinhabit nonprofessional spaces\u201d? I also hadn\u2019t realised that I was supposed to function as a \u201cmarket intermediary\u201d or \u2013 with luck \u2013 as a \u201ccultural consecrator\u201d. And none of the eight successive Observer literary editors for whom I have worked ever ordered contributors to \u201cenact their duties\u201d, which would have sounded unusually bossy. When they patted me on the back, was I being commended for \u201csatisficing in the face of practical constraints\u201d? I hope so, because satisficing, I gather, is a \u201ccognitive heuristic\u201d that defines an \u201cacceptability threshold\u201d. Editors are employers and I\u2019ve always been reluctant to question their reasons for commissioning me. Now I learn from Chong that they exercise \u201chomophilous logics\u201d resembling the algorithms that connect strangers on hook-up websites. This prompts her to liken assigning reviews to \u201cmaking a good match\u201d: well, then, next time a Jiffy bag arrives, I\u2019ll regard it as the invitation to go on a blind date.

It makes sense that the quiet, happy person in the corner gets ignored. It was only when I was in hospital for an operation on my arthritic hand \u2013 aged 65 \u2013 that the fact I can\u2019t feel pain finally came to light.</p> <p>I\u2019d only recently had a long-overdue hip replacement. \u201cThis will hurt more than the last one, you\u2019ll need more painkillers,\u201d the hospital anaesthetist had told me. I offered to bet any money it wouldn\u2019t when I looked up at him with a smile.</p> <p>He came to see me after the procedure and I wiggled my hand in his face, proudly. \u201cNo painkillers,\u201d I said, grinning, \u201cand no pain either.\u201d</p> <p>Down in London, I went for tests at University College Hospital. In the experiments, my husband was used as the standard \u2013 they even took a biopsy from his leg. The researchers found an abundance of a substance called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/mar/28/scientists-find-genetic-mutation-that-makes-woman-feel-no-pain\" title=\"\">anandamide</a> in my body \u2013 so much that I never experience anxiety, fear or pain. Instead, my genes make me happy and forgetful \u2013 finally, an explanation for why it feels like every other week I lose the keys to my car.</p> <p>Before then I\u2019d just assumed I was clumsy, although when I thought about it properly, lots of things began to make sense in retrospect. This explained why I often get undressed and see bruises that I\u2019ve no recollection of acquiring; why during childbirth, after some serious pushing I felt nothing more than a considerable stretch. It\u2019s why the only way I know if I\u2019ve burned myself while cooking is when the aroma of meat reaches my nostrils. I\u2019m a vegan, so what I\u2019m smelling is actually my own scorched flesh.</p> <p>There was even the time we went on a backpacking holiday in eastern Europe. On the first morning I fell over and went head first into a huge concrete slab. I lost my front teeth and gained a black eye \u2013 there were cuts all over my face. The family thought we\u2019d go home, but I just whacked on my sunglasses, wrapped a scarf around my mouth, made a rule there would be no pictures of me and we carried on. They all must have just thought I was trying to be strong for them as a mum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57f565c360645ae164195c67b44c78b9f860f8cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57f565c360645ae164195c67b44c78b9f860f8cd/0_163_1774_2216/801.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I have an abundance of anandamide in my body, so much that I never experience anxiety, fear or pain.\u2019\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I have an abundance of anandamide in my body, so much that I never experience anxiety, fear or pain.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Lucas Varela/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My happy gene also makes me incredibly positive: I\u2019m wired to look on the bright side of life. I may not feel pain, but I see it on the faces of people around me, on television. And when something sad happens in my life, of course it affects me, it\u2019s just that the sadness doesn\u2019t consume all I do. A few minutes later I\u2019m thinking practically, whirring into action.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m complacent. I\u2019m outraged by injustice and can empathise with those having a tough time. But I\u2019m practical. Vote! Protest! Do something! But don\u2019t be a worrier, on leaving Europe or climate change or anything, really. My attitude is why waste time being a nervous wreck?</p> <p>I\u2019m pretty certain my father had the same condition, although he\u2019s no longer with us, so it\u2019s impossible to be sure. He never complained about his war wound, and was very open-minded. There was no curfew in the evenings or restrictions on outings with boys. This British Army major would even skip alongside me on the way to school. When a brain haemorrhage killed him \u2013 without a word of warning \u2013 he just dropped down dead where he was stood.</p> <p>Once my test results were back, I told the research team that, of course, I\u2019d help them. I\u2019m no neuroscientist, but if they can isolate this gene and reproduce it to help suppress pain in others, the scientists hope to develop a natural form of pain relief. It makes me so pleased to think what the impact of that on other people might be. What\u2019s inside me might be the secret to alleviating the suffering of others, an alternative to often addictive drugs. The funding has come through \u2013 the next phase begins in 2020.</p> <p>At first, the research team thought I was the only person in the world like me, but since my story went public, 80 people from across the globe have come forward to say they think they\u2019re the same. Their bloods are being tested right now, and I\u2019m hoping they\u2019re correct. I\u2019m 72 now, and it\u2019s already taken us seven years to get this far. This could take decades. I might be an optimist, but I\u2019m realistic \u2013 at some point they\u2019re going to need some younger volunteers.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m the fastest human calculator\u2019: <em>Scott Flansburg, 55, Scottsdale, Arizona, America</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4ec780a9305a606a3f53b03cdf0aa7ec9cf3b135\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ec780a9305a606a3f53b03cdf0aa7ec9cf3b135/340_5_2488_1493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Say a number, any number\u2026\u2019 Scott Flansburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Say a number, any number\u2019: Scott Flansburg</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Flansburg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pick a date, any day in your life, and I can tell you what day of the week it was. Say a number, any number, and I can multiply it all day. I\u2019m a Guinness World Record holder \u2013 the fastest human calculator. I\u2019ve held the title for more than 20 years.</p> <p>I was just a regular nine-year-old pupil when my teacher wrote a list of two-digit numbers for the class to add together. My teacher could tell I wasn\u2019t paying attention as she explained how numbers are carried over, so she decided to make an example of me by picking me out and sending me up to the board. The standard way to find the total of lots of numbers is to line them up and work downwards right to left, if you can remember. But I assumed that you could do it in the same way you read a sentence \u2013 from left to right \u2013 and found I could.</p> <p>By the age of 10, my maths teachers were letting me come up with ideas rather than trying to teach me. I could see all these patterns and started discovering methods of multiplication that worked.</p> <p>In the end I dropped out of high school. I never made it to college \u2013 I signed up to the Air Force instead. I served four years in Japan, and two in America. Then, in 1988, when my military supervisor\u2019s son was struggling in school with maths, I was drafted in to help. I spent an evening showing the child some tricks and shortcuts, giving him a hand.</p> <p>The next morning I got a call from his teacher: \u201cWho are you,\u201d they asked me, \u201cand what have you done?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I've had an MRI scan, the doctor said he'd never seen a brain like mine</p> <footer> <cite>Scott Flansburg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From then, things escalated pretty quickly. I started to speak to classes fairly often, and after a reporter saw my mathematical skills firsthand and filed a story, I was invited on to television \u2013 I did the rounds.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had an MRI scan. The doctor said he\u2019d never seen a brain like mine. It\u2019s almost as if it has a different set of wires. There\u2019s a part of the brain called Brodmann area 44, or BA44, and mine is naturally four times the normal size. I\u2019ve met a few other people with similar abilities at competitions: Yusnier Viera, Gerald Newport and Lee Jeonghee.</p> <p>For me it\u2019s all about arithmetic, sums and numbers. I never went on to study higher level maths. I spend my life working to inspire kids to engage in the subject at that basic level, the point at which so many disconnect. That\u2019s also how I keep myself interested \u2013 for me there\u2019s no mental challenge in the arithmetic everyone else has to think hard for; it\u2019s all about thinking of new and exciting educational ideas.</p> <p>My skills used to be useful for companies. Investors, for instance, would want me to look for patterns in their trades. But since the advent of the super computer I\u2019m a little less helpful to them. I\u2019d have been more useful, I think, if I\u2019d been born hundreds or even thousands of years ago.</p> <p>My next big thing is to get the rest of the world to use the calendar I\u2019ve invented. I\u2019m all about efficiency, and right now the way we measure time is a mess. Sure, we have no control over the fact there are 365 days in a year, but there\u2019s simply no way to make that divide neatly into 12. Forget October, November and December \u2013 if you ask me, there should be 13 months in a year, each lasting 28 days, plus a zero day to kick each year off. I\u2019m going to try and convince the world to try it out in 2023, the next time my calendar matches up with yours.</p> <h2>\u2018I can play any piece of music I\u2019ve ever heard\u2019: <em>Derek Paravicini, 40, London</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ff59b382e4ec90bf7f24523bc409f350f2ded220\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff59b382e4ec90bf7f24523bc409f350f2ded220/58_447_2576_3219/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Being blind, I\u2019d never even seen anyone play the piano, but I could copy tunes note for note\u2019: Derek Paravicini.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Being blind, I\u2019d never even seen anyone play the piano, but I could copy tunes note for note\u2019: Derek Paravicini.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marios K Forsos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like most children, I spent my early years surrounded by music. I\u2019ve always been blind. I was born extremely prematurely, so it is through sound that I experience the world. I had a nanny who looked after me and she tried everything she could think of to interest me. Then one day, when I was 18 months old, she had a brainwave, and retrieved a toy organ from the loft that someone had once bought in Woolworths.</p> <p>Of course, I don\u2019t remember, but what my family found I could do with it was amazing. Without any help from anyone, I could play the music I\u2019d heard, from Cockles and Mussels to the hymns that my family sang in church.

From then on it\u2019s every conversation, every day out, every celebration. It\u2019s mostly entirely useless, though \u2013 like what I had for breakfast, or the most mundane of thoughts. All these memories are in chronological order, so I can work backwards or forwards. If I go back to the days before I really understood calendars, I use the image of my birthday cake and its number of candles as a reference to start. I even remember dreams \u2013 those from the first 20 minutes of sleeping. When I had my first at eight months it was quite a shock.</p> <p>I\u2019ll be honest, it does get annoying. I get headaches and it causes anxiety; I have to listen to music every night as I fall asleep or else I\u2019m constantly having random flashbacks. For a long time I saw it as a curse. Slowly, as I\u2019ve grown a little older, I\u2019ve come to appreciate what my brain gives me. I can memorise lines, which is great for public speaking. That\u2019s what I want to make my career, sharing my experiences with people across the world. While the sentence structures of foreign languages take some getting used to \u2013 I\u2019ve been learning a few so I can travel \u2013 the words all just stick right away.</p> <p>Soon I want to put my life down on paper, the moments \u2013 big or small \u2013 that hold significance. I hope to look at how each affected my life and my future in a way few people can. And I\u2019m starting a business, a support group for other people with autism to overcome obstacles and find their passion.</p> <p>Nobody is quite sure how my brain can actually hold all this information. It\u2019s why medical researchers from Queensland to California are so keen to poke around up there. They\u2019re attempting to discover which part of the brain is responsible for long-term memory, in the hope of finding ways to help those who are affected by Alzheimer\u2019s, brain damage or strokes. I spend a lot of time having my brain scanned. In the initial tests I was asked to work out which day of the week random dates had been throughout my life. I\u2019d be asked random questions and then to recall my answers five months later.</p> <p>I\u2019ve spent 90 minutes in an MRI scanner that showed how the conscious and subconscious parts of my mind are more strongly connected than usual. Now they know what my brain can do, they\u2019re more interested in studying its biology. The scientists have already discovered that the memories of people with HSAM usually get clearer with the passage of time, which is the opposite to how most people experience them.</p> <p>My stepdad\u2019s father passed away a few years ago. He had suffered with Alzheimer\u2019s, and seeing him go through it all spurred me on to do all I can to help find a cure. I like to joke that people like me are human lab rats, although we\u2019re human lab rats who are very well cared for and loved.</p> <p>When I\u2019m bored, I sometimes take myself back to a time when I worried about everything and anxiety crippled me. I think about what the 14-year-old me wished for her future, and it makes me truly appreciate the small things I now take for granted \u2013 the things I\u2019ve achieved that might otherwise seem mundane. I think about what I thought my life might look like \u2013 and I\u2019m proud of just how far I\u2019ve come.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I\u2019ve never felt physical pain\u2019: Jo Cameron, 72, Whitebridge, Scotland I can understand why it took so long for anyone to notice. It makes sense that the quiet, happy person in the corner gets ignored. It was only when I was in hospital for an operation on my arthritic hand \u2013 aged 65 \u2013 that the fact I can\u2019t feel pain finally came to light. I\u2019d only recently had a long-overdue hip replacement. \u201cThis will hurt more than the last one, you\u2019ll need more painkillers,\u201d the hospital anaesthetist had told me. I offered to bet any money it wouldn\u2019t when I looked up at him with a smile. He came to see me after the procedure and I wiggled my hand in his face, proudly. \u201cNo painkillers,\u201d I said, grinning, \u201cand no pain either.\u201d Down in London, I went for tests at University College Hospital. In the experiments, my husband was used as the standard \u2013 they even took a biopsy from his leg. The researchers found an abundance of a substance called anandamide in my body \u2013 so much that I never experience anxiety, fear or pain. Instead, my genes make me happy and forgetful \u2013 finally, an explanation for why it feels like every other week I lose the keys to my car. Before then I\u2019d just assumed I was clumsy, although when I thought about it properly, lots of things began to make sense in retrospect. This explained why I often get undressed and see bruises that I\u2019ve no recollection of acquiring; why during childbirth, after some serious pushing I felt nothing more than a considerable stretch. It\u2019s why the only way I know if I\u2019ve burned myself while cooking is when the aroma of meat reaches my nostrils. I\u2019m a vegan, so what I\u2019m smelling is actually my own scorched flesh. There was even the time we went on a backpacking holiday in eastern Europe. On the first morning I fell over and went head first into a huge concrete slab. I lost my front teeth and gained a black eye \u2013 there were cuts all over my face. The family thought we\u2019d go home, but I just whacked on my sunglasses, wrapped a scarf around my mouth, made a rule there would be no pictures of me and we carried on. They all must have just thought I was trying to be strong for them as a mum. My happy gene also makes me incredibly positive: I\u2019m wired to look on the bright side of life. I may not feel pain, but I see it on the faces of people around me, on television. And when something sad happens in my life, of course it affects me, it\u2019s just that the sadness doesn\u2019t consume all I do. A few minutes later I\u2019m thinking practically, whirring into action. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m complacent. I\u2019m outraged by injustice and can empathise with those having a tough time. But I\u2019m practical. Vote! Protest! Do something! But don\u2019t be a worrier, on leaving Europe or climate change or anything, really. My attitude is why waste time being a nervous wreck? I\u2019m pretty certain my father had the same condition, although he\u2019s no longer with us, so it\u2019s impossible to be sure. He never complained about his war wound, and was very open-minded. There was no curfew in the evenings or restrictions on outings with boys. This British Army major would even skip alongside me on the way to school. When a brain haemorrhage killed him \u2013 without a word of warning \u2013 he just dropped down dead where he was stood. Once my test results were back, I told the research team that, of course, I\u2019d help them. I\u2019m no neuroscientist, but if they can isolate this gene and reproduce it to help suppress pain in others, the scientists hope to develop a natural form of pain relief. It makes me so pleased to think what the impact of that on other people might be. What\u2019s inside me might be the secret to alleviating the suffering of others, an alternative to often addictive drugs. The funding has come through \u2013 the next phase begins in 2020. At first, the research team thought I was the only person in the world like me, but since my story went public, 80 people from across the globe have come forward to say they think they\u2019re the same. Their bloods are being tested right now, and I\u2019m hoping they\u2019re correct. I\u2019m 72 now, and it\u2019s already taken us seven years to get this far. This could take decades. I might be an optimist, but I\u2019m realistic \u2013 at some point they\u2019re going to need some younger volunteers. \u2018I\u2019m the fastest human calculator\u2019: Scott Flansburg, 55, Scottsdale, Arizona, America Pick a date, any day in your life, and I can tell you what day of the week it was. Say a number, any number, and I can multiply it all day. I\u2019m a Guinness World Record holder \u2013 the fastest human calculator. I\u2019ve held the title for more than 20 years. I was just a regular nine-year-old pupil when my teacher wrote a list of two-digit numbers for the class to add together. My teacher could tell I wasn\u2019t paying attention as she explained how numbers are carried over, so she decided to make an example of me by picking me out and sending me up to the board. The standard way to find the total of lots of numbers is to line them up and work downwards right to left, if you can remember. But I assumed that you could do it in the same way you read a sentence \u2013 from left to right \u2013 and found I could. By the age of 10, my maths teachers were letting me come up with ideas rather than trying to teach me. I could see all these patterns and started discovering methods of multiplication that worked. In the end I dropped out of high school. I never made it to college \u2013 I signed up to the Air Force instead. I served four years in Japan, and two in America. Then, in 1988, when my military supervisor\u2019s son was struggling in school with maths, I was drafted in to help. I spent an evening showing the child some tricks and shortcuts, giving him a hand. The next morning I got a call from his teacher: \u201cWho are you,\u201d they asked me, \u201cand what have you done?\u201d From then, things escalated pretty quickly. I started to speak to classes fairly often, and after a reporter saw my mathematical skills firsthand and filed a story, I was invited on to television \u2013 I did the rounds. I\u2019ve had an MRI scan. The doctor said he\u2019d never seen a brain like mine. It\u2019s almost as if it has a different set of wires. There\u2019s a part of the brain called Brodmann area 44, or BA44, and mine is naturally four times the normal size. I\u2019ve met a few other people with similar abilities at competitions: Yusnier Viera, Gerald Newport and Lee Jeonghee. For me it\u2019s all about arithmetic, sums and numbers. I never went on to study higher level maths. I spend my life working to inspire kids to engage in the subject at that basic level, the point at which so many disconnect. That\u2019s also how I keep myself interested \u2013 for me there\u2019s no mental challenge in the arithmetic everyone else has to think hard for; it\u2019s all about thinking of new and exciting educational ideas. My skills used to be useful for companies. Investors, for instance, would want me to look for patterns in their trades. But since the advent of the super computer I\u2019m a little less helpful to them. I\u2019d have been more useful, I think, if I\u2019d been born hundreds or even thousands of years ago. My next big thing is to get the rest of the world to use the calendar I\u2019ve invented. I\u2019m all about efficiency, and right now the way we measure time is a mess. Sure, we have no control over the fact there are 365 days in a year, but there\u2019s simply no way to make that divide neatly into 12. Forget October, November and December \u2013 if you ask me, there should be 13 months in a year, each lasting 28 days, plus a zero day to kick each year off. I\u2019m going to try and convince the world to try it out in 2023, the next time my calendar matches up with yours. \u2018I can play any piece of music I\u2019ve ever heard\u2019: Derek Paravicini, 40, London Like most children, I spent my early years surrounded by music. I\u2019ve always been blind. I was born extremely prematurely, so it is through sound that I experience the world. I had a nanny who looked after me and she tried everything she could think of to interest me. Then one day, when I was 18 months old, she had a brainwave, and retrieved a toy organ from the loft that someone had once bought in Woolworths. Of course, I don\u2019t remember, but what my family found I could do with it was amazing. Without any help from anyone, I could play the music I\u2019d heard, from Cockles and Mussels to the hymns that my family sang in church. Being blind, I\u2019d never even seen anyone play the piano, but I could copy these tunes \u2013 and their accompaniments \u2013 note for note. It became obvious pretty quickly that my musical brain was wired up in an extraordinary way and, once my parents purchased a piano, I\u2019d use everything, from my hands to my head and my elbows, to play what I could hear in my head. They soon realised that my fingers would need help to catch up. Aged four, at a school for the blind in south London called Linden Lodge, I met Adam Ockelford, who was the music teacher there, and he decided to take me under his wing. He started out by teaching me at home. He tells me I didn\u2019t take kindly to being told what to do. I\u2019d push him out the way and so he\u2019d pick me up and place me in the corner of the children\u2019s room where we practised. He\u2019d play a tune while I found my way back to the piano and then I\u2019d repeat what I\u2019d heard, just like that. I loved practising and worked really hard, every day before breakfast and in the evenings. I first appeared on TV when I was only eight, in 1987, on the Derek Jameson Show. The next year, I hit the big time, playing the Pink Panther for Terry Wogan on UK national television, with an audience of millions. Suddenly, media from all over the world were interested. As a teenager I\u2019d often get frustrated and angry, and furniture would fly. But Adam helped me channel all those emotions through music and we would improvise together for hours.

And there doesn\u2019t seem to be a limit on what I can learn. I memorised a full piano concerto with 11,000 notes just by listening, and played it with orchestras on the South Bank in London and in the Mainly Mozart Festival in San Diego, California. In fact, I do lots of concerts, from schools to some of the world\u2019s great concert halls and arenas \u2013 from Taiwan to Las Vegas. I love to entertain people \u2013 the bigger the audience the more I like it. And I\u2019ve never been nervous when I perform. I just know I can do it. People are mystified, because part of the show is when I ask the audience for requests. They can choose anything they like.

I even remember dreams \u2013 those from the first 20 minutes of sleeping. When I had my first at eight months it was quite a shock. I\u2019ll be honest, it does get annoying. I get headaches and it causes anxiety; I have to listen to music every night as I fall asleep or else I\u2019m constantly having random flashbacks. For a long time I saw it as a curse. Slowly, as I\u2019ve grown a little older, I\u2019ve come to appreciate what my brain gives me. I can memorise lines, which is great for public speaking. That\u2019s what I want to make my career, sharing my experiences with people across the world. While the sentence structures of foreign languages take some getting used to \u2013 I\u2019ve been learning a few so I can travel \u2013 the words all just stick right away. Soon I want to put my life down on paper, the moments \u2013 big or small \u2013 that hold significance. I hope to look at how each affected my life and my future in a way few people can. And I\u2019m starting a business, a support group for other people with autism to overcome obstacles and find their passion. Nobody is quite sure how my brain can actually hold all this information. It\u2019s why medical researchers from Queensland to California are so keen to poke around up there. They\u2019re attempting to discover which part of the brain is responsible for long-term memory, in the hope of finding ways to help those who are affected by Alzheimer\u2019s, brain damage or strokes. I spend a lot of time having my brain scanned. In the initial tests I was asked to work out which day of the week random dates had been throughout my life. I\u2019d be asked random questions and then to recall my answers five months later. I\u2019ve spent 90 minutes in an MRI scanner that showed how the conscious and subconscious parts of my mind are more strongly connected than usual. Now they know what my brain can do, they\u2019re more interested in studying its biology. The scientists have already discovered that the memories of people with HSAM usually get clearer with the passage of time, which is the opposite to how most people experience them. My stepdad\u2019s father passed away a few years ago. He had suffered with Alzheimer\u2019s, and seeing him go through it all spurred me on to do all I can to help find a cure. I like to joke that people like me are human lab rats, although we\u2019re human lab rats who are very well cared for and loved. When I\u2019m bored, I sometimes take myself back to a time when I worried about everything and anxiety crippled me. I think about what the 14-year-old me wished for her future, and it makes me truly appreciate the small things I now take for granted \u2013 the things I\u2019ve achieved that might otherwise seem mundane. I think about what I thought my life might look like \u2013 and I\u2019m proud of just how far I\u2019ve come. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Transport policy for the next 50 years was entirely oriented towards the facilitation of the movement of cars. Cycling was wiped out and pedestrians were mown down in their hundreds. Obstructing the highway became a criminal offence. Planners designed town centres around the car, incorporating ring roads and urban motorways,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a turning point in the 1970s, when the newly formed Greater London council killed off a proposal for a motorway ring road inside London. We started to see bus lanes, traffic wardens, 20mph zones and the congestion charge in London. Now there is a zeitgeist around climate change and healthier living. We\u2019re winning some battles and losing others. But the war is still going on,\u201d Wolmar said.</p> <p>The battles may be helped by a generational shift in attitudes. \u201cThere are studies which show that millennials and Generation Z have shifted away from car use and car ownership, to the extent that some don\u2019t bother getting a driving licence,\u201d said Schwanen. Heley, the Green party Brighton councillor, said her peer group did not rely on cars: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford them.\u201d</p> <p>Some say that future generations will find it incomprehensible that individuals were once permitted to drive private cars into urban centres at will, just as today\u2019s young people are horrified that their parents could once smoke cigarettes on planes and in cinemas and restaurants.</p> <p>But the issues are \u201ccombustible\u201d, according to Schwanen: \u201cI often tell local politicians: if you want to kill your career, reduce parking. Transport is politically charged \u2013 and while we are seeing an acceleration in plans and proposals, it will be even more interesting to see what actually gets implemented.\u201d</p> <p>Developing such plans in a fast-changing society is challenging.

Motorists would still be able to drive into the city, but would be prevented from crossing the city in a move to tackle air pollution and prioritise cycling, walking and public transport. Other measures include introducing car-sharing and 20mph limit in the city centre. The council has said that road transport accounts for a third of CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions in Birmingham.</p> <p><strong>York</strong></p> <p>The historic city aims to ban all non-essential private car journeys inside its medieval walls within three years to cut carbon emissions. Disabled drivers would be exempt. Many streets around the minster, above, are already pedestrianised. The city, which attracts almost 7 million tourists each year, aims to become carbon neutral by 2030.</p> <p><strong>Edinburgh</strong></p> <p>The Scottish capital is in the midst of an 18-month trial during which city centre streets are closed to traffic for several hours on the first Sunday of every month. It was the first UK city to join the Open Streets initiative to combat air pollution and reclaim city centres for pedestrians and cyclists.</p> <p><strong>Bristol</strong></p> <p>The city will become the first in the UK to ban privately owned diesel cars from its streets next year. It will prohibit such vehicles from entering a central zone from 7am until 3pm, or incur a fine. Taxis and emergency services will be exempt, and commercial vehicles will have to pay to enter the area.</p> <p><strong>Oxford</strong></p> <p>The city and county councils have proposed the UK\u2019s first zero emission zone in the city centre. Drivers of diesel and petrol vehicles will be charged \u00a310 a day to enter the zone, increasing to \u00a320 in December 2024. The penalty for not paying the charge will be \u00a3120. People living inside the zone will pay a discounted rate of 10%.</p> <p><strong>Glasgow</strong></p> <p>The city council has proposed limiting private vehicle access to George Square. Under the plans to be debated this week, two sides of the famous city centre plaza would be pedestrianised, and the other two restricted to public transport and cyclists.</p> <p><strong>Manchester</strong></p> <p>Mayor Andy Burnham and cycling and walking commissioner Chris Boardman have launched a five-year plan to increase daily walking trips by a third and \u201cdouble and double again\u201d cycling journeys by 2025. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about switching from cars to bikes and cutting harmful emissions \u2013 it\u2019s also about what we want our towns and cities to look like, and how we look after our public spaces,\u201d Burnham said last week.</p> <p><strong>Portsmouth</strong></p> <p>Plans have been unveiled for the UK\u2019s first car-free community. Planning permission has been sought for a new neighbourhood of 4,000 homes on the eastern side of Portsmouth harbour, with streets dedicated to pedestrians and cyclists, and vehicles confined to a vast underground car park. Portsmouth city council, which is backing the development, said it could be a \u201cbeacon for the whole of Portsmouth and the rest of the country\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Cardiff</strong></p> <p>The city is planning to charge non-residents \u00a32 to drive into the centre as part of \u00a32bn \u201ctransport vision\u201d to reduce congestion and improve air quality. Other measures include new tram/train routes, new park-and-ride sites, cheaper bus fares, more walking and cycling routes and an electric bike pilot scheme.</p> <p><strong>London</strong></p> <p>The capital pioneered the congestion charge in 2003 and it is now one of the largest in the world. In 2019 it introduced the 24-hour ultra-low emission zone, which will expand to cover all of Greater London next year. More than 27km of roads were closed on its annual car-free day last year. Mayor Sadiq Khan has said he wants 80% of all journeys in the capital to be made by walking, cycling or public transport by 2041, compared with 63% now.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Conservatives and culture warriors in Brazil have expressed delight after one of the country\u2019s most celebrated research institutes announced plans to host a Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan week later this year. But critics view the event as yet another attempt by the government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro to impose conservative and Christian influences on the country\u2019s top academic and cultural institutions. In May, the Rui Barbosa House Foundation \u2013 a research centre that receives government funding \u2013 will host a string of exhibitions and lectures about the rightwing 1980s icons. Let\u00edcia Dornelles, a former journalist and telenovela writer, who was chosen to head the foundation in October last year, said the events \u201cwill provide an overview\u201d of Thatcher and Reagan\u2019s \u201cinfluences on current conservative world leaders\u201d. \u201cThatcher and Reagan are idols of many Brazilians and current politicians,\u201d she said. The initiative is in partnership with Brazil\u2019s foreign office, which has swung to the right under Bolsonaro, forming close ties with conservative leaders such Donald Trump and Victor Orb\u00e1n. The foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo \u2013 who believes climate change is a Marxist plot \u2013 will participate. Admiration for Thatcher and Reagan runs deep within the Bolsonaro government. In a speech in the White House gardens last year, Bolsonaro quoted Reagan and said he was a \u201cgreat admirer\u201d of the former president and B-movie star. The economy minister, Paulo Guedes, trained in free market fundamentals at the Chicago School of Economics \u2013 the seedbed for Reagan and Thatcher\u2019s economic policies \u2013 and worked at the University of Chile during Augusto Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship in the 1980s. In an interview with the Financial Times last year, he described Chile\u2019s neoliberal reforms as \u201ca wonderful transformation\u201d, and added: \u201cThatcher, Reagan, they understood that.\u201d Bolsonaro\u2019s politician sons meanwhile have been photographed with Thatcher and Reagan memorabilia such as T-shirts, coffee mugs and model figures. Charles Gomes, a legal scholar and senior researcher with a focus on migration at Rui Barbosa House, cast doubt on the Thatcher and Reagan week\u2019s academic value. \u201cThe event isn\u2019t based on anyone\u2019s academic work, it appears to be pure propaganda,\u201d he said. Critics have accused Bolsonaro\u2019s government of \u201cideological interference\u201d in several sectors \u2013 often to their detriment \u2013 from arts and education to foreign and indigenous policy. Bolsonaro\u2019s son Carlos was one of the first public figures to show support for Thatcher and Reagan week, along with former volleyball player turned conservative activist Ana Paula Henkel. The former culture secretary Roberto Alvim also publicly endorsed the event \u2013 before he was fired earlier this month after paraphrasing the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Regina Duarte, an actress best known for her roles in Brazilian telenovelas and her outspoken opposition to Brazil\u2019s leftist Workers\u2019 party, is tipped to takeover.",

      "body": "<p>There is much to admire in Lucy Kirkwood\u2019s new play, <strong><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-welkin\" title=\"\">The Welkin</a></strong>, set in 18th-century Suffolk. It is filled with shocks of the best and worst sort, light and dark entertainment. Director James Macdonald, designer Bunny Christie and lighting designer Lee Curran have conspired to produce a show of elegance and force, and the opening is a coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre. After we read the word \u201cHousework\u201d \u2013 as though this were as much a book as a play \u2013 the curtain goes up on a dazzling double storey of women working, each occupying her own bright frame: ironing, beating the dust out of a rug, stitching a seam by candlelight. It\u2019s a marvellous living cabinet of chores. It is also a revelatory novelty to be watching an ensemble piece with a huge female cast \u2013 13 women to two men. There is, later, a great sense of space and depth in the room where the action \u2013 and inaction \u2013 takes place, with a classical mantelpiece, a malfunctioning fireplace and not much furniture (women are the furniture) surrounded by what it is fair to describe as Farrow &amp; Ball walls.</p> <p>A jury of matrons has convened to determine (as they historically did) whether Sally Poppy, who has been found guilty of murdering an 11-year-old girl, is pregnant (if so, she will avoid the hangman). And might she also be innocent? Watching the interactions between the women, their frustration at trying to arrive at a unanimous verdict, is absorbing and the cast top notch and divertingly varied. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/apr/21/maxine-peake-interview-avalanche-play-ivf-barbican\" title=\"\">Maxine Peake</a> compels as Elizabeth Luke, the midwife with an urgent personal agenda. Cecilia Noble has the audience eating out of her hand as Emma Jenkins, the prudish matriarch whose stifled laugh of disapproval brings the house down, while the accused is played with unsettling skill by Ria Zmitrowicz \u2013 her desperate lot has not extinguished her ragamuffin lust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27f10bce72bf6f1ca7dd8660741b0dcbdca7e1bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27f10bce72bf6f1ca7dd8660741b0dcbdca7e1bf/0_0_5822_3977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cecilia Noble, left, and Haydn Gwynne in The Welkin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cecilia Noble, left, and Haydn Gwynne in The Welkin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brinkhoff-Moegenburg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, for all its quality, the evening left me tantalised and disturbed (and not in the way intended). One explanation might be that Kirkwood\u2019s talented pen runs off with the play. Colourful, entertaining tangents are partly what make her the writer she is, but in this three-hour show, and particularly at its hideously violent moments (which I\u2019ll not give away), she undermines her purpose, plays fast and loose with our emotions. Too often (listen to Noble\u2019s speech about murdering a dog), she is not as decided as she needs to be about whether she is asking her audience to laugh, cringe or cry.</p> <p>A tremendous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/07/samuel-beckett-trevor-nunn-theatre-play-shameless-david-threlfall-west-end\" title=\"\">Beckett triple bill</a> \u2013 <strong><a href=\"https://www.jermynstreettheatre.co.uk/show/beckett-triple-bill/\" title=\"\">Krapp\u2019s Last Tape, Eh</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.jermynstreettheatre.co.uk/show/beckett-triple-bill/\" title=\"\"> Jo and The Old Tune</a></strong> \u2013 is playing in Jermyn Street, unerringly directed by Trevor Nunn. These little masterpieces are about old age as a memory test and the ways memory tests us. It is Beckett\u2019s tormenting peripheral vision that counts. In <em>Krapp\u2019s Last Tape</em>, a girl in a shabby green coat is briefly seen on a railway station platform; in <em>Eh</em><em> Joe</em>, another girl, in lilac slip, wades \u2013 fatally we suppose \u2013 into a lake. The elegiac is used as a cudgel. Even in <em>The Old Tune</em>, the most entertaining piece in the trio (a warm-up for <em>Waiting for Godot</em>), two old gents on a bench find their ability to gossip dogged by their failure to remember or agree. Their past is seen in contested glimpses.</p> <p>James Hayes gives us a recital of <em>Krapp\u2019s Last Tape</em> so compelling that it seemed no one in this tiny theatre dared breathe \u2013 you could hear the whizzing tapes of his antediluvian tape recorder. He plays a recording (\u201cBox 3, Spool 5\u201d) made decades ago, an irregular and possibly tragic audio diary. Who knows what he is listening for? The play is a dark tease, and Hayes has us watching him like a hawk to gauge his reactions to what he hears: he fidgets and winces and faffs with the recorder and joins in with the mirthless laughter of his younger self. His concentration reinforces ours. Desolation and absurdity combine. \u201cSpooool,\u201d he says, unspooling the vowel, as though the word were a toy. You start to see how the details of the triste tryst of his youth only render it more mysterious. This is an outstanding performance and a tribute to Hayes that I never knew a Beckett play seem so short.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dba52f13d8069543cc2f5eee065a044f828d57fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dba52f13d8069543cc2f5eee065a044f828d57fa/0_0_4175_2830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Hayes in Krapp\u2019s Last Tape.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breathtaking\u2026 James Hayes in Krapp\u2019s Last Tape.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Eh</em><em> Joe</em> is a different skirmish with memory in which the recorded voice of incomparable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/31/lisa-dwan-samuel-beckett-not-i-interview\" title=\"\">Beckett supremo Lisa Dwan</a> haunts Joe, who sits in a bedroom with tears in his eyes. Dwan uses her voice as a terrible, crackling caress. It blows in like high wind \u2013 husky reminiscence quickening into viciousness. Niall Buggy\u2019s listening, alone yet taunted by the woman, reminds us that it is possible to give a great performance without saying a word.</p> <p>Buggy\u2019s voice is restored to him in <em>The Old Tune</em> and, as Gorman, he is warm, vulnerable and touching. Two old men congratulate each other on their sense of humour. They deliver wonderful, shorthand lines: \u201cAh yes, children \u2013 that\u2019s the way it is\u201d and are sorry that cigarettes \u2013 \u201cgaspers\u201d \u2013 are not what they were. Traffic noise interrupts their conversation. Gorman\u2019s old acquaintance, Cream, is irresistibly played by David Threlfall, who looks like an indignant Irish sea captain (watch his left eyebrow at work). And although their reference to \u201cthe wisdom of the ancients\u201d is ironic, this double masterclass in acting offers wisdom in abundance.</p> <p>The new <a href=\"https://boulevardtheatre.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Boulevard theatre</a> in Soho is a chic, lively addition to London\u2019s theatre scene. But the gulf between the venue\u2019s feelgood eatery and what is on its stage borders on the comic. Watching <strong><a href=\"https://boulevardtheatre.co.uk/whats-on/the-sunset-limited/\" title=\"\">The Sunset Limited</a></strong>, I kept thinking of Turgenev\u2019s joke in <em>Fathers and Sons</em>: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a nihilist for nothing.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/cormac-mccarthy\" title=\"\">Cormac McCarthy</a> is one of the giants of American literature (<em>All The Pretty Horses</em>, <em>No Country for Old Men</em>, <em>The Road</em>) and a magnificently desolating novelist. But he is not a natural playwright. Although influenced by Beckett, he lacks Beckett\u2019s humour and the sorrow that depends on the hunch that love exists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e860c0ef612d5df01c0f37134879f599bec33905\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e860c0ef612d5df01c0f37134879f599bec33905/38_549_4357_2613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Beadle, left, and Jasper Britton in The Sunset Limited.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Eloquently depressing\u2019: Gary Beadle, left, and Jasper Britton in The Sunset Limited.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is an encounter, capably directed by Terry Johnson, between White, a charmless, wiped-out professor (played with understandable resignation by Jasper Britton) who has been rescued from throwing himself under a train by Black, an ex-con, now Bible-basher (flawlessly natural <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/20/gary-beadle-curse-of-eastenders-won\" title=\"\">Gary Beadle</a>).

Cecilia Noble has the audience eating out of her hand as Emma Jenkins, the prudish matriarch whose stifled laugh of disapproval brings the house down, while the accused is played with unsettling skill by Ria Zmitrowicz \u2013 her desperate lot has not extinguished her ragamuffin lust. However, for all its quality, the evening left me tantalised and disturbed (and not in the way intended). One explanation might be that Kirkwood\u2019s talented pen runs off with the play. Colourful, entertaining tangents are partly what make her the writer she is, but in this three-hour show, and particularly at its hideously violent moments (which I\u2019ll not give away), she undermines her purpose, plays fast and loose with our emotions. Too often (listen to Noble\u2019s speech about murdering a dog), she is not as decided as she needs to be about whether she is asking her audience to laugh, cringe or cry. A tremendous Beckett triple bill \u2013 Krapp\u2019s Last Tape, Eh Jo and The Old Tune \u2013 is playing in Jermyn Street, unerringly directed by Trevor Nunn. These little masterpieces are about old age as a memory test and the ways memory tests us. It is Beckett\u2019s tormenting peripheral vision that counts. In Krapp\u2019s Last Tape, a girl in a shabby green coat is briefly seen on a railway station platform; in Eh Joe, another girl, in lilac slip, wades \u2013 fatally we suppose \u2013 into a lake. The elegiac is used as a cudgel. Even in The Old Tune, the most entertaining piece in the trio (a warm-up for Waiting for Godot), two old gents on a bench find their ability to gossip dogged by their failure to remember or agree. Their past is seen in contested glimpses. James Hayes gives us a recital of Krapp\u2019s Last Tape so compelling that it seemed no one in this tiny theatre dared breathe \u2013 you could hear the whizzing tapes of his antediluvian tape recorder. He plays a recording (\u201cBox 3, Spool 5\u201d) made decades ago, an irregular and possibly tragic audio diary. Who knows what he is listening for? The play is a dark tease, and Hayes has us watching him like a hawk to gauge his reactions to what he hears: he fidgets and winces and faffs with the recorder and joins in with the mirthless laughter of his younger self. His concentration reinforces ours. Desolation and absurdity combine. \u201cSpooool,\u201d he says, unspooling the vowel, as though the word were a toy. You start to see how the details of the triste tryst of his youth only render it more mysterious. This is an outstanding performance and a tribute to Hayes that I never knew a Beckett play seem so short. Eh Joe is a different skirmish with memory in which the recorded voice of incomparable Beckett supremo Lisa Dwan haunts Joe, who sits in a bedroom with tears in his eyes. Dwan uses her voice as a terrible, crackling caress. It blows in like high wind \u2013 husky reminiscence quickening into viciousness. Niall Buggy\u2019s listening, alone yet taunted by the woman, reminds us that it is possible to give a great performance without saying a word. Buggy\u2019s voice is restored to him in The Old Tune and, as Gorman, he is warm, vulnerable and touching. Two old men congratulate each other on their sense of humour. They deliver wonderful, shorthand lines: \u201cAh yes, children \u2013 that\u2019s the way it is\u201d and are sorry that cigarettes \u2013 \u201cgaspers\u201d \u2013 are not what they were. Traffic noise interrupts their conversation. Gorman\u2019s old acquaintance, Cream, is irresistibly played by David Threlfall, who looks like an indignant Irish sea captain (watch his left eyebrow at work). And although their reference to \u201cthe wisdom of the ancients\u201d is ironic, this double masterclass in acting offers wisdom in abundance. The new Boulevard theatre in Soho is a chic, lively addition to London\u2019s theatre scene. But the gulf between the venue\u2019s feelgood eatery and what is on its stage borders on the comic. Watching The Sunset Limited, I kept thinking of Turgenev\u2019s joke in Fathers and Sons: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a nihilist for nothing.\u201d Cormac McCarthy is one of the giants of American literature (All The Pretty Horses, No Country for Old Men, The Road) and a magnificently desolating novelist. But he is not a natural playwright. Although influenced by Beckett, he lacks Beckett\u2019s humour and the sorrow that depends on the hunch that love exists. This is an encounter, capably directed by Terry Johnson, between White, a charmless, wiped-out professor (played with understandable resignation by Jasper Britton) who has been rescued from throwing himself under a train by Black, an ex-con, now Bible-basher (flawlessly natural Gary Beadle). Their eloquently depressing and stalled (might the play work better on radio?) conversation centres on whether life is worth living and whether God is listening. The only hopeful moment, the play\u2019s best, is when Black serves up a stew (\u201cThis is soul food, my man\u201d) and White repeatedly comments as he munches: \u201cThis is really good.\u201d Star ratings (out of five) The Welkin \u2605\u2605\u2605 Krapp\u2019s Last Tape, Eh Joe, The Old Tune \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The Sunset Limited \u2605\u2605 \u2022 The Welkin is the Lyttelton, National Theatre, London, until 23 May \u2022 Beckett Triple Bill is at the Jermyn Street theatre, London, until 8 February \u2022 The Sunset Limited is at the Boulevard theatre, London, until 29 February",

      "body": "<p>Back in 2001, seven years before he directed his first feature film, Steve McQueen made <a href=\"https://www.thomasdanegallery.com/artists/45-steve-mcqueen/works/10424/\" title=\"\">7th Nov</a>, an installation that features in his <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/steve-mcqueen\" title=\"\">forthcoming Tate Modern retrospective</a>. Visually, it is his most minimalist work: a projection of a single still photograph of the crown of a reclining man\u2019s head, which is bisected by a long, curving scar. And yet it possesses a visceral charge that unsettles more than any other piece that will be in the exhibition. That power rests in the accompanying monologue in which McQueen\u2019s cousin, Marcus, recounts in brutally graphic detail the terrible events of the day he accidentally shot and killed his own brother.</p> <p>7th Nov can be seen in retrospect as a signal of what was to come as McQueen made the transition from artist to director, creating acclaimed feature films that merged formal rigour with a narrative style that is often unflinching in its depiction of human endurance.</p> <p>\u201cIt was tough, I can tell you that,\u201d he says, when I ask him about 7th Nov. \u201cI knew what had happened, of course, but when I was sitting in that room recording my cousin, I was hearing the full story for the first time. I mean, I had no idea. No idea.\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head furiously as if trying to erase the memory. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s all about the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. End of. To get to that, you have to go in close, uncover what\u2019s been hidden or covered over. Obviously, the easy thing is not to go there, but I have a need to go there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b72978f5f1be9871bf2185fa7f5e6bc765d6fae5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b72978f5f1be9871bf2185fa7f5e6bc765d6fae5/0_0_2925_1959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"7th Nov, by Steve McQueen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">7th Nov, by Steve McQueen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Steve McQueen. Courtesy the artist, Thomas Dane Gallery and Marian Goodman Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a feature film director, McQueen has made an art out of going there, whether evoking the unyielding nature of Irish republicanism in his debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/31/hunger\" title=\"\">Hunger (2008)</a>, sexual addiction in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/15/shame-steve-mcqueen-fassbender-review\" title=\"\">Shame (2011)</a> or the long nightmare of slavery in the American South in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/12/12-years-a-slave-review\" title=\"\">12 Years a Slave (2013)</a>. In the process, his rapid ascendancy as a filmmaker has all but eclipsed his reputation as an artist. Which is why his imminent retrospective is timely. Through 13 carefully selected pieces, it will trace his creative arc as an artist from 1999, the year he won the Turner prize, to the present day. That means that earlier signature works such as Deadpan (1997), in which he reenacted a famous stunt by silent film star Buster Keaton, and Drumroll (1998), which saw him push a barrel thought the streets of Manhattan, are not in the show.</p> <p>There is one formative film included: Exodus, from 1992, which comprises Super 8 footage he impulsively shot of two elderly black men he spotted carrying potted palms though the streets of east London. It is a low-key metaphorical work that contrasts sharply with the intensity of later works such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blcTlUA1OeE\" title=\"\">Western Deep/Caribs\u2019 Leap</a> (2002), which evokes the long, dark shadow of colonialism, and End Credits (2012),<strong> </strong>in which he uses redacted FBI files to show the extent of surveillance of the black singer and activist Paul Robeson. For those who only know McQueen\u2019s feature films, these non-narrative works may make for a challenging experience.</p> <p>\u201cMany younger people will go to Tate Modern because Steve, the Hollywood director, is an icon for them, but these works certainly require a different level of attentiveness and patience,\u201d says the author and academic Paul Gilroy, who taught McQueen at Goldsmiths in the 1980s and has written one of the catalogue essays. \u201cIt is worth the effort, not least because they offer a wealth of signals and approaches that echo through the later feature films. This is someone who, from the start, had an encyclopaedic knowledge of film and an almost obsessive interest in its history, and that underpins his art practice in often playful and provocative ways.\u201d</p> <p>Across the river, in Tate Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/17/steve-mcqueen-year-3-tate-britain-review-leonardo-experience-a-masterpiece-national-gallery\" title=\"\">McQueen\u2019s epic project, </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/17/steve-mcqueen-year-3-tate-britain-review-leonardo-experience-a-masterpiece-national-gallery\" title=\"\">Year 3</a></em>, on show until May, brings his artistic journey up to date. The ground floor gallery walls are covered floor-to-ceiling with thousands of school portraits that add up to a panoramic vision of contemporary multicultural London. \u201cIt\u2019s been incredible,\u201d he says of the public reaction to <em>Year 3</em> since it opened in November. \u201cPeople have been bringing their grandparents into central London sometimes for the first time to see it. Ordinary people are being seen and seeing themselves on the walls of one of the country\u2019s major art galleries. It\u2019s about recognition, really \u2013 \u2018Look!

In that time, he has gone from being a Turner prize-winning British artist to an internationally acclaimed director, with an Oscar for <em>12 Years a Slave</em> and a couple of Baftas under his belt. In this year\u2019s New Year honours list, he was given a knighthood for services to British film, having already been the recipient of an OBE and a CBE.</p> <p>This extraordinary success may have mellowed him somewhat, but his impatient, coiled-up energy is still evident when we meet over early morning coffee in the almost deserted Tate Modern members\u2019 room. Once or twice during our conversation, he drums impatiently on the table or repeatedly slaps his hand as he searches for the right words to fully convey his meaning \u2013 and the full force of his conviction. When I ask him if his mainstream success as a director means that he now has to make time for his other job as an artist, he looks momentarily offended. \u201cGod no! I don\u2019t think like that at all,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cI mean, \u2018success\u2019? I don\u2019t know what that is. With me, it\u2019s about the work, whatever form it takes. I just want to do the work. Often it\u2019s work that I don\u2019t see being done elsewhere. It\u2019s the dirty work, I suppose. And sometimes I want and welcome that burden.\u201d</p> <p>So, you feel there is a burden to what you do, the burden of truth-telling? \u201cYes. For sure. It\u2019s about putting oneself in places that are not going to be comfortable but, by going there, you might uncover the truth of what is actually going on. Basically, my attitude is: we\u2019re all going to die anyway, so let\u2019s just go for it.\u201d</p> <p>The truth-telling will continue apace later this year when McQueen unveils his short non-narrative film about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\" title=\"\">Grenfell Tower fire</a>, which claimed 72 lives on 14 June 2017. The date and location has yet to be decided and the film is still being edited, so he is reluctant to talk about it in any detail, but when pressed he admits, \u201cIt has been difficult, really difficult in so many ways. Until I was six, I lived less than a mile from there and, even after we moved out to Ealing, I\u2019d go back there to hang around Ladbroke Grove because that\u2019s where everyone I knew would hang out. So, going back there again in the circumstance was heavy, very heavy.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You want to cause a bit of trouble, stir things up. We\u2019re all a bit numb right now. Wake up!</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Self-funded by McQueen, <a href=\"http://www.grenfelltower.memorial/\">the Grenfell project</a> is not a commercial work and will never be broadcast or shown on television, instead eventually being housed in a London space with free admission so that it is accessible to all. He describes it as \u201can artwork that is about keeping the tragedy in the collective consciousness\u201d.</p> <p>With the proviso that it would not be shown for two years, McQueen was granted permission by the local community to film the scorched shell of Grenfell Tower from a helicopter, before it was covered up with plastic sheeting. \u201cIt was very raw, but also very necessary,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was not about being commissioned, it was about getting permission. Initially, it was the permission to talk to the people there, to tell them who I am and where I come from \u2013 I actually used to work on a stall in Ladbroke Grove under the Westway selling secondhand clothes. It was essentially about getting their trust.\u201d</p> <p>He pauses for a long moment. \u201cThat building was like a skull after the fire,\u201d he says, finally. \u201cThen, as soon as they covered it up, it was almost like they were saying it never happened. So, no matter that some people might not want to deal with what happened there, I\u2019m saying, no, no. Let\u2019s not forget.\u201d</p> <p>Death looms like a dark shadow throughout the Tate Modern retrospective, not just in <em>7th Nov</em>, but also the elegiac <em>Ashes</em> (2002-15), which like <em>Carib\u2019s Leap</em> is set in Grenada, where his father was born. It is a poignant meditation on the life and death of the charismatic young man whose nickname provides the film\u2019s title. Using split-screen projection, it contrasts footage of a vibrant, carefree Ashes, balancing on the prow of his boat, with film of two older local men labouring in the outdoors. It turns out they are painstakingly creating a headstone for his grave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"305cda40e3f64674aac3651ecedd3bb387c71fef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/305cda40e3f64674aac3651ecedd3bb387c71fef/0_0_9973_7158/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Steve McQueen\u2019s immersive installation Ashes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"718\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Steve McQueen\u2019s immersive installation Ashes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Thomas Dane Gallery, London. \u00a9 Steve McQueen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFor many young black men, not just in the Carribean, but here as well, the choices are so limited,\u201d says McQueen. \u201cAshes is working on his boat catching lobsters for rich hotels and he finds a big stash of weed. It\u2019s an opportunity to earn some dosh and he grabs it, because he has so few choices. Same with my cousin, the reason he gets a gun in the first place is that he doesn\u2019t want to end up on the buses. In a way, those films are about the cost of wanting some liberty, the liberty that other people take for granted.\u201d</p> <p>In both instances, though, the cost is high. In <em>Ashes</em>\u2019s<em> </em>case, beneath the visual poetry of the film lies a cold, hard fact: life is cheap. McQueen nods. \u201cYes. And not just in the Caribbean, but here. People\u2019s lives are cheap.\u201d His voice rises in anger. \u201cLook around you at what\u2019s happening here \u2013 people getting stabbed every day of the month in London and no one seems to give a shit. If they did give a shit, it wouldn\u2019t happen. It happens because it\u2019s seen to be of no great importance. If it was, things would be done against it to prevent it happening.\u201d</p> <p>Though McQueen has lived in Amsterdam for more than 20 years, he still considers himself a Londoner \u2013 \u201cabsolute, total 100%!\u201d The son of West Indian parents he was raised in Shepherd\u2019s Bush and Ealing, and was continually encouraged by his father to learn a trade. \u201cThere were no examples of artists who were like me,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/04/steve-mcqueen-my-painful-childhood-shame\" title=\"\">he told the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/04/steve-mcqueen-my-painful-childhood-shame\" title=\"\">Guardian</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/04/steve-mcqueen-my-painful-childhood-shame\" title=\"\"> in 2014</a>. \u201cWhen did you see a black man doing what I do?\u201d</p> <p>He describes his primary school experience as a happy one, but in our conversation his thoughts return more than once to his secondary school days at Drayton Manor in Ealing, where, at 13, he was placed in a class for children who were deemed to be not academically up to speed. A lazy eye and undiagnosed dyslexia accentuated his sense of isolation.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I do as an artist is, I think, to do with my own life experience,\u201d he says at one point. \u201cI came of age in a school which was a microcosm of the world around me. One day, you\u2019re together as a group, the next, you are split up by people who think certain people are better than you. It was kind of interesting to observe that.\u201d</p> <p>Was there a stigma attached to that separation? \u201cOh for fucking sure. And it was informed by class and race and privilege. Absolutely. No ifs or buts or maybe about it.\u201d</p> <p>He recounts a recent meeting between himself and a woman whose young son has a major role in his forthcoming BBC series, <em>Small Axe</em>, which chronicles the everyday lives and struggles of black British people from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s. \u201cShe went to my school and had read some of the stuff I\u2019d said about my time there. She told me that the exact same things had happened to her. It turns out that she had ended up home-schooling her son so that they wouldn\u2019t happen to him. There is a lot of publicity about black kids underachieving, but that sort of thing goes unacknowledged.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d850be365368ff7a063c1f840e83f76faa6193e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d850be365368ff7a063c1f840e83f76faa6193e/0_120_3654_2192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve McQueen with his best picture Oscar for 12 Years A Slave in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve McQueen with his best picture Oscar for 12 Years A Slave in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Klamar/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He tells me another story about how a group of his old school friends bumped into one of their former teachers in a pub a few years ago. He told them that, back when they were at school, he had put forward the idea that the school should address the problem of underachieving black pupils. The teacher was told by his superior that, if they did so, it would inevitably mean that more black children would apply to the school. \u201cThey were in effect investing in black failure,\u201d says McQueen, shaking his head in disgust.</p> <p>There are some people, I suggest, who will read this and cite his own extraordinary achievements and his recent knighthood as evidence to the contrary. He shoots me a fierce look. \u201cI am sitting here in front of you doing this interview not because of, but in spite of,\u201d he says. \u201cI had every obstacle thrown up against me on the way up. And a big part of the reason I am sitting here is because of the people who went before me and made sacrifices. They helped clear the path for me because they made some noise and pushed back against racism \u2013 in music, in film, in writing, in debates, in protests. I am sitting here because of them. That\u2019s just a fact.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if he had any hesitation in accepting the honours conferred on him by the British establishment, given that the OBE and CBE are linked by name and history to the long colonial shadow cast by empire. He nods. \u201cI can see that some people would feel hesitant absolutely and, don\u2019t get me wrong, it wasn\u2019t an easy decision. It wasn\u2019t, \u2018Oh, yeah, I\u2019ll have that!\u2019 But at the same time I was like, this [knighthood] is one of the highest awards the state gives out, so I\u2019m going to take it. Because I\u2019m from here and if they want to give me an award, I\u2019ll have it, thank you very much and I\u2019ll use it for whatever I can use it for. End of story. It\u2019s about what you do, it\u2019s about being recognised. If you don\u2019t get recognition, it\u2019s easier for them to forget you.\u201d</p> <p>McQueen was first given recognition when he was accepted for Chelsea School of Art, where he found a creative home of sorts. Likewise at Goldsmiths, where Gilroy remembers him \u201cknocking on my door with a huge pile of Leni Riefenstahl photography books and talking nonstop about the history of cinema.\u201d</p> <p>At Goldsmiths and later at NYU, McQueen walked his own singular path, his fierce commitment to doing the work already evident. Gilroy reflects: \u201cI think he went to New York with high hopes of finding a fertile environment for his ideas and energies, and it turned out to be a disappointing experience.\u201d It was out of this context that <em>Drumroll</em> was created, and Gilroy muses that McQueen\u2019s decision to doggedly roll a metal oil drum mounted with cameras through the crowded streets of midtown Manhattan might on some level have been a response to that increasing sense of frustration.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When people realise that you\u2019re being open and you\u2019re listening, that creates possibilities. They become drawn to you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the YBAs made headlines and big money with their art provocations, McQueen remained an outsider. It is difficult, I say, to imagine him socialising with Damien, Tracey and co down the Groucho back in the day. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d he replies, matter of fact. \u201cI went for a drink with some people once. That was it. It was\u201d \u2013 he searches for the right word \u2013 \u201cisolating.\u201d</p> <p>Moving to Amsterdam in 1997, he found a city more suited to his temperament, and has lived quietly there ever since with his wife, Bianca Stigter, and their two children. He told one interviewer that he cried when his daughter started school there because \u201cit was so beautiful\u2026 so different.\u201d For all that, he tells me, he still loves London, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard, man, it\u2019s fucking hard. When I was coming up, I got help from the Arts Council, from Channel 4, and without that I would not be here. All that has changed and we should be fighting to get it back. It\u2019s just so bloody expensive to live in London now, but you know, there\u2019s still some magic there.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>With <em>Small Axe</em>, a six-part TV series co-commissioned by Amazon and the BBC, and scheduled for broadcast in November, McQueen turns his attention to the London of a different time and to the lives of some of the ordinary British black people who went before him. It is a project he has been connected with for several years over a protracted script development period. Set in London between 1968, the year of Enoch Powell\u2019s inflammatory \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech, and 1986, and unfolding over six hour-long episodes, the series takes its title from an early Bob Marley song. McQueen described it as a reevaluation of \u201cthe journeys that my parents and the first generation of West Indians went on to deliver me here today, calling myself a black British person.\u201d</p> <p>Today, he is keen to emphasise that \u201cit is not about the Windrush generation, but a later generation who were already established here\u201d. The opening story, which unfolds over the first two episodes, revisits a defining moment in black British experience: the protests that erupted in West London in 1970 following the police closure of the Mangrove restaurant, a lively community meeting place on All Saints Road, and the ensuing trial of local activists dubbed the Mangrove Nine.</p> <p>\u201cThere is politics in there from the start and the racism that people faced,\u201d elaborates McQueen. \u201cBut it is also about their everyday lives; how people met, fell in love, how they danced and enjoyed themselves, the vibrancy of their everyday lives. One episode is about lovers\u2019 rock, another about people meeting at a blues\u2019 dance. So, it\u2019s about the black British presence in a very real sense, how people found themselves through all those different circumstances.\u201d</p> <p><em>Small Axe</em> is McQueen\u2019s first foray into directing for television and, unsurprisingly, he has done it his own way. \u201cSteve has a film sensibility and essentially he has made a series of individual films,\u201d says one of its executive producers, Tracey Scoffield. \u201cThey remind me in a way of the great self-contained social dramas that the BBC\u2019s <em>Play For Today</em> slot broadcast back in the 1970s. It was an extraordinary experience for all of us because you realise very quickly that you are working with someone at the absolute peak of their game. He was like a general on set, taking control, marshalling the troops. His energy and commitment makes everyone raise their game.\u201d</p> <p>McQueen\u2019s work rate remains phenomenal. He has also just struck a deal with Amazon to develop a complex sci-fi thriller called <em>Last Days</em>, in which a female character tries to uncover a geopolitical conspiracy against a backdrop of ecological disaster and the rise of artificial intelligence.</p> <p>When I ask Paul Gilroy what sets Steve McQueen apart, he says, \u201cThere are places that he wants to go in his art that are almost transgressive in their extremity: the sense of discomfort he evokes, the suffering in the body, the grief you cannot articulate. These are the very things he wants to articulate visually. That\u2019s where he wants to be in his work.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, Steve McQueen has set himself an almost impossible task, but that too may be part of his extraordinary drive, his singular pursuit of the essential truths. What, I ask, does he get from film-making? He thinks about the question for a long time. \u201cThere\u2019s a power in it, but not the kind of power you might expect. There\u2019s a power in being open, in being vulnerable, in being wrong, even, and admitting it and correcting it. When people realise that you\u2019re being open and you\u2019re listening, that creates possibilities. They become responsive. They are drawn to you. That\u2019s one key part of being a director.\u201d</p> <p>Is there another key part? This time he doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYou want to cause a bit of trouble, stir things up a bit,\u201d he says, grinning, then growing animated, the words tumbling out of him like a torrent. \u201cWe\u2019re all a bit numb right now, so that\u2019s even more important. It\u2019s like, \u2018Wake up! Wake up!\u2019 Let\u2019s make some noise. There\u2019s a little bit of my youth in there, growing up in the late 70s and early 80s with punk, reggae, anti-racist protest. Anger is an energy and all that.\u201d</p> <p>Just as suddenly, he becomes quiet and reflective. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just about anger,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about seeing, contemplating, serious consideration. It\u2019s about being seen, and heard and recognised, so as the years pass they can\u2019t make you invisible. You want to ensure that what you do will have a lasting effect. That\u2019s all you can hope for, really.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/steve-mcqueen\" title=\"\">Steve McQueen</a> opens at Tate Modern, London SE1, on 13 February</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Back in 2001, seven years before he directed his first feature film, Steve McQueen made 7th Nov, an installation that features in his forthcoming Tate Modern retrospective. Visually, it is his most minimalist work: a projection of a single still photograph of the crown of a reclining man\u2019s head, which is bisected by a long, curving scar. And yet it possesses a visceral charge that unsettles more than any other piece that will be in the exhibition. That power rests in the accompanying monologue in which McQueen\u2019s cousin, Marcus, recounts in brutally graphic detail the terrible events of the day he accidentally shot and killed his own brother. 7th Nov can be seen in retrospect as a signal of what was to come as McQueen made the transition from artist to director, creating acclaimed feature films that merged formal rigour with a narrative style that is often unflinching in its depiction of human endurance. \u201cIt was tough, I can tell you that,\u201d he says, when I ask him about 7th Nov. \u201cI knew what had happened, of course, but when I was sitting in that room recording my cousin, I was hearing the full story for the first time. I mean, I had no idea. No idea.\u201d He shakes his head furiously as if trying to erase the memory. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s all about the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. End of. To get to that, you have to go in close, uncover what\u2019s been hidden or covered over. Obviously, the easy thing is not to go there, but I have a need to go there.\u201d As a feature film director, McQueen has made an art out of going there, whether evoking the unyielding nature of Irish republicanism in his debut, Hunger (2008), sexual addiction in Shame (2011) or the long nightmare of slavery in the American South in 12 Years a Slave (2013). In the process, his rapid ascendancy as a filmmaker has all but eclipsed his reputation as an artist. Which is why his imminent retrospective is timely. Through 13 carefully selected pieces, it will trace his creative arc as an artist from 1999, the year he won the Turner prize, to the present day. That means that earlier signature works such as Deadpan (1997), in which he reenacted a famous stunt by silent film star Buster Keaton, and Drumroll (1998), which saw him push a barrel thought the streets of Manhattan, are not in the show. There is one formative film included: Exodus, from 1992, which comprises Super 8 footage he impulsively shot of two elderly black men he spotted carrying potted palms though the streets of east London. It is a low-key metaphorical work that contrasts sharply with the intensity of later works such as Western Deep/Caribs\u2019 Leap (2002), which evokes the long, dark shadow of colonialism, and End Credits (2012), in which he uses redacted FBI files to show the extent of surveillance of the black singer and activist Paul Robeson. For those who only know McQueen\u2019s feature films, these non-narrative works may make for a challenging experience. \u201cMany younger people will go to Tate Modern because Steve, the Hollywood director, is an icon for them, but these works certainly require a different level of attentiveness and patience,\u201d says the author and academic Paul Gilroy, who taught McQueen at Goldsmiths in the 1980s and has written one of the catalogue essays. \u201cIt is worth the effort, not least because they offer a wealth of signals and approaches that echo through the later feature films. This is someone who, from the start, had an encyclopaedic knowledge of film and an almost obsessive interest in its history, and that underpins his art practice in often playful and provocative ways.\u201d Across the river, in Tate Britain, McQueen\u2019s epic project, Year 3, on show until May, brings his artistic journey up to date. The ground floor gallery walls are covered floor-to-ceiling with thousands of school portraits that add up to a panoramic vision of contemporary multicultural London. \u201cIt\u2019s been incredible,\u201d he says of the public reaction to Year 3 since it opened in November. \u201cPeople have been bringing their grandparents into central London sometimes for the first time to see it. Ordinary people are being seen and seeing themselves on the walls of one of the country\u2019s major art galleries. It\u2019s about recognition, really \u2013 \u2018Look! We are here!\u2019 That\u2019s a powerful thing.\u201d It is 11 years since I last interviewed Steve McQueen. In that time, he has gone from being a Turner prize-winning British artist to an internationally acclaimed director, with an Oscar for 12 Years a Slave and a couple of Baftas under his belt. In this year\u2019s New Year honours list, he was given a knighthood for services to British film, having already been the recipient of an OBE and a CBE. This extraordinary success may have mellowed him somewhat, but his impatient, coiled-up energy is still evident when we meet over early morning coffee in the almost deserted Tate Modern members\u2019 room. Once or twice during our conversation, he drums impatiently on the table or repeatedly slaps his hand as he searches for the right words to fully convey his meaning \u2013 and the full force of his conviction. When I ask him if his mainstream success as a director means that he now has to make time for his other job as an artist, he looks momentarily offended. \u201cGod no! I don\u2019t think like that at all,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cI mean, \u2018success\u2019? I don\u2019t know what that is. With me, it\u2019s about the work, whatever form it takes. I just want to do the work. Often it\u2019s work that I don\u2019t see being done elsewhere. It\u2019s the dirty work, I suppose. And sometimes I want and welcome that burden.\u201d So, you feel there is a burden to what you do, the burden of truth-telling? \u201cYes. For sure. It\u2019s about putting oneself in places that are not going to be comfortable but, by going there, you might uncover the truth of what is actually going on. Basically, my attitude is: we\u2019re all going to die anyway, so let\u2019s just go for it.\u201d The truth-telling will continue apace later this year when McQueen unveils his short non-narrative film about the Grenfell Tower fire, which claimed 72 lives on 14 June 2017. The date and location has yet to be decided and the film is still being edited, so he is reluctant to talk about it in any detail, but when pressed he admits, \u201cIt has been difficult, really difficult in so many ways. Until I was six, I lived less than a mile from there and, even after we moved out to Ealing, I\u2019d go back there to hang around Ladbroke Grove because that\u2019s where everyone I knew would hang out. So, going back there again in the circumstance was heavy, very heavy.\u201d Self-funded by McQueen, the Grenfell project is not a commercial work and will never be broadcast or shown on television, instead eventually being housed in a London space with free admission so that it is accessible to all. He describes it as \u201can artwork that is about keeping the tragedy in the collective consciousness\u201d. With the proviso that it would not be shown for two years, McQueen was granted permission by the local community to film the scorched shell of Grenfell Tower from a helicopter, before it was covered up with plastic sheeting. \u201cIt was very raw, but also very necessary,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was not about being commissioned, it was about getting permission. Initially, it was the permission to talk to the people there, to tell them who I am and where I come from \u2013 I actually used to work on a stall in Ladbroke Grove under the Westway selling secondhand clothes. It was essentially about getting their trust.\u201d He pauses for a long moment. \u201cThat building was like a skull after the fire,\u201d he says, finally. \u201cThen, as soon as they covered it up, it was almost like they were saying it never happened. So, no matter that some people might not want to deal with what happened there, I\u2019m saying, no, no. Let\u2019s not forget.\u201d Death looms like a dark shadow throughout the Tate Modern retrospective, not just in 7th Nov, but also the elegiac Ashes (2002-15), which like Carib\u2019s Leap is set in Grenada, where his father was born. It is a poignant meditation on the life and death of the charismatic young man whose nickname provides the film\u2019s title. Using split-screen projection, it contrasts footage of a vibrant, carefree Ashes, balancing on the prow of his boat, with film of two older local men labouring in the outdoors. It turns out they are painstakingly creating a headstone for his grave. \u201cFor many young black men, not just in the Carribean, but here as well, the choices are so limited,\u201d says McQueen. \u201cAshes is working on his boat catching lobsters for rich hotels and he finds a big stash of weed. It\u2019s an opportunity to earn some dosh and he grabs it, because he has so few choices. Same with my cousin, the reason he gets a gun in the first place is that he doesn\u2019t want to end up on the buses. In a way, those films are about the cost of wanting some liberty, the liberty that other people take for granted.\u201d In both instances, though, the cost is high. In Ashes\u2019s case, beneath the visual poetry of the film lies a cold, hard fact: life is cheap. McQueen nods. \u201cYes. And not just in the Caribbean, but here. People\u2019s lives are cheap.\u201d His voice rises in anger. \u201cLook around you at what\u2019s happening here \u2013 people getting stabbed every day of the month in London and no one seems to give a shit. If they did give a shit, it wouldn\u2019t happen. It happens because it\u2019s seen to be of no great importance. If it was, things would be done against it to prevent it happening.\u201d Though McQueen has lived in Amsterdam for more than 20 years, he still considers himself a Londoner \u2013 \u201cabsolute, total 100%!\u201d The son of West Indian parents he was raised in Shepherd\u2019s Bush and Ealing, and was continually encouraged by his father to learn a trade. \u201cThere were no examples of artists who were like me,\u201d he told the Guardian in 2014. \u201cWhen did you see a black man doing what I do?\u201d He describes his primary school experience as a happy one, but in our conversation his thoughts return more than once to his secondary school days at Drayton Manor in Ealing, where, at 13, he was placed in a class for children who were deemed to be not academically up to speed. A lazy eye and undiagnosed dyslexia accentuated his sense of isolation. \u201cWhat I do as an artist is, I think, to do with my own life experience,\u201d he says at one point. \u201cI came of age in a school which was a microcosm of the world around me. One day, you\u2019re together as a group, the next, you are split up by people who think certain people are better than you. It was kind of interesting to observe that.\u201d Was there a stigma attached to that separation? \u201cOh for fucking sure. And it was informed by class and race and privilege. Absolutely. No ifs or buts or maybe about it.\u201d He recounts a recent meeting between himself and a woman whose young son has a major role in his forthcoming BBC series, Small Axe, which chronicles the everyday lives and struggles of black British people from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s. \u201cShe went to my school and had read some of the stuff I\u2019d said about my time there. She told me that the exact same things had happened to her. It turns out that she had ended up home-schooling her son so that they wouldn\u2019t happen to him. There is a lot of publicity about black kids underachieving, but that sort of thing goes unacknowledged.\u201d He tells me another story about how a group of his old school friends bumped into one of their former teachers in a pub a few years ago. He told them that, back when they were at school, he had put forward the idea that the school should address the problem of underachieving black pupils. The teacher was told by his superior that, if they did so, it would inevitably mean that more black children would apply to the school. \u201cThey were in effect investing in black failure,\u201d says McQueen, shaking his head in disgust. There are some people, I suggest, who will read this and cite his own extraordinary achievements and his recent knighthood as evidence to the contrary. He shoots me a fierce look. \u201cI am sitting here in front of you doing this interview not because of, but in spite of,\u201d he says. \u201cI had every obstacle thrown up against me on the way up. And a big part of the reason I am sitting here is because of the people who went before me and made sacrifices. They helped clear the path for me because they made some noise and pushed back against racism \u2013 in music, in film, in writing, in debates, in protests. I am sitting here because of them. That\u2019s just a fact.\u201d I ask if he had any hesitation in accepting the honours conferred on him by the British establishment, given that the OBE and CBE are linked by name and history to the long colonial shadow cast by empire. He nods. \u201cI can see that some people would feel hesitant absolutely and, don\u2019t get me wrong, it wasn\u2019t an easy decision. It wasn\u2019t, \u2018Oh, yeah, I\u2019ll have that!\u2019 But at the same time I was like, this [knighthood] is one of the highest awards the state gives out, so I\u2019m going to take it. Because I\u2019m from here and if they want to give me an award, I\u2019ll have it, thank you very much and I\u2019ll use it for whatever I can use it for. End of story. It\u2019s about what you do, it\u2019s about being recognised. If you don\u2019t get recognition, it\u2019s easier for them to forget you.\u201d McQueen was first given recognition when he was accepted for Chelsea School of Art, where he found a creative home of sorts. Likewise at Goldsmiths, where Gilroy remembers him \u201cknocking on my door with a huge pile of Leni Riefenstahl photography books and talking nonstop about the history of cinema.\u201d At Goldsmiths and later at NYU, McQueen walked his own singular path, his fierce commitment to doing the work already evident. Gilroy reflects: \u201cI think he went to New York with high hopes of finding a fertile environment for his ideas and energies, and it turned out to be a disappointing experience.\u201d It was out of this context that Drumroll was created, and Gilroy muses that McQueen\u2019s decision to doggedly roll a metal oil drum mounted with cameras through the crowded streets of midtown Manhattan might on some level have been a response to that increasing sense of frustration. As the YBAs made headlines and big money with their art provocations, McQueen remained an outsider. It is difficult, I say, to imagine him socialising with Damien, Tracey and co down the Groucho back in the day. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d he replies, matter of fact. \u201cI went for a drink with some people once. That was it. It was\u201d \u2013 he searches for the right word \u2013 \u201cisolating.\u201d Moving to Amsterdam in 1997, he found a city more suited to his temperament, and has lived quietly there ever since with his wife, Bianca Stigter, and their two children. He told one interviewer that he cried when his daughter started school there because \u201cit was so beautiful\u2026 so different.\u201d For all that, he tells me, he still loves London, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard, man, it\u2019s fucking hard. When I was coming up, I got help from the Arts Council, from Channel 4, and without that I would not be here. All that has changed and we should be fighting to get it back. It\u2019s just so bloody expensive to live in London now, but you know, there\u2019s still some magic there.\u201d * * * With Small Axe, a six-part TV series co-commissioned by Amazon and the BBC, and scheduled for broadcast in November, McQueen turns his attention to the London of a different time and to the lives of some of the ordinary British black people who went before him. It is a project he has been connected with for several years over a protracted script development period. Set in London between 1968, the year of Enoch Powell\u2019s inflammatory \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech, and 1986, and unfolding over six hour-long episodes, the series takes its title from an early Bob Marley song. McQueen described it as a reevaluation of \u201cthe journeys that my parents and the first generation of West Indians went on to deliver me here today, calling myself a black British person.\u201d Today, he is keen to emphasise that \u201cit is not about the Windrush generation, but a later generation who were already established here\u201d. The opening story, which unfolds over the first two episodes, revisits a defining moment in black British experience: the protests that erupted in West London in 1970 following the police closure of the Mangrove restaurant, a lively community meeting place on All Saints Road, and the ensuing trial of local activists dubbed the Mangrove Nine. \u201cThere is politics in there from the start and the racism that people faced,\u201d elaborates McQueen. \u201cBut it is also about their everyday lives; how people met, fell in love, how they danced and enjoyed themselves, the vibrancy of their everyday lives. One episode is about lovers\u2019 rock, another about people meeting at a blues\u2019 dance. So, it\u2019s about the black British presence in a very real sense, how people found themselves through all those different circumstances.\u201d Small Axe is McQueen\u2019s first foray into directing for television and, unsurprisingly, he has done it his own way. \u201cSteve has a film sensibility and essentially he has made a series of individual films,\u201d says one of its executive producers, Tracey Scoffield. \u201cThey remind me in a way of the great self-contained social dramas that the BBC\u2019s Play For Today slot broadcast back in the 1970s. It was an extraordinary experience for all of us because you realise very quickly that you are working with someone at the absolute peak of their game. He was like a general on set, taking control, marshalling the troops. His energy and commitment makes everyone raise their game.\u201d McQueen\u2019s work rate remains phenomenal. He has also just struck a deal with Amazon to develop a complex sci-fi thriller called Last Days, in which a female character tries to uncover a geopolitical conspiracy against a backdrop of ecological disaster and the rise of artificial intelligence. When I ask Paul Gilroy what sets Steve McQueen apart, he says, \u201cThere are places that he wants to go in his art that are almost transgressive in their extremity: the sense of discomfort he evokes, the suffering in the body, the grief you cannot articulate. These are the very things he wants to articulate visually. That\u2019s where he wants to be in his work.\u201d In many ways, Steve McQueen has set himself an almost impossible task, but that too may be part of his extraordinary drive, his singular pursuit of the essential truths. What, I ask, does he get from film-making? He thinks about the question for a long time. \u201cThere\u2019s a power in it, but not the kind of power you might expect. There\u2019s a power in being open, in being vulnerable, in being wrong, even, and admitting it and correcting it. When people realise that you\u2019re being open and you\u2019re listening, that creates possibilities. They become responsive. They are drawn to you. That\u2019s one key part of being a director.\u201d Is there another key part? This time he doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYou want to cause a bit of trouble, stir things up a bit,\u201d he says, grinning, then growing animated, the words tumbling out of him like a torrent. \u201cWe\u2019re all a bit numb right now, so that\u2019s even more important. It\u2019s like, \u2018Wake up! Wake up!\u2019 Let\u2019s make some noise. There\u2019s a little bit of my youth in there, growing up in the late 70s and early 80s with punk, reggae, anti-racist protest. Anger is an energy and all that.\u201d Just as suddenly, he becomes quiet and reflective. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just about anger,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about seeing, contemplating, serious consideration. It\u2019s about being seen, and heard and recognised, so as the years pass they can\u2019t make you invisible. You want to ensure that what you do will have a lasting effect. That\u2019s all you can hope for, really.\u201d \u2022 Steve McQueen opens at Tate Modern, London SE1, on 13 February",

      "body": "<p>It feels preposterous to suggest a band who formed in 2008 are enjoying a meteoric rise, but in the case of the Teskey Brothers, it makes a weird kind of sense. They spent nine years playing the bars of Melbourne; it wasn\u2019t until the release of their 2017 album Half Mile Harvest that they performed outside of the state of Victoria. Two and a half years and a second album later, and here they are: 10,500 miles from Melbourne.

      "body": "<p>There was a hint of where it might end in how it began. On Monday 1 January 1973, the United Kingdom became a member of what was then the European Economic Community. Britain arrived not with a bang but a shrug. The union flag was raised outside the European parliament building. There were scattered celebrations this side of the Channel. A few enthusiastic celebrants lit bonfires. Most people were asleep.</p> <p>The Labour opposition chuntered that the terms of membership were poor. Ted Heath, the Tory prime minister who had negotiated entry, was absent abroad at a funeral. Pyrotechnics were conspicuous by their absence. Under the headline \u201cWe\u2019re in \u2013 but without the fireworks\u201d, the <em>Guardian</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/22/uk-enters-europe-eu-1-january-1973\" title=\"\">reported</a>: \u201cBritain passed peacefully into Europe at midnight last night without any special celebration. It was difficult to tell that anything of importance had occurred, and a date which will be entered in the history books as long as histories of Britain are written, was taken by most people as a matter of course.\u201d An opinion poll suggested that 38% of the public were happy to embark on what Mr Heath described as a great adventure, 39% were upset and 23% had no feeling either way.</p> <p>There is a mordant symmetry between the passionless nuptials 47 years ago and the divorce that will become formal at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/24/sombre-eu-leaders-sign-brexit-withdrawal-agreement\" title=\"\">11pm on 31 January</a>. There will be an unceremonious lowering of the union flag at the European parliament. The more zealous kind of Brexiter will toast their \u201cliberation\u201d from \u201ccaptivity\u201d. Some Remainers will hold mournful wakes and defiant vigils where the most unreconciled will swear to themselves that one day we will return. But, mostly, the nation appears to be planning to greet this hugely significant inflection point in its history with epic indifference.</p> <p>For all the intense emotions and violent convulsions unleashed since David Cameron made his fateful pledge to hold a referendum, for all the raging battles that consumed both his premiership and that of Theresa May, for all the banner-waving and the slogan-shouting, the climax will be most anticlimactic. It will be difficult to tell that anything of importance had occurred. This will be more the case because, practically speaking, nothing much will change for the next 11 months while Britain sits in the anteroom labelled \u201ctransition\u201d where we will be obliged to continue to apply all the EU\u2019s rules without having any further say over their formulation. The government, under the orders of a Boris Johnson who is suddenly wary of looking divisive and triumphalist, has no special plans for the night.

      "bodyText": "There was a hint of where it might end in how it began. On Monday 1 January 1973, the United Kingdom became a member of what was then the European Economic Community. Britain arrived not with a bang but a shrug. The union flag was raised outside the European parliament building. There were scattered celebrations this side of the Channel. A few enthusiastic celebrants lit bonfires. Most people were asleep. The Labour opposition chuntered that the terms of membership were poor. Ted Heath, the Tory prime minister who had negotiated entry, was absent abroad at a funeral. Pyrotechnics were conspicuous by their absence. Under the headline \u201cWe\u2019re in \u2013 but without the fireworks\u201d, the Guardian reported: \u201cBritain passed peacefully into Europe at midnight last night without any special celebration. It was difficult to tell that anything of importance had occurred, and a date which will be entered in the history books as long as histories of Britain are written, was taken by most people as a matter of course.\u201d An opinion poll suggested that 38% of the public were happy to embark on what Mr Heath described as a great adventure, 39% were upset and 23% had no feeling either way. There is a mordant symmetry between the passionless nuptials 47 years ago and the divorce that will become formal at 11pm on 31 January. There will be an unceremonious lowering of the union flag at the European parliament. The more zealous kind of Brexiter will toast their \u201cliberation\u201d from \u201ccaptivity\u201d. Some Remainers will hold mournful wakes and defiant vigils where the most unreconciled will swear to themselves that one day we will return. But, mostly, the nation appears to be planning to greet this hugely significant inflection point in its history with epic indifference. For all the intense emotions and violent convulsions unleashed since David Cameron made his fateful pledge to hold a referendum, for all the raging battles that consumed both his premiership and that of Theresa May, for all the banner-waving and the slogan-shouting, the climax will be most anticlimactic. It will be difficult to tell that anything of importance had occurred. This will be more the case because, practically speaking, nothing much will change for the next 11 months while Britain sits in the anteroom labelled \u201ctransition\u201d where we will be obliged to continue to apply all the EU\u2019s rules without having any further say over their formulation. The government, under the orders of a Boris Johnson who is suddenly wary of looking divisive and triumphalist, has no special plans for the night. A prime minister recently returned to Number 10 with a stonking majority has found it beyond his powers even to have so-called \u201cindependence day\u201d accompanied by the chimes of Big Ben. This is the way the UK\u2019s membership of the EU ends. Not with a bong but a muffled thud. How phlegmatic, how stiffened lip, how very British.

The applications have to be made by early February.</p> \n<p>The move by Labour headquarters, under the control of general secretary Jennie Formby, has prompted suspicion that Corbyn\u2019s supporters are trying to install their own people in key roles made vacant by departing staff, to ensure some continuity once Corbyn leaves in April, rather than letting a new leader fill the posts once in office.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4244b7f5-81b9-49fd-ac5d-d4045272af60\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The first stage of the contest was for potential contenders to get the backing of 22 fellow MPs by 13 January.

The general secretary needs to call a halt to this. Otherwise it looks like the party is trying to impose senior press and policy staff on whoever is elected leader in April.\u201d A Labour source denied there was any such intention, saying it had never been within the power of the leader to appoint people to the posts and that it would be unprecedented to delay filling the jobs until April.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese roles are operational, and have always been appointed within HQ, not by the leader,\u201d a Labour source said. \u201cThe party machinery continues regardless of any leadership election. Waiting three months to fill urgent vacancies would undermine the party\u2019s activity, including the mayoral and local election campaigns.\u201d</p> \n<p>The dispute reflects deep tensions between rival wings of the party \u2013 and supporters of the four remaining candidates for the leadership \u2013 over its future direction and structures, following Labour\u2019s worst general election result since 1935.</p> \n<p>Rebecca Long-Bailey is widely believed to have the backing of Corbyn himself and has already secured support of the grassroots pro-Corbyn movement Momentum.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9909268f15f16ed0a8b641289670894f8dfbe0dd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9909268f15f16ed0a8b641289670894f8dfbe0dd/0_110_3095_3866/801.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Nandy l\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisa Nandy will seek to position herself as having the best green credentials.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Last week she received a further boost, winning the endorsement of the country\u2019s second biggest union, Unite. Its general secretary, Len McCluskey, a close ally of the outgoing leader, lauded her \u201cbrains and brilliance\u201d. She now needs the backing of one more union or affiliated society to get onto the ballot paper with Keir Starmer and Lisa Nandy.</p> \n<p>The fourth contender, Emily Thornberry, is trying to use the other route onto the ballot paper, by gaining the support of 33 constituency Labour parties (CLPs). Yesterday Starmer had won the backing of 39 CLPs, Long-Bailey 15, Nandy 9 and Thornberry only 3.</p> \n<p>Nandy, who has emerged as a strong challenger to both Starmer and Long-Bailey, will this week seek to position herself as the candidate with the best \u201cgreen\u201d credentials when she unveils plans to end all public funding for overseas fossil-fuel projects. This follows a BBC <em>Newsnight </em>investigation that revealed that a government agency, UK Export Finance, channelled UK taxpayers\u2019 money into fossil-fuel projects around the world, which will together emit 69m tonnes of carbon a year. This is roughly equivalent to a sixth of the total carbon emissions of the UK.</p> \n<p>Nandy said: \u201cIf I become prime minister, I would put a stop to all public financing of fossil-fuel projects anywhere, and offer incentives to job-creating, clean-energy exports instead.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut the climate emergency means we also need to crack down on city banks to stop them investing our pensions and savings in the things fuelling the crisis and worsening poverty, flooding and wildfires across the world. In the year our country hosts the next major UN climate-change summit, we need bold action.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Labour leadership contenders and their policies</h2> \n<h2><br>Rebecca Long-Bailey</h2> \n<p><strong>Europe</strong></p> \n<p>Voted to remain and supported the party\u2019s ambiguous Brexit policy. However, has said the party\u2019s stance meant voters did not trust Labour.</p> \n<p><strong>Economy</strong></p> \n<p>She is championing a green industrial revolution, designed to create jobs and investment through schemes including home refurbishments, renewable energy and carbon capture.</p> \n<p><strong>Priorities</strong></p> \n<p>Wants to bring a more upbeat message to the party, saying Labour should be more \u201caspirational\u201d.</p> \n<p><strong>Key endorsements</strong></p> \n<p>Momentum has backed her. Unite, by far the most influential union within Labour, is also supporting her - adding huge campaigning know-how to her bid.</p> \n<p><strong>View of Corbyn era</strong></p> \n<p>Seen as the \u201ccontinuity Corbyn\u201d candidate, she has said she would give the current leader 10/10. She has said Labour had a \u201cgreat set of policies\u201d at the election but got its presentation wrong.</p> \n<h2><br>Lisa Nandy</h2> \n<p><strong>Europe</strong></p> \n<p>Came close to backing government Brexit deals, but never actually cast a vote in favour. Was a leading figure opposed to a second referendum, and urged the party to back a soft Brexit.</p> \n<p><strong>Economy</strong></p> \n<p>Reviving Britain\u2019s towns has been her focus. She has also criticised the party\u2019s free broadband offer, stating that other policies such as better bus services could have more appeal.</p> \n<p><strong>Priorities</strong></p> \n<p>Nandy has made a name for herself by campaigning on the need to do more to look after voters in Britain\u2019s towns, which she says have been neglected.</p> \n<p><strong>Key endorsements</strong></p> \n<p>The GMB union has backed her, a major coup for a candidate seen as the dark horse of the race. Also won the backing of Jess Phillips, who pulled out of the race.</p> \n<p><strong>View of Corbyn era</strong></p> \n<p>Backed Owen Smith\u2019s leadership challenge against Corbyn in 2016. More recently, she has defended Corbyn, saying he did not deserve \u201cto be trashed\u201d by the media.</p> \n<h2>Keir Starmer</h2> \n<p><strong>Europe</strong></p> \n<p>A leading figure in pushing Labour to back a second referendum before the election. However, he has now said that the debate about leaving is over.</p> \n<p><strong>Economy</strong></p> \n<p>Has said that the free-market economic model \u201chas failed\u201d and called for a more moral economy. Pushing for an EU deal that protects the economy, meaning close alignment.</p> \n<p><strong>Priorities</strong></p> \n<p>Has built his campaign around uniting the party after years of division - and winning back the trust of voters.</p> \n<p><strong>Key endorsements</strong></p> \n<p>Unison, Britain\u2019s biggest union, has backed him, and he has been receiving a lot of support among Labour branches and MPs, establishing him as the frontrunner.</p> \n<p><strong>View of Corbyn era</strong></p> \n<p>Has warned the party not to \u201cover-steer\u201d away from Corbynism following the election result - seen as his attempt to win favour among the party\u2019s pro-Corbyn membership.</p> \n<h2>Emily Thornberry</h2> \n<p><strong>Europe</strong></p> \n<p>Thornberry was a leading voice in the shadow cabinet backing the idea of a second referendum. She has said she would have campaigned for Remain.</p> \n<p><strong>Economy</strong></p> \n<p>Has said the rich do not pay enough tax and has vowed to put up rates for the wealthy. \u201cTax rates have gone down,\u201d she has said. \u201cI\u2019d make them the average of the rich countries around the world.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Priorities</strong></p> \n<p>Taking on Johnson. She has described herself as the candidate best placed to \u201cfrighten the life out of\u201d him at prime minister\u2019s questions.</p> \n<p><strong>Key endorsements</strong></p> \n<p>Has only just secured enough support from MPs to reach this stage. Now needs support from local Labour parties, but only three have backed her so far.</p> \n<p><strong>View of Corbyn era</strong></p> \n<p>Represents a neighbouring seat to Corbyn and has remained loyal to him, but criticised his decision to back an election before Brexit was resolved.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Allies of Jeremy Corbyn have been accused of trying to cement their power at the top of the party after they announced plans to appoint new staff to senior posts before the next leader is elected. The party sent an email to staff last week advertising posts of head of press and broadcasting, head of policy development, and deputy regional director in London. The applications have to be made by early February. The move by Labour headquarters, under the control of general secretary Jennie Formby, has prompted suspicion that Corbyn\u2019s supporters are trying to install their own people in key roles made vacant by departing staff, to ensure some continuity once Corbyn leaves in April, rather than letting a new leader fill the posts once in office. One party insider said: \u201cIt is obvious that some of these jobs are of sufficient seniority and importance to how the Labour party will work for many years that they should not be advertised and appointed until the new leader is in place. The general secretary needs to call a halt to this. Otherwise it looks like the party is trying to impose senior press and policy staff on whoever is elected leader in April.\u201d A Labour source denied there was any such intention, saying it had never been within the power of the leader to appoint people to the posts and that it would be unprecedented to delay filling the jobs until April. \u201cThese roles are operational, and have always been appointed within HQ, not by the leader,\u201d a Labour source said. \u201cThe party machinery continues regardless of any leadership election. Waiting three months to fill urgent vacancies would undermine the party\u2019s activity, including the mayoral and local election campaigns.\u201d The dispute reflects deep tensions between rival wings of the party \u2013 and supporters of the four remaining candidates for the leadership \u2013 over its future direction and structures, following Labour\u2019s worst general election result since 1935. Rebecca Long-Bailey is widely believed to have the backing of Corbyn himself and has already secured support of the grassroots pro-Corbyn movement Momentum. Last week she received a further boost, winning the endorsement of the country\u2019s second biggest union, Unite. Its general secretary, Len McCluskey, a close ally of the outgoing leader, lauded her \u201cbrains and brilliance\u201d. She now needs the backing of one more union or affiliated society to get onto the ballot paper with Keir Starmer and Lisa Nandy. The fourth contender, Emily Thornberry, is trying to use the other route onto the ballot paper, by gaining the support of 33 constituency Labour parties (CLPs). Yesterday Starmer had won the backing of 39 CLPs, Long-Bailey 15, Nandy 9 and Thornberry only 3. Nandy, who has emerged as a strong challenger to both Starmer and Long-Bailey, will this week seek to position herself as the candidate with the best \u201cgreen\u201d credentials when she unveils plans to end all public funding for overseas fossil-fuel projects. This follows a BBC Newsnight investigation that revealed that a government agency, UK Export Finance, channelled UK taxpayers\u2019 money into fossil-fuel projects around the world, which will together emit 69m tonnes of carbon a year. This is roughly equivalent to a sixth of the total carbon emissions of the UK. Nandy said: \u201cIf I become prime minister, I would put a stop to all public financing of fossil-fuel projects anywhere, and offer incentives to job-creating, clean-energy exports instead. \u201cBut the climate emergency means we also need to crack down on city banks to stop them investing our pensions and savings in the things fuelling the crisis and worsening poverty, flooding and wildfires across the world. In the year our country hosts the next major UN climate-change summit, we need bold action.\u201d Labour leadership contenders and their policies Rebecca Long-Bailey Europe Voted to remain and supported the party\u2019s ambiguous Brexit policy. However, has said the party\u2019s stance meant voters did not trust Labour. Economy She is championing a green industrial revolution, designed to create jobs and investment through schemes including home refurbishments, renewable energy and carbon capture. Priorities Wants to bring a more upbeat message to the party, saying Labour should be more \u201caspirational\u201d. Key endorsements Momentum has backed her. Unite, by far the most influential union within Labour, is also supporting her - adding huge campaigning know-how to her bid. View of Corbyn era Seen as the \u201ccontinuity Corbyn\u201d candidate, she has said she would give the current leader 10/10. She has said Labour had a \u201cgreat set of policies\u201d at the election but got its presentation wrong. Lisa Nandy Europe Came close to backing government Brexit deals, but never actually cast a vote in favour. Was a leading figure opposed to a second referendum, and urged the party to back a soft Brexit. Economy Reviving Britain\u2019s towns has been her focus. She has also criticised the party\u2019s free broadband offer, stating that other policies such as better bus services could have more appeal. Priorities Nandy has made a name for herself by campaigning on the need to do more to look after voters in Britain\u2019s towns, which she says have been neglected. Key endorsements The GMB union has backed her, a major coup for a candidate seen as the dark horse of the race. Also won the backing of Jess Phillips, who pulled out of the race. View of Corbyn era Backed Owen Smith\u2019s leadership challenge against Corbyn in 2016. More recently, she has defended Corbyn, saying he did not deserve \u201cto be trashed\u201d by the media. Keir Starmer Europe A leading figure in pushing Labour to back a second referendum before the election. However, he has now said that the debate about leaving is over. Economy Has said that the free-market economic model \u201chas failed\u201d and called for a more moral economy. Pushing for an EU deal that protects the economy, meaning close alignment. Priorities Has built his campaign around uniting the party after years of division - and winning back the trust of voters. Key endorsements Unison, Britain\u2019s biggest union, has backed him, and he has been receiving a lot of support among Labour branches and MPs, establishing him as the frontrunner. View of Corbyn era Has warned the party not to \u201cover-steer\u201d away from Corbynism following the election result - seen as his attempt to win favour among the party\u2019s pro-Corbyn membership. Emily Thornberry Europe Thornberry was a leading voice in the shadow cabinet backing the idea of a second referendum. She has said she would have campaigned for Remain. Economy Has said the rich do not pay enough tax and has vowed to put up rates for the wealthy. \u201cTax rates have gone down,\u201d she has said. \u201cI\u2019d make them the average of the rich countries around the world.\u201d Priorities Taking on Johnson. She has described herself as the candidate best placed to \u201cfrighten the life out of\u201d him at prime minister\u2019s questions. Key endorsements Has only just secured enough support from MPs to reach this stage. Now needs support from local Labour parties, but only three have backed her so far. View of Corbyn era Represents a neighbouring seat to Corbyn and has remained loyal to him, but criticised his decision to back an election before Brexit was resolved.",

      "bodyText": "I sometimes wonder, having studied engineering at university, whether I should have headed for California to pan for digital gold, working as a coder for one of Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants or trying my luck at an overvalued startup with employee share options. Anna Wiener\u2019s book is a reassuring reminder that, had I gone, I probably would have hated it. Uncanny Valley is a memoir with few revelations for those who have had contact with the technology industry. Even people familiar with it only through media coverage will already recognise Silicon Valley as a world of young men (and it has to be said, a few women) who have had their egos massaged perhaps a little too hard and a little too long. Their stories of failure and greed, sexual harassment and bullying, toxic cultures fomented by bloated valuations of firms that turn out to be built on thin air, have become our generation\u2019s cautionary tales. And that\u2019s to say nothing of Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Wiener\u2019s account is not designed to shock in the way others have. It is instead intimate, the rolling thoughts of a young hipster sucked into this world against her better judgment. A New Yorker with a liberal arts background who started her career in publishing, she worked briefly in her 20s in Silicon Valley in customer support.

      "body": "<p>Emerson Hernandez and his daughter Maddie have withstood hunger and thirst.</p> <p>They\u2019ve been dumped in a threatening border city in Mexico, a foreign country with nowhere to shelter. And, for seven months, they\u2019ve been locked up at what critics call a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amnestyusa.org/theberkskids/\">baby jail</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The father and daughter have weathered all of this just for a chance at asylum in the United States after they fled a home in Guatemala that\u2019s now overrun with crime.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want my daughter to grow up in that environment of delinquency. I really am afraid that something could happen to her,\u201d Emerson told the Guardian.</p> <p>Maddie has been detained <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/department-of-homeland-security-tell-ice-to-free-maddie\">the longest of any child currently held in family immigration detention</a> across the country, her attorneys say. On 17 January, she turned seven years old at Berks county residential center, a controversial detention facility in Pennsylvania where she has spent roughly 8% of her life.</p> <p>Despite her lawyers exhausting the legal avenues that could get her out, the government won\u2019t release her and Emerson together.</p> <p>A spokesperson for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the agency detaining them, said, \u201cICE\u2019s custodial determinations for Mr. Hernandez and Maddie have been based on the merits and factors of their individual cases and are in conformity with the law and current agency priorities, guidelines and legal mandates.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc909024a0eb54efcf59c3e1d02b47f20485beb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc909024a0eb54efcf59c3e1d02b47f20485beb3/0_126_720_900/400.jpg\" alt=\"Maddie and Emerson Hernandez in Tijuana, Mexico.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maddie and Emerson Hernandez in Tijuana, Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Madelin Hernandez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Emerson said Maddie has always been strong, but being confined for such a long time has changed her. She\u2019s gone from an easy, smiley little girl to someone who has become violent and throws explosive temper tantrums, according to her parents and an attorney.</p> <p>\u201cHer change was sudden,\u201d Emerson said. \u201cAnd she says to me, \u2018When are we going to leave this place?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The truth is no one knows. The Flores settlement, <a href=\"https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/flores-settlement-brief-history-and-next-steps\">a landmark 1997 federal agreement</a> that regulates child and family detention, made it the longstanding rule that kids and families should be released within 20 days. But there have been huge exceptions: Bridget Cambria, a lawyer representing Maddie, said the longest she was aware of a child being held through family detention was 707 days.</p> <p>Emerson and Maddie are desperate to see the rest of their family, Maddie\u2019s mother, Madelin, and her newborn baby, who still hasn\u2019t met his dad. Madelin traveled to the US with a visa and lives in New Jersey, but Maddie\u2019s visa application was denied. She and Emerson made a more perilous journey north last spring, when they went a full day without stopping.</p> <p>\u201cThat day was hard for me,\u201d Emerson remembered. \u201cTo see that my daughter said to me, \u2018Papi, I\u2019m thirsty, Papi, I want to eat,\u2019 and I had nothing to give her.\u201d</p> <p>Madelin said she came to the US because she thought her family would be reunited soon after. But Maddie and Emerson were swept into the Trump administration\u2019s increasingly hardline immigration policies, and Madelin hasn\u2019t seen them since.</p> <p>Last April, Emerson and Maddie finally made it to the US only to be turned back to Tijuana, Mexico, through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/20/immigration-remain-in-mexico-policy-border-migrants\">Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP)</a>, a Trump-era program that returns people across the border while they await US immigration court hearings.</p> <p>Suddenly, they were homeless in one of the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/news/2019/07/24/most-dangerous-cities-world-tijuana-caracas-cape-town/1813211001/\">most dangerous cities</a>.</p> <p>Emerson called Madelin to say there was no space for them at the local shelter. \u201cI remember that he started to cry, and I did, too, because we didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/16/us-immigration-tent-court-trump-mexico\">Inside Trump's tent immigration courts that turn away thousands of asylum seekers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A US Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said around 57,000 people had been subject to MPP, and in October, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-babies-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-migrant-policy-sends-thousands-of-children-including-babies-back-to-mexico-idUSKBN1WQ1H1\">Reuters</a> found that 16,000 migrants under 18 had been sent to Mexico.</p> <p>At least 816 violent attacks against migrants under MPP have been reported, including 201 cases of children who were kidnapped or almost kidnapped, <a href=\"https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/MPP-aYearofHorrors-FINAL.pdf\">according to the </a><a href=\"https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/MPP-aYearofHorrors-FINAL.pdf\">not-for-profit Human Rights First.</a></p> <p>On days when Emerson and Maddie found housing with good Samaritans, she rarely went outside because the city was so dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cTijuana is not a very pretty place, it\u2019s not a safe place,\u201d Emerson said.</p> <p>After two months in Mexico, they got their opportunity to go in front of a US immigration judge in June. Emerson made the mistake of following advice he said an immigration official gave him. He told the judge that he had come to the US to give his daughter a better life, a line that completely discredited his case.</p> <p>There are immigration laws that protect asylum seekers. There aren\u2019t immigration laws that protect devoted parents.</p> <p>The judge gave him two options: he could return to Mexico and, against all odds, continue to fight for the right to come to the US. Or \u2013 after all Emerson and Maddie had endured \u2013they could return to Guatemala.</p> <p>Faced with an impossible choice, Emerson opted for the latter because at least if something happened to him at home, his family could look after his daughter and wife.

      "bodyText": "Emerson Hernandez and his daughter Maddie have withstood hunger and thirst. They\u2019ve been dumped in a threatening border city in Mexico, a foreign country with nowhere to shelter. And, for seven months, they\u2019ve been locked up at what critics call a \u201cbaby jail\u201d. The father and daughter have weathered all of this just for a chance at asylum in the United States after they fled a home in Guatemala that\u2019s now overrun with crime. \u201cI don\u2019t want my daughter to grow up in that environment of delinquency. I really am afraid that something could happen to her,\u201d Emerson told the Guardian. Maddie has been detained the longest of any child currently held in family immigration detention across the country, her attorneys say. On 17 January, she turned seven years old at Berks county residential center, a controversial detention facility in Pennsylvania where she has spent roughly 8% of her life. Despite her lawyers exhausting the legal avenues that could get her out, the government won\u2019t release her and Emerson together. A spokesperson for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the agency detaining them, said, \u201cICE\u2019s custodial determinations for Mr. Hernandez and Maddie have been based on the merits and factors of their individual cases and are in conformity with the law and current agency priorities, guidelines and legal mandates.\u201d Emerson said Maddie has always been strong, but being confined for such a long time has changed her. She\u2019s gone from an easy, smiley little girl to someone who has become violent and throws explosive temper tantrums, according to her parents and an attorney. \u201cHer change was sudden,\u201d Emerson said. \u201cAnd she says to me, \u2018When are we going to leave this place?\u2019\u201d The truth is no one knows. The Flores settlement, a landmark 1997 federal agreement that regulates child and family detention, made it the longstanding rule that kids and families should be released within 20 days. But there have been huge exceptions: Bridget Cambria, a lawyer representing Maddie, said the longest she was aware of a child being held through family detention was 707 days. Emerson and Maddie are desperate to see the rest of their family, Maddie\u2019s mother, Madelin, and her newborn baby, who still hasn\u2019t met his dad. Madelin traveled to the US with a visa and lives in New Jersey, but Maddie\u2019s visa application was denied. She and Emerson made a more perilous journey north last spring, when they went a full day without stopping. \u201cThat day was hard for me,\u201d Emerson remembered. \u201cTo see that my daughter said to me, \u2018Papi, I\u2019m thirsty, Papi, I want to eat,\u2019 and I had nothing to give her.\u201d Madelin said she came to the US because she thought her family would be reunited soon after. But Maddie and Emerson were swept into the Trump administration\u2019s increasingly hardline immigration policies, and Madelin hasn\u2019t seen them since. Last April, Emerson and Maddie finally made it to the US only to be turned back to Tijuana, Mexico, through the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), a Trump-era program that returns people across the border while they await US immigration court hearings. Suddenly, they were homeless in one of the world\u2019s most dangerous cities. Emerson called Madelin to say there was no space for them at the local shelter. \u201cI remember that he started to cry, and I did, too, because we didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said. A US Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said around 57,000 people had been subject to MPP, and in October, Reuters found that 16,000 migrants under 18 had been sent to Mexico. At least 816 violent attacks against migrants under MPP have been reported, including 201 cases of children who were kidnapped or almost kidnapped, according to the not-for-profit Human Rights First. On days when Emerson and Maddie found housing with good Samaritans, she rarely went outside because the city was so dangerous. \u201cTijuana is not a very pretty place, it\u2019s not a safe place,\u201d Emerson said. After two months in Mexico, they got their opportunity to go in front of a US immigration judge in June. Emerson made the mistake of following advice he said an immigration official gave him. He told the judge that he had come to the US to give his daughter a better life, a line that completely discredited his case. There are immigration laws that protect asylum seekers. There aren\u2019t immigration laws that protect devoted parents. The judge gave him two options: he could return to Mexico and, against all odds, continue to fight for the right to come to the US. Or \u2013 after all Emerson and Maddie had endured \u2013they could return to Guatemala. Faced with an impossible choice, Emerson opted for the latter because at least if something happened to him at home, his family could look after his daughter and wife. But when he and Maddie boarded a plane, it didn\u2019t land in Guatemala. Instead, they took a long trip deep into the country\u2019s interior, to Berks county residential center in Leesport, Pennsylvania. The family immigration detention facility garnered national notoriety a few years ago after an employee admitted to sexually assaulting a 19-year-old woman who was being held there. Critics have advocated for its closure, and reports of poor medical care and racism from employees have hamstrung the facility\u2019s reputation. But it continues to operate, as it has since 2001. After Emerson and Maddie arrived at Berks, they met Cambria, the attorney who has helped to revive their asylum bid. When the government flew them to San Diego in July and tried to return them to Mexico again, Cambria quickly filed a federal lawsuit to bring them back to Berks, where they\u2019ve remained ever since. That lawsuit could eventually set a major precedent as to whether children can legally be placed under MPP. A ruling in Maddie\u2019s favor would mean other kids like her could sue the government, arguing they shouldn\u2019t be sent to Mexico. (Ice\u2019s spokesperson said the agency did not comment on pending litigation.) But Maddie didn\u2019t come to the US to challenge immigration policy. She\u2019s a kid who celebrated a Christmas and a birthday in detention, without her mom and little brother. \u201cThis little girl is not doing well psychologically, we\u2019ll put it that way,\u201d said Cambria. \u201cShe\u2019s saying things that are scary. She\u2019s very sad.\u201d Ice has offered for Maddie to leave Berks, but without Emerson. This family separation is legally dubious, and Cambria said it was unprecedented in her experience representing immigrant families. Amy Maldonado, another of Maddie\u2019s lawyers, said Ice could release both Maddie and Emerson at any time, and has done so for families in similar situations. Cambria said she doesn\u2019t know why Ice is treating Emerson and Maddie differently from any other family at Berks. But the detention center is only for parents with children. If Maddie leaves and Emerson doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll be sent away to another facility for adults or returned to Mexico. Maddie is so young that she thinks of everything she\u2019s gone through as a vacation, and she keeps telling her parents she\u2019s ready for the vacation to be over. \u201cWhen I speak to her, she sometimes cries and says, \u2018Mami, I want to leave already,\u2019\u201d Madelin said. \u201c\u2018I want to leave already.\u2019\u201d",

The dog\u2019s jaunty walk and cheerful eye are calculated to canine perfection. The contours of the bird\u2019s fluttery wing are described in a single superlative sliver.

And some of the exhibits at the Royal Academy amount to little more than doodles on envelopes, the margins of letters or magazine spreads.

It is also one of the wildest sights in this show. A concatenation of trompe l\u2019oeil textures that looks all the way forward to pop, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/14/richard-hamilton-interview-serpentine-cooke\" title=\"\">Richard Hamilton</a>, Patrick Caulfield and beyond, plus a loose and almost self-parodic variation of his cubist heads. It is startling, liberated, humorous.</p> <p>Which is an aspect of Picasso you see on paper far more than canvas. It is there in those lithe <em>jeux d\u2019esprit, </em>where he summarises the quizzical eccentricity of a <a href=\"https://www.artrepublic.com/articles/281-the-line-drawings-of-pablo-picasso-html/\" title=\"\">penguin</a> in one continuous line. It\u2019s there in those weird late lithographs, where the priapic artist hoists his paintbrush, so to speak, in a brothel. And in the magical accordion-pleat trick where he cuts, draws and folds a single sheet of paper \u2013 in which order it is impossible to tell \u2013 to make a table-top sculpture of a woman in both positive and negative, speaking as well as silent.</p> <p>Paper holds a fascination in itself. Nicknamed \u201cthe king of the rag-pickers\u201d by the poet Jean Cocteau, Picasso loved children\u2019s lined jotters, cardboard matchbooks and cheap pads where the pages could be used and torn off with all the speed of his thinking. That colossal modernist icebreaker, <em><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79766\" title=\"\">Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon</a></em>, was pieced together out of dozens of such drawings, many of them displayed in this show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"32c67a28a68208b7eff923959b18f441d47be895\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32c67a28a68208b7eff923959b18f441d47be895/85_88_9890_6537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Ripped and snipped and bound together\u2019: Women at Their Toilette, Paris, winter 1937-8.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Ripped and snipped and bound together\u2019: Women at Their Toilette, Paris, winter 1937-8.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Succession Picasso/DACS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oil gliding over smooth bonded paper, watercolour sinking into cartridge, coloured pencils catching on the coarse weave of blotting paper: Picasso relishes every variation. He makes a sculpture of thick crumpled paper, overlays litho with chalk or pastel, tears a paper napkin and burns two eyes and a mouth with a cigarette end to make the poignant little <em>Head</em>.</p> <p>The very delicate <em>Violin</em>, from 1912, is a single page from which shapely voids have been cut, to imply the F-holes, strings and bridge. Pasted inside a folded sheet of antique laid paper, the instrument becomes luminous when held to the light, a rival watermark to the 19th-century script that scrolls around it like violin music.</p> <p>The show is arranged with chronological concision, from the rose and blue periods, through cubism, surrealism, and neoclassicism to the obsessive investigations into Manet and Delacroix, and finally to the late minotaurs and musketeers.

      "bodyText": "A dog and a dove open this stupendous performance on paper \u2013 each cut from a slip of frail tissue. The dog\u2019s jaunty walk and cheerful eye are calculated to canine perfection. The contours of the bird\u2019s fluttery wing are described in a single superlative sliver. Picasso is drawing with a pair of scissors, making creatures that seem to live and move in their own characteristic way. He was not more than nine years old. That these marvellous scraps survive is no surprise. The whole of this immense exhibition \u2013 gallery after gallery, numbering around 300 drawings, and a luxurious quantity of paintings \u2013 is nothing less than an accumulation of sacred relics. Picasso pere, also an artist, saved every fragment of his son\u2019s juvenilia and collectors have followed suit ever since, from the humble barman to the dollar zillionaire. The stories of Picasso paying his brasserie bills with a casual sketch on the menu are all true. And some of the exhibits at the Royal Academy amount to little more than doodles on envelopes, the margins of letters or magazine spreads. The master adds a saucy leg to a Vogue model and the page enters the art museum, despite being the least work here, in every respect. The greatest, in the most literal sense, is a collage nearly five metres in length. Women at Their Toilette (1937-8) is an outsize assemblage of postcards, coloured paper and lengths of wallpaper simulating brickwork, parquet, garish furnishing fabrics and so on, ripped and snipped and bound together with overpainted elements \u2013 three female heads and one more in the mirror\u2019s reflection, a painting within a painting. This is the same astonishing facility you see in the dog and dove, now used by the adult Picasso to return \u2013 the work of a lifetime, he once said \u2013 to the untutored art of a child. It is also one of the wildest sights in this show. A concatenation of trompe l\u2019oeil textures that looks all the way forward to pop, Richard Hamilton, Patrick Caulfield and beyond, plus a loose and almost self-parodic variation of his cubist heads. It is startling, liberated, humorous. Which is an aspect of Picasso you see on paper far more than canvas. It is there in those lithe jeux d\u2019esprit, where he summarises the quizzical eccentricity of a penguin in one continuous line. It\u2019s there in those weird late lithographs, where the priapic artist hoists his paintbrush, so to speak, in a brothel. And in the magical accordion-pleat trick where he cuts, draws and folds a single sheet of paper \u2013 in which order it is impossible to tell \u2013 to make a table-top sculpture of a woman in both positive and negative, speaking as well as silent. Paper holds a fascination in itself. Nicknamed \u201cthe king of the rag-pickers\u201d by the poet Jean Cocteau, Picasso loved children\u2019s lined jotters, cardboard matchbooks and cheap pads where the pages could be used and torn off with all the speed of his thinking. That colossal modernist icebreaker, Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon, was pieced together out of dozens of such drawings, many of them displayed in this show. Oil gliding over smooth bonded paper, watercolour sinking into cartridge, coloured pencils catching on the coarse weave of blotting paper: Picasso relishes every variation. He makes a sculpture of thick crumpled paper, overlays litho with chalk or pastel, tears a paper napkin and burns two eyes and a mouth with a cigarette end to make the poignant little Head. The very delicate Violin, from 1912, is a single page from which shapely voids have been cut, to imply the F-holes, strings and bridge. Pasted inside a folded sheet of antique laid paper, the instrument becomes luminous when held to the light, a rival watermark to the 19th-century script that scrolls around it like violin music. The show is arranged with chronological concision, from the rose and blue periods, through cubism, surrealism, and neoclassicism to the obsessive investigations into Manet and Delacroix, and finally to the late minotaurs and musketeers. But at every stage Picasso branches out, making lightbulbs out of paper, ballet costumes out of card, guitars from pasteboard and string. If his preoccupation with the female sex was ever in doubt, the incessant images of women sitting, standing, weeping and very occasionally smiling, nude and clothed, are the one unvarying theme from first to last. Picasso\u2019s line is intensely familiar \u2013 strong, suave, tensile \u2013 even from the very earliest works. And it carries through this show, from wall to wall, round every corner, through the smallest and grandest works, like an electrical charge. It has unfailing vigour as its uppermost characteristic, along with a zeal for clarity that characterises even the most complicated cubist drawings. You see it at its most refined in a series of neoclassical portraits, above all an exquisite drawing of Igor Stravinsky. All of the composer\u2019s acerbic logicality and self-discipline are distilled in the knife-edge contours of his frown, spectacles and few strands of combed hair \u2013 a couple of dozen gleaming lines. Picasso was 39 when he made this drawing; by now you feel he could do it in his sleep. It is compulsive, but is it also an involuntary urge? \u201cI draw,\u201d he said, \u201clike other people bite their nails.\u201d At the Royal Academy, this virtuosity comes to feel athletic, relentless, inexhaustible. The eye is compelled along by such coruscating brilliance, image after image, but all the while the irresistible question is rising: does one subject matter more than another? Does the meaning shift with each revolution in method? Is one woman \u2013 or idea, or emotion \u2013 more important than the next? A late gallery is given over to Henri-Georges Clouzot\u2019s famous 1956 film Le myst\u00e8re Picasso, in which the 75-year-old artist is shown performing his genius for a crew of film-makers against the clock. He is drawing on unprinted newspaper, using the new felt-pen inks, among other media, and Clouzot shows both sides of the page. Picasso sits before the easel, in a pair of shorts, working up image after teeming image; which appear, on the other side, like a kind of brilliant animation emerging at high speed before your eyes.

And, with a World Cup less than two years away, the chance of becoming a dual-code international is another incentive. \u201cThat\u2019s what I came into the game for, things like that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s why we play the game and what we do. I\u2019m a bit of a rugby nerd and I\u2019ve studied all the games I played last year. Honestly, I\u2019m miles ahead now compared to where I was then, I know that much. I don\u2019t want to say I was disappointed but I\u2019d like to think I can offer more now for sure.\u201d One thing Burrell hopes he will not have to contend with, though, is the spotlight. \u201cI won\u2019t have as much pressure as some other guys coming into the competition this season and that suits me perfectly,\u201d he says. \u201cI can just go about my business quietly and try and establish myself as a rugby league player. \u201cThere are lads miles ahead of me but nobody is the complete rugby league player. What people also have to understand is that, with league and union progressing so much in the last decade, guys like Jason Robinson simply crossing over and cracking it, those days are long gone. I\u2019m still in transition but I do feel that I\u2019ve given myself the best shot possible.\u201d If he fulfils those promises and rediscovers the form that made him a success at Northampton, it is not beyond possibility that he may have grabbed the spotlight back from the high-profile imports by the end of this season.",

      "body": "<p>As the self-assessment tax return deadline looms this week, the pressure is on for millions of self-employed workers and business owners. Getting the paperwork in on time is an annual headache \u2013 and that pressure may make them more susceptible to scams.</p> <p>In the last year, HMRC has received 900,000 reports of suspicious phone calls, texts and emails \u2013 most promising tax rebates. And they are becoming more sophisticated and increasingly convincing.</p> <p>With a galling similarity to official communications \u2013 using the same logo and seemingly official reference numbers \u2013 emails from fraudsters ask recipients to click on a PDF attachment, which then requires them to fill in their bank details.</p> <p>Calls from numbers which look identical to HMRC are also increasing. They can even include Government Gateway account numbers \u2013 which makes them very easy to fall for, and infuriating for those who succumb.</p> <p>\u201cWe are human, so we can make mistakes. Even cautious people click on malicious attachments or links,\u201d says Jake Moore, a specialist at internet security company ESET. As the scams spread to social media, where many people may not be expecting to be contacted about tax details, and via direct messaging through Facebook and WhatsApp, there is one simple rule to remember - HMRC stresses it never uses any social media to offer a tax rebate, or ask for personal or financial information.</p> <p>The scams do not always come in the enticing form of a promised rebate. Calls can be far more threatening, telling their target they owe money and will be arrested for tax fraud or have their bank account frozen within hours if they don\u2019t pay.</p> <p>Be on the alert for automated calls. Ray Walsh from ProPrivacy.com particularly warns about accepting so-called \u201crobocalls\u201d, which aim to trick people into pressing a key on their keypad to connect to a caseworker to make a payment. Some have succeeded in adding charges to a victim\u2019s phone bill simply by making them press a key.</p> <p>Matthew Singleton, a Manchester-based finance professional, was targeted by scammers shortly before Christmas. He received a call from an 020 number and was taken through security. The scammer knew his name and address and told him he had underpaid his income tax.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They know what the trigger points are, and that if a call or email is out of the blue you can start to get flustered</p> <footer> <cite>Joel Lewis, Age UK</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Singleton said it was a scam, he was told to Google \u201cHMRC\u201d and go to the contacts section of the site. The scammer said he would ring back from an 0300 number listed there. \u201cMy phone then came up with this 0300 number \u2013 the exact same number as on the HMRC website,\u201d says Singleton.

      "bodyText": "As the self-assessment tax return deadline looms this week, the pressure is on for millions of self-employed workers and business owners. Getting the paperwork in on time is an annual headache \u2013 and that pressure may make them more susceptible to scams. In the last year, HMRC has received 900,000 reports of suspicious phone calls, texts and emails \u2013 most promising tax rebates. And they are becoming more sophisticated and increasingly convincing. With a galling similarity to official communications \u2013 using the same logo and seemingly official reference numbers \u2013 emails from fraudsters ask recipients to click on a PDF attachment, which then requires them to fill in their bank details. Calls from numbers which look identical to HMRC are also increasing. They can even include Government Gateway account numbers \u2013 which makes them very easy to fall for, and infuriating for those who succumb. \u201cWe are human, so we can make mistakes. Even cautious people click on malicious attachments or links,\u201d says Jake Moore, a specialist at internet security company ESET. As the scams spread to social media, where many people may not be expecting to be contacted about tax details, and via direct messaging through Facebook and WhatsApp, there is one simple rule to remember - HMRC stresses it never uses any social media to offer a tax rebate, or ask for personal or financial information. The scams do not always come in the enticing form of a promised rebate. Calls can be far more threatening, telling their target they owe money and will be arrested for tax fraud or have their bank account frozen within hours if they don\u2019t pay. Be on the alert for automated calls. Ray Walsh from ProPrivacy.com particularly warns about accepting so-called \u201crobocalls\u201d, which aim to trick people into pressing a key on their keypad to connect to a caseworker to make a payment. Some have succeeded in adding charges to a victim\u2019s phone bill simply by making them press a key. Matthew Singleton, a Manchester-based finance professional, was targeted by scammers shortly before Christmas. He received a call from an 020 number and was taken through security. The scammer knew his name and address and told him he had underpaid his income tax. When Singleton said it was a scam, he was told to Google \u201cHMRC\u201d and go to the contacts section of the site. The scammer said he would ring back from an 0300 number listed there. \u201cMy phone then came up with this 0300 number \u2013 the exact same number as on the HMRC website,\u201d says Singleton. He was told he could pay the amount owed \u2013 more than \u00a34,800 \u2013 over the phone. \u201cThere was no way I was doing that. I had not had any documentation. But I was told an arrest warrant would be issued within two hours of the call ending.\u201d Singleton reported the scam to Action Fraud but believes HMRC could do more to increase awareness. \u201cWhen you Google HMRC, why can\u2019t it put a warning under its link to explain that this could happen?

The central idea of Brexit is indeed part of 18th- and 19th-century European culture: the nation state as the primary locus of political loyalty and as the collective manifestation of a unified \u201cpeople\u201d.

For most of its history as a state, it has been at the heart not of a national polity, but of a vast multinational and polyglot empire. And the UK is itself a four-nation amalgam of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There is no single pre-EU UK \u201cnation\u201d to return to. There is no unified \u201cpeople\u201d to whom power is being returned. And this is the contradiction that the Brexit project cannot even acknowledge, let alone resolve.</p> <p>Scotland and Northern Ireland rejected Brexit even more emphatically in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/dec/12/uk-general-election-2019-full-results-live-labour-conservatives-tories\" title=\"\">general election of 2019</a> than they had done in the referendum of 2016 and a clear majority of voters in the UK as a whole voted in 2019 for parties that promised a second referendum and an opportunity to stay in the EU. So while Johnson likes to talk of 31 January as <a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/07/full-text-pm-boriss-first-speech-in-the-commons/\" title=\"\">\u201cthis pivotal moment</a> in our national story\u201d, there is neither a settled nation nor a shared story. Brexit is not Northern Ireland\u2019s story. It is not Scotland\u2019s story. It is not even London\u2019s story. It is the national origin myth of the place that Anthony Barnett, co-founder of openDemocracy, calls <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anthonybarnett/status/1205295652697186305?lang=en\" title=\"\">\u201cEngland without London\u201d</a>.</p> <p>There is no doubt that Brexit has worked in the way that nationalist movements try to \u2013 it has united people across great divides of social class and geography in the name of a transcendent identity. Many of those people, if not quite drunk on scrumpy and bawling Brexit shanties, will feel real joy on 31 January. But the problem is that this unity of national purpose functions within a nation that does not actually exist: non-metropolitan England and parts of English-speaking Wales. And it is purchased at the very high price of creating much deeper divisions between England-without-London and the rest of the British-Irish archipelago.</p> <p>There is a particular paradox here when we think back on that great Brexit slogan: take back control. It is that the parts of the UK that have actually \u201ctaken back control\u201d into their own local democratic institutions reject Brexit; while the parts that support Brexit have no such institutions. The Scottish parliament, the Welsh Senedd and the Northern Ireland assembly have all voted overwhelmingly in recent weeks to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-51181641\" title=\"\">reject the withdrawal agreement</a>. (Their votes will of course be ignored by the government in London.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e04a35b46602469acb6335926e72cdbb230c957c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e04a35b46602469acb6335926e72cdbb230c957c/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacob Rees-Mogg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Brexit has to present itself in these terms: a suppressed people rising up, as Jacob Rees-Mogg puts it, to set itself \u2018free of the heavy yoke of the European Union\u2019.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the voters in England who actually want Brexit are not recognised at all as a \u201cpeople\u201d with a voice of their own. They are nationalist revolutionaries without a political nation. They are creating a country for themselves, but it is one that dare not speak its name.</p> <p>At the heart of this dilemma is the illusion that a fragile multinational state can play with the fire of nationalism yet not get burned. The allure of leaving a larger multinational political entity and going your own way is very potent. But once you establish it as the core value of politics, where do you stop? Brexit sets in motion the logic that shared sovereignty is unnatural and that all \u201cpeoples\u201d must return to the pure dominion of their ancient nations.</p> <p>However, it then commands the tide of separatism to stop at the current borders of the UK. It dictates that the nation must take back control of its own fate in order to inaugurate for itself what Johnson and Rees-Mogg unblushingly hail as a \u201cgolden age\u201d. But apparently the only nation that is supposed to hear this thrilling call of destiny is the new England that has been conjured into being. You would need to be half blind on scrumpy not to see the fatal contradiction.</p> <p>\u2022 Fintan O\u2019Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times</p>",

Brexit has to present itself in these terms: a suppressed people rising up, as Jacob Rees-Mogg puts it, to set itself \u201cfree of the heavy yoke of the European Union\u201d. But here there is a great irony: Britain is not and never has been a nation state. For most of its history as a state, it has been at the heart not of a national polity, but of a vast multinational and polyglot empire. And the UK is itself a four-nation amalgam of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There is no single pre-EU UK \u201cnation\u201d to return to. There is no unified \u201cpeople\u201d to whom power is being returned. And this is the contradiction that the Brexit project cannot even acknowledge, let alone resolve. Scotland and Northern Ireland rejected Brexit even more emphatically in the general election of 2019 than they had done in the referendum of 2016 and a clear majority of voters in the UK as a whole voted in 2019 for parties that promised a second referendum and an opportunity to stay in the EU. So while Johnson likes to talk of 31 January as \u201cthis pivotal moment in our national story\u201d, there is neither a settled nation nor a shared story. Brexit is not Northern Ireland\u2019s story. It is not Scotland\u2019s story. It is not even London\u2019s story. It is the national origin myth of the place that Anthony Barnett, co-founder of openDemocracy, calls \u201cEngland without London\u201d. There is no doubt that Brexit has worked in the way that nationalist movements try to \u2013 it has united people across great divides of social class and geography in the name of a transcendent identity. Many of those people, if not quite drunk on scrumpy and bawling Brexit shanties, will feel real joy on 31 January. But the problem is that this unity of national purpose functions within a nation that does not actually exist: non-metropolitan England and parts of English-speaking Wales. And it is purchased at the very high price of creating much deeper divisions between England-without-London and the rest of the British-Irish archipelago. There is a particular paradox here when we think back on that great Brexit slogan: take back control. It is that the parts of the UK that have actually \u201ctaken back control\u201d into their own local democratic institutions reject Brexit; while the parts that support Brexit have no such institutions. The Scottish parliament, the Welsh Senedd and the Northern Ireland assembly have all voted overwhelmingly in recent weeks to reject the withdrawal agreement. (Their votes will of course be ignored by the government in London.) But the voters in England who actually want Brexit are not recognised at all as a \u201cpeople\u201d with a voice of their own. They are nationalist revolutionaries without a political nation. They are creating a country for themselves, but it is one that dare not speak its name. At the heart of this dilemma is the illusion that a fragile multinational state can play with the fire of nationalism yet not get burned. The allure of leaving a larger multinational political entity and going your own way is very potent. But once you establish it as the core value of politics, where do you stop? Brexit sets in motion the logic that shared sovereignty is unnatural and that all \u201cpeoples\u201d must return to the pure dominion of their ancient nations. However, it then commands the tide of separatism to stop at the current borders of the UK. It dictates that the nation must take back control of its own fate in order to inaugurate for itself what Johnson and Rees-Mogg unblushingly hail as a \u201cgolden age\u201d. But apparently the only nation that is supposed to hear this thrilling call of destiny is the new England that has been conjured into being. You would need to be half blind on scrumpy not to see the fatal contradiction. \u2022 Fintan O\u2019Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times",

I don\u2019t know many places in the world where people are showing this leadership on the issue of antisemitism right now, and that is the main problem.\u201d Last month, Lauder accompanied Angela Merkel on her first visit to Auschwitz since becoming German chancellor 15 years ago. \u201cI won\u2019t discuss what we talked about, but I think one of the reasons [for her visit] is what is happening in Germany now,\u201d he said, referring to the rise in antisemitic attacks in recent years. After a far-right attack on a synagogue in Halle in October, in which two people died, Lauder visited the city. \u201cI asked myself: who is taking responsibility? Is it the chancellor? I don\u2019t see who is doing that in Germany, or the UK,\u201d Lauder said. \u201cGermany has done a lousy job dealing with its past because they have not taught about Auschwitz and what really happened there.\u201d Lauder, the son of the late Est\u00e9e Lauder, founder of the eponymous cosmetic empire, has been president of the WJC since 2007. He was sent by Ronald Reagan to Austria as US ambassador but resigned in 1987 after 18 months in protest at the election of Kurt Waldheim as Austrian president, despite the revelation that he had been a Nazi intelligence officer. That episode made Lauder more aware of his Jewish heritage and gave him the impetus to visit Auschwitz for the first time. \u201cI always thank Kurt Waldheim for making me a Jew,\u201d he said. \u201cI came [to Vienna] as an assimilated Jew, and when I left I was a Jew who was much more aware.\u201d Having witnessed the disintegration of the Auschwitz memorial site, Lauder, 765, established conservation laboratories to preserve the evidence of the Nazi murder of 1.1 million Jews carried out there. \u201cWhen I first arrived there, the hair was disintegrating, the leather suitcases and shoes were falling apart. I said at this rate there\u2019ll soon be nothing left, so we raised $40m and set up the laboratories.\u201d Experts from the Egyptian wing of New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art helped establish the preservation methods, which continue to keep a team of conservators busy in a full-time operation. \u201cWhen you go there you see people working on everything from hair to shoes to paintwork, to bricks, wood and barbed wire that\u2019s falling apart \u2026 It\u2019s probably the only place of all the Nazi concentration and extermination camps where you still have a sense of what it was like.",

      "bodyText": "Even by the aesthetic standards of some rural property developments, the one planned at Loch Long in Argyll and Bute is startlingly nondescript. The site is accessed through virgin woodlands which provide shelter to endangered and protected species, including European long-eared bats, pine martens and tawny owls. This brings you out to the shoreline and a stunning vision across one of Scotland\u2019s grandest sea lochs that hasn\u2019t changed with the passing of aeons and is a designated area of panoramic quality. The tiny hamlet of Portincaple, which sits alongside Loch Long, is facing the prospect of seeing its population of 120 doubled by a luxury housing and hotel project described by local people as \u201can aggressive major development\u201d. Christine Pratt, along with most other residents, is aghast at the plans. \u201cWe feel this development typifies the threat to Scotland\u2019s rural communities and its biodiversity by developers and local authorities. Many of these run contrary to local development plans. Already about 100 trees have been felled to make way for this in an area which is home to many protected and at-risk species,\u201d she said. The housing and hotel proposal comes from Pelham Olive, an entrepreneur who already owns a leisure development on the other side of Loch Long. Scotland has witnessed a slew of these developments in recent years. Donald Trump managed to overcome intense local opposition to build a luxury golf course on the Aberdeenshire coast that has already damaged the site\u2019s rare dune system. A few miles along the same coastal stretch, another exclusive golf facility is being planned by a rival US billionaire developer. The battle over Loch Long comes a few months after plans to build a Flamingo Land on the shores of nearby Loch Lomond were defeated due to an international outcry. Earlier last year controversial proposals to build luxury homes on Culloden Moor, site of the last land battle fought in Britain, were waved through. Most of Portincaple\u2019s residents fear that lax and inconsistent planning regulations across Scotland give encouragement to global entrepreneurs looking to cash in on the country\u2019s natural beauty. They also feel that Scotland is becoming a development Klondyke for rich prospectors. The launch of their official campaign, Save Loch Long, Protect Portincaple, last week has achieved something rare in Scottish politics: genuine cross-party consensus. Representatives of Labour, the Conservatives and Scottish Greens all attended while the SNP have also pledged to back the campaign.

Palin was particularly sweet to him \u2013 you could sense there was a strong bond between them even if Jones could no longer articulate his feelings.

So there is some uplift there.\u201d</p> <p>Palin, he told McKie, was a frequent visitor to Jones\u2019s home. \u201cThe thing that struck me was how Terry reacted to his diagnosis [of dementia],\u201d said Palin. \u201cHe was very matter-of-fact about it and would stop people in the street and tell them: \u2018I\u2019ve got dementia, you know.

He occasionally lurches from the real world into twitterdom and has been \u2026 disliked, I\u2019ll not put it more strongly \u2026 for venturing that humour cannot be patrolled by politics. His simple idea was that if something\u2019s funny weird gloopy nasty \u2013 who among us have the right to define wit?</p> <p>As the TV critic for the <em>Observer </em>I observe much which is not wit. Much of TV \u201chumour\u201d is clever boys and girls playing to themselves: occasionally, an absolute standout fireball gem. As a Radio 4 listener, I\u2019ve stopped; the \u201chumour\u201d is so relentlessly, stultifyingly anti-Tory.</p> <p>Terry Jones\u2019s love was always a love of rough balance. Tolerance: even of stupidity. The Very Big Corporation Of America, a wonderfully stylised (by Jones) part of the <em>Meaning of Life, </em>features angry bohos in suits arguing how precisely much there was left of the globe to own. Item 6 is \u201cthe meaning of life\u201d. And the answer comes: \u201c1, people are not wearing enough hats. 2, matter is energy. In the universe, however, the soul does not exist <em>ab initio</em> as Orthodox Christianity teaches, it has to be brought into existence by a process of guided self-observation \u2026 flawed owing to man\u2019s ability to be distracted by everyday trivia.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>Nicobobinus</em>, there\u2019s this. \u201cIn fact, only his best friend, Rosie, knew he could, and nobody took any notice of anything Rosie said, because she was always having wild ideas anyway.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a strong suspicion that Jones was always more Rosie than Nicobobinus.</p> <p>Or, as Terry queried urgently, in a bossy American accent, and for once in button-down Brooks Brothers tie rather than floral maudlin frumpery, at the end of The Very Big Corporation Of America, where every Python was of rigid-faceted visage, bedecked as Masters of the Universe: \u201cWhat was that about hats again?\u201d</p> <h2>Terry\u2019s greatest moments</h2> <h2> <br></h2> <p><strong>Mr Creosote</strong></p> <p>\u201cBetter,\u201d says Mr Creosote, roiling into view at the start of the restaurant scene in <em>The Meaning of Life.<strong> </strong></em>It answers John Cleese\u2019s oleaginous waiter\u2019s, \u201cgood afternoon m\u2019sieur, and \u2019ow are we today?\u201d But Jones swiftly amends it to \u201cBetter get a bucket, I\u2019m going to throw up.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Mandy Cohen</strong></p> <p>From <em>Life of Brian</em> comes this exchange between the \u201cwise men\u201d responsible for the worst case of mistaken identity in cinematic history, with Jones as Mandy Cohen, Brian\u2019s mother.</p> <p>Mandy: \u201cSo what star sign is he?\u201d</p> <p>Wise Man#2: \u201cHmm \u2026 Capricorn.\u201d</p> <p>Mandy: \u201cCapricorn, eh? What are they like?\u201d</p> <p>WM2: \u201cLike? Oh, but \u2026 He is the son of God! Our Messiah!\u201d</p> <p>WM1: \u201cKing of the Jews!\u201d</p> <p>Mandy: \u201cAnd that\u2019s Capricorn, is it?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Sir Bedevere</strong></p> <p>Jones in <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em>, has \u201cestablished\u201d that witches burn because they\u2019re made of wood. And wood floats. And what also floats? (\u201cGravy! Very small rocks! Lead!\u201d shout the villagers). No, a duck. If she weighs the same as a duck, she\u2019s made of wood. \u201cAnd therefore \u2026?\u201d A witch! A witch!</p> <p>That little \u2026 \u201cand therefore\u201d sums up Jones\u2019s attitude to the usurping of logic for political/religious ends.</p> <p><strong>The Squire</strong></p> <p>Eric Idle, as the cravated, loathsome Arthur Nudge, is invading Jones\u2019s space and enquiring of the \u201csquire\u201d \u2013 \u201cI bet, I bet your wife\u2019s been \u2026 around. Been around a bit, eh? Know what I mean?\u201d</p> <p>Jones: \u201cYes, I suppose she\u2019s \u2026 travelled a bit. She\u2019s from Purley.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Arthur \u2018Two Sheds\u2019 Jackson</strong></p> <p>On the Pythons\u2019 It\u2019s the Arts show Jones is being interviewed by Idle, as \u201cone of the foremost composers of our times\u201d.</p> <p>Jackson has somehow come by the sobriquet of \u201cTwo Sheds\u201d</p> <p>Idle: \u201cI see, I see. And you\u2019re thinking of buying this second shed to write in!\u201d</p> <p>Jones: \u201cNo, no. Look. This shed business \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter. The sheds <em>aren\u2019t important</em>. I wish you\u2019d ask me about the music. \u2026 I\u2019m going to get rid of the shed. I\u2019m fed up with it!\u201d</p> <p>Idle: \u201cThen you\u2019ll be Arthur \u2018No Sheds\u2019 Jackson, eh?\u201d</p>",

As a Radio 4 listener, I\u2019ve stopped; the \u201chumour\u201d is so relentlessly, stultifyingly anti-Tory. Terry Jones\u2019s love was always a love of rough balance. Tolerance: even of stupidity. The Very Big Corporation Of America, a wonderfully stylised (by Jones) part of the Meaning of Life, features angry bohos in suits arguing how precisely much there was left of the globe to own. Item 6 is \u201cthe meaning of life\u201d. And the answer comes: \u201c1, people are not wearing enough hats. 2, matter is energy. In the universe, however, the soul does not exist ab initio as Orthodox Christianity teaches, it has to be brought into existence by a process of guided self-observation \u2026 flawed owing to man\u2019s ability to be distracted by everyday trivia.\u201d In Nicobobinus, there\u2019s this. \u201cIn fact, only his best friend, Rosie, knew he could, and nobody took any notice of anything Rosie said, because she was always having wild ideas anyway.\u201d There\u2019s a strong suspicion that Jones was always more Rosie than Nicobobinus. Or, as Terry queried urgently, in a bossy American accent, and for once in button-down Brooks Brothers tie rather than floral maudlin frumpery, at the end of The Very Big Corporation Of America, where every Python was of rigid-faceted visage, bedecked as Masters of the Universe: \u201cWhat was that about hats again?\u201d Terry\u2019s greatest moments Mr Creosote \u201cBetter,\u201d says Mr Creosote, roiling into view at the start of the restaurant scene in The Meaning of Life. It answers John Cleese\u2019s oleaginous waiter\u2019s, \u201cgood afternoon m\u2019sieur, and \u2019ow are we today?\u201d But Jones swiftly amends it to \u201cBetter get a bucket, I\u2019m going to throw up.\u201d Mandy Cohen From Life of Brian comes this exchange between the \u201cwise men\u201d responsible for the worst case of mistaken identity in cinematic history, with Jones as Mandy Cohen, Brian\u2019s mother. Mandy: \u201cSo what star sign is he?\u201d Wise Man#2: \u201cHmm \u2026 Capricorn.\u201d Mandy: \u201cCapricorn, eh? What are they like?\u201d WM2: \u201cLike? Oh, but \u2026 He is the son of God! Our Messiah!\u201d WM1: \u201cKing of the Jews!\u201d Mandy: \u201cAnd that\u2019s Capricorn, is it?\u201d Sir Bedevere Jones in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, has \u201cestablished\u201d that witches burn because they\u2019re made of wood. And wood floats. And what also floats? (\u201cGravy! Very small rocks! Lead!\u201d shout the villagers). No, a duck. If she weighs the same as a duck, she\u2019s made of wood. \u201cAnd therefore \u2026?\u201d A witch! A witch! That little \u2026 \u201cand therefore\u201d sums up Jones\u2019s attitude to the usurping of logic for political/religious ends. The Squire Eric Idle, as the cravated, loathsome Arthur Nudge, is invading Jones\u2019s space and enquiring of the \u201csquire\u201d \u2013 \u201cI bet, I bet your wife\u2019s been \u2026 around. Been around a bit, eh? Know what I mean?\u201d Jones: \u201cYes, I suppose she\u2019s \u2026 travelled a bit. She\u2019s from Purley.\u201d Arthur \u2018Two Sheds\u2019 Jackson On the Pythons\u2019 It\u2019s the Arts show Jones is being interviewed by Idle, as \u201cone of the foremost composers of our times\u201d. Jackson has somehow come by the sobriquet of \u201cTwo Sheds\u201d Idle: \u201cI see, I see. And you\u2019re thinking of buying this second shed to write in!\u201d Jones: \u201cNo, no. Look. This shed business \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter. The sheds aren\u2019t important. I wish you\u2019d ask me about the music. \u2026 I\u2019m going to get rid of the shed. I\u2019m fed up with it!\u201d Idle: \u201cThen you\u2019ll be Arthur \u2018No Sheds\u2019 Jackson, eh?\u201d",

But, no. The streets were preternaturally quiet.</p> <p>In a branch of Whole Foods, a customer poked, as if in slow motion, at a bowl of kale.

Stepping outside my hotel, I expected to be met by wild crowds of journalists, lawyers and politicians, all desperately fanning themselves with copies of The Hill and Politico (the verbiage that pours out of DC on a daily basis must be seen to be believed). But, no. The streets were preternaturally quiet. In a branch of Whole Foods, a customer poked, as if in slow motion, at a bowl of kale. In the National Gallery of Art shop, an assistant with no customers assiduously rearranged merchandise.

It\u2019s incredible we\u2019ve got to this point not knowing what we are voting for. I\u2019ve no reason to want to leave the EU, I think it\u2019s done a lot for us.

When I was 13 I stayed with host families in London and Newcastle and loved it \u2013 that\u2019s when I learned to speak English.

There are so many benefits to being in the EU, more benefits I believe than negatives. I travel a lot and this is the most important bit for me, being able to travel back and forth in Europe.

We\u2019ve had the longest period of peace in Europe in human history and that\u2019s the main driver for us being a union. Our economic union isn\u2019t perfect, but we can\u2019t make changes when we\u2019ve left. Brexit has been imposed on us by the will of a minority elite. It\u2019s taking us towards an autocracy and plutocracy. I abhor the idea of a transatlantic trade deal with Mr Trump. It\u2019s not just about chlorinated chicken. Having worked in the NHS for years, central to my concerns are fears of privatisation. I feel I\u2019m a European. I come from a family of immigrants. I see free movement as being a safe opportunity both ways.

      "bodyText": "I am taking the 8.55am Eurostar train from London to Amsterdam via Brussels on a foggy morning in the last days before the UK leaves the European Union. Are people sad about the UK leaving? Happy? Relieved? What will they miss about being in Europe on a personal and general level? Why do people think it didn\u2019t work out as regards remaining in the EU? Has Brexit changed people\u2019s views of Britain? What is Britain losing? I spoke to people of a variety of ages and nationalities, from a 20-year-old Belgian man to an 82-year-old British woman. I spoke to an Austrian, an Australian, an American, Japanese citizens, to Remainers and those who voted Leave. At the Eurostar check-in at St Pancras, I meet the first of my interviewees, a young woman of Austrian nationality living in London and concerned about not being able to travel so easily between Britain and European countries. Indeed, many of the people I spoke to listed this curtailed freedom of movement as a key fear. I had apprehensions about potentially grumpy passengers being unwilling to be interviewed, but most of those I approached were eager to talk, as if a valve had been released \u2013 indeed one, Derek Gould described it as his \u201cpent-up rant for the last three-years\u201d. Many shared the sense of a shifting identity on an individual and national level \u2013 about who we are, where we are going and what we might become. On my return from Amsterdam, I see symbols of Britain while entering the Eurostar terminal at Brussels: a giant ornate teapot on see-through sliding doors leading into the building (the teapot splits in two when the doors open), and a huge red telephone box saying \u201cTHIS IS GREAT Britain\u201d with \u201cGREAT\u201d highlighted in a red box and Britain demoted to a tiny font. Will Britain still be so \u201cgreat\u201d after 31 January? The evening train journey back is more subdued, and soon after I mention the word \u201cBrexit\u201d a baby near me throws up. I speak to a young woman who is returning from a three-day trip she took to \u201cget away from it all\u201d, and she shares her increasing experiences of racism since the EU referendum and a sense of foreboding about the future. We both get chatting with a stranger on the seat opposite, an expat Brit living in Spain who is horrified about the situation. As the train pulls back into London, we part ways with a sense of shared sadness, yet community between us. The emotion during my conversations with strangers on these train journeys about leaving the EU was palpable: from horror to sadness to relief that the deal has been done. Above all was a sense of uncertainty about what is to come; stepping off the train back into Britain feels like \u2013 as many said \u2013 taking a giant leap into the unknown. Katerina Hadjimatheou 41, academic British, lives in London Holiday I feel devastated about leaving the European Union. I think we\u2019re going to lose opportunities and openness and the ability to be a force against China or the US, as independently I don\u2019t feel we have as much power. And I\u2019m also devastated for our kids and future generations and what their general outlook on the world will be. With this decision, we\u2019re going to go back to being inward-looking and close-minded and I\u2019m sensing that already. Howard Smart 63, consultant physician in NHS British, lives on Merseyside Holiday I\u2019m just so horrified that we voted to leave on the whim of not knowing what we are leaving for \u2013 whether because of David Cameron shoring up a divided Conservative party or otherwise. It\u2019s incredible we\u2019ve got to this point not knowing what we are voting for. I\u2019ve no reason to want to leave the EU, I think it\u2019s done a lot for us. Liverpool, my home, probably wouldn\u2019t have become European Capital of Culture if it wasn\u2019t for the EU. Hamza Denayer 20, footballer Belgian, lives in Brussels Holiday I live in Brussels but my girlfriend lives in the UK so I visit a lot. I am feeling sad about Brexit and think it will change things for the worse. I\u2019m worried about what will happen and whether I will be able to travel so easily to the UK to see my girlfriend so Brexit is affecting people\u2019s personal lives \u2013 it\u2019s not just a political thing. I would prefer the UK stays in Europe. Pam Young 62, speech and language therapist British, lives on Merseyside Holiday I\u2019m very sad about leaving mainly because of the last 70-year history of peace. I can\u2019t think of any real positives given to me by those who voted to leave. I\u2019ve come across so many European people in my work in the NHS \u2013 Italian, Spanish, French \u2013 and I just so hope they don\u2019t leave. I think they will be a big loss to us. Liverpool, where I live, is a very welcoming city and a Remainer city. But I think divisiveness and racism in the UK has increased and people are being made to feel unwelcome. Terence Cooper 72, retired railway worker British, lives in south-east London Day trip I\u2019m having a day out. I\u2019m not sure of my final destination yet \u2013 maybe Bruges. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s all finally sorted. I voted out and would vote out again but I didn\u2019t vote for all the chaos, which has annoyed and upset me. It should have been a clean break. Although I voted out, I don\u2019t think the referendum should have happened. I think it was an attempt to unite the Conservative party. I think there\u2019ll be hiccups in the transition process, but I really don\u2019t know how Britain will change. Elisa Fogiel 22, law student French, lives in Amsterdam Holiday I get upset to think about it. I consider the British to be our neighbours. What I feel is mainly sadness but maybe we have to respect what the people want. I feel sad as a European citizen. I think most of the people I talk to from Britain are young and were against Brexit. When I was 13 I stayed with host families in London and Newcastle and loved it \u2013 that\u2019s when I learned to speak English. I love the country and would love to discover it more but it may be more complicated. Some friends wanted to move there and that may be difficult. Johanna Bresnik 24, works in sports sales Austrian, lives in London Business trip I think it\u2019s a big mistake for Britain to be leaving the EU and I\u2019m very sad about it. There are so many benefits to being in the EU, more benefits I believe than negatives. I travel a lot and this is the most important bit for me, being able to travel back and forth in Europe. This is my biggest fear \u2013 not being able to easily do so. Also, jobwise a lot of companies will be affected. Brexit has changed my views on Britain, to the negative. Derek Gould 70, retired NHS consultant British, lives in Liverpool Holiday I\u2019m appalled. We\u2019ve had the longest period of peace in Europe in human history and that\u2019s the main driver for us being a union. Our economic union isn\u2019t perfect, but we can\u2019t make changes when we\u2019ve left. Brexit has been imposed on us by the will of a minority elite. It\u2019s taking us towards an autocracy and plutocracy. I abhor the idea of a transatlantic trade deal with Mr Trump. It\u2019s not just about chlorinated chicken. Having worked in the NHS for years, central to my concerns are fears of privatisation. I feel I\u2019m a European. I come from a family of immigrants. I see free movement as being a safe opportunity both ways. This has been my pent-up rant for the last three years. Janis Champa 57, freelance British, lives near Granada, Spain Visiting family I\u2019m absolutely furious about it. I can\u2019t understand why we\u2019re doing something that\u2019s going to be so hurtful. It\u2019s mainly about racism I think, and that disgusts me. I\u2019m very concerned about what has been legitimised by Brexit. I travel through Europe a lot, and I don\u2019t know what will happen, whether I will lose my house or living. I get hopping mad about it \u2013 I think it\u2019s self-harming. From the minute we leave, I will lobby to rejoin. Eugene Hammond 28, director of a coffee company British, lives in London Going to see a health specialist It isn\u2019t quite clear what exactly is happening. I feel it\u2019s going to get worse for the people who are in the worst social and economic quota. Inflation is going to happen. People my age are still going to be stuck in their parents\u2019 houses, arguing with their parents. I think it\u2019s happened because of greed, manipulation, and austerity. Britain is losing respect, credibility and trust. Even our royals are leaving. Nanako Mochizuki/ Ayako Mizuochi 31, salesperson; 28, TV assistant Japanese, live in London Holiday This is not affecting us personally but affecting many of our friends as so many Japanese live and work in London and the structure of companies is changing because of it. We\u2019re two friends and going to visit Brussels for the first time and are hoping to travel more \u2013 and hoping Brexit won\u2019t affect that. We\u2019ll spend our time eating, shopping and drinking \u2013 and trying to forget about Brexit. Steve Yarnell 59, enterprise director in logistics and distribution British, lives in Saffron Walden Business trip I\u2019m happy now the deal is done. I was on the fence as to whether it was a good idea or bad idea but now it\u2019s done it\u2019s a relief. I\u2019m feeling positive about it and feel we should just move forward and enhance the position we are in. We have to look for the positive, move forward and make the best of whatever we do. I think the biggest fear for business is that we lose the freedom to trade freely. Francine Ahade 60, accountant French, lives in Lille Holiday I\u2019m not sad about Brexit. For me, it\u2019s not a bad thing. It\u2019s good for Great Britain and Europe making them stronger. It will be a good transaction between France and Britain and was what the people wanted. I\u2019m not happy about it, but also not sad. I\u2019m going home to Lille today. I enjoy visiting London \u2013 my 26-year-old daughter lives there. She\u2019s very happy living in London and also not sad about Brexit. Michele Taylor 50, retired American, lives in Phoenix, Arizona Holiday Most people in the US are more concerned with what\u2019s going on with Prince Harry rather than Brexit, I think, and we have our own internal problems too. But I have a different view and care more because I have European descent. I think it\u2019s like California wanting to be its own entity. I\u2019m watching the Vikings series at the moment and it\u2019s reminding me of that. I think the pound will be expensive and it will have a big effect on the economy. And I think people may use Paris more than London as a new posting for them. Bruce Edmonds 59, academic British, lives between Sheffield and Manchester Business trip As to what my identity is, I\u2019d say I\u2019m a European academic, so it\u2019s directly damaged my sense of who I am. I think we will have lost that feeling of being European. I\u2019m sad about it for sure. A lot of our research is done in joint European projects and if we do become disconnected from that, that will be a big loss. I think discontentment from the [financial] crash fed underlying resentment, including to politicians. It has damaged my view of what Britain was \u2013 an open country collaborating with people. I think Britain will stop being such a great nation. Devi Thakrar 25, hospitality manager British, lives in London Holiday I\u2019m really sad \u2013 it\u2019s going to be harder to travel and I love travelling in Europe; I\u2019ve just been on a three-day trip to get away from it all. Will we need visas or not? I\u2019m concerned for whether racism will go up, as it\u2019s already at a level where it\u2019s affecting a lot of people\u2019s lives, including mine. I\u2019ve experienced a lot of racism, including in Cornwall. A guy said we were holding up traffic and called the police on us. These things play on your mind. Katharine Hoskyns 82, retired British, lives in London Visiting daughter in France I\u2019ll miss being able to pop over very easily without worrying about visas. It\u2019s great being able to use the phone regularly to speak with my daughter and I\u2019m worried about increased rates to call Europe. I remember when we became part of Europe after the war and there was a lot of hope about it. I think bad governance made this happen. Britain has changed, and become a divided nation, more extreme. I think all the prices will go up, there\u2019ll be unemployment and the people who voted out of Europe will be regretting it. Suresh Rajalingam 46, IT sales Australian, lives in Sydney Business trip I work for a company which is Brussels-based. It\u2019s painful for a lot of companies who are having to restructure and leave their London branch. It\u2019s confusing and disrupting. I think they should have exited long ago. Aussies like to make jokes of \u201cpommies\u201d a lot and more so with the Brexit chaos \u2013 they think it\u2019s typical British that they couldn\u2019t sort this out without chaos. A lot of people travel to the UK from Australia and now there\u2019s more uncertainty on the impact on travel. Gavin Avery 48, works in fashion British, lives between Shoreditch and Brussels Business trip I will miss a lot about being in the EU\u2013 including the sense of commonality and community with Europe. I work in Europe and will miss the seamless ability to go from one to the other. I will miss frictionless work and travel. I am sad, for sure. I think a lot of people felt discontented which led to this. My view of Britain has dramatically changed. I think Britain is becoming more parochial and losing encompassing vision. Elisa dos Santos 39, housewife Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil Holiday I\u2019ve just been on holiday in London. I\u2019m from Brazil and next I\u2019m going to Amsterdam and then Paris. Everyone I know who comes to London loves the city and people; there are so many different things to see. We have beaches in Brazil but the UK has Windsor castle. I love Windsor castle and I love visiting. I love Prince Harry. I don\u2019t feel sad about Brexit. It will be a good thing. We talk about Brexit a bit in Brazil and some people don\u2019t like it but to be honest people are more interested in Prince Harry.",

The retired engineer, who worked in the US, Brazil and the UK, likes the Indiana mayor\u2019s youth, is impressed by his ability to speak eight languages, including Norwegian and Dari, and calls him a natural leader. But he has had to set one issue aside.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a homophobe,\u201d said Pinneke after attending a Buttigieg rally in Ankeny, Iowa, as campaigning in the first vote to select the Democratic presidential candidate heads into the final stretch before the state\u2019s caucus on 3 February. \u201cI get around gay people, that isn\u2019t the world that I grew up in and it bothers me.\u201d</p> <p>Pinneke, 71, said he will vote for the gay military veteran despite his own prejudice, although he flinches at the thought of a President Buttigieg with his husband, Chasten, as First Gentleman.</p> <p>\u201cI grapple with that. But so what? Does it hurt anybody? I haven\u2019t seen it. So why is that an issue for me? Is it because I\u2019m an old son-of-a-gun and I didn\u2019t grow up that way? That\u2019s not a good reason not to vote for him,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Pinneke is not alone in wondering if others might fail to set their prejudices aside, and whether that makes Buttigieg, a 38-year-old Harvard graduate, Rhodes scholar and former US navy intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan, a risky bet as a presidential candidate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c0bf863dee4e2378f30f1d7204aaf9fa6fb33cae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0bf863dee4e2378f30f1d7204aaf9fa6fb33cae/806_0_2419_3024/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jerry Pinneke.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jerry Pinneke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGreal/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The South Bend mayor has blazed an impressive streak into the Democratic primaries as an unknown from a small midwestern city. When campaigning kicked off last year, the mantle of youthful upstart was held by the Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, who arrived in Iowa bolstered by nearly snatching Ted Cruz\u2019s seat in the US Senate. But O\u2019Rourke quickly burned out, as voters were turned off by a lack of substance behind the show.</p> <p>In contrast, Buttigieg\u2019s relentless campaigning won over voters, with his upbeat message, military background and, for some, his religious faith. He positioned himself as a more youthful Joe Biden in favour of incremental change in contrast to the more radical platforms of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. His star climbed and so did his poll numbers until, by November, Buttigieg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/17/pete-buttigieg-iowa-poll-surges-ahead\" title=\"\">was the frontrunner in Iowa</a>. But since then, he has fallen back, as voters focus on the fraught question of who is the best candidate to beat Trump.</p> <p>A CNN poll last week showed all four of the leading Iowa candidates beating Trump in the general election, but Buttigieg was ahead by the slimmest margin. In Iowa, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/18/pete-buttigieg-iowa-conservative-election-2020\" title=\"\">remains very much in contention,</a> within a percentage point of Sanders and Warren. But nationally he trails his main rivals badly.</p> <p>Debates about electability have flared up periodically in American history. The political establishment questioned if a Catholic could win the White House when John F Kennedy ran in 1960. Barack Obama\u2019s campaign was accompanied by plenty of speculation as to whether the US was ready for its first black president, a question answered decisively by the voters.</p> <p>This month\u2019s bitter confrontation in a televised debate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jan/14/democratic-debate-live-news-tonight-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-biden-latest-updates-2020\" title=\"\">over what Sanders said to Warren in private</a> about the prospects for a woman to be elected president revived chatter over whether gender is an additional obstacle. Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat of Donald Trump by nearly 3 million in the popular vote, only to be robbed of the presidency by the vagaries of the electoral college, would say not.</p> <p>The issue hasn\u2019t entirely been laid to rest. Warren has faced questions from women at her rallies about whether her gender will be a disadvantage, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/23/hillary-clinton-book-what-happened-trump-creep\" title=\"\">Trump stalking the debate stage</a>.</p> <p>Buttigieg\u2019s sexuality is a more awkward question for some Democrats. They do not want to feed prejudice at a time when the US is more tolerant toward the LGBTQ community than ever. Support for same-sex marriage has flipped from two-to-one against 15 years ago to the reverse today. As attitudes have evolved, institutions have followed, from the scrapping of the prohibition on publicly identifying as LGBTQ in the military to the supreme court\u2019s ruling in favour of marriage equality.</p> <p>But for those calculating who would be the best candidate to get the man they regard as the worst president of modern times out of the White House, there is a nagging fear that Buttigieg\u2019s sexuality could cost him votes if he were the candidate, and let Trump back in.</p> <p>Only half of American voters said they were ready for a gay president, according to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/30/pete-buttigieg-gay-president-poll-061350\" title=\"\">a poll for Politico in October</a>. Just a quarter of voters thought their neighbours would support a LGBTQ president \u2013 a statistic that feeds into concerns among some Democratic primary voters that, while they personally have no problem with Buttigieg, others might. That in turn makes voters like Janet Jalbert nervous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"42ae73252b9d5df8e9dfb974dec891d80adabb3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42ae73252b9d5df8e9dfb974dec891d80adabb3c/0_126_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Janet Jalbert.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Janet Jalbert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGreal/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think we would have more trouble right now accepting a gay man and having a First Gentleman in the White House than we would a woman president,\u201d said Jalbert, a post office worker and undecided voter, at a Warren rally. \u201cBetween Warren and Buttigieg, I would go with Pete. However, I believe Elizabeth probably has a stronger chance just because of the way the world is right now. Old-school people. And that\u2019s the only thing he has going against him. It\u2019s not his sexuality. It\u2019s people with closed minds.\u201d</p> <p>Jalbert said the concern that Buttigieg\u2019s sexuality might diminish the anti-Trump vote was enough for her to shy away from supporting him.</p> <p>\u201cNow, if he were to become vice president, I think that would be a great way to get him in there. And then people could see what it was all about,\u201d she said.</p> <p>At a Sanders rally the following day, Ashly Moore, an occupational therapist, expressed a similar sentiment. \u201cI like Pete but I do have concerns that he could not be as electable because of who he loves,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Last July, that concern was reinforced by the findings of a focus group of black Democratic primary voters in South Carolina, questioned for the Buttigieg campaign. He does poorly in the south in general but particularly among African Americans.</p> <p>\u201cBeing gay was a barrier for these voters, particularly for the men who seemed uncomfortable even discussing it,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/431372932/South-Carolina-Focus-Groups-Findings#from_embed\" title=\"\">said the report</a> leaked to the <em>State</em> newspaper in Columbia, South Carolina.</p> <p>The report said that was not necessarily a red line to voting for him \u201cbut their preference is for his sexuality to not be front and center\u201d.</p> <p>One man told the focus group: \u201cI\u2019ll go ahead and say it. I don\u2019t like the fact that he threw out there that he lives with his husband.\u201d A woman described Buttigieg speaking about Chasten as \u201ctoo much information\u201d.</p> <p>Johnnie Cordero, the chair of the black caucus for South Carolina Democrats, told the <em>New York Times</em> that he met Buttigieg to discuss the issue. \u201cTo be honest with you, it\u2019s going to be a problem. I know he knows that because we\u2019ve discussed it,\u201d Cordero said. \u201cMy advice to him was, don\u2019t flaunt it.\u201d</p> <p>Still, some supporters of rival candidates do not think it is an issue. At the Warren rally, Dylan Baker said the question of sexuality and electability had come up in family discussions.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s a Democrat. He\u2019s leaning to Biden but he also really likes Pete Buttigieg and we were talking about this question of electability and I was saying him being gay will not affect people\u2019s voting. He said: \u2018Oh, yeah, I forgot he was gay.\u2019\u201d Baker paused and then added: \u201cBut maybe that will affect things. We\u2019re never past those sorts of things.\u201d</p> <p>Buttigieg has sought to defuse the issue with some black voters who oppose same-sex marriage on religious grounds by drawing parallels between the struggle for gay rights and the challenges facing other minorities. He has also said that once people get to know him they will get over the fact that he is married to a man, an assertion borne out by the focus-group report, which noted that \u201cafter seeing the mayor speak, most voters \u2026 seemed to be able to get past his sexual orientation\u201d.</p> <p>Bob Sohm, a Buttigieg supporter at a rally in Sioux City, Iowa, agreed with that. \u201cPeople have their prejudices but it can be done. We\u2019ve never elected a black president until now. It\u2019s got to start somewhere.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s just people need to be more educated about him and know his policies, and maybe think \u2018I can start to consider this guy because maybe he can win\u2019.\u201d</p>",

But Pinneke is not alone in wondering if others might fail to set their prejudices aside, and whether that makes Buttigieg, a 38-year-old Harvard graduate, Rhodes scholar and former US navy intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan, a risky bet as a presidential candidate. The South Bend mayor has blazed an impressive streak into the Democratic primaries as an unknown from a small midwestern city. When campaigning kicked off last year, the mantle of youthful upstart was held by the Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, who arrived in Iowa bolstered by nearly snatching Ted Cruz\u2019s seat in the US Senate. But O\u2019Rourke quickly burned out, as voters were turned off by a lack of substance behind the show. In contrast, Buttigieg\u2019s relentless campaigning won over voters, with his upbeat message, military background and, for some, his religious faith. He positioned himself as a more youthful Joe Biden in favour of incremental change in contrast to the more radical platforms of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. His star climbed and so did his poll numbers until, by November, Buttigieg was the frontrunner in Iowa. But since then, he has fallen back, as voters focus on the fraught question of who is the best candidate to beat Trump. A CNN poll last week showed all four of the leading Iowa candidates beating Trump in the general election, but Buttigieg was ahead by the slimmest margin. In Iowa, he remains very much in contention, within a percentage point of Sanders and Warren. But nationally he trails his main rivals badly. Debates about electability have flared up periodically in American history. The political establishment questioned if a Catholic could win the White House when John F Kennedy ran in 1960. Barack Obama\u2019s campaign was accompanied by plenty of speculation as to whether the US was ready for its first black president, a question answered decisively by the voters. This month\u2019s bitter confrontation in a televised debate over what Sanders said to Warren in private about the prospects for a woman to be elected president revived chatter over whether gender is an additional obstacle. Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat of Donald Trump by nearly 3 million in the popular vote, only to be robbed of the presidency by the vagaries of the electoral college, would say not. The issue hasn\u2019t entirely been laid to rest. Warren has faced questions from women at her rallies about whether her gender will be a disadvantage, with Trump stalking the debate stage. Buttigieg\u2019s sexuality is a more awkward question for some Democrats. They do not want to feed prejudice at a time when the US is more tolerant toward the LGBTQ community than ever. Support for same-sex marriage has flipped from two-to-one against 15 years ago to the reverse today. As attitudes have evolved, institutions have followed, from the scrapping of the prohibition on publicly identifying as LGBTQ in the military to the supreme court\u2019s ruling in favour of marriage equality. But for those calculating who would be the best candidate to get the man they regard as the worst president of modern times out of the White House, there is a nagging fear that Buttigieg\u2019s sexuality could cost him votes if he were the candidate, and let Trump back in. Only half of American voters said they were ready for a gay president, according to a poll for Politico in October. Just a quarter of voters thought their neighbours would support a LGBTQ president \u2013 a statistic that feeds into concerns among some Democratic primary voters that, while they personally have no problem with Buttigieg, others might. That in turn makes voters like Janet Jalbert nervous. \u201cI think we would have more trouble right now accepting a gay man and having a First Gentleman in the White House than we would a woman president,\u201d said Jalbert, a post office worker and undecided voter, at a Warren rally. \u201cBetween Warren and Buttigieg, I would go with Pete. However, I believe Elizabeth probably has a stronger chance just because of the way the world is right now. Old-school people. And that\u2019s the only thing he has going against him. It\u2019s not his sexuality. It\u2019s people with closed minds.\u201d Jalbert said the concern that Buttigieg\u2019s sexuality might diminish the anti-Trump vote was enough for her to shy away from supporting him. \u201cNow, if he were to become vice president, I think that would be a great way to get him in there. And then people could see what it was all about,\u201d she said. At a Sanders rally the following day, Ashly Moore, an occupational therapist, expressed a similar sentiment. \u201cI like Pete but I do have concerns that he could not be as electable because of who he loves,\u201d she said. Last July, that concern was reinforced by the findings of a focus group of black Democratic primary voters in South Carolina, questioned for the Buttigieg campaign. He does poorly in the south in general but particularly among African Americans. \u201cBeing gay was a barrier for these voters, particularly for the men who seemed uncomfortable even discussing it,\u201d said the report leaked to the State newspaper in Columbia, South Carolina. The report said that was not necessarily a red line to voting for him \u201cbut their preference is for his sexuality to not be front and center\u201d. One man told the focus group: \u201cI\u2019ll go ahead and say it. I don\u2019t like the fact that he threw out there that he lives with his husband.\u201d A woman described Buttigieg speaking about Chasten as \u201ctoo much information\u201d. Johnnie Cordero, the chair of the black caucus for South Carolina Democrats, told the New York Times that he met Buttigieg to discuss the issue. \u201cTo be honest with you, it\u2019s going to be a problem. I know he knows that because we\u2019ve discussed it,\u201d Cordero said. \u201cMy advice to him was, don\u2019t flaunt it.\u201d Still, some supporters of rival candidates do not think it is an issue. At the Warren rally, Dylan Baker said the question of sexuality and electability had come up in family discussions. \u201cMy dad\u2019s a Democrat. He\u2019s leaning to Biden but he also really likes Pete Buttigieg and we were talking about this question of electability and I was saying him being gay will not affect people\u2019s voting. He said: \u2018Oh, yeah, I forgot he was gay.\u2019\u201d Baker paused and then added: \u201cBut maybe that will affect things. We\u2019re never past those sorts of things.\u201d Buttigieg has sought to defuse the issue with some black voters who oppose same-sex marriage on religious grounds by drawing parallels between the struggle for gay rights and the challenges facing other minorities. He has also said that once people get to know him they will get over the fact that he is married to a man, an assertion borne out by the focus-group report, which noted that \u201cafter seeing the mayor speak, most voters \u2026 seemed to be able to get past his sexual orientation\u201d. Bob Sohm, a Buttigieg supporter at a rally in Sioux City, Iowa, agreed with that. \u201cPeople have their prejudices but it can be done. We\u2019ve never elected a black president until now. It\u2019s got to start somewhere. \u201cI think it\u2019s just people need to be more educated about him and know his policies, and maybe think \u2018I can start to consider this guy because maybe he can win\u2019.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The first time I interviewed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bill-nighy\" title=\"\">Bill Nighy</a> was in 2004. Sixteen years ago! He has barely changed. He is a remarkably consistent person, in taste and personality, and because of this, he seems ageless. Perhaps a little slimmer and greyer than he used to be, but that\u2019s it. His hair is styled in the same way it has been for several decades \u2013 longer on the top, slicked back from his forehead \u2013 and no matter what year, what month, what day you catch him, he will be dressed in what he calls \u201ca decent lounge suit\u201d, in navy, with appropriate shirt and shoes. Heavy-rimmed specs nestle in his pocket or on his nose.</p> <p>As familiar as his outfit is his charm. Nighy is always charming, whether to fans, an interviewer, a waiter. We meet in a hotel bar around the corner from his apartment in Piccadilly and the first thing he does is inquire about me and <em>my</em> life. And he listens to the answer: a nice trait not evident in every successful actor. He bothers to entertain \u2013 his stories are delivered well, whether they\u2019re about famous people or someone he met out and about. He still works very hard \u2013 often making four or five films a year \u2013 and he takes pleasure in his job and is happy to talk about it. In fact, the only major change in Nighy in the years I\u2019ve known him is that he is no longer with his long-term partner, Diana Quick (they separated in 2008, after 28 years together). They remain on good terms and, he tells me, they had a jolly Christmas with lots of people around the table. His daughter, Mary, is married to a Frenchman. \u201cThere were charades,\u201d he says. \u201cWe sang the Marseillaise. It was great.\u201d</p> <p>So there you have it: same as he ever was. But Nighy is far from dull. On the contrary, he\u2019s <em>unusual</em>: a very particular person with very particular tastes and habits. What he likes are clothes, music, books, football, city life. He is a modernist \u2013 \u201cI do subscribe to that ethos\u201d \u2013 with the accompanying purist attitude. He can be wildly funny about his own horror when what he considers to be the correct etiquette is not upheld. Though he\u2019s played ageing rockers on a couple of occasions, this is very much not his aesthetic. Anyway, because of all this \u2013 Nighy\u2019s style and politesse, his charisma and wit \u2013 he\u2019s often misinterpreted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"32b0ebab630d1cae74dcb57cd4d1609c43e627bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32b0ebab630d1cae74dcb57cd4d1609c43e627bc/0_427_4448_2669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Time for tea: as Mr Woodhouse in Emma.

A lounge lizard, like I\u2019m a nuisance around women.\u201d He isn\u2019t. He avoids romance. In fact, none of those descriptions would be right.</p> <p>For a start, Nighy is far from the manor born. He grew up in Caterham, Surrey, to Irish parents, in a house attached to his dad\u2019s garage, with petrol pumps outside the front door. (His dad, like him, was courteous and a snappy dresser: he styled himself like Bing Crosby and used a cigarette as an accessory.) In the 1970s, Nighy was friends with other working-class actors, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/julie-walters\" title=\"\">Julie Walters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/04/pete-postlethwaite-film-actor\" title=\"\">Pete Postlethwaite</a>, when they all worked at the Liverpool Everyman, and he can get quite angry about establishment attitudes.</p> <p>But the main thing people get wrong about Nighy is that they assume he\u2019s relaxed. How could such a cool cat be anything but chill? Actually, he is naturally fraught. You can see it in his posture: he sits forward in his seat; he moves swiftly through crowds, like a knife. He has a tendency to fret, to beat himself up about stuff. His standards, high in everything, are almost insurmountable when it comes to himself. He can\u2019t read his own interviews, for instance, because they send him into a fugue of misery. He can\u2019t watch his own films for the same reason. He doesn\u2019t see what his fans see, which is an intelligent, gifted actor being brilliant at his job.</p> <p>This is what he sees: \u201cYou look terrible,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, you look terrible according to you, unless you\u2019re a weirdo and you look at yourself and you think, \u2018Wow, I look pretty good.\u2019 But I\u2019m not one of those. So there\u2019s that to get over, and then you\u2019ve got to watch yourself act and see yourself not pulling off all those things you thought you might, this time, have pulled off. Instead, you did that default thing that you always do. You think, \u2018I did that again? Are you serious?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b9d9a61b37adfbd108db6727d58ae5b913860dad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9d9a61b37adfbd108db6727d58ae5b913860dad/0_663_7087_4254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I did that again?

Because all my fears about my inadequacies are confirmed when I watch myself. I know there\u2019s an answer, and the answer is, get over yourself. But that\u2019s hard. I suppose it\u2019s a form of dysmorphia. I mean, I <em>hope</em> it\u2019s a form of dysmorphia.\u201d</p> <p>All of this means that he\u2019s rarely seen one of his films or TV shows the whole way through (sometimes he sees bits, because he has to record extra dialogue after filming). Which is a shame, obviously, because he\u2019s been in some absolute crackers: <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/26/state-of-play-review\" title=\"\">State of Play</a></em>; <em>Still Crazy</em>; <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/02/drama.periodandhistorical\" title=\"\">Notes on a Scandal</a></em>; <em>Gideon\u2019s Daughter</em>; <em>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</em>; <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/16/sometimes-always-never-review-bill-nighy-frank-cottrell-boyce\" title=\"\">Sometimes</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/16/sometimes-always-never-review-bill-nighy-frank-cottrell-boyce\" title=\"\"> Always</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/16/sometimes-always-never-review-bill-nighy-frank-cottrell-boyce\" title=\"\"> Never</a></em>.</p> <p>And to this long CV of fabulously watchable stuff, we can add the movie we are here to talk about: <em>Emma</em>. Yes, yes, it\u2019s ye olde Jane Austen, but this is a new version, directed by LA rock photographer <a href=\"http://www.autumndewilde.com/\" title=\"\">Autumn de Wilde</a>, and it\u2019s great, even for those of us who are naturally allergic to Austen films. Nighy himself tends to avoid period drama: partly because of the costumes and partly because they tend to provoke a particular type of acting. \u201cEverybody starts standing in a certain way and talking in a certain way,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with Shakespeare, or Chekhov. Or Harold Pinter: everyone\u2019s got a weird voice. It\u2019s odd how that style is handed down. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even spoken about. And it\u2019s very hard to resist. I mean, I\u2019m not immune.\u201d</p> <p>But this new Emma, while it uses old-fashioned language, avoids such clich\u00e9s. The emotions are understandable. Booker prize winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/eleanor-catton\" title=\"\">Eleanor Catton</a> wrote the script, and the cast is not as you might predict, meaning it\u2019s not an English luvvie-fest. Nighy is great. It\u2019s hard to think of him being bad in anything, despite his self-criticism. His character, Emma\u2019s father, Mr Woodhouse, is constantly worried about draughts and the cold. There\u2019s an amazing moment at the start of a dinner party where someone mentions that there might be snow, and he immediately starts panicking and insists everyone leaves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7603ec442832fe7967c3abd2828ebb961b9da979\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7603ec442832fe7967c3abd2828ebb961b9da979/14_0_3301_1982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Almost everybody in my world are decent, smart, funny people,\u2019: in Pirates of the Caribbean.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Almost everybody in my world are decent, smart, funny people,\u2019: in Pirates of the Caribbean.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disney/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a valetudinarian,\u201d says Nighy. \u201cNot to be confused with a hypochondriac. Hypochondria is being selfishly concerned with your own health. Valetudinarians are obsessively concerned with other people\u2019s. And therefore he lives in terror of draughts and any kind of change in the weather. He\u2019s always thinking that everyone\u2019s going to die. Which is ridiculous until you start reading anything about 1815, and you realise he\u2019s got a point.\u201d</p> <p>Nighy chose to do <em>Emma</em> because he liked De Wilde. \u201cI\u2019d never met anyone like her, she is very unusual. This California person with a punk ethic.\u201d He went for a meeting with her and instead of opening a laptop and showing him her vision on a screen, De Wilde presented him with a wooden box, tied with a bow. Inside were around 60 paper frames, like Regency portraits, with pictures inside. One was of him: Nighy was her first choice for Woodhouse.</p> <p>De Wilde is one of several female directors whom Nighy has worked with. He is baffled as to why anyone might see it as a male occupation. \u201cI mean, what? Why on earth would one set of genitalia recommend you, rather than another?\u201d Anyway, he loved her. He enjoys other people\u2019s idiosyncrasies. He tells me about <em>Emma</em>\u2019s director of photography, Christopher Blauvelt, who comes from a skateboarding background, which Nighy thought \u201cdeeply impressive\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe has a punk band with his wife called Rat Shit!\u201d he says, delightedly. During filming, Nighy once caught Blauvelt lying on the ground, checking a shot. \u201cMaintain the bonnet,\u201d said Blauvelt, in his LA skater drawl. Nighy found this so delicious that he had a Fred Perry shirt especially altered for Blauvelt: he got Maintain The Bonnet embroidered over the pocket. Maroon, on blue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5670b1914d6c29452746d31f00dd4a5c4b56b0d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5670b1914d6c29452746d31f00dd4a5c4b56b0d4/859_1082_4241_2543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A modernist?

When this magazine asked him to wear something for photos other than his usual suit, he took it as a challenge, asking a stylist friend to help him out. We discuss what he wore, and Nighy goes into mad detail. He chose a couple of jumpers (\u201cfine wool, nothing vulgar or chunky\u201d), and actually took off his suit jacket. \u201cI wore a jacket called <a href=\"https://grenfell.com/collections/golfer-jacket\" title=\"\">the Golfer, made by Grenfell</a>, which is essentially a short Harrington, but in olive green, not blue. It has the plaid on the inside. And the groovy thing, the thing that makes it all OK, is that the zip goes both ways, up and down.\u201d Of course, pre-shoot, he had been nervous, but he bumped into two fans, ladies from America, while walking there, and they were complimentary. He \u201cheld on to this\u201d for confidence, while in front of the camera.</p> <p>Nighy is not designed for leisurewear, nor for leisure-life. When he was shooting <em>Pirates of the </em><em>Caribbean</em> (he played a giant squid with a Scottish accent) he stayed indoors in his room, with the curtains shut, while the film\u2019s other actors spent their days off cavorting in the warm sea. By the end of the shoot, he still didn\u2019t know which way the beach was. He\u2019s just done another film, <em>Minamata</em>, with his old <em>Pirates</em> chum Johnny Depp, who he describes as \u201cCompletely charming, gracious as ever, everyone gets treated impeccably.\u201d Nighy finds most actors easy to get on with. \u201cNinety-five per cent of everybody in my world are decent, smart, funny people,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody rubs along together because they\u2019ve got very used to getting to know people at some depth quite quickly and over a short period of time, and then going on to do it with another 100 people. And if anybody is sort of an obstacle of any kind, often they don\u2019t prosper.\u201d</p> <p>He works a lot, because he gets asked a lot. \u201cIt\u2019s a job,\u201d he says. \u201cI still get more than four weeks off a year, which is more than most people.\u201d When he\u2019s not working, Nighy likes to mooch around. He goes to bookshops, has a lunch, reads the newspaper at a caf\u00e9 table. He\u2019s just made a playlist for Maison Assouline, a caf\u00e9 he frequents in Piccadilly. Because he\u2019s in there so often, he asked the waitress if she was sick of hearing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeaS6fuUoA\" title=\"\">Lovely Day by Bill Withers </a>(\u201cIt\u2019s a great song, but it was on a lot\u201d). The waitress confessed that she was a bit bored, so Nighy spent weeks making a playlist. It has more than 100 songs on it. He shows me it on his phone, reading out the tracks with intense delight. Angie Stone, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/07/dr-john-obituary\" title=\"\">Dr John</a>, Prince, Mary J Blige\u2026 He has a separate playlist of Mary J, which he also shows me; and another that just features several versions of one song, Be Thankful For What You\u2019ve Got (original by William DeVaughn, he informs).

I love that Ancelotti is in England\u2026 Ancelotti at Everton, for me, it\u2019s just a wonderful thing. He\u2019s such an incredible man, unparalleled in his career as both a player and as a manager. I love Liverpool, too.

      "bodyText": "The first time I interviewed Bill Nighy was in 2004. Sixteen years ago! He has barely changed. He is a remarkably consistent person, in taste and personality, and because of this, he seems ageless. Perhaps a little slimmer and greyer than he used to be, but that\u2019s it. His hair is styled in the same way it has been for several decades \u2013 longer on the top, slicked back from his forehead \u2013 and no matter what year, what month, what day you catch him, he will be dressed in what he calls \u201ca decent lounge suit\u201d, in navy, with appropriate shirt and shoes. Heavy-rimmed specs nestle in his pocket or on his nose. As familiar as his outfit is his charm. Nighy is always charming, whether to fans, an interviewer, a waiter. We meet in a hotel bar around the corner from his apartment in Piccadilly and the first thing he does is inquire about me and my life. And he listens to the answer: a nice trait not evident in every successful actor. He bothers to entertain \u2013 his stories are delivered well, whether they\u2019re about famous people or someone he met out and about. He still works very hard \u2013 often making four or five films a year \u2013 and he takes pleasure in his job and is happy to talk about it. In fact, the only major change in Nighy in the years I\u2019ve known him is that he is no longer with his long-term partner, Diana Quick (they separated in 2008, after 28 years together). They remain on good terms and, he tells me, they had a jolly Christmas with lots of people around the table. His daughter, Mary, is married to a Frenchman. \u201cThere were charades,\u201d he says. \u201cWe sang the Marseillaise. It was great.\u201d So there you have it: same as he ever was. But Nighy is far from dull. On the contrary, he\u2019s unusual: a very particular person with very particular tastes and habits. What he likes are clothes, music, books, football, city life. He is a modernist \u2013 \u201cI do subscribe to that ethos\u201d \u2013 with the accompanying purist attitude. He can be wildly funny about his own horror when what he considers to be the correct etiquette is not upheld. Though he\u2019s played ageing rockers on a couple of occasions, this is very much not his aesthetic. Anyway, because of all this \u2013 Nighy\u2019s style and politesse, his charisma and wit \u2013 he\u2019s often misinterpreted. \u201cI get called lots of L words,\u201d he says. \u201cLouche, languid, laconic. A lounge lizard, like I\u2019m a nuisance around women.\u201d He isn\u2019t. He avoids romance. In fact, none of those descriptions would be right. For a start, Nighy is far from the manor born. He grew up in Caterham, Surrey, to Irish parents, in a house attached to his dad\u2019s garage, with petrol pumps outside the front door. (His dad, like him, was courteous and a snappy dresser: he styled himself like Bing Crosby and used a cigarette as an accessory.) In the 1970s, Nighy was friends with other working-class actors, like Julie Walters and Pete Postlethwaite, when they all worked at the Liverpool Everyman, and he can get quite angry about establishment attitudes. But the main thing people get wrong about Nighy is that they assume he\u2019s relaxed. How could such a cool cat be anything but chill? Actually, he is naturally fraught. You can see it in his posture: he sits forward in his seat; he moves swiftly through crowds, like a knife. He has a tendency to fret, to beat himself up about stuff. His standards, high in everything, are almost insurmountable when it comes to himself. He can\u2019t read his own interviews, for instance, because they send him into a fugue of misery. He can\u2019t watch his own films for the same reason. He doesn\u2019t see what his fans see, which is an intelligent, gifted actor being brilliant at his job. This is what he sees: \u201cYou look terrible,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, you look terrible according to you, unless you\u2019re a weirdo and you look at yourself and you think, \u2018Wow, I look pretty good.\u2019 But I\u2019m not one of those. So there\u2019s that to get over, and then you\u2019ve got to watch yourself act and see yourself not pulling off all those things you thought you might, this time, have pulled off. Instead, you did that default thing that you always do. You think, \u2018I did that again? Are you serious?\u2019\u201d These might seem trivialities, but they knock him sideways. \u201cThe trouble is that confidence is a movable feast and I\u2019m not famous for it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd, therefore, it takes me quite a long time to recover if I see myself on screen. Because all my fears about my inadequacies are confirmed when I watch myself. I know there\u2019s an answer, and the answer is, get over yourself. But that\u2019s hard. I suppose it\u2019s a form of dysmorphia. I mean, I hope it\u2019s a form of dysmorphia.\u201d All of this means that he\u2019s rarely seen one of his films or TV shows the whole way through (sometimes he sees bits, because he has to record extra dialogue after filming). Which is a shame, obviously, because he\u2019s been in some absolute crackers: State of Play; Still Crazy; Notes on a Scandal; Gideon\u2019s Daughter; The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel; Sometimes Always Never. And to this long CV of fabulously watchable stuff, we can add the movie we are here to talk about: Emma. Yes, yes, it\u2019s ye olde Jane Austen, but this is a new version, directed by LA rock photographer Autumn de Wilde, and it\u2019s great, even for those of us who are naturally allergic to Austen films. Nighy himself tends to avoid period drama: partly because of the costumes and partly because they tend to provoke a particular type of acting. \u201cEverybody starts standing in a certain way and talking in a certain way,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with Shakespeare, or Chekhov. Or Harold Pinter: everyone\u2019s got a weird voice. It\u2019s odd how that style is handed down. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even spoken about. And it\u2019s very hard to resist. I mean, I\u2019m not immune.\u201d But this new Emma, while it uses old-fashioned language, avoids such clich\u00e9s. The emotions are understandable. Booker prize winner Eleanor Catton wrote the script, and the cast is not as you might predict, meaning it\u2019s not an English luvvie-fest. Nighy is great. It\u2019s hard to think of him being bad in anything, despite his self-criticism. His character, Emma\u2019s father, Mr Woodhouse, is constantly worried about draughts and the cold. There\u2019s an amazing moment at the start of a dinner party where someone mentions that there might be snow, and he immediately starts panicking and insists everyone leaves. \u201cHe\u2019s a valetudinarian,\u201d says Nighy. \u201cNot to be confused with a hypochondriac. Hypochondria is being selfishly concerned with your own health. Valetudinarians are obsessively concerned with other people\u2019s. And therefore he lives in terror of draughts and any kind of change in the weather. He\u2019s always thinking that everyone\u2019s going to die. Which is ridiculous until you start reading anything about 1815, and you realise he\u2019s got a point.\u201d Nighy chose to do Emma because he liked De Wilde. \u201cI\u2019d never met anyone like her, she is very unusual. This California person with a punk ethic.\u201d He went for a meeting with her and instead of opening a laptop and showing him her vision on a screen, De Wilde presented him with a wooden box, tied with a bow. Inside were around 60 paper frames, like Regency portraits, with pictures inside. One was of him: Nighy was her first choice for Woodhouse. De Wilde is one of several female directors whom Nighy has worked with. He is baffled as to why anyone might see it as a male occupation. \u201cI mean, what? Why on earth would one set of genitalia recommend you, rather than another?\u201d Anyway, he loved her. He enjoys other people\u2019s idiosyncrasies. He tells me about Emma\u2019s director of photography, Christopher Blauvelt, who comes from a skateboarding background, which Nighy thought \u201cdeeply impressive\u201d. \u201cHe has a punk band with his wife called Rat Shit!\u201d he says, delightedly. During filming, Nighy once caught Blauvelt lying on the ground, checking a shot. \u201cMaintain the bonnet,\u201d said Blauvelt, in his LA skater drawl. Nighy found this so delicious that he had a Fred Perry shirt especially altered for Blauvelt: he got Maintain The Bonnet embroidered over the pocket. Maroon, on blue. Nighy is obsessed with clothes. When this magazine asked him to wear something for photos other than his usual suit, he took it as a challenge, asking a stylist friend to help him out. We discuss what he wore, and Nighy goes into mad detail. He chose a couple of jumpers (\u201cfine wool, nothing vulgar or chunky\u201d), and actually took off his suit jacket. \u201cI wore a jacket called the Golfer, made by Grenfell, which is essentially a short Harrington, but in olive green, not blue. It has the plaid on the inside. And the groovy thing, the thing that makes it all OK, is that the zip goes both ways, up and down.\u201d Of course, pre-shoot, he had been nervous, but he bumped into two fans, ladies from America, while walking there, and they were complimentary. He \u201cheld on to this\u201d for confidence, while in front of the camera. Nighy is not designed for leisurewear, nor for leisure-life. When he was shooting Pirates of the Caribbean (he played a giant squid with a Scottish accent) he stayed indoors in his room, with the curtains shut, while the film\u2019s other actors spent their days off cavorting in the warm sea. By the end of the shoot, he still didn\u2019t know which way the beach was. He\u2019s just done another film, Minamata, with his old Pirates chum Johnny Depp, who he describes as \u201cCompletely charming, gracious as ever, everyone gets treated impeccably.\u201d Nighy finds most actors easy to get on with. \u201cNinety-five per cent of everybody in my world are decent, smart, funny people,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody rubs along together because they\u2019ve got very used to getting to know people at some depth quite quickly and over a short period of time, and then going on to do it with another 100 people. And if anybody is sort of an obstacle of any kind, often they don\u2019t prosper.\u201d He works a lot, because he gets asked a lot. \u201cIt\u2019s a job,\u201d he says. \u201cI still get more than four weeks off a year, which is more than most people.\u201d When he\u2019s not working, Nighy likes to mooch around. He goes to bookshops, has a lunch, reads the newspaper at a caf\u00e9 table. He\u2019s just made a playlist for Maison Assouline, a caf\u00e9 he frequents in Piccadilly. Because he\u2019s in there so often, he asked the waitress if she was sick of hearing Lovely Day by Bill Withers (\u201cIt\u2019s a great song, but it was on a lot\u201d). The waitress confessed that she was a bit bored, so Nighy spent weeks making a playlist. It has more than 100 songs on it. He shows me it on his phone, reading out the tracks with intense delight. Angie Stone, Dr John, Prince, Mary J Blige\u2026 He has a separate playlist of Mary J, which he also shows me; and another that just features several versions of one song, Be Thankful For What You\u2019ve Got (original by William DeVaughn, he informs). The man is a proper music spotter. He made the playlist partly because he enjoys it, but also because he loves caf\u00e9s. \u201cI\u2019ve spent quite a lot of time in New York, because of doing plays,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd for a while I couldn\u2019t work out what was slightly unsatisfactory about it. And it\u2019s because they don\u2019t really have caf\u00e9s. They have bars and they have diners, all of which are great. But they\u2019re not caf\u00e9s. There were a few, but they don\u2019t have many where you sit out on the pavement.\u201d It\u2019s what he loves. He walks everywhere, because he hates feeling encumbered and he associates having a car with that feeling, an extra thing to think about, some more keys to carry. \u201cI can always get a cab if needed, and I\u2019ve got my Oyster card, you know.\u201d The countryside doesn\u2019t appeal: \u201cI pop in now and again and have a look.\u201d The sea is OK, for a short while. \u201cFor an outing.

He doesn\u2019t mind being recognised, or having his photo taken with fans. \u201cPeople are perfectly gracious. And it all happens very quickly and it\u2019s nice.\u201d Before he goes, I feel we should discuss Nighy\u2019s other love: football. Characteristically, he has an individual approach to fandom. He\u2019s a Crystal Palace supporter \u2013 they\u2019re the team whose results he checks first \u2013 but he flatly refuses to get involved in the macho, tribal aspect of football. \u201cOnly because I\u2019m greedy,\u201d he says. \u201cLast year, mostly I was watching Italian football.

      "body": "<p>Having found unexpected laughter in the historical horrors of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/22/the-death-of-stalin-review-more-bleak-than-black-armando-iannucci\" title=\"\">The Death of Stalin</a></em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/30/armando-iannucci-david-copperfield-loop-death-of-stalin\" title=\"\">Armando Iannucci</a> works comedic wonders with the labyrinthine twists and turns of Dickens\u2019s endlessly reinterpretable Victorian narrative. Astutely amplifying the absurdist \u2013 and remarkably modernist \u2013 elements of his source, Iannucci and co-writer Simon Blackwell conjure a surreal cinematic odyssey that is as accessible as it is intelligent and unexpected. At its heart lies a theatrical journey of self-discovery, in which our narrator (superbly played by the endlessly versatile Dev Patel) sets out to determine whether he is \u201cthe hero of my own story\u201d, struggling to make a name for himself (literally) as he strides through a vividly realised landscape of memory and invention.</p> <p>We open with Copperfield on stage, commencing the recitation of his story before striding through a painted backdrop straight into the glowing landscape of East Anglia. It\u2019s a device that will be revisited as scenes fall away like tarpaulin backdrops and memories are projected on to walls, interspersed by handwritten chapter-headings. As with Michael Winterbottom\u2019s <em>Tristram Shandy</em> adaptation <em>A Cock &amp; Bull Story</em>, Iannucci plays inventively with the creative process, displaying a keen eye for visual storytelling as the adult Copperfield witnesses his own birth, comes face to face with his boyish younger selves (terrifically played by Ranveer Jaiswal and Jairaj Varsani ), and learns to weave characters in and out of his life as he pens a \u201cwritten memory wherein loss and love live for ever side by side\u201d.</p> <p>Joining him on his journey are an astonishing array of players, cast with a colour-blind inclusivity that allows Iannucci to broaden the scope and reach of his film beyond that of many previous Dickens adaptations.

      "bodyText": "Having found unexpected laughter in the historical horrors of The Death of Stalin, Armando Iannucci works comedic wonders with the labyrinthine twists and turns of Dickens\u2019s endlessly reinterpretable Victorian narrative. Astutely amplifying the absurdist \u2013 and remarkably modernist \u2013 elements of his source, Iannucci and co-writer Simon Blackwell conjure a surreal cinematic odyssey that is as accessible as it is intelligent and unexpected. At its heart lies a theatrical journey of self-discovery, in which our narrator (superbly played by the endlessly versatile Dev Patel) sets out to determine whether he is \u201cthe hero of my own story\u201d, struggling to make a name for himself (literally) as he strides through a vividly realised landscape of memory and invention. We open with Copperfield on stage, commencing the recitation of his story before striding through a painted backdrop straight into the glowing landscape of East Anglia. It\u2019s a device that will be revisited as scenes fall away like tarpaulin backdrops and memories are projected on to walls, interspersed by handwritten chapter-headings. As with Michael Winterbottom\u2019s Tristram Shandy adaptation A Cock &amp; Bull Story, Iannucci plays inventively with the creative process, displaying a keen eye for visual storytelling as the adult Copperfield witnesses his own birth, comes face to face with his boyish younger selves (terrifically played by Ranveer Jaiswal and Jairaj Varsani ), and learns to weave characters in and out of his life as he pens a \u201cwritten memory wherein loss and love live for ever side by side\u201d. Joining him on his journey are an astonishing array of players, cast with a colour-blind inclusivity that allows Iannucci to broaden the scope and reach of his film beyond that of many previous Dickens adaptations. From Benedict Wong as the wine-chasing Mr Wickfield, to Rosalind Eleazar as his daughter Agnes, who holds the true key to Copperfield\u2019s affections, Sarah Crowe (nominated for Bafta\u2019s new casting award) surrounds Patel with a diverse array of performers. As Betsey Trotwood, a magnificent Tilda Swinton is introduced with her nose squished against a window, while Darren Boyd\u2019s ghastly Murdstone is a sinister symphony of hair, eyebrows and teeth. Peter Capaldi plays Mr Micawber as a benevolent Fagin with terrible squeezebox skills (\u201cAngels in his fingertips!\u201d says Bronagh Gallagher\u2019s cheery Mrs Micawber) while Nikki Amuka-Bird lends real steel to the stern figure of Mrs Steerforth. Best of all is Ben Whishaw\u2019s Uriah Heep, a pudding-bowled apparition who creeps through corridors like a cross between Norman Wisdom and Riff-Raff from Rocky Horror \u2013 a volatile mix of subservience and defiance; a beaten dog ready to bite. As for Patel, he displays more than a touch of the divine pathos of Charlie Chaplin, whether wooing the hopelessly inappropriate Dora Spenlow (Morfydd Clark, who brilliantly doubles as David\u2019s mother Clara) or carousing in a drunken speeded-up revelry with the posh students whose \u201cgentlemanly\u201d company he craves.

      "body": "<p>When my phone used to light up with my younger brother\u2019s name, I always knew I could safely ignore it if I wanted to \u2013 whether it be a self-indulgent video of his latest attempt at Z-list fame or a harsh tweet about a celebrity I\u2019d never heard of. Whatever. I even coined a sarcastic hashtag when replying to him: #nobodycaresmartyn.</p> <p>But then one nondescript morning in May 2017, my phone lit up with his name on all the notifications \u2013 hundreds of them \u2013 and there was no way I could ignore any of them.</p> <p>My brother was one of the 22 people killed in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/manchester-arena-explosion\" title=\"\">Manchester Arena terror attack</a>. He was 29. Losing him in this way meant I instantly went from an almost complete inexperience of grief to having to endure the most unexpectedly public form of loss imaginable. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is losing him made easier by the rectangle of glass in my pocket?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In an ideal world \u2013 relatively speaking \u2013 you get your affairs in order when you are facing your own mortality, at least when you have the time to think about it. A person knowingly approaching their end writes a will, ties up loose ends and makes their peace. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d do \u2013 and I strongly suspect Martyn didn\u2019t know either (although, curiously, his dramatic funeral was arranged in perfect accordance with his wishes, as discussed jokingly over many drinks with friends. Be careful what you morbidly joke about, because when your number is up those hazy musings quickly become event directions). The point is that part of making your mortal exit is drawing a line under your existence and leaving your legacy behind. Planting your flag and communicating to future observers: \u201cI was here. I existed.\u201d</p> <p>But sometimes the universe doesn\u2019t extend you the courtesy of allowing you to shuffle your paperwork and settle your affairs in your own time. Despite this, even though he checked out quite ahead of schedule, in a strange way Martyn had already done some of the work himself, without realising it. Like the rest of my generation, my brother\u2019s existence was eternally self-documented in detail across social media. It is an archive of self that he accidentally left behind and an example of what makes losing someone in the modern world an experience that\u2019s unique to our time.</p> <p>It\u2019s been bittersweet so far. Although the manner in which he died meant that there wasn\u2019t any time to prepare, he left behind an unfathomably rich web of content \u2013 endless tendrils of his digital self, captured in imagery, video, music, writing and a truly breathtaking number of tweets. Although he was impressively prolific, it wasn\u2019t ever completely raw \u2013 he carefully curated his online presence as it unfolded (photos taken from his good side strongly preferred, please, and don\u2019t post them online without his sign-off, thank you). The abrupt end to this constant barrage of self-directed content means his online legacy has a stark truth about it that\u2019s more powerful than anything he could have intentionally put together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f13bbffd18f0636c7bd55eb8fbb8081c5db73cea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f13bbffd18f0636c7bd55eb8fbb8081c5db73cea/0_140_918_551/500.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of Martyn in a cap, sipping custard\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018His final tweets are still replied to by hundreds of other users, years after his death.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martyn Hett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The digital mixed-media self-portrait he created in these spaces is, in many ways, the real him, rather than whatever planned content I\u2019m sure he\u2019d have put together had he had the luxury of a little time to work on his media strategy (and believe me, he would have).</p> <p>That technology underpinned the entire experience wasn\u2019t just in his use of it \u2013 it was in our use of it, too. Family, community, press, police, rubberneckers. It was my smartphone that lit up when the attack happened; social media where we put the word out about him being missing and circulated his photograph, and online platforms that ultimately let people know when we\u2019d found out what happened to him.</p> <p>It was, of course, also social media that worked as an easy vector for fairly hostile press intrusion, something that began literally after the attack and in many ways continues to this day. More importantly, though, social media still plays a critical role in the story: it allows me, my family, his friends and anyone else to explore the digital legacy that he\u2019s built. His social feeds still exist, but the channels are paused \u2013 he was writing and broadcasting until the very last moment; his final transmission being a tweet complaining about the toilet queues in the arena. His broadcast stopped there.</p> <p>He did what many of us do most days \u2013 built a digital footprint, filled with imagery and notes and videos and a million other captured moments, fragments, pieces of the trail that make up you as a person (or at least, the version of your online self you\u2019ve chosen to present to the world, be that accurate or not). These fragments of digital ephemera have now become intangible virtual memorials. Some are improvised, like his final tweets that are still replied to by hundreds of other users, years after his death. Others are more planned \u2013 Martyn\u2019s personal Facebook page was quickly and officially \u201cmemorialised\u201d in a surprisingly sensitive way by Facebook, but (as I\u2019m sure he\u2019d howl laughing at) this contrasts wildly with the wholly inappropriate header image and scathing posts underneath. He was here and then he wasn\u2019t, but everything he\u2019s created remains exactly how he left it, as it will when you or I check out \u2013 expected or not.</p> <p><em><strong>My brother and</strong></em> I sit squarely in that curious generational overlap where we existed as children without digital technology or the internet, but suddenly had it bestowed upon us as teenagers. This abrupt connection totally re-wired how we existed as young people and, subsequently, as adults. Put another way, I\u2019m old enough to remember nervously calling the house phone of a girlfriend and praying her father didn\u2019t pick up, but at the same time I\u2019m young enough that my angsty teenage diary entries were posted to early online journalling sites, and not scrawled into the traditional hidden notebook. This contrast, this rapid-onset unveiling of our digital selves, has been a huge factor in how and why my generation has taken to social media, and why my brother and I both went full tilt with it from the minute it was something we could use to broadcast with.</p> <p>Now, in 2020, this progress has had a human impact in ways I didn\u2019t expect. In my pocket is a tiny miracle of engineering that allows me to access the sum of human knowledge, reach out to almost anyone on the planet, and indeed call up a perfect video recording of my departed brother.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d3185e60db63c3680d25ba717c771f08be12dd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d3185e60db63c3680d25ba717c771f08be12dd8/0_132_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Martin in sunglasses standing in front of a wall of graffiti\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Martyn carefully curated his online presence.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martyn Hett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The really big companies that shepherd our online existences are incredibly good at what they do, but Martyn\u2019s death has shown me that many digital entities handle tricky things like death and difficult human \u201cstuff\u201d really badly.</p> <p>I build things with technology for a living, and in my job we sometimes call these things \u201csquishy\u201d problems \u2013 awkward human problems that can\u2019t be solved easily with data points and algorithms, and need a human hand (and human empathy) to correct. This is a phenomenon that will affect us more and more as AI and machine-learning technologies take over more of our computational heavy lifting. But it still feels like we\u2019re a long way off knowing how to deal with it.</p> <p>I found this out in the blackest of ways while standing at the site of the bomb blast in the arena a few weeks later, speechless at the damage. He\u2019d laugh, I\u2019m sure, at the notion of Facebook helpfully asking me to \u201ccheck in\u201d to let my friends know how much fun I was having\u2026</p> <p>More broadly, the digital behemoths of social media are beginning to reach a tipping point where the demand for usernames is outstripping supply. Twitter recently announced (and then hastily retracted) a proposed cull of what they deem to be inactive accounts. It\u2019s quite a loaded word though \u2013 inactive \u2013 isn\u2019t it? The accounts of the lost are certainly inactive in a literal sense, but they still have a reason to be there: they have meaning to people, and that\u2019s what makes them active for so many.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af37ce4a57eb3ade4f6044552e33103e2cfd61f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af37ce4a57eb3ade4f6044552e33103e2cfd61f6/0_133_1772_1063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martyn and Dan Hett, as children on a picnic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The accounts of the lost are inactive in a literal sense but they still have meaning to people\u2019: Martyn and Dan Hett, as children.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family Picture</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The data can be downloaded and saved, but the notion that one of these inadvertent crystallisations of my brother\u2019s digital self could arbitrarily disappear is a challenging one, not least because there could feasibly be a day where the account is gone and someone else takes the name.</p> <p>When streams of online activity abruptly cease broadcasting, they don\u2019t disappear, they become vital archives that are, for now, permanent. We\u2019re only a decade or two away from reaching that macabre milestone on long-standing platforms such as Facebook where accounts belonging to dead users outnumber the accounts of the living.</p> <p>Martyn\u2019s digital legacy continues to inspire and be built upon, even within my own work. Understandably, my creative output effectively ceased when Martyn died. Over time, as we rebuilt, I found my work changing direction, too. For the past few years I\u2019ve been engaged in creating introspective experimental video games and digital artworks that explore grief, loss and, increasingly, the nature of going through this process in a world powered by technology that is in a constant state of flux. I\u2019m now creating bigger and more ambitious work that examines radicalisation and extremism, and our fragmented existences within digital spaces. I\u2019m using technology to not just look at the loss I experienced, but ask how we got here and why any of this happened. Not all of this work is about Martyn, but all of it is because of him \u2013 and quietly for him.</p> <p><em><strong>Living each moment</strong></em> as if it\u2019s your last is a well-worn clich\u00e9, but in 2020 it might be more accurate to settle for updating your status as if it\u2019s your last. Inevitably, without knowing, you\u2019ll have inadvertently written the closing sentence of the terribly self-indulgent story you\u2019ve spent your whole life creating. Was it the grand sign-off you wanted, or a throwaway tweet about the train being late? I wonder which of those would be more truthful, and whether or not this is important to those looking back at it from the future?</p> <p>I wonder, too, whether those facing their mortality with a little more notice than my brother had may end up with more than the trail of annoying nonsense he left behind by accident. The nonsense is his truth, in a way. I often question whether losing someone is made more difficult, or easier, by the fact I have a rectangle of glass in my pocket that can find the sound of his voice, in seconds, at any time. I can sit with my two young children, watching Uncle Martyn\u2019s idiot grin and hearing his ceaselessly irritating cackling, and when I see them smile back at it, I have my answer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bf0476df3f478c8330225d04bb0141cae227c2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bf0476df3f478c8330225d04bb0141cae227c2d/0_263_4780_2867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martyn Hett's partner Russell Hayward in dark glasses, with his hand over his mouth, and being supported either side, at his funeral.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mourners gather: partner Russell Hayward (centre) at Martyn\u2019s funeral.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Thompson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a society it feels as if we\u2019re still adjusting to the effects of this constant digital capture, not least when it comes to thorny human problems, like losing someone. We\u2019re rapidly traversing technological and ethical ground that nobody has covered before. For better or worse, we are currently part of the first generation in history to inhabit a world where the living, and increasingly the dead, are documented with such accuracy.</p> <p>This shift has taken place incredibly quickly, and it\u2019s easy to forget that, within living memory, the sum total of most people\u2019s visual existence was contained in a handful of printed photographs. The rest was passed down as stories, retellings, memories. Over time the clarity faded, the person moved in and out of focus, became invisible. Our enormous advancements in technology (and our willingness to embrace them) mean that, for the first time, that image never blurs or fades, but lives on. The meaning of this is subtle, yet profound: the way we look at death itself has changed for ever. There are ghosts in our machines, and I\u2019m glad we have them.</p>",

But then one nondescript morning in May 2017, my phone lit up with his name on all the notifications \u2013 hundreds of them \u2013 and there was no way I could ignore any of them. My brother was one of the 22 people killed in the Manchester Arena terror attack. He was 29. Losing him in this way meant I instantly went from an almost complete inexperience of grief to having to endure the most unexpectedly public form of loss imaginable. In an ideal world \u2013 relatively speaking \u2013 you get your affairs in order when you are facing your own mortality, at least when you have the time to think about it. A person knowingly approaching their end writes a will, ties up loose ends and makes their peace. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d do \u2013 and I strongly suspect Martyn didn\u2019t know either (although, curiously, his dramatic funeral was arranged in perfect accordance with his wishes, as discussed jokingly over many drinks with friends. Be careful what you morbidly joke about, because when your number is up those hazy musings quickly become event directions). The point is that part of making your mortal exit is drawing a line under your existence and leaving your legacy behind. Planting your flag and communicating to future observers: \u201cI was here. I existed.\u201d But sometimes the universe doesn\u2019t extend you the courtesy of allowing you to shuffle your paperwork and settle your affairs in your own time. Despite this, even though he checked out quite ahead of schedule, in a strange way Martyn had already done some of the work himself, without realising it. Like the rest of my generation, my brother\u2019s existence was eternally self-documented in detail across social media. It is an archive of self that he accidentally left behind and an example of what makes losing someone in the modern world an experience that\u2019s unique to our time. It\u2019s been bittersweet so far. Although the manner in which he died meant that there wasn\u2019t any time to prepare, he left behind an unfathomably rich web of content \u2013 endless tendrils of his digital self, captured in imagery, video, music, writing and a truly breathtaking number of tweets. Although he was impressively prolific, it wasn\u2019t ever completely raw \u2013 he carefully curated his online presence as it unfolded (photos taken from his good side strongly preferred, please, and don\u2019t post them online without his sign-off, thank you). The abrupt end to this constant barrage of self-directed content means his online legacy has a stark truth about it that\u2019s more powerful than anything he could have intentionally put together. The digital mixed-media self-portrait he created in these spaces is, in many ways, the real him, rather than whatever planned content I\u2019m sure he\u2019d have put together had he had the luxury of a little time to work on his media strategy (and believe me, he would have). That technology underpinned the entire experience wasn\u2019t just in his use of it \u2013 it was in our use of it, too. Family, community, press, police, rubberneckers. It was my smartphone that lit up when the attack happened; social media where we put the word out about him being missing and circulated his photograph, and online platforms that ultimately let people know when we\u2019d found out what happened to him. It was, of course, also social media that worked as an easy vector for fairly hostile press intrusion, something that began literally after the attack and in many ways continues to this day. More importantly, though, social media still plays a critical role in the story: it allows me, my family, his friends and anyone else to explore the digital legacy that he\u2019s built. His social feeds still exist, but the channels are paused \u2013 he was writing and broadcasting until the very last moment; his final transmission being a tweet complaining about the toilet queues in the arena. His broadcast stopped there. He did what many of us do most days \u2013 built a digital footprint, filled with imagery and notes and videos and a million other captured moments, fragments, pieces of the trail that make up you as a person (or at least, the version of your online self you\u2019ve chosen to present to the world, be that accurate or not). These fragments of digital ephemera have now become intangible virtual memorials. Some are improvised, like his final tweets that are still replied to by hundreds of other users, years after his death. Others are more planned \u2013 Martyn\u2019s personal Facebook page was quickly and officially \u201cmemorialised\u201d in a surprisingly sensitive way by Facebook, but (as I\u2019m sure he\u2019d howl laughing at) this contrasts wildly with the wholly inappropriate header image and scathing posts underneath. He was here and then he wasn\u2019t, but everything he\u2019s created remains exactly how he left it, as it will when you or I check out \u2013 expected or not. My brother and I sit squarely in that curious generational overlap where we existed as children without digital technology or the internet, but suddenly had it bestowed upon us as teenagers. This abrupt connection totally re-wired how we existed as young people and, subsequently, as adults. Put another way, I\u2019m old enough to remember nervously calling the house phone of a girlfriend and praying her father didn\u2019t pick up, but at the same time I\u2019m young enough that my angsty teenage diary entries were posted to early online journalling sites, and not scrawled into the traditional hidden notebook. This contrast, this rapid-onset unveiling of our digital selves, has been a huge factor in how and why my generation has taken to social media, and why my brother and I both went full tilt with it from the minute it was something we could use to broadcast with. Now, in 2020, this progress has had a human impact in ways I didn\u2019t expect. In my pocket is a tiny miracle of engineering that allows me to access the sum of human knowledge, reach out to almost anyone on the planet, and indeed call up a perfect video recording of my departed brother. The really big companies that shepherd our online existences are incredibly good at what they do, but Martyn\u2019s death has shown me that many digital entities handle tricky things like death and difficult human \u201cstuff\u201d really badly. I build things with technology for a living, and in my job we sometimes call these things \u201csquishy\u201d problems \u2013 awkward human problems that can\u2019t be solved easily with data points and algorithms, and need a human hand (and human empathy) to correct. This is a phenomenon that will affect us more and more as AI and machine-learning technologies take over more of our computational heavy lifting. But it still feels like we\u2019re a long way off knowing how to deal with it. I found this out in the blackest of ways while standing at the site of the bomb blast in the arena a few weeks later, speechless at the damage. He\u2019d laugh, I\u2019m sure, at the notion of Facebook helpfully asking me to \u201ccheck in\u201d to let my friends know how much fun I was having\u2026 More broadly, the digital behemoths of social media are beginning to reach a tipping point where the demand for usernames is outstripping supply. Twitter recently announced (and then hastily retracted) a proposed cull of what they deem to be inactive accounts. It\u2019s quite a loaded word though \u2013 inactive \u2013 isn\u2019t it? The accounts of the lost are certainly inactive in a literal sense, but they still have a reason to be there: they have meaning to people, and that\u2019s what makes them active for so many. The data can be downloaded and saved, but the notion that one of these inadvertent crystallisations of my brother\u2019s digital self could arbitrarily disappear is a challenging one, not least because there could feasibly be a day where the account is gone and someone else takes the name. When streams of online activity abruptly cease broadcasting, they don\u2019t disappear, they become vital archives that are, for now, permanent. We\u2019re only a decade or two away from reaching that macabre milestone on long-standing platforms such as Facebook where accounts belonging to dead users outnumber the accounts of the living. Martyn\u2019s digital legacy continues to inspire and be built upon, even within my own work. Understandably, my creative output effectively ceased when Martyn died. Over time, as we rebuilt, I found my work changing direction, too. For the past few years I\u2019ve been engaged in creating introspective experimental video games and digital artworks that explore grief, loss and, increasingly, the nature of going through this process in a world powered by technology that is in a constant state of flux. I\u2019m now creating bigger and more ambitious work that examines radicalisation and extremism, and our fragmented existences within digital spaces. I\u2019m using technology to not just look at the loss I experienced, but ask how we got here and why any of this happened. Not all of this work is about Martyn, but all of it is because of him \u2013 and quietly for him. Living each moment as if it\u2019s your last is a well-worn clich\u00e9, but in 2020 it might be more accurate to settle for updating your status as if it\u2019s your last. Inevitably, without knowing, you\u2019ll have inadvertently written the closing sentence of the terribly self-indulgent story you\u2019ve spent your whole life creating. Was it the grand sign-off you wanted, or a throwaway tweet about the train being late? I wonder which of those would be more truthful, and whether or not this is important to those looking back at it from the future? I wonder, too, whether those facing their mortality with a little more notice than my brother had may end up with more than the trail of annoying nonsense he left behind by accident. The nonsense is his truth, in a way. I often question whether losing someone is made more difficult, or easier, by the fact I have a rectangle of glass in my pocket that can find the sound of his voice, in seconds, at any time. I can sit with my two young children, watching Uncle Martyn\u2019s idiot grin and hearing his ceaselessly irritating cackling, and when I see them smile back at it, I have my answer. As a society it feels as if we\u2019re still adjusting to the effects of this constant digital capture, not least when it comes to thorny human problems, like losing someone. We\u2019re rapidly traversing technological and ethical ground that nobody has covered before. For better or worse, we are currently part of the first generation in history to inhabit a world where the living, and increasingly the dead, are documented with such accuracy. This shift has taken place incredibly quickly, and it\u2019s easy to forget that, within living memory, the sum total of most people\u2019s visual existence was contained in a handful of printed photographs. The rest was passed down as stories, retellings, memories. Over time the clarity faded, the person moved in and out of focus, became invisible. Our enormous advancements in technology (and our willingness to embrace them) mean that, for the first time, that image never blurs or fades, but lives on. The meaning of this is subtle, yet profound: the way we look at death itself has changed for ever. There are ghosts in our machines, and I\u2019m glad we have them.",

To mark its birthday, the company\u2019s current artistic director, Tamara Rojo, revived this once ubiquitous work as the conclusion of an even-handed, intelligent and engrossing programme. Giving a fair chance for the corps de ballet to shine, the event used film and performances to provide a good glimpse of the company\u2019s history while also showcasing its illustrious present and its impressive form. Highlights included Sergio Bernal\u2019s thrilling performance of a farruca from Antonio Ruiz Soler\u2019s The Three-Cornered Hat; a glimpse of Ben Stevenson\u2019s Three Preludes (performed at the matinee I saw by Jia Zhang and Skyler Martin) that made you long to see how the whole ballet stands up; and William Forsythe\u2019s electrifying Playlist (Track 2), which sets classical virtuosity to hip-hop music with explosive results.

      "body": "<p>The most alarming feature of our times is the disintegration of a shared belief in the values and principles of the European Enlightenment. They were never shouted from the hilltops, but were key to what we used to hold in common, and their collapse was a chief cause of Brexit. Unless they are quickly rediscovered and seen as a point around which to reunite, the BBC will now fall as well.</p> <p>Enlightenment values come in an interconnected bundle. First and foremost is the idea that there are objective truths and an accompanying public realm, held for all citizens, in which these truths can be tried and tested by argument, evidence and reason. It follows that there must be freedom to think and freely express oneself \u2013 otherwise no argument is possible. Science and fact will thus trump partisan ideology and superstition.</p> <p>This creates a public interest, expressed by government, that is held to account by equal citizens who can turn to law and independent judges to protect them. Thus the EU\u2019s treaties, and thus the BBC\u2019s public service obligation to educate, impartially inform and entertain every citizen. It is a cornerstone of the public realm.</p> <p>Rightwing populism <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/24/bbc-post-truth-dystopia-facts\" title=\"\">confounds these principles</a>. Conceptually, it holds, the public realm is a fraud: there is only an aggregation of individuals whose fate is to pursue their own interest. There can be no resolution or common ground achieved by argument; my truth is the only truth. Impartiality and public service are myths. Science can only be tolerated if it delivers conclusions with which I agree. Law and judges who get in the way of the popular will should be brushed aside. Only my views should be freely expressed. Christian faith is inherently superior to any other, which can be mocked and derided.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/22/victoria-derbyshires-bafta-winning-show-to-be-axed-in-bbc-cuts\">Victoria Derbyshire's Bafta-winning show to be axed in BBC cuts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The EU with its <em><a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/fact-figures/what-are-the-acquis-communautaire/\" title=\"\">acquis communautaire</a></em> celebrating the rule of law is anathema. So, too, is the BBC \u2013 an Enlightenment stronghold daring to pretend it can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/25/a-giant-what-other-countries-make-of-the-bbc-and-how-their-media-compare\" title=\"\">embody public service broadcasting</a> and an imagined impartiality which disguises that it is the natural enemy of rightwing Toryism with its anti-Enlightenment roots. It is the populist libertarian values of Fox News or Britain\u2019s rightwing press \u2013 intolerant of difference \u2013 that are inherently those the right should champion.</p> <p>Populists of the left hold mirror-image beliefs. There is not a public realm; \u201cpublicness\u201d can only be expressed in a socialist collective in which notions of public and private are dissolved. The public interest can only be the socialist interest. Socialist law is founded on socialist jurisprudence. Elections are essentially only useful to validate one socialist choice. Thus Momentum\u2019s leader, Jon Lansman, can organise a ballot to test his members\u2019 views in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/23/labour-leadership-momentum-survive\" title=\"\">only one candidate</a> can be voted for \u2013 Rebecca Long-Bailey. Thus Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s hostility to an EU whose Enlightenment treaties might obstruct the creation of a socialist collective, and his instinctive distrust of a BBC whose commitment to truth-telling will include reporting antisemitism in the Labour party.</p> <p>There was no one reason why the EU referendum was lost, but a major cause was that liberal Conservatives and the soft left of the Labour party could not jointly come together passionately to express their joint commitment to the Enlightenment principles on which not only the EU \u2013 but Britain \u2013 is founded. If David Cameron had been more prepared to take on his Brexit right and had Labour been led by a figure from the Enlightenment left, a common platform might have been created. But neither precondition held.</p> <p>My fear now is that exactly the same forces are going to engulf the BBC. If it is <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-bbc-licence-fee-over-75s-a9078471.html\" title=\"\">forced to fund</a> the \u00a3745m annual cost of free licences for the over-75s \u2013 the deal forced on it by George Osborne in 2015 \u2013 swingeing cuts will follow.

      "bodyText": "The most alarming feature of our times is the disintegration of a shared belief in the values and principles of the European Enlightenment. They were never shouted from the hilltops, but were key to what we used to hold in common, and their collapse was a chief cause of Brexit. Unless they are quickly rediscovered and seen as a point around which to reunite, the BBC will now fall as well. Enlightenment values come in an interconnected bundle. First and foremost is the idea that there are objective truths and an accompanying public realm, held for all citizens, in which these truths can be tried and tested by argument, evidence and reason. It follows that there must be freedom to think and freely express oneself \u2013 otherwise no argument is possible. Science and fact will thus trump partisan ideology and superstition. This creates a public interest, expressed by government, that is held to account by equal citizens who can turn to law and independent judges to protect them. Thus the EU\u2019s treaties, and thus the BBC\u2019s public service obligation to educate, impartially inform and entertain every citizen. It is a cornerstone of the public realm. Rightwing populism confounds these principles. Conceptually, it holds, the public realm is a fraud: there is only an aggregation of individuals whose fate is to pursue their own interest. There can be no resolution or common ground achieved by argument; my truth is the only truth. Impartiality and public service are myths. Science can only be tolerated if it delivers conclusions with which I agree. Law and judges who get in the way of the popular will should be brushed aside. Only my views should be freely expressed. Christian faith is inherently superior to any other, which can be mocked and derided. The EU with its acquis communautaire celebrating the rule of law is anathema. So, too, is the BBC \u2013 an Enlightenment stronghold daring to pretend it can embody public service broadcasting and an imagined impartiality which disguises that it is the natural enemy of rightwing Toryism with its anti-Enlightenment roots. It is the populist libertarian values of Fox News or Britain\u2019s rightwing press \u2013 intolerant of difference \u2013 that are inherently those the right should champion. Populists of the left hold mirror-image beliefs. There is not a public realm; \u201cpublicness\u201d can only be expressed in a socialist collective in which notions of public and private are dissolved. The public interest can only be the socialist interest. Socialist law is founded on socialist jurisprudence. Elections are essentially only useful to validate one socialist choice. Thus Momentum\u2019s leader, Jon Lansman, can organise a ballot to test his members\u2019 views in which only one candidate can be voted for \u2013 Rebecca Long-Bailey. Thus Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s hostility to an EU whose Enlightenment treaties might obstruct the creation of a socialist collective, and his instinctive distrust of a BBC whose commitment to truth-telling will include reporting antisemitism in the Labour party. There was no one reason why the EU referendum was lost, but a major cause was that liberal Conservatives and the soft left of the Labour party could not jointly come together passionately to express their joint commitment to the Enlightenment principles on which not only the EU \u2013 but Britain \u2013 is founded. If David Cameron had been more prepared to take on his Brexit right and had Labour been led by a figure from the Enlightenment left, a common platform might have been created. But neither precondition held. My fear now is that exactly the same forces are going to engulf the BBC. If it is forced to fund the \u00a3745m annual cost of free licences for the over-75s \u2013 the deal forced on it by George Osborne in 2015 \u2013 swingeing cuts will follow. Public service broadcasting, already under intense pressure, will look second- or even third-best. Popular support will ebb away. And though I\u2019d like the licence fee arrangement to hold, the BBC won\u2019t be \u201cfreed\u201d to become subscription-based, a second-best option, in the charter review of 2027: that might be too successful. Instead, it will be kept on a tight leash, with neither mainstream liberal Tories, nor the best in a marginalised, gravely weakened Labour party having the political heft or inner conviction to save it. David Clementi, the BBC chairman, was absolutely right last week to agree with the director general, Tony Hall, that he should step down at least two years earlier than he planned. Hall\u2019s love for the BBC is total, but the leader who agreed the fatally damaging deal cannot now be the leader who must try to muster the forces to change it. Boris Johnson, already trimming on a hard Brexit because it is so damaging to the Midlands and northern constituencies he has so recently won, has got to throw his Brexit right some red meat.

      "body": "<p>My name is Jamie and I\u2019m a cheat. This is my confession.</p> <p>As with most things today, the internet is largely to blame. Initially, I started exploring online forums, seeking others with my own niche interests. Much of the stuff was pretty hardcore. Some swore that regular doses of beetroot juice could boost my performance. Others suggested forgoing meat. Perhaps experimenting at altitude might help.</p> <p>But a consensus quickly emerged: if I wanted to run a sub-three-hour marathon, the best thing I could do was buy a pair of Nike Vaporfly shoes. With a price tag of \u00a3240 and a running life of only about 200 miles, the shoes cost anywhere between two and three times the price of others. But almost everyone swore they were worth it. As one forum dweller said: \u201cThey really are magic.\u201d</p> <p>For once, the hype matched reality. Using data taken from users of the running app Strava, the <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/18/upshot/nike-vaporfly-shoe-strava.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=25C6004EDF86CC4072F2133D394F572C&amp;gwt=pay&amp;assetType=REGIWALL\" title=\"\">reported that, yes, it was just as Nike claimed</a>: the shoes could shave about 4% off a marathon time for certain runners. For someone who runs marathons in around three hours and eight minutes, this sort of saving was the equivalent of blood-doping.</p> <p>This is because the Vaporfly combines a carbon plate and compressed foam to give runners incredible returns on energy expended.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e966fdc3e089a12b9d4bd94ec504db8daf9839c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e966fdc3e089a12b9d4bd94ec504db8daf9839c3/0_0_3488_5184/673.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Doward in training\" width=\"673\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Doward in training in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The greatest marathon runner of all time, Eliud Kipchoge, used a variant of the Vaporfly when he ran his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/12/eliud-kipchoge-makes-history-sub-two-hour-marathon\" title=\"\">sub</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/12/eliud-kipchoge-makes-history-sub-two-hour-marathon\" title=\"\">-two-hour marathon last year</a>. The next day, Brigid Kosgei ran 2:14.04 at the Chicago marathon in a pair of modified Vaporflys, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/13/brigid-kosgei-world-marathon-record-paula-radcliffe-chicago\" title=\"\">taking 81 seconds off Paula Radcliffe\u2019s 16-year-old world record</a>.</p> <p>These performances have had a seismic effect on the running-shoe market. When they first went on sale, the Vaporfly 4% \u2013 the first iteration of the shoe \u2013 sold out so quickly that pairs were going for more than \u00a31,000 on the resale market.</p> <p>Struggling to justify that price to myself, I bagged a pair of the 4%\u2019s cheaper cousin, the Zoom Fly 2 Flyknit, which, at \u00a3140 (at the time) were still a good \u00a350 more than I\u2019d ever spent on a pair of running shoes.</p> <p>But, like the Vaporfly, they had a carbon plate, and the difference this made was immediately apparent. I ran the Pisa marathon in three hours 17 seconds, shaving more than seven minutes off my personal best.</p> <p>To be clear: there were many factors at play on that day and I\u2019m not suggesting the shoes benefit everyone. Many runners claim that the shoes reward more efficient, faster runners who have spent several years chasing personal bests. Reviews suggest<a href=\"https://www.freerunspeed.com/nike-vapor-fly-4-good-for-all-runners/\" title=\"\"> they are not great for regular training </a>at a slower pace. But it\u2019s clear they gave me a significant boost.</p> <p>Too significant, apparently.</p> <p>The world athletics ruling body is preparing to tighten regulations governing shoe technology, according<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-athletics-shoe/nikes-vaporfly-running-shoes-and-tumbling-records-idUSKBN1ZN0MJ\" title=\"\"> to two sources who spoke to</a> Reuters. World Athletics is expected to make the announcement when it unveils the findings of a review at the end of the month.</p> <p>\u201cWorld Athletics definitely agrees that there needs to be greater clarity on what is permissible in elite sport and in our competitions,\u201d it said in a statement to Reuters, adding that any change would need to be ratified by its council.</p> <p>A spokeswoman told the <em>Observer</em> that no decision had been reached on what changes, if any, would be proposed. \u201cThere is still to-ing and fro-ing as to what is going to happen,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d224e863dfdc913280f4cb4c9b4b09b01a880806\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d224e863dfdc913280f4cb4c9b4b09b01a880806/0_0_3500_2261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eliud Kipchoge used the Vaporfly system for his historic sub-two-hour marathon last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eliud Kipchoge used the Vaporfly system for his historic sub-two-hour marathon last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisi Niesner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One option, suggested by industry experts, is for limits to be set on the depth of foam and the amount of carbon in shoes used in elite competition.</p> <p>Regulations state that any shoe \u201cmust be reasonably available to all in the spirit of the universality of athletics and must not be constructed so as to give athletes any unfair assistance or advantage\u201d.</p> <p>But the genie is out of the bottle. The\u00f8 focus is on Nike because it got there first.

      "bodyText": "My name is Jamie and I\u2019m a cheat. This is my confession. As with most things today, the internet is largely to blame. Initially, I started exploring online forums, seeking others with my own niche interests. Much of the stuff was pretty hardcore. Some swore that regular doses of beetroot juice could boost my performance. Others suggested forgoing meat. Perhaps experimenting at altitude might help. But a consensus quickly emerged: if I wanted to run a sub-three-hour marathon, the best thing I could do was buy a pair of Nike Vaporfly shoes. With a price tag of \u00a3240 and a running life of only about 200 miles, the shoes cost anywhere between two and three times the price of others. But almost everyone swore they were worth it. As one forum dweller said: \u201cThey really are magic.\u201d For once, the hype matched reality. Using data taken from users of the running app Strava, the New York Times reported that, yes, it was just as Nike claimed: the shoes could shave about 4% off a marathon time for certain runners. For someone who runs marathons in around three hours and eight minutes, this sort of saving was the equivalent of blood-doping. This is because the Vaporfly combines a carbon plate and compressed foam to give runners incredible returns on energy expended. The greatest marathon runner of all time, Eliud Kipchoge, used a variant of the Vaporfly when he ran his sub-two-hour marathon last year. The next day, Brigid Kosgei ran 2:14.04 at the Chicago marathon in a pair of modified Vaporflys, taking 81 seconds off Paula Radcliffe\u2019s 16-year-old world record. These performances have had a seismic effect on the running-shoe market. When they first went on sale, the Vaporfly 4% \u2013 the first iteration of the shoe \u2013 sold out so quickly that pairs were going for more than \u00a31,000 on the resale market. Struggling to justify that price to myself, I bagged a pair of the 4%\u2019s cheaper cousin, the Zoom Fly 2 Flyknit, which, at \u00a3140 (at the time) were still a good \u00a350 more than I\u2019d ever spent on a pair of running shoes. But, like the Vaporfly, they had a carbon plate, and the difference this made was immediately apparent. I ran the Pisa marathon in three hours 17 seconds, shaving more than seven minutes off my personal best. To be clear: there were many factors at play on that day and I\u2019m not suggesting the shoes benefit everyone. Many runners claim that the shoes reward more efficient, faster runners who have spent several years chasing personal bests. Reviews suggest they are not great for regular training at a slower pace. But it\u2019s clear they gave me a significant boost. Too significant, apparently. The world athletics ruling body is preparing to tighten regulations governing shoe technology, according to two sources who spoke to Reuters. World Athletics is expected to make the announcement when it unveils the findings of a review at the end of the month. \u201cWorld Athletics definitely agrees that there needs to be greater clarity on what is permissible in elite sport and in our competitions,\u201d it said in a statement to Reuters, adding that any change would need to be ratified by its council. A spokeswoman told the Observer that no decision had been reached on what changes, if any, would be proposed. \u201cThere is still to-ing and fro-ing as to what is going to happen,\u201d she said. One option, suggested by industry experts, is for limits to be set on the depth of foam and the amount of carbon in shoes used in elite competition. Regulations state that any shoe \u201cmust be reasonably available to all in the spirit of the universality of athletics and must not be constructed so as to give athletes any unfair assistance or advantage\u201d. But the genie is out of the bottle. The\u00f8 focus is on Nike because it got there first. But the French shoe company Hoka One One now has two pairs with a carbon plate, while New Balance has its own version, the FuelCell 5280, aimed at mile runners. This month, several elite runners sponsored by Adidas were photographed at the Houston half marathon sporting a prototype shoe that also appears to boast a carbon fibre plate. Other brands must surely be looking to follow Nike\u2019s lead. Regardless of what World Athletics decides, such shoes will, in some people\u2019s minds, be associated with giving runners an unfair advantage. Bryce Dyer, a sports technologist and specialist in product design at Bournemouth University, told Reuters they were \u201cthe equivalent of bringing a gun to a knife fight\u201d. Others draw comparisons with Speedo\u2019s controversial LZR swimsuit, which helped competitors break a host of world records in the pool before being banned. The backlash against the shoes began in running forums almost immediately after their launch. \u201cLike putting springs on your feet,\u201d one person said. \u201cShould be banned.\u201d Now, as the debate moves from the online world to the real one, amateur runners face an ethical dilemma: should they race in shoes fitted with the new technology or switch to avoid being accused of engaging in what Yannis Pitsiladis, a professor of sport and exercise science at Brighton University, suggested to Reuters was \u201ctechnological doping\u201d?

      "body": "<p>Last week, with the end of the UK\u2019s 47-year membership of the club of European nations just days away, I looked back at some newspaper cuttings from my time as a Brussels correspondent. A picture of worried-looking farmers eyeing up their cattle at a market in Banbury stared out alongside banner headlines. \u201cBritish beef banned in Europe. Cattle prices fall. School meals hit. EU \u2018rules\u2019 broken.\u201d Among the many crises in British relations with the EU down the years \u2013 from Margaret Thatcher\u2019s bust-up over the European budget in the early 1980s to the UK\u2019s exit from the ERM in 1992 \u2013 the beef war between London and Brussels ranks among the biggest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/26/how-will-brexit-change-lives-eurostar-interviews\">The nation now leaving platform one \u2026 views from the Eurostar on Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was 29 March, 1996, and the European commission had just announced a worldwide ban on the export of British beef. The EU\u2019s executive opted for decisive action after the Tory government admitted there could be a link between \u201cmad cow\u201d disease and the mutant strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which could kill humans. I had been in Brussels less than three months. It was a huge<strong> </strong>story, and reading through articles I had written at the time, it felt like yesterday. But what was most striking, as my mind fixed again on events of 24 years ago, was how relevant that one prolonged and tortuous episode seemed today, in the context of Brexit.</p> <p>When the European commission dropped its bombshell, France and Germany had already imposed their own unilateral bans on British beef. UK ministers had announced that millions of cattle across the UK would have to be slaughtered. Thousands of schools took meat off their lunch menus. Beef prices tumbled. Inevitably, in those testy post-Maastricht days of Tory rows over Europe, Eurosceptic MPs blamed the Europeans. The late Sir Teddy Taylor, a hardline anti-EU campaigner on the Conservative backbenches, urged retaliation in the form of a ban on French wine and French beef, while Bill Cash, still a Tory MP to this day, wanted to take the European commission to court.</p> <p>Throughout that spring and summer, the crisis widened. This was a time when the ambitions of the EU\u2019s true believers in Brussels, Bonn and Paris were at their height. Helmut Kohl and Jacques Chirac were planning the launch of the euro, for the big leap towards political and monetary union that the Maastricht treaty had charted a course. Europe\u2019s leaders were preparing also to admit several countries of former communist eastern Europe. The enlargement project was one of which the UK thoroughly approved. The British government believed in a Europe that was \u201cwider not deeper\u201d.</p> <p>But John Major, who had launched his premiership in 1990 with a promise to put Britain \u201cat the heart of Europe\u201d, found himself trapped politically as the BSE disaster worsened. The rightwing tabloids were in full anti-EU cry, demanding he fight the beef ban like he was Margaret Thatcher. In an editorial at the end of March, the <em>Sun</em> warned that the survival of an independent UK, no less, was at stake: \u201cIf Brussels has the power to stop Britain from selling a product anywhere in the world, then we are no longer an independent sovereign nation with control over our own affairs,\u201d the paper said. \u201cWe are just one of the herd. John Bull has been neutered.\u201d</p> <p>Back home, Tony Blair and New Labour were racing ahead in the polls. On 21 May, Major went for broke and, to try to calm the \u201cbastards\u201d in his own party, announced that the UK would refuse to co-operate in EU meetings until further notice. British non-co-operation with Europe \u2013 and its policies \u2013 had become official policy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"397d87ffc2d15abe92e14fba594a1b51eb1c0a6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/397d87ffc2d15abe92e14fba594a1b51eb1c0a6c/0_0_2480_3098/801.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>16 April 1975</strong> \u201cWe are inextricably part of Europe.

In areas where British ministers had a veto in council meetings, non-co-operation meant they would effectively be blocking EU decisions, thwarting European plans for deeper integration. In mid-May 1996 Major told the House of Commons: \u201cWithout progress towards lifting the ban we cannot be expected to cooperate normally on other Community business. We cannot continue business as usual within Europe when we are faced with the clear disregard by some of our partners of reason, of common sense and of Britain\u2019s national interest.\u201d</p> <p>Non co-operation quickly took relations between London and Brussels to a historic low. For the first time in more than two decades serious questions were being asked about Britain\u2019s membership, publicly, by senior British and European politicians. The beef crisis in itself was an isolated, very specific issue. But the way it had spiralled had highlighted deep faultlines in a relationship between a member state determined not to cede powers, and much of whose media was virulently anti-Brussels, and the proponents of a postwar European project that had as its entire purpose the unification of Europe, and the necessary surrender by participants of ever more sovereignty to the centre.</p> <p>EU leaders were beginning to wonder if the UK could continue as a full member if it was prepared to put spanners in the works of integration whenever it had a grievance. In a newspaper article in early June 1996 the then European commission president Jacques Santer warned that \u201c<em>l\u2019heure de v\u00e9rit\u00e9</em>\u201d was approaching. The late Sir Leon Brittan, then the UK\u2019s commissioner, sensing a potentially disastrous breach, told UK businessmen in the same week to start speaking up for Europe \u201cif we are not to be lured, step by insidious step, on the dangerous path towards leaving the European Union\u201d.</p> <p>This coming Friday, 31 January, at midnight in Brussels, and 11pm UK time, it will all be over. The worst fears of the pro-Europeans here and on the continent will have been realised. The Union flag will be lowered overnight, discreetly at the European parliament buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg and at the UK representation in Brussels. The UK will be out. The flag that will fly until Friday in the EU capital\u2019s parliament building will be moved to the <a href=\"https://historia-europa.ep.eu/en/welcome-house-european-history\" title=\"\">House of European History</a><a href=\"https://historia-europa.ep.eu/en/welcome-house-european-history\" title=\"\"> museum</a> nearby. British membership will thereafter be a piece of history on display. In London, Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative government will project the moment as the beginning of a new dawn. No 10 will stage a special lights display at 11pm. Ten million commemorative 50p coins will come into circulation before the end of the year. Johnson will be one of the first to receive one.</p> <p>For those of us who have spent so many years watching the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU closely, the final act of leaving will be hard to take in. In the minds of everyone in the EU who had always wanted the relationship to succeed, there will always be deep regrets, and questions that can never fully be answered. Could it have worked? If so, was the EU or the UK, or were both, to blame? Which British and EU leaders fell short? Or was it always doomed to failure?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"06da53a15ee41fedf22e4489c08703cf55ac56c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06da53a15ee41fedf22e4489c08703cf55ac56c5/0_226_5209_3126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Major\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>October 1992</strong> John Major calls for the UK to remain at the heart of Europe in his leader\u2019s speech at Tory conference.\u201cThere is nothing that can stir the heart like the history of this country.

I want Britain to mould that change, to lead that change in our own national interest. That\u2019s what I mean by being at the heart of Europe.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As we prepare to leave, I asked diplomats, politicians, journalists on both sides of the channel why they thought Brexit had come to pass and they cited a multitude of reasons. The deep differences in postwar attitudes between the UK and its European partners; poor leadership in the EU and UK; a constantly hostile British media, and sheer bad luck and timing.</p> <p>Sir Nigel Sheinwald, a former UK ambassador to the EU and Washington, believes all these factors played their parts. \u201cEurope always seemed a matter of choice, not necessity for the UK, unlike for France and Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cSuccessive generations of British political leaders failed to explain the realities and the centrality of our membership, preferring to live with, rather than confront, decades of British media little-Englandism. Then the short-term perfect storm \u2013 the impact of the financial crisis, the anti-establishment mood, and the open goal left by Cameron\u2019s casual failure of leadership and Corbyn\u2019s Euroscepticism.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit was never inevitable, and the irony is that we are leaving an organisation more aligned than at any time since we joined with the British priorities of free trade, competition, active and responsible international policies, and cooperation on security.\u201d</p> <p>The German MP Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, who chairs the foreign affairs committee in the Bundestag, suggested the idea of the UK leaving was always so alien and nightmarish for EU leaders that they blinded themselves to the warning signals. By the time of the 2016 referendum the chance to find compromise had been lost.</p> <p>\u201cFor the EU it was unimaginable that a country might choose to leave the union,\u201d R\u00f6ttgen said. \u201cAs a consequence they underestimated the severity of the situation and gave David Cameron nothing to work with during the referendum. To be fair, given all the opt-outs the UK already had, that would not have been easy, but the EU\u2019s lack of trying was a mistake.\u201d The German MEP David McAllister, born to a Scottish father and German mother, and who was bought up in West Berlin, says the UK\u2019s decision to opt out of the euro and Schengen open borders agreement was a turning point which took the UK down a road to disengagement from the core. \u201cThe beginning of the end was Maastricht. Not joining the two biggest projects, the joint currency and Schengen.\u201d But enlargement to the east \u2013 which, ironically, the UK had championed \u2013 also played its part, he believes, creating huge new issues around freedom of movement which the UK could not resolve with its partners before the eventual referendum. \u201cFree movement was vital for those new members and they did not want to give way.\u201d</p> <p>As in any marriage there were happier times. After Edward Heath had taken the UK into the European Economic Community in 1973, successive prime ministers \u2013 Thatcher, Major, Blair, Gordon Brown \u2013 all entered office proclaiming themselves strong Europeans. Even Cameron said he wanted his party to stop \u201cbanging on\u201d about Europe. In 1975, addressing the Conservative Group for Europe, before the confirmatory referendum later that year, Thatcher proudly proclaimed her pro-EC views, and taunted Labour over its European divisions. \u201cWe are inextricably part of Europe,\u201d she said. \u201cNeither Mr Foot nor Mr Benn nor anyone else will ever be able to take us \u2018out of Europe\u2019, for Europe is where we are and where have always been,\u201d she declared.</p> <p>But for every UK prime minister since the 1970s, rows with Europe were always round the corner. In her first years in No 10 Thatcher fought and won a bruising battle to cut the UK\u2019s payments to the European budget, before securing the EU rebate at Fontainbleu in 1984. After that, however, she was a tireless champion of the European single market, before falling out with Jacques Delors and Helmut Kohl over their plans for full monetary union in the late 1980s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4e35e3ffb57226f54e7bed2154ddca2d85cfe146\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e35e3ffb57226f54e7bed2154ddca2d85cfe146/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cameron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>23 January 2013</strong> David Cameron announces a referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union.\u201cWe will give the British people a referendum with a very simple in or out choice.

After 1984, however, it was more positive as she drove the single market forward. Then she felt betrayed over the single currency.\u201d But he insists she never contemplated leaving the EU.</p> <p>Many in the EU believe it was Thatcher who set the direction of travel. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/19/guy-verhofstadt-brexit-interview-nationalists-london-european-elections\" title=\"\">Guy Verhofstadt</a>, the former Belgian prime minister, says she introduced the idea of \u201cexceptionalism\u201d (rebates and opt-outs) which undermined Europe\u2019s unity and efficiency.</p> <p>\u201cIt started with the rebate of Thatcher,\u201d he said. \u201cBy granting something like the rebate you encourage those who don\u2019t want or like the basic story of the European Union. The consequence is that the EU is not effective because of these exceptions. It cannot act there, it can only partially act here. That then fuels the Eurosceptics again, who say \u2018you see it doesn\u2019t work!\u2019 By creating these exceptions we planted a seed to make the EU ineffective, and for the exiteers to make their case.\u201d</p> <p>For Major, who succeeded Thatcher, the crises never ceased. The UK\u2019s exit from the ERM in autumn 1992 was one from which he never really recovered. He fought and secured the single currency opt-out from Maastricht but the \u201cbastards\u201d in his party never let up. In the later days of his administration he tried to convince EU leaders to adopt ideas for a two-speed Europe in which the UK would be in the slower lane but, by that stage, they were waiting for Blair to win the 1997 election and open a new period of positive relations.</p> <p>I can remember the excitement in EU circles at Blair\u2019s first European summit in late May 1997 after 18 years of Thatcher and Major. At that meeting in Noordwijk in the Netherlands the Italian news agency, Ansa, headed its main report \u201cTony Blair, Superstar\u201d and Italian journalists called it \u201cBlair day in Europe\u201d. Labour\u2019s election manifesto had left open the possibility of the UK joining the euro when the conditions were right. Blair was genuine and serious about wanting to change the mood.</p> <p>But he had won the support of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s newspapers, including the <em>Sun</em>, for the 1997 election and Alastair Campbell clearly spotted danger. Campbell arrived on the European scene appearing disdainful, no doubt deliberately, of many of the EU\u2019s complex and arcane debates, describing them as \u201ceurobollocks\u201d, because he feared a tabloid backlash if Blair was too pro-EU.</p> <p>At the same meeting in Noordwijk he accused me of \u201cgoing native\u201d for writing about voting systems in the EU, which he had not by then got his head around.</p> <p>There was a smugness about the Blair administration \u2013 remarked on by his own officials at the time \u2013 in its early dealings with the EU, which infuriated European leaders. Within months, rows blew up between Blair and Brown on the UK side, and Kohl and Chirac on the other, as the UK demanded the right to be present at meetings of European finance ministers whose countries had agreed to join the euro, despite the UK having refused to commit itself to entry.</p> <p>At one summit in Luxembourg, Chirac became so irritated that he told Blair he would have to learn to bow his head three times to the <em>tricolore</em> before he could earn his spurs in the EU. The greatest frustration came when EU leaders realised that Brown had, with his adviser Ed Balls, designed a foolproof means of blocking Blair from joining the euro, through his five tests. Verhofstadt and other leaders say Blair, whose relations with Chirac and others deteriorated further with the Iraq war, had a chance to change the course of history but fell short. </p> <p>And so after Brown\u2019s difficult premiership, in which he promoted his ideas of Britishness far more than any European vision, came Cameron, who had launched his bid for the Tory leadership with a pledge to take the UK out of the main centre-right grouping, the European People\u2019s party, positioning himself initially as a firm Eurosceptic. When he called the 2016 in/out referendum he promised to renegotiate a better deal for the UK in the EU that he hoped would persuade people to vote to remain.

      "bodyText": "Last week, with the end of the UK\u2019s 47-year membership of the club of European nations just days away, I looked back at some newspaper cuttings from my time as a Brussels correspondent. A picture of worried-looking farmers eyeing up their cattle at a market in Banbury stared out alongside banner headlines. \u201cBritish beef banned in Europe. Cattle prices fall. School meals hit. EU \u2018rules\u2019 broken.\u201d Among the many crises in British relations with the EU down the years \u2013 from Margaret Thatcher\u2019s bust-up over the European budget in the early 1980s to the UK\u2019s exit from the ERM in 1992 \u2013 the beef war between London and Brussels ranks among the biggest. It was 29 March, 1996, and the European commission had just announced a worldwide ban on the export of British beef. The EU\u2019s executive opted for decisive action after the Tory government admitted there could be a link between \u201cmad cow\u201d disease and the mutant strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which could kill humans. I had been in Brussels less than three months. It was a huge story, and reading through articles I had written at the time, it felt like yesterday. But what was most striking, as my mind fixed again on events of 24 years ago, was how relevant that one prolonged and tortuous episode seemed today, in the context of Brexit. When the European commission dropped its bombshell, France and Germany had already imposed their own unilateral bans on British beef. UK ministers had announced that millions of cattle across the UK would have to be slaughtered. Thousands of schools took meat off their lunch menus. Beef prices tumbled. Inevitably, in those testy post-Maastricht days of Tory rows over Europe, Eurosceptic MPs blamed the Europeans. The late Sir Teddy Taylor, a hardline anti-EU campaigner on the Conservative backbenches, urged retaliation in the form of a ban on French wine and French beef, while Bill Cash, still a Tory MP to this day, wanted to take the European commission to court. Throughout that spring and summer, the crisis widened. This was a time when the ambitions of the EU\u2019s true believers in Brussels, Bonn and Paris were at their height. Helmut Kohl and Jacques Chirac were planning the launch of the euro, for the big leap towards political and monetary union that the Maastricht treaty had charted a course. Europe\u2019s leaders were preparing also to admit several countries of former communist eastern Europe. The enlargement project was one of which the UK thoroughly approved. The British government believed in a Europe that was \u201cwider not deeper\u201d. But John Major, who had launched his premiership in 1990 with a promise to put Britain \u201cat the heart of Europe\u201d, found himself trapped politically as the BSE disaster worsened. The rightwing tabloids were in full anti-EU cry, demanding he fight the beef ban like he was Margaret Thatcher. In an editorial at the end of March, the Sun warned that the survival of an independent UK, no less, was at stake: \u201cIf Brussels has the power to stop Britain from selling a product anywhere in the world, then we are no longer an independent sovereign nation with control over our own affairs,\u201d the paper said. \u201cWe are just one of the herd. John Bull has been neutered.\u201d Back home, Tony Blair and New Labour were racing ahead in the polls. On 21 May, Major went for broke and, to try to calm the \u201cbastards\u201d in his own party, announced that the UK would refuse to co-operate in EU meetings until further notice. British non-co-operation with Europe \u2013 and its policies \u2013 had become official policy. It was no small move to make. In areas where British ministers had a veto in council meetings, non-co-operation meant they would effectively be blocking EU decisions, thwarting European plans for deeper integration. In mid-May 1996 Major told the House of Commons: \u201cWithout progress towards lifting the ban we cannot be expected to cooperate normally on other Community business. We cannot continue business as usual within Europe when we are faced with the clear disregard by some of our partners of reason, of common sense and of Britain\u2019s national interest.\u201d Non co-operation quickly took relations between London and Brussels to a historic low. For the first time in more than two decades serious questions were being asked about Britain\u2019s membership, publicly, by senior British and European politicians. The beef crisis in itself was an isolated, very specific issue. But the way it had spiralled had highlighted deep faultlines in a relationship between a member state determined not to cede powers, and much of whose media was virulently anti-Brussels, and the proponents of a postwar European project that had as its entire purpose the unification of Europe, and the necessary surrender by participants of ever more sovereignty to the centre. EU leaders were beginning to wonder if the UK could continue as a full member if it was prepared to put spanners in the works of integration whenever it had a grievance. In a newspaper article in early June 1996 the then European commission president Jacques Santer warned that \u201cl\u2019heure de v\u00e9rit\u00e9\u201d was approaching. The late Sir Leon Brittan, then the UK\u2019s commissioner, sensing a potentially disastrous breach, told UK businessmen in the same week to start speaking up for Europe \u201cif we are not to be lured, step by insidious step, on the dangerous path towards leaving the European Union\u201d. This coming Friday, 31 January, at midnight in Brussels, and 11pm UK time, it will all be over. The worst fears of the pro-Europeans here and on the continent will have been realised. The Union flag will be lowered overnight, discreetly at the European parliament buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg and at the UK representation in Brussels. The UK will be out. The flag that will fly until Friday in the EU capital\u2019s parliament building will be moved to the House of European History museum nearby. British membership will thereafter be a piece of history on display. In London, Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative government will project the moment as the beginning of a new dawn. No 10 will stage a special lights display at 11pm. Ten million commemorative 50p coins will come into circulation before the end of the year. Johnson will be one of the first to receive one. For those of us who have spent so many years watching the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU closely, the final act of leaving will be hard to take in. In the minds of everyone in the EU who had always wanted the relationship to succeed, there will always be deep regrets, and questions that can never fully be answered. Could it have worked? If so, was the EU or the UK, or were both, to blame? Which British and EU leaders fell short? Or was it always doomed to failure? As we prepare to leave, I asked diplomats, politicians, journalists on both sides of the channel why they thought Brexit had come to pass and they cited a multitude of reasons. The deep differences in postwar attitudes between the UK and its European partners; poor leadership in the EU and UK; a constantly hostile British media, and sheer bad luck and timing. Sir Nigel Sheinwald, a former UK ambassador to the EU and Washington, believes all these factors played their parts. \u201cEurope always seemed a matter of choice, not necessity for the UK, unlike for France and Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cSuccessive generations of British political leaders failed to explain the realities and the centrality of our membership, preferring to live with, rather than confront, decades of British media little-Englandism. Then the short-term perfect storm \u2013 the impact of the financial crisis, the anti-establishment mood, and the open goal left by Cameron\u2019s casual failure of leadership and Corbyn\u2019s Euroscepticism. \u201cBrexit was never inevitable, and the irony is that we are leaving an organisation more aligned than at any time since we joined with the British priorities of free trade, competition, active and responsible international policies, and cooperation on security.\u201d The German MP Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, who chairs the foreign affairs committee in the Bundestag, suggested the idea of the UK leaving was always so alien and nightmarish for EU leaders that they blinded themselves to the warning signals. By the time of the 2016 referendum the chance to find compromise had been lost. \u201cFor the EU it was unimaginable that a country might choose to leave the union,\u201d R\u00f6ttgen said. \u201cAs a consequence they underestimated the severity of the situation and gave David Cameron nothing to work with during the referendum. To be fair, given all the opt-outs the UK already had, that would not have been easy, but the EU\u2019s lack of trying was a mistake.\u201d The German MEP David McAllister, born to a Scottish father and German mother, and who was bought up in West Berlin, says the UK\u2019s decision to opt out of the euro and Schengen open borders agreement was a turning point which took the UK down a road to disengagement from the core. \u201cThe beginning of the end was Maastricht. Not joining the two biggest projects, the joint currency and Schengen.\u201d But enlargement to the east \u2013 which, ironically, the UK had championed \u2013 also played its part, he believes, creating huge new issues around freedom of movement which the UK could not resolve with its partners before the eventual referendum. \u201cFree movement was vital for those new members and they did not want to give way.\u201d As in any marriage there were happier times. After Edward Heath had taken the UK into the European Economic Community in 1973, successive prime ministers \u2013 Thatcher, Major, Blair, Gordon Brown \u2013 all entered office proclaiming themselves strong Europeans. Even Cameron said he wanted his party to stop \u201cbanging on\u201d about Europe. In 1975, addressing the Conservative Group for Europe, before the confirmatory referendum later that year, Thatcher proudly proclaimed her pro-EC views, and taunted Labour over its European divisions. \u201cWe are inextricably part of Europe,\u201d she said. \u201cNeither Mr Foot nor Mr Benn nor anyone else will ever be able to take us \u2018out of Europe\u2019, for Europe is where we are and where have always been,\u201d she declared. But for every UK prime minister since the 1970s, rows with Europe were always round the corner. In her first years in No 10 Thatcher fought and won a bruising battle to cut the UK\u2019s payments to the European budget, before securing the EU rebate at Fontainbleu in 1984. After that, however, she was a tireless champion of the European single market, before falling out with Jacques Delors and Helmut Kohl over their plans for full monetary union in the late 1980s. Charles Powell, her foreign policy adviser at the time, says her European enthusiasm went in phases. \u201cRather like Picasso she had her blue and her pink phases,\u201d Powell says. \u201cFor five-and-a-half years she was very awkward over the budget. After 1984, however, it was more positive as she drove the single market forward. Then she felt betrayed over the single currency.\u201d But he insists she never contemplated leaving the EU. Many in the EU believe it was Thatcher who set the direction of travel. Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, says she introduced the idea of \u201cexceptionalism\u201d (rebates and opt-outs) which undermined Europe\u2019s unity and efficiency. \u201cIt started with the rebate of Thatcher,\u201d he said. \u201cBy granting something like the rebate you encourage those who don\u2019t want or like the basic story of the European Union. The consequence is that the EU is not effective because of these exceptions. It cannot act there, it can only partially act here. That then fuels the Eurosceptics again, who say \u2018you see it doesn\u2019t work!\u2019 By creating these exceptions we planted a seed to make the EU ineffective, and for the exiteers to make their case.\u201d For Major, who succeeded Thatcher, the crises never ceased. The UK\u2019s exit from the ERM in autumn 1992 was one from which he never really recovered. He fought and secured the single currency opt-out from Maastricht but the \u201cbastards\u201d in his party never let up. In the later days of his administration he tried to convince EU leaders to adopt ideas for a two-speed Europe in which the UK would be in the slower lane but, by that stage, they were waiting for Blair to win the 1997 election and open a new period of positive relations. I can remember the excitement in EU circles at Blair\u2019s first European summit in late May 1997 after 18 years of Thatcher and Major. At that meeting in Noordwijk in the Netherlands the Italian news agency, Ansa, headed its main report \u201cTony Blair, Superstar\u201d and Italian journalists called it \u201cBlair day in Europe\u201d. Labour\u2019s election manifesto had left open the possibility of the UK joining the euro when the conditions were right. Blair was genuine and serious about wanting to change the mood. But he had won the support of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s newspapers, including the Sun, for the 1997 election and Alastair Campbell clearly spotted danger. Campbell arrived on the European scene appearing disdainful, no doubt deliberately, of many of the EU\u2019s complex and arcane debates, describing them as \u201ceurobollocks\u201d, because he feared a tabloid backlash if Blair was too pro-EU. At the same meeting in Noordwijk he accused me of \u201cgoing native\u201d for writing about voting systems in the EU, which he had not by then got his head around. There was a smugness about the Blair administration \u2013 remarked on by his own officials at the time \u2013 in its early dealings with the EU, which infuriated European leaders. Within months, rows blew up between Blair and Brown on the UK side, and Kohl and Chirac on the other, as the UK demanded the right to be present at meetings of European finance ministers whose countries had agreed to join the euro, despite the UK having refused to commit itself to entry. At one summit in Luxembourg, Chirac became so irritated that he told Blair he would have to learn to bow his head three times to the tricolore before he could earn his spurs in the EU. The greatest frustration came when EU leaders realised that Brown had, with his adviser Ed Balls, designed a foolproof means of blocking Blair from joining the euro, through his five tests. Verhofstadt and other leaders say Blair, whose relations with Chirac and others deteriorated further with the Iraq war, had a chance to change the course of history but fell short. And so after Brown\u2019s difficult premiership, in which he promoted his ideas of Britishness far more than any European vision, came Cameron, who had launched his bid for the Tory leadership with a pledge to take the UK out of the main centre-right grouping, the European People\u2019s party, positioning himself initially as a firm Eurosceptic. When he called the 2016 in/out referendum he promised to renegotiate a better deal for the UK in the EU that he hoped would persuade people to vote to remain. The rest is history. He failed to secure sufficient concessions from the EU to win over fellow Tories, including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove who would campaign to leave. Cameron opened the door to a British exit and the British people walked through it on 23 June, 2016. Cameron is the name most often cited in the EU as people search for individuals to blame for Brexit. R\u00f6ttgen says: \u201cAt a critical time, when the UK needed true leadership it had poor political personnel in place. David Cameron proved to be a coward, lacking the kind of statesmanship John Major had demonstrated during his term.\u201d But R\u00f6ttgen knows, as does everyone, that it was the entire European political class that failed to stop the \u201cunimaginable\u201d happening. His fellow countryman McAllister \u2013 with British and German roots \u2013 is more mournful ahead of Brexit day. \u201cIt will be very sad,\u201d he says. \u201cI hardly know anyone who welcomes this and who will not miss the British, their pragmatism, their humour, their knowledge. January 31 will be a very emotional day. I do not want to be in Brussels on the day the Union Jack is taken down.\u201d",

That is less because they are a means of circumventing the cap, more because keeping track of open-ended loans would become an accountancy nightmare for a salary-cap manager, or SCM, an impossibility even.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But is the ascription of the lump sum of such loans as salary a fair reflection of any \u201cadvantage\u201d secured?

He was paying into a joint venture, procuring for himself a correspondent shareholding.</p> \n<p>The structure of the deal, however, was favourable to the Vunipolas and a result of their relationship with Wray, hence of their status as Saracens players. But its value to them was more in line with the amount of interest they might have been expected to pay had they sought the financing elsewhere.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/26/six-nations-championship-united-evolve\">Six Nations united in change and ready to attack new challenges | Andy Bull</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When Chris Ashton lived in the house Wray and Dominic Silvester paid \u00a3270,000 (20%) towards, the SCM (with whom this particular transaction was cleared) accounted it as worth an extra \u00a38,100 (3% of \u00a3270,000) to Ashton\u2019s salary. So this principle is recognised by the SCM. By that reckoning the \u00a31.3m lumped on to Saracens\u2019 2016-17 salary-cap year might more representatively be accounted as \u00a339,000 worth of extra salary. That would not have come with a multi-million-pound fine, nor a 35-point reduction. The beautiful irony is that Wray has had other ventures like this cleared in the past but, according to his recent statement, he changed the structure of that year\u2019s ventures on tax advice. In so doing, his investment fell foul of the regulations, precipitating something of an uplift in his tax \u2013 to the tune of millions of pounds.</p> \n<p>The accountants\u2019 role did not stop there. The \u00a3800,000 disparity between the valuation Wray sought for a 30% share in Maro Itoje\u2019s image rights and the one the SCM procured when he found out about it accounts for most of the \u00a3900,000 overspend attributed to the 2018-19 salary-cap year. The panel\u2019s verdict was that they had no opinion on which was the fairer valuation \u2013 the \u00a31.6m Wray\u2019s consortium paid for the shareholding, or the \u00a3800,000 the SCM later valued it at \u2013 but they could not find the SCM\u2019s figure unreasonable. Thus the entirety of the \u00a3800,000 difference must stand as salary for that year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But even if one felt the SCM\u2019s to be the only appropriate valuation (and the report tells us Itoje\u2019s accountant valued the shareholding at \u00a33m), this is not simply salary. Itoje must now pay Wray\u2019s consortium 30% of all revenue from his image rights for the rest of his life. Some think the \u00a31.6m they paid for that shareholding will prove a snip.</p> \n<p>That Wray never sought to clear these transactions before he made them is incredible \u2013 and his greatest failing. (That said, of Saracens\u2019 \u00a35.4m fine, the sum total for failing to register transactions is \u00a312,600.) This gets to the heart of the ongoing farce that is the Premiership\u2019s structure. The same chairmen who compete with each other are also governing themselves. It is reasonable to assume that none of them trusts any others. That the SCM reports to Premier Rugby\u2019s executive committee, made up of three other chairmen of Premiership clubs, even as he tries to monitor the dealings of all of them, is patently absurd, as damning an example as any of such dysfunctional governance.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/25/bristol-gloucester-premiership-match-report\">Nathan Hughes inspires convincing Bristol win over Gloucester</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There is much more to unwind in this sorry saga. The report already feels like old news, dealing with transactions in the past. The more knowledge we assume, the more we are in the dark. Why have Saracens taken relegation now? Presumably, there be more dragons hiding within their computers. Are they all close-to-the-wind arrangements similar to those in the report, or will we start to get into brown-envelope territory?</p> \n<p>There is also the matter of the leak of the report before it had been redacted. One of the key reasons for its confidentiality, however hotly contested, was to protect the identity of the players. Why did somebody choose to ignore that, just as an agreement had been reached to publish an anonymised version? The legal repercussions of the leak could prove significant and will ultimately rest at PRL\u2019s door. English rugby sinks further into a mire of its own making. It feels all too familiar to anyone resident on this troubled isle. But, as with that other torturous saga, there comes a point when one just wishes it could all be over.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is nothing like a salary-cap crisis for holding the mirror up to each and every one of us. In a not-dissimilar effect to that of Brexit, our opinions on the matter, trenchant and polarised, reveal more about what we want to be true than what we know. Because what any of us knows is next to nothing. It feels as if the demographic on this might not be quite so neatly split down the middle as over Brexit, there being fewer defenders of little old Saracens than there are of the biggest trading bloc in the world conceived as a response to the horrors of two World Wars. But if a passionate Saracens-Remainer were to be pitched into a cell with a passionate Saracens-Exiter (sounds like a Premiership final) there might be blood on the sound-proof walls. Even after the release of the much-yearned-for report from the original investigation, not a lot has changed. If one is looking for evidence of Saracens chicanery, there is plenty in it; if evidence of a stitch-up against the serial champions of everything is more one\u2019s bag, there is plenty of that too. At every turn, Saracens have been engaging in transactions that are self-evidently sailing close to the wind, that are even in clear breach of the regulations as they stand, however much a multimillionaire investor used to being his own boss may disagree with them. If a loan is not repaid in the same salary-cap year it counts as salary. That is less because they are a means of circumventing the cap, more because keeping track of open-ended loans would become an accountancy nightmare for a salary-cap manager, or SCM, an impossibility even. But is the ascription of the lump sum of such loans as salary a fair reflection of any \u201cadvantage\u201d secured? Obviously not. Nigel Wray did not, say, simply give the Vunipola brothers \u00a3450,000. He was paying into a joint venture, procuring for himself a correspondent shareholding. The structure of the deal, however, was favourable to the Vunipolas and a result of their relationship with Wray, hence of their status as Saracens players. But its value to them was more in line with the amount of interest they might have been expected to pay had they sought the financing elsewhere. When Chris Ashton lived in the house Wray and Dominic Silvester paid \u00a3270,000 (20%) towards, the SCM (with whom this particular transaction was cleared) accounted it as worth an extra \u00a38,100 (3% of \u00a3270,000) to Ashton\u2019s salary. So this principle is recognised by the SCM. By that reckoning the \u00a31.3m lumped on to Saracens\u2019 2016-17 salary-cap year might more representatively be accounted as \u00a339,000 worth of extra salary. That would not have come with a multi-million-pound fine, nor a 35-point reduction. The beautiful irony is that Wray has had other ventures like this cleared in the past but, according to his recent statement, he changed the structure of that year\u2019s ventures on tax advice. In so doing, his investment fell foul of the regulations, precipitating something of an uplift in his tax \u2013 to the tune of millions of pounds. The accountants\u2019 role did not stop there. The \u00a3800,000 disparity between the valuation Wray sought for a 30% share in Maro Itoje\u2019s image rights and the one the SCM procured when he found out about it accounts for most of the \u00a3900,000 overspend attributed to the 2018-19 salary-cap year. The panel\u2019s verdict was that they had no opinion on which was the fairer valuation \u2013 the \u00a31.6m Wray\u2019s consortium paid for the shareholding, or the \u00a3800,000 the SCM later valued it at \u2013 but they could not find the SCM\u2019s figure unreasonable. Thus the entirety of the \u00a3800,000 difference must stand as salary for that year. But even if one felt the SCM\u2019s to be the only appropriate valuation (and the report tells us Itoje\u2019s accountant valued the shareholding at \u00a33m), this is not simply salary. Itoje must now pay Wray\u2019s consortium 30% of all revenue from his image rights for the rest of his life. Some think the \u00a31.6m they paid for that shareholding will prove a snip. That Wray never sought to clear these transactions before he made them is incredible \u2013 and his greatest failing. (That said, of Saracens\u2019 \u00a35.4m fine, the sum total for failing to register transactions is \u00a312,600.) This gets to the heart of the ongoing farce that is the Premiership\u2019s structure. The same chairmen who compete with each other are also governing themselves. It is reasonable to assume that none of them trusts any others. That the SCM reports to Premier Rugby\u2019s executive committee, made up of three other chairmen of Premiership clubs, even as he tries to monitor the dealings of all of them, is patently absurd, as damning an example as any of such dysfunctional governance. There is much more to unwind in this sorry saga. The report already feels like old news, dealing with transactions in the past. The more knowledge we assume, the more we are in the dark. Why have Saracens taken relegation now? Presumably, there be more dragons hiding within their computers. Are they all close-to-the-wind arrangements similar to those in the report, or will we start to get into brown-envelope territory? There is also the matter of the leak of the report before it had been redacted. One of the key reasons for its confidentiality, however hotly contested, was to protect the identity of the players. Why did somebody choose to ignore that, just as an agreement had been reached to publish an anonymised version? The legal repercussions of the leak could prove significant and will ultimately rest at PRL\u2019s door. English rugby sinks further into a mire of its own making. It feels all too familiar to anyone resident on this troubled isle. But, as with that other torturous saga, there comes a point when one just wishes it could all be over.",

So if an ambitious club is seeking to draw a significant neutral following, particularly in the ever-expanding foreign market, it is simply not enough to win. They have to win in style. This is why it was so critical for Manchester City, in trying to become a \u201cglobal brand\u201d, to adopt a bold and attractive way of playing.

They are good figures, any international all-rounder would be proud of them, but they are not exactly exceptional. However, that\u2019s the only word to describe Stokes the player. Anyone who has watched him over the past year knows that, regardless of his averages. Young kids will view his exploits on YouTube, or perhaps in 3D holograms in the future, long after their numerical breakdown disappears into the dusty annals. And it\u2019s hard to believe players are unaware of this wholesale capture of their abilities.</p> <p>Last week it was reported Spurs players had voiced their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/23/toby-alderweireld-tottenham-too-nice\" title=\"\">frustration with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s training methods</a>. Mourinho is the ultimate results-based coach. If he ever receives criticism, he reminds his audience of all the titles his teams have won. His are unquestionably remarkable achievements and yet his players are apparently complaining about the focus on long balls, flick-ons and throw-ins, which they are said to have described as \u201clower-league\u201d sessions. It\u2019s likely they wouldn\u2019t be making mutinous noises if the new tactics were paying dividends.</p> <p>But there is also an awareness that such crude tactics are losing their place in the modern game. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re necessarily ineffective \u2013 though Mourinho has enjoyed increasingly limited success with them in recent years \u2013 so much as that they\u2019re unattractive. Players who have grown up being able to watch Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo each week cannot fail to be acutely conscious of the aesthetics of football. They may all want to win medals but they also want to win the admiration of their fellow professionals, to say nothing of the fans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s possible the highly technical advance of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool and Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City and, to some extent, Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s Spurs turns out to be merely part of a cycle that will lead sooner or later back to a more fundamentalist approach.</p> <p>In which case, English football will take a step backwards in time.

They are good figures, any international all-rounder would be proud of them, but they are not exactly exceptional. However, that\u2019s the only word to describe Stokes the player. Anyone who has watched him over the past year knows that, regardless of his averages. Young kids will view his exploits on YouTube, or perhaps in 3D holograms in the future, long after their numerical breakdown disappears into the dusty annals. And it\u2019s hard to believe players are unaware of this wholesale capture of their abilities. Last week it was reported Spurs players had voiced their frustration with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s training methods. Mourinho is the ultimate results-based coach. If he ever receives criticism, he reminds his audience of all the titles his teams have won. His are unquestionably remarkable achievements and yet his players are apparently complaining about the focus on long balls, flick-ons and throw-ins, which they are said to have described as \u201clower-league\u201d sessions. It\u2019s likely they wouldn\u2019t be making mutinous noises if the new tactics were paying dividends. But there is also an awareness that such crude tactics are losing their place in the modern game. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re necessarily ineffective \u2013 though Mourinho has enjoyed increasingly limited success with them in recent years \u2013 so much as that they\u2019re unattractive. Players who have grown up being able to watch Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo each week cannot fail to be acutely conscious of the aesthetics of football. They may all want to win medals but they also want to win the admiration of their fellow professionals, to say nothing of the fans. It\u2019s possible the highly technical advance of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool and Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City and, to some extent, Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s Spurs turns out to be merely part of a cycle that will lead sooner or later back to a more fundamentalist approach. In which case, English football will take a step backwards in time. Because history will continue to be written, but in the digital age it\u2019s also there to be watched, and on the whole people like to be thrilled and inspired by what they see.",

      "bodyText": "When US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin threatens to impose tariffs on a country\u2019s car industry if it taxes American tech giants, you are inclined to believe that he means it. \u201cIf people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies.\u201d A trigger-happy White House, steeped in trade disputes with various economic competitors, needs little excuse for retaliation. So the British government\u2019s plan to impose a 2% sales tax on the largest digital companies \u2013 ensnaring the likes of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple \u2013 provides all the excuse President Donald Trump needs. With Trump fresh from a bloody fight with the Chinese over import tariffs that had escalated to the point of plunging US manufacturing into recession, it is understandable that many trade economists believe his appetite is satiated, at least for the moment. But this may be to underestimate Trump on the issue of the tech giants, even if an America First view of trade often means clobbering one\u2019s own side as much as the opposition. US soya growers and livestock farmers suffered steep declines in export sales after they were effectively locked out of China. A moratorium last year was only partially observed, and Trump was forced to pour much of the money earned from import tariffs into Treasury coffers for compensation payments in the agricultural sector. An import tariff is effectively a tax on goods entering the country and is supposed to give a boost to domestic firms, whose goods become relatively cheaper. But the tariff is paid by the importer, so increases costs for domestic manufacturers that use foreign-made parts. Mnuchin has been Trump\u2019s loyal lieutenant through all these battles. The former Goldman Sachs partner and Yale University graduate knows the art of the deal, probably better than his boss. It was Mnuchin who travelled to Beijing in 2017 with trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer to kick off the battle with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, starting with a 30% tariff on Chinese solar panels imported into the US. Mnuchin is understood to have been the one who reined in Lighthizer\u2019s demands that Beijing open its markets wider to the west and crack down further on state subsidies. He could see how much US firms that relied on imports from China were hurting. Yet it was only this month that the administration agreed to ease off and work on a phase one peace deal, and this happened only after some tangible concessions from the other side had been agreed. British firms are already paying punitive US tariffs following a spat between the US and Brussels over subsidies for aeroplane maker Airbus. A scattergun approach by the White House in the wake of the Airbus ruling saw the Scotch whisky industry punished last year with a 25% import tariff on bottles of single malt. In threatening to slap tariffs on the UK car industry, Mnuchin is well aware that it is in a difficult bind, with Brexit threatening exports and the need for hefty investment in electric and hybrid vehicles. The US accounts for around \u00a38bn a year of the UK\u2019s automotive exports. There is honour in not being bullied by the US. But when the French have told Mnuchin they are prepared to delay a similar digital tax, the argument for the UK to delay begins to strengthen. Mnuchin has conceded that the US should fall into line with the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development when it puts forward proposals for a global digital tax.

One way or another, the tax avoidance techniques of the major digital firms need to be tackled. If the threat of going it alone will help spur the US into accepting the OECD tax, then all the better. Why does a stint at Boots seem to make bosses hot retail recruits? You have to go back many years to find anything to admire about Boots, the high street chemist founded by Nottingham industrialist Jesse Boot. So it\u2019s surprising that today it is still regarded as a hotbed of management talent. Last week Sainsbury\u2019s said chief executive Mike Coupe \u2013 whose reputation was tarnished by last year\u2019s failed merger with Asda \u2013 would pass the baton to retail and operations director Simon Roberts in the summer. Before joining Sainsbury\u2019s in 2017, Roberts spent 15 years at M&amp;S, then 13 years at Boots. And Roberts is not the only Boots person taking the helm of a British supermarket this year: Boots lifer Ken Murphy is replacing Dave Lewis at Tesco. Both men started working in shops as teenagers, so are no strangers to the sharp end of retail. But why are the CVs of executives schooled in the 170-year-old Boots chain, now part of US conglomerate Walgreens Boots Alliance, apparently so attractive? On the surface, anyway, the business\u2019s coping tactics, as brutal forces reshape the retail industry on both sides of the Atlantic, look no better than those of established rivals. Both Roberts and Murphy, who are said to know each other well, face big strategic decisions as their discount rivals Aldi and Lidl continue to grow in stature. Lewis has stabilised Tesco, but where does it go from here? Its UK market share is still drifting downwards and its international business has largely been dismantled. Coupe\u2019s disastrous attempt to combine Sainsbury\u2019s with Asda tested the competition watchdog\u2019s appetite for mega-mergers, so Roberts, who is already credited with improving the supermarkets\u2019 performance, will need something else up his sleeve. If Boots has access to a secret retail tonic, its health benefits have been well hidden. Trump\u2019s switch into campaign mode offers a lull in the storm The coming year will lack the economic fireworks of 2019. There will be ups and downs provided by the UK-EU Brexit negotiations, but with a US president more concerned about getting himself re-elected than fighting a trade war with China, the general picture looks much more settled. All the economies worst hit by last year\u2019s almost monthly tit-for-tat hikes in import tariffs between Beijing and Washington have begun to recover. Britain, Germany and France all put in a strong performance this month as their manufacturing sectors stabilised and their service sectors broke out of a trot into a canter. Britain is a feather in every chill wind that blows around the global economy, and a degree of calm will help settle the nerves of the Bank of England\u2019s policymakers, who had looked poised to cut rates this week. Speech after speech by the finest minds in Threadneedle Street had revealed a degree of worry about the economy not seen since the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Earlier this month, the odds on an interest rate cut had shortened to the point where it seemed highly likely. A shocking collapse in retail spending in the run-up to Christmas prompted Bank governor Mark Carney to join the ranks of gloom-mongers ready to reduce borrowing costs in the hope of reviving not just the high street but all areas of a flagging economy. A first-stage agreement between the US and China on trade, combined with the cumulative impact of interest rate cuts over the past 12 months by 49 other central banks, have served to turn things around and save the Bank from taking any action itself. Donald Trump has the capacity to wreck even his own good work. Yet that seems unlikely as he moves into campaign mode. For that reason alone, the outlook for UK interest rates remains as it was: ultra-low for the next year with only small rises possible if there should be, in defiance of Brexit, spectacular growth.",

      "bodyText": "Rathfinny, East Sussex In the new wine heartlands of the South Downs, this 600-acre estate was started in 2010 and the first vintage of its Sussex sparkling wine arrived in 2018. With a tasting room and restaurant, staying here is a Napa Valley-style experience. There are also 10 en-suite rooms in the restored flint barns, including some with bunks, and prices are reasonable. A posh hostel vibe is at play here, with high thread counts and packed lunches, plus another \u2013 more casual \u2013 restaurant at the weekend, serving set meals. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a3100, rathfinnyestate.com Raasay, Kyle Waiting for a malt whisky to mature involves patience. Reached by a 25-minute ferry from the Isle of Skye, the Hebridean island of Raasay (population 161) opened its first legal distillery in 2017 and the first casks will reach maturation this year. The whisky uses barley grown on the island, and the water comes from a well that dates back to Celtic times. In the meantime, a Victorian villa has been converted into a six-bedroom hotel for the faithful. Guests can try the distillery\u2019s gin, which requires less patience and is already available, made from juniper picked on Raasay, citrus fruits and rhubarb. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a3105 B&amp;B, raasaydistillery.com The Swan, Southwold, Suffolk As an ale house, the site of the Swan predates the Adnams brewery by about 200 years, but the two have been in partnership since 1872. Style-wise, it may fit into this moneyed part of Suffolk with ease \u2013 there are plenty of velvet sofas in jewel colours and artfully scorched mackerel on offer within its generous Georgian proportions \u2013 but it\u2019s not too sanitised. The Swan still backs on to the brewery, but the neighbouring buildings also house Southwold\u2019s distillery, with spirits and liqueurs, including whisky and vodka. As well as standard tours, visitors can choose botanicals to create their own gin. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a3200 B&amp;B, theswansouthwold.co.uk Ardbeg, Islay With eight distilleries, producing some of the finest whiskies in the world, the Hebridean island of Islay is a place of pilgrimage for whisky lovers. On the south coast, the whitewashed, low-slung Ardbeg, famous for its 10-year-old single malt, was founded in 1815. Now owned by luxury behemoth LVMH, its guest accommodation is refreshingly low-key. Seaview Cottage is housed in the middle of the distillery grounds and has three bedrooms, all en suite, decorated with local furnishings and walker-friendly extras such as a drying room. Tours start at \u00a38, with a dram at the end. There\u2019s also a small caf\u00e9. \u2022 From \u00a3220 a night (for up to six people) self-catering, ardbeg.com Llanerch Vineyards, Vale of Glamorgan A former dairy farm in Hensol which started a trial-and-error form of viniculture in the 1970s, Llanerch has evolved to grow a core variety of grapes, including orion, perle, bacchus, huxelrebe, reichensteiner and the red triomphe d\u2019Alsace. The estate produces its wine with input from the acclaimed Three Choirs vineyard in Gloucestershire and has created the award-winning ortega and ros\u00e9 blends. The evolution continues with a 37-bedroom hotel and a restaurant; tours run from April to October and cost \u00a314pp. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a375 B&amp;B (some rooms are accessible), llanerch.co.uk In the Welsh Wind, Cardigan This distillery, opened in 2018 by Alex Jungmayr and Ellen Wakelam, specialises in bespoke blends of gin. Once a blend has been devised, there\u2019s a mobile still here that can be taken to weddings and other celebrations. Tastings start at \u00a325pp; bespoke gin-making sessions cost \u00a3145 for two people. Its one-bedroom Distiller\u2019s Cottage overlooking Cardigan Bay is popular with couples \u2013 many stay here to devise their own gin before a wedding. \u2022 Cottage from \u00a3100 self-catering, inthewelshwind.co.uk Gin Distillery, west London Opened in 2017, this is a working gin distillery in what was once a notorious Notting Hill boozer. There are three mid-century rooms, a bar and restaurant, and the hotel produces its own Portobello Gin from a copper still on site \u2013 ingredients include citrus, juniper, Indonesian-sourced nutmeg and orris from Italy. Think you can do better? There\u2019s a Ginstitute on site, where guests can create their own gin using a blend of botanicals. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a3150, the-distillery.london BrewDog, Aberdeen BrewDog, which started in 2007, has just opened its first hotel in the company\u2019s hometown of Aberdeen.

On his release Wong sought to use his platform to argue that what began as Hong Kong\u2019s student protest is increasingly all of our concern. Hong Kong is in many ways the test case, his book insists, not just for China to try its authoritarian muscle but also as part of a \u201cmuch broader threat to global democracy\u201d. In May 2019 Wong returned to prison for seven weeks for violating a court injunction involving the umbrella movement, nearly 6,000 of whose number had by then been arrested. His greatest regret, he joked at the time, was that he would miss the latest Marvel Avengers film. Wong had watched its predecessor many times \u2013 and seen in its subtitle a lesson for superheroes, however modest, however young, the world over. \u201cThe \u2018infinity war\u2019 that has ravaged Hong Kong for years, I\u2019m afraid, may be soon coming to a political theatre near you\u2026\u201d \u2022 Unfree Speech: The Threat to Global Democracy and Why We Must Act Now by Joshua Wong is published by Penguin (\u00a39.99) To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837",

As the success of the BBC One drama series The Trial of Christine Keeler demonstrates, interest in the affair between the teenage model and John Profumo, the war minister in Harold Macmillan\u2019s government, shows no sign of waning nearly 60 years after it shook Westminster. Now, claims that parts of an official inquiry into the affair \u2013 revealing that another minister in Macmillan\u2019s government had affairs with prostitutes \u2013 were kept secret will raise fresh questions about the extent to which the British state has prevented the truth of what really happened from emerging. A new documentary, to be screened on BBC Two at 10pm on Sunday following the final episode of the drama, examines evidence that the security service, MI5, failed to disclose that it had been working with the man at the centre of the scandal, Stephen Ward, when he was tried for living off the earnings of prostitutes in what many now believe was a show trial intended to muzzle him. The failure has been described as \u201cunconscionable\u201d by the eminent human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson, author of Stephen Ward was Innocent, OK.

In my defence, California\u2019s vintners (as they insisted on calling themselves while the rest of the world seemed happy with winegrower or producer) had been doing a good job of feeding my prejudice. Over the years, they\u2019d given the world some of its least appetising yet inexplicably high-selling brands and some of its most ludicrously overpriced and pretentious \u2018fine\u2019 wines \u2013 the latter made in an overblown style that made them the vinous equivalent of a gas-guzzling SUV.

In 2018, the bank withdrew a $300m loan to Tanzania amid concerns over its policy of expelling pregnant girls from school.

Last September, the bank approved a loan of $450m, its first since the withdrawal of funding in 2018, after Tanzania amended a law that had made it illegal to question official statistics. In his letter, Kabwe said the loan had \u201cemboldened\u201d the government and made the human rights situation worse. The new loan could provide \u201curgently needed support to Tanzania\u2019s education sector and schoolgirls in particular\u201d, rights groups acknowledged in their letter, but said the government \u201ccannot be trusted to implement this project as designed\u201d. In a country where \u201cparliament, the judiciary, the controller and auditor general and opposition parties had been neutered\u201d, said the letter, the bank had an \u201cextra obligation\u201d to act.

The problem is that his bad manners and personal nastiness appear to have infected other US government officials, spreading into the far corners of his administration. Last week\u2019s arrogant decision by Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, to summarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/23/harry-dunn-us-rejects-extradition-request-for-anne-sacoolas\" title=\"\">reject</a> a British extradition request for Anne Sacoolas, an American woman accused of causing death by dangerous driving in Northamptonshire last year, is a case in point.</p> <p>Pompeo is no diplomat. Like his boss, he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/04/mike-pompeo-bully-boy-calls-at-no-10\" title=\"\">thuggish tendencies</a>. In comparison, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is calm and polite. He was only recently in Washington, papering over cracks caused by the illegal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/jan/10/why-did-trump-order-the-killing-of-irans-qassem-suleimani-video-explainer\" title=\"\">US assassination</a> of Iran\u2019s Qassem Suleimani. But even Raab was moved to condemn the Sacoolas decision as a \u201cdenial of justice\u201d and demand an explanation from the US ambassador. Counter-measures should be considered, including a review of US citizens claiming diplomatic immunity in the UK.</p> <p>More bullying, backed by self-defeating threats to curtail intelligence-sharing, characterises the US response to tentative suggestions by Johnson and other ministers that Britain may cut a deal with Huawei, the Chinese telecoms company blacklisted by the US. The advice from British security chiefs is that limited cooperation on building a 5G phone network would not pose a risk. Telecoms companies such as BT say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/17/uk-officials-frustrated-us-huawei-plan-b\" title=\"\">Huawei is the best, most competitive choice</a>.</p> <p>A Huawei deal would bring investment, jobs and better value for British consumers. The US has failed to come up with persuasive alternatives. Nonetheless, an almost hysterical US lobbying campaign continues apace. Trump was on the phone to Johnson again on Friday, urging him to reconsider. US officials warn that signing up Huawei would be \u201cnothing short of madness\u201d and could \u201cdiminish the appetite\u201d for a US-UK trade deal. Steven Mnuchin, US treasury secretary, will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/25/trump-speaks-with-boris-johnson-about-security-as-britain-nears-huawei-decision\" title=\"\">reinforce that message</a> in London this weekend.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump cannot be relied on to play straight or even sensibly. He fights dirty, and Britain can expect no favours from him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the US concerns are understandable, and supported by partners such as Australia, they are overstated. They stem partly from paranoia over China\u2019s rapid global rise and the two countries\u2019 technological and trade rivalries. Meanwhile, the crude linkage made between the Huawei decision and a post-Brexit US trade deal carries a salutary warning for Johnson. Chum or not, Trump cannot be relied on to play straight or even sensibly. He fights dirty, and Britain can expect no favours from him.</p> <p>Quite the contrary, in fact. Another US-UK row provided further evidence of a hostile, almost predatory pattern of US behaviour, apparently fuelled by perceptions of British weakness. This time the scrap was over long overdue plans for a 2% tax on digital giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. When the chancellor, Sajid Javid, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/22/uk-to-press-ahead-with-digital-tax-despite-us-pressure-javid-insists\" title=\"\">vowed to press ahead</a>, the US went off the deep end again, threatening punitive tariffs on British car exports.</p> <p>Talk of introducing an internationally agreed digital tax is all very well \u2013 but it could take years to implement, and looks like a delaying tactic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/03/amazon-accused-of-handing-over-diddly-squat-in-corporation-tax-despite-tripling-payment\" title=\"\">Amazon</a> and similar companies take large profits out of Britain. It is only right they should put more money back through fair and proportionate taxation. Ironically, Britain has the full backing of the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/23/eu-tech-regulator-backs-uk-plans-for-digital-tax-despite-trump-threats\" title=\"\">Margrethe Vestager</a>. France caved in last week amid more US threats. Johnson must stick to his guns.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s Trump problem did not emerge overnight. It has been building for three years. British people strongly back attempts to combat the climate emergency. In this crucial political battle, Trump is the principal foe. Sensible UK attempts to sustain the 2015 Iran nuclear deal have been met with threats of yet more US sanctions. Next up, expect a demand that Britain betray the Palestinians and support Trump\u2019s absurdly biased Middle East \u201cpeace plan\u201d, which is expected to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/24/donald-trump-set-to-unveil-middle-east-peace-plan-within-days\" title=\"\">unveiled within days</a>.</p> <p>The record of Trump\u2019s anti-British strong-arming, insults and condescension is long and galling. Such behaviour is unacceptable. Have US officials forgotten that Britain is a sovereign country? Is their arrogance and contempt, channelling the White House, so great that they simply do not care? Maybe Trump believes that the prime minister is a pushover whose post-Brexit neediness outstrips his sense of national self-respect.</p> <p>Perhaps he\u2019s right. We hope not. Britain\u2019s Trump problem is getting worse. Even Johnson\u2019s 80-seat majority will not save him if he fails to take a stand.</p>",

Pompeo is no diplomat. Like his boss, he has thuggish tendencies. In comparison, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is calm and polite. He was only recently in Washington, papering over cracks caused by the illegal US assassination of Iran\u2019s Qassem Suleimani. But even Raab was moved to condemn the Sacoolas decision as a \u201cdenial of justice\u201d and demand an explanation from the US ambassador. Counter-measures should be considered, including a review of US citizens claiming diplomatic immunity in the UK. More bullying, backed by self-defeating threats to curtail intelligence-sharing, characterises the US response to tentative suggestions by Johnson and other ministers that Britain may cut a deal with Huawei, the Chinese telecoms company blacklisted by the US. The advice from British security chiefs is that limited cooperation on building a 5G phone network would not pose a risk. Telecoms companies such as BT say Huawei is the best, most competitive choice. A Huawei deal would bring investment, jobs and better value for British consumers. The US has failed to come up with persuasive alternatives. Nonetheless, an almost hysterical US lobbying campaign continues apace. Trump was on the phone to Johnson again on Friday, urging him to reconsider. US officials warn that signing up Huawei would be \u201cnothing short of madness\u201d and could \u201cdiminish the appetite\u201d for a US-UK trade deal. Steven Mnuchin, US treasury secretary, will reinforce that message in London this weekend. While the US concerns are understandable, and supported by partners such as Australia, they are overstated. They stem partly from paranoia over China\u2019s rapid global rise and the two countries\u2019 technological and trade rivalries. Meanwhile, the crude linkage made between the Huawei decision and a post-Brexit US trade deal carries a salutary warning for Johnson. Chum or not, Trump cannot be relied on to play straight or even sensibly. He fights dirty, and Britain can expect no favours from him. Quite the contrary, in fact. Another US-UK row provided further evidence of a hostile, almost predatory pattern of US behaviour, apparently fuelled by perceptions of British weakness. This time the scrap was over long overdue plans for a 2% tax on digital giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. When the chancellor, Sajid Javid, vowed to press ahead, the US went off the deep end again, threatening punitive tariffs on British car exports. Talk of introducing an internationally agreed digital tax is all very well \u2013 but it could take years to implement, and looks like a delaying tactic. Amazon and similar companies take large profits out of Britain. It is only right they should put more money back through fair and proportionate taxation. Ironically, Britain has the full backing of the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager. France caved in last week amid more US threats. Johnson must stick to his guns. Britain\u2019s Trump problem did not emerge overnight. It has been building for three years. British people strongly back attempts to combat the climate emergency. In this crucial political battle, Trump is the principal foe. Sensible UK attempts to sustain the 2015 Iran nuclear deal have been met with threats of yet more US sanctions. Next up, expect a demand that Britain betray the Palestinians and support Trump\u2019s absurdly biased Middle East \u201cpeace plan\u201d, which is expected to be unveiled within days. The record of Trump\u2019s anti-British strong-arming, insults and condescension is long and galling. Such behaviour is unacceptable. Have US officials forgotten that Britain is a sovereign country? Is their arrogance and contempt, channelling the White House, so great that they simply do not care? Maybe Trump believes that the prime minister is a pushover whose post-Brexit neediness outstrips his sense of national self-respect. Perhaps he\u2019s right. We hope not. Britain\u2019s Trump problem is getting worse. Even Johnson\u2019s 80-seat majority will not save him if he fails to take a stand.",

This first disc collects English music by Purcell, Locke and Blow, and there\u2019s a startling moment when Locke\u2019s Saraband segues into the slow start of Haydn\u2019s Quartet Op 71 No 2. That\u2019s a fully mature string quartet, so expect future albums to fill in the gaps. The Purcell fantasias are strikingly expressive.

While Buxtehude\u2019s preludes and fugues are short-breathed in form, the two Chaconnes and one Passacaglia are logical and concentrated. Sonorous, imposing, but also highly agile, these remarkable pieces span the full gamut of the modern concert grand, with booming double octaves in the bass capturing the organ pedal parts, and bright-toned high flourishes in the treble. William Melton\u2019s outstanding booklet note tells us about Stradal as arranger and composer, pupil of Liszt and Bruckner, who clearly became a key figure in interpreting the music of the past for a newly curious 19th- and early 20th-century audience. \u2022 There\u2019s another highly original take on the past from the new Kitgut Quartet on their debut album, \u2019Tis too late to be wise (Harmonia Mundi). They\u2019re ingeniously exploring the links between early string ensemble pieces and the string quartet. This first disc collects English music by Purcell, Locke and Blow, and there\u2019s a startling moment when Locke\u2019s Saraband segues into the slow start of Haydn\u2019s Quartet Op 71 No 2. That\u2019s a fully mature string quartet, so expect future albums to fill in the gaps. The Purcell fantasias are strikingly expressive. I maybe would not have included Fairest Isle, which is nothing to do with a quartet, and would have ended with Purcell\u2019s superb G minor Chacony. \u2022 While BBC Radio 3 embarks on its mega Beethoven blitz for his 250th anniversary, the theme of modern takes on the past continues with pianist Kenneth Hamilton\u2019s touching contribution to The Essay (BBC Sounds). Hamilton explores Percy Grainger\u2019s elaborate version of Dowland\u2019s song Now, oh now I needs must part, making it a personal story of loss and death that reaches out from the radio. That is what broadcasting is all about.",

Sophisticated, thoughtful, frightening: if anything is America\u2019s sharper, adult answer to <em>Doctor Who,</em> it\u2019s this. The opener features a J-L P in retirement in his glorious French vineyard, magicked first light of dawn chasing off the last syllables of the night\u2019s wind; and just enough nods to 2434 or whatever to permit a hi-tech world, in rural France or whizzy rocket San Fran, of genial peace, harnessed technology, eco (-nomic and -logical) satisfaction. Yet there are still Romulans (miffed at having their planet blown up), smart semi-human droids (outlawed, since they blew up\u2026 er, Romulania?), and Data\u2019s twin daughters (!), the best of whom comes to an awful end, the mimsiest of whom the ageing J-L P just has to go looking for in the multiverse, abandoning (boo) his <em>terroir</em>. I hope I\u2019ve got at least some of this right; yet it is generally terrific, and far from the rocks wobbling we get some hugely new cutting-edge effects, and also former Borg drone Seven of Nine, from <em>Voyager</em>, rocket fuel to a thousand teenage fantasies, male and female. Crucially, it is kind and (eventually) optimistic. With much green blood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"111721761dd7505fd145153be75805c2c5543a5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/111721761dd7505fd145153be75805c2c5543a5d/0_0_3000_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hugh Laurie in Avenue 5, Armando Iannucci\u2019s new space spoof\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugh Laurie in Avenue 5, Armando Iannucci\u2019s new space spoof.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Home Box Office (HBO)/Sky</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I possibly shouldn\u2019t have watched it right after <strong><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/avenue-5\" title=\"\">Avenue 5</a></strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/30/armando-iannucci-david-copperfield-loop-death-of-stalin\" title=\"\">Armando Iannucci</a> has a history of doing this kind of thing \u2013 spoofing old genres, but doing it somehow better. <em>The Thick of It</em> beat <em>Yes Minister</em>.

But this series, sold as Ed getting to the heart of the rise of populism in Europe, achieved nothing of the sort. He empathised hugely with the \u201ctradition\u201d of Dutch fishermen, the way-we-were-ness (um\u2026 pulse fishing?

      "bodyText": "Star Trek: Picard (Amazon Prime) Avenue 5 (Sky One) Travels in Euroland With Ed Balls (BBC Two) | iPlayer Crazy Delicious (C4) | All 4 It\u2019s life, Jim, but not as we know it. It is now, apparently, \u201ca symbol for fractal neuronic coding. The theory was that Data\u2019s entire code, memories, could be reconstituted from a single positronic neuron.\u201d My, how Gene Roddenberry\u2019s little baby Star Trek is all growed up, as are we, from those first 60s wisps of hope-through-tech for humanity via the groping confusions of unintended consequences in a real-life techno-social world, on to this darker, cleverer, wilder beast. There has surely been in all its iterations, from Eugene\u2019s original to all the Voyagers and Discoveries and the lovely JJ Abrams\u2019s filmic reboots, a challenge for the makers of Star Trek: to stay true to the legions of diehard fans, the most outre elements of whom would possibly be more at home in a locked basement playing with soft cardboard goats (or spreading \u201camusing\u201d internet memes), and the potential hordes of next-gen folks who just want a damn fine story of staunch antiheroes and weird villains and perhaps a hardscrabble philosophical question or two to take to their beds and sleep on. Also, doing all that while not making the rocks wobble. Star Trek: Picard, the newest incarnation, in which Patrick Stewart returns a couple of remarkably unlined decades later as Jean-Luc Picard, the second most famous Federation cap\u2019n ever (there will only ever be one James T Kirk), is, I have to say, another glory. Sophisticated, thoughtful, frightening: if anything is America\u2019s sharper, adult answer to Doctor Who, it\u2019s this. The opener features a J-L P in retirement in his glorious French vineyard, magicked first light of dawn chasing off the last syllables of the night\u2019s wind; and just enough nods to 2434 or whatever to permit a hi-tech world, in rural France or whizzy rocket San Fran, of genial peace, harnessed technology, eco (-nomic and -logical) satisfaction. Yet there are still Romulans (miffed at having their planet blown up), smart semi-human droids (outlawed, since they blew up\u2026 er, Romulania?), and Data\u2019s twin daughters (!), the best of whom comes to an awful end, the mimsiest of whom the ageing J-L P just has to go looking for in the multiverse, abandoning (boo) his terroir. I hope I\u2019ve got at least some of this right; yet it is generally terrific, and far from the rocks wobbling we get some hugely new cutting-edge effects, and also former Borg drone Seven of Nine, from Voyager, rocket fuel to a thousand teenage fantasies, male and female. Crucially, it is kind and (eventually) optimistic. With much green blood. I possibly shouldn\u2019t have watched it right after Avenue 5. Armando Iannucci has a history of doing this kind of thing \u2013 spoofing old genres, but doing it somehow better. The Thick of It beat Yes Minister. And Avenue 5 beats both Mars Attacks! and Galaxy Quest in its sheer oof-per-minute wiggles and giggles. So Hugh Laurie is a rugged beardo cap\u2019n on a tourism starship, and it all goes wrong. With a tiny gravitational shift that sends fat tourists in a yoga class lurching and bumping, to the extent that an eight-week honeymoon tour around the stars turns into a three-year voyage to get home. We are left with tourists in space, for years, and a captain who was only brought in as an actor to feign beardy competence, and no functioning engineers. The corporate, as ever, is the enemy. \u201cI need to know who to blame \u2026 and if you\u2019re OK?\u201d It\u2019s star actor-heavy, yet lines such as \u201cThey\u2019ve over-ridden the Gorn Hegemony\u2026 sterilised it so it\u2019ll be qualitative, might even have saturated this place with antileptons \u2026 cheeky fuckers\u201d, delivered as soft asides, utterly win it for me.

It bills itself, excitingly, as a \u201ctrue crime podcast about climate change\u201d, though the show is not quite as racy as that sounds. Rather than smack her lips over ruined corpses, the pleasantly fry-toned presenter Amy Westervelt goes into detail about the history of what she calls \u201cbig oil\u201d (yes, she\u2019s American). Her tale is of how fossil fuels became our fuels of choice, even once we realised that they were causing immense damage to the environment. True crime, unless you\u2019re a Trumpian.</p> <p>Westervelt\u2019s approach is to research hard and then recount the story, and her show reminds me, a little bit, of Karina Longworth\u2019s longstanding history of Hollywood\u2019s golden years, <em><a href=\"http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/\" title=\"\">You Must Remember This</a></em>. It has that \u201cone woman expert\u201d feel, and the delivery is similar \u2013 not much emotion, few guests, the odd media clip, a few production tweaks. Like an extended essay, or an audio book.</p> <p>Such an approach has advantages \u2013 it\u2019s cheap, it gives everything weight \u2013 but it also means that the listener can drift off, especially when that listener (me) is a bit tired. I started <em>Drilled</em>\u2019s new series three times before I realised I had to be walking around rather than sitting in order for Westervelt\u2019s voice not to send me snooze-ward.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d97de459fb61c1e525d57cafc923b0944da6b346\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d97de459fb61c1e525d57cafc923b0944da6b346/41_83_3220_4025/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ivy Lee: the father of spin.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ivy Lee: the father of spin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new series, which looks at how fossil fuel companies use PR to make their products more palatable, is just two episodes in and I would recommend that you go straight to these: past episodes have suffered from shoddy production and repetition. In it, Westervelt looks at Ivy Lee, who became notorious in the 1910s as the PR guy who transformed business magnate John D Rockefeller from the US\u2019s most hated man into, seemingly, a kindly philanthropist. Shockingly, Lee was subsequently hired by the Third Reich, not necessarily to promote it, but to teach Hitler and Goebbels how to soften their language and butter up foreign journalists so their ideas seemed less appalling and more palatable. Ugh.</p> <p>Westervelt\u2019s argument is that Lee\u2019s PR approach forms the basis of how oil companies such as ExxonMobil, Shell and BP have been presenting their wares for several years. (Though of course, it\u2019s not just them: it\u2019s how most big commercial interests present themselves.) Techniques such as using green as a base colour for branding, calling the product not oil, but \u201cnatural gas\u201d, making sure you have good media relationships who will present your case rather than question it \u2026 All very interesting, and <em>Drilled</em> is definitely worth a listen, despite its occasionally frustrating approach.</p> <p>Over on <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csy6d0\" title=\"\">Discovery</a></strong>, on the World Service, which along with Radio 4 has been highlighting many aspects of the current climate emergency, science journo Gaia Vince interviewed scientists who suffer from \u201cecological grief\u201d. (She has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/12/how-scientists-are-coping-with-environmental-grief\" title=\"\">talked about this in the Observer</a>.) One, Steve Simpson, described how quickly and thoroughly his chosen topic of study \u2013 Australia\u2019s coral reefs \u2013 went from thriving to, well, less so. In just a few months, through water over-heating and acidification, 80% of the reef died. A coral graveyard. Other interviewees spoke of out-of-date emergency smoke protocols in Canada. When bushfires sent lung-clogging smoke into cities, people were told to stay indoors with the windows closed. But the smoke lasted, not for a couple of days, but for months. What effect does that have on you? How small do you want your life to be?</p> <p>Vince is a very traditional BBC presenter, and this programme is a very traditional World Service show: clear, workman-like, made so that audiences across the globe can understand it. No room for over-sentimentality. Still, Simpson, in the end, did have a tiny bit of good news. He played his old recordings of fish, made when the reef was still thriving, to tempt the surviving fish into areas where they could establish new habitats. Another interviewee, who works with indigenous people in Canada, talked about \u201caction feeling better than anxiety\u201d. Can they \u2013 can we \u2013 stem the crisis?</p> <h2>Three offbeat slices of satire</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/search?filter=programmes&amp;q=the+skewer\" title=\"\">The Skewer</a><br></strong>Jon Holmes, comedian and presenter, has a weirder side to him than you might think if you\u2019ve just caught him on radio (he\u2019s had various shows on the BBC, TalkRadio and Virgin). He started out with Chris Morris, and his new Radio 4 show is quite Morris-esque, featuring familiar people\u2019s voices cut up and repasted into almost real conversations. The prime minister gets a remix, blasting Get Brexit Down to a dance beat. Trump\u2019s backing is The Windmills of Your Mind\u2026 Nightmare, or dream? Funny and strange, like all good things.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-bugle-presents-the-last-post/%0D\" title=\"\">The Bugle Presents\u2026 The Last Post</a><br></strong><em>The Last Post</em> offers more traditional satire than <em>The Skewer</em>. Aussie comic Alice Fraser (with a co-host, usually another comic such as Tiff Stevenson or Andy Zaltzman) chats through the main events of the day, including anniversaries, death-a-versaries, current international news and silly ads. Fraser zips through contemporary topics with impressive zeal and a clever script, to much cheeriness and chipping in from her co-host. Each episode is only about 15 minutes long, but absolutely packed. Like a sweary, sped-up <em>News Quiz</em>.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/this-city/id1492707322\" title=\"\">This City</a><br></strong>This new podcast sees host Radio 1 presenter Clara Amfo talk to various famous people about their connection to London. OK, this isn\u2019t really satire, as you might have noticed. But\u2026! Amfo\u2019s first episode is an interview with the brilliant Mo The Comedian, aka Mo Gilligan, who can make anything and everything funny. Gilligan\u2019s skits on contemporary life are second to none, and if you want a skew-whiff, yet on point, dissection of who and what we are in the UK today, he\u2019s the one to turn to.</p>",

It has that \u201cone woman expert\u201d feel, and the delivery is similar \u2013 not much emotion, few guests, the odd media clip, a few production tweaks. Like an extended essay, or an audio book. Such an approach has advantages \u2013 it\u2019s cheap, it gives everything weight \u2013 but it also means that the listener can drift off, especially when that listener (me) is a bit tired. I started Drilled\u2019s new series three times before I realised I had to be walking around rather than sitting in order for Westervelt\u2019s voice not to send me snooze-ward. The new series, which looks at how fossil fuel companies use PR to make their products more palatable, is just two episodes in and I would recommend that you go straight to these: past episodes have suffered from shoddy production and repetition. In it, Westervelt looks at Ivy Lee, who became notorious in the 1910s as the PR guy who transformed business magnate John D Rockefeller from the US\u2019s most hated man into, seemingly, a kindly philanthropist. Shockingly, Lee was subsequently hired by the Third Reich, not necessarily to promote it, but to teach Hitler and Goebbels how to soften their language and butter up foreign journalists so their ideas seemed less appalling and more palatable. Ugh. Westervelt\u2019s argument is that Lee\u2019s PR approach forms the basis of how oil companies such as ExxonMobil, Shell and BP have been presenting their wares for several years. (Though of course, it\u2019s not just them: it\u2019s how most big commercial interests present themselves.) Techniques such as using green as a base colour for branding, calling the product not oil, but \u201cnatural gas\u201d, making sure you have good media relationships who will present your case rather than question it \u2026 All very interesting, and Drilled is definitely worth a listen, despite its occasionally frustrating approach. Over on Discovery, on the World Service, which along with Radio 4 has been highlighting many aspects of the current climate emergency, science journo Gaia Vince interviewed scientists who suffer from \u201cecological grief\u201d. (She has talked about this in the Observer.) One, Steve Simpson, described how quickly and thoroughly his chosen topic of study \u2013 Australia\u2019s coral reefs \u2013 went from thriving to, well, less so. In just a few months, through water over-heating and acidification, 80% of the reef died. A coral graveyard. Other interviewees spoke of out-of-date emergency smoke protocols in Canada. When bushfires sent lung-clogging smoke into cities, people were told to stay indoors with the windows closed. But the smoke lasted, not for a couple of days, but for months. What effect does that have on you? How small do you want your life to be? Vince is a very traditional BBC presenter, and this programme is a very traditional World Service show: clear, workman-like, made so that audiences across the globe can understand it. No room for over-sentimentality. Still, Simpson, in the end, did have a tiny bit of good news. He played his old recordings of fish, made when the reef was still thriving, to tempt the surviving fish into areas where they could establish new habitats. Another interviewee, who works with indigenous people in Canada, talked about \u201caction feeling better than anxiety\u201d. Can they \u2013 can we \u2013 stem the crisis? Three offbeat slices of satire The Skewer Jon Holmes, comedian and presenter, has a weirder side to him than you might think if you\u2019ve just caught him on radio (he\u2019s had various shows on the BBC, TalkRadio and Virgin). He started out with Chris Morris, and his new Radio 4 show is quite Morris-esque, featuring familiar people\u2019s voices cut up and repasted into almost real conversations. The prime minister gets a remix, blasting Get Brexit Down to a dance beat. Trump\u2019s backing is The Windmills of Your Mind\u2026 Nightmare, or dream? Funny and strange, like all good things. The Bugle Presents\u2026 The Last Post The Last Post offers more traditional satire than The Skewer. Aussie comic Alice Fraser (with a co-host, usually another comic such as Tiff Stevenson or Andy Zaltzman) chats through the main events of the day, including anniversaries, death-a-versaries, current international news and silly ads. Fraser zips through contemporary topics with impressive zeal and a clever script, to much cheeriness and chipping in from her co-host. Each episode is only about 15 minutes long, but absolutely packed. Like a sweary, sped-up News Quiz. This City This new podcast sees host Radio 1 presenter Clara Amfo talk to various famous people about their connection to London. OK, this isn\u2019t really satire, as you might have noticed. But\u2026! Amfo\u2019s first episode is an interview with the brilliant Mo The Comedian, aka Mo Gilligan, who can make anything and everything funny. Gilligan\u2019s skits on contemporary life are second to none, and if you want a skew-whiff, yet on point, dissection of who and what we are in the UK today, he\u2019s the one to turn to.",

Just as hundreds of millions of people should be reuniting with their families to celebrate the biggest holiday of the year, the lunar new year, swathes of the country have been put on lockdown and celebrations all but called off.</p> \n<p>As Xia and her parents tucked into a special winter rice and egg porridge on 27 December, even city authorities may not have known that the virus had started spreading around the city.</p> \n<p>It was not until three days later that they put out a <a href=\"https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6864153\" title=\"\">public warning</a> about a \u201cpneumonia of unknown cause\u201d which doctors had identified in Wuhan, and four days later that national authorities filed their first report about the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/\" title=\"\">with the World Health Organisation</a>.</p> \n<p>In early January, 36-year-old Xia started running a low fever.

Doctors told her to go home, rest and take over-the-counter medication.</p> \n<p>She followed their advice but her condition continued to worsen. Her fever intensified, she started having respiratory problems, and eating or drinking became painful.</p> \n<p>Her illness was developing in tandem with knowledge about the mysterious new outbreak. On 9 January, China announced it had identified a new coronavirus, from the same family that caused the 2002 Sars outbreak, in one of the Wuhan patients. Like all viruses in the corona family, it had originated in an animal; scientists were already racing to uncover the source.</p> \n<p>The next day, authorities announced the first death from the disease and <a href=\"http://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319\" title=\"\">released the genetic sequence</a> of the new virus online for study, winning plaudits for an approach that seemed very different from the official cover-up that exacerbated the Sars crisis.</p> \n<p>There were even hopes that Beijing might have managed to stop the outbreak before it had really begun. On 13 January, Chinese authorities said they had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/case-of-mystery-coronavirus-found-outside-china-for-the-first-time-thailand\" title=\"\">not identified any new cases for over a week</a>; and although a first case was reported outside the country in a traveller to China, she had first developed symptoms days earlier.</p> \n<p>If the disease came only from eating some kind of infected animal, and the market where it had originated was shut, there was perhaps a real possibility that no further cases would appear.</p> \n<p>But it has now emerged that even though China freely shared details of the cases it had identified in the early days of January, doctors on the ground in the city where the disease began were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/21/coronavirus-chinese-hospitals-not-testing-patients-say-relatives\" title=\"\">not testing widely</a> for the new virus as the month progressed.</p> \n<p>There is growing concern that a failure to carry out comprehensive testing during the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-timeline-from-wuhan-to-washington-state\" title=\"\"> early days of the outbreak</a> could have <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/3047606/coronavirus-response-highlights-flaws-way-chinas-bureaucracy\" title=\"\">helped the virus spread</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a77dcb662bbe5d211b9cae7f4f0b8fe46bd6f1a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a77dcb662bbe5d211b9cae7f4f0b8fe46bd6f1a/0_59_3569_2142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scanning the body heat of passengers at Rome airport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scanning the body heat of passengers at Rome airport.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/AEROPORTO DI ROMA/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Xia believes she is one of many victims who do not show up in statistics; she was finally admitted to hospital on the day after the genetic code was released.

It has since been identified as the source of the new coronavirus that has infected more than 1,400 people worldwide, killed more than 40 and plunged China into chaos. Just as hundreds of millions of people should be reuniting with their families to celebrate the biggest holiday of the year, the lunar new year, swathes of the country have been put on lockdown and celebrations all but called off. As Xia and her parents tucked into a special winter rice and egg porridge on 27 December, even city authorities may not have known that the virus had started spreading around the city. It was not until three days later that they put out a public warning about a \u201cpneumonia of unknown cause\u201d which doctors had identified in Wuhan, and four days later that national authorities filed their first report about the outbreak with the World Health Organisation. In early January, 36-year-old Xia started running a low fever. By then, authorities had closed the seafood market for disinfection, and identified 44 patients with the unknown pneumonia. But when she went to a local hospital on 4 January for a check-up, no one asked Xia about possible links to the market, or mentioned the mystery new illness. Doctors told her to go home, rest and take over-the-counter medication. She followed their advice but her condition continued to worsen. Her fever intensified, she started having respiratory problems, and eating or drinking became painful. Her illness was developing in tandem with knowledge about the mysterious new outbreak. On 9 January, China announced it had identified a new coronavirus, from the same family that caused the 2002 Sars outbreak, in one of the Wuhan patients. Like all viruses in the corona family, it had originated in an animal; scientists were already racing to uncover the source. The next day, authorities announced the first death from the disease and released the genetic sequence of the new virus online for study, winning plaudits for an approach that seemed very different from the official cover-up that exacerbated the Sars crisis. There were even hopes that Beijing might have managed to stop the outbreak before it had really begun. On 13 January, Chinese authorities said they had not identified any new cases for over a week; and although a first case was reported outside the country in a traveller to China, she had first developed symptoms days earlier. If the disease came only from eating some kind of infected animal, and the market where it had originated was shut, there was perhaps a real possibility that no further cases would appear. But it has now emerged that even though China freely shared details of the cases it had identified in the early days of January, doctors on the ground in the city where the disease began were not testing widely for the new virus as the month progressed. There is growing concern that a failure to carry out comprehensive testing during the early days of the outbreak could have helped the virus spread. Xia believes she is one of many victims who do not show up in statistics; she was finally admitted to hospital on the day after the genetic code was released. Despite her link to the market at the centre of the outbreak, and symptoms that matched those of confirmed victims, she was never tested. \u201cBefore there were any testing kits, which was before 16 January, I was regarded as a highly suspected case, meaning that I showed almost all of the symptoms,\u201d Xia told the Observer. But the hospital was already struggling with a sharp increase in patients showing symptoms that matched the reported coronavirus ones. Xia estimates that there were only two doctors on staff to check hundreds of people seeking help. Terribly overstretched, they focused only on the most serious cases and so on 20 January doctors discharged Xia into the care of her parents, without even formally noting her link to the South China seafood market on medical notes. That was the day China confirmed the disease could be spread between humans, rather than just picked up direct from an animal source. The number of patients had tripled, cases had appeared in other major cities, including the capital Beijing, and in a sign of official concern, the country\u2019s authoritarian president, Xi Jinping, made his first comments on the virus, saying it must be \u201cresolutely contained\u201d. Yet Xia was sent home, still sick, without having been tested. She is being cared for by her parents, but is terrified she might infect them; they try to protect themselves by staying five metres away from her at all times. Three days later, China stunned its citizens and the world by putting Wuhan under quarantine. From the morning of 23 January, no trains, planes or public transport would be allowed to leave the city; roadblocks later stopped most private cars from leaving either. Closing off a major industrial and commercial hub, home to 11 million people, was the bluntest possible admission that Beijing was now extremely worried about the new disease. Further decisive action included a pledge to build a new 1,000-bed hospital dedicated to the disease in under a week, and a second within two weeks. Work has already started on the first, and given China\u2019s track record of throwing up a similar hospital in Beijing during the Sars crisis, there is little doubt that the prefabricated facility will be finished in this extraordinary timescale. And in a sign that authorities had shifted from trying to downplay the disease, a very last-minute tribute to the doctors and nurses battling the disease was included in the new year television gala show, one of the most high-profile broadcasts of the year. By the time lunar new year\u2019s day dawned , the government had gone even further. More than 50 million people were in lockdown across the country, and nearly every province in China had declared a \u201clevel 1\u201d health emergency, the most serious kind, which allows quarantines and other serious measures.

He visited Wuhan expecting to find the city on a \u201cwar footing\u201d but instead was met with chaos and incompetence. \u201cI don\u2019t think the local government has done what it should do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even been handing out quarantine guides to people who were leaving.\u201d The coronavirus could hardly have emerged at a worse time for Chinese authorities, appearing in the weeks before the lunar new year, China\u2019s most important holiday. It is usually the occasion for the biggest human migration on the planet \u2013 up to 3 billion trips \u2013 as people race home to celebrate with family, travelling on packed trains, buses and planes. For the army of migrant workers from rural towns and villages who have powered decades of economic growth in China, it can be the only time in the year they get to return home and see their children and parents who have stayed behind. Even as the scale of the crisis became apparent, millions whose travel plans did not take them near Wuhan packed their bags and set off for the annual reunion, although many journeys were longer than usual. Evidence that patients may be able to carry the disease without any fever, cough or other common symptoms has added to concern. Tests have showed that a child in one family who did not appear unwell was in fact carrying the disease, the Lancet has reported. But widespread apprehension has changed the nature of the celebration. Normally a time for parties and celebration, banquets and fireworks, instead across the country \u2013 even in places far from the centre or any reported cases \u2013 people were cancelling their party plans and staying home. Streets, malls and restaurants were empty, attractions from the Great Wall to the Forbidden City and Shanghai\u2019s Disneyland had closed, and from Monday all group tourism \u2013 domestic and foreign \u2013 will be suspended. Instead, many people stayed at home, and took to the internet to find out more about the crisis. From the early days of the outbreak, warnings were appearing on China\u2019s vibrant but censored social media.

      "body": "<p>At a festival filled with smaller films jostling for attention, and quite often distribution, making headlines two weeks before Sundance has even kicked off is a boost that most film-makers would kill for. But for the directors of the documentary On the Record, gaining worldwide traction wasn\u2019t cause for celebration. It was something close to disaster.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/18/oprah-winfrey-russell-simmons-sexual-abuse-film\">Oprah Winfrey admits Russell Simmons pressured her over sexual abuse film</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The film, which details accusations of sexual misconduct and assault by music mogul Russell Simmons, initially seemed to have everything: a topical subject matter, the Oscar-nominated producer-director team of Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick, intimate access, a splashy outlet in the shape of Apple TV+ and, most importantly, an executive producer by the name of Oprah Winfrey. It was set to be the most widely accessible documentary on #MeToo in music at a time when the industry is slowly catching up to the reckoning that\u2019s taken place in the film world since the fall of Harvey Weinstein.</p> <p>Then on 10 January, things fell apart.</p> <p>In a shock move, Winfrey <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/01/oprah-winfrey-russell-simmons-kirby-dick-amy-ziering-documentary-appletv-sundance-1202827314/\">pulled her support and credit for the film</a>, taking its Apple distribution deal with her. At the time, she released a statement saying that there was \u201cmore work to be done on the film to illuminate the full scope of what the victims endured\u201d and that she didn\u2019t align herself with the \u201ccreative vision\u201d of Ziering and Dick. The film-makers have stood by the film, as has Sundance, and on Saturday, it premiered in the hope of finding a distributor in the process.</p> <p>It tells the story of A&amp;R executive Drew Dixon primarily but also of the other women who decided to come forward with their allegations of harassment and rape at the hands of Simmons, the co-founder of Def Jam, referred to in the film as \u201cthe godfather\u201d of hip-hop.</p> <p>Dixon is more than just a talking head, she\u2019s a fully fledged protagonist captured at every stage of a gruelling process from figuring out whether or not she wants to come forward, to dealing with journalists at the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/arts/music/russell-simmons-rape.html\">who would ultimately help tell her story</a>, to processing the aftereffects. It\u2019s a piercing portrait of what happens to someone when they go through not only the abuse itself but the complicated emotional journey in the years and decades after.</p> <p>\u201cI do not want to be radioactive,\u201d Dixon says in the film as she mulls over the potential fallout from coming forward.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"61da20c03c81a7159d4108d0b1e840dadda37516\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61da20c03c81a7159d4108d0b1e840dadda37516/0_0_1344_2020/665.jpg\" alt=\"Russell Simmons, referred to in On the Record as \u201cthe godfather\u201d of hip-hop, is accused of sexual misconduct and assault.\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russell Simmons, referred to in On the Record as \u2018the godfather\u2019 of hip-hop, is accused of sexual misconduct and assault.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dixon was a rare talent in the hip-hop scene of the mid-90s working her way up to her dream job at Def Jam through tenacity and drive but mostly, an undiluted love and an expertly trained ear for the music. In the film she talks about her early days of befriending the Notorious BIG (\u201cBiggie had my back\u201d) and helping to assemble Method Man and Mary J Blige\u2019s 1995 hit You\u2019re All I Need to Get By. She was a rising star in her early 20s working for a man who was \u201clike a god\u201d in the industry at the time. Simmons took her under his wing, a position that soon lost its luster when Simmons allegedly pulled her into a closet and tried to kiss her. She resisted his ongoing advances as politely as she knew she had to, given his position, but he increased his pursuit, allegedly exposing himself in her office soon after.</p> <p>Dixon refers to him as a \u201ctragic ADD puppy dog that I had to keep retraining\u201d, a depressingly inevitable part of the job for women in many industries and one that the doc frames as something reflected in the kind of music Dixon was working on. Hip-hop is described as \u201cmisogyny over dope beats\u201d but the film also makes sure to remind us that it\u2019s prevalent in all genres, using lyrics from Tom Jones and Mick Jagger among others to show a casual sexism that\u2019s existed throughout the history of music. (\u201cThat language set a tone,\u201d someone says.)</p> <p>It was in 1995 that life at Def Jam turned from degrading to wholly destructive. Dixon alleges that, after attending a party, Simmons offered to book her a car from his nearby apartment. It was the first time she was there with him alone and she suggested that waiting downstairs might be a wiser option. But he wanted her to listen to a demo. She offered to take the demo home and he asked her to remove it from a CD player in his bedroom. As she tried to figure out his hi-fi system, he emerged naked wearing a condom. \u201cHe just grabbed me and wrestled me to the bed,\u201d she recalls.</p> <p>She protested but was overpowered and remembers him telling her to \u201cstop fighting\u201d in a tone that was unfamiliar to her: \u201ccold, menacing, detached\u201d. Then she claims that he raped her.</p> <p>\u201cI was reduced to nothing in that moment,\u201d she says. \u201cI was trash \u2026 a physical device.\u201d</p> <p>Simmons allegedly thought this meant they now had a different relationship and told her they could now have sex regularly. In a meeting that week he asked her to sit on his lap. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m that person now,\u201d Dixon says of the moment.</p> <p>He has vehemently denied Dixon\u2019s claim as well as the many other claims that came out as well. \u201cThese horrific accusations have shocked me to my core and all of my relations have been consensual,\u201d he said in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/arts/music/russell-simmons-statement.html\">statement</a>. \u201cI will relentlessly fight against any untruthful character assassination that paints me as a man of violence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f75e21a55a25678587477cbe15e33cd106f9fcde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f75e21a55a25678587477cbe15e33cd106f9fcde/0_0_1100_619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drew Dixon shares her story in On the Record.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drew Dixon shares her story in On the Record.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sundance film festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the alleged incident, Dixon left Def Jam and found a job at Arista where she continued her professional success under Clive Davis, working on two Grammy-winning albums in a row from Lauryn Hill and Santana. But when Davis left, his replacement LA Reid allegedly brought back the sort of toxic environment she\u2019d hoped was left in her past. She claimed there was a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d environment where she was being sexualised and when she would turn down his overtures, he became \u201cmeaner and meaner\u201d.</p> <p>Dixon arranged an audition with a young, unsigned Kanye West who Reid referred to as \u201ca waste of my time\u201d while dressing her down in front of the office and with West within earshot. He then refused to attend a special performance she had set up with a similarly fresh-faced John Legend. She felt \u201cdoomed\u201d and \u201cdead in the water\u201d.</p> <p>Her music career ended before it had the chance to continue to flourish and she left the industry. \u201cWe all lose when brilliant women go away,\u201d a voice in the documentary states.</p> <p>In response, Reid\u2019s statement read: \u201cI\u2019m proud of my track record promoting, supporting and uplifting women at every company I\u2019ve ever run. That notwithstanding, if I have ever said anything capable of being misinterpreted, I apologize unreservedly.\u201d He left his job at Epic Records in 2017 after an accusation of sexual harassment.</p> <p>Dixon\u2019s isn\u2019t the only story shared in the documentary. Other women have come forward with stories of rape and sexual misconduct and we also hear their claims. \u201cHe just took, took, took what he wanted,\u201d says musician Sheri Sher who alleges that Simmons assaulted her.</p> <p>The documentary also adds important context not only with regards to the dangers faced by women in the music industry but the difficulty many women of colour face coming forward. There\u2019s a nuanced discussion related to the guilt many black women often feel when accusing black men of sexual assault and how this makes them feel like traitors, feeding into a system that has forever hypersexualised and punished them. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to let the culture down,\u201d says Dixon.</p> <p>It\u2019s a strong, emotive, substantive piece of work and one that largely relays testimonies that had already been vetted and legalled by the New York Times. So there remains a number of questions surrounding Winfrey\u2019s very public departure as well as anguish from the women involved and the community at large.

      "bodyText": "At a festival filled with smaller films jostling for attention, and quite often distribution, making headlines two weeks before Sundance has even kicked off is a boost that most film-makers would kill for. But for the directors of the documentary On the Record, gaining worldwide traction wasn\u2019t cause for celebration. It was something close to disaster. The film, which details accusations of sexual misconduct and assault by music mogul Russell Simmons, initially seemed to have everything: a topical subject matter, the Oscar-nominated producer-director team of Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick, intimate access, a splashy outlet in the shape of Apple TV+ and, most importantly, an executive producer by the name of Oprah Winfrey. It was set to be the most widely accessible documentary on #MeToo in music at a time when the industry is slowly catching up to the reckoning that\u2019s taken place in the film world since the fall of Harvey Weinstein. Then on 10 January, things fell apart. In a shock move, Winfrey pulled her support and credit for the film, taking its Apple distribution deal with her. At the time, she released a statement saying that there was \u201cmore work to be done on the film to illuminate the full scope of what the victims endured\u201d and that she didn\u2019t align herself with the \u201ccreative vision\u201d of Ziering and Dick. The film-makers have stood by the film, as has Sundance, and on Saturday, it premiered in the hope of finding a distributor in the process. It tells the story of A&amp;R executive Drew Dixon primarily but also of the other women who decided to come forward with their allegations of harassment and rape at the hands of Simmons, the co-founder of Def Jam, referred to in the film as \u201cthe godfather\u201d of hip-hop. Dixon is more than just a talking head, she\u2019s a fully fledged protagonist captured at every stage of a gruelling process from figuring out whether or not she wants to come forward, to dealing with journalists at the New York Times who would ultimately help tell her story, to processing the aftereffects. It\u2019s a piercing portrait of what happens to someone when they go through not only the abuse itself but the complicated emotional journey in the years and decades after. \u201cI do not want to be radioactive,\u201d Dixon says in the film as she mulls over the potential fallout from coming forward. Dixon was a rare talent in the hip-hop scene of the mid-90s working her way up to her dream job at Def Jam through tenacity and drive but mostly, an undiluted love and an expertly trained ear for the music. In the film she talks about her early days of befriending the Notorious BIG (\u201cBiggie had my back\u201d) and helping to assemble Method Man and Mary J Blige\u2019s 1995 hit You\u2019re All I Need to Get By. She was a rising star in her early 20s working for a man who was \u201clike a god\u201d in the industry at the time. Simmons took her under his wing, a position that soon lost its luster when Simmons allegedly pulled her into a closet and tried to kiss her. She resisted his ongoing advances as politely as she knew she had to, given his position, but he increased his pursuit, allegedly exposing himself in her office soon after. Dixon refers to him as a \u201ctragic ADD puppy dog that I had to keep retraining\u201d, a depressingly inevitable part of the job for women in many industries and one that the doc frames as something reflected in the kind of music Dixon was working on. Hip-hop is described as \u201cmisogyny over dope beats\u201d but the film also makes sure to remind us that it\u2019s prevalent in all genres, using lyrics from Tom Jones and Mick Jagger among others to show a casual sexism that\u2019s existed throughout the history of music. (\u201cThat language set a tone,\u201d someone says.) It was in 1995 that life at Def Jam turned from degrading to wholly destructive. Dixon alleges that, after attending a party, Simmons offered to book her a car from his nearby apartment. It was the first time she was there with him alone and she suggested that waiting downstairs might be a wiser option. But he wanted her to listen to a demo. She offered to take the demo home and he asked her to remove it from a CD player in his bedroom. As she tried to figure out his hi-fi system, he emerged naked wearing a condom. \u201cHe just grabbed me and wrestled me to the bed,\u201d she recalls. She protested but was overpowered and remembers him telling her to \u201cstop fighting\u201d in a tone that was unfamiliar to her: \u201ccold, menacing, detached\u201d. Then she claims that he raped her. \u201cI was reduced to nothing in that moment,\u201d she says. \u201cI was trash \u2026 a physical device.\u201d Simmons allegedly thought this meant they now had a different relationship and told her they could now have sex regularly. In a meeting that week he asked her to sit on his lap. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m that person now,\u201d Dixon says of the moment. He has vehemently denied Dixon\u2019s claim as well as the many other claims that came out as well. \u201cThese horrific accusations have shocked me to my core and all of my relations have been consensual,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI will relentlessly fight against any untruthful character assassination that paints me as a man of violence.\u201d After the alleged incident, Dixon left Def Jam and found a job at Arista where she continued her professional success under Clive Davis, working on two Grammy-winning albums in a row from Lauryn Hill and Santana. But when Davis left, his replacement LA Reid allegedly brought back the sort of toxic environment she\u2019d hoped was left in her past. She claimed there was a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d environment where she was being sexualised and when she would turn down his overtures, he became \u201cmeaner and meaner\u201d. Dixon arranged an audition with a young, unsigned Kanye West who Reid referred to as \u201ca waste of my time\u201d while dressing her down in front of the office and with West within earshot. He then refused to attend a special performance she had set up with a similarly fresh-faced John Legend. She felt \u201cdoomed\u201d and \u201cdead in the water\u201d. Her music career ended before it had the chance to continue to flourish and she left the industry. \u201cWe all lose when brilliant women go away,\u201d a voice in the documentary states. In response, Reid\u2019s statement read: \u201cI\u2019m proud of my track record promoting, supporting and uplifting women at every company I\u2019ve ever run. That notwithstanding, if I have ever said anything capable of being misinterpreted, I apologize unreservedly.\u201d He left his job at Epic Records in 2017 after an accusation of sexual harassment. Dixon\u2019s isn\u2019t the only story shared in the documentary. Other women have come forward with stories of rape and sexual misconduct and we also hear their claims. \u201cHe just took, took, took what he wanted,\u201d says musician Sheri Sher who alleges that Simmons assaulted her. The documentary also adds important context not only with regards to the dangers faced by women in the music industry but the difficulty many women of colour face coming forward. There\u2019s a nuanced discussion related to the guilt many black women often feel when accusing black men of sexual assault and how this makes them feel like traitors, feeding into a system that has forever hypersexualised and punished them. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to let the culture down,\u201d says Dixon. It\u2019s a strong, emotive, substantive piece of work and one that largely relays testimonies that had already been vetted and legalled by the New York Times. So there remains a number of questions surrounding Winfrey\u2019s very public departure as well as anguish from the women involved and the community at large. An open letter has been assembled by survivors of sexual misconduct and advocates, including Gloria Steinem, Marisa Tomei, Rosanna Arquette, Alyssa Milano and Thandie Newton, to show support. \u201cWe want them to know: We believe you. We hear you. You deserve to be seen,\u201d it reads. Winfrey has admitted that Simmons tried to pressure her into dropping the film but has denied that this affected her decision and earlier this week, she appeared on CBS to restate this. \u201cThis is not a victory for Russell,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not pull out because of Russell \u2026 I cannot be silenced by Russell Simmons after all I\u2019ve been through.\u201d Instead she claims that she told the film-makers there were inconsistencies and she wanted them to add a wider context to the story while also standing by the women featured. The New York Times reported that Winfrey apparently sent a copy of the film to director Ava DuVernay who replied with \u201charsh\u201d criticism. But as yet, there\u2019s been no real elaboration which leaves a worrying dark cloud over a film with an important message. \u201cIt was very disappointing and upsetting,\u201d said producer Ziering. \u201cWe were concerned about the survivors and what the hell this is going to do to them.\u201d According to a piece in the Hollywood Reporter this week, the survivors have been going through what Dixon refers to as a \u201chellscape\u201d with another accuser, the model turned domestic violence activist Sil Lai Abrams needing guidance from a trauma specialist. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m experiencing a second crime,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cI am being silenced. The broader community is being intimidated. The most powerful black woman in the world is being intimidated.\u201d As it premieres, On the Record hopes not only to find distribution but to course correct its journey and reiterate its intention to bring light to the stories of women who not only want to be heard, but want to be believed as well.",
