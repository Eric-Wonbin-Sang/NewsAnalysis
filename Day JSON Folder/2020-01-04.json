      "body": "<p>As a child in Japan in the 1950s and 60s, Nobuki Sugihara never knew his father had saved thousands of lives. Few did. His father, Chiune Sugihara, was a trader who lived in a small coastal town about 34 miles south of Tokyo. When not on business trips to Moscow, he coached his young son in mathematics and English. He made breakfast, spreading butter on the toast so thinly \u201cnobody could compete\u201d.</p> <p>His son had no idea his father saved 6,000 Jews during the second world war. Over six weeks in the summer of 1940, while serving as a diplomat in Lithuania, Chiune Sugihara defied orders from his bosses in Tokyo, and issued several thousand visas for Jewish refugees to travel to Japan.</p> <p>Even when an Israeli diplomat contacted the family in 1969, the young Sugihara did not realise the scale of what his father had done. \u201cWe never thought so many survivors survived, because my father never talked like [it was] a heroic act. We were not excited,\u201d Nobuki Sugihara told the <em>Observer</em> in his home in Antwerp.</p> <p>Now the life and legacy of his father will be celebrated in Lithuania, 80 years after he issued \u201cvisas for life\u201d to refugees who sought his help. Lithuania\u2019s government has declared 2020 \u201c<a href=\"https://lrv.lt/en/news/the-deeds-of-chiune-sugihara-to-be-commemorated-in-2020\" title=\"\">the year of Chiune Sugihara</a>\u201d: an official programme promises an exhibition of photographs in Lithuania\u2019s parliament, as well as concerts, conferences, films, postage stamps and a monument erected in Kaunas, Lithuania\u2019s former capital, where Sugihara was posted in 1939. It is all part of the burgeoning memorialisation of Sugihara, who in 1984, two years before he died, was declared \u201crighteous among the nations\u201d by <a href=\"https://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/stories/sugihara.html\" title=\"\">Yad Vashem</a>, the Israeli state organisation that commemorates the Holocaust.</p> <p>Chiune Sugihara was sent to Kaunas in the autumn of 1939 to open a consulate, soon after Nazi tanks had rolled into neighbouring Poland. At first glance, it was a curious posting for the up and coming diplomat who, by leaving blank an entrance exam paper for medical school, had defied his father\u2019s wish for him to become a doctor. There were no Japanese people registered as living in the country, thousands of miles from the Pacific. But Kaunas was an ideal place for Japan to check up on its ally, Nazi Germany, whom it suspected of making a secret pact with Joseph Stalin, as well as plotting an invasion of the Soviet Union. Both suspicions were confirmed by Sugihara\u2019s contacts with Polish spies, and reconnaissance of Nazi troop movements, sometimes done under the guise of a picnic.</p> <p>Lithuania would suffer a double occupation by Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. But for nearly 10 months at the start of the second world war, Kaunas was the free capital of independent Lithuania, \u201ca Casablanca of the north\u201d, a hotbed of spies, as well as a short-lived haven for refugees fleeing Soviet and Nazi occupiers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f6ae6d6b35eb2e036d504b23e9c9c8394a74d79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f6ae6d6b35eb2e036d504b23e9c9c8394a74d79/296_411_2682_1609/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jewish refugees queuing for transit visas at the Japanese consulate in Kaunas, July 1940.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jewish refugees queuing for transit visas at the Japanese consulate in Kaunas, July 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nobuki Sugihara</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sent to Lithuania to gather intelligence, Sugihara had probably not bargained for the scores of refugees who arrived at his gates in 1940. After the Soviet Union invaded Lithuania on 15 June, refugees flocked to the modest two-storey Japanese consulate that was also home to Sugihara, his wife Yukiko, their two toddlers and a newborn. Many were Polish Jews, who had arrived only months earlier after the Soviet invasion of Poland. Now they were looking for a second escape.</p> <p>Sugihara sought instructions from his foreign ministry in Tokyo. He was told not to issue visas to anyone without proper papers, ruling out almost everyone in the queue. Making another request to Tokyo, he was told not to ask again. He decided to issue visas anyway. Over six weeks in July and August, he worked 18-hour days, eventually writing out by hand 2,139 transit visas \u2013 a record only discovered years later in the archives of Japan\u2019s foreign ministry.</p> <p>\u201cHe started in the beginning [with] 10 or 20 people,\u201d recounts his son, Nobuki, a retired diamond dealer, now aged 70. \u201cIt suddenly became 100. I don\u2019t think he imagined that 2,000 people would reach him but he could not stop. If they asked with such a face you can\u2019t refuse.\u201d His father, who died in 1986, never explained in detail why he acted in this way: \u201cI asked my father and he said, \u2018I just pitied them.\u2019 Just one word. No great reason.\u201d</p> <p>Sugihara\u2019s story is \u201ca kind of bright light\u201d for Lithuania, says Simonas Strelcovas, a historian who has written a book about the Japanese diplomat and the refugees who fled to Lithuania. He found the overlooked fact that many of the Polish Jews were fleeing Soviet repression rather than the Holocaust, which had not yet begun.</p> <p>He highlights that these refugees survived because of Sugihara\u2019s actions, combined with the Lithuanian government\u2019s openness to refugees until the Soviet invasion in June 1940. It is a record that contrasts with the later participation of some Lithuanians in the murder of Jews, documented by the Yale historian, Timothy Snyder. \u201cThose refugees lived without any problem from autumn 1939 to the summer of 1940 because of the Lithuanian state,\u201d Strelcovas said. \u201cWe need as much Sugihara\u2019s story as Japan needs Sugihara today.\u201d</p> <p>Sugihara\u2019s lifesaving visas were just one part of the paper trail. A Dutch businessman-turned-diplomat, Jan Zwartendijk, issued many Polish refugees with final destination visas to the Dutch colony of Cura\u00e7ao in the Caribbean. Another forgotten player was Stalin.</p> <p>Sugihara, who spoke fluent Russian, had to bargain with Moscow to ensure the Jewish refugees had safe passage through the Soviet Union, as well as the right to leave Vladivostok for Japan. The promise of hard currency earned from the sale of refugees\u2019 travel documents helped the Politburo reach its decision in July 1940. Stalin signed the order approving transit for refugees, which the Soviet document said included Jewish religious (<em>yeshiva</em>) teachers and students, salesmen, lawyers and other liberal professions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I asked my father [why he saved them].

In a sign of irritation that the UK had not already expressed its support for the US, Pompeo on Friday said the Europeans, including \u201cthe Brits\u201d, \u201c[had]n\u2019t been as helpful as I wish that they could be\u201d.</p> \n<p>On Saturday night the defence minister, Ben Wallace, announced that the warships HMS Montrose and HMS Defender would return to escort duties for ships sailing under a British merchant flag through the Strait of Hormuz. \u201cThe government will take all necessary steps to protect our ships and citizens at this time,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Johnson is expected to update MPs on the crisis when parliament returns after the Christmas and New Year break on Tuesday. But as the hashtag #wheresBoris began trending on Twitter, opposition politicians tore into Johnson, suggesting he was too afraid of upsetting President Donald Trump, who ordered the assassination of Suleimani, to speak out.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson was facing growing criticism on Saturday night for failing to cut short his Caribbean holiday as the Middle East faced one of the gravest crises since the Iraq war in 2003. As global leaders weighed in on the assassination of Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani, in a US drone strike in Baghdad in the early hours of Friday, Johnson remained silent on the island of Mustique where he is on holiday with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds. Downing Street said Johnson would be back in the UK on Sunday and that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, would travel to Washington this week for talks with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, with the Middle East the main topic of discussion. In a sign of irritation that the UK had not already expressed its support for the US, Pompeo on Friday said the Europeans, including \u201cthe Brits\u201d, \u201c[had]n\u2019t been as helpful as I wish that they could be\u201d. On Saturday night the defence minister, Ben Wallace, announced that the warships HMS Montrose and HMS Defender would return to escort duties for ships sailing under a British merchant flag through the Strait of Hormuz. \u201cThe government will take all necessary steps to protect our ships and citizens at this time,\u201d he said. Johnson is expected to update MPs on the crisis when parliament returns after the Christmas and New Year break on Tuesday. But as the hashtag #wheresBoris began trending on Twitter, opposition politicians tore into Johnson, suggesting he was too afraid of upsetting President Donald Trump, who ordered the assassination of Suleimani, to speak out. Tory sources said his silence was more likely to be part of a co-ordinated effort by EU leaders to say little in order not to inflame the situation. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said it was \u201castonishing\u201d that Johnson had still to make a statement on the crisis in Iran, which was \u201con the brink of becoming an even more destructive and catastrophic war than Iraq or Syria\u201d. Writing in the Observer, she says: \u201cIs he afraid of angering President Trump? Or is it simply that, as he lounges in the Caribbean sun, he simply does not care, an exact mirror of the blase approach on Iran he took in his past role as foreign secretary when Trump was driving the nuclear deal to destruction in 2018, and when recklessly jeopardising the fate of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe the previous year.\u201d Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 acting leader, said Johnson\u2019s silence was \u201cdeafening\u201d. \u201cThe prime minister must speak out now and make clear Britain will not support the United States in repeating the mistakes of the Iraq war,\u201d he said. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, said he found Johnson\u2019s silence \u201cquite extraordinary\u201d adding: \u201cThere is a clear responsibility on him as prime minister of the United Kingdom to speak up in what is a very, very dangerous situation. All of us have got to call for calmness.\u201d Asked if he believed Johnson might be worried about upsetting his friend Trump, Blackford reiterated: \u201cHe is the prime minister of the United Kingdom and he should speak without fear or favour at such a time.\u201d A former Tory minister with experience of the EU and the Middle East said he believed Johnson\u2019s decision not to speak out was part of a deliberate strategy, co-ordinated with other EU leaders. \u201cWe are still members of the EU [until 31 January] and I think it is right.

To reach the final stage, they must first win the backing of 10% of the 212-strong cohort of Labour MPs and MEPs. And second, they have to be nominated either by at least 5% of the 647 constituency Labour parties (CLPs) or at least three organisations affiliated to the Labour party (two or more of which must be trade unions affiliated to the party).</p> <p><strong>Once the successful candidates have got on to the ballot paper, what happens?</strong><br>Before 2014, the eventual leader was chosen by an \u201celectoral college\u201d in which MPs, the unions and other affiliated organisations, and members had a third of the vote each. The system was abolished by former Labour leader Ed Miliband and it is now a one-member-one-vote arrangement. Candidates will hold numerous hustings before forms go out and voting begins.</p> <p><strong>Who exactly can vote?</strong><br>There are three categories. The first is full members of the Labour party (around 500,000). The second is affiliated supporters who are members of unions or socialist societies who opt-in to the process.

After his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/01/west-bromwich-albion-leeds-united-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">Leeds had drawn 1-1 at West Brom</a>, there was a hug for Slaven Bilic which went on, and on. The camera cut away, showed some players walking off the pitch, lingered on the crowd, then went back. They were still in each other\u2019s arms, gazing at one another in mutual admiration. They\u2019ll always have the Hawthorns.</p> <p>The league, Bilic said, is lucky to have Bielsa. Leeds must feel incredibly blessed. It is not just that they top the Championship, that they stand nine points clear of Brentford in third and that they go to the Emirates in the FA Cup on Monday with a genuine sense of expectation.</p> <p>It is that they have in Bielsa a manager who, in a sporting world in which values have become hopelessly corrupted, seems to grasp both how essentially trivial football is and yet how it can ignite a region. It is a sign of his remarkable influence that in Mikel Arteta, Bielsa will be in the highly unusual position of facing a second-generation prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a manager whose profoundest influence was Pep Guardiola, who is open in acknowledging his debt to Bielsa.</p> <p>Bielsa probably should have won more in his career. Three league championships won under Argentina\u2019s two-titles-a-year system and the 2004 Olympic gold is a meagre haul for somebody Bilic discusses in such revered tones. That is a failing but Bielsa\u2019s entire career feels a rebuke to the idea a life can be measured out in trophies or medals.</p> <p>He is an obsessive. He comes from a wealthy family \u2013 his grandfather was a judge, his brother was Argentina\u2019s foreign minister and his sister a provincial governor \u2013 and earns a reported \u00a36m a year. Yet he seems to have little interest in the trappings of wealth. He lives in a one-bedroom flat above a shop in Wetherby, drinks coffee and holds team meetings in the Costa, shops in Morrisons and eats regularly at a local Italian restaurant called Sant Angelo. He walks the 45 minutes to training at Thorp Arch most days and rarely seems to wear anything other than his Leeds tracksuit.</p> <p>But he is aware of his obsession, knows just how ridiculous it is. At the beginning of the 1992 <em>Clausura</em>, after a dismal 1991 <em>Apertura</em> in which his Newell\u2019s Old Boys side won only three of their 19 games, he locked himself in a room at the Conquistador hotel before an away game in Santa F\u00e9 and undertook what was essentially a 48-hour audit of how he believed the game should be played.</p> <p>During it he rang his wife, Laura. Their daughter had recently survived critical illness. In that context, he acknowledged, it made no sense to feel as bad as he did about losing football matches \u2013 and yet he did. That thoroughness of self-assessment is characteristic of Bielsa.

Not a great day at the office for Wolves\u2019 captain and defensive linchpin Harry Allen, though fortunes can change quickly in football, and he ended the season by scoring the winner against Everton in the FA Cup final. Not sure what relevance this has, but having found it out, it seemed silly not to at least mention it.</p> <p><strong>Wolves have won three more FA Cups since then. </strong>They saw off Newcastle United in the 1908 final, beat Leicester City 3-1 in 1949 (having beaten Matt Busby\u2019s holders in the semi) and trounced ten-man Blackburn Rovers in 1960, whereupon they were pelted with rubbish by the crowd, the match having been that boring.<br></p> <p><strong>Manchester United have meanwhile gone on to win this grand old competition 12 times.</strong> Let\u2019s not list them, we\u2019ll be here all day. Their last victory came in 2016, when popularity\u2019s Jesse Lingard snatched a late extra-time winner against Crystal Palace. The way things have been going for the poor bugger lately, he\u2019d do well to get back on the scoring trail today.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a tough ask for United, mind.</strong> They\u2019re an inconsistent rabble, capable at times of jaw-dropping brilliance (away at Manchester City) but also mind-numbing ineptitude (at Arsenal the other day). They lost here at Molineux in this competition last year. And Wolves are in a much happier place on the achievement/expectation spectrum right now, despite losing their last two Premier League games.</p> <p><strong>Wolves threw away the chance of making their first final since 1960 last season. </strong>They\u2019d love to go at least one better this time round. But United will be desperate for a fillip, and a big FA Cup win, followed by a good showing in the first leg of the League Cup semi against neighbours City on Tuesday, could abruptly alter the mood music in the red half of Manchester and turn a difficult season into a much more promising affair. Plenty riding on this, then. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>5.31pm GMT. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/g6Nt3FYEf5k\">Heads up.</a></p> </div>   </div>",

Thin gruel for Paul Doyle, who was our man at Molineux. Here\u2019s his report. Click, enjoy ... and thanks for reading this MBM! Ole talks! \u201cIt is always a grind when you come to Molineux. Good team, strong team, physical. I thought we dominated the first half but they took over in the second. It was an even game, and a draw was a fair result. We didn\u2019t create too many chances in the first but we controlled it. In the second half we had two decent chances. I thought Chong was fantastic, I am very pleased with him. We were close to taking Maguire off but he battled through. I\u2019d rather have a replay and still be in the FA Cup.\u201d Nuno speaks. \u201cIt was tough. We had quality in some moments. It\u2019s not easy to play football. But we played better in the second half. There were not very many spaces. We controlled better in the second half. We wanted to solve the situation today, because we have a very tight schedule. But we want to play. We have a week to recover well.\u201d Just like last year, Paul Doyle was at Molineux as Wolves and United went at each other in the cup. Here\u2019s his report. Victor Lindelof was given the man of the match award. \u201cIt was a tough game,\u201d he tells BT Sport. \u201cThere has been a lot of games during this period, and we changed a few players. But the young players showed great character. In the first half we controlled the game. Obviously we want to score goals, but they were a tough opponent.\u201d Back to Old Trafford we go! For a replay that neither team will have wanted, with a crowded 2020 coming up. But they\u2019re both still in the FA Cup, so there is that. 90 min +6: Unreserved apologies for the fate-tempting entry on 9 min. 90 min +5: Dalot has another go, this time from the best part of 30 yards. He hits Greenwood and the ball deflects harmlessly out for a goal kick. 90 min +4: Moutinho is booked for a wrestling move on Fred. The free kick\u2019s hooked into the box, causing Wolves mild panic. The ball drops to Dalot, in space to the right of the six-yard box. He spins and welts a shot deep into the crowd. What a waste. 90 min +3: Greenwood is in space in the middle, with plenty of turf in front of him. But Pereira\u2019s long ball forward is no good. 90 min +2: Traore glides down the right and crosses hard and low. Lindelof does very well to hook clear with Jimenez lurking. 90 min +1: Jonny rolls the ball towards Neto out on the left. Neto lets the ball roll under his boot. Throw. Young takes an age, and earns a lecture from the ref. He\u2019s already on a booking, so is really testing the official\u2019s patience. 90 min: All very hectic as time marches on. Everyone desperate to avoid last-gasp heartbreak. But there will be six added minutes. So plenty of time for drama yet. 88 min: Neto wastes a good opportunity out on the left by blootering the ball out for a goal kick. He had options in the middle. 87 min: Maguire goes on an upfield sortie. He loses the ball and is out of position as Neto threatens to latch onto a long pass up the other end. Young does extremely well to get his body in the way and win a cheap free kick. Danger over. 86 min: Young is booked for a cynical tug on the back of Neto. The clock ticks on. Can anyone find the killer punch? 85 min: United are so close to taking Wolves back to Old Trafford. Romero goes through the motions over a goal kick. Carefully, slowly. Perfect game management, and Wolves are accordingly irritated. They have to suck it up. 83 min: Rashford and Pereira combine at speed down the inside-left channel. Just as it looks as though Rashford is going to burst clear in the box, Neves slides in and gets a toe to the ball. Rashford goes over and demands a penalty with some feeling, but he\u2019s not getting one. 82 min: Chong can\u2019t continue. Dalot comes on in his stead. Moutinho has a belt from 25 yards out on the left. It sails harmlessly wide right. 81 min: Jimenez jigs his way down the right and enters the box. He smashes a shot from a ridiculous angle, as tight as it comes, slicing the ball onto the near post, Romero beaten all ends up. That battered the woodwork, it\u2019s a wonder the frame is still standing. 80 min: From a standing start, Traore whizzes past Williams down the right in the Olympic style. His cross nearly confuses Romero at the near post, but the ball flies away from danger. Wolves have turned it up a notch or two. 78 min: No complaints from Wolves, although the crowd are giving it the big one about VAR. Then Jonny sends a shot whistling past the left-hand post from the left-hand corner of the D. He\u2019s made an instant impression on this match. 77 min: Jimenez whirls down the left, reaches the byline, and executes a pointless rabona, with nobody in the middle to convert. Wolves come again, Jonny crossing from the same flank, Doherty heading into the top right. But he doesn\u2019t celebrate, knowing full well the ball had come off his arm before flying in. He\u2019ll be sick that he\u2019s miscued that header; it was a great chance to score. 75 min: The free kick is a non-event. Jonny replaces Vinagre. And Chong is determined to keep going. He\u2019s back on. 74 min: Chong looks in some pain. He\u2019s blowing hard as he receives treatment. He eventually gets up and walks off the pitch. Can he continue? A rueful shake of the head suggests maybe not. 73 min: Chong knocks the ball down the right touchline. He\u2019s away, but Kilman slides in late. Kilman tries to pull out of the challenge, but he\u2019s zipping across the turf at speed, and catches poor Chong on the shin. That\u2019s one of the clearest bookings you\u2019ll see. 72 min: Wolves respond to the double change by sending Joao Moutinho on for Saiss. 70 min: Within 27 seconds of coming on, Rashford hits the crossbar! Greenwood slips him clear with a clever slide-rule pass down the inside-left channel. He shoots. The ball loops off the sliding Coady\u2019s boot, sailing over the stranded Ruddy. It\u2019s heading towards the top right ... but doesn\u2019t quite drop. It pings off the woodwork, and away from danger. What an introduction that would have been! 69 min: United make two changes. Mata and James make way for Fred and Marcus Rashford. 67 min: Greenwood has been quiet, but springs to life as he sashays in from the right and looks for the top right from 30 yards. It\u2019s overly ambitious, and clears the bar by many miles. Still, if you don\u2019t buy a ticket, etc. 66 min: Vinagre brings down Young, out near the right-hand corner flag. A free kick that Mata takes. It\u2019s hoicked towards Maguire, who doesn\u2019t get any significant purchase on his header from six yards. The ball sails wide left to Matic, who trundles it out of play to relieve the pressure on the hosts. 64 min: Traore runs around on the right in a rococo style. He eventually carves out space to cross; his effort is eyebrowed to the far post by Maguire, giving Vinagre the opportunity to lash wildly into the crowd from a tight angle. A half-chance, that. 62 min: Chong suddenly turns on the jets and makes good down the right. His low cross looks dangerous; with black shirts lurking, Coady does extremely well to spin and slap the ball clear. 60 min: Farcical scenes in the United defence as Maguire plays a pass across the face of his own goal, and Romero slices it out for a corner as he tries to send it back to the defender. The resulting set piece is a non-event, but United betrayed their continuing uncertainty at the back there. 58 min: It was dangerous all right! Ruddy goes to his left, assuming Mata was going to whip the free kick over the wall towards the top right. Instead, Mata goes left, and his effort flies millimetres wide of the top-left corner, Ruddy utterly deceived, out of the game completely. That would have been a very cheeky one. United so close to taking the lead. 57 min: Saiss goes in the book for a preposterous sliding challenge on Chong, who was making good down the right. Vinagre was still on point; it was a needless challenge. And now this is a free kick just to the right of the D. Ruddy waves his arms around in the wall-arranging, agitated fashion. This is a dangerous one. 56 min: Neves departs, but after a final check, he\u2019s back on quickly enough. The second half begins again. 55 min: That\u2019s a proper sore one for Neves, who is flat on his back, the physios going the extra mile to make sure he\u2019s not concussed. Meanwhile on the United bench, Phil Jones performs a few stretches, maybe with a view to replacing Harry Maguire. Time will tell. 53 min: Neves is down having been clumped upside the head, Lindelof accidentally nutting him from behind. A pause as he gets some treatment. 51 min: Lindelof fires a long pass down the middle that very nearly releases James. Wolves go up the other end and test Romero\u2019s fitness, Neto striding into space down the inside-left channel and battering a low shot straight at the keeper. Romero parries well. He passes the test. 50 min: Another injury worry for United, as Romero goes down clutching his left leg. A hamstring injury? Perhaps not, as the physio gives the bench the internationally recognised signal for Don\u2019t Panic. Cramp as opposed to a hamstring issue, maybe ... but he is clutching the back of his leg and grimacing quite a lot. He continues, anyway. 48 min: Traore and Doherty combine well down the right again. Doherty is the one zipping towards the byline this time; his cross towards the near post is dealt with by Lindelof. The hosts appear to have taken it up a notch, their hairstyles perhaps nicely blow-dried during the break. 47 min: Traore chips the ball down the right wing for Doherty, who wins the first corner of the half. They play it short. Traore turns on the boosters and reaches the byline on the right. He whips a low ball towards Jimenez, but Chong is on hand to hack clear just in time. Here we go again, then. Wolves kick off the second half. Raul Jimenez has taken the place of young Ashley-Seal, who was feeding on scraps in that first half to be fair. Harry Maguire hasn\u2019t been replaced, though, so hopefully that hip isn\u2019t giving him too much gyp. Half-time entertainment. Details here of the biggest cup shock of the day. The FA Cup knocked into a cocked hat. Just the 16 seconds of added time, and that\u2019s your lot for the first half. Time to reboot a game that had a nice fresh feel for 20 minutes or so, before going on the turn. Managers, please, do your thing. 44 min: United come back yet again, and James is barged from behind by Doherty. It should be a free kick, just to the left of the Wolves box, but the ref isn\u2019t interested. Wolves could do with hearing the half-time whistle; they\u2019ve done very little up front since the 18-minute mark, United having dominated possession since then. 43 min: Young wins a corner off Vinagre down the right. Mata takes. Ruddy punches powerfully clear. But United come again, Pereira forcing Kilman into conceding another corner. Traore clears this one. 41 min: Maguire went over awkwardly in a challenge with Traore a few minutes ago. He\u2019s now limping a little as a result, having apparently hurt his hip in the fall. Plenty of frowning going on, both on the field of play and in the United dugout. A decision to be made at half-time, perhaps, with the League Cup semi against Manchester City coming up on Tuesday. 39 min: Lindeof bustles his way down the left and earns a corner. He meets the set piece himself, but sends a directionless header deep into the stand behind the goal. 37 min: James dances into the Wolves box down the right and tries to thread one into the bottom left. He drags it across Ruddy and out for a goal kick. The Wolves keeper still hasn\u2019t had much to do, though United have enjoyed the bulk of possession. 36 min: Chong feeds Young down the right. Young whips it in low. Doherty is hip to what\u2019s going on and belts clear. 34 min: Traore wins a corner down the right. From the restart, Neves has a dig from 30 yards. Nope. 32 min: A VAR check for a penalty, after Dendoncker miscontrols in his own box and Williams falls over as he tries to skip off with the ball. There\u2019s not a great deal of contact; certainly nothing clear and obvious enough to overrule the initial decision to wave play on. Though you\u2019ve seen them given; one of those. The fans break into a chorus of the English folk standard Fuck VAR. Altogether now... 30 min: Doherty launches long down the middle. Traore turns Maguire with ease. Maguire falls to the floor, demanding a free kick he\u2019s never going to get. Fortunately for United, Lindelof is on hand to get to the ball before Traore, and clears. 29 min: Chong probes down the right and cuts back for James on the edge of the D. James leans back and sends a shot sailing miles over the crossbar. 27 min: Neto bustles his way through a couple of half-arsed United challenges and reaches the byline on the left. He whips a wonderful cross through the United area, but none of his old-gold pals have kept up with play, and it\u2019s an easy mop-up job for Williams. 26 min: United are beginning to dominate possession, and they\u2019re spending increasing time in the Wolves half. Pereira has a whack from 25 yards; it\u2019s high, wide and not so handsome. But United will be happy with the last ten minutes or so. 25 min: Pereira sends James skittering down the left at great speed. James whizzes into the box and rolls a cross through the six-yard box. But there\u2019s nobody in a black shirt waiting to poke home. Coady is able to hook clear without too much fuss. 24 min: Greenwood tries to spark the game back into life with an ambitious shot from distance out on the left. It\u2019s deflected, spinning high into the air, an easy gather for Ruddy under no pressure whatsoever. 22 min: More scrappiness. The 18 min entry really has done a number on this match. 20 min: So having said that, it suddenly goes scrappy for the first time. Pulitzer, please! 18 min: Vinagre gets on the end of a long ball down the inside left channel. He guides a weak shot straight at Romero from a tight angle. Then United go up the other end through Chong, who skips into the box from the right and very nearly works space to shoot. But one touch too many allows Kilman to nick the ball away and go over for a cheap free kick. This match is good end-to-end fun. 16 min: Saiss blasts a witless free kick straight into the United wall. United half clear. Wolves come back at them again, Vinagre attempting to flick the ball past Lindelof down the left. Wolves claim a hand ball, and a penalty, but neither ref nor VAR is interested, and it was outside the area anyway. 15 min: Traore burns his way down the inside-right channel. He\u2019s got Maguire and Lindelof back-pedalling furiously. Maguire sticks out a leg to block. Saiss picks up the loose ball, and purchases a cheap free kick from Matic, coming in from behind in the clumsy style. This is a dangerous position, 30 yards out, just to the right of centre. 13 min: ... Wolves nearly score. They should score, in fact. The corner from the left is flicked on by Dendoncker to Doherty, who should slot home at the far post. But Romero sticks out a strong hand to deny the Wolves right-back. A sensational save, though Romero should never have been allowed to make it. 12 min: Pereira gives up the ball with absurd ease in the centre circle, allowing Neto to burst down the middle of the park. He lays off to Traore on his right. The winger earns a corner off Williams. Saiss rises highest to meet the corner, but his header\u2019s deflected out out to the left for another corner. From which ... 10 min: Vinagre embarks on a fine dribble down the left, but Chong sticks to him well and the Wolves wing-back runs out of room. Vinagre strokes the ball out for a goal kick. 9 min: There is surely no way this match will end goalless. Both teams are full of attacking vim and vigour. The game\u2019s very open, and everyone looks in the mood. The FA Cup, right here! 7 min: United take their turn to counter. James skedaddles down the left and wins a corner. They faff around at the set piece, but United work a second phase of play and Greenwood drops a shoulder down the inside-left channel, working space for a shot just inside the box. He leans back and skies his effort, but that was a crisp run. He\u2019s a real prospect all right. 6 min: Ashley-Seal goes straight up the other end, a direct, no-nonsense run down the inside-left channel. He wins a corner off Maguire. The set piece is easily snaffled by Romero. 5 min: Pereira is clumsily bundled over by Neto, out on the United right. A chance to load the box. Pereira takes it himself, and it\u2019s a ludicrous delivery, mishit and flat, and straight into Ashley-Seal\u2019s coupon, ten yards away. That\u2019s dismal, with the box teeming with scoring potential. 3 min: Doherty launches long from the left-back position. There\u2019s an absurd amount of space between the United centre-backs, and Ashley-Seal nearly latches onto the ball. He\u2019d have been able to zip clear towards goal. Fortunately for United, Romero was out to cover and clear. Fair to say this has been an open start. 2 min: James probes down the left and for a second threatens to burst into the box. Wolves hold their shape and the young winger is forced to turn tail. But this has been a fine front-foot start by United. 1 min: Nearly a sensational start for United, as Chong is afforded way too much space 40 yards from goal. He tries to slip James away down the middle, but his pass is no good. A better ball, and the hosts would have been a goal up within 3o seconds. A quick burst of Hi Ho Wolverhampton ... anywhere you go now baby ... and we\u2019re off! The visitors get the ball rolling. Molineux is bouncing. The third round of the FA Cup, right here. The teams are out! One stunning stadium, two gorgeous kits. Wolves are in their famous old gold, while United have opted to wear their black change shirt, shades of Eric Cantona, Sharp Viewcam, all that. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. One minute later than usual. Here\u2019s the heads up ... A reminder that there are some other ties being played this evening. The incomparable Rob Smyth will keep you up to date with Bournemouth-Luton, Fleetwood-Portsmouth, Leicester-Wigan and Manchester City-Port Vale. He\u2019s been at Clockwatch since the break of dawn, too, pretty much. Rumours that he\u2019s also powering the National Grid via some pedals under his desk have yet to be verified. Then a cheery Ole Gunnar Solskjaer adds: \u201cWe have to learn from our Arsenal performance. We\u2019ve had improvements in the games we have played against Wolves in the last ten months. It\u2019s about performing, turning out. I know when we play to our best, we have the chance to beat anyone. Tahith Chong has been bright lately with the reserves and gets his chance. Anthony Martial is ill, so it\u2019s a matter for Mason Greenwood to take his chance again.\u201d A relaxed Nuno Espirito Santo speaks to BT Sport. \u201cWe must play good, be organised, and compete. Benny Ashley-Seal is ready, I hope he competes well and enjoys the game. Man United are a fantastic team. They are such a huge club, you have to really go for it and compete well.\u201d Catharsis. Here\u2019s what happened to Wolves after that quarter-final triumph, and how they eventually escaped from the slough of despond. Bringing things a little more up to date ... this is a repeat of last year\u2019s quarter final. Paul Doyle was on hand to witness that one, and here\u2019s his memory-refreshing report. En route to Molineux, you\u2019ll see this. Memories of Wolverhampton Wanderers\u2019 last FA Cup win. Bill Slater, there, lifting the famous old pot at the famous old Wembley in 1960, after a 3-0 win over injury-depleted Blackburn Rovers. Norman Deeley was Wolves\u2019 two-goal hero in the second half that day. The first had been a nightmare for Rovers: the unfortunate Mick McGrath had opened the scoring by putting through his own net, then Dave Whelan broke his leg. No subs back then. It wasn\u2019t much of a spectacle, and Wolves were pelted with apple cores, orange peel and screwed-up newspaper on their victory lap. Poor Wolves, who had just been pipped to the title by Burnley, getting no respect. The past, kids, another country. Wolves make four changes to the XI sent out for the defeat at Watford on New Year\u2019s Day. John Ruddy, Max Kilman, Ruben Vinagre, Ruben Neves and under-23 scoring sensation Benny Ashley-Seal take the places of Rui Patricio, Ryan Bennett, Jonny Otto, Joao Moutinho and Raul Jimenez. United also ring the changes. Seven, they\u2019ve made, with only Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Daniel James and Nemanja Matic keeping their places after the miserable 2-0 non-event at Arsenal. In come Sergio Romero, Ashley Young, Brandon Williams, Andreas Pereira, Tahith Chong, Juan Mata and Mason Greenwood, as David de Gea, Luke Shaw, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Jesse Lingard, Fred, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford rest up. Wolverhampton Wanderers: Ruddy, Doherty, Dendoncker, Coady, Kilman, Vinagre, Saiss, Neves, Traore, Ashley-Seal, Neto. Subs: Patricio, Bennett, Raul, Otto, Moutinho, Otasowie, Rasmussen. Manchester United: Romero, Young, Lindelof, Maguire, Williams, Pereira, Matic, Chong, Mata, James, Greenwood. Subs: Grant, Dalot, Jones, Wan-Bissaka, Fred, Gomes, Rashford. Manchester United played Wolverhampton Wanderers for the very first time in October 1892. They were trading at the time as Newton Heath, and won the First Division fixture by the whopping scoreline of 10-1. Not a great day at the office for Wolves\u2019 captain and defensive linchpin Harry Allen, though fortunes can change quickly in football, and he ended the season by scoring the winner against Everton in the FA Cup final. Not sure what relevance this has, but having found it out, it seemed silly not to at least mention it. Wolves have won three more FA Cups since then. They saw off Newcastle United in the 1908 final, beat Leicester City 3-1 in 1949 (having beaten Matt Busby\u2019s holders in the semi) and trounced ten-man Blackburn Rovers in 1960, whereupon they were pelted with rubbish by the crowd, the match having been that boring. Manchester United have meanwhile gone on to win this grand old competition 12 times. Let\u2019s not list them, we\u2019ll be here all day. Their last victory came in 2016, when popularity\u2019s Jesse Lingard snatched a late extra-time winner against Crystal Palace. The way things have been going for the poor bugger lately, he\u2019d do well to get back on the scoring trail today. It\u2019s a tough ask for United, mind. They\u2019re an inconsistent rabble, capable at times of jaw-dropping brilliance (away at Manchester City) but also mind-numbing ineptitude (at Arsenal the other day). They lost here at Molineux in this competition last year. And Wolves are in a much happier place on the achievement/expectation spectrum right now, despite losing their last two Premier League games. Wolves threw away the chance of making their first final since 1960 last season. They\u2019d love to go at least one better this time round. But United will be desperate for a fillip, and a big FA Cup win, followed by a good showing in the first leg of the League Cup semi against neighbours City on Tuesday, could abruptly alter the mood music in the red half of Manchester and turn a difficult season into a much more promising affair. Plenty riding on this, then. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.31pm GMT. Heads up.",

      "body": "<p>When Brendan Rodgers signed a five-and-a-half-year contract extension last month, he cited a desire to win trophies and, after watching Leicester brush aside Wigan to reach the FA Cup fourth round, his team continue to fight on three fronts.</p> <p>Liverpool\u2019s 13-point lead in the Premier League seems insurmountable but Leicester could still earn silverware in the domestic cups. On Wednesday they face Aston Villa in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-finals, when Rodgers will surely restore several of the big hitters that were rested here, notably James Maddison.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/04/rochdale-newcastle-united-fa-cup-match-report\">Rochdale veteran Aaron Wilbraham takes Newcastle to FA Cup replay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last season Leicester exited this competition at this stage at Newport, a defeat that left Claude Puel on borrowed time. But a year on, and in safer surrounds, they dispatched Championship opposition courtesy of an own goal and a strike by Harvey Barnes, who operated as a No 9 for the evening.</p> <p>For Wigan, who had a second-half strike by Jamal Lowe ruled out by the video assistant referee, there was to be no repeat of their 2017-18 Cup heroics, when they knocked out Bournemouth, West Ham United and Manchester City before coming unstuck in the quarter-finals.</p> <p>Not everything went to plan for Rodgers, with the defenders Wes Morgan and Filip Benkovic forced off with groin and ankle injuries respectively.</p> <p>Caglar Soyuncu, who replaced Morgan after 25 minutes, will start against Villa alongside Jonny Evans, who was among those given a breather here as Rodgers made 10 changes. Yet Leicester are short of defensive cover, necessitating their pursuit of the Juventus centre-back Merih Demiral. As it happened, Leicester\u2019s defence were rarely stretched and it was a new-look attack, spearheaded by the electric Barnes, which encouraged Rodgers.</p> <p>\u201cThat was the experiment, to have a look at that,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHe has played up there when he was [on loan] at West Brom, in and around the front line. It is helping his flexibility and understanding of the game. Because of his pace and his threat it was a chance for us to have a look at him through the middle. He got his goal, he worked very hard and looked a threat.\u201d</p> <p>It was a pleasing night\u2019s work for a much-changed Leicester, with Ben Chilwell the only survivor from the team that won at Newcastle on New Year\u2019s Day. Danny Ward, who replaced Kasper Schmeichel in goal, had little to do but claw away a Gavin Massey cross and Benkovic, who impressed under Rodgers on loan at Celtic, was composed until being forced off.</p> <p>Barnes, meanwhile, was tasked with the responsibility of leading the line a la Jamie Vardy, who returned to training on Saturday morning following a calf complaint. The 22-year-old was a constant menace for the Wigan backline, leading defender C\u00e9dric Kipr\u00e9 to crudely clothesline the makeshift striker.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/04/fulham-aston-villa-fa-cup-match-report\">Harry Arter\u2019s long-range winner fires Fulham past weakened Aston Villa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was a mismatch in most senses but Wigan, 39 places below the hosts in the pyramid, made Leicester think before Tom Pearce\u2019s own goal gifted the Foxes the lead on 19 minutes. Barnes\u2019s performance deserved a goal and he doubled Leicester\u2019s advantage five minutes before the interval after applying the finishing touch to a crisp counterattack.</p> <p>As debuts go, Pearce\u2019s was memorable for the wrong reasons, with the Wigan defender inadvertently sweeping Marc Albrighton\u2019s cross beyond his own goalkeeper, David Marshall. It was Pearce\u2019s cross that Lowe volleyed in from close range, only for VAR to intervene at a time when Leicester were getting comfortable.</p> <p>\u201cTo get through was very important for us,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cSome players came in and got games which was great but of course our process here is always about performance and of course we can play better.</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t good enough on the ball.

      "bodyText": "When Brendan Rodgers signed a five-and-a-half-year contract extension last month, he cited a desire to win trophies and, after watching Leicester brush aside Wigan to reach the FA Cup fourth round, his team continue to fight on three fronts. Liverpool\u2019s 13-point lead in the Premier League seems insurmountable but Leicester could still earn silverware in the domestic cups. On Wednesday they face Aston Villa in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-finals, when Rodgers will surely restore several of the big hitters that were rested here, notably James Maddison. Last season Leicester exited this competition at this stage at Newport, a defeat that left Claude Puel on borrowed time. But a year on, and in safer surrounds, they dispatched Championship opposition courtesy of an own goal and a strike by Harvey Barnes, who operated as a No 9 for the evening. For Wigan, who had a second-half strike by Jamal Lowe ruled out by the video assistant referee, there was to be no repeat of their 2017-18 Cup heroics, when they knocked out Bournemouth, West Ham United and Manchester City before coming unstuck in the quarter-finals. Not everything went to plan for Rodgers, with the defenders Wes Morgan and Filip Benkovic forced off with groin and ankle injuries respectively. Caglar Soyuncu, who replaced Morgan after 25 minutes, will start against Villa alongside Jonny Evans, who was among those given a breather here as Rodgers made 10 changes. Yet Leicester are short of defensive cover, necessitating their pursuit of the Juventus centre-back Merih Demiral. As it happened, Leicester\u2019s defence were rarely stretched and it was a new-look attack, spearheaded by the electric Barnes, which encouraged Rodgers. \u201cThat was the experiment, to have a look at that,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHe has played up there when he was [on loan] at West Brom, in and around the front line. It is helping his flexibility and understanding of the game. Because of his pace and his threat it was a chance for us to have a look at him through the middle. He got his goal, he worked very hard and looked a threat.\u201d It was a pleasing night\u2019s work for a much-changed Leicester, with Ben Chilwell the only survivor from the team that won at Newcastle on New Year\u2019s Day. Danny Ward, who replaced Kasper Schmeichel in goal, had little to do but claw away a Gavin Massey cross and Benkovic, who impressed under Rodgers on loan at Celtic, was composed until being forced off. Barnes, meanwhile, was tasked with the responsibility of leading the line a la Jamie Vardy, who returned to training on Saturday morning following a calf complaint. The 22-year-old was a constant menace for the Wigan backline, leading defender C\u00e9dric Kipr\u00e9 to crudely clothesline the makeshift striker. This was a mismatch in most senses but Wigan, 39 places below the hosts in the pyramid, made Leicester think before Tom Pearce\u2019s own goal gifted the Foxes the lead on 19 minutes. Barnes\u2019s performance deserved a goal and he doubled Leicester\u2019s advantage five minutes before the interval after applying the finishing touch to a crisp counterattack. As debuts go, Pearce\u2019s was memorable for the wrong reasons, with the Wigan defender inadvertently sweeping Marc Albrighton\u2019s cross beyond his own goalkeeper, David Marshall. It was Pearce\u2019s cross that Lowe volleyed in from close range, only for VAR to intervene at a time when Leicester were getting comfortable. \u201cTo get through was very important for us,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cSome players came in and got games which was great but of course our process here is always about performance and of course we can play better. \u201cWe weren\u2019t good enough on the ball. The players gave everything, which they always do, but we have to be better and much cleaner with the ball. We could have had the ball for longer periods than we did but that was my only grumble.\u201d",

These all-dayers are getting out of hand. It was the Premier League on New Year\u2019s Day, and today it\u2019s an FA Cup third round special. First orders will be at 12.31pm, when the opening round of matches kick off. There are more games at 3.01pm, then a third lot starting at 5.31pm.</p> <p>We\u2019ll have separate MBMs for the two televised games, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/04/rochdale-v-newcastle-united-fa-cup-live\">Rochdale v Newcastle</a> and Wolves v Man Utd while muggins here will attempt to keep up with all the other games. The unusual kick-off times, as you are probably aware, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/03/footballers-mental-health-messages-to-be-shown-before-fa-cup-ties\">are so that we can take a minute or three to think about mental health</a>. Football has come a long way in the 21 years since Stan Collymore was made a pariah.</p> <p>Alas, the FA Cup has become a bit of an outcast in that time, certainly in comparison to the big Leagues. We\u2019re all friends here, so let us speak frankly: the FA Cup third round does not have the <em>magic/romance/insert preferred cliche here</em> it once did. It will never mean as much as it did in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/07/fa-cup-third-round-field-notes\">the days of Ronnie Radford, Matthew Hanlan and Micky Thomas</a>. (The saddest thing about the FA Cup, since you asked, is that its greatest day, 8 April 1990, <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/espn-fc-united/68/post/2402854/the-greatest-ever-fa-cup-semifinals\">hastened its demise</a>.)</p> <p>It is still English football\u2019s greatest giantkilling canvas, though, and the likelihood is that, at some stage this weekend, a few players will define their careers. Maybe even their lives.<br></p> <h2>Today\u2019s fixtures</h2> <p><strong><br>12.31pm</strong><br></p> <ul> <li>Birmingham v Blackburn</li> <li>Bristol City v Shrewsbury Town</li> <li>Burnley v Peterborough</li> <li>Millwall v Newport County</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/04/rochdale-v-newcastle-united-fa-cup-live\">Rochdale v Newcastle</a></li> <li>Rotherham v Hull</li> </ul> <p><strong>3.01pm</strong></p> <ul> <li>Brentford v Stoke</li> <li>Brighton v Sheffield Wednesday</li> <li>Cardiff v Carlisle</li> <li>Fulham v Aston Villa</li> <li>Oxford v Hartlepools</li> <li>Preston v Norwich</li> <li>Reading v Blackpool</li> <li>Southampton v Huddersfield</li> <li>Watford v Tranmere</li> </ul> <p><strong>5.31pm</strong></p> <ul> <li>Bournemouth v Luton</li> <li>Fleetwood v Portsmouth</li> <li>Leicester v Wigan</li> <li>Manchester City v Port Vale</li> <li>Wolves v Manchester United</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T12:12:24.016Z\">at 12.12pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Barnes in the groove. Not a classic ... That\u2019s it for bumper FA Cup clockwatch. I\u2019ll leave you with a few match reports from around the country. Thanks for your company, emails and calm-inducing observations on VAR. Goodnight! The full-time scores in the 5.31pm games Bournemouth 4-0 Luton Fleetwood 1-2 Portsmouth Leicester City 2-0 Wigan Athletic Manchester City 4-1 Port Vale Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Brendan Rodgers maintains his perfect record in the FA Cup third round. Portsmouth hang on to reach the last 32. A comfortable evening for Eddie Howe. Life is precious, dear friend, and if you watched that game you have just wasted two hours of it. A predictably easy victory for City. But the real winner was Tom Pope. Conor McAleny gets a non-consolation goal for Fleetwood. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any VAR problems in Scotland, Rob, largely due to the fact that we don\u2019t have VAR,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lesson in there for all of us. Peace and love. X \u201cPS If we did Scotland would have won the 1978 World Cup. \u201cPPS Lol.\u201d I can\u2019t wait for the post-match interview Take that, \u201cVAR\u201d. After having a goal ruled out in the first half, Dominic Solanke finally scores his first goal for Bournemouth. This is my favourite email of a very long day, the dry musings of a man ready to do time for his beliefs \u201cI can see how there might have been some confusion on City\u2019s third goal,\u201d says J.R in Illinois. \u201cOn first viewing it looked like Harwood-Bellis\u2019s left buttcheek hairs may have been standing in an offside position when Stones\u2019s shot went in off him. But upon closer inspection the fraying fabric on the outside of the collar lining of Leon Legge\u2019s left boot was clearly and obviously playing Harwood-Bellis onside. Good goal.\u201d The latest scores Bournemouth 3-0 Luton Fleetwood 0-2 Portsmouth Leicester City 2-0 Wigan Athletic Manchester City 4-1 Port Vale Wolves 0-0 Manchester United A second goal for Philip Billing. Manchester City 4-1 Port Vale \u201cHow does Katharine Tabarner know (VAR and City 3rd goal)?\u201d says Neil Truby. \u201cI\u2019m in the bloody stadium and we haven\u2019t a clue how or what was going on!\u201d It\u2019s almost as if football has sold its soul to television! Phil Foden makes the most of a rare start, scoring his third goal of the season to seal victory for City. Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Wolves have had a goal disallowed for handball at Molineux. They have been much the better side in the second half. And John Marquis does likewise for Portsmouth. The substitute Callum Wilson scores with his first touch to seal victory, probably, for Bournemouth. Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Marcus Rashford has hit the bar 27 seconds after coming on as substitute. Portsmouth, who won the FA Cup in 2008 (yes, yes, and 1939) and reached the final in 2010 (yes, yes, and 1929 and 1934), are ahead at Fleetwood thanks to James Bolton. Manchester City 3-1 Port Vale Here\u2019s Katharine Tabarner with a full explanation of that third City goal. \u201cAguero headed across the area, the ball broke for Stones and it deflected off the calf of the youngster on its way in. The VAR check took ages with lines being drawn and redrawn.\u201d The latest scores Bournemouth 1-0 Luton Fleetwood 0-0 Portsmouth Leicester City 2-0 Wigan Athletic Manchester City 3-1 Tom Pope Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Manchester City 3-1 Port Vale I\u2019ll be honest, I haven\u2019t a clue what happened with that third City goal, primarily because I haven\u2019t seen it. It sounds like there was a VAR check for offside after John Stones had scored, and then the goal was given to Taylor Harwood-Bellis because it hit him on the line. No he hasn\u2019t - it was the 17-year-old Taylor Harwood-Bellis who scored on his home debut! Stones got the assist. John Stones has equalised against Tom Pope! The latest scores Bournemouth 1-0 Luton Fleetwood 0-0 Portsmouth Leicester City 2-0 Wigan Athletic Manchester City 2-1 Tom Pope Wolves 0-0 Manchester United \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing more entertaining than seeing players give it the big one, it\u2019s seeing players give it the big one and then delivering,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cGood on Pope. Great to see him get a goal.\u201d Indeed. If you haven\u2019t heard his Undr the Cosh interview, it\u2019s hugely entertaining. I can\u2019t recommend Undr the Cosh enough; it\u2019s consistently brilliant. Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Wolves, with Raul Jimenez on as sub, have started the second half superbly at Molineux. Scott Murray has the latest. The half-time scores Bournemouth 1-0 Luton Fleetwood 0-0 Portsmouth Leicester City 2-0 Wigan Athletic Manchester City 2-1 Port Vale Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Bournemouth 1-0 Luton Late drama in the first half, with Luton\u2019s Alan Sheehan smacking a penalty against the bar in the seventh minute of added time. Wolves 0-0 Manchester United It\u2019s half-time at Molineux. Scott Murray is following that one. Port Vale were level for seven minutes (not counting the mezzanine VAR check). But it doesn\u2019t matter how many City score now; Tom Pope has already won. Harvey Barnes doubles Leicester\u2019s lead. That should - should - be enough. Twitter\u2019s Tom Pope has equalised for Port Vale! It was a terrific header, apparently, though sadly it didn\u2019t involve John Stones being left in a heap. Manchester City 1-0 Port Vale \u201cOne yard out, open goal, falling backwards,\u201d writes J.A Hopkin. \u201cDavid Silva hits the bar...\u201d I love this groundbreaking form of journalism, whereby the readers tell the writer what\u2019s happening. Wolves 0-0 Manchester United That might have been a penalty for United, with Brandon Williams apparently taken down by Leander Dendoncker. Paul Tierney, the on-field referee, was not interested and VAR backed him up. If you substitute a herbal tea such as peppermint for more stimulating drinks such as coffee and 94%ABV liquor, your ability to be calm will be enhanced many times. Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Half an hour gone. Manchester United have had loads of possession, and you know what that means: it\u2019s 0-0. Harry Maguire is struggling with what looks like a hip problem. That would be a huge blow at the best of times, never mind when you have Manchester City (twice) and Liverpool to play this month. \u201cNice try with this pseudo-Zen attitude you\u2019re adopting towards that which should not be mentioned,\u201d says Charlie. \u201cBut you\u2019re not fooling anyone, and we both know that by the end of this round of games you\u2019re going to be a raging, spluttering wreck because someone\u2019s toe was offside. If you keep trying to bottle it up, at some point in the next ninety minutes there\u2019s going to be an explosion in King\u2019s Place that will be heard throughout the land.\u201d Let\u2019s hope so. The latest scores Bournemouth 1-0 Luton Fleetwood 0-0 Portsmouth Leicester City 1-0 Wigan Athletic Manchester City 1-0 Port Vale Wolves 0-0 Manchester United \u201cLast season I followed the Coupe de France and to these foreign eyes it seems to have oodles of romance,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cA story like today\u2019s, a team traveling to mainland France from an island in the Indian Ocean and emerging victorious, just couldn\u2019t happen in any other national competition I know of. The Magique of the Coupe.\u201d You betcha. Apart from Wolves v Man Utd, which is live on BT Sport, we can\u2019t see the goals from the 5.31pm games, hence the Pulitzer-bothering entries below. It\u2019s also there! It\u2019s there! As well as being a boor and a bore, VAR has now been exposed as heartless swine: Dominic Solanke\u2019s goal has been ruled out for an offside in the build-up. A year and a day after joining the club, Dominic Solanke finally scores his first goal for Bournemouth! Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Sergio Romero has just made an outstanding reaction save at Molineux. Manchester United don\u2019t have much to boast about these days, but they can claim one of the best reserve goalkeepers in the world. \u201cI once won a lifetime supply of Marmite in a newspaper competition, Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI\u2019ve still got the jar; I can send it to you if you\u2019re interested.\u201d \u201cIn my opinion, match broadcasts should be labelled to indicate whether or not VAR is in use,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cKind of like the \u2018gluten-free\u2019 and \u2018non-GMO\u2019 labels on food products.\u201d VAR, you say? Well, most worries are future-based. They revolve around things that, in most cases, will never happen. Concentrate on the present and the future will take care of itself. Bournemouth have been struggling of late, but Philip Billing has given them an early lead against occasional giant-killers Luton. \u201cPort Vale NOT Preston,\u201d says Anne Oakes of an earlier mistake that has now been corrected so there\u2019s no point me linking to it because it\u2019s no longer there. \u201cI am a Burslem ex-pat in France enjoying the end of the festivities so I have nothing better to do than point out your mistake...\u201d Ach, I thought nobody has spotted. Peep peep! The 5.31pm games are under way. Scott Murray is also following Wolves v Man Utd. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Grant Tennille. \u201cWading in ill-advisedly, I feel certain, but re: jinxing/tempting fate at Watford, how early is too early to deem something a \u2018consolation\u2019 goal? If this question has shades of the whole \u2018what makes a foul \u201dtactical\u201d\u2019 discussion, then please accept my apologies.\u201d Consolation goals, like beauty and Marmite, are in the eye of the beholder. I suppose the events of 4 February 2004 should have taught us there is no such thing as a foregone conclusion. And here\u2019s your hot-off-the-press report on Watford\u2019s spectacular capitulation Tranmere\u2019s heroic comeback at Vicarage Road: And these are the late kick-offs Bournemouth v Luton Fleetwood v Portsmouth Leicester City v Wigan Athletic Manchester City v Port Vale (aka John Stones v Tom Pope) Wolves v Manchester United And our take from the south coast, where Brighton came unstuck against Sheffield Wednesday: Our match report from Fulham: The biggest cup shock of the day has come in France: \u201cWay to go Rob,\u201d says Ivar Laanen. \u201cYou really jinxed Watford with your little speech, in which you said, \u2018They\u2019ve played four home games under Nigel Pearson, including today, and it\u2019s probably not tempting fate to suggest they have won all four.\u2019 It\u2019s your fault Tranmere came back. Well done.\u201d You make a fair point. I suppose I would say there is seldom any rational reason for having regrets about past deeds or events. Because the past does not exist in any other way than in your memory. When you recognise this lack of reality, you can be calm. Peep peep! That\u2019s it for the 3.01pm matches. I\u2019m going to take a short break, but will be back for the 5.31pm kick-offs. The full-time scores Brentford 1-0 Stoke Brighton 0-1 Sheffield Wednesday Cardiff 2-2 Carlisle Fulham 2-1 Aston Villa Oxford 4-1 Hartlepool Preston 2-4 Norwich Reading 2-2 Blackpool Southampton 2-0 Huddersfield Watford 3-3 Tranmere A dog of a game, by all accounts, but Brentford are through. Two teenagers, Will Smallbone and Jake Vokins, scored to give Southampton a comfortable victory. Non-league Hartlepool threatened a shock when they led in the first half, but Oxford were too good after the break. Two brilliant goals from Anthony Knockaert and Harry Arter give Fulham victory over Premier League Aston Villa. Cardiff come from 2-0 down at half-time to avoid a shock defeat. That was a cracking game, and included a Panenka that hit the bar from Armand Gnanduillet. Peep peep! League One Tranmere come from three goals down at half-time to earn a replay. The Irish teenager Adam Idah\u2019s accomplished hat-trick puts Norwich through without alarm. Peep peep! Sheffield Wednesday have put Premier League Brighton out of the FA Cup. Another teenager, Jake Vokins, seals Southampton\u2019s place in the last 32 with a deflected shot. Only Liverpool and Manchester City have scored more goals in all competitions than Oxford this season. \u201cThe way it\u2019s used at the moment, VAR is not conducive to anyone\u2019s mental health and well-being, I reckon,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cThe powers that be should try the more mindful approach to decision making pioneered by the MBM. Seriously. Just ask the MBM. It\u2019d be quicker, and more accurate.\u201d I agree. Add a dab of lavender to milk, leave town with an orange and pretend you\u2019re laughing at it. Tariqe Fosu-Henry scores an open goal to seal an impressive comeback from Oxford. Watford 3-3 Tranmere He kicked out at a Tranmere player, and he\u2019s off. Paul Mullin hammers it down the middle! Tranmere, who were lucky to be 3-0 down at half-time, are level! Blah blah, Tranmere have a penalty! Oh my days. Ther\u2019s more football after this \u201cAccording to the commentator, Monthe is pronounced Montay,\u201d says Mac Millings, \u201cso I\u2019m guessing his nickname is Burns.\u201d The latest scores Brentford 1-0 Stoke Brighton 0-1 Sheffield Wednesday Cardiff 2-2 Carlisle Fulham 2-1 Aston Villa Oxford 2-1 Hartlepool Preston 1-4 Norwich Reading 2-2 Blackpool Southampton 1-0 Huddersfield Watford 3-2 Tranmere \u201cHow about that hat-trick for the young Cork man, Idah?\u201d says J.R in Illinois. \u201cPretty sweet. And here is where I mention that if they had been using VAR his third goal would have been chalked off as he was offside before he won the penalty. Sorry. VAR is so terrible that even when it isn\u2019t in use the mere fact that it exists is so disheartening as to ruin non-VAR games as well.\u201d VAR, you say? There is little doubt that those who get the most from life are those who look for the wonder in even the smallest things they do. Cultivate this skill and you\u2019ll find peace and satisfaction as well. Crikey. A mistake from the Watford keeper Daniel Bachmann allows Emmanuel Monthe to bring Tranmere right back into the match. If his nickname isn\u2019t Cremda, then the world is going to hell in a handcart. \u201cYou\u2019ve accidentally added the word \u2018again\u2019 to the end of that sentence (4.20pm),\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201c(Also, what could a therapist possibly offer you that you can\u2019t get from an extensive network of well-balanced, rational, intelligent MBM correspondents?)\u201d I\u2019m sorry, I thought that was a rhetorical question. Fulham are ahead for the second time thanks to the on-loan Harry Arter. Oxford have battered Hartlepool in the second half and deserve their lead. It\u2019s a beautiful solo goal, too, from Shannon Baptiste, who moves elegantly through the defence and eases the ball into the net. For the love of blood pressure, I can\u2019t keep up with this. Arnand Gnanduillet has missed a penalty for Blackpool, Panenkaing it onto the crossbar. Reading equalise for the second time! Connor Jennings gets a consolation goal for Tranmere. Fulham 1-1 Aston Villa That goal came from Anwar El Ghazi, who apparently nicked it off Jonathan Kodjia. Jack Reach\u2019s deflected free-kick has given Sheffield Wednesday the lead at the Amex Stadium! Villa are level! But another Premier League team are in trouble... There\u2019s your third round fairytale! Adam Idah, the 18-year-old striker from Cork, scores from the penalty spot to complete a hat-trick on his FA Cup debut. Reading were level for only four minutes. Armand Gnanduillet has restored Blackpool\u2019s lead with a thunderbast- spectacular strike. \u201cThe main problem with VAR isn\u2019t the V part, it\u2019s the AR part, the human part,\u201d says J.R. in Illinois. \u201cI have seen the VAR make some seriously grievous decisions but you should have seen me at the moment I realised that they were using VAR in some, but not all, FA Cup matches. I was literally shocked and my mouth involuntarily hung open for several moments in disbelief. What rocket scientists came up with that plan? And why am I surprised even though I know I shouldn\u2019t be?\u201d I wish I could reply, but my therapist says I need to stop talking about VAR and start loving myself again. The latest scores Brentford 1-0 Stoke Brighton 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday Cardiff 2-2 Carlisle Fulham 1-0 Aston Villa Oxford 1-1 Hartlepool Preston 0-3 Norwich Reading 1-1 Blackpool Southampton 1-0 Huddersfield Watford 3-0 Tranmere Another equaliser, this time at the Madejski Stadium, thanks to a stinging shot from Sam Baldock. Cardiff have scored twice in the first 10 minutes of the second half, with Gavin Whyte grabbing the equaliser. Brighton 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday Steven Fletcher has been stretchered off with what sounds like a very bad injury. He landed awkwardly on a straight leg, and the BT Sport pundits think it could be a cruciate-ligament injury. At the age of 32, that\u2019s especially worrying. Robert Hall scores a fine goal, not dissimilar to Knockaert\u2019s, to equalise for Oxford against non-league Hartlepools. Aston Villa could be the first Premier League side to go out of the FA Cup. Anthony Knockaert moves infield from the right and whips a beautiful curling shot into the top corner. That\u2019s a lovely goal. Cardiff are back in the game thanks to Callum Paterson. Yep. The impressive teenager Will Smallbone marks his debut with an accomplished finish to give Southampton the lead. Preston pull one back at the start of the second half. A corner bounces around the Norwich area before Billy Bodin does the necessary. \u201cAlbion Rovers 0-3 Stirling Albion is the half time at Cliftonhill,\u201d writes our unpaid etc. Simon McMahon. \u201cThis year is the 100th anniversary of Rovers\u2019 solitary appearance in a major cup final, the 1920 Scottish Cup. Having beaten Rangers in a second replay to reach the final, they lost 3-2 to Kilmarnock in front of 95,000 at Hampden. Apparently their goalkeeper arrived at Hampden direct from the cells, having been somewhat \u2018tired and emotional\u2019 the previous evening.\u201d And some people have the effrontery to say football has never been better. \u201cWatford cruised to a 3-0 lead at the break,\u201d writes our unpaid intern American Watford correspondent Mac Millings. \u201cThe Hornets really didn\u2019t create an awful lot, but when they did, they made it count, with three beautifully taken goals. Tranmere have worked hard, and their travelling support have been tremendous, but Watford simply have too much quality for them. Dele-Bashiru in particular has looked sharp.\u201d The half-time scores Brentford 1-0 Stoke Brighton 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday Cardiff 0-2 Carlisle Fulham 0-0 Aston Villa Oxford 0-1 Hartlepool Preston 0-3 Norwich Reading 0-1 Blackpool Southampton 0-0 Huddersfield Watford 3-0 Tranmere There\u2019s a shock on in Wales. Harry McKirdy has put Carlisle, who sit 21st in League Two, a couple of goals ahead against the Championship side Cardiff. Shane Long has a goal disallowed for an unclear and unobvious offside. Emiliano Marcondes scores for 2021\u2019s hipster favourites. Brighton 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday \u201cSteven Fletcher\u2019s barnet looks magnificent,\u201d says John Hartson on BT Sport. \u201cHe had less hair than me 12 months ago. Now he looks like Rod Stewart!\u201d The exciting Irish teenager Adam Idah gets his second, clipping the ball into an empty net from 40 yards. He looks a prospect, this lad. The latest scores Brentford 0-0 Stoke Brighton 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday Cardiff 0-1 Carlisle Fulham 0-0 Aston Villa Oxford 0-1 Hartlepool Preston 0-2 Norwich Reading 0-1 Blackpool Southampton 0-0 Huddersfield Watford 3-0 Tranmere Watford\u2019s spectacular revival continues. They\u2019ve played four home games under Nigel Pearson, including today, and it\u2019s probably not tempting fate to suggest they have won all four. Roberto Pereyra has put them 3-0 up against Tranmere with a classy finish. ICYMI, the biggest story of the early games came at Spotland, where 17-year-old Luke Matheson set up 40-year-old Aaron Wilbraham to earn a deserved replay for Rochdale against Norwich. Blackpool lead against the run of play. Nathan Delfouneso, the former England Under-21 striker, has scored from close range. A mistake from the Preston keeper Connor Ripley allows Onel Hernandez to double Norwich\u2019s lead. Southampton 0-0 Huddersfield Southampton might have had a penalty for a shirt pull on Jan Vestergaard. VAR is being used, but decided it was not a clear and obvious foul. Don\u2019t go there, I\u2019m on a VAR detox. \u201cFrom the photo of Millwall\u2019s third goal,\u201d begins Peter Littley, \u201cit seems there were more goals than paying spectators.\u201d The latest scores Brentford 0-0 Stoke Brighton 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday Cardiff 0-1 Carlisle Fulham 0-0 Aston Villa Oxford 0-1 Hartlepool Preston 0-1 Norwich Reading 0-0 Blackpool Southampton 0-0 Huddersfield Watford 2-0 Tranmere Tranmere try to play out from the back. It doesn\u2019t go entirely to plan, and Nathaniel Chalobah makes it 2-0 to Watford. It\u2019s haemorrhaging goals in the FA Cup. Jack Bridge wins a dodgy penalty and takes it himself. His effort is saved but he scores from the replay. Watford Reserves take an early lead through a cracking long-range strike from Tom Dele-Bashiru. Non-league Hartlepool lead at Oxford! The home side faffed around in defence, allowing Mark Kitching to nip in and score. \u201cNo cup games in Scotland this week as the big boys take a break, but you don\u2019t get more romantic than the Scottish lower leagues, do you?\u201d swoons Simon McMahon. \u201cIn the Scottish Championship, runaway leaders Dundee United make the long trip to Dumfries to face Queen of the South. The Tannadice men have won nine and drawn one of their last ten in the league, establishing a 14-point lead over the chasing pack in the process. Their last defeat was at Queen of the South, though, a 4-0 shellacking at that, so they\u2019ll be keen to take revenge today. There\u2019s also an Albion derby as it\u2019s Albion Rovers v Stirling Albion. You don\u2019t get more romantic than that, eh?\u201d An early lead for Norwich, with the Irish teenager Adam Idah scoring very confidently from Marco Stiepermann\u2019s through pass. I am paraphrasing Chris Sutton on BT Sport here, as they are not allowed to show the goals from the 3.01pm kick-offs. Bah, gah and bah some more: it was fun being able to see the thing I have to describe during the early games. Peep peep! The 3.01pm games are under way. Here\u2019s the match report from our man in Rochdale: Peep peep! I\u2019m going to take a short break before the 3.01pm games begin. In the meantime, here\u2019s a quiz. The final scores in the 12.31pm kick-offs Birmingham 2-1 Blackburn Bristol City 1-1 Shrewsbury Town Burnley 4-2 Peterborough Millwall 3-0 Newport County Rochdale 1-1 Newcastle Rotherham 2-3 Hull Peep peep! Tom Eaves\u2019 earthy hat-trick has put Hull into the fourth round. Rotherham 2-3 Hull City Rotherham almost equalise straight away, with Reece Burke heading against his own post! Tom Eaves completes his hat-trick to put Hull into the next round! He headed home from close range after a scramble at a corner, and celebrated in style by whipping off his top to reveal a GPS vest. Jeremie Bela\u2019s late goal puts ten-man Birmingham in the last 32. An impressive performance from Shrewsbury, who could easily have won at Ashton Gate. A pretty comfortable victory for a strong Burnley side, who led 3-0 after 23 minutes and were never in danger after that. Peep peep! Aaron Wilbraham, the FA Cup\u2019s great quadragenarian, secures a lucrative and deserves replay for Rochdale against injury-hit Newcastle. Ten-man Birmingham have nicked it! Jeremie Bela moves into the area and sidefoots a low cross-shot through the keeper Jayson Leutwiler. That was poor keeping and even worse defending, with all the Blackburn players backing away from Bela in the area. An easy win for Gary Rowett\u2019s side. Rochdale 1-1 Newcastle Steve Bruce\u2019s side are hanging on for dear life, or at least a replay, at Spotland. Follow the last few minutes with Scott Murray. These are the 3.01pm fixtures, more of which anon. Brentford v Stoke Brighton v Sheffield Wednesday Cardiff v Carlisle Fulham v Aston Villa Oxford v Hartlepools Preston v Norwich Reading v Blackpool Southampton v Huddersfield Watford v Tranmere \u201cOh damn, somebody already beat me to it!\u201d says Adam Hirst, who has sent a link to that Malcolm Macdonald goal (1.49pm). \u201cThat\u2019ll teach me to concentrate on the cricket and only look in on you occasionally. Mind you, I bet that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing as well\u2026\u201d That\u2019s a despicable slur on my professionalism . I am completely focussed on the third round on the fact thaT DEAN ELGAR HAS JUST SLOGGED DOM BESS STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR! WOOHOO, YA DANCER! The latest scores Birmingham 1-1 Blackburn (Birmingham down to 10 men) Bristol City 1-1 Shrewsbury Town Burnley 4-2 Peterborough Millwall 3-0 Newport County Rochdale 1-1 Newcastle Rotherham 2-2 Hull (Rotherham down to 10 men) Millwall seal victory at the Den, with Tom Bradshaw sweeping in from close range. Oh my, this is a classic FA Cup story! Aaron Wilbraham, aged 40 (F-O-R-T-Y), has come off the bench to equalise for Rochdale against Newcastle. Scott Murray has more. The teenager Ricky Jade-Jones pulls one back for Peterborough, shinning a volley into the net from close range after a scramble at a corner. Millwall 2-0 Newport Joss Labadie is lucky to get only a yellow card after planting his studs into the calf of Connor Mahoney. Rotherham 2-2 Hull The referee spent an age talking to the assistant about whether the ball went out of play before Kane crossed for Eaves to score. That\u2019s all very strange, because there\u2019s no VAR, and it didn\u2019t go out of play anyway. Everyone\u2019s lost the noggin post-VAR. Hull are level against ten-man Rotherham. Tom Eaves gets his second goal, stretching to head into the net after a fine run down the left by Herbie Kane. Latest scores Birmingham 1-1 Blackburn (Birmingham down to 10 men) Bristol City 1-1 Shrewsbury Town Burnley 4-1 Peterborough Millwall 2-0 Newport County Rochdale 0-1 Newcastle Rotherham 2-1 Hull (Rotherham down to 10 men) Birmingham 1-1 Blackburn Sunjic only came on as a substitute two minutes before he was sent off. Good lad. Millwall double their lead through Connor Mahoney\u2019s calm penalty. Blackburn are level - and Birmingham are down to 10 men. Ivan Sunjic, mistaking himself for Franz Beckenbauer, gave the ball away to Sam Gallagher and compounded the mistake by shoving his over in the penalty area. He was sent off, and Adam Armstrong thumped the penalty down the middle. Rochdale 0-1 Newcastle Ian Henderson has hit the post for Rochdale, who are putting Newcastle under increasing pressure. This is a great spot from Gavin English \u201cRob, take a look at this \u2013 almost identical to Kyle Vassell\u2019s goal.\u201d Latest scores Birmingham 1-0 Blackburn Bristol City 1-1 Shrewsbury Town Burnley 4-1 Peterborough Millwall 1-0 Newport County Rochdale 0-1 Newcastle Rotherham 2-1 Hull (Rotherham down to 10 men) Rochdale 0-1 Newcastle What, another one? Yep, Newcastle have suffered their 48th injury of the festive period. Scott Murray has the details. Millwall 1-0 Newport Padraig Amond has missed a great chance for Newport, scuffing a loose ball wide from eight yards. Aaron Lennon plays a beautiful reverse pass to put Jay Rodriguez through, and he finishes with the minimum of fuss. Shrewsbury equalise with a fine goal. A corner was half cleared to Sean Goss, 25 yards from goal, and he curled a lovely, precise shot that went into the net off the far post. Half-time entertainment This is great, the end. Peep peep! It\u2019s half-time in the six 12.31pm games, and these are the scores: Birmingham 1-0 Blackburn Bristol City 1-0 Shrewsbury Town Burnley 3-1 Peterborough Millwall 1-0 Newport County Rochdale 0-1 Newcastle Rotherham 2-1 Hull (Rotherham down to 10 men) What a goal! Kyle Vassell has given 10-man Rotherham the lead with a spectacular goal from the left edge of the box. He allowed a short throw to run across his body, waited for the ball to bounce up and smashed a swirling shot that flew over Matt Ingram and into the far corner. It was very similiar to this goal from Steve McManaman, only better. You don\u2019t see many consolation goals in the first half, but Peterborough have got one at Turf Moor. Matthew Lowton\u2019s backheader was short, and Ivan Toney danced around Joe Hart to score confidently from a tight angle. \u201cMy favourite third round goal is Shane Long for Reading vs Liverpool in 2010,\u201d says Rob Evans. \u201cCold, possibly snowy weekday evening. We\u2019re playing well but it\u2019s Liverpool, and it\u2019s Anfield and somehow it is extra time. Reading favourite Bryn Gunnarson turns into Garrincha, throws in a Cruyff turn and a nutmeg before pinging in for Shane Long to score.\u201d \u201cI join Mr. Pearson in my astonishment that all the early matches are available here in the colonies,\u201d says James Thomas. \u201cI\u2019ve opted for Birmingham-Blackburn, although I\u2019m really waiting for Fulham-Aston Villa later. What do the Cottagers need to do, in your humble estimation, to earn promotion, and stick, this season?\u201d Erm, win the play-offs? I\u2019m no Championship expert \u2013 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m an anything expert \u2013 but it does look like Leeds and West Brom will be hard to catch. Bristol City 1-0 Shrewbury Town Ah, here we go. A short corner on the left, a deep cross and a precise looping header from Famara Diedhiou. I can\u2019t describe this one because BT Sport are currently on an ad break. Hotels.com, since you asked. Latest scores Birmingham 1-0 Blackburn Bristol City 0-0 Shrewsbury Town Burnley 3-0 Peterborough Millwall 1-0 Newport County Rochdale 0-1 Newcastle Rotherham 1-1 Hull (Rotherham down to 10 men) Rotherham 1-1 Hull Rotherham are down to 10 men. Adam Thompson has been sent off for a studs-up lunge at Keane Lewis-Potter. I suspect it was overzealous rather than malicious, but it was a dangerous tackle and he had to walk. \u201cMickey Thomas\u2019s free kick against for Wrexham against Arsenal would still be rising today had the net not stopped it,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cXabi Alonso scored against Luton from way inside his own half on his WRONG FOOT. But, although it might not be the most romantic or spectacular choice, Van Dijk\u2019s header against Everton two years ago looks like a turning point. He announced his arrival in style, and went on to have a ridiculously transformative effect on the team. That one probably gets my vote. I want to be VVD when I grow up.\u201d Jeff Hendrick\u2019s deflected shot from the edge of the area extendes Burnley\u2019s lead. An equaliser for Rotherham! Michael Smith, given too much time in the area, slams a rising shot into the top corner. The latest scores Birmingham 1-0 Blackburn Bristol City 0-0 Shrewsbury Town Burnley 2-0 Peterborough Millwall 1-0 Newport County Rochdale 0-1 Newcastle Rotherham 0-1 Hull \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Patrick O\u2019Brien. \u201cMy favourite MIKEL ARTETA!!!!! third round goal MIKEL!!!!! ARTE!!!!!TA was MIKEL ARTETA!!!!!!! when ... um, effing love MIKEL ARTETA me.\u201d Hull take a slightly underserved lead at the New York Stadium, with Tom Eaves dragging a low shot into the corner from close range. A neat finish from Miguel Almiron gives Newcastle a deserved lead. Scott Murray will tell you more. Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive, but to be a Clockwatcher was very heaven We can\u2019t see the goals when we do Premier League clockwatches, which makes for a peculiar experience. Thankfully BT Sport are allowed to show the goals from the 12.31pm games. It\u2019s quite an experience to actually describe the goals rather than paraphrase Paul Merson and Matt Le Tissier. Burnley are cruising into the fourth round. Erik Pieters, 25 yards out, thumps a bouncing ball across Christy Pym and into the far corner. The keeper might have done better. A preview of one of tomorrow\u2019s big games Burnley 1-0 Peterborough Pym makes a good save from Gudmundsson\u2019s low shot. Peterborough could be blown away here. A question for both you readers: what\u2019s your favourite FA Cup third round goal and why? I\u2019m not sure I can get past Ronnie Radford. Rodriguez gives Burnley the lead from close range after Chris Wood\u2019s header is saved by Christy Pym. He was offside in the build up, but it was a new phase of play by the time he scored, which meant the goal survived a VAR check. Incidentally, VAR is only being used in matches at Premier League grounds. Millwall take an early lead with Matt Smith scoring from 10 yards after a left-wing corner was allowed too bounce across the box. Birmingham have scored the first goal of the third round. Daniel Crowley, once of Arsenal, surges from the halfway line to the edge of the box and cracks a low shot into the far corner. Good goal, that. Burnley and Newcastle, the two Premier League sides playing this lunchtime, have both picked strong XIs. It will be hard for any of the Small 13 to win the competition, but there is certainly scope for a run to the semi-finals, perhaps the final. \u201cOne of the reasons I subscribed to ESPN+ was so I could watch FA Cup matches here in the USA,\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cLittle did I expect they would ALL be available. What do I do?\u201d Watch Rochdale v Newcastle, and keep pressing F5 on this clockwatch so that we get more hits and The Man labours under the misapprehension that I am more popular than the average Clockwatcher. He might even give me a packet of bonbons. The 12.31pm games are about to kick off. A reminder that Scott Murray is following Rochdale v Newcastle. \u201cHappy new year!\u201d says Mike MacKenzie. \u201cNot sure how practical the following ideas are but offer them anyway to improve FA Cup: 1) No replays from 3rd round on. I think Jamie Carragher has suggested this among others. Would result in more upsets as well as fewer games. 2) Move winter break to January. Have it start after the 3rd round FA Cup weekend. That might encourage teams to play their best sides knowing they\u2019ll get a rest after.\u201d I like the first idea in particular, but the climate has changed so much that I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way to restore the FA Cup\u2019s 20th-century status. Actually, there is one way: football could buy back its soul. But there is more chance of me waking up tomorrow morning with a lustrous mullet. As with 99.9999 per cent of everything Scott Murray writes, this is a brilliant read And here\u2019s a preview of every third round match Peterborough think they will be facing a shadow Burnley side when they turn up for an early kick-off at Turf Moor, and they might be right. The FA Cup has come at an awkward time for the Clarets, who have lost six of their last eight league games, are only four points above the relegation zone and face Chelsea, Leicester, Manchester United and Arsenal when the Premier League resumes. Sean Dyche will still try to pick a side capable of winning the tie against League One\u2019s top scorers, but anything could happen. VAR will be in use here, as it will be at all ties hosted by Premier League teams. Some pre-match reading Hello. These all-dayers are getting out of hand. It was the Premier League on New Year\u2019s Day, and today it\u2019s an FA Cup third round special. First orders will be at 12.31pm, when the opening round of matches kick off. There are more games at 3.01pm, then a third lot starting at 5.31pm. We\u2019ll have separate MBMs for the two televised games, Rochdale v Newcastle and Wolves v Man Utd while muggins here will attempt to keep up with all the other games. The unusual kick-off times, as you are probably aware, are so that we can take a minute or three to think about mental health. Football has come a long way in the 21 years since Stan Collymore was made a pariah. Alas, the FA Cup has become a bit of an outcast in that time, certainly in comparison to the big Leagues. We\u2019re all friends here, so let us speak frankly: the FA Cup third round does not have the magic/romance/insert preferred cliche here it once did. It will never mean as much as it did in the days of Ronnie Radford, Matthew Hanlan and Micky Thomas. (The saddest thing about the FA Cup, since you asked, is that its greatest day, 8 April 1990, hastened its demise.) It is still English football\u2019s greatest giantkilling canvas, though, and the likelihood is that, at some stage this weekend, a few players will define their careers. Maybe even their lives.

      "bodyText": "There is an old Iranian proverb: \u201cYou don\u2019t put the wooden pot on the fire twice.\u201d Someone needs to tell that to Donald Trump, who risks plunging the US into its fifth disastrous conflict in two decades \u2013 after Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria \u2013 with no more clue than his predecessors about the consequences, the cost, the aftermath or the exit strategy. I shed no tears over the death of General Qassem Suleimani, a man of violence whose legacy is written in the blood of innocent civilians. But make no mistake, the Trump administration\u2019s decision to assassinate him, and breach Iraq\u2019s sovereignty to do so, was a wilful attempt to push Iran to the edge of a war that would put millions more lives at risk. As with everything else Trump has done with regard to Iran since coming to office, starting with his sabotage of Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear deal, his latest act has simply served to strengthen the grip of the hardline theocratic and military wing of the Iranian regime, who have bitterly resented attempts made in recent years to build better relationships with the west. Whether this strategy has been deliberate or simply perverse does not matter. The hardliners are now firmly back in control, and their only reaction to Suleimani\u2019s assassination will be to escalate the tension they crave still further, and retaliate on a greater scale. This is no longer tit for tat; it is classic brinkmanship, and when neither side can afford to lose face with their domestic audience or international counterparts, we can only fear the outcome. Let\u2019s remind ourselves that Iran is almost four times the size of Iraq, five times the size of Vietnam and nine times the size of Syria, with a population of 83 million and the 10th-biggest army in the world. And while the armchair generals think that another round of \u201cshock and awe\u201d will overcome that, they still have absolutely no plan for what will follow, or for how a postwar Iran would function \u2013 just as they had no plan for Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya or Syria. So we face a central question here in Britain. Do we repeat the experience of those other conflicts, and get dragged into this quagmire by Trump, or do we have the courage that Harold Wilson showed during the Vietnam war, and refuse to join whatever coalition he cobbles together if the conflict continues to escalate? I have seen some politicians describe this as a choice about whose side Labour is on: the US or Iran. To which my answer is, I\u2019m on Britain\u2019s side. And I would never put our brave British servicemen and women in harm\u2019s way to fight a war that would risk unimaginable suffering for the civilian population of Iran, and unforgivable losses for our own forces. Patriotism is not jingoism. And, for me, being patriotic means thinking about the families left behind \u2013 and all too often left bereaved \u2013 when their loved ones are sent away to fight wars we should have no part of, and that have nothing to do with the defence of our country, but everything to do with the crazed belligerence of foreign leaders. Having shadowed Boris Johnson for the two years he was foreign secretary, I have no confidence that he will make the right decision on this issue. It is astonishing to me that, in more than 48 hours since the assassination, he has not made any statement about a crisis that is on the brink of becoming an even more destructive and catastrophic war than Iraq or Syria. Is he afraid of angering Trump? Or is it simply that, as he lounges in the Caribbean sun, he simply does not care, an exact duplicate of the blase approach to Iran that he took in 2018 \u2013 when he was foreign secretary and Trump was driving the nuclear deal to destruction \u2013 and the previous year when he recklessly jeopardised the fate of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? Whoever becomes Labour\u2019s new leader, they need to have the strength, experience and knowledge to lead parliament in fighting back against Britain becoming embroiled in this disastrous drift to war. Otherwise, the wooden pot will soon burn again. Emily Thornberry is the shadow foreign secretary",

Mike Birbiglia\u2019s Sleepwalk with Me, about his fear of marriage, was first a show, then a Netflix special. \u201cHas your girlfriend heard the jokes?\u201d his on-screen character is asked. \u201cYou should probably mention it.\u201d On a similar tack, there\u2019s James Acaster\u2019s Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999, about his girlfriend leaving him for Rowan Atkinson, which took out top prize at Melbourne international comedy festival this year. Luke Leonard pushed boundaries in his show Man Up, about his brother who did 13 years for murder; Sam Simmons\u2019s Spaghetti for Breakfast drew on his mother\u2019s unconventional parenting and won both an Edinburgh comedy award and a Barry; Maria Bamford filmed The Special Special Special for Netflix, about her early life and mental illness, in front of an audience of two \u2013 her parents (\u201con some level, everything I do is for my parents anyway,\u201d she told the Los Angeles Times). Greg Fleet has used the fake disappearance of his father to much effect and, while we\u2019re here, Bob Franklin created a knuckle-biting MICF show, Yours Sincerely, in which he unfavourably depicted someone with a startling resemblance to his former friend, Fleety. The writing-what-you-know conundrum is not limited to comedians. A musician friend of mine is devastated at his family\u2019s reaction to a song on his new album about growing up amid domestic violence. Another friend fears their transitioning is about to become the theme of an ex\u2019s academic essays. A writer pal got a custom T-shirt for Christmas from her father with the words \u201cCareful or you\u2019ll end up in my novel\u201d. My own father, after I published a memoir, emailed me to muse that he was thinking about writing one himself. It sounded like a threat. \u2022 Seasons one and two of The Other Guy are available to stream now on Stan",

For the past month, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/jan/04/australia-nsw-fires-live-updates-victoria-bushfires-rfs-cfa-road-closures-near-sydney-melbourne-latest-news\" title=\"\">country had been ablaze</a>, and the village 240 miles south of Sydney and home to 776 people, had been hit hard.</p> <p>Standing in the crowd, Zoey Salucci McDermott, 20, eyed Scott Morrison coolly. She and her young daughter had lost her home in the fires, so when he extended his hand in greeting, she did not reciprocate. \u201cI\u2019ll only shake your hand if you give more funding to the RFS [Rural Fire Service],\u201d McDermott said, holding back tears. \u201cSo many people here have lost their homes. We need more help.\u201d The prime minister turned away.</p> <p>Days before, two separate firefronts had swept across much of southern NSW and eastern Victoria with unprecedented ferocity, wiping entire towns from the map. When the flames arrived in Cobargo, they tore through the main street, roaring like the ocean, incinerating lives and livelihoods.</p> <p>Robert Salway, 63, and his son Patrick, 29, died when they stayed behind to defend their property. Patrick\u2019s wife, Renee, who is pregnant with the couple\u2019s second child, found their bodies.</p> <p>As the flames retreated, a white hot anger smouldered. \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome, you fuckwit,\u201d a man yelled after Morrison as he retreated under a barrage of insults. Referring to the affluent Sydney suburb where the prime minister has an official residence, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t see Kirribilli burning after the fireworks.\u201d</p> <p>The scene, caught on video, has become symbolic of a nation at odds with its leadership as it has endured a week of horror in a rolling, months-long national emergency that has yet to reach its climax.</p> <p>The scale of the destruction is hard to overstate. When the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/aug/27/amazon-rainforest-fires-an-environmental-catastrophe-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Amazon rainforest caught </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/aug/27/amazon-rainforest-fires-an-environmental-catastrophe-in-pictures\" title=\"\">fire</a> last January, 906,000 hectares burned. And last July, 2.6 million hectares were turned to ash across the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/29/countries-from-siberia-to-australia-are-burning-the-age-of-fire-is-the-bleakest-warning-yet\" title=\"\">Siberian steppe</a>.</p> <p>Since the first fires began in Australia in August, more than 5 million hectares have been set aflame, fanned by unusual weather patterns and lower-than-usual humidity that has allowed firefronts to spread rapidly across a bone-dry landscape. The country\u2019s volunteer firefighting forces are exhausted, outgunned and overwhelmed.</p> <p>The fires are behaving in unpredictable ways, spreading at night and even returning to areas that have already burned. Conditions on the ground have seen walls of flame, spot fires coalescing into fire tornados and some firefronts burning so hot they have formed their own weather systems. The ensuing lightning strikes have gone on to ignite yet more fires.</p> <p>The direct death toll stands at 23, with more expected. Some species have been pushed to extinction, and more than half a billion animals are estimated to have been killed. Farmers have reported running out of bullets as they work to end the suffering of half-dead livestock.</p> <p>Of all the states, New South Wales has been hardest-hit, with 3.41 million hectares scorched over the past few months and Sydney, at one point, finding itself encircled by active firezones. Around the same time, fire ripped through the Adelaide Hills and Kangaroo Island in the central state of South Australia. In the <a href=\"https://www.winespectator.com/articles/australian-wildfires-scorch-vines-in-adelaide-hills\" title=\"\">Adelaide Hills</a> in South Australia, flames swallowed 25,000 hectares of prime agricultural land, leaving a third of the wine industry in the area \u201csmashed\u201d.</p> <p>The state of Victoria in the southeast, meanwhile, greeted the first week of the new decade in horror as it watched new firefronts bloom in East Gippsland before quickly building into an inferno which blackened 700,000 hectares in days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7485b6cdf2cdeeb2a710e258d7c137645b9eae8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7485b6cdf2cdeeb2a710e258d7c137645b9eae8c/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison, the prime minister, turns away from Zoey Salucci McDermott on his Cobargo visit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison, the prime minister, turns away from Zoey Salucci McDermott on his Cobargo visit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wherever the fires rise, their approach has been foreshadowed by falling ash and the dimming of light as blue skies turn either nicotine yellow, glowing orange or, in some cases, blood red. That was the scene in Mallacoota, a tourist town 260 miles east of Melbourne in the middle of a Unesco biosphere. As the rest of the world readied to bid goodbye to 2019, locals spent their New Year\u2019s Eve watching the flames approach.</p> <p>Residents woke to find skies blackened by ash and temperatures rising to 49C at 8am.

      "bodyText": "The sky over Cobargo in New South Wales was still tainted yellow on Thursday afternoon when Australia\u2019s prime minister arrived. For the past month, the country had been ablaze, and the village 240 miles south of Sydney and home to 776 people, had been hit hard. Standing in the crowd, Zoey Salucci McDermott, 20, eyed Scott Morrison coolly. She and her young daughter had lost her home in the fires, so when he extended his hand in greeting, she did not reciprocate. \u201cI\u2019ll only shake your hand if you give more funding to the RFS [Rural Fire Service],\u201d McDermott said, holding back tears. \u201cSo many people here have lost their homes. We need more help.\u201d The prime minister turned away. Days before, two separate firefronts had swept across much of southern NSW and eastern Victoria with unprecedented ferocity, wiping entire towns from the map. When the flames arrived in Cobargo, they tore through the main street, roaring like the ocean, incinerating lives and livelihoods. Robert Salway, 63, and his son Patrick, 29, died when they stayed behind to defend their property. Patrick\u2019s wife, Renee, who is pregnant with the couple\u2019s second child, found their bodies. As the flames retreated, a white hot anger smouldered. \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome, you fuckwit,\u201d a man yelled after Morrison as he retreated under a barrage of insults. Referring to the affluent Sydney suburb where the prime minister has an official residence, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t see Kirribilli burning after the fireworks.\u201d The scene, caught on video, has become symbolic of a nation at odds with its leadership as it has endured a week of horror in a rolling, months-long national emergency that has yet to reach its climax. The scale of the destruction is hard to overstate. When the Amazon rainforest caught fire last January, 906,000 hectares burned. And last July, 2.6 million hectares were turned to ash across the Siberian steppe. Since the first fires began in Australia in August, more than 5 million hectares have been set aflame, fanned by unusual weather patterns and lower-than-usual humidity that has allowed firefronts to spread rapidly across a bone-dry landscape. The country\u2019s volunteer firefighting forces are exhausted, outgunned and overwhelmed. The fires are behaving in unpredictable ways, spreading at night and even returning to areas that have already burned. Conditions on the ground have seen walls of flame, spot fires coalescing into fire tornados and some firefronts burning so hot they have formed their own weather systems. The ensuing lightning strikes have gone on to ignite yet more fires. The direct death toll stands at 23, with more expected. Some species have been pushed to extinction, and more than half a billion animals are estimated to have been killed. Farmers have reported running out of bullets as they work to end the suffering of half-dead livestock. Of all the states, New South Wales has been hardest-hit, with 3.41 million hectares scorched over the past few months and Sydney, at one point, finding itself encircled by active firezones. Around the same time, fire ripped through the Adelaide Hills and Kangaroo Island in the central state of South Australia. In the Adelaide Hills in South Australia, flames swallowed 25,000 hectares of prime agricultural land, leaving a third of the wine industry in the area \u201csmashed\u201d. The state of Victoria in the southeast, meanwhile, greeted the first week of the new decade in horror as it watched new firefronts bloom in East Gippsland before quickly building into an inferno which blackened 700,000 hectares in days. Wherever the fires rise, their approach has been foreshadowed by falling ash and the dimming of light as blue skies turn either nicotine yellow, glowing orange or, in some cases, blood red. That was the scene in Mallacoota, a tourist town 260 miles east of Melbourne in the middle of a Unesco biosphere. As the rest of the world readied to bid goodbye to 2019, locals spent their New Year\u2019s Eve watching the flames approach. Residents woke to find skies blackened by ash and temperatures rising to 49C at 8am. As daybreak turned to night, the sky grew red as the flames drew near. With the only road out of town soon cut off by fire, 4,000 people were forced to flee towards the beach. When traffic backed up, people abandoned their cars. Soon after, the emergency services ordered people to wade into the sea to escape the blaze. Over the next two days, as images of the destruction began to emerge on social media, an evacuation order was given for some 14,000 sq kms between Nowra in New South Wales and the border of Victoria. Across the state lines, Victorian state premier Daniel Andrews declared an official state of disaster in Gippsland on Thursday night, enacting sweeping powers that have never been used. Weeks after an advertising campaign began in the UK to attract tourists to Australia, tens of thousands of holidaymakers were evacuated from coastal NSW and Victoria, the largest peacetime evacuation in the country\u2019s history, with the navy deploying to rescue those trapped in Mallacoota. Authorities in those states which have so far escaped the devastation have been left to watch on nervously. Peak fire season typically hits with the height of summer, leaving those states so far unaffected to wait their turn \u2013 with far fewer resources. With bushfires flaring so early in the year, volunteers have been sequestered from across the country to assist on the east coast.

Speaking at the UN in New York last September he insisted Australia would meet its emissions reductions targets \u201cin a canter\u201d. That same month, his government was being warned about the catastrophic fire risk presented by climate change. Former New South Wales fire chief Greg Mullins and 22 other former emergency services chiefs wrote to Morrison outlining the potential crisis and asking for more specialised equipment to deal with hotter and longer bushfire periods. They were ignored. Emergency services have been asking for resources since 2016, when the National Aerial Firefighting Centre asked for a \u201cnational large air-tanker fleet\u201d to support firefighting operations but were rebuffed. The consistent refusal to stump up the cash or even engage with a chorus of experts warning about a crisis has defined the conservative government\u2019s policy since it took power under Tony Abbott in 2013. Now, as the country faces one of the worst natural disasters in its history, a short-term, transactional austerity politics has collided with the long arc of climate change in a way that is clearly visible on the ground. Firefighters in some areas have been forced to crowdfund for basic equipment while until recently the federal government remained steadfast in its refusal to back-pay volunteers for their time, even as the prime minister praised their \u201cspirit\u201d. It took sustained public pressure to drag the government to compensate volunteers, with Morrison announcing last Saturday that they would receive up to $6,000.

And so, we\u2019ve got to argue against war, argue for peace, argue for conflict resolution, and argue in our ever more dangerous world that what we really need is to avoid the rush to war.\u201d",

It\u2019s highly probable that there are even more of these \u201cnon-decent\u201d abodes, not least because many tenants are too frightened to complain about poor conditions, rent rises or appalling behaviour by landlords. To do so risks eviction. Labour has called the fund \u201cpuny\u201d and \u201ca drop in the ocean\u201d compared to council cuts since 2010. These cuts limit their power to act, allow landlords to do as they like and have long been cited as a major reason why the private rental sector has morphed into a housing wild west. Even private landlords think\u00a34m is too little to tackle the rogues who give them a bad name. The government knows all this. It knows occasional cash splurges can\u2019t begin to solve the problems of exploitative rental tenancies. So, why send out the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, to announce this shredded fig leaf right at the start of the year \u2013 were they hoping that people would still be too hazy from the festivities to realise that their intelligence is being insulted? Come on, Leavers \u2013 you won so please stop gloating What is it about Tory Leaver types that make them such bad winners? I wondered whether to bother reacting to Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201clet\u2019s be friends\u201d New Year\u2019s Day message. Such brazen trolling of Remainer/non-Tory voters requires scant translation, but here goes: \u201cDark Overlord II here (we all know that the Domster is Dark Overlord I). Sure, I caused most of the Brexit aggro, but now let the country come together (to forgive me). As friends and equals (well, sort of \u2013 there is a limit). Let\u2019s forget the unpleasantness (caused by me) and let me (ME!) proceed unhindered, without your loser carping ruining the optics for my World King gig. PS: oops, almost forgot \u2013 Get Brexit Done.\u201d This is what I mean about bad winners. It\u2019s not enough for them to win, they must gloat, preen, gush with smirking faux-magnanimity, use an olive branch to poke and goad, return to the scene of the crime to give the body another kick. As I so often think, regarding Johnson and Cummings, what would a good, responsible parent do? Perhaps it\u2019s best to stop rewarding bad behaviour with attention \u2013 don\u2019t get angry, which is just playing straight into their hands. We must pity them, poor things, for their lack of grace, their evident inability to cope with getting everything they ever wanted. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

His most recent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/26/shadowplay-joseph-oconnor-review\" title=\"\"><em>Shadowplay</em></a>, won novel of the year at the <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/culture/2019/1018/1084192-shortlist-announced-for-irish-book-awards-2019/\" title=\"\">Irish Book awards for 2019</a> and is also on the shortlist for the Costa novel award (the winner will be announced later this month). He is currently adapting the book for film.</p> <p><strong>Congratulations on being shortlisted</strong><strong>. How does it feel?</strong><br>I would love to tell you that I\u2019m totally cool about it and it doesn\u2019t matter at all. And in some ways, prizes don\u2019t matter, and they mustn\u2019t, and we must be grown up about writing and keep our eye on the work. But the problem is the prize nomination comes along and it brings out your inner Gollum. And suddenly you go: I want it, I would love to have that glittery thing. And so it\u2019s a lovely affirmation, but also it\u2019s an illusion.</p> <p><strong>How did you become a writer?</strong><br>When I was a kid, in the 70s in Dublin, there wasn\u2019t any literary culture in terms of festivals or readings or writers\u2019 groups. There was nothing at all; it was a very silent place. But there\u2019s just more and more now. The Irish are great readers: if you look at our bestsellers lists, week after week, you see serious, sometimes difficult books, vying with the typical bestsellers there in the top 10. It\u2019s genuinely a part of the culture. And the publishing scene here has changed in such a radical way. When I was a kid, your only option really was to go to London and try and be published there.</p> <p><strong>So it didn\u2019t immediately seem a welcoming environment\u2026</strong><br>When I say there wasn\u2019t any literary culture, I suppose what I mean is that the ghosts of Irish writing were around. There were statues of Joyce and Yeats, and Yeats\u2019s face was on the 10 punt note. And even though the books weren\u2019t really read, there was some kind of sense that the only Irish people who had ever achieved anything were great writers, and that they were figures of reverence, and they stood around your childhood like prehistoric ruins.</p> <p><strong>So if you were going to join them, you had to be really good\u2026</strong><br>You\u2019d have to have something new to say. You\u2019d have to have your windmills to tilt at. That was the other wonderful thing about growing up with the legacy of the pantheon of Irish writers: you could always point out what they had got wrong or what in their work was now irrelevant. It\u2019s one of the great things about Roddy Doyle\u2019s debut novel, <em>The Commitments</em>, that it\u2019s set not in the city or in the countryside, the two great places of Irish literature, but in the suburbs, and people are not listening to colleens playing harps. It was useful to have that; it gives the Irish writing of around that time, from people like Roddy Doyle and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/04/fiction\" title=\"\">Dermot Bolger</a>, a sort of punk energy.</p> <p><strong>And you persevered\u2026</strong><br>One of the things that happened to me as a kid in terms of my writing life was there was a John McGahern story that I really loved called Sierra Leone, in a book called <a href=\"https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571225682-getting-through.html\" title=\"\"><em>Getting Through</em></a>. It was published in the late 70s and there was a copy in the house. I was 14 or 15 then and I was messing around with the idea of writing, and I had nothing to write about. Nothing had ever happened to me. And one night, in desperate frustration with nothing to write about, I just wrote it out. I just wrote out that short story word by word in a copybook. A couple of nights later, I did it again and I changed a bit of the punctuation, and a couple of nights later I did it again and I changed the characters\u2019 names and they became the names of people I knew and neighbours up the road.</p> <p><strong>What happened in the end?</strong><br>Over the course of a couple of years, at some point the balance tilted and it became mine. And this once beautiful McGahern short story, I took the bulldozer of teenage writerly ambition to it and destroyed it. But somewhere in the ashes is my story. I once had the chance to tell the great McGahern, to make my confession to him, and he looked at me very gravely and said: I think you owe me a pint.</p> <p><strong><em>Shadowplay</em> centres on Bram Stoker, author of <em>Dracula</em>, and his relationship with the actor-manager Henry Irving and actor Ellen Terry. How did it take root?</strong><br>Bram has been with me my whole life, for such a long time that I sometimes don\u2019t quite remember how he came to me first. But it\u2019s something to do with my late maternal grandmother, who was from the Liberties, the oldest part of the city of Dublin, and was a great storyteller.<br> The most fascinating story she used to tell was about an ancestor of her own, a young man who had been around in Victorian Dublin. He was a lamplighter, and one night he had been on his rounds in Church Street, on the north quays of the Liffey, and there is St Michael\u2019s church there, where there are bodies preserved in the crypt. He notices this well-dressed, prosperous young man standing outside the church and looking up at the steeple. It\u2019s a very poor neighbourhood and he\u2019s thinking this man is lost, so he goes over and the man says he\u2019s not lost. He\u2019s interested in the story of the bodies in the crypt. And they get chatting and it turns out that he\u2019s Bram Stoker. Well, I loved the notion, even though I suspected it was made up, that a relative of mine might have met the great man. I first heard it when I was about five or six. I last heard it in my teens and it was exaggerated each time; by the end it was practically that Bram Stoker had been round to the house for tea.</p> <p><strong>Stoker\u2019s Dracula has never been out of print and, as we know, the gothic novel has recently enjoyed a resurgence. Why do you think that is?</strong><br>Count Dracula\u2019s probably got a case for being the most filmed fictional character in history. But the big opponent would be Sherlock Holmes. And from exactly the same era; in fact, Stoker and Conan Doyle were good mates. It\u2019s really interesting that these are the two central figures, because Victorian fiction is full of evil twins: Jekyll and Hyde and <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>. But, in fact, Dracula and Sherlock Holmes are kind of evil twins too. Because the notion of Sherlock Holmes is that everything can be solved. All we need is logic. All we need is intelligence and that English, Victorian ability to measure things and apply focus. There is no mystery so inscrutable that it can\u2019t be solved, which we really admire about the books, but we know that\u2019s not true. We know that from our own lives. We know that every day of the week there are things about other people, things about ourselves that we find so strange and that we will never understand and that\u2019s why we have the gothic ...I think when Sherlock Holmes looks in the mirror, it\u2019s Count Dracula staring back at him.</p> <p><strong>What did you enjoy reading as you were growing up?</strong><br>The writers I loved when I was a kid were Americans. I loved John Steinbeck and Ernest Hemingway, and the first time I read JD Salinger\u2019s <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, that was probably the book that made me want to be a writer. And then just discovering someone like Toni Morrison. I remember when <em>Beloved</em> came out \u2013 I was in my late 20s \u2013 and being besotted with it. I still am. The things she\u2019s able to achieve in her writing in terms of musicality and feeling, as well as storytelling.

He also said he wanted universities to remain properly funded, warning against lowering tuition fees. \u201cI think that would do grave damage to our institutions\u2019 financial stability and, also, I think it would be very bad politics as well but that is rather beside the point,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to continue to fund our universities successfully and build on our research excellence and I think that\u2019s the priority for the government.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if there would be a significant impact if fees were lowered by a third, he replied: \u201cYes, there would be a substantial impact, particularly if that funding were not made up by the Treasury which, given the current politics, I would have grave doubts that it would be. The priority, where there is discretionary income within the Department of Education, is to put it towards schools and to put it towards further and technological education. We need to level up, rather than level down, university funding to create some sort of false parity.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI think where there clearly are grounds for concerns about universities are, as the sector has expanded, has quality been maintained? Are there issues around degree inflation? Are there issues around unconditional offers? Which are legitimate areas for criticism and for reform but I think to be vindictive and to be, sort of, punitive about universities because they were on the wrong side of a perceived culture war over Brexit, I think that\u2019s completely the wrong way to go if we want to make a success of global Britain and our future post-Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson also defended universities after Sir Robbie Gibb, Theresa May\u2019s former director of communications, laid into the the Today programme\u2019s election coverage in a <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7850595/SIR-ROBBIE-GIBB-BBC-wake-bias-Radio-4s-Today-show.html\">comment piece for the Daily Mail</a>. In a scathing piece, Gibb said the programme had \u201cmisread the politics of the election with endless outside broadcasts in universities, full of interviews with left-wing, entitled, virtue-signalling students\u201d.</p> <p>Responding, Johnson said: \u201cOur universities are clearly a great national asset and if we want to make a success of Brexit projects like global Britain, we need our universities to play a very big part in that. We need to be championing them and getting behind them and making the most of them. That means funding them properly and it means we don\u2019t run down institutions like our universities and denigrate their cultures.\u201d</p>",

He also said he wanted universities to remain properly funded, warning against lowering tuition fees. \u201cI think that would do grave damage to our institutions\u2019 financial stability and, also, I think it would be very bad politics as well but that is rather beside the point,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to continue to fund our universities successfully and build on our research excellence and I think that\u2019s the priority for the government.\u201d Asked if there would be a significant impact if fees were lowered by a third, he replied: \u201cYes, there would be a substantial impact, particularly if that funding were not made up by the Treasury which, given the current politics, I would have grave doubts that it would be. The priority, where there is discretionary income within the Department of Education, is to put it towards schools and to put it towards further and technological education. We need to level up, rather than level down, university funding to create some sort of false parity.\u201d He added: \u201cI think where there clearly are grounds for concerns about universities are, as the sector has expanded, has quality been maintained? Are there issues around degree inflation? Are there issues around unconditional offers? Which are legitimate areas for criticism and for reform but I think to be vindictive and to be, sort of, punitive about universities because they were on the wrong side of a perceived culture war over Brexit, I think that\u2019s completely the wrong way to go if we want to make a success of global Britain and our future post-Brexit.\u201d Johnson also defended universities after Sir Robbie Gibb, Theresa May\u2019s former director of communications, laid into the the Today programme\u2019s election coverage in a comment piece for the Daily Mail. In a scathing piece, Gibb said the programme had \u201cmisread the politics of the election with endless outside broadcasts in universities, full of interviews with left-wing, entitled, virtue-signalling students\u201d. Responding, Johnson said: \u201cOur universities are clearly a great national asset and if we want to make a success of Brexit projects like global Britain, we need our universities to play a very big part in that. We need to be championing them and getting behind them and making the most of them. That means funding them properly and it means we don\u2019t run down institutions like our universities and denigrate their cultures.\u201d",

In the final minutes there was still time for Pereyra to be sent off, Watford to put a dangerous free-kick just over the bar and Tranmere to once more cause havoc in the Watford box. But a draw was the final score and Prenton Park awaits. Would the replay be an unwelcome distraction from league matters, Mellon was asked. \u201cIt won\u2019t be an unnecessary distraction to the bank manager.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Harry Arter had not scored since November 2017 and nor, by any measure, had he been a roaring success since joining Fulham on loan from Bournemouth in August. The impression has been one of a career in decline and when he replaced Kevin McDonald in the 72nd minute for his first appearance since a calf injury in mid-October there was little expectation he might avert the outcome nobody wanted.</p> <p>Within 120 seconds Arter, receiving Stefan Johansen\u2019s square pass 25 yards out, took a touch and beat Orjan Nyland all ends up with a scorching, dipping left-footer that may not be bettered all weekend. It ensured a goal of similar merit by Anthony Knockaert, cancelled out by Anwar El Ghazi, was not in vain and handed Fulham the minor scalp of Aston Villa in a tie that improved immeasurably after an awful opening period.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/04/rochdale-newcastle-united-fa-cup-match-report\">Rochdale veteran Aaron Wilbraham takes Newcastle to FA Cup replay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBoth goals were pretty special,\u201d said the Fulham manager, Scott Parker, before settling on Arter\u2019s as his slight favourite.</p> <p>Arter happens to be his brother-in-law, but it was a fair call: the shot had found the one spot Villa\u2019s keeper had no chance of reaching and may also have the longer-term effect of kick-starting the midfielder back into form.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big shame he had a bit of a setback with injury, but he\u2019s a character and we all understand the player we\u2019ve got,\u201d said Parker, who also added that Bournemouth have no option to recall Arter this month. \u201cIt\u2019s moments like this, for Harry and the team, that you need to build on and get a bit of a lift.\u201d</p> <p>Parker now hopes Arter can help wrench Fulham back out of the Championship. They had succeeded in a similar quest the last time these clubs met, winning the play-off final in May 2018, and although their respective fortunes have made 180 degree turns since then it is perfectly feasible that they may switch places again in four months\u2019 time. That possibility was at the front of both managers\u2019 minds, Parker making six changes from Fulham\u2019s previous league outing and the Aston Villa manager, Dean Smith, nine, and the result was a game whose general level of quality was wildly at odds with the goals that settled it.</p> <p>Knockaert\u2019s strike, nine minutes into the second half, came as a blessed relief. There had barely been a chance to speak of until Marek Rodak saved from an unmarked El Ghazi just before half-time; almost anything that occurred after the restart would constitute an improvement and Knockaert, a loan signing from Brighton and another player whose stint at Fulham had yet to ignite, quickly delivered.</p> <p>He had already arrowed a shot just wide when the ball reached him on the right touchline with open grass to exploit. Marvelous Nakamba\u2019s presence required him to check inside and, moving away from goal, seek a shooting angle a few yards outside the D. His effort flew across Nyland and prompted Parker to wonder whether he, too, might be clicking at the right time.</p> <p>\u201cWe brought him in and he\u2019s got off to a slowish start,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the last three games you\u2019ve seen the Knockaert we\u2019re more familiar with.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/04/wolves-v-manchester-united-fa-cup-live\">Wolves v Manchester United: FA Cup third round \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given the visitors\u2019 hectic schedule, the next instalment of which is a League Cup semi-final first leg at Leicester on Wednesday, it was fair to wonder what kind of Villa we would see after they went behind. A replay was at the bottom of their wishlist but they did rally and El Ghazi equalised after Jonathan Kodjia, capitalising on a missed clearance by Michael Hector, knocked the ball past Rodak.</p> <p>It looked as if Villa might effect a complete turnaround but Arter then unleashed his thunderbolt. Smith was keen to highlight the poverty of the overall spectacle and his lack of apology for fielding a second-string side came with a measure of regret.</p> <p>\u201cFor whatever reason it\u2019s lost its sparkle and it wasn\u2019t top of our priorities,\u201d he said of the FA Cup.</p> <p>There is an element of chicken-and-egg about that attitude but, on a week when Villa lost Tom Heaton and Wesley to long-term injuries, he could be forgiven for feeling distracted. Fulham, for their part, hope this win has recharged two key players for the season\u2019s business end.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Harry Arter had not scored since November 2017 and nor, by any measure, had he been a roaring success since joining Fulham on loan from Bournemouth in August. The impression has been one of a career in decline and when he replaced Kevin McDonald in the 72nd minute for his first appearance since a calf injury in mid-October there was little expectation he might avert the outcome nobody wanted. Within 120 seconds Arter, receiving Stefan Johansen\u2019s square pass 25 yards out, took a touch and beat Orjan Nyland all ends up with a scorching, dipping left-footer that may not be bettered all weekend. It ensured a goal of similar merit by Anthony Knockaert, cancelled out by Anwar El Ghazi, was not in vain and handed Fulham the minor scalp of Aston Villa in a tie that improved immeasurably after an awful opening period. \u201cBoth goals were pretty special,\u201d said the Fulham manager, Scott Parker, before settling on Arter\u2019s as his slight favourite. Arter happens to be his brother-in-law, but it was a fair call: the shot had found the one spot Villa\u2019s keeper had no chance of reaching and may also have the longer-term effect of kick-starting the midfielder back into form. \u201cIt\u2019s a big shame he had a bit of a setback with injury, but he\u2019s a character and we all understand the player we\u2019ve got,\u201d said Parker, who also added that Bournemouth have no option to recall Arter this month. \u201cIt\u2019s moments like this, for Harry and the team, that you need to build on and get a bit of a lift.\u201d Parker now hopes Arter can help wrench Fulham back out of the Championship. They had succeeded in a similar quest the last time these clubs met, winning the play-off final in May 2018, and although their respective fortunes have made 180 degree turns since then it is perfectly feasible that they may switch places again in four months\u2019 time. That possibility was at the front of both managers\u2019 minds, Parker making six changes from Fulham\u2019s previous league outing and the Aston Villa manager, Dean Smith, nine, and the result was a game whose general level of quality was wildly at odds with the goals that settled it. Knockaert\u2019s strike, nine minutes into the second half, came as a blessed relief. There had barely been a chance to speak of until Marek Rodak saved from an unmarked El Ghazi just before half-time; almost anything that occurred after the restart would constitute an improvement and Knockaert, a loan signing from Brighton and another player whose stint at Fulham had yet to ignite, quickly delivered. He had already arrowed a shot just wide when the ball reached him on the right touchline with open grass to exploit. Marvelous Nakamba\u2019s presence required him to check inside and, moving away from goal, seek a shooting angle a few yards outside the D. His effort flew across Nyland and prompted Parker to wonder whether he, too, might be clicking at the right time. \u201cWe brought him in and he\u2019s got off to a slowish start,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the last three games you\u2019ve seen the Knockaert we\u2019re more familiar with.\u201d Given the visitors\u2019 hectic schedule, the next instalment of which is a League Cup semi-final first leg at Leicester on Wednesday, it was fair to wonder what kind of Villa we would see after they went behind. A replay was at the bottom of their wishlist but they did rally and El Ghazi equalised after Jonathan Kodjia, capitalising on a missed clearance by Michael Hector, knocked the ball past Rodak. It looked as if Villa might effect a complete turnaround but Arter then unleashed his thunderbolt. Smith was keen to highlight the poverty of the overall spectacle and his lack of apology for fielding a second-string side came with a measure of regret. \u201cFor whatever reason it\u2019s lost its sparkle and it wasn\u2019t top of our priorities,\u201d he said of the FA Cup. There is an element of chicken-and-egg about that attitude but, on a week when Villa lost Tom Heaton and Wesley to long-term injuries, he could be forgiven for feeling distracted. Fulham, for their part, hope this win has recharged two key players for the season\u2019s business end.",

      "body": "<p>On New Year\u2019s Day, the Pope veered off script during his address to a packed St Peter\u2019s Square to apologise for his behaviour the previous night. Unsurprisingly, this did not involve the traditional end-of-December misdemeanour of drinking excessively and vomiting on a host\u2019s sofa. Instead, while greeting pilgrims at the Vatican on Tuesday evening, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/jan/01/indignant-pope-francis-slaps-womans-hand-to-free-himself-at-new-years-eve-gathering-video\" title=\"\">slapped a woman\u2019s hand</a> away after she grabbed him and yanked him towards her. He may have labelled the slap a \u201cbad example\u201d but, appropriately for a spiritual leader, the apology itself provided an immaculate blueprint for saying sorry.</p> <p>Why was it so laudable? First, it came swiftly. Less than 24 hours after the incident. There was no whiff of hoping the fuss (inevitably, the slap had <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/pope-francis-slapping-bodyguards-security-new-year-eve-12228906\" title=\"\">sparked criticism</a> on social media) would blow over, nor of waiting for advisers to conjure a glib, legally watertight statement. Second, it was unequivocal. \u201cSo many times we lose patience \u2013 even me, and I apologise for yesterday\u2019s bad example,\u201d were his words in full. They contained no attempt to excuse or diminish the wrongdoing. He merely acknowledged his human fallibility, which may have chimed with those who have recently watched Netflix\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/01/the-two-popes-review-anthony-hopkins-jonathan-pryce-netflix\" title=\"\">The Two Popes</a></em>: the show offers an unsentimental portrait of how, in becoming pontiff, one is expected to have miraculously morphed from flawed human to spotless martyr.</p> <p>Of course, it may sound odd to look to the leader of the Catholic church for tips in contrition \u2013 Francis has been criticised for not tackling the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/21/pope-francis-truth-sexual-abuse-summit\" title=\"\"> sexual abuse crisis</a> more decisively. He\u2019s perhaps more than adept at addressing his own personal faults than those of the institution he represents.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WySwhj2SwE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3WySwhj2SwE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Pope Francis slaps a woman\u2019s hand to free himself on New Year\u2019s Eve.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>A proper apology from an adult human shouldn\u2019t be remarkable. It\u2019s something you\u2019re expected to have mastered around the time you graduate from reception. In an alarming indictment of our education system, however, it seems hordes of people get through school without a basic grasp of how apologies work. While we\u2019re discussing the best and worst trends of the last decade, I\u2019ll venture that the 2010s were the exasperating era of the non-apology. The age in which the \u201cI\u2019m sorry if\u2026\u201d format rose to prominence, letting the wrongdoer off the hook by implying the victim had mistakenly detected offence in what was clearly an innocent act. You know, kitten slaughter, or something like that: \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you were offended that I murdered little Ginger. That was not my intention.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, this sort of skulduggery creates an (often false) distinction between acts and intentions, leading to some of the most blatant examples of gaslighting imaginable as the guilty try to claim they didn\u2019t mean any offence by the flagrantly offensive thing they\u2019ve done.</p> <p>But this isn\u2019t the only variety of poor apology. Public figures have valiantly toiled in recent years to demonstrate a wide array of rubbish attempts at saying sorry. For instance, there\u2019s also the colossal understatement apology, as showcased by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/17/prince-andrew-abuse-emily-maitlis-queen\" title=\"\">Prince Andrew in his unforgivable interview</a> with Emily Maitlis in November about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein\" title=\"\">Jeffrey Epstein</a>; the only regret he admitted to having about his friendship with the convicted sex offender was the fact Epstein had, in the prince\u2019s indefensibly mild words, \u201cconducted himself in a manner unbecoming\u201d.</p> <p>Another example is the apology that takes so long to arrive it means nothing by the time it\u2019s uttered, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/corbyn-resists-calls-to-apologies-to-british-jews-after-rabbis-claims\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s agonising failure</a> during the election campaign to apologise over antisemitism in the Labour party. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/what-the-papers-say-about-jeremy-corbyns-interview-with-andrew-neil\" title=\"\">He declined four times</a> to do it during an interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil and it was finally squeezed out of him in the seediest of ways: he had to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/03/corbyn-apologises-for-antisemitism-in-labour-party\" title=\"\">begged by Phillip Schofield </a>on live television. Elsewhere, there\u2019s that craven phrase \u201cI misspoke\u201d, which is deployed time and again to pass off lies, ignorance or saying something offensive as a mere slip of the tongue.</p> <p>In the face of such evasion, it\u2019s tempting to think public figures aren\u2019t truly sorry for what they\u2019ve done, but just feign regret to wriggle out of trouble. But seeing as we\u2019re at the start of a new year, a more optimistic stance seems necessary. If the 2010s were a string of crap sorries, here\u2019s hoping the pope has set the precedent for a new decade where public apologies are heartfelt, not laughably hollow.</p>",

Unsurprisingly, this did not involve the traditional end-of-December misdemeanour of drinking excessively and vomiting on a host\u2019s sofa. Instead, while greeting pilgrims at the Vatican on Tuesday evening, he slapped a woman\u2019s hand away after she grabbed him and yanked him towards her. He may have labelled the slap a \u201cbad example\u201d but, appropriately for a spiritual leader, the apology itself provided an immaculate blueprint for saying sorry. Why was it so laudable? First, it came swiftly. Less than 24 hours after the incident. There was no whiff of hoping the fuss (inevitably, the slap had sparked criticism on social media) would blow over, nor of waiting for advisers to conjure a glib, legally watertight statement. Second, it was unequivocal. \u201cSo many times we lose patience \u2013 even me, and I apologise for yesterday\u2019s bad example,\u201d were his words in full. They contained no attempt to excuse or diminish the wrongdoing. He merely acknowledged his human fallibility, which may have chimed with those who have recently watched Netflix\u2019s The Two Popes: the show offers an unsentimental portrait of how, in becoming pontiff, one is expected to have miraculously morphed from flawed human to spotless martyr. Of course, it may sound odd to look to the leader of the Catholic church for tips in contrition \u2013 Francis has been criticised for not tackling the sexual abuse crisis more decisively. He\u2019s perhaps more than adept at addressing his own personal faults than those of the institution he represents. A proper apology from an adult human shouldn\u2019t be remarkable. It\u2019s something you\u2019re expected to have mastered around the time you graduate from reception. In an alarming indictment of our education system, however, it seems hordes of people get through school without a basic grasp of how apologies work. While we\u2019re discussing the best and worst trends of the last decade, I\u2019ll venture that the 2010s were the exasperating era of the non-apology. The age in which the \u201cI\u2019m sorry if\u2026\u201d format rose to prominence, letting the wrongdoer off the hook by implying the victim had mistakenly detected offence in what was clearly an innocent act. You know, kitten slaughter, or something like that: \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you were offended that I murdered little Ginger. That was not my intention.\u201d Indeed, this sort of skulduggery creates an (often false) distinction between acts and intentions, leading to some of the most blatant examples of gaslighting imaginable as the guilty try to claim they didn\u2019t mean any offence by the flagrantly offensive thing they\u2019ve done. But this isn\u2019t the only variety of poor apology. Public figures have valiantly toiled in recent years to demonstrate a wide array of rubbish attempts at saying sorry. For instance, there\u2019s also the colossal understatement apology, as showcased by Prince Andrew in his unforgivable interview with Emily Maitlis in November about Jeffrey Epstein; the only regret he admitted to having about his friendship with the convicted sex offender was the fact Epstein had, in the prince\u2019s indefensibly mild words, \u201cconducted himself in a manner unbecoming\u201d. Another example is the apology that takes so long to arrive it means nothing by the time it\u2019s uttered, such as Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s agonising failure during the election campaign to apologise over antisemitism in the Labour party. He declined four times to do it during an interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil and it was finally squeezed out of him in the seediest of ways: he had to be begged by Phillip Schofield on live television. Elsewhere, there\u2019s that craven phrase \u201cI misspoke\u201d, which is deployed time and again to pass off lies, ignorance or saying something offensive as a mere slip of the tongue. In the face of such evasion, it\u2019s tempting to think public figures aren\u2019t truly sorry for what they\u2019ve done, but just feign regret to wriggle out of trouble. But seeing as we\u2019re at the start of a new year, a more optimistic stance seems necessary. If the 2010s were a string of crap sorries, here\u2019s hoping the pope has set the precedent for a new decade where public apologies are heartfelt, not laughably hollow.",

The release of documents began on New Year\u2019s Day on an anonymous Twitter account, @HindsightFiles, with links to material on elections in Malaysia, Kenya and Brazil. The documents were revealed to have come from Brittany Kaiser, an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower, and to be the same ones subpoenaed by Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Kaiser, who starred in the Oscar-shortlisted Netflix documentary The Great Hack, decided to go public after last month\u2019s election in Britain. \u201cIt\u2019s so abundantly clear our electoral systems are wide open to abuse,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very fearful about what is going to happen in the US election later this year, and I think one of the few ways of protecting ourselves is to get as much information out there as possible.\u201d The documents were retrieved from her email accounts and hard drives, and though she handed over some material to parliament in April 2018, she said there were thousands and thousands more pages which showed a \u201cbreadth and depth of the work\u201d that went \u201cway beyond what people think they know about \u2018the Cambridge Analytica scandal\u2019\u201d. Steele made a rare public intervention to comment on the leaks. He said that while he didn\u2019t know what was in them, the context couldn\u2019t be more important because \u201con our current trajectory these problems are likely to get worse, not better, and with crucial 2020 elections in America and elsewhere approaching, this is a very scary prospect. Something radical needs to be done about it, and fast.\u201d He said authorities in the west had failed to punish those practising social and other media manipulation, and \u201cthe result will be that while CA may have been exposed and eventually shut down, other, even more sophisticated actors will have been emboldened to interfere in our elections and sow social divisions\u201d. Kaiser said the Facebook data scandal was part of a much bigger global operation that worked with governments, intelligence agencies, commercial companies and political campaigns to manipulate and influence people, and that raised huge national security implications. The unpublished documents contain material that suggests the firm was working for a political party in Ukraine in 2017 even while under investigation as part of Mueller\u2019s inquiry and emails that Kaiser says describe how the firm helped develop a \u201csophisticated infrastructure of shell companies that were designed to funnel dark money into politics\u201d. \u201cThere are emails between these major Trump donors discussing ways of obscuring the source of their donations through a series of different financial vehicles. These documents expose the entire dark money machinery behind US politics.\u201d The same machinery, she says, was deployed in other countries that Cambridge Analytica worked in, including, she claims, Britain. Emma Briant, an academic at Bard College, New York, who specialises in investigating propaganda and has had access to some of the documents for research, said that what had been revealed was \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d. \u201cThe documents reveal a much clearer idea of what actually happened in the 2016 US presidential election, which has a huge bearing on what will happen in 2020. It\u2019s the same people involved who we know are building on these same techniques,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence of really quite disturbing experiments on American voters, manipulating them with fear-based messaging, targeting the most vulnerable, that seems to be continuing. This is an entire global industry that\u2019s out of control but what this does is lay out what was happening with this one company.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump are among Republican voters\u2019 top picks for the GOP presidential nomination in 2024, according to a new poll. Forty percent of respondents to the survey by news site Axios and Survey Monkey wanted the vice-president, Mike Pence, to be the Republican nominee in 2024, whether to succeed Donald Trump in the Oval Office or to take on a Democratic incumbent if this year\u2019s race is lost. Twenty-six percent wanted Nikki Haley, formerly governor of South Carolina and ambassador to the United Nations under Trump. But 29% plumped for Donald Trump Jr, a regular surrogate for his father despite nominally being separated from the political side of the family by joint control, with his brother Eric, of the Trump Organization. Ivanka Trump, with her husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser in the White House, was supported by 16%. Donald Trump Jr recently published a political book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us. It was a New York Times bestseller, if surrounded by questions about Republican efforts to help it, and the tour to promote it attracted sizable crowds, if not uniformly adoring. Reviewing the book for the Guardian, Lloyd Green said it was \u201ca better campaign biography than most\u201d and was \u201cbest viewed as the opening salvo of the Trump child with real political chops\u201d. The president\u2019s oldest child, Green wrote, \u201ctruly connects with the party\u2019s base\u201d and \u201chis convention speech [in 2016] warranted the attention it received\u201d. \u201cBottom line, come 2024 Don Jr could well be on the ticket.\u201d Like her father before 2016 and her brother now, Ivanka Trump has never held elected office. But she has been reported to have political aspirations. In his blockbuster White House expos\u00e9 Fire and Fury, for example, the journalist Michael Wolff said she and Kushner had made a deal: \u201cThe first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton: it would be Ivanka Trump.\u201d Often portrayed as a liberal and restraining influence on her father, Ivanka Trump has claimed success over paid family leave for federal workers and federal sentencing reform. She has also represented her father on the world stage, to widespread criticism and occasional apparent mockery from actual international leaders. The Axios/Survey Monkey poll noted that younger Republican voters tended to back the Trump children while older respondents favoured Pence and other national figures. Other leading Republicans who scored respectably included the Florida senator Marco Rubio (15%), US secretary of state Mike Pompeo (13%) and Texas governor Greg Abbott (13%). Pompeo seems headed for the Senate in Kansas, a prelude to an expected White House run. Rubio has run for the nomination before, in 2016, when he was briefly seen as a leading contender before Trump blew him out of the water. Many observers now think the Trump takeover of the party of Lincoln makes a family succession more likely than not. Speaking to the Los Angeles Times last month, the Republican strategist and Trump critic Rick Wilson said: \u201cI honestly think Don Jr or Ivanka will be the nominee in 2024 \u2026 because the party doesn\u2019t care about any of the issues that used to drive the party. Now they care about Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t think the party has any shot at recovering from Trump,\u201d Wilson added. \u201cI think someday there will again be a centre-right economic and individual liberty conservative party again.

      "bodyText": "An amateur side from R\u00e9union have caused a major shock in the Coupe de France by beating Ligue 2 side Niort away from home in the round of 64. It turned out to be a very worthwhile 9,000km journey for JS Saint-Pierroise from the island situated off the coast of Madagascar as G\u00e9rard Hubert and Ryan Ponti scored in a 2-1 defeat of the second tier side. The French Football Federation allow teams from the overseas departments to take part in the competition each season but it is only the second time in history a team from one of the islands have reached the last 32 of the cup. The last time it happened was in 1989 when Le Geldar of French Guiana achieved the same feat. Veteran Hubert opened the scoring with a header but that was cancelled out by his teammate Mamy Randrianarisoa who put the ball into his own net. The Islanders bounced back as Ponti put them back into the lead and they managed to hold on. At the final whistle, the team celebrated with fans as a number of flares. Match-winner Ponti said: \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t realise what we just did. What we are doing is historic.

He just capped off a 39-county bus tour of western Iowa in a camper.</p> <p>Scholten said voters in rural areas like Sac City and Rockwell City are easier to organize than in Democratic metro strongholds such as Des Moines or Iowa City. Those who show up in Rockwell City are reliably Democratic and less issue-focused. Rarely do they see a candidate with Klobuchar\u2019s resume. When they do, they leave with a strong impression.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to get viability in Sac county than Polk county,\u201d said Scholten. \u201cShe recognizes that people are familiar with her. Sac City isn\u2019t a long way from the Iowa-Minnesota border.\u201d</p> <p>Those who hear Klobuchar\u2019s message like her focus on the midwest.

      "bodyText": "Craig Hiller, an Iowa farmer, had just enjoyed a hot chocolate on Amy Klobuchar\u2019s campaign bus as it made a stop in the small town of Rockwell City, population just 2,100. Hiller, whose state is the vital first one to cast ballots in the party\u2019s nomination race to pick an opponent to Donald Trump, was impressed by the Minnesota senator, a fellow midwesterner who desperately needs a strong showing in Iowa to boost her 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cWho we need is someone who someone who\u2019s down to earth, who no one can hate,\u201d Hiller said on Rockwell City\u2019s Main Street as Klobuchar\u2019s bus rolled to its next stop in Cherokee county, 50 miles west. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone after tonight who fits that better than Amy Klobuchar.\u201d That sort of reaction is music to Klobuchar\u2019s ears as she carried out a gruelling tour through 27 counties in rural Iowa in an attempt to build a groundswell of support through reaching out to the state\u2019s smallest towns and rural settlements. With this strategy, even a couple dozen attendees counts as a success. On her arrival in Rockwell \u2013 with temperatures below freezing \u2013 25 people including Hiller had piled aboard the big green Amy bus for hot chocolate. Two dozen others had turned out to see the Minnesota senator in tiny Ida Grove that same day, a county that doesn\u2019t even have 1,000 registered Democrats. But most striking to Klobuchar was a crowd of around 50 packing the Sac County Cattle Company on a Sunday night just before Christmas. It\u2019s where the Republican congressman Steve King, who hails from Kiron, 30 miles south, stumps and dines with family. The proprietor said Klobuchar\u2019s crowds were at least the size of King\u2019s, or any other Republican who has come calling. Klobuchar said those gatherings are a sign of what to expect on Iowa\u2019s caucus day on 3 February. Klobuchar sits at about 6% support among probable Iowa caucusgoers, according to the most recent Des Moines Register Iowa poll in October, but a strong debate showing in Los Angeles brought her notice. She says it\u2019s evidence of momentum, just like the folks coming out to see her in increasing numbers. \u201cWe\u2019re approaching this like we can win, and all signs are pointing in the right direction,\u201d Klobuchar told the Guardian. \u201cA crowd that size in Sac City, anywhere in rural America, means something. I\u2019m especially glad it\u2019s in Steve King\u2019s backyard.\u201d Klobuchar is blunt about her shared background with Iowa\u2019s voters. She brags about being from the midwest, and how she can win in rural Minnesota counties that Trump took by 20 points. In the last Democratic debate she took a dig at the location of a rival\u2019s fundraiser by saying she\u2019s never been to a wine cave, but she\u2019s been to a wind cave in South Dakota. A mention of Trump is usually followed with a mention of the tanking of corn and soybean prices from trade wars. Her entire argument is built around electability in midwest swing states such as Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan and Ohio. \u201cHe\u2019s treating farmers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos,\u201d she said to the delight of her audience at one stop. By contrast, she says she remembers her neighbors saving spare cash in coffee cans growing up. The question is whether her momentum, which is mainly confined to Iowa, is too little too late. In less than six weeks, caucusgoers will trudge through a frigid night to precinct meetings in schoolhouses and courthouses \u2013 while she may be chained to Trump\u2019s impeachment trial in the US Senate, which is set to start sometime in January and last for an unknown time. \u201cTo say it\u2019s an uphill battle would definitely be accurate, even charitable,\u201d said Brad Best, a longtime caucus observer and political science professor at Buena Vista University in Storm Lake. \u201cIn an ironic way, her stardom in the Senate will hurt her campaigning in Iowa, where she desperately needs to do well.\u201d Yet, there are precedents. John Kerry came from the shadows in 2004 less than two weeks before the caucuses to win, and later secure the nomination. Klobuchar says a doubling of office spaces in Iowa and positive responses in Des Moines Register/CNN Iowa polls are signs of hope. Best says her strongest advantage is that overwhelming majorities of probable caucusgoers have favorable opinions of her and list her in their top three selections. \u201cI\u2019d say I know Iowans pretty well, and they really like honesty, which is what we aren\u2019t seeing from the man in the White House,\u201d Klobuchar said, citing the 39 counties in Iowa that voted for Trump in 2016 and Barack Obama in 2008. She says people there have a thirst for economic prosperity that can be achieved realistically, not with promises like Medicare for All. She never mentions challengers from the progressive wing by name. \u201cWe can win them back telling the truth. We can bring those people back.\u201d Congressional candidate JD Scholten, a Sioux City Democrat running against King, likes Klobuchar\u2019s strategy of dwelling on rural voters. He just capped off a 39-county bus tour of western Iowa in a camper. Scholten said voters in rural areas like Sac City and Rockwell City are easier to organize than in Democratic metro strongholds such as Des Moines or Iowa City. Those who show up in Rockwell City are reliably Democratic and less issue-focused. Rarely do they see a candidate with Klobuchar\u2019s resume. When they do, they leave with a strong impression. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to get viability in Sac county than Polk county,\u201d said Scholten. \u201cShe recognizes that people are familiar with her. Sac City isn\u2019t a long way from the Iowa-Minnesota border.\u201d Those who hear Klobuchar\u2019s message like her focus on the midwest. After the Sac City event, one farmer \u2013 who declined to offer his name because his landlord is Republican \u2013 said Klobuchar\u2019s retelling of family stories from the iron ore mines and farms of northern Minnesota struck him as authentic. \u201cIt\u2019s not a story she picked up from somewhere. It\u2019s one you can tell she\u2019s from here, she\u2019s one of us who faces the same problems we do,\u201d he said.",

I think it was the Australians who introduced individual players\u2019 numbers, based on where they were in the list of representing the country at Test level, and which they displayed on the baggy green. It was a good idea as it strengthened morale, as well as helping to identify players. Later, these numbers appeared on shirts/jumpers. England followed their lead. It seems a pity this wasn\u2019t done world-wide because it solves the problems of allocating numbers, rather than a new set of rules, which cricket authorities appear to be really keen on, perhaps as a means of them leaving a legacy.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e108c8e8f085eda5c11208a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T13:03:22.788Z\">1.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>49th over: South Africa 134-3 (Elgar 71, van der Dussen 46) </strong>Just three easy runs off Joe Root, who hasn\u2019t yet lured Elgar or VDD into the mistakes he might have hoped for. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e108b2f8f085eda5c112079\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T13:00:45.275Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>48th over: South Africa 131-3 (Elgar 70, van der Dussen 44) </strong>The deficit is now down to 138, and tight as Anderson is bowling, England could do with a breakthrough before tea. </p> <p>Thank you to <strong>Andrew Gladwin </strong>for this:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/surfermoon/status/1213441529542565888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tjaldred?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tjaldred</a> Hi Tanya Cape Town is ok after almost running out of water two years ago but some parts of South Africa still in serious drought regards Andrew Gladwin</p>&mdash; Andrew Gladwin (@surfermoon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/surfermoon/status/1213441529542565888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 4, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>I remember the day zero threats in Cape Town, I think they cancelled all youth cricket that year?

However, he has turned out to be a huge cricket geek underneath his tattoo-complemented self. In India, his delivery of statements as skipper about supporting the longest format of the sport has immensely helped in the sale of Test cricket as a concept.

I\u2019ve been banging away about this for nearly four years now. WE HAD A TRIAL in 2016, where the TV umpire watched the front line in an ODI series between England and Pakistan, and it WORKED A TREAT! The ICC told me then that it would be rolled out everywhere. But, nothing happened. In 2018, they told me it was... too expensive. Too expensive to use cameras that are already there? Odd. The good news is that they have realised the error in this and are going to roll out some more trials in the first half of this year. My conspiracy theory is that the TV umpire isn\u2019t interested in watching the front line on a TV screen all day (toggling back and forth, alerting the central umpire when there is an overstep). It further bolsters the case for specialist TV umpires, if you ask me. Take the job away entirely from the elite panel officials and develop a new generation of umpires who understand the technology intimately.

First, how excited is everyone about the Test Championship. A little bit, but that\u2019s it, even amongst us tragics. And I suspect the players even less so - how keen are they on an extra match on test fees rather than silly IPL type money.

Has to be cash I think, and proper amounts.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019ll have to agree to disagree here. The players are <em>very</em> into the WTC - those I\u2019ve talked to about it, anyway. They\u2019ve wanted this league for a long time. The problem with the WTC is the weird points allocation but they will surely fix that for the next cycle with some sort of balancing mechanism. It\u2019s fairly ridiculous that Pakistan are third on the table with one win from four Tests. If I was King? I\u2019d draw from the Women\u2019s championship where <em>three</em> matches from each series count and they ensure a minimum of three Tests are played in each. No more two-Test flings!

Instead, in an age when Test matches have a points system for world ranking, simply deduct one point for every session\u2019s over rate failure with umpires allowing some discretion for slow play owing to bad weather and unforeseen events. If this means some sides end up with a minus figure, so what? It ought to mean more spin bowling, which is a Good Thing.\u201d</p> <p>Yep, that\u2019s definitely the way to do it. Use the points, not the cash. <br></p> <p>Ian Forth has an alternative view: \u201cI don\u2019t really get the furore concerning over rates,\u201d he says. \u201cThere seems moral outrage that spectators are being \u2018short changed\u2019. But how many spectators actually watch an entire day\u2019s test cricket anyway? At most matches I\u2019ve been to the ground\u2019s half empty at the start of play, two thirds empty at the start of the other sessions and often half empty at stumps. Compared to problems like four day tests, uneven contests, match fixing and so on, over rates only become a real problem in matches such as Port of Spain in 1990 or Karachi in 2000 where a team deliberately slows the game right down to avoid defeat.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d spin that to why shouldn\u2019t they get the correct number of overs in? They do in county cricket. They do in Sheffield Shield cricket. The women always hit their targets when playing Test cricket. Why do the men get a leave pass? <br></p> <p>Back to scrapping the fifth day. \u201cAlternatively, is there something to be said for having the ultimately disappointing result come after just 4 days of futile hope, rather than 5?\u201d asks Matt Dony. I feel like we don\u2019t get many bore draws these days, though? If a Test is going the distance, usually at least one team can win it late. But I\u2019m going on gut feel there, which is always a bit dicey. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1070ab8f085eda5c111fe2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T11:06:36.122Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u201cWhere do you stand on the pitch (as t\u2019were)?\u201d asks my man Gary Naylor. </strong>\u201cThis time yesterday, most pundits were telling us that it was a belter, when it clearly wasn\u2019t - have they changed their tune?

So is our beloved game a welcome distraction or soothing balm during these troubled times? As a child I was rather troubled by the prospect of the earth being engulfed by a solar fireball within four or five billion years - my hasn\u2019t the time flown by.

But why would they bother? I saw a prominent Australian footballer post Richard Flanagan\u2019s powerful piece on the New York Times about the Australian fires and then had a look at the replies to his tweet. Why subject yourself to that if you already have a fairly big megaphone as a celebrity sportsperson? Not to say I wish more wouldn\u2019t consider it.

Hate the idea like all good people. Seems to me that any time one side gets a good first innings lead (say 100+) the team batting third will play for a draw, probably from the start of day 3, sometimes from the end of day 2. But... they are going to happen aren\u2019t they, like wifi and pop music. Seems to me that rather than having this endless, pointless debate about whether its good, we need to loom at how to make it work. The main problem will be over rates. Let\u2019s keep it simple. Each session a certain number. Every over short the captain loses 25% of their match fee. Third umpire has a stop watch to check for added time (5 mins an over) so the captain can appeal at the end of the match, but only then. If captains want to play for free, they are welcome.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe they figure with the WTC giving such a high reward for wins (especially in two/three match series) that we won\u2019t see teams play for draws?

There\u2019s no batswing required there - all timing. Those feel really good. Broad, around the wicket, immediately drags his length back and has the left-hander leaving close to his off-stump. The over gets very expensive at the end though, Broad\u2019s angle cutting Elgar in half and also beating Buttler, running away for four byes. Unlucky. But to finish he\u2019s again too full, as he was to begin the over, so the left-hander takes full advantage through the cover region on this occasion. They\u2019re off to a flyer.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re a bit self selecting here, enthusiasts who follow OBO at any and all hours but reducing the days makes no sense to me in that... at 5, it\u2019s a very different game,\u201d is the very reasonable assessment of Peter Gibbs. \u201c4 days promotes more sloggery and perhaps a narrower range of abilities and we have plenty of that in its\u2019 purest form at the other end of the scale. 5 days is a different game, not better or worse. 4 days is reductive.\u201d </p> <p>To quote Derek Pringle on twitter yesterday on that same line: \u201cOver the centuries Test cricket has evolved into the highest form of the game to be played over five days. Lopping a day off to secure its survival is like removing one horn from a black rhino to make it less attractive to poachers... barmy.\u201d<strong><br></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GeoffLemonSport/status/1213380989549858818\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sunset at the SCG.

Pieter Malan\u2019s turn, the 30-year-old playing his debut Test innings here. The Newlands crowd know their cricket and give him a solid round of applause when the new right-hander defends the first ball from the middle of his bat. They\u2019re even happier when he gets off the mark from the final ball of the over with a lovely cut shot, putting it away past the vacant point region. A classy way to get out of the blocks. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe question to ask here is - will the four-day format benefit cricket?\u201d asks Abhijato Sensarma on our topic of four-day Tests. \u201cThere will be more aggressive batting from the batsmen, and lesser importance or time given to defence. This may lead to an erosion of technique as well as the spirit of the purest form of the game we hold so dear. Excessively defensive bowling is likely become a feature too. Of course, one cannot deny this will increase the format\u2019s commercial viability at a time the format is being neglected financially. The players will benefit if the \u2018trickle down effect\u2019 is to be believed. It is not. Also, another argument put forward about giving players breathing space in their workload is not convincing - more LOIs will probably be fitted in during this period of vacancy by the ever-greedy administrators.

I can\u2019t help feeling they\u2019re fiddling while Rome burns. The far more obvious answer to test cricket\u2019s problems in attracting crowds is switching to the day-night test, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m with you on the second point. We now have a dependable pink ball, so let\u2019s use it more often if that\u2019s what it takes. I\u2019m also in favour of throwing a pink ball out there to stop players coming off for bad light if floodlights are available. Just until the close, that is. Then back to the red one when they resume the next day. </p> <p>Here\u2019s that final wicket. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SkyCricket/status/1213381872182595584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ENGLAND 2\u20e36\u20e39\u20e3 ALL OUT!<br><br>Jimmy Anderson the last man to fall, edging Rabada to slip, as England add seven to their overnight score \ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f<br><br>\ud83d\udcfa Watch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SAvENG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SAvENG</a> reaction: <a href=\"https://t.co/hz1tBgPwNC\">https://t.co/hz1tBgPwNC</a><br>\ud83d\udcf1 Live blog: <a href=\"https://t.co/BOaN9IKkfX\">https://t.co/BOaN9IKkfX</a><br>\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram: <a href=\"https://t.co/mhh84s2Sjg\">https://t.co/mhh84s2Sjg</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/fL8UQjJ9Fy\">pic.twitter.com/fL8UQjJ9Fy</a></p>&mdash; Sky Sports Cricket (@SkyCricket) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyCricket/status/1213381872182595584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 4, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1050338f085eda5c111f46\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T08:47:59.365Z\">8.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ENGLAND ALL-OUT 269! WICKET! Anderson c van der Dussen b Rabada 4.</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Anderson steers Rabada into the hands of van der Dussen at first slip, ending this tenth wicket stand at 35. He was down there after a misjudgment from Pope from the first ball of the over, digging a yorker out to midwicket and calling two but there was never two there. But he did really well, walking off unbeaten on 61.<strong><br></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e104eaa8f085eda5c111f40\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T08:43:28.431Z\">8.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>91st over: England 268-9 (Pope 60, Anderson 4) </strong>Nortje has the pace to keep Pope quiet as they continue the strike-milking game. He doesn\u2019t take the singles to cover and can\u2019t make contact with the short stuff when it eventually arrives at the tail end of the over. He does get a run for the tally, via a bouncer that is called as a wide by Paul Reiffel for leaping too high. The touring supporters are loving that. He rebowls the final ball and the Surrey man makes room to bunt a length delivery over mid-off for the single they crave to keep him on strike. That\u2019s the way. <br></p> <p>\u201cI agree that I think it is a done deal to make 4 day test cricket,\u201d says Damian Horton. \u201cI expect the main reason is it makes financial sense to drop day 5 (nothing to do with players!!). Day 5 often has the full expense of staff, food, security etc but often doesn\u2019t have the revenue due to refunds for no play or discounted/free tickets and tickets only sold on the day (hard to plan for). 4 day tests would be more profitable in Aus and England but more critically the only way to make financial sense in other countries.\u201d</p> <p>My short response is that four-day Tests probably have their place. But to mandate them for the World Test Championship is a whole other thing. I get why New Zealand are keen on them, for example, given how infrequently they get to play. Indeed, take Bangladesh too who have been showed so little respect from Cricket Australia - not hosted for a Test since 2003 - maybe a pair of four-day fixtrues would get that over the line. Not that such bad behaviour should be rewarded. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e104db28f085eda5c111f3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T08:36:54.211Z\">8.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90th over: England 266-9 (Pope 59, Anderson 4)</strong> Very good from Jimmy, getting the first ball of the day safely down to third man to give the strike to Pope. The young man makes solid contact with a drive to the man at cover to begin before flicking two confident runs through midwicket. Rabada goes short to Pope in response, who gets underneath it. To finish, he gets resourceful with a snuffle outside the leg stump to open up the offside, eventually hacking a quick single to square leg to keep the strike for the next over. They\u2019ve managed that really well. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e104d318f085eda5c111f3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T08:32:43.730Z\">8.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The players are on the field at Newlands. </strong>Right, how long can this final England pair drag it out?

Just typing that venue name still gives me a mild cast of PTSD: the last time I was there I was commentating when Cam Bancroft shoved a square of sandpaper down his pants. But I digress. <br></p> <p>In Cape Town, you get one of the hardest and best tracks in the world to bat on. It\u2019s why Vic Marks said last night that the opening day was the type to make England\u2019s bowlers very cross. With the exception of Zak Crawley, all of England\u2019s specialist batsmen got into the game and reached at least 29, yet none made it beyond 47 with the exception of Ollie Pope, who resumes today on 56 with the visitors 262-9.</p> <p>It was a familiar tale, those wasted starts. The look on Ben Stokes\u2019 face said it all when he gave catching practice to cover after batting like a dream until three runs short of a half-century. They\u2019re now well behind the game and relying on the old firm of Anderson and Broad - along with a supporting cast of Curran, Stokes and Dom Bess (much more on him later) to get them out of jail on this second day. </p> <p>Before that, the hosts, excellent with the ball again yesterday - aren\u2019t they always? - have to end this frustrating tenth wicket stand, currently worth 28 between Pope and Jimmy Anderson. The former took to ramping by the close last night, such was his confidence. What they would give for even half an hour of additional, productive resistance this morning. We\u2019ll find out soon.

      "bodyText": "Nasser: \u201cEngland were absolutely superb all day, well led by Joe Root. It\u2019s not a minefield of a pitch but Broad and Anderson got the game by the scruff of its neck and then Sam Curran who was a bit innocuous in the middle session,... got stuck in , well backed up by Dom Bess.\u201d Sam Curran says it is easier to breathe here than it was at Centurion at altitude. I wasn\u2019t aware it was an issue, so that\u2019s kind of interesting. A real comeback-kid kind of day for Root\u2019s team, buoyed up by mass England support at Newlands. It leaves the Test in tantalising cloth for tomorrow morning. Thanks for all the emails and tweets - play starts tomorrow at 8.30 GMT - the forecast is slightly cooler, but dry. I\u2019ll leave the final words to Avitaj Mitra: Lots of adjectives might describe this England team (some not fit for a newspaper) but boring is not one of them. They really have Out-Pakistaned Pakistan. Day 3 is set to be a cracker, which might accurately describe the state of the pitch as well. A good night to all fellow OBO lovers! Anderson\u2019s shadow is short and squat, but he remains tall and elegant, not even a strand of grey hair, at least from a few thousand miles away. He also has all his old magic, far too good for Maharaj, who lunges blindly, two balls short of stumps. What a day for England - they fought and fought, they were patient, and after a disappointing post-lunch session, a drop, a wicket off a no ball, they got their teeth into the South African late middle-order. A two-noise wicket: Maharaj nudges ball on to pad, then it loops up in the air to Sibley scampering in at third slip. What sensational bowling there by Anderson with the new ball at the death. How about figures of 3-34 to put your feet up to? And, as yesterday, nine wickets have fallen in the day. 84th over: South Africa 214-7 ( Philander 12, Maharaj 4) What a ball from Broad. From wide of the the crease, the ball bounces short and inwards, forcing a kind of clockwork jerk from Maharaj. He survives the over, and there is one left in the day. 83rd over: South Africa 214-7 ( Philander 12, Maharaj 4) Anderson has decided to perform a masterclass in bowling with the new ball. His first falls on a perfect length and whistles past Philander\u2019s bat. His sixth nips in and misses the top of off-stump by a quaver\u2019s curl. In between Philander drives deftly for three.. Damian Ainsworth is scratching an itch: \u2018Root perseveres with Curran, I might have been tempted to switch to Broad or Anderson straight away now he\u2019s done his job\u2019 Just wondering if anyone on OBO is contractually allowed to give Joe Root credit for anything\u2026just wondering... Delighted to admit that Joe Root proved me completely wrong! He\u2019s handled his bowlers most adeptly since tea, and they\u2019ve performed for him too. Which is half the battle. 82nd over: South Africa 210-7 ( Philander 9, Maharaj 1) Broad gets his turn with the new nut. Maharaj leans into a drive past cover for a couple and survives the over. This innings is starting to look like a carbon copy of England\u2019s. South Africa still trail by 59. Patrick Ford has been doing a bit of list-ticking at Newlands: As there\u2019s very little else to do at Newlands, other than consume Castle later at R35/pint, we decided to spot current Premier League football shirts in attendance. We\u2019re missing only Sheffield United, Crystal Palace, and, surprisingly, Spurs. Please urge any of these people to report to the Railway Stand. 81st over: South Africa 208-7 ( Philander 9, Maharaj 1) Not a bad little over to warm the dying embers of the day. A drop off Anderson\u2019s very first ball with the new ball, redemption four balls later. Ben Stokes - balls of steel. Three balls after dropping the same batsmen in the same position; Stokes scoops up a mind-blowing catch at second slip with his right hand with a force that knocks him off his feet. And the new ball does its work! 80th over: South Africa 207-6 ( Philander 9, Pretorius 4) Curran varies his length, and Philander nudges jerkily at him; the ball falls just short of the man with the magnetic hands, Ben Stokes, at second slip. A maiden. And that might spell the end of Curran\u2019s work for the day too. THE NEW BALL IS TAKEN. 79th over: South Africa 207-6 ( Philander 9, Pretorius 4) The final ball of Bess\u2019s spell dips a little short and Pretorius pulls him with gumption, and top-edge, for four. And that\u2019s the end of a very good day\u2019s work for Dom Bess: 27-3-62-1. Vic will be most pleased. 78th over: South Africa 202-6 ( Philander 7, Pretorius 0) Curran\u2019s shadow runs with him, perpendicular to the pitch as he scurries by. Philander steals a single and just two overs left with this old ball, which has done alright for England this afternoon. Hmmmm, muses Mark Slater on Sam Curran, Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t be such a partnership breaker if batsman thought he was not a soft touch? More fool them! 77th over: South Africa 201-6 ( Philander 7, Pretorius 0) Bess wheels into his 26th over as South Africa start their rebuilding scheme. 76th over: South Africa 200-6 ( Philander 6 ) Turns out I definitely shouldn\u2019t be England captain. Curran makes a second breakthrough in three overs and England are nudging on top. Curran comes from round the wicket, the ball shapes away, VDD tries to glide it down and Stokes takes another stunner, low to the ground, both hands, balletically gorgeous. 75th over: South Africa 198-5 ( Philander 5, van der Dussen 67) More steadiness from Bess who is doing all that Root asks right now. Just one from it. And something to throw into the missing no-ball debate. Though wasn\u2019t it ever thus with the hip? 74th over: South Africa 197-5 ( Philander 5, van der Dussen 66) Root perseveres with Curran, I might have been tempted to switch to Broad or Anderson straight away now he\u2019s done his job. Just a couple from the over, South Africa trail by 72 and could do with putting a turbo-boost into their batting before the new ball arrives in six overs. What did I say about those Phds? Jim Todd writes: At the risk of seeming pedantic, Brian Poole is missing the point. Kim Thonger said \u201cSince I started to watch Test cricket seriously, when Brian Close was captain from 1967 onwards\u201d which indicates that 1967 is the year she (he?) started to watch Test cricket. Brian Close was captain at that time, but he (she?) does not say when he started to be captain. I must admit I came to Test cricket a little later, but Brian Close was still god-like at that time. 73rd over: South Africa 194-5 ( Philander 3, van der Dussen 65) Philander gets off the mark with a drive off Bess. 72nd over: South Africa 192-5 ( Philander 1, van der Dussen 65) Classic Sam Curran, who had a difficult time after lunch. A terrier, he never gives up, his ears ever pricked, his tail always waggy. And, still, despite knowing he\u2019s such an effective partnership breaker, batsmen see him as easy pickings. Now, can England get stuck in for the final charge? Curran does it again! England\u2019s ultimate throw-him-on-and-watch-him-fizz bowler. With his second ball after coming into the attack, he goes slow and wide and de Kock licks his lips... and sends a leading edge flying to Jimmy Anderson. 71st over: South Africa 190-4 ( de Kock 20, van der Dussen 65) Whatever was in those drinks, de Kock found something to make him fizz. He two-steps down the pitch and sends Bess flying over long-off. Quite charming. Brian Poole wants to set the record straight on his namesake, Brian Close: Close was England captain from 1966, not 1967 as one of your correspondents suggests. Obviously they do not have a PhD in ancient cricket history, like wot I have. I reckon there are a few Phds like that on the OBO... 70th over: South Africa 184-4 ( de Kock 15, van der Dussen 63) With ten overs to go until the new ball, this could be a match-changing 40 minutes or so. South Africa trail by 84; and Stokes sends down a pick n mix of short and good length toffees. That\u2019s DRINKS. 69th over: South Africa 183-4 ( de Kock 14, van der Dussen 63) Both batsmen fan a couple towards mid-on and run a couple of singles. Bess carries on squeezing the life out of the SA bats. And here is a telling stat: 68th over: South Africa 181-4 ( de Kock 13, van der Dussen 62) Root perseveres with Stokes who is tidier this time round, as the crowd construct a beer snake and hold it up for everyone to see. Guy Hornsby is feeling reflective. Afternoon Tanya, happy new year! It\u2019s actually my birthday today.. Happy Birthday! .. so I was obviously hoping for an unlikely Pope ton and a rattle of early wickets to set up an unexpected victory. What I get, of course, is about as England a present as you could make up. Just need a QdK ton to round it off. Maybe we could throw in one of the fast bowler\u2019s turning their ankle trying to stop a boundary to make it a vintage day? 67th over: South Africa 180-4 ( de Kock 13, van der Dussen 61) de Kock\u2019s urgency has infected VDD too, and the two of them collect four swift singles off Bess\u2019 over. 66th over: South Africa 176-4 ( de Kock 11, van der Dussen 59) The enforcer proves a bit leaky. VDD pulls then nurdles Stokes for a couple of fours, and the deficit slips below three figures Avitaj Mitra throws a rival to Stuart Broad into the mix. \u201cHe has no rival in cricket in the animated face stakes.\u201d I believe Imran Tahir would strongly object to that sentence. Okay, you might have a point. 65th over: South Africa 168-4 ( de Kock 11, van der Dussen 51) De Kock throws his bat, and front foot, at Bess and edges past slip for four. He repeats it, more stylishly and along the ground, the ball just picked up by Stuart Broad short of the boundary. Samuel Andrews was waiting for that wicket: Elgar had no answer to Bess-hovens ninth spin-phony Sorry. 64th over: South Africa 162-4 ( de Kock 5, van der Dussen 51) It\u2019s going to be less valiant stonewalling and more froth and bubbles now de Kock\u2019s at the crease. He languidly knocks four runs from Stokes\u2019s first two balls. Meanwhile, Kim Thonger has been spending his time wisely. Afternoon Tanya. Happy New Year! Coming right back at ya! I\u2019ve been going through the Wikipedia list of England captains. Since I started to watch Test cricket seriously, when Brian Close was captain from 1967 onwards, there haven\u2019t been many captains who I felt did not inspire confidence. They include Tony Lewis, John Emburey, Kevin Pietersen, Allan Lamb, Geoffrey Boycott. To this list I now add reluctantly, Joe Root, and he\u2019s had a longer chance to shine than most. I really think he needs to consider his position and I can\u2019t see how we improve as a team until he does. His motivational skills and tactical decisions seem woeful. It\u2019s very sad. He should have been one of the greats but the longer he stays now, the worse his reputation is likely to get. Now I\u2019ve written this of course there will be a miraculous change in his fortunes and I\u2019ll eat an article of clothing of your choice accordingly. I would say a towelled dressing gown, but even the thought of it gives me the shivers. Let\u2019s settle on a pair of slippers. 63rd over: South Africa 157-4 ( de Kock 0, van der Dussen 51) Dom Bess, sunglasses perched on his nose, reaps the benefit of keeping it tight. Utter delight from his teammates and, with Elgar gone, Root turns straight to Ben Stokes. From nowhere! Elgar has a moment of madness and lofts the ball high, Root scampers back from mid-off, further, further, further, till it plops into his hands! England\u2019s relief blasts out of every pore. 62nd over: South Africa 157-3 (Elgar 88, van der Dussen 51) The Barmy Army bellow away as Stuart Broad runs tirelessly in. Unfortunately for England, South Africa prod him tirelessly back. Would it be unfair to say they are showing rather more patience than England did yesterday? A cracking bouncer from Broad\u2019s fifth ball, that VDD goes to pull, but then changes his mind mid-stroke and has to execute a kind of strange dance. The effort, the sun and the suncream are writ large on Broad\u2019s forehead. 61st over: South Africa 156-3 (Elgar 87, van der Dussen 51) Another over is rattled through by Dom Bess, and here is something to mull over with your afternoon thoughts. 60th over: South Africa 154-3 (Elgar 86, van der Dussen 51) A couple of runs leak from Broad\u2019s over, but he is still posing a constant threat. VDD and Elgar playing him with elbows and jabs, not flowing strokes. The deficit dips to 114 and, good news, the Test is sold out at least until day three. 59th over: South Africa 153-3 (Elgar 85, van der Dussen 50) Ay-up, another maiden for Dom Bess who now has teetotal party figures of 17-2-34-0. What a strange few months it has been for him, superfluous to requirements at Somerset, yo-yoing to and fro from loan at Yorkshire, and now playing for England again. Something for Glamorgan/Australia to chew over, now that Australia have found their new run machine. 58th over: South Africa 153-3 (Elgar 85, van der Dussen 50) Oh! A whisker divides survival from the long walk home. Broad, whose sprinting, not chugging, in, gets one to zip past VDD\u2019s bat and somehow skim but not kiss the top of off-stump. Broad pulls a suitably amazed-rueful face. He has no rival in cricket in the animated-face stakes. 57th over: South Africa 152-3 (Elgar 84, van der Dussen 50) Bess, again, not afraid to toss it high one ball, whirl in tight the next. No real risk for the batsmen, not much for him in the pitch. But just one off the over, which is what he is being asked to do. 56th over: South Africa 151-3 (Elgar 83, van der Dussen 50) Broad slants the ball in at VDD, testing his nerve, who then angles at a rising ball, not without risk, and sends it down through third man for a boundary. That\u2019s his second Test fifty, in only his second match. Bravo. He plays the patience game very well. 55th over: South Africa 146-3 (Elgar 82, van der Dussen 46) Elgar turns on the pressure tap and lets it drip away with a sweet lofted drive over long on off Dom Bess and to the boundary. And out of the corner of my eye, the Christmas tree is staring at me. Would it be impolite to take it down tomorrow? 54th over: South Africa 141-3 (Elgar 76, van der Dussen 46) VDD gets the pleasure of six balls from Stuart Broad, captain\u2019s choice from the bowlers\u2019 favourite Wynberg end. On Sky, Nasser is talking about the line of cracks in pitch at the Wynberg end, says that he checked them out at the tea interval and they are a fraction outside off, so perhaps going wide of the crease, which Broad is doing, might bring them into play a little more. Anderson walks back onto the field. 53rd over: South Africa 141-3 (Elgar 76, van der Dussen 46) Bess starts the post-tea session with a maiden, still floating it up, still doing a job. And James Anderson is spotted on the England balcony, looks like he\u2019s stretching a lower limb. So... Jonny Bairstow is on the field and we think James Anderson is the man off the field... Dom Bess to bowl the first over. From the Sky studio, praise for Jimmy Anderson, criticism for Joe Root for bringing on Curran straight after lunch and not keeping the pressure on. Much interest on who Root brings on at the beginning of the next session. And thank you Mari\u00e9 too, I will read the link asap. Enjoying The Guardian\u2019s cricket commentary. Regarding your question about drought in SA:Dire drought conditions in a number of provinces in South Africa, including Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, Limpopo and parts of Western Cape province.More information available here: https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2019-11-13-south-africa-unprepared-for-drought-disaster-agrisa-warns-government/amp/ Thanks for the correspondence about the Southern African drought. Firstly, Victoria Falls. Dave Manby writes to say, \u201cThe vic falls photo is not the whole picture. The one end of the falls dries up every year in the dry season.\u201d And Andrew Gladwin, too: 52nd over: South Africa 141-3 (Elgar 76, van der Dussen 46) Elgar knocks Curran\u2019s final ball for a single, and that\u2019s tea. So: 81 runs from the session, 30 overs, a partnership of 101 - the South African batsmen walk happily up the stairs and into the shade of the eucalyptus (?) tree that leans over the pavilion. South Africa\u2019s session, patiently waiting and then knocking the loose balls away. 51st over: South Africa 140-3 (Elgar 76, van der Dussen 46) With a nudge off Root, Elgar brings up the 100 partnership with VDD, and that\u2019s the highest partnership of the series. Just a single from the over - and one more, I think, to be bowled before tea. 50th over: South Africa 139-3 (Elgar 76, van der Dussen 46) Curran replaces Anderson and immediately releases some of the pressure when Elgar tucks into a short ball and pulls it through square leg for a juicy four. Though Curran does seem to have the knack of taking wickets early in his spells, so will/might/could make good the damage in the next over. Good old John Starbuck, has the lowdown on cricketers and numbers: I can\u2019t recall the exact protocol for shirt numbers either (over 41), but having them at all stems from the long-standing search for what we used to call Brighter Cricket. The concept was floated in the 1960s but not much got done. I think it was the Australians who introduced individual players\u2019 numbers, based on where they were in the list of representing the country at Test level, and which they displayed on the baggy green. It was a good idea as it strengthened morale, as well as helping to identify players. Later, these numbers appeared on shirts/jumpers. England followed their lead. It seems a pity this wasn\u2019t done world-wide because it solves the problems of allocating numbers, rather than a new set of rules, which cricket authorities appear to be really keen on, perhaps as a means of them leaving a legacy. 49th over: South Africa 134-3 (Elgar 71, van der Dussen 46) Just three easy runs off Joe Root, who hasn\u2019t yet lured Elgar or VDD into the mistakes he might have hoped for. 48th over: South Africa 131-3 (Elgar 70, van der Dussen 44) The deficit is now down to 138, and tight as Anderson is bowling, England could do with a breakthrough before tea. Thank you to Andrew Gladwin for this: I remember the day zero threats in Cape Town, I think they cancelled all youth cricket that year? Terrifying times. This picture from Victoria Falls taken last month is chilling. 47th over: South Africa 129-3 (Elgar 69, van der Dussen 43) Joe Root tries his own hand, delivering from wide of the crease to Elgar, trying to complete the over in record time . Which might not please Anderson that much. Some very wise words on Virat Kohli appear in my inbox from Abhijato Sensarma. I love the idea of Kohli being the \u201cunlikeliest cricket romantic of this generation.\u201d Kohli has been the unlikeliest cricket romantic of this generation. Sure, he was always good at batting. But an arrogance was intrinsic to his behaviour, which along with his affinity for the white ball from the outset presented an image of someone who thought he was bigger than the game, especially its modern outlook. However, he has turned out to be a huge cricket geek underneath his tattoo-complemented self. In India, his delivery of statements as skipper about supporting the longest format of the sport has immensely helped in the sale of Test cricket as a concept. His opposition to these new ideas aligns with the feelings of most purists. And we all know that when he speaks, the world listens. Hopefully ICC does too. 46th over: South Africa 129-3 (Elgar 69, van der Dussen 43) Ah, man alive! Van der Dussen fences at Anderson and Stokes dives full to his left at second slip and clings onto a lip-smacker, only for the ball to bounce out of his clasp as his elbow hits the ground. Anderson contains his thoughts; Stokes folds his arms and stares. Another maiden. 45th over: South Africa 129-3 (Elgar 68, van der Dussen 42) Kevin Pietersen not shy of giving Anderson some stick on TalkSport. Just a couple of singles from Bess\u2019s over as the clock hand ticks towards tea. 44th over: South Africa 127-3 (Elgar 68, van der Dussen 42) What did I say? Better from Anderson, who incidentally has gone heavy on the hair wax today. A maiden, that van der Dussen is forced to prod at more awkwardly that he\u2019d like. And an email! Hi Tanya, and a very happy new year to you! And you too, Romeo. It seems rather like Root is banking on a Yes-No-Sorry run out for his next wicket. It does have that sort of slightly sleepytown feel to the session... 43rd over: South Africa 127-3 (Elgar 68, van der Dussen 42) Bess wears No. 47 on his back. I can\u2019t just now remember what the rule is for shirts. Do players just choose the number they like (eg Root 66) and the new players get the left overs? What happens to a one-Test wonder? Has he bagged the number for life? Bess has now bowled 12 overs for 26. 41st over: South Africa 124-3 (Elgar 67, van der Dussen 40) Anderson plugs away outside off, not causing any great concern to the South African batsman right now. Famous last words, obvs. Cape Town looking truly glorious, all royal blues and emerald greens. Seems hard to believe the drought that has been hitting much of southern Africa. Read this morning that 25 per cent of Zambians are in need of emergency food aid. If anyone is reading this in South Africa, would love to know if South African too is still suffering from drought conditions. Edgar swaps gloves at the end of the over. 40th over: South Africa 121-3 (Elgar 65, van der Dussen 39) Bess not trying anything too tricksy, just dotting it down on or about off stump. Looks brimful of confidence as he always does. Play is heading towards the attritional, think forcing down that last helping of Christmas pudding just to empty the fridge of Christmas. 39th over: South Africa 119-3 (Elgar 64, van der Dussen 38) A gasp of excitement when Ben Stokes seems to scoop up a catch off the floor from a van der Dussen poke off Anderson, but replays show it is a bump ball. Van der Dussen somewhat nervously plays out the rest of a maiden. 38th over: South Africa 118-3 (Elgar 64, van der Dussen 37) Dom Bess, bowling arm whirling straight over his head, think man trying reach the very top of his height rather than sideways for a box of cornflakes, speeds through another accurate over. They potter through for a couple of singles. 37th over: South Africa 117-3 (Elgar 63, van der Dussen 37) Joe Root feels around for the runes and brings on Anderson to a heavily-weighted off-side field. To his fourth ball in the over, Anderson tumbles into his follow-through, actually more into his landing foot. And he continues to scuff away at the footmarks discontentedly throughout the rest of the over, like a rabbit digging a scrape. Elgar leaves his final ball, riskily/skillfully. Something to throw into the four-five-day Test mix: 36th over: South Africa 116-3 (Elgar 62, van der Dussen 37) Thanks Adam, great stuff as always, and Happy New Year OBO readers! Sky show-off a fish-eye (?) camera view of Cape Town which shows idyllic blue sky but has all the houses falling away at the side in a slightly queasy way. Which is a bit how England must be feeling right now, what with no-balls and Elgar inching and nugetting towards his Adam-predicted century. Anyway, Dom Bess whizzes through his ninth over without incident. 36th over: South Africa 115-3 (Elgar 61, van der Dussen 37) Stokes with the final over of the hour and we get a look at some further no-balls from Stokes. It\u2019s an absolute joke. It\u2019s a productive over for the hosts with six runs collected around the sweepers without risk, this partnership now moving to 75. Drinks! And with that, it\u2019s time for me to say goodbye. It was great to hang out, let\u2019s to it again tonight from Sydney and then tomorrow when I\u2019ll be back for the afternoon at Newlands. Now to Tanya Aldred who will take you through to the close. Bye! Oh, and Tim Cutler on specialist TV umps - makes a very good point as I depart. \u201cA Dubai-based \u2018bunker\u2019 with feeds going to a specialised team of trained pros in a controlled environment is the only way forward for mine. No need to fly them around the world. Save on cost, emissions, easily to drive/change policy.\u201d 35th over: South Africa 109-3 (Elgar 60, van der Dussen 33) Bess skips through another frugal over, Elgar right over the splice in defence time and again. I\u2019m not far from handing over to Tanya, but I\u2019ll declare him a lock for a century here. 34th over: South Africa 108-3 (Elgar 60, van der Dussen 32) Elgar races through for a quick single and seems to have hurt his back in the process? At the end of the Stokes over, they call for the physio. Along the way, we see another delivery where he has overstepped. \u201cThe on-field umpires aren\u2019t looking for it,\u201d says Nasser. \u201cBut doesn\u2019t somebody have to?\u201d They don\u2019t listen to me but they might listen to Nas. 33rd over: South Africa 104-3 (Elgar 58, van der Dussen 30) A confidence-building drive for van der Dussen, getting a big stride in at Bess before stroking him through cover for four. The spinner draws his length back just a tad to finish. He has bowled seven overs now for 17 runs. Doing his job well, not leaking many runs. 32nd over: South Africa 100-3 (Elgar 58, van der Dussen 26) Ooi! Stokes gets one to take off from around the wicket at Elgar, happy to let it crash into his gloves. Earlier in the over he flicked him for a couple but the main job for England here is wickets not runs. Although that\u2019ll change in an hour or so if they can\u2019t break this. \u201cAfternoon Adam, and Happy New Year to you too.\u201d Likewise, Simon McMahon! If last year taught us anything, surely it was the benefits of compromise, as opposed to certainty. Why not four and a half day Tests?\u201d They\u2019re more likely to go with three and a half days so the TV commentators can get back to their home city in time for dinner (and/or nightclubs) by night four. 31st over: South Africa 97-3 (Elgar 56, van der Dussen 25) Dom Bess is doing his reputation the world of good here, bringing Elgar forward with ample dip. He finds van der Dussen\u2019s inside edge later in the set with one that really bites. Good areas. 30th over: South Africa 95-3 (Elgar 55, van der Dussen 24) Oh dear, Ben Stokes is even further over the line with the first delivery they show up on the screen into his new spell. This is ridiculous on multiple levels. One of those is that the central ump cops a bruising when they don\u2019t call them but they are ultimately skewered when calling them incorrectly. Let\u2019s not forget the Richard Illingworth/Adam Voges debacle from Wellington in 2016. Anyway, it\u2019s a good over with the all-rounder generating plenty of shape back towards van der Dussen. 29th over: South Africa 91-3 (Elgar 55, van der Dussen 20) Bess is back in place of Curran, straight back on the line and length he found before lunch. As Mike Haysman says on the TV, there\u2019s a puff of dust where the final delivery pitches. 28th over: South Africa 90-3 (Elgar 55, van der Dussen 19) KP was all over this on the telly, explaining how the technology was used in a T20 series he was recently covering to deal with the front foot no-ball line. I\u2019ve been banging away about this for nearly four years now. WE HAD A TRIAL in 2016, where the TV umpire watched the front line in an ODI series between England and Pakistan, and it WORKED A TREAT! The ICC told me then that it would be rolled out everywhere. But, nothing happened. In 2018, they told me it was... too expensive. Too expensive to use cameras that are already there? Odd. The good news is that they have realised the error in this and are going to roll out some more trials in the first half of this year. My conspiracy theory is that the TV umpire isn\u2019t interested in watching the front line on a TV screen all day (toggling back and forth, alerting the central umpire when there is an overstep). It further bolsters the case for specialist TV umpires, if you ask me. Take the job away entirely from the elite panel officials and develop a new generation of umpires who understand the technology intimately. Rant over! NO BALL! OH DEAR! Broad has won van der Dussen\u2019s edge with a brute of a ball but the technology shows he is a long, long way over the line. He\u2019s called back! 27th over: South Africa 86-3 (Elgar 55, van der Dussen 16) Too short from Curran at his pace, punished from the man in form Elgar with his compact pull shot. No issues here. They\u2019ve made the most of the 23 minutes since lunch, adding 26 runs. 26th over: South Africa 80-3 (Elgar 50, van der Dussen 15) Excellent hand this from Elgar, keeping the show on the road after those three quick wickets. He earns the chance to raise his bat with a couple down to fine leg - another poor delivery from Broad in that region - then a quick single in front of the wicket. That\u2019s his 26th score above 50 in Test cricket, 12 of those converted into three figures. Pete Salmon for a second bite of the cherry. \u201cPunishing tems by deducting World Ranking points doesn\u2019t work I think. First, how excited is everyone about the Test Championship. A little bit, but that\u2019s it, even amongst us tragics. And I suspect the players even less so - how keen are they on an extra match on test fees rather than silly IPL type money. Second, even if we were all excited, players included, the only reward is playing in the final, which means only 2-4 teams each cycle will give a toss about losing points. Has to be cash I think, and proper amounts.\u201d We\u2019ll have to agree to disagree here. The players are very into the WTC - those I\u2019ve talked to about it, anyway. They\u2019ve wanted this league for a long time. The problem with the WTC is the weird points allocation but they will surely fix that for the next cycle with some sort of balancing mechanism. It\u2019s fairly ridiculous that Pakistan are third on the table with one win from four Tests. If I was King? I\u2019d draw from the Women\u2019s championship where three matches from each series count and they ensure a minimum of three Tests are played in each. No more two-Test flings! Then we put our heads together on how to keep the other Tests in four/five match series relevant to the WTC. I haven\u2019t worked that bit out yet. 25th over: South Africa 77-3 (Elgar 47, van der Dussen 15) Elgar keeps scoring and it is helping transfer the pressure back onto the visitors. van der Dussen takes advantage later in the over, crushing a half-volley away to the cover boundary. Shot. I\u2019m surprised it took him this long to get a chance at Test level. \u201cI understand the ECB are developing a concept to be deemed \u2018The Thousand\u2019 where both sides have a maximum of 1000 deliveries each to fashion a result in the long form of the game,\u201d emails David Lewis. Droll. The \u2018exciting, modern simplicity of the concept will be sure to bring a new audience to the long form game and invigorate what is potentially becoming a little stale\u2019 the press release concludes.\u201d Very good. I know it\u2019s tough, and the link is probably there, but let\u2019s try and avoid this removing into Hundred Bashing territory. We had all summer for that, yeah? 24th over: South Africa 72-3 (Elgar 46, van der Dussen 11) Disco Stu Broad to take up the attack from the pavilion end, where he caused all sorts of bother before lunch. He\u2019ll want to get a good look at van der Dussen early in this spell but the right-hander does well, pushing the first ball past point to get off strike. Elgar keeps ticking the board over in his direction, taking a misdirected short ball of his hip down to the boundary at fine leg. To finish, one to cover to keep the strike. \u201cApparently people on the Western Terrace have a song about Dom Bess to the tune of the Divinyls I Touch Myself,\u201d reports Iain Noble. They do??? \u201cAs I don\u2019t attend Headingley other than when there\u2019s a good chance of Lancs thrashing the Tykes (which hasn\u2019t been on the cards for a while now) I haven\u2019t heard it. Perhaps you could publish the words in the OBO? Even if it\u2019s rude. Especially if it\u2019s rude.\u201d Well, if that is the case and someone has the words for me, I\u2019ll consider it! 23rd over: South Africa 66-3 (Elgar 41, van der Dussen 10) Elgar presents a nice, broad blade to begin and nearly beats mid-off. He does score from the next ball, getting a couple off his hip. Seeing them beautifully, he backs that up with the shot of the day, an on-drive for four. Outstanding timing; he\u2019s into the 40s. \u201cMy tongue-in-cheek suggestion regarding over rates from a few years ago was to get the players to make the short overs up on the day immediately following the match,\u201d suggests Graeme Thorn. \u201cjJst like in any other profession where if you hadn\u2019t finished your work, you had to come in on your weekend or on a day off to get it done.\u201d The players are back on the field. Sammy Curran gets the first chance with the ball, replacing Dom Bess. He has a couple of slips. Elgar is on strike. PLAY! \u201c\u2018Morning.\u201d And to you, John Starbuck. \u201cIf you want to penalise a side for slow over rates, in a 4-day or 5-day game, don\u2019t bother with fining the captain because it doesn\u2019t work. Instead, in an age when Test matches have a points system for world ranking, simply deduct one point for every session\u2019s over rate failure with umpires allowing some discretion for slow play owing to bad weather and unforeseen events. If this means some sides end up with a minus figure, so what? It ought to mean more spin bowling, which is a Good Thing.\u201d Yep, that\u2019s definitely the way to do it. Use the points, not the cash. Ian Forth has an alternative view: \u201cI don\u2019t really get the furore concerning over rates,\u201d he says. \u201cThere seems moral outrage that spectators are being \u2018short changed\u2019. But how many spectators actually watch an entire day\u2019s test cricket anyway? At most matches I\u2019ve been to the ground\u2019s half empty at the start of play, two thirds empty at the start of the other sessions and often half empty at stumps. Compared to problems like four day tests, uneven contests, match fixing and so on, over rates only become a real problem in matches such as Port of Spain in 1990 or Karachi in 2000 where a team deliberately slows the game right down to avoid defeat.\u201d I\u2019d spin that to why shouldn\u2019t they get the correct number of overs in? They do in county cricket. They do in Sheffield Shield cricket. The women always hit their targets when playing Test cricket. Why do the men get a leave pass? Back to scrapping the fifth day. \u201cAlternatively, is there something to be said for having the ultimately disappointing result come after just 4 days of futile hope, rather than 5?\u201d asks Matt Dony. I feel like we don\u2019t get many bore draws these days, though? If a Test is going the distance, usually at least one team can win it late. But I\u2019m going on gut feel there, which is always a bit dicey. \u201cWhere do you stand on the pitch (as t\u2019were)?\u201d asks my man Gary Naylor. \u201cThis time yesterday, most pundits were telling us that it was a belter, when it clearly wasn\u2019t - have they changed their tune? Looks a good advert for four day Tests to me.\u201d I\u2019ll take the second half of that as a comment! It still looks a very good batting track with one very big crack running down that fourth stump line? It could be one of those Test pitches where it is very different from one end to the other. Good fun! \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Hello, Brian Withington! We\u2019re all here this morning. \u201cWrote this before seeing Kim Thonger\u2019s query. I am finding it difficult to shake the (unoriginal) feeling that debating between four and five day tests feels a bit like Nero fiddling in the current context of swathes of Aus literally burning (to the backdrop of unspeakable political leadership the world over). So is our beloved game a welcome distraction or soothing balm during these troubled times? As a child I was rather troubled by the prospect of the earth being engulfed by a solar fireball within four or five billion years - my hasn\u2019t the time flown by. I\u2019d love to hear what Nasser thinks about it all - why don\u2019t people like him end up running things?\u201d Good shout: if Nasser ran for something, I\u2019d happily run his campaign. But why would they bother? I saw a prominent Australian footballer post Richard Flanagan\u2019s powerful piece on the New York Times about the Australian fires and then had a look at the replies to his tweet. Why subject yourself to that if you already have a fairly big megaphone as a celebrity sportsperson? Not to say I wish more wouldn\u2019t consider it. I have my eye on one former Australian Test player who I want to run for parliament one day. We\u2019ll see if I\u2019m persuasive enough! More on four-day Tests. \u201cI think it is pretty much the end of society as we know it,\u201d declares Adrian Goldman. Gotta love a strong opening. \u201cIt may be, however, the only way that the current England side would ever be able to bat out a draw. And I am not even certain of that.\u201d As for Frank Bradley, he\u2019s also firmly in the anti-camp. \u201cThe question remains, WHY? None of the reasons/excuses cut the mustard. Unless of course the players (As celebrities of course), will put on singing, dancing and comic impersonations on the now free day to attract a different audience.\u201d Why? They say to free up many, many days of scheduled time that doesn\u2019t get used. With that, they can play more cricket. I mean, yeah? That\u2019s not unreasonable as a starting point. But at what cost? Too high, for mine. Let\u2019s have four-day Tests from time to time, when it is that or nothing. As I said earlier, New Zealand are in that boat a lot of the time and they want to play more often. As my colleague Tim Wigmore has argued, two four-day Tests gets a series done in two weeks. But the WTC suggestion is that it would be compulsory - meaning Ashes, the lot. News in from Chris Stocks, who is covering the Test for the paper at Newlands. He reports that Archer is \u201cin line to be fit\u201d for the Third Test at Port Elizabeth next week. The 24-year-old has been cleared of major damage to his right elbow after being ruled out in Cape Town. We\u2019ll have the full story with you shortly. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Hello, Kim Thonger. \u201cWe awake to find England bowling well and taking wickets but are concerned that actually we are just in heaven following an overnight nuclear conflagration caused by the orange lunatic whose name shall not pass our lips. Please confirm we are still alive and reading about reality?\u201d I promise, despite what the twitter trends say, WWIII has not broken out. Let\u2019s just enjoy the comforting distraction that is Test Match cricket, I say. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Peter Salmon, great to hear from you too. \u201cRight, four days tests. Hate the idea like all good people. Seems to me that any time one side gets a good first innings lead (say 100+) the team batting third will play for a draw, probably from the start of day 3, sometimes from the end of day 2. But... they are going to happen aren\u2019t they, like wifi and pop music. Seems to me that rather than having this endless, pointless debate about whether its good, we need to loom at how to make it work. The main problem will be over rates. Let\u2019s keep it simple. Each session a certain number. Every over short the captain loses 25% of their match fee. Third umpire has a stop watch to check for added time (5 mins an over) so the captain can appeal at the end of the match, but only then. If captains want to play for free, they are welcome.\u201d Maybe they figure with the WTC giving such a high reward for wins (especially in two/three match series) that we won\u2019t see teams play for draws? The guts of this is that they see a chance to make more cash by scrapping day five. The rest is noise. I have a film clip recommendation in from Abhijato Sensarma. Let\u2019s take a look. The old firm do it again. After conceding 17 runs in two overs to start, England hearts were quickly in mouths. But Broad then Anderson found their mark soon enough and ran through the Proteas\u2019 top order before they won the opportunity to cash in on a great day for batting. Malan, Hamza and du Plessis all gave catches to the cordon - the middle of those a brilliant take by Stokes - to quickly get the visitors back on track after such a disappointing opening day. Importantly, Bess also did his job to keep it tight up the other end in his first spell back at the top table. Elgar, meanwhile, is batting beautifully for the home side. Good stuff. 22nd over: South Africa 60-3 (Elgar 35, van der Dussen 10) Stokes gets the final over before lunch, replacing Anderson after his fine spell. Three slips are in place as he charges in at van der Dussen, the right-hander leaving whenever he can but he can\u2019t let the ball go on the fourth-stump crack, pushing and missing at a ball that moves appreciably off the seam. That\u2019s going to be a real bother for batsmen throughout the rest of this match. He keeps his cool though, picking up a couple through midwicket before leaving the last couple to get to LUNCH. The end of a big session for England. They needed early wickets and snagged three of them. 21st over: South Africa 58-3 (Elgar 35, van der Dussen 8) There was criticism of Dom Bess when he debuted at age 20 (the youngest England off-spinner ever!) at Lord\u2019s last year that he didn\u2019t contain well enough. His ropey figures supported that view. He\u2019s certainly doing that job here though, backing his skills and giving the ball a chance to spin by giving it plenty of flight rather than pushing it through. A lot to like about his return to the bowling crease at the top level so far. 20th over: South Africa 56-3 (Elgar 34, van der Dussen 7) It might have been not out but what a superb inswinger it was from Anderson to win the decision in the first place. He\u2019s been hitting the deck and shaping away shaping away shaping away... then that. It\u2019s been said time and again, but he\u2019s the most skilful bowler of his generation and surely one of the most capable seamers to ever play. It\u2019s a different game when Elgar is on strike here, the left-hander timing a couple past point before keeping the strike with a tuck. There are five minutes left until lunch. HAS ANDERSON TRAPPED VAN DER DUSSEN? He\u2019s given out on the field but has sent it straight upstairs for review. And he\u2019s right to do so, there\u2019s a big inside edge so Umpire Reiffel has to change his decision to NOT OUT! That\u2019s why we have DRS. 19th over: South Africa 52-3 (Elgar 31, van der Dussen 6) Elgar eases Bess down the ground for one - he\u2019s in great shape. Of course, he saluted for a ton at Newlands against Australia before all hell broke loose in March 2018. van der Dussen does the same, out to cover, to keep the strike. Another tidy over. 18th over: South Africa 50-3 (Elgar 30, van der Dussen 5) Anderson once again at van der Dussen, beating from another delivery that seams away early in the set. As the TV tells me, this is the end where Philander was able to generate plenty of movement off the track yesterday. There\u2019s no respite for the new man. Maiden. \u201cUsually I can bet on being on some beautiful foreign beach while following your OBO,\u201d writes Andy Wilson, who I am very pleased to hear from. \u201cThis morning it is from a surprisingly sunny Yorkshire.Anyway onto business... I think that the Aussie development of Marnus Labuschagne is borderline cheating. You should be allowed one of him or Smith but not both. So I reckon you should get your pick of England\u2019s top order as a swap. Except Burns. If you had both you would need 6 or 7 day tests just to get their batting in. So swap for someone who can dash to 20 or 30 and the world is a far better and harmonious place. Hope all is well with you and you and family are safe from the fires.\u201d Just think, Marnus probably wouldn\u2019t have played in the Ashes if not for Archer knocking Smith out. Now they are - as they kids say - BFFs. And it shows. And thanks fot the kind words. My family\u2019s farm is on the other side of Victoria, so they\u2019re all set for now. But, yes, it\u2019s a terribly sad and grim time for everyone. 17th over: South Africa 50-3 (Elgar 30, van der Dussen 5) Really good loop from Bess from around the wicket to Elgar, getting himself in the game. He has a slip and a silly point in operation, Elgar pushing past that man through the air to get off strike. When he\u2019s back down the business end, they take that man out to a catching cover, hoping he\u2019ll repeat the error but he\u2019s happily forward in defence. \u201cTouches of Graeme Swann in Dom Bess\u2019 action wouldn\u2019t you say Adam?\u201d tweets @Martin_Laidler. \u201cLoopy windmill action (technical term).\u201d Yep, a good comparison. Now, if only he can take 250-odd Test wickets in the next five years! 16th over: South Africa 48-3 (Elgar 29, van der Dussen 4) Edge, four! Through third slip. Root has three catchers back there but not in that very spot. Jimmy has a word about it to van der Dussen, as is the custom when such a thing happens. This is a much better spell from the man with 578 Test scalps to his name. 15th over: South Africa 44-3 (Elgar 29, van der Dussen 0) Bess is on for his first over in Test cricket since Headingley last June. Since then, he\u2019s seen plenty of Second XI cricket, a loan to Yorkshire and remains Somerset\u2019s second spinner. But he\u2019s coming on at a great time with his side well on top. Elgar tries to get on top of him first ball and gets four for it, but not without risk driving on the up past cover. Encouraged by that, he lands the rest of his over right on the spot. Good start. 14th over: South Africa 40-3 (Elgar 25, van der Dussen 0) A lot of work to do for Rassie van der Dussen in this his second Test. He defends the one ball he has to see off from Anderson here, the champion quick completing a wicket maiden. Jimmy! Swung around to follow Broad he\u2019s into the book straight away. It\u2019s a lovely delivery, nipping away just enough off the seam to find the captain\u2019s edge. Classic Anderson. Stokes does the rest, a staightforward snaffle this time. 13th over: South Africa 40-2 (Elgar 25, du Plessis 1) Curran is really holding up his end of the bargain here, building the pressure at Elgar to help Broad do what he needs to at the other end. du Plessis is off the mark with one around the corner. 12th over: South Africa 38-2 (Elgar 24, du Plessis 0) Right in that channel at du Plessis outside the off-stump then attacking the stumps with a yorker-length delivery. I don\u2019t think it is overstating it to say that Broad is bowling as well as he ever has at the moment. This is a fantastic spell. Well handled by home skipper. If you\u2019ve been watching the dreadful fires in my country and want to do something to help the criical relief effort, consider getting involved with the fantastic auction being held by Russell Jackson, who many OBO readers would know as a former Guardian sports writer and editor. As a kid, he collected the autographs of ten Test captains on a lovely blank bat. To do his bit, he\u2019s giving it away to the highest bidder with the money going to where it is needed most. 11th over: South Africa 38-2 (Elgar 24, du Plessis 0) Curran does his job, sending down an accurate maiden at Elgar. Broad now gets another go at the new man. \u201cGood morning Adam.\u201d And to you, Steve Ditchburn. \u201cSomeone really needs to teach Jimmy Anderson to play balls on their length. There was absolutely no point in playing a shot to that last ball - it was going way over the stumps - and he got out similarly when England were trying to save the game a few years ago and there were only a few overs left in the day. I know he\u2019s not there as a batsman but a little coaching would be beneficial.\u201d I think he gets a leave pass there? They did add 35! 10th over: South Africa 38-2 (Elgar 24, du Plessis 0) After the drinks break, he gets one look at du Plessis to complete the successful over, defended from the crease. They exchange a couple of words. \u201cHe\u2019s got his knees up,\u201d says KP on telly. \u201cHe\u2019s bowling really, really well.\u201d He then hints at saying something not very nice about Anderson, which we\u2019re going to have to get used to with him on commentary. But forget that for now, Big Bad Stuart Broad might be on one. And whaddacatch! What a good catch that is! Stokes to his right at second slip, diving low to the ground and getting both hands to it. Fantastic work in there. Broad wasn\u2019t put off after being driven for four from the first ball of this over, keeping the ball full and getting this reward for it. Thanks to Broad, the visitors are up and about. 9th over: South Africa 34-1 (Elgar 24, Hamza 1) Slammin\u2019 Sammy Curran gets his first chance of the morning, replacing Anderson. Elgar is happy enough with that decision, flicking his first delivery away to the boundary then repeating the very same shot next ball, albeit for three this time. Hamza now, off the mark with a push behind point. By the end of the over, Curran finds his line and length. \u201cKeep tests five-day, cut the working week to four,\u201d suggests ChipShopChop to me on twitter. \u201cStart tests on a Friday to well-rested full houses. New golden age ensues.\u201d Another proposition that\u2019ll have a lot of support in these parts! 8th over: South Africa 26-1 (Elgar 17, Hamza 0) Broad is stump to stump to Hamza straight away, clearly working to a plan. With his third ball to him he finds the outside edge, bouncing before it reaches gully but another good sign. We all know what a confidence bowler he is. Oooi, he finishes his wicket maiden with a beauty, pitching middle and off before seaming away gorgeously and evading the edge. This edge goes to hand! First ball of his new over, Broad has Malan steering the easiest of catches to Root at first slip. That looked a good matchup for England and it has paid off. Needless to say, they really needed that early breakthrough. 7th over: South Africa 26-0 (Elgar 17, Malan 5) Edge, four! Anderson is doing the yards against Elgar and has won the edge with the final ball of another handy over but it lands in front of the cordon before skipping away to the rope. Frustrating. 6th over: South Africa 20-0 (Elgar 11, Malan 5) Broad to Malan and he\u2019s beating him with a lovely delivery moving away from the blade with his second offering. He\u2019s a touch wide of the off-stump by the end of the set but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll back himself against a man on debut if he can get a few consistent overs in at him. \u201cGood morning Adam from a hot, sunny Cape Town.\u201d Sounds fantastic coming from where I am in chilly North London, Trevor Tutu. \u201cYesterday your colleague, Tim, suggested that my son, who was going to Newlands\u2019 to barrack the Barmy Army, would not have a very good time of it. He was right, but not in the way Tim meant. My son reports that while Stokes and Root were still in, they were all having a really good time, and that banter and repartee were exchanged in good humour. But, that as soon as the England collapse began, it put a pall over the proceedings. He says banter, which would have drawn a swift retort, before went unanswered.\u201d Sports fans - we are fickle. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a nationality thing. 5th over: South Africa 20-0 (Elgar 11, Malan 5) Anderson is giving the ball a chance in terms of where he is pitching it but there isn\u2019t a lot going on here in terms of lateral movement. Elgar has played a lot of cricket and will know that if he can get through the first hour here, it is going to be a dream to bat on later. In turn, he\u2019s taking no risks, picking up a couple with soft hands past gully to finish. 4th over: South Africa 17-0 (Elgar 9, Malan 4) Better from Broad too, keeping Elgar in defence from around the wicket. Nasser notes that he no longer has a third slip, that catcher redeployed to extra cover after those two boundaries. \u201cAnderson and Broad hate going for runs,\u201d he says, noting that Root has been integral in getting the tall quick to pitch the baller fuller over the last couple of years. He\u2019s very close to finish his maiden, jagging back at the left-hander and finding his inside egde. 3rd over: South Africa 17-0 (Elgar 9, Malan 4) Anderson settles well, giving Malan nothing in and around that off-stump line. He plays out the maiden watchfully. \u201cGood afternoon.\u201d Hello, Amod Paranjape. \u201cWill this be the last series of Joe Root as Captain to preserve Joe Root the batsman?\u201d It\u2019s getting easier to buil that case, I\u2019m afraid. He\u2019s smart enough to know that. But we have a long way to go here. 2nd over: South Africa 17-0 (Elgar 9, Malan 4) Elgar gets his first boundary early on too, timing a full Broad delivery wide of mid-off for four. There\u2019s no batswing required there - all timing. Those feel really good. Broad, around the wicket, immediately drags his length back and has the left-hander leaving close to his off-stump. The over gets very expensive at the end though, Broad\u2019s angle cutting Elgar in half and also beating Buttler, running away for four byes. Unlucky. But to finish he\u2019s again too full, as he was to begin the over, so the left-hander takes full advantage through the cover region on this occasion. They\u2019re off to a flyer. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit self selecting here, enthusiasts who follow OBO at any and all hours but reducing the days makes no sense to me in that... at 5, it\u2019s a very different game,\u201d is the very reasonable assessment of Peter Gibbs. \u201c4 days promotes more sloggery and perhaps a narrower range of abilities and we have plenty of that in its\u2019 purest form at the other end of the scale. 5 days is a different game, not better or worse. 4 days is reductive.\u201d To quote Derek Pringle on twitter yesterday on that same line: \u201cOver the centuries Test cricket has evolved into the highest form of the game to be played over five days. Lopping a day off to secure its survival is like removing one horn from a black rhino to make it less attractive to poachers... barmy.\u201d 1st over: South Africa 5-0 (Elgar 1, Malan 4) Anderson is right where he needs to be at Elgar, who gets off the mark with a compact push to cover. Pieter Malan\u2019s turn, the 30-year-old playing his debut Test innings here. The Newlands crowd know their cricket and give him a solid round of applause when the new right-hander defends the first ball from the middle of his bat. They\u2019re even happier when he gets off the mark from the final ball of the over with a lovely cut shot, putting it away past the vacant point region. A classy way to get out of the blocks. \u201cThe question to ask here is - will the four-day format benefit cricket?\u201d asks Abhijato Sensarma on our topic of four-day Tests. \u201cThere will be more aggressive batting from the batsmen, and lesser importance or time given to defence. This may lead to an erosion of technique as well as the spirit of the purest form of the game we hold so dear. Excessively defensive bowling is likely become a feature too. Of course, one cannot deny this will increase the format\u2019s commercial viability at a time the format is being neglected financially. The players will benefit if the \u2018trickle down effect\u2019 is to be believed. It is not. Also, another argument put forward about giving players breathing space in their workload is not convincing - more LOIs will probably be fitted in during this period of vacancy by the ever-greedy administrators. Frankly, I do not mind four-day cricket. But it should be an option for sides to opt for, not compulsory.\u201d The players are back on the field. Jimmy has the ball in his hand and Dean Elgar is taking strike for the Proteas. PLAY! I\u2019m looking forward to watching Dom Bess bowl. I spoke to his Somerset coach about the offspinner\u2019s 18 months in the wilderness after his two Tests in 2018. \u201cWhat say I?\u201d asks Jane Evans of four-day Tests. \u201cNooooooooooooooooooooooo!\u201d This is a view consistent across my inbox. I\u2019m fairly sure I know what administrators would say to that: you all love Test cricket anyway and this isn\u2019t about you. They know we\u2019re hooked and will keep coming back regardless. Hmm. It appears as though an incorrect email address was popped in the top of the OBO, so some of your emails might not have reached me. That\u2019s fixed now. Apologies. Some more on four-day Tests during the change. \u201cI say I\u2019m really looking forward to contemplating sunny skies on the non-existent fifth day of a Test that\u2019s been given up as a draw because of rain earlier in the match,\u201d tweets @ejhchess. Indeed. Andrew Samson, the TMS stats guru (currently working for SEN radio in Australia) noted in their coverage overnight that through the last decade, the average overs bowled per day is 79. Of course, weather and shocking over rates contrbute to that figure. His/my point: it\u2019s a waste of time using 98 overs per day as the benchmark when building the case that fifth days aren\u2019t required anymore. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hi, Tim Maitland. \u201cGiven the availability of floodlights and the fact that the DRS-era game is significantly different to the \u2018good old days\u2019 when you could take a big stride, hide your bat behind your pad and be given not out all day, you could argue that a review of whether 5 days is better than 4 has never made more sense. I can\u2019t help feeling they\u2019re fiddling while Rome burns. The far more obvious answer to test cricket\u2019s problems in attracting crowds is switching to the day-night test, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I\u2019m with you on the second point. We now have a dependable pink ball, so let\u2019s use it more often if that\u2019s what it takes. I\u2019m also in favour of throwing a pink ball out there to stop players coming off for bad light if floodlights are available. Just until the close, that is. Then back to the red one when they resume the next day. Here\u2019s that final wicket. Anderson steers Rabada into the hands of van der Dussen at first slip, ending this tenth wicket stand at 35. He was down there after a misjudgment from Pope from the first ball of the over, digging a yorker out to midwicket and calling two but there was never two there. But he did really well, walking off unbeaten on 61. 91st over: England 268-9 (Pope 60, Anderson 4) Nortje has the pace to keep Pope quiet as they continue the strike-milking game. He doesn\u2019t take the singles to cover and can\u2019t make contact with the short stuff when it eventually arrives at the tail end of the over. He does get a run for the tally, via a bouncer that is called as a wide by Paul Reiffel for leaping too high. The touring supporters are loving that. He rebowls the final ball and the Surrey man makes room to bunt a length delivery over mid-off for the single they crave to keep him on strike. That\u2019s the way. \u201cI agree that I think it is a done deal to make 4 day test cricket,\u201d says Damian Horton. \u201cI expect the main reason is it makes financial sense to drop day 5 (nothing to do with players!!). Day 5 often has the full expense of staff, food, security etc but often doesn\u2019t have the revenue due to refunds for no play or discounted/free tickets and tickets only sold on the day (hard to plan for). 4 day tests would be more profitable in Aus and England but more critically the only way to make financial sense in other countries.\u201d My short response is that four-day Tests probably have their place. But to mandate them for the World Test Championship is a whole other thing. I get why New Zealand are keen on them, for example, given how infrequently they get to play. Indeed, take Bangladesh too who have been showed so little respect from Cricket Australia - not hosted for a Test since 2003 - maybe a pair of four-day fixtrues would get that over the line. Not that such bad behaviour should be rewarded. 90th over: England 266-9 (Pope 59, Anderson 4) Very good from Jimmy, getting the first ball of the day safely down to third man to give the strike to Pope. The young man makes solid contact with a drive to the man at cover to begin before flicking two confident runs through midwicket. Rabada goes short to Pope in response, who gets underneath it. To finish, he gets resourceful with a snuffle outside the leg stump to open up the offside, eventually hacking a quick single to square leg to keep the strike for the next over. They\u2019ve managed that really well. The players are on the field at Newlands. Right, how long can this final England pair drag it out? Jimmy Anderson is down at the business end to begin, facing Kagiso Rabaga. Never an easy task. He has a couple of slips and a gully. PLAY! Speaking of that Test in Sydney... look away now if you are triggered by news that Australia have found an out-and-out superstar number three batsman. Marnus Labuschagne took his overnight ton and made it a double. That\u2019s the fourth time in six Tests this home summer that\u2019s he has reached three figures. What a ride he has had since coming in for Steve Smith as a concussion sub at Lord\u2019s in August. Would you believe, now in his 22nd Test innings, he has the second highest average ever with only Bradman ahead of him. Yep - he\u2019s overtaken Steve Smith. In favour of four-day Test cricket? If so, you\u2019ll be happy to hear that Kevin Roberts, the Cricket Australia boss, was talking them up again on radio during the Australia v New Zealand Test overnight. To me, I regret to say, this is starting to feel like a done deal for the next World Test Championship cycle. What say you? It looks a stuning morning at Cape Town on the telly. Another great day to bat. Mark Ramprakash, who has been a revelation as a TV pundit on Sky since giving up the batting coaching gig - so measured, so soothing - is talking up Ollie Pope and I\u2019m all for that. Ben Stokes is now being interviewed pitchside. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to put my finger on,\u201d he says when expressing his frustration at England giving up their starts. He adds that he is fully fit for bowling duty today. Welcome to day two at Newlands. Just typing that venue name still gives me a mild cast of PTSD: the last time I was there I was commentating when Cam Bancroft shoved a square of sandpaper down his pants. But I digress. In Cape Town, you get one of the hardest and best tracks in the world to bat on. It\u2019s why Vic Marks said last night that the opening day was the type to make England\u2019s bowlers very cross. With the exception of Zak Crawley, all of England\u2019s specialist batsmen got into the game and reached at least 29, yet none made it beyond 47 with the exception of Ollie Pope, who resumes today on 56 with the visitors 262-9. It was a familiar tale, those wasted starts. The look on Ben Stokes\u2019 face said it all when he gave catching practice to cover after batting like a dream until three runs short of a half-century. They\u2019re now well behind the game and relying on the old firm of Anderson and Broad - along with a supporting cast of Curran, Stokes and Dom Bess (much more on him later) to get them out of jail on this second day. Before that, the hosts, excellent with the ball again yesterday - aren\u2019t they always? - have to end this frustrating tenth wicket stand, currently worth 28 between Pope and Jimmy Anderson. The former took to ramping by the close last night, such was his confidence. What they would give for even half an hour of additional, productive resistance this morning. We\u2019ll find out soon. Good morning to you all.",

Fonda, 82, a veteran of Vietnam-era activism who has been skirting arrest at weekly climate change protests close to the White House, joined an ad-hoc coalition of protest groups alarmed by US-Iranian tensions that have escalated since the Trump administration abandoned the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran three years ago. \u201cThe climate movement and the peace movement must be one movement,\u201d Fonda said, describing the US Department of Defense as the biggest institutional user of fossil fuels in the world. \u201cYoung people should know that all of the wars fought since you were born have been about oil,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been about oil, and it\u2019s killing people in the Middle East, and oil is killing us here, killing our climate, fires in Australia, we have to stop.

      "body": "<p>Every room in Lucy St George\u2019s north London home is a different size and shape. This suits the designer perfectly, because she\u2019s \u201calways been a fan of the one-off and the quirky\u201d. St George\u2019s love of the offbeat is the reason she co-founded <a href=\"https://www.rockettstgeorge.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Rockett St George</a> with business partner Jane Rockett, in 2007. Since then the homewares brand has acquired a reputation for witty pieces \u2013 flamingo-legged lamps, hand-shaped chairs \u2013 inspired by their vintage finds. \u201cWe\u2019ve always sold things we like: eccentric designs with personality.\u201d</p> <p>The home she shares with her two daughters feels out of the ordinary, too. Outside, it\u2019s a standard Edwardian terraced house: brick-fronted and bay-windowed, with stained-glass panels glowing in the wide front door. Inside, the look is Studio 54 with a bit of fin de si\u00e8cle excess. Surfaces gleam with gold and silver. Classical sculptures lurk among the waxy houseplants. A disco ball scatters sunbeams across the ceiling \u2013 like a blingy Jackson Pollock \u2013 in the afternoon: \u201cWe call it disco o\u2019clock.\u201d</p> <p>Before she moved in, St George says, she had stood at the bus stop outside for years, commuting to work. \u201cOne day I noticed a for sale sign so I thought I\u2019d have a look. It felt right. I believe in fate when it comes to homes.\u201d Exuberant is a polite way of describing its previous incarnation, as the last owner also had her own distinct style. A commotion of print and pattern filled the two-storey interior: \u201cThere were four different wall coverings, all beautiful but OTT. As we arrived to look around, people were flocking out, in shock.

      "bodyText": "Every room in Lucy St George\u2019s north London home is a different size and shape. This suits the designer perfectly, because she\u2019s \u201calways been a fan of the one-off and the quirky\u201d. St George\u2019s love of the offbeat is the reason she co-founded Rockett St George with business partner Jane Rockett, in 2007. Since then the homewares brand has acquired a reputation for witty pieces \u2013 flamingo-legged lamps, hand-shaped chairs \u2013 inspired by their vintage finds. \u201cWe\u2019ve always sold things we like: eccentric designs with personality.\u201d The home she shares with her two daughters feels out of the ordinary, too. Outside, it\u2019s a standard Edwardian terraced house: brick-fronted and bay-windowed, with stained-glass panels glowing in the wide front door. Inside, the look is Studio 54 with a bit of fin de si\u00e8cle excess. Surfaces gleam with gold and silver. Classical sculptures lurk among the waxy houseplants. A disco ball scatters sunbeams across the ceiling \u2013 like a blingy Jackson Pollock \u2013 in the afternoon: \u201cWe call it disco o\u2019clock.\u201d Before she moved in, St George says, she had stood at the bus stop outside for years, commuting to work. \u201cOne day I noticed a for sale sign so I thought I\u2019d have a look. It felt right. I believe in fate when it comes to homes.\u201d Exuberant is a polite way of describing its previous incarnation, as the last owner also had her own distinct style. A commotion of print and pattern filled the two-storey interior: \u201cThere were four different wall coverings, all beautiful but OTT. As we arrived to look around, people were flocking out, in shock. Some people didn\u2019t even make it upstairs.\u201d Squeezed into an end-of-terrace plot, the wedge-shaped house presented a challenge. \u201cBecause it\u2019s an awkward configuration it was a case of working out the best way to use each room.\u201d She began by knocking through three small rooms to create the eat-in kitchen.

If you\u2019re not a geek, this may suggest a columnist who has lost what remains of his marbles. But rest assured: I am not joking. The Pi is a fully functioning credit-card sized computer running a modern version of the Linux operating system. I bought it as a Christmas treat \u2013 and also as a project. The total cost \u2013 for the latest version, with 4GB of ram \u2013 was \u00a3114. For this, I got the highest-spec version of the motherboard, a keyboard and mouse, a micro-to-standard HDMI cable, a power supply, a case for the device, the official <em>Beginner\u2019s Guide</em><em> </em>and a micro SD card with the operating system on it.

First, the charitable <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/\" title=\"\">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> based on the project \u2013 which is supported by the Cambridge Computer Laboratory and Broadcom, the manufacturer of a key chip on the Pi board \u2013 has been funding the study of basic computer science in schools. This is vital because the new curriculum stretches the skill sets of many non-techie teachers. Second, by designing, manufacturing and supporting an exceedingly inexpensive device that children can learn to program, the Pi project makes it easier to ensure that as many kids as need a device can have one.

First, the charitable Raspberry Pi Foundation based on the project \u2013 which is supported by the Cambridge Computer Laboratory and Broadcom, the manufacturer of a key chip on the Pi board \u2013 has been funding the study of basic computer science in schools. This is vital because the new curriculum stretches the skill sets of many non-techie teachers. Second, by designing, manufacturing and supporting an exceedingly inexpensive device that children can learn to program, the Pi project makes it easier to ensure that as many kids as need a device can have one. (The cheapest version costs \u00a35.) The most important things children can learn from exposure to the Pi are that computers need not be incomprehensible black boxes, with \u201cno user-serviceable parts\u201d, and that software is not immutable hieroglyphics carved in stone by culturally impoverished elites in California or Shenzhen, but malleable stuff that can be tweaked to meet your needs rather than (as now happens) theirs. For kids whose choices will increasingly be limited to \u201cprogram or be programmed\u201d (as Douglas Rushkoff puts it), this is about as important an educational idea as one can imagine. And it\u2019s just one of many reasons for celebrating the realisation of such an inspiring British vision: a computer the size of a credit card. What I\u2019m reading Aye to AI \u201cOn the measure of intelligence\u201d is a profound (long) article on arXiv.org by Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, a prominent machine-learning expert, on future models of artificial intelligence, how we would define it, and what we might do next. Revolutionary On his terrific Marginal Revolution blog, the economist Tyler Cowen sets out a long list of questions well worth asking. Go, Rudy If you think Trump is crazy, talk to his lawyer, as New York magazine did in \u201cA conversation with Rudy Giuliani [right] over bloody marys at the Mark hotel\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cBe always at war with your vices, at peace with your neighbours, and let each new year find you a better man,\u201d wrote Benjamin Franklin, a lifelong advocate of self-improvement, in 1755.</p> <p>As 2020 kicks off, many of us will be taking a leaf out of Franklin\u2019s book. Unfortunately, many new year\u2019s resolutions are founded on wishful thinking rather than solid evidence, but psychological science can now offer some proved ways to boost your wellbeing.</p> <p>Based on a growing understanding of human emotions and the ways to control them, these techniques help us overcome bad habits, improve our relationships and manage our stress, so that we can all become better people in the coming year and decade.</p> <h2><strong>1. Differentiate your feelings</strong></h2> <p>To begin, take a moment to describe how you are feeling right now.</p> <p>Many people tend to use extremely broad terms \u2013 \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d \u2013 or use more specific terms interchangeably (\u201cangry\u201d is seen as a synonym for \u201cupset\u201d). Their feelings are a kind of fog. Others see something more like a rainbow with distinct shades: they are \u201cexcited\u201d or \u201cecstatic\u201d or they are \u201cirritated\u201d or \u201cfrustrated\u201d. \u201cThey are better at pinpointing exactly how they feel at a given moment,\u201d says Lisa Starr at the University of Rochester in New York.</p> <p>This is emotion differentiation and simply labelling our feelings in this way can help us to soften their impact. People with better emotion differentiation recover more quickly from stress and <a href=\"https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/embargo-teenagers-ability-to-describe-negative-emotions-protects-against-depression-384462/\" title=\"\">are at less risk of developing depression</a>. They are also less likely to become aggressive in frustrating situations and to self-medicate with alcohol when they are unhappy. This skill can even make us more rational, by helping us to account for the way our mood might be influencing our financial decisions, for example.</p> <p>Fortunately, emotion differentiation seems to improve with practice. So try to spend some time each day picking apart the many colours of your feelings and you may soon see benefits to your mind, body and relationships.</p> <h2><strong>2. Embrace your bad moods</strong></h2> <p>While labelling your emotions, you should also take note of your feelings about them. Suppose you are disappointed after a rejection. Do you accept those emotions for what they are? Or do you tell yourself that you \u201cshouldn\u2019t let it get to you\u201d and strive to remain cheerful?</p> <p>While it may seem healthy to talk yourself out of feeling bad, the research shows that the opposite is often true. Struggling against every negative emotion, and judging yourself for feeling them, can amplify their effects, reducing overall life satisfaction in the long term. People who take a more accepting attitude to those low points, as an inevitable part of life, tend to bounce back to greater overall happiness.</p> <p>Clearly, persistent low moods are a mental health issue that need serious attention, but the more transient storms are better weathered without further negative judgments. You might even consider the possibility that some negative feelings have a purpose: stress can actually boost things such as creativity and motivation, for example, and people who see the benefits of bad moods in this way tend to report better emotional wellbeing overall.</p> <h2><strong>3. Talk to yourself</strong></h2> <p>If you struggle to adopt that more dispassionate acceptance of the way you are feeling, you could also benefit from a technique known as psychological distancing.</p> <p>If I had an argument with a friend, for example, I might talk to myself in the third person (\u201cDavid was angry because\u2026\u201d) or imagine myself as a fly on the wall, observing the situation as an outsider. These simple techniques help us to adopt a more detached perspective, so that we can recognise and analyse our feelings without becoming too immersed in them.</p> <p>Research by Ethan Kross at the University of Michigan shows that <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721411408883\" title=\"\">these strategies</a> reduce impulsive and rash reactions, such as aggression, and accelerate the body\u2019s recovery from stress, while promoting more objective decision-making. Couples taught this strategy also have fewer arguments and show greater relationship satisfaction.</p> <h2><strong>4. Write</strong></h2> <p>If you are wrestling with a particularly upsetting experience, you can also try putting pen to paper, writing about the ways those feelings are affecting your life, your relationships and your hopes for the future.</p> <p>Abundant research shows that a few sessions of \u201cexpressive writing\u201d \u2013 ranging from 15 minutes to an hour \u2013 can boost people\u2019s emotional resilience to major upheavals or challenges, with lasting improvements to mood and physical health. People who have engaged in expressive writing are less likely to visit the doctor or take time off work in the weeks after the exercise.</p> <p>Prof James Pennebaker at the University of Texas at Austin, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691617707315\" title=\"\">who discovered the effect</a>, warns not to overdo it. \u201cMy recommendation has always been that if you are really upset about something, try writing \u2013 but only plan to write three or four times.\u201d For the best results, you might also try to practise the emotion differentiation or psychological distancing (writing the experience in the third person, say).

      "bodyText": "\u201cBe always at war with your vices, at peace with your neighbours, and let each new year find you a better man,\u201d wrote Benjamin Franklin, a lifelong advocate of self-improvement, in 1755. As 2020 kicks off, many of us will be taking a leaf out of Franklin\u2019s book. Unfortunately, many new year\u2019s resolutions are founded on wishful thinking rather than solid evidence, but psychological science can now offer some proved ways to boost your wellbeing. Based on a growing understanding of human emotions and the ways to control them, these techniques help us overcome bad habits, improve our relationships and manage our stress, so that we can all become better people in the coming year and decade. 1. Differentiate your feelings To begin, take a moment to describe how you are feeling right now. Many people tend to use extremely broad terms \u2013 \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d \u2013 or use more specific terms interchangeably (\u201cangry\u201d is seen as a synonym for \u201cupset\u201d). Their feelings are a kind of fog. Others see something more like a rainbow with distinct shades: they are \u201cexcited\u201d or \u201cecstatic\u201d or they are \u201cirritated\u201d or \u201cfrustrated\u201d. \u201cThey are better at pinpointing exactly how they feel at a given moment,\u201d says Lisa Starr at the University of Rochester in New York. This is emotion differentiation and simply labelling our feelings in this way can help us to soften their impact. People with better emotion differentiation recover more quickly from stress and are at less risk of developing depression. They are also less likely to become aggressive in frustrating situations and to self-medicate with alcohol when they are unhappy. This skill can even make us more rational, by helping us to account for the way our mood might be influencing our financial decisions, for example. Fortunately, emotion differentiation seems to improve with practice. So try to spend some time each day picking apart the many colours of your feelings and you may soon see benefits to your mind, body and relationships. 2. Embrace your bad moods While labelling your emotions, you should also take note of your feelings about them. Suppose you are disappointed after a rejection. Do you accept those emotions for what they are? Or do you tell yourself that you \u201cshouldn\u2019t let it get to you\u201d and strive to remain cheerful? While it may seem healthy to talk yourself out of feeling bad, the research shows that the opposite is often true. Struggling against every negative emotion, and judging yourself for feeling them, can amplify their effects, reducing overall life satisfaction in the long term. People who take a more accepting attitude to those low points, as an inevitable part of life, tend to bounce back to greater overall happiness. Clearly, persistent low moods are a mental health issue that need serious attention, but the more transient storms are better weathered without further negative judgments. You might even consider the possibility that some negative feelings have a purpose: stress can actually boost things such as creativity and motivation, for example, and people who see the benefits of bad moods in this way tend to report better emotional wellbeing overall. 3. Talk to yourself If you struggle to adopt that more dispassionate acceptance of the way you are feeling, you could also benefit from a technique known as psychological distancing. If I had an argument with a friend, for example, I might talk to myself in the third person (\u201cDavid was angry because\u2026\u201d) or imagine myself as a fly on the wall, observing the situation as an outsider. These simple techniques help us to adopt a more detached perspective, so that we can recognise and analyse our feelings without becoming too immersed in them. Research by Ethan Kross at the University of Michigan shows that these strategies reduce impulsive and rash reactions, such as aggression, and accelerate the body\u2019s recovery from stress, while promoting more objective decision-making. Couples taught this strategy also have fewer arguments and show greater relationship satisfaction. 4. Write If you are wrestling with a particularly upsetting experience, you can also try putting pen to paper, writing about the ways those feelings are affecting your life, your relationships and your hopes for the future. Abundant research shows that a few sessions of \u201cexpressive writing\u201d \u2013 ranging from 15 minutes to an hour \u2013 can boost people\u2019s emotional resilience to major upheavals or challenges, with lasting improvements to mood and physical health. People who have engaged in expressive writing are less likely to visit the doctor or take time off work in the weeks after the exercise. Prof James Pennebaker at the University of Texas at Austin, who discovered the effect, warns not to overdo it. \u201cMy recommendation has always been that if you are really upset about something, try writing \u2013 but only plan to write three or four times.\u201d For the best results, you might also try to practise the emotion differentiation or psychological distancing (writing the experience in the third person, say). This should help you to process the emotions and their meaning to you, without being overwhelmed by the bad feelings. 5. Adopt a new ritual You do not need to be religious or superstitious to benefit from small symbolic routines. A study by Prof Alison Wood Brooks at Harvard Business School, for instance, took a group of karaoke singers. Before their performance, the participants had to draw a self-portrait, sprinkle it with salt and then throw it in the bin. Although the ritual relied on no specific beliefs, the actions felt symbolic, the participants felt less anxious and were more accurate in their singing. Rituals can also boost our sense of self-control. Prof Allen Ding Tian at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, meanwhile, asked people to perform a series of rituals, such as sitting up straight, closing their eyes and counting to 10, before eating. He found that the actions, while apparently meaningless, led them to choose healthier foods. \u201cIt enhances individuals\u2019 subjective feelings of self-discipline,\u201d Tian says. We can be creative when we design our own rituals. It could be listening to a particular playlist before an important event or performing the same stretches as you get up in the morning, or repeating some mantras, any fixed, repetitive sequence of actions that leaves you feeling empowered and in control. 6. Drop your defences Sometimes, our desire for high self-esteem can be our own worst enemy, preventing us from making the very changes that would improve our lives. It can be bruising to realise that our own behaviour, like overeating or drinking too much alcohol, have been harming our bodies, for instance, and so we become defensive and deny there is a problem. Or at work we can reject useful feedback that would help us to improve, while the very fear of failure \u2013 and how it will reflect on us \u2013 can undermine our performance. In each case, a technique called self-affirmation can help, which involves reflecting on the many things of personal value to you beyond the particular issue at hand. You might reflect on your love of music, say, or your relationships with your family. By reminding yourself of the many facets of your personality, you should feel more secure in yourself and less threatened by negative feedback or failure in any one domain, increasing your chances of positive change. If we all took a bit more time to recognise our many existing qualities, then we might just find it easier to win those wars with our vices, to be at peace with our neighbours \u2013 and to be better people in the coming year and decade.

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Earlier, the coffins had been taken to the Kadhimiya shrine in northern Baghdad, where an even larger crowd wept and beat their chests and heads.

Over two years, 80 people died of acute malnutrition, half of them children, and 235 died in shelling or trying to escape, according to activist Amjad al-Maleh, another Madaya resident. \u201cThe Iranian militia didn\u2019t only starve us or kill us, they also displaced us from our homes so my happiness at the death of one of Iran\u2019s most prominent leaders is indescribable,\u201d said al-Maleh. \u201cThe Middle East is now a better place without this person.\u201d In Israel too, Suleimani\u2019s death was welcomed by many. He was a household name there, infamous for his role in the civil war in neighbouring Syria, and long regarded by the country\u2019s military and government as one of its biggest threats. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on the brink of war with the Iranians for a long time. It\u2019s better that we will start the war and not them,\u201d said Yshai Levy, 34, a software developer walking his dog nearby. \u201cSon of a dog, (Suleimani\u2019s) day came, and they eliminated him.\u201d Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been pushing Washington for years to take more aggressive action against Iran, and Israeli fighter jets have carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria, including against Iranian-backed forces. \u201cThey need to continue as much as needed and to eliminate them,\u201d said Neorai Cohen, 25, drinking at a bar in Jerusalem\u2019s covered market. But in Baghdad demonstrators who have been risking their lives on the streets for months, to push for greater democracy and protest at Iranian influence on Iraqi politics, warned that the death of Suleimani might just give his agenda a posthumous bolster. \u201cThis American attack came with the worst timing,\u201d said one of the leaders of the demonstration. \u201cThese militias were already calling us American agents to justify their attacks on us, and we fear they will use the assassination of Suleimani as a pretext to destroy our protest.\u201d Additional reporting by Hussein Akoush, Oliver Holmes and Quique Kierszenbaum",

The comedian Mark Smith tweeted the clip, and just like that, 2020 had its first viral moment, a meme that will endure, a default response to when it all gets too much. Feeling overwhelmed? Sharon.</p> <p>Sharon Stone, the world\u2019s most famous Sharon, at least up until the Great Sharon Quiz Debacle of January 2020, did her own bit for Sharon visibility last week.

It must be strange for Stone to have her own identity questioned in that way, but it must also be strange to encounter Sharon Stone on a dating app for normal people, the sensory equivalent of accidentally coming across an episode of <em>Friends y</em>ou\u2019ve never seen. Perhaps other users thought she was a Swedish climate change activist and author. \u201cHey Bumble, is being me exclusionary?\u201d she tweeted, a philosophical jumble for Bumble to unpack.</p> <p>The dating app attempted to handle the crisis with a matey message that borrowed the wacky tone of smoothie bottles and baby food sachets. It called her a queen, promised to unblock her, slightly passive-aggressively implied that she should have verified her profile, then added: \u201cCatherine Tramell from <em>Basic Instinct</em> gets a pass today!\u201d One has to wonder if anyone at Bumble has actually watched <em>Basic Instinct</em> or if they had simply scanned Stone\u2019s IMDB page. \u201cSerial killer gets a pass today!\u201d might not be the best PR strategy to adopt when your dating app has been unexpectedly endorsed by a celebrity and given a global profile boost of unprecedented magnitude.</p> <p>It\u2019s a blessing that they don\u2019t seem to have found an ice pick emoji.</p> <p>Stone herself was unmoved. \u201cYou are confusing my honesty with your fantasy,\u201d she replied, adding a clip of her acceptance speech for a <em>GQ</em> award in 2019, in which she explained how for a long time, the scene, that scene, in <em>Basic Instinct</em> had turned her into a joke. On the next <em>Celebrity Mastermind</em>, perhaps there should be a round on the movie star who defends her dignity and prefers to date like normal people. What\u2019s her name?

      "body": "<p>\u201cMost families have a kind of official family story,\u201d Vigdis Hjorth says. \u201c\u2018This is how we do Christmas\u2019, and so on. If one member does not share this official, nice story, there is a big tension. I think I have given a voice to that person who has a more complex story, who is not prepared to be part of it. The family won\u2019t listen to her, and there is a great deal of unpleasantness\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Hjorth, 60, is talking about her unsettling, beautifully constructed novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/22/will-and-testament-by-vigdis-hjorth-review\" title=\"\">Will and Testament</a></em>, in which a woman in her 50s, a magazine editor in Oslo, capsizes her family by insisting that her father sexually abused and raped her as a child. Because Bergljot, the narrator of the novel, shares many elements of Hjorth\u2019s own autobiography and because the first-person voice of the book is so directly and convincingly written, it has ignited the ongoing controversy in Norway over \u201c<em>virkelighetslitteratur</em>\u201d, or \u201creality fiction\u201d, and the ethics of using details of family history in novels.</p> <p>In this case, the \u201cunpleasantness\u201d in the novel has spilled spectacularly over into real life. Hjorth\u2019s sister, Helga, a human rights lawyer, responded to the book by writing a novel of her own, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/dec/05/autofiction-at-war-why-revenge-novels-are-taking-off-in-norway\" title=\"\">Fri Vilje</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/dec/05/autofiction-at-war-why-revenge-novels-are-taking-off-in-norway\" title=\"\"> (</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/dec/05/autofiction-at-war-why-revenge-novels-are-taking-off-in-norway\" title=\"\">Free Will</a>), in which a character suffers the trauma of living with the public fallout from a narcissistic sibling\u2019s \u201cdishonest\u201d autobiographical novel. Hjorth\u2019s mother, Inger, threatened legal action against a theatre in Bergen, which staged an adaptation of <em>Will and Testament</em>. The lawsuit demanded \u00a323,000 in compensation for every family member affected by the story.</p> <p>Hjorth, the author of 20 novels, was already a leading figure in contemporary Norwegian fiction, but because of the controversy, and because of the power of her book, she has lately become a kind of cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, winner of the Norwegian Booksellers\u2019 prize for this novel, and prime subject of newspaper editorials. One of the reasons for this is that her book emerged into a literary culture already polarised in its reaction to Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s intimately confessional novel sequence <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2018/sep/18/karl-ove-knausgaard-on-the-end-of-my-struggle-books-podcast\" title=\"\">My Struggle</a></em>, and its enormous international success. \u201cAutofiction\u201d \u2013 exploiting the rawest of intimacies of lovers and spouses \u2013 has come to seem a distinctly Norwegian export. To emphasise the point, I spoke to Hjorth in London after an event in which she had discussed on stage the porous bounds of literature and reality with Knausgaard\u2019s ex-wife, Linda Bostr\u00f6m Knausgaard, who has published a novel of her own, which appears to dispute her ex\u2019s fictional account of their break-up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is nothing like a neutral view. We start to read each other from the moment we meet. Fiction reveals that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the course of that earlier discussion, Hjorth had insisted repeatedly on the sanctity of fiction, the right of the author to both invent and to mine personal experience just as she sees fit. She had also read, in a compulsive, frenzied manner, from the translation of <em>Will and Testament</em>, bringing to life the internal drama of her narrator, Bergljot, who is trapped in the double bind of all accusers: desperate in her efforts to be believed, and dismissed for her desperation.</p> <p>I suggested to Hjorth afterwards that reading her book, listening to her speak, brought to mind that famous quote from the Polish writer Czeslaw Milosz: \u201cOnce a writer is born into a family, then the family is finished.\u201d Does she agree?</p> <p>She smiles. \u201cYou know, I think that if you write nicely about family life, then they say, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s us.\u2019 But if you don\u2019t write so nicely, then, \u2018That\u2019s not us!\u2019 It\u2019s not a secret that I don\u2019t have contact with my own family, but that has nothing at all to do with the novel.\u201d</p> <p>All the same, it is hard, sitting down with Hjorth, not to be tempted to go through the facts of the novel and to establish which might be \u201ctrue\u201d and which not. Like all persuasive fiction the book establishes such a credible interior world that it defies the idea of make-believe. Bergljot\u2019s recovered memory of abuse, which has surfaced in adulthood, is triggered by the last act of her father, which has been to bequeath the lakeside cabins in which the extended family enjoyed holidays to her sisters and not to her. All the buried trauma that has estranged her from the family is suddenly entirely and believably present.</p> <p>In one effort to equate reality with that fiction a Norwegian newspaper produced the funeral order of service of Hjorth\u2019s father to prove that it was reproduced almost verbatim in the book; Hjorth\u2019s sisters allege that she has lifted email correspondence directly for her novel. Hjorth herself will not go there.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t talk about my family.\u201d</p> <p>Because?</p> <p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she says, just about patiently, \u201cI\u2019m in enough trouble. And it doesn\u2019t concern the novel.\u201d If she were to write about her family directly one day, she says, she would \u201cwrite it as myself, and \u2013 as Knausgaard does \u2013 a crucial thing \u2013 use their real names.\u201d</p> <p>In the course of her earlier discussion she said that she started her novels with a particular urgent question she wanted to answer. What was the question this time?</p> <p>\u201cIt was \u2018What\u2019s the voice of a person like, when she or he has an important story that nobody wants to listen to?\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>For a number of years Hjorth has been working as a teacher in Norway with people who \u201chave no papers\u201d or who are refugees. \u201cOne example would be a mother, and the government has taken her three children,\u201d she says. \u201cThe mother had only one sentence when I met her: \u2018They took them \u2013 they came on Friday \u2013 they took the children, they took the children.\u2019 One sentence again and again, it just keeps going around.\u201d Some of that experience in helping to give such people the more measured and coherent voice to fight legal battles, fed into her construction of Bergljot, she says.</p> <p>The theme of her book \u2013 the need of a victim of abuse to be believed, whatever the consequences, and however circumstantial the evidence \u2013 obviously also comes at a moment when the culture demands that accusers be given that right. I haven\u2019t read any better fictional exploration of the implications of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo</a> than Hjorth\u2019s book, not least because of its clear-eyed honesty about unreliable narration. Bergljot is certain of the essential truth of her allegations, if not all of the facts. These admissions of doubt place the reader not only squarely in the mind of Bergljot, haunted by abuse, waging strategic conflict with her family, but also captures the impossible emotional difficulty of her siblings and mother, whose entire hold on reality has been jeopardised by the allegations.</p> <p>Because the voice of the novel circles around the nature of the crime, it becomes a convincing psychiatric case study, as well as a distinctly gossipy family drama. I ask Hjorth if she has had therapy over the years \u2013 Bergljot\u2019s voice sometimes sounds familiar with the consulting room.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says, \u201cI can be open about that.\u201d</p> <p>I ask how different the experience of writing fiction feels from that process of confessional.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very different,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause when you go to psychoanalysis, it\u2019s because you\u2019re in trouble and you want to live better. I don\u2019t have that kind of pain. When I write, I don\u2019t write to have less pain. So it\u2019s a very different process.\u201d</p> <p>But it seems somehow crucial to understanding how a mind like Bergljot\u2019s might work \u2013 she fears at one point, for example, a sort of reflexive self-indulgence in her allegations: \u201cAm I caressing my scar?\u201d she wonders\u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"69d56f233a3e49060e1d5d50f88f7d2acc55905a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69d56f233a3e49060e1d5d50f88f7d2acc55905a/37_467_3575_4467/800.jpg\" alt=\"Vigdis Hjorth\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You have to get rid of those lies even though you have survived by telling them to yourself\u2019: Vigdis Hjorth in her garden in Oslo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik Norrud/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat is interesting, when you go to see an analyst, you find out how many lies you have in your story about yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cOften you survive because you have these lies. But still, you have to get rid of those lies even though you have survived by telling them to yourself. And that\u2019s a painful process. I think that people who have been in psychoanalysis, they learn not to lie as much as they did before. So, like we are talking here now, my mind might be thinking \u2018Ah Vigdis, Is this right? Are you lying now? Is this how you like to see it? OK, be honest.\u2019 So you learn the technique of communicating with yourself.\u201d</p> <p>The difficulty for people with trauma like Bergljot\u2019s, Hjorth suggests, is that they become labelled by their victimhood and have to choose to resist or embrace \u201cmaking that their identity\u201d. Hjorth has lectured over the years on addiction and drinking culture \u2013 she is a lover of wine herself, she says, but knows when to stop \u2013 and has met many former alcoholics. \u201cThey have been sober for years and still when I meet them, they say: \u2018I\u2019m an alcoholic.\u2019 That\u2019s always a surprise to me. I\u2019m curious about that. \u2018Weren\u2019t you a father, a brother, an engineer, before you were that?\u2019\u201d Again, she insists, Bergljot\u2019s voice also grows out of that understanding as much as any more autobiographical impulse.</p> <p>We talk about Knausgaard, I wonder how she felt, as a writer and a reader, when she first engaged with his books.</p> <p>\u201cI love what he does,\u201d she says, \u201cthough it is hard to say what he is doing. All writing is black letters on paper, but this one moves me and I don\u2019t care about that one. Why is that? I would never imagine that I could be interested in reading about a man drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes, day in day out. But I was.\u201d</p> <p>I admit I don\u2019t know enough about Norwegian society, but I wonder if there is something in the expected surface of life \u2013 a sense of happy families perhaps \u2013 that makes the fictional deconstruction of books like hers and Knausgaard\u2019s, shocking, or taboo-breaking.</p> <p>She suggests that it is a long tradition in Norwegian fiction, particularly among female writers, to expose the darker realities of family life. \u201cI think literally the first sentence that Sigrid Undset, our Nobel prize winner wrote, in her first book was \u2018I have been unfaithful to my husband\u2019,\u201d she says, with a laugh. \u201cSo it was always there.\u201d The desire for truth-telling emerges, perhaps, from a particular sameness in Norwegian family life, she adds. \u201cI think in England for example the difference between rich and poor has always been big and especially now. And so there are lots of versions of family life. In Norway I think we are more equal generally. And I think when everyone is living the same way, people compare all the time. It makes them look from behind the curtains at their neighbours\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Her book is very different from Knausgaard\u2019s novels but one thing they seem to share is a meditation on a generational shift in masculine roles. <em>The Struggle</em> for Knausgaard is much to do with having to fill the endless hours caring for young children \u2013 a role his own father brutally abandoned. In Hjorth\u2019s book, obviously, the highly patriarchal society of the narrator\u2019s parents has a deeply sinister and problematic legacy. How conscious was she of that shift when she was writing this book?</p> <p>\u201cI was conscious of it. I think the family structure in Norway, more than probably anywhere in the world, has become as equal as it can be between women and men. And fathers, whether they like it or not, are forced to take an active role, having contact with their small children. Changing diapers, feeding them, dressing the little girl up to go to a birthday party. The fathers of Bergljot\u2019s generation never did that. And perhaps what happened to Bergljot was more common in that generation because fathers were not used to their daughters\u2019 bodies. I think perhaps it\u2019s much more difficult for a father who has been close to the body of the little girl to abuse her.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/dec/05/autofiction-at-war-why-revenge-novels-are-taking-off-in-norway\">Autofiction at war: why 'revenge novels' are taking off in Norway</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We return to those questions of truth and reality. For Hjorth it clearly is a family business. Her daughter, she says, is engaged in a PhD about the stories that are told in courtrooms, how they are constructed and how they are persuasive. Jurors and judges she suggests, are in this sense no different from readers and literary critics. \u201cYou know in a trial, four different people might give an account of events on a particular day, and the court eventually decides to choose one of them to believe.\u201d</p> <p>In this sense, too, we all obviously have a fundamental desire to be advocates for our own lives \u2013 and the novel dramatises that fact. In Hjorth\u2019s novel Bergljot behaves in some ways like a maverick lawyer, marshalling all her resources to destroy the family case. Each interaction becomes a potential cross-examination. \u201cI heard the email notification from my iPhone on the seat next to me,\u201d she notes, typically, of a message from her sister, \u201can act of war, was my guess\u2026\u201d</p> <p>I wonder what Hjorth made of her own sister\u2019s decision to respond in kind to her, as it were, with a novel. Did part of her admire that?</p> <p>\u201cIt was well written,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause [Helga] was angry and I think anger is good for writing. And for me it was very interesting of course.\u201d</p> <p>The truth of that book, however, is obviously no more objective than any work of art, but perhaps dictated by experience. Hjorth has a favourite story to illustrate her sense of that. \u201cAfter Picasso painted <em>Guernica</em>, his huge painting of the bombing of the town, one of Franco\u2019s generals happened to stand with him in front of the painting. The general said \u2018Did you do that?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 Picasso answered, \u2018you did.\u2019\u201d She finds it amazing that the idea of objective truth has persisted, when it comes to the perception of complex events. \u201cFiction is not true in the sense that journalism [tries to be true]\u201d she says. \u201cIt is true in another sense. There is nothing like a neutral view. We start to read each other from the moment we meet. Fiction reveals that. Knausgaard, for example, shows how his character meets the world\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Does she believe that any such thing as a straight report of events is possible?</p> <p>\u201cIt does not exist. It is all about choosing. I could write 10 fictions about this meeting we are having and you will maybe like one of them: \u2018Yes that was how it was.\u2019\u201d She smiles.

      "bodyText": "\u201cMost families have a kind of official family story,\u201d Vigdis Hjorth says. \u201c\u2018This is how we do Christmas\u2019, and so on. If one member does not share this official, nice story, there is a big tension. I think I have given a voice to that person who has a more complex story, who is not prepared to be part of it. The family won\u2019t listen to her, and there is a great deal of unpleasantness\u2026\u201d Hjorth, 60, is talking about her unsettling, beautifully constructed novel Will and Testament, in which a woman in her 50s, a magazine editor in Oslo, capsizes her family by insisting that her father sexually abused and raped her as a child. Because Bergljot, the narrator of the novel, shares many elements of Hjorth\u2019s own autobiography and because the first-person voice of the book is so directly and convincingly written, it has ignited the ongoing controversy in Norway over \u201cvirkelighetslitteratur\u201d, or \u201creality fiction\u201d, and the ethics of using details of family history in novels. In this case, the \u201cunpleasantness\u201d in the novel has spilled spectacularly over into real life. Hjorth\u2019s sister, Helga, a human rights lawyer, responded to the book by writing a novel of her own, Fri Vilje (Free Will), in which a character suffers the trauma of living with the public fallout from a narcissistic sibling\u2019s \u201cdishonest\u201d autobiographical novel. Hjorth\u2019s mother, Inger, threatened legal action against a theatre in Bergen, which staged an adaptation of Will and Testament. The lawsuit demanded \u00a323,000 in compensation for every family member affected by the story. Hjorth, the author of 20 novels, was already a leading figure in contemporary Norwegian fiction, but because of the controversy, and because of the power of her book, she has lately become a kind of cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, winner of the Norwegian Booksellers\u2019 prize for this novel, and prime subject of newspaper editorials. One of the reasons for this is that her book emerged into a literary culture already polarised in its reaction to Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s intimately confessional novel sequence My Struggle, and its enormous international success. \u201cAutofiction\u201d \u2013 exploiting the rawest of intimacies of lovers and spouses \u2013 has come to seem a distinctly Norwegian export. To emphasise the point, I spoke to Hjorth in London after an event in which she had discussed on stage the porous bounds of literature and reality with Knausgaard\u2019s ex-wife, Linda Bostr\u00f6m Knausgaard, who has published a novel of her own, which appears to dispute her ex\u2019s fictional account of their break-up. In the course of that earlier discussion, Hjorth had insisted repeatedly on the sanctity of fiction, the right of the author to both invent and to mine personal experience just as she sees fit. She had also read, in a compulsive, frenzied manner, from the translation of Will and Testament, bringing to life the internal drama of her narrator, Bergljot, who is trapped in the double bind of all accusers: desperate in her efforts to be believed, and dismissed for her desperation. I suggested to Hjorth afterwards that reading her book, listening to her speak, brought to mind that famous quote from the Polish writer Czeslaw Milosz: \u201cOnce a writer is born into a family, then the family is finished.\u201d Does she agree? She smiles. \u201cYou know, I think that if you write nicely about family life, then they say, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s us.\u2019 But if you don\u2019t write so nicely, then, \u2018That\u2019s not us!\u2019 It\u2019s not a secret that I don\u2019t have contact with my own family, but that has nothing at all to do with the novel.\u201d All the same, it is hard, sitting down with Hjorth, not to be tempted to go through the facts of the novel and to establish which might be \u201ctrue\u201d and which not. Like all persuasive fiction the book establishes such a credible interior world that it defies the idea of make-believe. Bergljot\u2019s recovered memory of abuse, which has surfaced in adulthood, is triggered by the last act of her father, which has been to bequeath the lakeside cabins in which the extended family enjoyed holidays to her sisters and not to her. All the buried trauma that has estranged her from the family is suddenly entirely and believably present. In one effort to equate reality with that fiction a Norwegian newspaper produced the funeral order of service of Hjorth\u2019s father to prove that it was reproduced almost verbatim in the book; Hjorth\u2019s sisters allege that she has lifted email correspondence directly for her novel. Hjorth herself will not go there. \u201cI won\u2019t talk about my family.\u201d Because? \u201cBecause,\u201d she says, just about patiently, \u201cI\u2019m in enough trouble. And it doesn\u2019t concern the novel.\u201d If she were to write about her family directly one day, she says, she would \u201cwrite it as myself, and \u2013 as Knausgaard does \u2013 a crucial thing \u2013 use their real names.\u201d In the course of her earlier discussion she said that she started her novels with a particular urgent question she wanted to answer. What was the question this time? \u201cIt was \u2018What\u2019s the voice of a person like, when she or he has an important story that nobody wants to listen to?\u2019\u201d she says. For a number of years Hjorth has been working as a teacher in Norway with people who \u201chave no papers\u201d or who are refugees. \u201cOne example would be a mother, and the government has taken her three children,\u201d she says. \u201cThe mother had only one sentence when I met her: \u2018They took them \u2013 they came on Friday \u2013 they took the children, they took the children.\u2019 One sentence again and again, it just keeps going around.\u201d Some of that experience in helping to give such people the more measured and coherent voice to fight legal battles, fed into her construction of Bergljot, she says. The theme of her book \u2013 the need of a victim of abuse to be believed, whatever the consequences, and however circumstantial the evidence \u2013 obviously also comes at a moment when the culture demands that accusers be given that right. I haven\u2019t read any better fictional exploration of the implications of #MeToo than Hjorth\u2019s book, not least because of its clear-eyed honesty about unreliable narration. Bergljot is certain of the essential truth of her allegations, if not all of the facts. These admissions of doubt place the reader not only squarely in the mind of Bergljot, haunted by abuse, waging strategic conflict with her family, but also captures the impossible emotional difficulty of her siblings and mother, whose entire hold on reality has been jeopardised by the allegations. Because the voice of the novel circles around the nature of the crime, it becomes a convincing psychiatric case study, as well as a distinctly gossipy family drama. I ask Hjorth if she has had therapy over the years \u2013 Bergljot\u2019s voice sometimes sounds familiar with the consulting room. \u201cYes,\u201d she says, \u201cI can be open about that.\u201d I ask how different the experience of writing fiction feels from that process of confessional. \u201cIt\u2019s very different,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause when you go to psychoanalysis, it\u2019s because you\u2019re in trouble and you want to live better. I don\u2019t have that kind of pain. When I write, I don\u2019t write to have less pain. So it\u2019s a very different process.\u201d But it seems somehow crucial to understanding how a mind like Bergljot\u2019s might work \u2013 she fears at one point, for example, a sort of reflexive self-indulgence in her allegations: \u201cAm I caressing my scar?\u201d she wonders\u2026 \u201cWhat is interesting, when you go to see an analyst, you find out how many lies you have in your story about yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cOften you survive because you have these lies. But still, you have to get rid of those lies even though you have survived by telling them to yourself. And that\u2019s a painful process. I think that people who have been in psychoanalysis, they learn not to lie as much as they did before. So, like we are talking here now, my mind might be thinking \u2018Ah Vigdis, Is this right? Are you lying now? Is this how you like to see it? OK, be honest.\u2019 So you learn the technique of communicating with yourself.\u201d The difficulty for people with trauma like Bergljot\u2019s, Hjorth suggests, is that they become labelled by their victimhood and have to choose to resist or embrace \u201cmaking that their identity\u201d. Hjorth has lectured over the years on addiction and drinking culture \u2013 she is a lover of wine herself, she says, but knows when to stop \u2013 and has met many former alcoholics. \u201cThey have been sober for years and still when I meet them, they say: \u2018I\u2019m an alcoholic.\u2019 That\u2019s always a surprise to me. I\u2019m curious about that. \u2018Weren\u2019t you a father, a brother, an engineer, before you were that?\u2019\u201d Again, she insists, Bergljot\u2019s voice also grows out of that understanding as much as any more autobiographical impulse. We talk about Knausgaard, I wonder how she felt, as a writer and a reader, when she first engaged with his books. \u201cI love what he does,\u201d she says, \u201cthough it is hard to say what he is doing. All writing is black letters on paper, but this one moves me and I don\u2019t care about that one. Why is that? I would never imagine that I could be interested in reading about a man drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes, day in day out. But I was.\u201d I admit I don\u2019t know enough about Norwegian society, but I wonder if there is something in the expected surface of life \u2013 a sense of happy families perhaps \u2013 that makes the fictional deconstruction of books like hers and Knausgaard\u2019s, shocking, or taboo-breaking. She suggests that it is a long tradition in Norwegian fiction, particularly among female writers, to expose the darker realities of family life. \u201cI think literally the first sentence that Sigrid Undset, our Nobel prize winner wrote, in her first book was \u2018I have been unfaithful to my husband\u2019,\u201d she says, with a laugh. \u201cSo it was always there.\u201d The desire for truth-telling emerges, perhaps, from a particular sameness in Norwegian family life, she adds. \u201cI think in England for example the difference between rich and poor has always been big and especially now. And so there are lots of versions of family life. In Norway I think we are more equal generally. And I think when everyone is living the same way, people compare all the time. It makes them look from behind the curtains at their neighbours\u2026\u201d Her book is very different from Knausgaard\u2019s novels but one thing they seem to share is a meditation on a generational shift in masculine roles. The Struggle for Knausgaard is much to do with having to fill the endless hours caring for young children \u2013 a role his own father brutally abandoned. In Hjorth\u2019s book, obviously, the highly patriarchal society of the narrator\u2019s parents has a deeply sinister and problematic legacy. How conscious was she of that shift when she was writing this book? \u201cI was conscious of it. I think the family structure in Norway, more than probably anywhere in the world, has become as equal as it can be between women and men. And fathers, whether they like it or not, are forced to take an active role, having contact with their small children. Changing diapers, feeding them, dressing the little girl up to go to a birthday party. The fathers of Bergljot\u2019s generation never did that. And perhaps what happened to Bergljot was more common in that generation because fathers were not used to their daughters\u2019 bodies. I think perhaps it\u2019s much more difficult for a father who has been close to the body of the little girl to abuse her.\u201d We return to those questions of truth and reality. For Hjorth it clearly is a family business. Her daughter, she says, is engaged in a PhD about the stories that are told in courtrooms, how they are constructed and how they are persuasive. Jurors and judges she suggests, are in this sense no different from readers and literary critics. \u201cYou know in a trial, four different people might give an account of events on a particular day, and the court eventually decides to choose one of them to believe.\u201d In this sense, too, we all obviously have a fundamental desire to be advocates for our own lives \u2013 and the novel dramatises that fact. In Hjorth\u2019s novel Bergljot behaves in some ways like a maverick lawyer, marshalling all her resources to destroy the family case. Each interaction becomes a potential cross-examination. \u201cI heard the email notification from my iPhone on the seat next to me,\u201d she notes, typically, of a message from her sister, \u201can act of war, was my guess\u2026\u201d I wonder what Hjorth made of her own sister\u2019s decision to respond in kind to her, as it were, with a novel. Did part of her admire that? \u201cIt was well written,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause [Helga] was angry and I think anger is good for writing. And for me it was very interesting of course.\u201d The truth of that book, however, is obviously no more objective than any work of art, but perhaps dictated by experience. Hjorth has a favourite story to illustrate her sense of that. \u201cAfter Picasso painted Guernica, his huge painting of the bombing of the town, one of Franco\u2019s generals happened to stand with him in front of the painting. The general said \u2018Did you do that?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 Picasso answered, \u2018you did.\u2019\u201d She finds it amazing that the idea of objective truth has persisted, when it comes to the perception of complex events. \u201cFiction is not true in the sense that journalism [tries to be true]\u201d she says. \u201cIt is true in another sense. There is nothing like a neutral view. We start to read each other from the moment we meet. Fiction reveals that. Knausgaard, for example, shows how his character meets the world\u2026\u201d Does she believe that any such thing as a straight report of events is possible? \u201cIt does not exist. It is all about choosing. I could write 10 fictions about this meeting we are having and you will maybe like one of them: \u2018Yes that was how it was.\u2019\u201d She smiles. Which seems as good a place as any to end. \u2022 Will and Testament is published by Verso \u00a310.99. To order it for \u00a39.67 go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.

Newcastle might be struggling in the Premier League right now, having lost three of their last four matches, but the Dale have lost three of their last four too, and those in League One.

Goliath might not be that confident when he comes to town. And any trepidation they feel will surely be ramped up when they remember Rochdale\u2019s brave performance at Old Trafford four months ago - they held Manchester United to a 1-1 draw in the League Cup before going out on penalties - and the Dale\u2019s 2-2 draw with Spurs in the fifth round of this competition back in 2018.

      "bodyText": "Jamie Jackson was on point at Spotland. Here\u2019s his take on a fluctuating and very entertaining cup tie. Click, enjoy ... and thanks for reading this MBM. Steve Bruce adds: \u201cHow good we were in the first half, in the second we were disappointing. We should have been out of sight, and therein lies our big problem. We don\u2019t score often enough. And if you don\u2019t take your chances, this can happen in the cup. The loss of Almiron and Muto took the edge off us, but in my opinion we should have been out of sight. We have to take our chances and improve in that area. But we\u2019re still in the cup, we\u2019ll still be in the hat. It\u2019s the FA Cup, and we\u2019ll take it seriously.\u201d Rochdale boss Brian Barry-Murphy talks to BT Sport! \u201cIt\u2019s relief, really ... the first half was a tough watch for us and our supporters ... but we fully expressed ourselves in the second half, it was hugely satisfying. We were overrun in the first half, and the lads showed great courage to put that right. We relish the cup and we\u2019re ecstatic for this to continue. It\u2019s huge for the club and can only help us going forward.\u201d This won\u2019t enter the pantheon of great upsets ... not yet, at least. While we wait for the match report to drop (and to see what the managers have to say) why not test your knowledge of shocks past? Ollie Rathbone spurned two great chances, but he shouldn\u2019t be too hard on himself. He was quite superb in the second half, the beating heart of Rochdale\u2019s fine comeback. Man of the match, surely, though the official decision has gone to goalscoring hero Aaron Wilbraham. Here\u2019s Rathbone, speaking to BT Sport: \u201cThe chance I had before the goal was a good save. The second one I rushed a bit. So it\u2019s disappointing in that respect. But it\u2019s a great opportunity to go to St James\u2019. We\u2019ve had a great trip to Old Trafford earlier this season, and we can be proud of our performance. It\u2019ll be amazing. A huge incentive. We take the competition really seriously, so it\u2019s all to play for in the second leg!\u201d Everyone back to St James\u2019 Park, then. That was a cracking cup tie! Newcastle were utterly dominant in the first half; Rochdale really should have turned it round in the second. They carved out enough chances to win. But they\u2019ll take a deserved draw. Spotland hail their heroes. 90 min +2: Still, a lucrative trip up north for a replay isn\u2019t to be sniffed at. It\u2019s the least Rochdale deserve. 90 min +1: There will be three added minutes. Rochdale should be holding onto a lead; Rathbone has spurned two gilt-edged invitations to score. 90 min: The set piece is half cleared by Atsu. But the ball\u2019s sent straight back at Newcastle. Atsu tries to chest down, and gets it all wrong, allowing O\u2019Connell to race off down the right! He enters the box and rolls across for Rathbone on the Spotland spot. He has to hit the target, surely, but wafts a weak sidefoot wide left of goal. Newcastle were on the brink of ignominious defeat, right there. 89 min: Wilbraham and Henderson make nuisances of themselves out on the left. Fernandez comes sliding in on the latter, and this is a free kick in a very dangerous position. 88 min: O\u2019Connell and Fernandez compete as the corner\u2019s swung with great purpose towards the near post. Goal kick, though Rochdale wanted another corner. Then Newcastle fly up the other end, Ki fizzing a rising shot towards the top left from some way out on the right. It\u2019s not too far away. 87 min: Rathbone, who has been Rochdale\u2019s star man, bustles to win a corner down the left. Rochdale load the box. The six-yard box. 86 min: Matty Longstaff lashes a 25-yarder wide left of goal. Not sure Sanchez would have got to that, had it been on target. This is such an entertaining cup tie! 84 min: From the corner, Ritchie hooks in from the right. At the far post, Fernandez flashes a header across the face of goal. There\u2019s nobody there to run it home for the Toon! Then Rochdale burst up the other end, Henderson nearly reaching a loose ball in the middle of the park. If he\u2019d got that under control, he\u2019d have been away down the middle, clear on goal. Anything could happen here! 83 min: Atsu has a whack from 25 yards. His shot takes a wild deflection and nearly loops over Sanchez. Just over the bar. A corner. Newcastle load the box, desperate to avoid a replay. Desperate not to get knocked out. 81 min: That was almost a carbon copy of the move that led to the chance Rathbone missed. One obvious difference, eh. Wilbraham scores on his 674th senior appearance. And credit to the manager Brian Barry-Murphy, because his three subs combined to create that equaliser. Rochdale deserve to be level. McLaughlin slips a ball down the inside-right channel for Matheson, who reaches the byline and cuts back for Wilbraham. The 40-year-old takes a touch and calmly pokes into the bottom right, giving Dubravka no chance! This had been coming! 78 min: Rochdale are asking Newcastle a few questions now. Wilbraham puts himself about under a long ball, forcing Hayden into a panicked clearance. Then Ryan probes down the left, but his cross is too close to Dubravka, who claims at the near post. 77 min: Newcastle re-establish a level of control by knocking it around the back for a bit. Then a ball\u2019s pinged down the inside-right channel for Joelinton to chase, but Sanchez is wise to the danger and comes off his line to gather calmly. 75 min: Rochdale struggled to retain possession in the first half. They\u2019ve been much better in the second. Now they\u2019re stroking it around in the middle of the park, as Newcastle sit back, holding on to what they\u2019ve got. 73 min: The resulting corner isn\u2019t anything to write home about. What a run by Matheson that was, though. The 17-year-old is a player in the making. 72 min: Matheson, the hero of Old Trafford, holds off Atsu and bursts into the Newcastle box on the right. He cuts back for Rathbone, who takes a cute touch to tee himself up, six yards out. He must score ... but in attempting to slot into the bottom right, hits Dubravka\u2019s leg. Corner. Rathbone slides across the turf, on his knees, head in hands. He knows that was a huge chance to equalise. 71 min: Yedlin tears down the right, as he did so often in the first half, but with less frequency in this second period. He makes himself plenty of time and space, burning past Rathbone, but hoicks his cross into the stand behind. 69 min: Rochdale make their last swap, replacing Stephen Dooley with Ryan McLaughlin. 68 min: Ryan bustles to earn a corner out on the left. Camps meets the set piece, onlyt to shank his volley horribly. Newcastle should really have wrapped this up by now, but Rochdale are still very much in this match. 66 min: Krafth loops a cross in from the right. It nearly confuses Sanchez, who scrambles back and catches on the line. Just in the nick of time. That was going into the top left. 65 min: Ritchie is in the thick of it immediately, racing down the left and pulling back for Ki, whose measured first-time sidefoot towards the bottom left looks to have wrong-footed Sanchez ... but is blocked by a defender just in time. 64 min: The resulting corner comes to nothing, but the Newcastle fans are in fine voice anyway, as they welcome the return from injury of Matt Ritchie. He comes on for the goalscorer Miguel Almiron. 63 min: Now Newcastle hit the post! Joelinton meets Atsu\u2019s left-wing cross, sending a header towards the top left. Sanchez gets a fingertip to it, and the ball grazes the outside of the goalframe. 62 min: So Newcastle, rather cleverly, slow the pace down by stroking it around the midfield. Great game management. As the volume decreases, Rathbone goes in rashly on Yedlin and becomes the first name in the referee\u2019s pristine notebook. 61 min: Spotland is bouncing again. We have ourselves a cup tie. 59 min: Rochdale hit the post! Rathbone has another dig from distance, sending a dribbler towards the bottom left from the edge of the box. Dubravka makes a meal of saving, pushing the ball out to Henderson, who takes a shot from a very tight angle on the left. His effort caroms off the woodwork. So close! The crowd respond, knowing their team, having been put through the mill for the most part, are still in this! 58 min: The ball drops near Sean Longstaff, out on the right wing. The older Longstaff brother attempts to launch a dipping, Le Tissieresque volley into the top left. It sails wide left, but full marks for ambition. 56 min: And here\u2019s some more proof, as Rathbone executes a lovely stepover as he makes his way down the inside-left channel, before pearling a rising shot towards the top left. Dubravka is forced to parry at full stretch, a fine save to match the quality of the strike. 55 min: Camps, Dooley and Rathbone combine cutely down the inside-left channel, pinging the ball around in pretty triangles with both foot and head. But Newcastle hold firm on the edge of their area, and the move goes no further. Welcome proof that Rochdale can play some football when they get themselves going. 54 min: Muto can\u2019t continue. He limps off, to be replaced by Ki Sung-yueng. The corner, when eventually taken, is a complete non-event. 52 min: Almiron wins another corner down the right. Before it cam be taken, Muto goes down. He appears to have a problem with his right hip. 50 min: The corner on the left leads to a corner on the right. Almiron whips another vicious ball in. It\u2019s half cleared. Krafth is clumsily bundled over by Wilbraham, and the pair square up, but the manbag session is over quickly enough as the referee reminds both players that they\u2019re grown men. No free kick for Newcastle, as the flag had already gone up for offside. 49 min: Almiron takes. He looks to whip one across Sanchez and into the top left, but the keeper sticks out a strong hand. Atsu picks up possession on the other flank and wins a corner off Matheson. 48 min: A free kick for Newcastle out on the right. Sean Longstaff launches it into the box; Williams clears it easily enough. But it\u2019s still not sticking up front for Rochdale, and the ball\u2019s soon coming back towards their area. Yedlin skates down the right and is upended by Rathbone. Another free kick coming up, in a very dangerous position just to the right of the Rochdale box. 47 min: Newcastle pick up where they left off, pretty much. Sean Longstaff slips a pass down the right for Yedlin, once more in acres of space. The cross isn\u2019t all that good, and O\u2019Connell, so often on point, clears again. It\u2019s the second half! Rochdale get the party restarted. They\u2019ve made a second change, replacing 16-year-old Kwadwo Baah with 40-year-old Aaron Wilbraham. A 24-year age gap! By the way, it\u2019s still raining. Some more half-time entertainment. \u201cAny time I see the name Rochdale it delights my inner revolutionary,\u201d begins our old pal Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cYou see, back in the 1960s the University of Toronto unveiled an 18-floor dormitory called Rochdale College. It rapidly and notoriously became known as the hippie heart of Canada. If you happen to notice any bong passing, guitar strumming, free-love loving in the stands today, it will be good to know the tradition lives on. Mind you, with the injury plight and Mike Ashley to deal with, it might be Steve Bruce in need of a night of pipe, song and sex.\u201d Legal disclaimer: the Guardian accepts no responsibility for the workings, however harrowing, of your mind\u2019s eye. Half-time entertainment. This is magical. Hey, the FA Cup is magical. Enjoy, enjoy! Just the one goal in it at the break ... though Rochdale have Sanchez to thank for that, as the keeper makes a fine double save just before the whistle. Joelinton swivels on the penalty spot and dribbles a shot towards the bottom right. Sanchez stops. Yedlin tries to slam the rebound in from a tight angle on the right, but the keeper\u2019s all over that too. Rochdale will need to make some half-time changes, because Newcastle are getting lots of joy on both flanks, and a one-goal lead is the least the six-time winners deserve. 45 min: Yedlin shakes his hips and sits down Keohane. He shimmies into the box and dinks a cross towards Muto, but the delivery isn\u2019t in the same class as the run. Rochdale clear. 43 min: This is a little better from Rochdale, as Rathbone embarks on a rococo ramble down the inside-left channel, Krafth and Fernandez both unwilling to tackle him as he enters the box. But Rathbone\u2019s close control lets him down, just as it looks like he\u2019s opened up a little channel to cross. A little promise to take into the second half, perhaps. 42 min: Camps tries to stir the crowd by shooting from 30 yards. The ball dribbles apologetically wide of the right-hand post. Dubravka wanders over to watch its serene progress. 41 min: Newcastle have done an excellent job of silencing the home crowd. The atmosphere was bubbling at kick-off, but it\u2019s eerily calm now. 39 min: Yedlin bursts into the box from the right. He\u2019s got the opportunity to shoot from a tight angle, but unselfishly opts to tee up Muto on the penalty spot instead. Muto smacks his shot straight at Sanchez when he really should score ... but then take nothing away from the keeper\u2019s brave stop. Newcastle would have been worth a two-goal lead, but Rochdale are hanging on in there. 38 min: O\u2019Connell looks for the Beckenbauer inside, and sashays up the middle of the park. It\u2019s a fine run, spoilt only by the pass he then clumps into the stand out on the right, while attempting to release Ryan on the wing. 36 min: Newcastle continue to dominate possession. They\u2019re in a patient mood right now, stroking it about, hither and yon, happy to wait for an opening to present itself. Eventually Atsu tries to reach the byline on the left for the 300th time this afternoon, but Matheson gets in the road and ushers the ball out for a goal kick. 34 min: A corner for Newcastle out on the right. Sanchez claims it, but knackers himself by clattering into the newly arrived Matheson as he leaps. After a brief period of medical attention, he\u2019s good to go again. 32 min: Magloire has been run ragged in the right-back position, and he\u2019s replaced by Luke Matheson, who you will remember as a 16-year-old scorer at Old Trafford back in September. Matheson went back to school the day after momentarily stunning Manchester United in the League Cup. He\u2019s 17 now. All grown up. 30 min: Joelinton\u2019s not hiding, to be fair, despite his dismal scoring record. Hayden knocks one in from the left; Newcastle\u2019s number nine rises under severe pressure from O\u2019Connell and Sanchez, winning a header but sending it over. 29 min: Atsu is burning it up down the left, but Yedlin isn\u2019t doing too badly out on the other flank. He drops a shoulder to win a corner. Almiron\u2019s set piece nearly finds Hayden, but Rathbone does enough to relieve the pressure. 27 min: Newcastle continue to ping it around in a progressive style. It\u2019s an open and entertaining match, though the visitors are experiencing the lion\u2019s share of the fun. Very much so. They\u2019ve hogged 74% of possession so far. 25 min: Long-distance efforts at either end. First Rathbone has a pop from distance; it flies harmlessly high and wide. Then Matty Longstaff has another dig, but this one deflects off his own man and out for a goal kick. 23 min: 2019 wasn\u2019t Joelinton\u2019s year. Will 2020 be better? On the evidence so far, possibly ... possibly not. He embarks on a glorious swerving run down the middle of the park, sending Williams off to the shops for the paper and 20 Bensons. He\u2019s just got Sanchez to beat! So far, so good. Then he opens his body to sidefoot into the bottom left ... and rolls the ball dismally wide, bothering only a nearby ballboy. Shame, because that was a fine run. 22 min: More space for Atsu, who has the run of Spotland this lunchtime. He lifts a cross into the middle, hoping to find Joelinton, but Sanchez claims. Rochdale are struggling to retain possession. 20 min: Now it\u2019s the Newcastle end in full voice. Blaydon Races. Oh me lads. Newcastle fully deserve this lead, they\u2019ve been marvellous so far. It had been coming, and it\u2019s right that it\u2019s the excellent Atsu who sets it up. He romps down the left yet again, cuts back yet again, and Almiron is on hand to whip a glorious shot into the roof of the net from 12 yards. 16 min: The Rochdale fans launch into a hearty chorus of the English folk standard Robbie Savage Is A Wanker. It\u2019s usually the sort of thing the TV technicians turn down, but this time, for some reason, BT Sport don\u2019t bother. Full Dolby surround sound, turned up to 11. Once more with feeling. 15 min: Yedlin drops a shoulder to skate past Keohane down the right, and should do better with his cross upon reaching the box. Rochdale clear, but it\u2019s beginning to look like a matter of time before Newcastle score the opener. 14 min: Atsu is getting all sorts of room down the left. He reaches the white line and pulls back for Matty Longstaff, who takes a touch and sees his eventual shot deflected over the bar by the alert O\u2019Connell. The resulting corner comes to nothing. 12 min: Yedlin crosses from the right, having been sent skittering down the wing by Sean Longstaff. His low cross is intercepted and hoicked clear by O\u2019Connell, with Joelinton lurking. Newcastle are showing plenty of menace in these opening exchanges. 10 min: Hayden swings a cross in from a tight spot out on the left. It\u2019s a decent ball, met by Joelinton\u2019s header. Newcastle\u2019s number nine aims for the top left, but doesn\u2019t quite get enough purchase on the effort. But the Toon are soon coming straight back at Rochdale, Atsu again reaching the byline on the left and cutting back for Joelinton, who still can\u2019t add to his season\u2019s haul of one goal. 8 min: Rochdale get their attack going for the first time this afternoon. Camps makes his way down the left and scoops inside for Henderson, who hooks a harmless effort well wide right from the edge of the box. 7 min: Krafth channels his inner Trent Alexander-Arnold, spraying a gloriously ambitious right-to-left pass towards Atsu on the left wing. Atsu reaches the byline and cuts back. The ball breaks right to Krafth, who had kept on trucking. Krafth\u2019s looping cross is snaffled by Sanchez. But that move was both pretty and dangerous. Nice football from Newcastle. 5 min: Atsu wins the second corner of the match, bursting down the left and playing the ball off Magloire. Sean Longstaff tries again, and this delivery isn\u2019t much better, easy pickings for Sanchez. 4 min: Yedlin rolls a cute pass across the face of the Rochdale box in the hope of teeing up Matty Longstaff. Camps nips in to block and clear before the renowned Manchester United botherer is able to take a whack on goal. 3 min: Sean Longstaff takes a short one, and makes an awful balls of it. After Newcastle noodle about in the futile style, Rochdale clear their lines. 2 min: Early signs that Newcastle aren\u2019t in the mood to hang about. Almiron turns on the jets and bustles down the left, winning the first corner of the game. And we\u2019re off! Wolverhampton Wanderers Newcastle United get the ball rolling, to great cheers. The visitors stroke it around the back awhile. Krafth launches it long for Joelinton, but the ball sails harmlessly through to Sanchez in the Rochdale goal. The weather is miserable. Rainy and cold. Greater Manchester in winter. But it\u2019s not dampening the spirits of a packed Spotland. A cracking third-round atmosphere, exactly as it should be. Out come the teams, with the hosts wearing their blue and black striped tops. Newcastle are in third-choice old gold with black trim, the spit of Wolves. A classic look, even if it\u2019s not theirs. We\u2019ll be off in a minute ... one minute later than usual. Heads up. Steve Bruce talks to BT Sport. \u201cNewcastle\u2019s recent history isn\u2019t great reading. We want to have a cup run, if we can, so why not? I experienced it a few years ago at Hull. The first thing to do is get over today. There\u2019s a couple of kids on the bench, but the team selection has been pretty easy because we are where we are, and we\u2019ve got what we\u2019ve got. Let\u2019s hope we\u2019ve got enough today. Everybody loves an underdog, that\u2019s why the TV cameras are here. But that\u2019s why the FA Cup is the competition it is.\u201d Some pre-match reading. Paul Wilson talks to Rochdale manager Brian Barry-Murphy. Rochdale are just four points above the relegation places in League One. But they won their last match, 2-1 at Accrington, and make only one change to their starting XI. MJ Williams comes in for the injured Paul McShane. (Does anybody else have this earworm?) Newcastle are missing Jamaal Lascelles, Allan Saint-Maximin, Jonjo Shelvey, Jetro Willems, Fabian Schar, Javier Manquillo, Paul Dummett and Andy Carroll ... but still name a strong XI, with seven international players in it. They make five changes to the team that was trounced by Leicester, with Emil Krath, Christian Atsu, both Longstaffs and, despite a broken hand, DeAndre Yedlin starting. Rochdale: Sanchez, Magloire, Williams, O\u2019Connell, Keohane, Ryan, Rathbone, Dooley, Camps, Baah, Henderson. Subs: McLaughlin, Andrew, Lynch, Wilbraham, Gillam, Tavares, Matheson. Newcastle United: Dubravka, Krafth, Fernandez, Hayden, Yedlin, Matthew Longstaff, Sean Longstaff, Atsu, Muto, Almiron, Joelinton. Subs: Ki, Ritchie, Lejeune, Darlow, Allan, Sorensen, Cass. Referee: David Coote (Nottinghamshire). Apologies to Newcastle United supporters for bringing it up yet again, but the definitive FA Cup third-round tie is this one. Ronnie Radford, Ricky George, Supermac, John Motson, kids in parkas, all that. So what are the chances of Rochdale stunning the Toon like Hereford United did back in 1972? On the face of it, they\u2019ve got a job on their hands. Newcastle might be struggling in the Premier League right now, having lost three of their last four matches, but the Dale have lost three of their last four too, and those in League One. Additionally, today\u2019s hosts have only beaten a top-flight side once in 16 FA Cup ties, against Coventry City back in 1971. However, the third round of the FA Cup is the third round of the FA Cup, and so hope is never lost. For a start, Newcastle have only won one of their last 16 away fixtures in the FA Cup. Goliath might not be that confident when he comes to town. And any trepidation they feel will surely be ramped up when they remember Rochdale\u2019s brave performance at Old Trafford four months ago - they held Manchester United to a 1-1 draw in the League Cup before going out on penalties - and the Dale\u2019s 2-2 draw with Spurs in the fifth round of this competition back in 2018. These minnows have form as botherers supreme. Can the Dale pull off a shock? Or will Newcastle prevail as they dream of winning the famous old competition for the first time since 1955? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.31pm GMT. Heads up.",

It\u2019s important for her to know at this difficult time that people are supporting her and the positive coverage in the press is also important for her.\u201d The case has seen the Cypriot legal system subjected to intense scrutiny. Law experts have expressed concern about the way potential evidence, including that provided by the state-appointed pathologist who examined the teenager, was collected. \u201cAn expert witness examined pictures [of the teenager] and what she said [had happened] and observed blood and bruising in her vagina that accorded with what she was saying,\u201d Polak said. \u201cSince this case, we\u2019ve had other people getting in touch to report serious sexual offences, similar problems in Cyprus, and other cases where foreigners have felt that they haven\u2019t had a fair hearing in the courts, from property disputes to all different kinds of matters.\u201d The teenager\u2019s lawyers claim her retraction of the rape claim 10 days after it was alleged to have taken place was made under duress and without legal representation, something that could become an issue for the European Court of Justice. They say she was held for eight hours, subjected to quick-fire questioning and aggressive behaviour, denied access to a lawyer and told that if she did not agree to retract her statement she would next see her mother when she appeared in court in handcuffs.",

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Iranian state television also aired images of a ceremony honouring Suleimani at a mosque in Qom, an Iranian centre of Shia scholarship and pilgrimage. A red flag was unfurled above the minarets, symbolising both blood shed unjustly and a call for vengeance for the dead.</p> \n<p>US officials defended Donald Trump\u2019s decision to order the strike, saying Suleimani had been planning imminent attacks on US personnel, but no evidence was laid out.</p> \n<p>The US has been able to track the general\u2019s movements for years, but previous presidents have held off ordering a strike because of fears of repercussions.</p> \n<p>Critics in the US and beyond have said the assassination risks escalating violence in an already volatile region. The former UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt described the US confrontation with Iran as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/04/jeremy-hunt-us-iran-qassem-suleimani\">\u201cdangerous game of chicken\u201d</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"05ef8c1c-b4d9-4cc0-a5fb-60ba6bdf369e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hApKcYbTB70?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Iran has already vowed to respond to a killing it described as an act of war.

The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, also said Washington did not realise what a great mistake it had made, during a visit to pay condolences to the general\u2019s family.

Two helicopters hovered over the crowd of mourners, who included Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, and leaders of Iran-backed militias. Iran\u2019s envoy to Baghdad, Iraj Masjedi, told Iranian state media that Abdul-Mahdi had insisted on holding a public funeral for Suleimani and al-Muhandis in Baghdad.

Suleimani, 62, oversaw the external operations of Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards and was the architect of an expansion of Iranian influence across the Middle East in recent decades, controlling politicians and proxy militias in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen among other places. A Pentagon statement accused Suleimani\u2019s Quds force of being responsible for the deaths of hundreds of US soldiers and the wounding of thousands more. Once a shadowy operator whose movements were a closely held secret, Suleimani had become a public figure in recent years, often posing for photos on the front lines.

We had lost 1-0 to a fantastic goal and created good chances ourselves. Now it\u2019s about finding consistency in performances and finding a way to win when maybe you\u2019re not at your best. But at the same time you always learn so much more when you lose.\u201d</p> <p>The West Ham defeat stung more because it coloured their strong defensive record. After their opening two defeats in September, United went on a run of five clean sheets, but then conceded in all but one of their next six games in all competitions. Stoney, a former England defender, says her \u201dstrength is in the defensive side of the game\u201d and she is not worried about their form at the back waning a little. \u201cI remind the team constantly, if you can keep a clean sheet you\u2019ve always got a chance of winning the game. In the league none of those have come from open play, so we\u2019re doing a lot of work on our defensive responsibilities at set pieces, making sure that we win first contact, making sure that we clear our lines when we need to.\u201d</p> <p>Her strength in putting together a strong back line meant a penchant for attacking football surprised her when she went into management with United. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that when people come and watch us we play attacking football. We\u2019ve got players in our dressing room that can hurt the opposition. But if your attackers are going to attack they need to know that the back door is shut. People will take more risks if they know that is happening behind them.\u201d</p> <p>A highlight has been the way players have responded to the leap up from the Championship. \u201cKirsty Hanson wins WSL player of the month [and] she\u2019s never played WSL football before,\u201d says Stoney. \u201cAround 40% of our squad has never played WSL football before.\u201d</p> <p>Lauren James, who has eight goals across all competitions, is beginning to mature into the player glimpses of her talent suggested she could be. There was an unusual barrier to her progress, says Stoney. \u201cIt might sound silly but I think turning 18 helped because for the whole year and a half before that she was in a separate changing room to everyone else, which is difficult. The minute she crossed over she became more a part of the team, has more cohesion now with the girls and she\u2019s suddenly just grown up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6507fff9064c3b0fa2323de754335e5f868d7e4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6507fff9064c3b0fa2323de754335e5f868d7e4a/0_0_3500_2397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United\u2019s Lauren James celebrates scoring her first goal against Everton during the FA Women\u2019s Super League match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lauren James has eight goals this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barry Coombs/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 2-0 win at home to Manchester City in the Continental Cup also provided a crucial moment in United\u2019s upward trajectory. \u201cThat was a very strong Man City team. It was an accomplished performance and it gave the players the belief that they can beat the top teams, that they can play at the top table and that they belong there.\u201d</p> <p>But perhaps the most rewarding aspect of the season so far has been the liberation of Leah Galton. \u201cWhen I first met Leah to talk to her about coming to the club she had completely fallen out of love with the game,\u201d Stoney says. \u201cMy main job was to just get a smile back on her face and get her playing and enjoying it. I actually think Leah is one of our proudest achievements, because she\u2019s playing. For me she is the best left-winger in the country because she\u2019s naturally left-footed, can go inside and outside, she\u2019s powerful, she\u2019s quick, and she\u2019s enjoying her football. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s many full-backs in the country that can cope with her.\u201d</p>",

In the league none of those have come from open play, so we\u2019re doing a lot of work on our defensive responsibilities at set pieces, making sure that we win first contact, making sure that we clear our lines when we need to.\u201d Her strength in putting together a strong back line meant a penchant for attacking football surprised her when she went into management with United. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that when people come and watch us we play attacking football. We\u2019ve got players in our dressing room that can hurt the opposition. But if your attackers are going to attack they need to know that the back door is shut. People will take more risks if they know that is happening behind them.\u201d A highlight has been the way players have responded to the leap up from the Championship. \u201cKirsty Hanson wins WSL player of the month [and] she\u2019s never played WSL football before,\u201d says Stoney. \u201cAround 40% of our squad has never played WSL football before.\u201d Lauren James, who has eight goals across all competitions, is beginning to mature into the player glimpses of her talent suggested she could be. There was an unusual barrier to her progress, says Stoney. \u201cIt might sound silly but I think turning 18 helped because for the whole year and a half before that she was in a separate changing room to everyone else, which is difficult. The minute she crossed over she became more a part of the team, has more cohesion now with the girls and she\u2019s suddenly just grown up.\u201d The 2-0 win at home to Manchester City in the Continental Cup also provided a crucial moment in United\u2019s upward trajectory. \u201cThat was a very strong Man City team. It was an accomplished performance and it gave the players the belief that they can beat the top teams, that they can play at the top table and that they belong there.\u201d But perhaps the most rewarding aspect of the season so far has been the liberation of Leah Galton. \u201cWhen I first met Leah to talk to her about coming to the club she had completely fallen out of love with the game,\u201d Stoney says. \u201cMy main job was to just get a smile back on her face and get her playing and enjoying it. I actually think Leah is one of our proudest achievements, because she\u2019s playing. For me she is the best left-winger in the country because she\u2019s naturally left-footed, can go inside and outside, she\u2019s powerful, she\u2019s quick, and she\u2019s enjoying her football. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s many full-backs in the country that can cope with her.\u201d",

Authorities had issued emergency alerts for 10 of those bushfires, down from 13 earlier in the evening. Of most concern are fires burning on the NSW South Coast, including near Nowra and Eden. Out-of-control fires were also causing significant concerns in the Snowy Mountains and the Southern Highlands.</li> \n   <li>Early reports suggest <strong>the loss of homes in the Snowies</strong>. Properties are also currently under threat in the <strong>Southern Highlands and on the South Coast</strong>. Details of the damage remain sketchy and the full extent of the damage will likely not be known until the morning.</li> \n   <li>In Victoria, <strong>about 50 fires continue to burn</strong>, mostly in the state\u2019s north-east and alpine area. Emergency warnings were active for 12 of those fires at 11pm. There was some good news earlier in the day when authorities revised the number of missing persons from 28 to six. </li> \n   <li>A <strong>southerly change</strong> that moved up the <strong>east coast</strong> complicated conditions at firegrounds across the two states significantly this evening. The change brought with it wind gusts of up to 90km/h and shifted the direction of the fires, moving them generally northward and creating new fronts for firefighters to grapple with. Fires were <strong>behaving erratically</strong>, generating their own <strong>weather systems</strong> and <strong>thunder storms</strong>.</li> \n   <li>In South Australia, there <strong>were two confirmed fatalities</strong> on <strong>Kangaroo Island</strong>, with the blaze also wiping out much of the national park. The death toll stands at 23. <br></li> \n   <li><strong>Scott Morrison</strong> yet again drew criticism for <strong>releasing a party political ad that spruiked his government\u2019s response to the bushfires</strong>. The Australia Defence Association said the ad was a clear breach of conventions that prevent the military from being used for political advertisements.</li> \n   <li><strong>Significant power outages</strong> were experienced across <strong>NSW and Victoria</strong>. Authorities urged residents to reduce their energy demand wherever possible to ease the load on the grid. <br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>We will return to our live coverage early tomorrow morning, when the scale of the damage from this evening\u2019s fires will be made clear. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6273f283bdc9f38ec5a5f1eb87b45fc849438eef\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6273f283bdc9f38ec5a5f1eb87b45fc849438eef/0_0_4183_2792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">RFS volunteers and NSW Fire and Rescue officers fight a bushfire encroaching on properties near Termeil on the Princes Highway between Batemans Bay and Ulladulla.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T12:15:45.792Z\">at 12.15pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e107bbe8f087e8308e686c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T11:50:37.461Z\">11.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>An emergency warning has been issued for the area north of the <strong>Shoalhaven</strong> <b>River</b>.

That southerly came just in time to push the fire away from them. But as we keep encountering out in these fires, the relief is pretty tainted for people by the fact that a fire moving away from them means it\u2019s moving towards someone else instead.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T11:25:26.550Z\">at 11.25am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e1070dd8f08c397226449c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T11:06:32.337Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ellinghausen/status/1213416209544183809\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A long night ahead for some residents in the Snowy Mountains with the Adaminaby Complex bushfire still at emergency level <a href=\"https://t.co/YHss01DAVL\">pic.twitter.com/YHss01DAVL</a></p>\u2014 Alex Ellinghausen (@ellinghausen) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ellinghausen/status/1213416209544183809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 4, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e106fb18f085eda5c111fdf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T11:00:31.608Z\">11.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The ACT has declared a <strong>total fire ban again tomorrow</strong> and issued a \u201cstate of alert\u201d for the territory.

At one house, three of them are sitting back watching the cricket. Taking comfort from it, just like Morrison said, it\u2019s wryly noted.</p> \n  <p>They\u2019re not complacent \u2013 they\u2019re ready and it\u2019s evident in the advice we\u2019re given about getting into Longreach and later, getting out. They\u2019re all current and former firefighters, and between them <strong>Brent Edwards</strong> reckon they\u2019ve got about 300 years of firefighting experience.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve all got every bit of equipment known to man,\u201d says retired firefighter, Edwards.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got full structural uniforms if we need them, we\u2019ve got breathing apparatus.

We\u2019ll get out of Dodge. We\u2019ve got one boat down by the river and there\u2019s another bloke coming up the river with another boat if we need to bail.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Edwards is the former station commander of the Shoalhaven fire station, and was back here from the Gold Coast visiting his friends.</p> \n  <p>This situation is \u201cincomparable\u201d to anything he saw in his 35 years as a professional firefighter and a lifetime being a \u201cstudent of the weather\u201d as a surfer, fisherman and diver.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s causing climate change is for another day,\u201d he says.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey just have to admit that it\u2019s changed dramatically and do something about it.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can have an opinion about science?

This town is a mecca for the Australian ski season in the winter, but today it\u2019s right on the edge of what the Rural Fire Service predicts could be a devastating day of fires throughout the region. </p> \n  <p>I just spoke to Mark, a caretaker at one of the retreats in the national park. He evacuated on New Year\u2019s Eve and has been sitting tight ever since. Now, like a lot of people in Jindabyne, he\u2019s worried about how safe he is here. Yesterday RFS officials held a public meeting in town and told residents \u2013 especially from closer to the mountains \u2013 that they couldn\u2019t guarantee they would be able to respond if fire threatened their homes. They\u2019re purely focused on containment at this point. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe were thinking of leaving but then you might get stuck on the road, and where do you go anyway?\u201d he says. </p> \n  <p>The crews are stretched thinly, too. A bunch of the RFS volunteers staying at the same motel as me are being sent to Thredbo today, but there are two major fires burning at Watch and Act level in the national park already this morning and a lot of territory to cover. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-03T21:18:01.710Z\">at 9.18pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e0faa098f087e8308e682d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-03T20:58:10.596Z\">8.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>About 100,000 people have been evacuated from East Gippsland and Victoria\u2019s north-east ahead of today. </p> \n  <p>Late on Thursday, the premier Daniel Andrews declared a state of disaster in Victoria. </p> \n  <p>This map distributed by authorities shows the area already burnt (shaded areas) and the potential impact area (within the bold black line) until midnight tonight.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe potential impact area identifies an area that is likely to be impacted by potential fire fronts moving into communities, spot fires and ember attacks, thick smoke or fire closing major roads and isolating communities,\u201d authorities say. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lukehgomes/status/1213201889451372549\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Victoria's state of emergency map. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vicfires?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#vicfires</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hbKystS7B9\">pic.twitter.com/hbKystS7B9</a></p>\u2014 Luke Henriques-Gomes (@lukehgomes) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukehgomes/status/1213201889451372549?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 3, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e0fa66c8f085eda5c111c30\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-03T20:48:10.219Z\">8.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The NSW RFS has issued a map showing how they expect the fires to spread today.

      "bodyText": "As we near 11.30pm (AEDT), the situation remains fluid and dangerous across parts of NSW and Victoria. Here\u2019s what we know so far: More than 150 fires continue to burn across NSW. Authorities had issued emergency alerts for 10 of those bushfires, down from 13 earlier in the evening. Of most concern are fires burning on the NSW South Coast, including near Nowra and Eden. Out-of-control fires were also causing significant concerns in the Snowy Mountains and the Southern Highlands. Early reports suggest the loss of homes in the Snowies. Properties are also currently under threat in the Southern Highlands and on the South Coast. Details of the damage remain sketchy and the full extent of the damage will likely not be known until the morning. In Victoria, about 50 fires continue to burn, mostly in the state\u2019s north-east and alpine area. Emergency warnings were active for 12 of those fires at 11pm. There was some good news earlier in the day when authorities revised the number of missing persons from 28 to six. A southerly change that moved up the east coast complicated conditions at firegrounds across the two states significantly this evening. The change brought with it wind gusts of up to 90km/h and shifted the direction of the fires, moving them generally northward and creating new fronts for firefighters to grapple with. Fires were behaving erratically, generating their own weather systems and thunder storms. In South Australia, there were two confirmed fatalities on Kangaroo Island, with the blaze also wiping out much of the national park. The death toll stands at 23. Scott Morrison yet again drew criticism for releasing a party political ad that spruiked his government\u2019s response to the bushfires. The Australia Defence Association said the ad was a clear breach of conventions that prevent the military from being used for political advertisements. Significant power outages were experienced across NSW and Victoria. Authorities urged residents to reduce their energy demand wherever possible to ease the load on the grid. We will return to our live coverage early tomorrow morning, when the scale of the damage from this evening\u2019s fires will be made clear. An emergency warning has been issued for the area north of the Shoalhaven River. Authorities advise it is too late to leave if you are in Bundanoon, Wingello, Penrose, Meryla and surrounding areas. Residents should seek shelter. The fire moving up from the Victorian border has prompted a significant response to try to protect Eden. Firefighters are doorknocking to tell people to move to the town\u2019s north, if they haven\u2019t already left. Rogers said: People will be moved to north of Eden. People should stay there, whoever is left there, because the road out of Eden north is quite compromised by heavy timber, so the last thing we want is people caught on that road We have a lot of fire trucks sending in their and we will do our best to protect those homes and people. We\u2019ve just had an update from the NSW RFS. They are reporting property losses in the Snowy Mountains and southern highlands. There are also serious concerns for Eden after fires moved north quickly from the Victoria-NSW border. RFS deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said there still 10 emergency warnings for fires across the state. It will be a very long night for firefighters and the residents in the path of these fires. Nowra, on the NSW south coast, is in for a long night. We\u2019ve just heard reports from the emergency services radio that a water tower reservoir has burst in Cooma, flooding homes, washing away cars and causing property damage. There\u2019s no information yet on whether there are injuries. My last report from Nowra had the divisional commander reporting the southerly would hit about 9pm-9.30pm. It showed up about 7pm. The sky changed to dark, deep, brown and the wind roared in through the very tall and thick forest where we are, whipping up dirt and ash and smoke. Strike teams rushed to Milton down south. A short time later there were intakes of breath as a team was told they were going to Kangaroo Valley. Kangaroo Valley is now under serious threat from the Currowan fire. Earlier today, one firefighter described to me their strategy for the day: we can\u2019t stop the fire, so we\u2019re just trying to direct it as best we can. Strike teams were sent across the state on Saturday, moved around like chess pieces against an opponent that\u2019s ignoring all the rules. A short time ago I heard from the group who stayed to defend their places at Longreach. That southerly came just in time to push the fire away from them. But as we keep encountering out in these fires, the relief is pretty tainted for people by the fact that a fire moving away from them means it\u2019s moving towards someone else instead. The ACT has declared a total fire ban again tomorrow and issued a \u201cstate of alert\u201d for the territory. The state of alert effectively puts the ACT government on a ready footing to respond to bushfire threats. The government is also encouraging residents to develop their bushfire plans, if they have them. Neil James, head of the Australia Defence Association, has explained why he believes Scott Morrison\u2019s ad spruiking his response to the bushfires breaches non-partisan conventions involving the military. He told Guardian Australia: It\u2019s simple. You don\u2019t use the defence force for party political advantage. They put out a media release giving people all the information so you have to ask yourself what the purpose of the ad is, and the purpose is clearly party political advantage. And that is just plain wrong. James said it was critical that the ADF was allowed to remain completely independent and non-partisan. The defence force needs to be professionally and institutionally non partisan and for that to work the politicians have to respect it. We\u2019ve complained about this before. It usually happens during election campaigns. More grim news for the region around Eden on the far south coast. The bushfire burning on the Victoria-NSW border has moved north and is now threatening towns. The RFS has issued an emergency warning for Womboyn, Kiah, Narrabarba, Towamba, Burragate, Eden and surrounds. The RFS has warned it is now too late to leave these areas. Residents are at risk. They should seek shelter as the fire approaches. Images are continuing to filter in from around Nowra, where the Currowan fire continues to burn out of control. The fire is more than 264,000 hectares in size and the opportunity to leave has now ceased for all areas between Nowra and Kiola east of the Princes Highway. Residents in those areas are advised to seek shelter as the fire approaches. Residents in Freeburgh, Harrietville, Smoko, Wandiligong and surrounding areas in Victoria\u2019s north-east are being urged to evacuate to safer locations. There are multiple bushfires burning in the Abbeyard area that are not yet under control. Just on that fire now burning through Kangaroo Valley, our photographer Jessica Hromas was on scene near Nowra when the southerly wind hit earlier. She\u2019s filed these shots from the the local rugby club, which is the staging area for emergency services. The Cuurowan fire on the NSW south coast is now burning in the Kangaroo Valley. The RFS has issued an emergency warning for anyone in the valley, saying they should now seek shelter. Japanese meteorological satellites have captured an extraordinary time-lapse of smoke drifting eastward from the bushfires covering NSW and Victoria. The animation gives a sense of the scale and movement of the smoke as it shifts into the Tasman. We mentioned a little earlier *that* party political ad put out by Scott Morrison\u2019s office spruiking their response to the bushfires. The reaction to the video has been, er, less than positive. The Australia Defence Association, a non-partisan defence watchdog and think tank, says the video\u2019s use of military personnel is a clear breach of non-partisanship conventions that restrict the use of the ADF in party political advertisements. In case that wasn\u2019t enough, British TV presenter Piers Morgan has also taken a swing. And what a swing. He describes the video as \u201cone of the most tone-deaf things I\u2019ve ever seen a country\u2019s leader put out during a crisis\u201d. It goes from bad to worse for the prime minister. We are getting reports that people are being moved from evacuation centres in Eden, on NSW\u2019s far south coast, towards Merimbula. Fires burning just north of the Victorian border, including the Poole Road fire, are spreading quickly and emergency warnings have been issued. The southerly change is generally moving those fires on the NSW-Victorian border to the north. For those in the Canberra, ABC reporter Markus Mannheim has just created a handy map illustrating the city\u2019s bushfire-prone areas. It covers a large chunk of the bush capital. The ACT has so far avoided the bushfire crisis plaguing much of neighbouring NSW, though the smoke haze has continued to create significant air quality issues. Those in Canberra will keenly remember - as I do - the horrific events of 2003, which were the result of out-of-control fires that burned to the south-west and west of the city for more than a week. Fires are worsening in some areas of Victoria. We\u2019ve just seen two emergency warnings issued by Victorian authorities. The first is for Buchan and Buchan South. Authorities say it is now too late to leave. Residents should shelter indoors and activate their bushfire survival plans. Another emergency warning was issued for Brookville and Omeo, in the state\u2019s east. It is too late to leave these areas. Residents should shelter indoors immediately. Power outages are continuing across NSW. Ausgrid reports that power is out for some homes in Fletcher and Wallsend, suburbs of Newcastle. A little earlier, it said the outages were affecting 14,000 customers, primarily in Sydney\u2019s north and south-west. But it has since restored power to some areas, including Hornsby, Normanhurst, Bexley North, Campsie, Canterbury and surrounding suburbs. Our reporter Helen Davidson was in Nowra a little earlier when that southerly swept through. The conditions precipitating the change were ferocious. It brought strong wind gusts and a sudden change in the sky. Jessie Davies, an ABC reporter, was also there and posted this footage showing the terrifying conditions. Bushfire evacuees have begun to arrive at relief centres after fleeing the devastating bushfires in East Gippsland. They are arriving at a relief centre in Somerville, after being evacuated aboard HMAS Choules. The Navy vessel was was deployed to help the thousands of people stranded in the remote Victorian coastal town of Mallacoota. Some have a clear message for the federal government. Authorities in Victoria have just issued an emergency warning for Benambra, The Brothers, Tom Groggin, Uplands. Those fires are near Omeo, 430 kilometres east of Melbourne. Leaving now is the safest option. Some extraordinary footage in NSW, where bushfires continue to generate their own weather systems. This vision shows the forming of pyrocumulous clouds above the Currowan fire burning in the Southern Highlands region about an hour ago. Fitzsimmons has some semblance of good news, at least. We should see conditions ease overnight and tomorrow morning, once this southerly moves through. But we will see conditions worsen later in the week, when temperatures will climb back into the 40s. For example in western Sydney, the indications from the bureau are that the western Sydney weather station today is likely to break high temperature records. I know - there\u2019s a lot of fire fatigue if you like. What we can\u2019t afford to have is people becoming complacent and thinking behind all this intensity today that things are OK because they\u2019re certainly not. We are going to have thousands of kilometres of fire edge that needs to be dealt with over the coming week or so. It hardly needs saying, but there is of course another total fire ban in NSW tomorrow, despite the slight easing in conditions. Fitzsimmons has a grim message for what we should expect to find when we wake tomorrow morning. It will only be then that the full extent of the damage is known. I should say, too, across those firezones we are getting reports of significant damage and destruction that are starting to come in with reports of property impact and properties burning in a number of these different fireground locations, given the speed and ferocity at which these fires are burning, and I think we do, unfortunately, need to be ready, probably tomorrow morning, once we start getting an indication of what that level of damage and impact might have been throughout this afternoon and, indeed, over the coming hours into this evening. The NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons has just given another update on the ABC. He says the southerly change is having a complicated impact on active fires across the state. This southerly change is somewhat complex because you\u2019ve got this coastal buster that is moving up and it has got so far north as, say, Shoalhaven, but we are only seeing the south-westerly aspect of that, or if you like the change effect across the ranges, across the high country and the southern slopes south-west of the ACT, for example. It is only just starting to move through and it is going to take many, many hours to move through those firegrounds. So we need people to remain very vigilant. We\u2019ve still got a very, very dry landscape. We\u2019ve got very aggressive fire behaviour, and it is very easily influenced by the direction and speed of these winds, and it will be many hours, once the front goes through, before we can start seeing the weather conditions settle down. Scott Morrison has heard some pretty frank views from those on the ground in recent days about his response to the bushfire crisis. Perhaps none as direct as this, though. An RFS member in Nelligen, just north of Batemans Bay on the hard hit NSW South Coast, pulled up to a news crew on the side of the road, leaned out the window, and told the prime minister to \u201cgo and get fucked\u201d. Vision is below. Global superstar Pink has offered $500,000 to Australian fire services battling bushfires on the frontline. Pink said she was \u201cdevastated\u201d at the horrific bushfires tearing across Australia. It\u2019s a pretty extraordinary gesture. She\u2019s also encouraged her millions of fans to donate too. Some good news out of Victoria. The bushfire around Dargo and Tabberabbera, in the state\u2019s east, has been downgraded from emergency warning to watch and act, after conditions eased. The RFS is reporting that southerly change is causing wind gusts of up to 75km/h near Nowra. It has warned the change will push many fires generally in a more northerly direction. It will create dangerous conditions. Reporter Helen Davidson is just south of Nowra. That southerly change sweeping up the NSW coast has just hit. The wind gusts are fierce. The vision is scary. Mike Bowers and Michael McGowan are still out near the fire front at the Snowies, near Adaminaby. They report the fire has broken out of the National Park along the Yaouk Road, to the town\u2019s north. Just a little more on the power outages in NSW. The extreme heat conditions are causing power outages across NSW, including parts of Sydney. In Hornsby and Normanhurst, power outages are expected to last until about 8pm. Crews are also working to restore power in Bexley North and Kingsgrove, Campsie, Canterbury and Earlwood. Authorities are strongly advising residents to avoid unnecessary power use. Do you need your air conditioning on full bore? Is your pool pump operating unnecessarily? It\u2019s time to start thinking about how you can reduce demand on the grid. Hi everyone, it\u2019s Christopher Knaus here taking over our live coverage for the evening. It will be a nervous night, particularly for those on the NSW South Coast and in the Snowy Mountains region, where, in some places, the vast, out-of-control bushfires have blackened the sky hours before nightfall. The NSW RFS incident map paints a terrifying picture as we head into the night. There are roughly 150 fires burning across NSW. Thirteen emergency warnings have been issued for fires, largely on the NSW south coast, but also for the Dunns Road and East Ournie Creek fires in the Snowy Valleys. The vast Green Wattle Creek fire is threatening to creep towards towns in the southern highlands, including Mittagong, as well as Wombeyan Caves, Bullio, Joadja and surrounding areas. A southerly change continues to move slowly up the NSW coast, bringing with it strong wind gusts - forecast to reach up to 90km/h - and considerable uncertainty as fire fronts shift and change. The southerly most recently reached the Ulladulla and Jervis Bay regions. Early reports suggest the winds have not been as strong as first feared. In Victoria, about 53 fires continue to burn this evening, particularly in Gippsland region. In Corryong, reports suggest that homes have been lost. That fire continues to cause considerable concern, as do fires in Mount Buffalo, Mount Hotham, and East Gippsland. We still have reporters and photographers across the worst hit areas to bring you up to speed on the latest developments. Stay with us. It\u2019s been a big day, with a challenging night to come. Let\u2019s take stock. There were two confirmed fatalities on Kangaroo Island, with the blaze also wiping out much of the national park. Substantial fires continue to burn in NSW and Victoria, and authorities warn conditions tonight remain dangerous. Fire thunderstorms have formed both on the south coast and the Snowy. There could also be power disruptions because of damage to substations in the Snowy region. Authorities have requested people take pressure off the system when they can by reducing demand, otherwise there could be load shedding \u2013 a challenging request given record temperatures in Canberra and sweltering conditions in Sydney. In Victoria, the number of fatalities remains at two, and six people are missing, revised down from 28. Scott Morrison \u2013 who has been criticised for lacking the requisite leadership in the crisis \u2013 called out the ADF reserve, and changed the posture of the Commonwealth\u2019s emergency response to be more forward leaning. The government deployed defence assets and funded more water bombers to assist the containment exercise. He also found time to put together an advertisement. Thanks to colleagues in the field today: the two Mikes McGowan and Bowers, Helen Davidson and Jessica Hromas, Luke Henriques-Gomes in Victoria and Ben Doherty in Sydney, and to the news production team in Sydney. Please follow advice and stay safe. Please. Stay connected and follow instructions from authorities that could save your life. I\u2019ll go back to hosing the dehydrated magpies. Over to Chris Knaus for the night shift. Back to Nowra. Mark Coombes, NSW Fire and Rescue\u2019s divisional commander for the north recently addressed a new shift of firefighters here. \u201cRight here we are the meat in the sandwich, so thanks for coming down.\u201d Around Nowra and further south, dozens of new fires sparked this afternoon. On the Princes Highway huge, dark columns of smoke were on the horizon in every direction. The road is closed south of Jervis Bay road, so we wound our way through the bushland between Jervis Bay and the highway, towards Bewong. The Currowan fire jumped the Shoalhaven river earlier this afternoon near Illaroo farm, with flames more than 20m into the air. At St George\u2019s basin residents who stayed behind are in gardens and on roofs, hosing down houses and trees as text messages come through warning everyone from Nowra to Kiola about 90km south to take shelter. The enormous flank of the Currowan fire, and related blazes, is moving east. At its northern end, near Nowra, the fire generated its own thunderstorm. The southerly change, due around nine or nine thirty with 80 km/h gusts to enrage the fires, isn\u2019t even here yet. \u201cFire intensity is going to be right up there, very comparable to what\u2019s been happening today on this side of it\u201d, said Coombes. \u201cThere\u2019s been a bit of information from the north side of the river of flame heights around 40 metres.\u201d The fire was recently behind Tomerong, and they are worried that if the fire gets on the eastern side of the highway there will be serious problems with protecting property. That\u2019s the guts of Victoria. I\u2019m going to hand over shortly to my colleague Chris Knaus to take you through tonight, but before I do that, Helen Davidson has an update, and I will post a summary. Hang five. The ADF says at this stage, it has not been able to conduct fixed wing sorties into Mallacoota due to smoke impeding the air operations. Hopefully that will happen tomorrow, and people will be able to be evacuated by air. \u201cIn the meantime, as soon as our rotary wing helicopter assets are relieved of tasks such as evacuating people from Omeo, they will return to the more logistics and support tasks, for example taking stores into Mallacoota.\u201d There is a change expected at midnight, but the Victorian authorities say the risk remains significant. Looking ahead to tomorrow, the high risk areas remain Corryong, Buffalo, Bright, Hotham and Dinner Plain. Reporters check. Just to confirm, the number of fatalities remains at two? \u201cCorrect\u201d. And six missing. \u201cYes, that\u2019s correct, still at two, and now the good news is about the six \u2013 the number being greatly reduced. However, as the chief commissioner has previously pointed out it is fairly fluid as to how those numbers might move.\u201d The commissioner says the service has undertaken more than 1,000 assessments in relation to properties. He says at this stage, there\u2019s been about 110 property losses, and about more than 220 outbuildings. \u201cBut this is just the start in relation to the initial impact work that we need to do. There\u2019s still many, many communities that we\u2019ve not been able to really get into and do a proper assessment.\u201d Working through specifics. The fire commissioner says there has been significant fire activity around Corryong today, and some property losses on the outskirts of town. He says it is still 41C in Corryong. At Mount Buffalo, \u201cwe\u2019ve had a going fire there, we\u2019ve had a significant column on that fire and we still do\u201d. He says there has been some spotting to the east into some valleys which are south of Bright, \u201cso we are doing what we can but keeping a very close eye on that particular fire and the potential impact into those valleys\u201d. There\u2019s a significant fire at Mount Hotham. \u201cThat fire, there has been a fire fairly close to Dinner Plain as a result of that fire, and at the moment we\u2019ve had CFA working in protection of Dinner Plain. They\u2019ve moved back to Mount Hotham itself.\u201d He says over the next few hours we could see some losses into Dinner Plain, and that same fire has also been running down towards Omeo. He says further into East Gippsland, there were two significant columns on a fire at Cann River. \u201cAgain, we understand those there have been again well-protected. However, we believe there will be potential property losses in the area of Cann River.\u201d The Victorian fire commissioner says the situation as of right now is this: Today we\u2019ve had 73 new fires start. So at the moment we have 53 going fires across the state, with the vast majority of those in the eastern part of the state. At the moment, we have 13 emergency warnings, four watch and acts, and three evacuate now. The premier says it\u2019s been a challenging day, but the challenges have been eased considerably by people following instructions from authorities. The Victorian premier, Dan Andrews, has some good news tonight. He\u2019s providing an update now. Dan Andrews: Off the top, can I indicate some good news \u2013 I will come to some challenges in a moment, but can I indicate, in some good news, a number of people across East Gippsland that were previously missing and couldn\u2019t be accounted for have been found. I can\u2019t tell you how pleased we all are to be able to report that we\u2019ve gone from 28 to 21 \u2013 and it is now down to six people who cannot be accounted for. Let\u2019s take stock of conditions in Victoria by recapping the updates and alerts. There hasn\u2019t been a central update from the premier and emergency management authorities for some hours. Apparently that will happen soon. In the interim. An Emergency Warning is being issued for Bendoc, Bendoc North, Bendoc Upper, Bonang, Buldah, Cabanandra, Club Terrace, Combienbar, Deddick Valley, Delegate River, Dellicknora, Errinundra, Goongerah, Haydens Bog, Nurran, Roaring Camp, Tubbut, Yalmy. It is now too late to leave. This fire is threatening homes and lives. An Emergency Warning is being issued for Castleburn, Cobbannah, Cowa, Crooked River, Dargo, Grant, Shepherdson, Tabberabbera, Talbotville, Waterford, Wongungarra, Treasures. There are large bushfires north and east of Dargo, Tabberabbera and surrounds that are out of control. Spotfires are starting about 10kms north of Dargo, and 10kms east of Tabberarabbera ahead of the main fires. These fires could impact Dargo, Tabberabbera and surrounding areas any time between 6pm and 8pm. Severe thunderstorms are likely to continue producing damaging, locally destructive winds in Dargo and surrounding communities this afternoon and evening. An Emergency Warning is being issued for Suggan Buggan, Wulgulmerang, Wulgulmerang East. There is a large bushfire traveling south east towards Suggan Buggan. There is also a large bushfire traveling north towards Suggan Buggan. There is currently extreme and unpredictable fire behaviour. You may be exposed to wild, erratic fire behaviour and heavy ember attack. You are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. I\u2019m focusing on the live updates right now, rather than Scott Morrison\u2019s deeply unfortunate promotional video which I posted earlier, but I will just point out that if you look on the Liberal party\u2019s Facebook page, and if you click through to the explanatory material about today\u2019s announcements from the prime minister, in the top right hand corner of the page you have an opportunity to shop, or donate, while you peruse the information. Seriously. Shocker. Let\u2019s keep moving. This shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone, given the events of the day. A statewide total fire ban has been declared for all of NSW for tomorrow, Sunday 5 January 2020, beginning at midnight. Conditions are expected to be severe and very high across the state. No fires may be lit in the open and all fire permits are suspended during a total fire ban. Gas and electric barbecues may be used provided certain conditions are met. Not that we need an illustration to tell us why power assets have been compromised, but this short clip from Mike Bowers puts you in the fire ground. On that subject, here\u2019s the NSW energy minister Matt Kean. Please follow this advice if you can to take pressure off the grid. Obviously a disaster of this magnitude affects vital infrastructure. TransGrid says the power grid has been impacted. Paul Italiano, the chief executive of TransGrid (these guys operate the high voltage transmission network in the state) has just told the ABC they are experiencing fire damage to assets around the Kosciuszko National Park. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to separate the two states and it is no longer operating as a single national electricity market and that has compromised the availability of energy to New South Wales.\u201d Q: Which areas and communities are impacted? Paul Italiano: At the moment the only community directly impacted by our assets is the township of Tumut. The area of most concern to us is the area between Upper Tumut and Lower Tumut, that is where the Victorian and New South Wales systems are synchronised and we can\u2019t operate either of those transmission systems at the moment from those substations. For the past hour here near Adaminaby it\u2019s felt like midnight. We just stood and watched as two separate fires came over the ridge at almost exactly the same time. It\u2019s blazing at the top of the hill now, long columns of fire spreading out in front of us. A team of about five tankers followed not long after the fire appeared over the mountain, retreating down the slope towards a property that they\u2019re trying to protect at the bottom of this steep hill. There were other properties further into the national park that the fire crews we spoke to earlier were worried about. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to them. There\u2019s debris and ash falling around us everywhere, and the wind is still howling. People evacuated from the fire-ravaged Victorian town of Mallacoota are being transported to a disaster relief centre at the Melbourne convention centre. One of them, Nick Ritar, was earlier today on board HMAS Choules, a massive naval vessel that is evacuating 1,100 people by sea. Ritar is with his partner, Kirsten Bradley, and their son, Ashar, 10. \u201cI\u2019m on this ship with 1,000 other climate refugees\u201d, Ritar told the Guardian earlier today. Ritar praised the defence force and emergency services personnel, but it sounds like it\u2019s been a long journey. \u201cIt sort of became evident last night there were a lot of people standing around at 3am without anywhere to sleep\u201d, he said, adding that his family has been lucky enough to get a bunk. As you\u2019d also expect, the mood reflected the experiences of those on board. \u201cThere are people here who have lost their homes, they\u2019ve evacuated because they literally no longer had a home\u201d, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s other people who are backpackers from around the world. They\u2019re doing what young people do, meeting each other, playing cards and laughing and joking.\u201d HMAS Choules docked at Hastings about 4pm today. While I\u2019m on images. The NSW premier. We are still to hit the worst of it. Trying to keep clicking out of my ears. Really trying, because there\u2019s a disaster to focus on. The disaster, through the lens of Mike Bowers. In Canberra, the ACT chief minister Andrew Barr has just given a brief update for residents of the capital. The short version of the briefing is we are ok now, but stay alert, given Canberra has recorded its hottest ever day, and the wind is whipping, and the fires are close, and many of us have seen these conditions before. In 2003. Andrew Barr: The wind conditions remain very strong, it\u2019s obviously a day of extreme fire danger. Canberra people are experiencing this uncomfortable day. There is a lot of anxiety in the community, particularly as they see what is unfolding in surrounding New South Wales. Whilst there continue to be no active bushfires in the ACT, it\u2019s important that Canberrans remain prepared for emergency. Speaking of gritted teeth, the commonwealth commitments now have a backing track. And clicking. Let\u2019s press on. ADF personnel are also at this briefing and the NSW commissioner says the state has spoken to the commonwealth to ensure today\u2019s commitments by Scott Morrison don\u2019t compromise the current containment efforts. I\u2019ll let the fire commissioner explain. The one thing we have spoken to the commonwealth about following the announcement this morning is to seek clarity and confirmation that the recall of reservists won\u2019t compromise all those men and women, whether they are volunteering or employed by agencies already committed to the ongoing firefighting effort. \u201cThe last thing we want is people removed from the firefighting effort. The brigadier and I have spoken about that, and there are comprehensive databases where they\u2019ll exempt people who already heavily committed which is reassuring for us. What we don\u2019t want in this announcement and pledge is to compromise the ongoing firefighting effort. The premier is also asked about a story in the Daily Telegraph today suggesting that NSW had knocked back commonwealth support during this crisis. If you didn\u2019t detect the gritted teeth from the fire commissioner in this last answer (and I must say I did), you can certainly detect gritted teeth from the premier. \u201cNot true. Not true\u201d, the premier says. The fire chief echoes that. Not. Happy. He\u2019s asked about the fire generated thunderstorms. The NSW commissioner says that freak weather can flip a 10-tonne truck. \u201cA lot of the fire grounds we have already seen firefighters being withdrawn for safety to shore up and focus on protecting as much as they can that might be coming in the path of that fire. Under these conditions, suppression is unachievable. The focus becomes saving life and property as much as we can.\u201d The NSW commissioner is asked about reports of people not respecting today\u2019s total fire bans. He\u2019s blunt. It\u2019s against the law and if people are doing it, they\u2019ll be prosecuted. There are conditions that allow for barbecues in domestic dwellings and designated parks and reserves. We don\u2019t want people adding to our problem, adding to the risk that is already significant for the people of New South Wales. If anyone sees people doing the wrong thing, again, please report it. Action will be taken decisively straightaway. The NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, says there are 148 fires burning across the state and 12 are now at the emergency warning alert level. There are another eight fires at the watch and act alert level. He says the greatest concentration of the emergency warning fires are down in the south-eastern quadrant of the state. He says if emergency warnings are in place it\u2019s too late to leave. \u201cYour option for safety is to shelter as the fire approaches\u201d. Fitzsimmons says the southerly won\u2019t move into NSW until about 5pm, and won\u2019t hit Sydney until around midnight. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very long afternoon and evening and, as that southerly approaches, it\u2019s going to be a volatile southerly with wind strengths up to 80km/h or more. A long, difficult few hours, a dangerous few hours given the amount of emergency alerts out there\u201d. The NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian is addressing reporters now. She says today is as bad as the projections suggested. \u201cIn relation to the projections we had this morning, unfortunately they are coming to fruition. We are in for a long night and I make no bones about that. We are in for a long night and we have still to hit the worst of it\u201d. As well as the one in Nowra, the NSW RFS says a fire-generated thunderstorm has also formed over the Doubtful Gap Trail in the Snowy Monaro area. In the NSW southern highlands, an emergency warning has been issued in the Green Wattle Creek (Wollondilly LGA). The advice is fire activity is increasing in the area of Joadja. If you are in the area, it is too late to leave. Seek shelter as the fire approaches. Still on that fire. Defence assets are active in the Currowan Fire, which looks horrendous. The Illawarra Mercury says 30,627 customers in the Batemans Bay and Moruya region have lost power. Chilling images from Mike Bowers. Brett Mason, the SBS political editor, is in the Snowy region with our two Michaels, Bowers and McGowan. Looking seriously grim in that part of the world. That beautiful, glorious part of the world. Back to Mike Bowers in the NSW Snowy Mountains. Looks like a marathon underway there too. The Bairnsdale incident controllers are asked how long they think the fires can continue to burn for? A long time, is the answer. Based on the best estimate, we would say at least another eight weeks ... we are only at the beginning of summer. In a normal year, we would start to see the fire season kickoff in a big way around early January and we\u2019re already up towards a million hectares of burnt country. We would expect \u2013 we are in for the long haul. This is a marathon event and we expect to be busy managing these fires for at least the next eight weeks. The incident controller in Bairnsdale in Victoria says today has been extremely difficult and there are over 1,000 firefighters in the field. \u201cLow relative humidities, freaky wind conditions coming out of all different directions and temperatures are in the 40C range have tested every resource today.\u201d He says there have been impacts in the Omeo Valley, but \u201cluckily for the Bairnsdale area and the southern parts of Gippsland, we didn\u2019t see the quite freakish conditions that we saw to the north, and we\u2019ve been able to hold a lot of the southern edge of the Gippsland fires\u201d. What we don\u2019t know is what the impacts have been. We suspect there\u2019s been a number of homes lost and we\u2019re at the moment trying to get as many people out of the Omeo and Swifts Creek areas as we can, using Australian Defence Force helicopters. The firefight is going to continue, this aggressive firefight, to save as much property as we can but also to keep our people safe. That will continue well into the night until we start to see an easing of fire weather conditions hopefully towards midnight tonight. The prime minister has bobbed up on ABC news radio. He\u2019s asked why it has taken so long for the government to announce the response that was unveiled today. Scott Morrison says the government has been respecting the states and their requests, but he said his time in fire grounds this week has persuaded him that the Commonwealth needed to integrate with the state efforts. While Morrison squabbles with the host on ABC radio, Victorian authorities are providing an update. I\u2019ll bring you that next. In Canberra, the smoke isn\u2019t too bad right at the moment (famous last words given the situation around the ACT) but my trusty weather app tells me it\u2019s 42C. Reporter Jasper Lindell at the Canberra Times says temperatures in the city hit 43.6C \u2013 the highest reading ever recorded in the city, beating a 1968 Canberra Airport record and a 1939 record. Back to the Snowy region in NSW. Scott Lonard is the RFS group captain in charge of the Adaminaby Complex fire which was upgraded to emergency level a few minutes ago. Lonard told me a little bit earlier that he arrived in the Snowy Mountains at about 11pm last night from Penrith with 10 tankers. Five have been sent to another emergency fire near Cooma and the rest are here. He\u2019s pretty frank about the prospects of stopping the fire. There are two properties out here on Yaouk Road that he\u2019s worried about \u2013 but he won\u2019t send his crews any further in where the forest starts. \u201cWe\u2019ll do our best but five trucks for this much space isn\u2019t going to be enough\u201d, he told me. The fire has been building here just north of the town of Adaminaby for a few hours now and the whole area is thick with smoke. Just before it was upgraded to an emergency level warning, Lonard said he feared it would get worse as the afternoon progresses. \u201cIf you see me running, try to keep up\u201d, he told us. More vision from eastern Victoria. With conditions now highly variable as the heat intensifies and the winds change, let\u2019s do a very quick stocktake of events so far today. Tragically, two more deaths have been confirmed this morning on Kangaroo Island. The Kangaroo Island fire has destroyed much of the Flinders Chase National Park. Emergency alerts remain current for a number of fire-affected regions in NSW and Victoria, with comprehensive updates from authorities expected a bit later this afternoon. Scott Morrison has called out the ADF reserve to help manage the disaster and the HMAS Adelaide, the navy\u2019s largest amphibious ship, has been readied to join the current ships in supporting the evacuation of citizens from fire affected areas along the coastline. The prime minister has also committed up to $20m to lease four extra planes to meet any anticipated future requests from the premiers. That will include two long range fixed wings DC-10s with 30,000 litres capacity and two medium range large air tankers with an 11,000 litre capacity. The NSW RFS says a fire-generated thunderstorm has formed over the Currowan fire on the northern edge of the fire near Nowra. \u201cThis is a very dangerous situation. Monitor the conditions around you and take appropriate action,\u201d the alert says. Across the border in Mallacoota it looks like midnight in the middle of the afternoon. I can\u2019t actually watch this short clip without feeling deeply anxious. This is how it looked in Canberra in 2003. Let\u2019s check Victoria for the latest from VicEmergency. An emergency warning is being issued for Biggara, Tintaldra, Towong, Towong Upper, Walwa and surrounding communities. As at 13.00 hours increased fire conditions have been observed. You need to continue to monitor conditions. The Murray Valley Highway is closed in both directions due to increased potential for impact from the fire. Fire weather today Saturday 4 January is predicted to be extreme, creating fire storm conditions which may not be survivable. A wind change is expected late this afternoon or early this evening, which will cause the fire to change direction towards the northeast. Conditions can become very dangerous and unpredictable. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately. It is too late to leave. You are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. An emergency warning is being issued for Buchan, Buchan South. There is a bushfire at Buchan Valley that is not yet under control. Fire activity is increasing in the area. The Bruthen-Buchan Road south of Buchan is now closed due to fire impact. It is now too late to leave. Enact your bushfire survival plan now. The safest option is to take shelter indoors. An emergency warning is being issued for Gelantipy, Murrindal, W Tree. There is a bushfire at Buchan Valley that is out of control. This fire is threatening homes and lives. W Tree, Murrindal and Gelantipy could be impacted at any time. You are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately. It is too late to leave. This Watch &amp; Act message is being issued for Angusvale, Cobbannah, Crooked River, Dargo, Glenaladale, Iguana Creek, Tabberabbera, Wongungarra and surrounds. The bushfires to the north and east of Dargo and to the east of Glenaladale are continuing to grow and move. Firefighters will not be able to control these fires in today\u2019s predicted weather conditions. This Watch and Act replaces the Watch and Act issued at 8.56am. Don\u2019t wait, leaving now is the safest option \u2013 conditions may change and get worse very quickly. Emergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay. Back to NSW, I mentioned the warning for Dunns Road. There are now several warnings current. In addition to the one I mentioned a minute ago: EMERGENCY WARNING - Currowan Fire (Shoalhaven LGA) The fire has crossed the Shoalhaven River. If you are in the areas of Coolendel and North Nowra or Wandandian, Tomerong, Palmer and Basin View, it is too late to leave. EMERGENCY WARNING \u2013 Clyde Mountain (Eurobodalla LGA) If you are in North Batemans Bay, Surfside, Long Beach, South Durras, Maloneys Beach and Long Beach it is too late to leave. Seek shelter as the fire approaches. EMERGENCY WARNING \u2013 Clyde Mountain (Eurobodalla LGA) Areas north of the Moruya River including Mogendoura, Polwombra and across to the coast near Moruya Airport. It is too late to leave. Seek shelter as fire approaches. EMERGENCY WARNING - Green Wattle Creek (Wollondilly LGA) Fire activity is increasing in the area of Wombeyan Caves, Bullio and surrounding areas. If you are in this area, it is too late to leave. Seek shelter as the fire approaches. Also: this for traffic in that vicinity. MOGO TO MORUYA: The Princes Highway is closed in both directions between Tomakin Road and North Head Drive due to bush fire. Broulee Road is also closed. Stay away. Ominous over the border at Mallacoota too. The NSW RFS has just issued an emergency warning for Dunns Road (Snowy Valleys LGA). Fire activity has increased in the area of Ellerslie, Adelong and surrounds. It is now too late to leave. Seek shelter as the fire approaches. I spent Christmas in the bush between Tilba and Cobargo hoping to escape the heavy smoke in Canberra. My family left 48 hours before disaster struck. Things are looking ominous in Narooma this afternoon, just up the road. It\u2019s currently 42C in Canberra. My weather app tells me it\u2019s 46C in Sydney and 47C in Penrith in the west of the city. An update from Helen, who sent me the last blog post while I was watching the prime minister. Now she tells me: a senior RFS source says 20 new fires have broken out between Nowra and Batemans Bay, and that fire crews are being pulled out of the Snowy Mountains, east of Jindabyne. \u201cIt\u2019s turned to shit,\u201d he said. Longreach sits along the shore of the Shoalhaven river, the scattering of houses along the single road surrounded by towering trees. It\u2019s a beautiful corner of the world to make your own, but today it\u2019s literally in the firing line. At one property we find a group of people who have stayed to defend. At one house, three of them are sitting back watching the cricket. Taking comfort from it, just like Morrison said, it\u2019s wryly noted. They\u2019re not complacent \u2013 they\u2019re ready and it\u2019s evident in the advice we\u2019re given about getting into Longreach and later, getting out. They\u2019re all current and former firefighters, and between them Brent Edwards reckon they\u2019ve got about 300 years of firefighting experience. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve all got every bit of equipment known to man,\u201d says retired firefighter, Edwards. \u201cWe\u2019ve got full structural uniforms if we need them, we\u2019ve got breathing apparatus. We\u2019re pretty sorted \u2013 Flash has spent three weeks preparing this place. He\u2019s got pumps set up everywhere, plenty of water. George down the bottom has four pumps sitting in his swimming pool. But he\u2019s got a 25 acre paddock, he\u2019s OK. Might get a bit of an ember attack but we\u2019re a bit more exposed here. \u201cMy concern is, as always, we\u2019re, for want of a better word, experts. And we\u2019ve got everything. What about the poor punters with just a garden hose?\u201d He says there\u2019s a few people further down with less experience who have stayed. \u201cWe\u2019re all sort of old blokes now, there\u2019s a couple of 70-year-olds among us. We\u2019ll get out of Dodge. We\u2019ve got one boat down by the river and there\u2019s another bloke coming up the river with another boat if we need to bail.\u201d Edwards is the former station commander of the Shoalhaven fire station, and was back here from the Gold Coast visiting his friends. This situation is \u201cincomparable\u201d to anything he saw in his 35 years as a professional firefighter and a lifetime being a \u201cstudent of the weather\u201d as a surfer, fisherman and diver. \u201cWhat\u2019s causing climate change is for another day,\u201d he says. \u201cThey just have to admit that it\u2019s changed dramatically and do something about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can have an opinion about science? How do you have an opinion about fact?\u201d The weather is entirely different than it used to be, just look at the lack of southerlies bringing rain this season, he says. Not to mention the wind behaviour in these fires. Across the firegrounds I\u2019ve visited I\u2019ve repeatedly heard about its unpredictability. The conversation moves to the structure of the firefighting services in NSW, the logic of backburning, and funding \u2013 another big and complicated conversation for another day. Flash heads outside to \u201csmell the air\u201d, then turns on the pumps and comes back suggesting it\u2019s probably a good time for us to go. Let\u2019s go to Victoria. The state department of environment, land, water and planning has issued an update for Gippsland, saying winds are strengthening and warning that, given the wide spread and sheer number of fires, they may not be able to get to towns to fight all blazes when they hit communities. \u201cConditions are heating up and wind is getting stronger across the region,\u201d the latest update says. \u201cAreas that have already been impacted may be impacted again- due to patches of unburnt material across the landscape. There is the potential for a number of communities to be impacted today\u201d. \u201cOur focus is on protecting people and critical infrastructure in communities \u2013 so we will have crews and machinery in place where we can \u2013 but cannot guarantee a presence.\u201d That fire is within 8 kilometres of Omeo. More details can be found here. I might give you some thoughts about all that if time permits, but right now, we need to look what\u2019s happening beyond the prime minister\u2019s courtyard. Hang five. I\u2019ll be back with a situation report on the fires. There were questions about events in Iran, which I won\u2019t delve into given the focus of the coverage today. Morrison ended thusly: For all Australians today, stay safe, listen to instructions, stay patient, be kind and support each other as I know Australians will. In crises and disasters like this, I always see the best of Australians and the best of Australians will be on display, particularly those very much in the face of that ferocious fire front. I want to thank all of those for everything they\u2019re doing today, every child they comfort, every service they render in ensuring that we get through today and that we get into the rebuilding phase. I want to assure Australians about this: We will rebuild. At a Commonwealth level, we will be playing a significant role, as we have in response to previous disasters, to ensure we meet and beat this challenge as Australians always have. Thank you very much. Scott Morrison is pressed on the government\u2019s lack of action on climate change. He\u2019s asked whether he plans to increase the level of ambition. Morrison treads cautiously. He says the current policy is responsible and balanced. He says the negative feedback on the fire grounds is not about a lack of action on climate change, it\u2019s about heavy fuel loads in bushland. But he sends a broad signal he\u2019ll be raising all of these issues with the premiers. Climate change. Fuel loads. Land clearing. Planning regulations. It\u2019s not entirely clear which issues specifically. Scott Morrison: These are difficult issues to balance and resolve and this, of course, will be one of the things that we will consider when premiers come together after they\u2019ve been dealing with the fires and that\u2019s where they want to be at the moment. I have spoken to premiers about this. They don\u2019t want to be coming to meetings, they want to be dealing with the fires, which is where they are and they\u2019ll continue to do that. The prime minister says people under duress have mixed emotions and they display them. \u201cThese arms have given a lot of hugs in the last three months, in fact almost the last year and a half in which I have been prime minister.\u201d Scott Morrison: There is a lot of criticism and commentary that comes on these things by a capture of a small moment and what you simply seek to do in these circumstances ... you try and respect people\u2019s space but it is a very emotional situation and you have to try to manage it as best you can. What I must do is what I\u2019m doing today. The best response I can provide to people feeling angry and isolated, for people who are fearful and afraid is to do what I\u2019m doing today. Scott Morrison is then pressed on events in Cobargo. The prime minister is asked why he said (a few times now) that he had spoken to the young woman who tried to avoid shaking his hand until he made a commitment to provide more resources to the fire effort, when footage of the incident showed him walking away from her after her comments. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all seen that video by now. Morrison says he spoke to her and to other people in the town. I understand her anger. As I said before .. my response to that - I was the first senior leader to go into Cobargo and I understand the first person who is going to walk into that town was going to feel the anger and the fury and the frustration and the loss and the fear that was effort in that community. Q: Will you follow up with her? Scott Morrison: We will be responding to the need in Cobargo. Her need was to ensure there was greater RFS support and I have relayed that on to the RFS. That was the key issue she raised with me. Scott Morrison is asked whether the premiers are on board about the NSC proposals. He says he spoke to them this morning and they were positive. He\u2019s then asked whether the boost to funding for water bombers is ongoing. Morrison says it is. Morrison is asked about the ongoing health impacts of the smoke. He says: The advice we have received is that the response that is available to support those health needs at present is working well and there is no requirement for additional support whether it be through hospitals or things of that nature. The prime minister confirms his planned overseas trips, to India and Japan, are off. The defence minister is then asked to clarify the extent of the call out of the ADF reserves. Linda Reynolds says the government has estimated up to about 3,000, \u201cbut again, it might be less, it depends on what\u2019s actually required as we go forward. At the moment this is open-ended\u201d. The prime minister is asked where the new water bombers are coming from. He says he\u2019s advised two will be available within seven days and the other will be available within 14 days. Scott Morrison is asked how worried are you about the risks today. He ignores the specific inquiry and moves to convey empathy. He says he understands how anxious people are, and he says the government will be with them all the way. The prime minister says the feedback he\u2019s picked up on the ground has led to today\u2019s decisions. What I saw particularly last week is what happens after the fire has gone through and how isolated and alone people feel. I experienced that first hand. That has been a key factor in what has led to today\u2019s decision. We have moved to questions now. Q: With the bombers, the RFS chief Shane Fitzsimmons in New South Wales has said today that the federal government rejected the business case a couple of years ago for more of those water bombers. Was that a mistake and how quickly will they be able to actually be tackling the fires in Australia if you are leasing them? The prime minister brushes the question off. He says the government responded with two separate decisions of $11m which brought it up to the same level of capacity as was sought by that business case. \u201cSo that business case was addressed through a different method\u201d. The prime minister is flanked by the defence minister Linda Reynolds. She makes a point of praising the prime minister. Linda Reynolds: I also like to thank the prime minister for his incredible leadership in this difficult time for our country and also to minister Littleproud. This has been a whole-of-government effort from the very start. The co-operation at all levels of government, both federally and with the states, has been outstanding. Scott Morrison ends his opening salvo by thanking the premiers for their support. I know where their focus is. My focus is is in the same place. We are communicating regularly and constantly and the fire chiefs and the other emergency services leaders are doing an outstanding job. But he says the primary objective today is to keep people safe. The prime minister says the government will also stand up a national recovery agency \u201calong the lines of what we established for drought and for the response to the North Queensland floods and we\u2019ll have more to say about that in the next few days about those arrangements\u201d. The prime minister says just around half an hour ago, the governor-general signed off on the call-out of the Australian Defence Force Reserve to \u201csearch and bring every possible capability to bear by deploying army brigades to fire affected communities across Australia\u201d. Morrison says a two-star emergency ADF national support co-ordinator will have national authority over the ADF joint task forces in each of the affected states working in co-operation to support state emergency authorities. He says the HMAS Adelaide, the navy\u2019s largest amphibious ship, has been readied to join the current ships in supporting the evacuation of citizens from fire affected areas along the coastline. The Adelaide has been loaded up with a bunch of kit. Morrison says the NSC today committed up to $20m to lease four extra planes to meet any anticipated future requests from the premiers. That will include two long range fixed wings DC-10s with 30,000 litres capacity and two medium range large air tankers with an 11,000 litre capacity. He says the Commonwealth will fully fund the leasing costs with operational costs to be shared with state and territories as usual as they seek to use those assets. Scott Morrison: They asked for one, we gave them four. Having now acknowledged where things stand, Morrison is making a number of announcements. He says traditionally the Commonwealth\u2019s role in disaster management has been respond to requests, but now there needs to be a more forward leaning approach. Scott Morrison: We now must move our posture as a Commonwealth from a posture of respond to request to move forward and to integrate with the local response. This has been the very clear message that I have received on the many fire grounds in the many affected communities I\u2019ve visited now over some months but I particularly must say over the last couple of weeks. The scale of the fires is stretching resources on the ground and there are clearly communities that need additional help and in response to that, we must move forward first as a Commonwealth, particularly with the work of our defence forces, and then integrate with the local operations that are in place in those local communities. The prime minister has emerged in his courtyard in Canberra. The opening salvo from Scott Morrison is empathy for the victims and thanks to the authorities and the premiers. Morrison is now acknowledging the scale of the problem Australia faces. Scott Morrison: In recent times, particularly over the course of the balance of this week, we have seen this disaster escalate to an entirely new level. This length of season is, of course, in many senses, unprecedented, but the ferocity and the absence of dousing rains that would normally bring a season like this under greater control is nowhere in sight and so that means a much longer season is planned for. Just while we wait for Scott Morrison, Murph mentioned earlier that more than 1,000 people have been successfully evacuated from Mallacoota in eastern Victoria by the Royal Australian Navy, with the first rescued residents arriving to safety. HMAS Choules and MV Sycamore arrived at Mallacoota, cut off by out-of-control bushfires, on January 2, with residents able to register for evacuation if they wished to leave. The ships loaded with passengers and left the town Friday morning. Sycamore docked at the Port of Hastings, in Western Port, on Saturday morning, after nearly 20 hours at sea. Choules, carrying most of the 1,000 people evacuated, is expected to arrive Saturday afternoon. \u201cThe embarkation process started at around 8am, with people being moved from the community centre to the pier by buses provided by community members, and then moved across to the two ships using five landing craft embarked in Choules\u201d, Choules\u2019s commanding officer, Commander Scott Houlihan said. \u201cSome 1,000 people were welcomed on board, and by early evening we had completed the embarkation and were underway heading towards Western Port.\u201d In addition to the human passengers, the navy vessels have also evacuated 135 dogs, several cats, a rabbit, and even a pet bird. \u201cThe general spirit among our guests has been one of appreciation mixed with relief to get away from the devastation, and the heavy blanket of smoke that has engulfed the region\u201d, Choules\u2019s executive officer Lieutenant Commander Arron Convery said. \u201cOf course, there was some level of worry, but there were many hugs of appreciation throughout the day.\u201d The ships will return to Mallacoota once passengers have disembarked. While flying in the smoke-stricken region remains difficult, federal member for Gippsland Darren Chester said the military had also evacuated people out of Mallacoota on a Spartan aircraft on Thursday night. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people getting out of Mallacoota airlifted out who are vulnerable, super sick, or ill or injured with the Black Hawk helicopters\u201d, Chester said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mass relocation of a nature which is completely unprecedented in Gippsland\u2019s history.\u201d Defence was also able to move 10,000 litres of fuel ashore, replenishing two service stations in the town. About 3,000 people remain in Mallacoota. The town remains cut off by bushfires, which could burn for weeks. Mike Bowers is also on the ground in the Snowys. He says the wind gusts are now up to 60km, which doesn\u2019t bode well. Back to the Snowys. I\u2019ve just spoken to the Adaminaby RFS captain, Glen Squire, who has just come back from a run around the fire grounds. There\u2019s multiple blazes burning only a few kilometres from where I am just north of town, and he\u2019s concerned that as the wind from the north-west continues to pick up \u2013 and it\u2019s really blowing now \u2013 they\u2019ll converge into one. \u201cThe issue we have is that a lot of the timber around here is mountain ash, which is really unpredictable\u201d, he told me. A bit further up the road from where I am, the paddocks give way to that heavy timber. Squire tells me there\u2019s a bunch of property owners in there who have refused to leave, and he\u2019s very worried about them. \u201cIt\u2019s not spotting right now but of the wind picks up a bit more it might be a different story\u201d, he said. \u201cShe\u2019s starting to get a bit of colour about her now. It\u2019s only about two kilometres (from where we\u2019re standing).\u201d I asked him if he\u2019s concerned about the town itself: \u201cShit yeah\u201d, he says. Local fire crews have been working on containment lines for weeks but there\u2019s so many burning around them and the wind is so unpredictable that it\u2019s hard to be certain about what might happen later in the day. It\u2019s hard to believe that the NSW cops would have to issue a statement warning people not to steal other people\u2019s things during a bushfire emergency but circumstances are such that the statement has been issued. In the statement that shouldn\u2019t have to have been issued but was, sadly, the state emergency operations controller, deputy commissioner, Gary Worboys, said both uniformed and plain-clothes police are already patrolling fire affected areas \u2013 and they have aerial surveillance support. Gary Worboys: Police and emergency services are at the ready to prevent loss of life, livestock and property, and I am disgusted that anyone would target these vulnerable communities at this time. People in these areas have already lost members of their communities, seen property destroyed and suffered emotional turmoil from the recent fire activity, they do not need the added stress of looters stealing what little they might have left. Local police numbers are being bolstered by officers from specialist commands to ensure regular patrols are conducted throughout the bushfire-affected areas. With thousands of lives and homes at risk today, I can\u2019t comprehend the type of person who\u2019d think it\u2019s okay to try and profit or benefit at other people\u2019s expense. Any reports of criminal acts will be thoroughly investigated. This sort of behaviour will not be tolerated by police or the wider community, and police will take immediate action to put these people before the courts. In the southern highlands of NSW. I mentioned earlier today the national security committee of cabinet has been meeting in Canberra this morning. Scott Morrison is due to speak to reporters in about 15 minutes. Inspired, and we could use a bit of inspiration right now. Some more news from Victoria, where the situation is moving fast. There has been an update to an emergency warning for people near the Goongerah fire, which is on the Victoria-NSW border. People living in the Upper Snowy have been told it is too late to leave. The fire there, which is south of Bendoc and moving north towards the NSW border, is now threatening lives and homes. \u201cLeaving now would be deadly,\u201d the alert says. The Princes Highway is now closed from Lake Tyers road, near Lakes Entrance to NSW border, a 200km stretch of road. Hello if you\u2019ve just joined today\u2019s live coverage of the bushfire emergency. I trust your fire plans are in place if you are in affected regions. This is not a drill. Here\u2019s a quick summary of the main events this morning. Two more deaths have been confirmed this morning on Kangaroo Island. The Kangaroo Island fire has destroyed much of the Flinders Chase National Park. That fire remains at watch and act level. In Victoria, fires in the north-east are continuing to burn, and 28 people remain unaccounted for. The first evacuees from Mallacoota have arrived safely at Hastings. In NSW, residents of large towns in the southern highlands have been advised to consider their need to be there. Residents of Alymerton, Braemar, Balaclava, Willow Vale, Mittagong, Welby along Wombeyan Caves Road and Joadja Road have been advised to relocate, according to local media. The deaths confirmed this morning in South Australia bring the fire-related death toll to 21 since October. There have been eight fatalities this week. The ABC says almost 450 homes have been lost on the south coast this week, taking the total number of homes destroyed in the state this bushfire season to more than 1,300. It\u2019s noon, and we\u2019ve hit 38C in Canberra. Time for a summary if you are just tuning in. I\u2019ll post that next. Back to Victoria. God, your heart breaks. To the southern highlands of NSW, the Illawarra Mercury is reporting that residents of large towns are being advised to assess their need to stay in the area. Residents of Alymerton, Braemar, Balaclava, Willow Vale, Mittagong, Welby along Wombeyan Caves Road and Joadja Road have been advised to relocate. To the NSW coast now. We\u2019re at the Shoalhaven rugby club, which is acting as a staging ground for the RFS, Fire and Rescue, police, and paramedics. Strike teams here could be sent anywhere - it\u2019s a waiting game. Some have headed towards the Shoalhaven river, where there are concerns the fire could jump to the northern side, getting into bushland and threatening communities like Bundanoon, Penrose, Wingello, and the Kangaroo Valley. Darin Sullivan, station officer for Shellharbour Fire and Rescue, said they\u2019re expecting flare ups on several fronts. Not everyone in those communities have left, and some places are holding community meetings today. Sullivan noted that while it might look like the fire is relatively far away, it\u2019s a matter of 15-25km and we have seen fires in recent days regularly spotting 15km ahead of the forefront. \u201cI was at Batemans Bay on New Year\u2019s Eve and saw the devastation down there first hand. I responded on a team from Shellharbour that night, we had to get through the Nowra fire just to get there to help out. I pulled into Conjola on the way back up - I\u2019ve got a property at Conjola and my family was in Conjola that day. I ended up evacuating my wife out on the firetruck - she was in Conjola when the firestorm run over that day. So everyone\u2019s got stories. \u201cTricky days.\u201d Checking in on the high country in NSW, where it remains a waiting game. I just spoke to a fellow named Hugh outside his son\u2019s 1400 acre property north of Adaminaby. The land runs up into the national park, and isn\u2019t separated by a fence. Right now strong gusting winds are blowing a fire in the direction of the property, and smoke has settled above us. Hugh\u2019s son, Guy, has been building containment lines for weeks though and he\u2019s hopeful that it won\u2019t come through to the house. \u201cAll we\u2019ve heard from the RFS is they\u2019re very under-manned and it\u2019s up to ourselves to defend ourselves,\u201d Hugh said to me. \u201cThe bush is so dry though. I guess one good thing about the drought is that usually the grass up to the house would be a lot higher. We\u2019re just watching to see what happens.\u201d Time to check in elsewhere now. Luke Henriques-Gomes has eyes on Victoria and tells me two emergency warnings have been issued in the past 15 minutes. There are now seven warnings in place across the state. The latest warning is for people at Gelantipy and W Tree and is available here, in East Gippsland and near Buchan. \u201cW Tree and Gelantipy could be impacted anytime within the next [half hour],\u201d the alert says. \u201cLeaving now is the safest option, before conditions become too dangerous. Emergency Services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay.\u201d Still in South Australia, the CFS chief officer Mark Jones puts the risks starkly and eloquently. Look across the country, look at the news, Australia is enduring the worst drought it has had in living memory. The fuels are ready to burn and all it needs is a simple spark to create the bushfire that can spread so quickly in unkind weather conditions. In periods of high fire danger we encourage everyone who is in an area that may be bushfire affected to stay alert, have a plan, as I said I Christmas, if your neighbour doesn\u2019t have a plan, give them one as a gift. This is a serious matter, we have learned today of a terrible tragedy on Kangaroo Island in which two people lost their lives. But think of the efforts that have been made by firefighters on the ground to preserve lives. Dozens more have been saved by their efforts each day through these fires, and I think it is important to recognise the bravery and heroism ... on the ground in protecting people and lives and property. So I would emphasise to everyone this is not over, the fire season is in its infancy and the risk remains if severe weather comes through the rest of the season, the risk remains that severe fires may occur. I would ask everyone to be vigilant and do their best to help the firefighters minimise risks to themselves. The SA premier has just told reporters there have been two deaths in the Kangaroo Island fires. Steven Marshall: The forensic team from SAPOL is on its way, as we have more information we will make it known, at the moment the focus is on informing next of kin, our hearts go out to the family of those people that have been affected. Again, it really does reiterate the very important message that people listen to, the alerts, which are coming out now from the CFS, this is a very dangerous situation on Kangaroo Island, and please stay alert to what is going on on the island, and to instructions from SAPOL. The South Australian premier Steven Marshall is also providing an update about the situation on Kangaroo Island. The premier says the fires on the island first began on December 20. They have now been burning for more than two weeks, but yesterday \u201cthere was a very serious escalation in the danger regarding this fire with the weather conditions significantly deteriorating\u201d. Steven Marshall: It is fair to say the rapid damage assessment hasn\u2019t been completed, but what we already know is more than 100,000 hectares have been the subject to very significant fires on Kangaroo Island. This has taken out much of the Flinders Chase National Park. The premier says currently, there are around 500 people involved in fighting the fires on Kangaroo Island today. The local fire chief predicts the fires will burn for some days. He says during yesterday\u2019s dramatic fire conditions, they had to evacuate the airfield where the water bombers were stationed, and three CFS vehicles were burned over, \u201cbut it is a testament to the skill and discipline and training of the volunteer firefighters that none are reported as having been injured\u201d. The Labor leader Anthony Albanese, and the party\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, are addressing the media in South Australia. There is a significant fire on Kangaroo Island. This video gives you a sense of how bad things are in that region. Penny Wong: We stand with you and we will work to rebuild and we pray that all of you remain safe. Anthony Albanese: We need to make sure every request is met with a yes. For residents of the NSW south coast, the latest advice on the roads. In the last little while, the NSW fire service has issued the following advice. Watch and Act - Pilot Lookout (Snowy Valleys LGA) Several fires are spreading in Kosciuscko NP. If you are in Thredbo Village, Little Thredbo, Bullock Flat, Crackenback &amp; surrounds leave now to Jindabyne via The Alpine Way. Watch and Act - Werri Berri and Badja Forest Road, Countegany (Bega Valley LGA) An inversion layer is lifting over the Bega Valley &amp; fire activity is increasing. Strong NW winds will push the fire towards the coast. If you\u2019ve been following the bushfire coverage, or if you follow events on social media, you\u2019ll know that Scott Morrison has been criticised for his handling of the disaster, and for the government\u2019s record on climate change. If you follow politics, and if you are reasonably across Morrison and his private interests, you\u2019ll already know the prime minister is a big fan of Tina Arena. If you follow the prime minister on Instagram, you may also have noticed that Arena has issued her own call to action. In a comment under Morrison\u2019s most recent post updating people about the fires, Arena says: \u201cNo more coal mines opening Scott ... It\u2019s over! Drastic changes are required so MAKE the difference ... and now.\u201d Our reporter, Mick McGowan, is in the high country today, where communities are on high alert. If you are just tuning in, Saturday, so far. The NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons has predicted it will be \u201ca long and difficult day for everybody\u201d. The NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian says there is still a short window to evacuate from fire affected regions. The NSW emergency services minister, David Elliot \u2013 the bloke who has been on holiday as the state burned \u2013 is back on the job. He says he won\u2019t quit. \u201cI came back to step up, not step down.\u201d The first group of evacuees from Mallacoota has made it to Hastings. In Canberra, the national security committee of cabinet is meeting, and we expect to hear from the prime minister Scott Morrison later in the day. Morning all, thank you very much to Luke. It\u2019s Katharine Murphy with you now, from smoky Canberra. Only 10.30 and it\u2019s already 31C here. If you are near any of the fire affected regions, do your fire plans people. Do it now. The Guardian\u2019s Ben Smee looked at the prime minister\u2019s much-maligned response to the bushfires crisis. Ben spoke to a public relations expert about what the former Hawke government press secretary Barrie Cassidy described as \u201cthe destruction of a political leader\u201d. I might take the chance now to share some of the bushfire coverage that the Guardian has published this morning. Environment reporter Graham Readfearn filed this story about the impact of the fires on native species. Readfearn spoke to experts who say fires on Kangaroo Island in South Australia could push the endangered dunnart \u2013 a tiny mouse-like marsupial \u2013 close to extinction. It is one of a number of rare species that may wiped out as a result of the unprecedented bushfire crisis. Victorian emergency services minister Lisa Neville says the second person in Victoria who was confirmed to have died yesterday has now been identified. His name is Fred Becker. \u201cI want to pass on my condolences and the condolences of the Government to family, to the community of Genoa, who will be suffering as a result of this on top of the trauma they have faced in relation to fair fires,\u201d she says. Graham Ashton says there are now 21 people missing in the state as a result of fires. The figure quoted yesterday was 28, so this appears to be good news. However, Ashton notes that the figure may shift again. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get into communities to again not withstanding the fire activity, get into communities and look for those people and satisfy ourselves that the people are OK and safe and well,\u201d he says. Victoria police commissioner Graham Ashton says thousands have evacuated from the leave zone. About 60-70% of people spoken to by police said they were leaving. Fewer people leaving in East Gippsland, though that\u2019s because many have already left. \u201cTraffic flows have been heavy,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, motorists have been behaving very responsibly on the roads out through the heavy traffic flows, which has been of great assistance. \u201cSo it\u2019s really heartening to see people that have been heeding warnings and behaving so patiently on our roads as they\u2019ve been making their way out.\u201d Crisp returns to evacuations. He puts it in these terms: If you might be thinking, I can get out on a particular road, well, there\u2019s every chance that a fire could hit that particular road and you can\u2019t get out. We saw that a week ago with the Mallacoota fire. We had our Gippsland fires and then we had the Mallacoota fire start. So within a matter of hours, the Princes Highway was closed. We see that people are isolated down in that part of the state. So, please, if you\u2019re in any doubt whatsoever, if you know your local conditions, if you are keeping up to date with what is happening on the Vic Emergency app, listening to the emergency broadcasters, and you can get out, you should get out now, if you still have the time \u2013 you should be doing that.\u201d Crisp thanks the thousands of people who have evacuated from six local government areas across the state since Thursday. He warns that in the Alpine area there is the potential again for the \u201cpyro-cumulus columns to develop, and develop their own weather, so they can throw out their own lightning\u201d. \u201cWe still have those dynamic and dangerous conditions, the low humidity, the strong winds, and what underpins that, the state is tinder dry,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is really, really dry at the moment.\u201d Crisp says there was some significant fire behaviour last night, particularly in the Alpine area. \u201cWe have seen wind gusts up to 67km/h already today, up at Mount Hotham,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s predicted when the change comes through we will see gusts up to80 km/h. The change has come through for the west of the state, moved through Melbourne, it\u2019s moving now into East Sale at 10am. \u201cWe won\u2019t see that change until about 1pm, up at Wangaratta, and 4pm at Albury and not until 7-8pm will it be at Falls Creek out of the north-east.\u201d Victorian emergency services commissioner Andrew Crisp notes there is a watch and act in place in the Glenelg area, near Portland. That\u2019s in the state\u2019s west. A number of people were evacuated from a camping area there. He is making the point that although much of the focus has been in the state\u2019s east and north-east, there is the potential for fire anywhere in the state. A press briefing is about to begin with emergency services officials at Victoria\u2019s state control centre. We\u2019ll bring that to you shortly. We\u2019ve made it to the town of Adaminaby, about an hour or so north of Jindabyne and right in the centre of the Snowy Mountains leave zone. It seems like most people here have heeded the Rural Fire Service\u2019s warning to leave. All the shops here are closed and the streets are dead quiet. The wind that RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons warned about earlier this morning is starting to pick up now, and burnt leaves are falling from the sky around us. About 450 emergency services staff are being housed at a massive tent city in East Gippsland that has been open since 18 December. The base camp at Swan Reach, in between Bairnsdale and Lakes entrance, on the Tambo River. The CFA said it has sourced almost all services, produce, and equipment from local businesses, which have also suffered an economic cost from the ongoing bushfire crisis. \u201cMore than 5000 litres of fuel is being used each day at the camp, refuelling fire trucks and vehicles, and ensuring generators keep powering the site,\u201d the CFA said in a press release. \u201cCrews are also consuming 1200 bread rolls, 140 kilograms of fruit, and 60 kilograms of sandwich meat per day. Hygiene has also been taken into consideration, with 30 toilets being emptied twice a day, and more than 50 industrial loads of washing being done to ensure staff have clean bedding.\u201d Jingellic is in NSW, just on the border with Victoria, and north of Corryong. It\u2019s threatened by the massive, 127,000-ha, Green Valley fire. NSW emergency services minister David Elliott is asked if he wants to elaborate on his Facebook post saying his absence inexcusable. He doesn\u2019t. Elliott says he has received a briefing and will be supporting the premier and the commissioner throughout the day. He intends to visit fire lines over the coming days, however he will be unavailable due to a funeral on Monday. A reporter asks if he intends to stay in the role. \u201cI came back to step up, not step down,\u201d he replies. And that\u2019s the end of the media briefing. Fitzsimmons is asked about a proposal put to the federal government for a funding boost to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre. He confirms that the federal government is yet to back the proposal \u2013 and says that fire authorities need more funding certainty. \u201cWe have had a business case in with the Commonwealth to increase that funding which will be matched by the stats and territories,\u201d he says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a positive response to that business case.\u201d That business case has been with the federal government for 18 months. But he adds: What we have seen is the equivalent of annual injections of funding over the last two seasons, last season and you heard the announcement with the Commonwealth injecting another $11m. The business case was $11 or $12m to have that capacity sitting here [each season]. And Fitzsimmons says that the RFS went to the NSW government and was able to buy its own dedicated air tanker after arrangements were established with the northern hemisphere. NSW is the only state that has been able to do that, he says, and it is able to share its assets with other states. \u201cWe have national coordination arrangements. They work very well, but what we need is certainty around the funding going forward so we can secure better economies of scale and certainty around what we\u2019ve got here and how we\u2019re sharing it going into the future,\u201d he says. You can read more about the funding proposal in this story by the Age. It is the same proposal that past fire chiefs like Greg Mullins have criticised the government for failing to adopt. I mentioned to you earlier that the NSW emergency services minister David Elliott is back in the state. He\u2019s been under fire for going on holiday during the crisis. A reporter asks Berejiklian where Elliott is today. She says he is here at the briefing. The reporter asks Elliott if he wants to say where he will be for the day. Berejiklian answers for him. \u201cHe will be here.\u201d Are you glad to have him back? \u201cOf course,\u201d the premier says. That map shows the potential for ember attack and, on that point, Fitzsimmons says: \u201cWe have experienced in NSW, this season, 12 to 15km fires starting ahead of the main fire front taking hold easily and spreading very, very quickly in advance of the main fire front and they tend to catch up with each other and consume what\u2019s in their path.\u201d The map we showed you earlier predicted the fire spread. That is the worst case scenario, Fitzsimmons says. However, he notes that that usually, authorities have a \u201clikely\u201d and a \u201cworst case\u201d scenario. \u201cGenerally speaking over the last five years or so, the most likely generally correlates with what actually happens on the ground. \u201cWhat we saw on New Year\u2019s Eve, a lot of the fires were working to the worst case scenario. So a lot of the shaded areas that you\u2019re seeing today around the predictive tools and the modelling that\u2019s derived that product is defaulting to what we\u2019re calling the worst case scenario based on our experience from New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d Fitzsimmons is asked about fires just outside the Greater Sydney area. He says of the Green Wattle Creek fire, which is in a national park to the west of the city. \u201cWe have got a prediction on that, that it spreads under the westerlies or particularly under the swing in the wind from around west, north-west through the southerly,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is potential for the fire to break out, cross the dam and move into the western suburbs of Sydney. That fire is burning. It has the potential to come out into more populated areas this afternoon. \u201cThat\u2019s one of our focus fires, of course, but I would say a broader is message be alert, be focused on any new fires today. If you see a new fire today, please report it on 000.\u201d However, we know there are people have decided to stay. Fitzsimmons says many people have left the vulnerable community of Batlow, west of Canberra. But about 40 people have stayed, he says, according to the last figure he\u2019s seen. \u201cThey are in the town centre and if Batlow gets impacted, they will be in the town centre with the local fire brigades,\u201d he says. Those on the coast will head to the beach or to evacuation centres, he says. Fitzsimmons is asked for the key message on evacuating. He says: Our message has been make sure you leave yesterday. Leaving it until today is cutting it fine. The sooner you make that decision, the better and I would say do it now. Don\u2019t leave it any longer because the window will shrink and will shrink very quickly. As I indicated, the hot, dry temperatures are expected to be setting in from 8am through to 11am of significance. Fitzsimmons: \u201cIt will be a long and difficult day for everybody.\u201d NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons says the concern is that new fires will start under the hot, dry and windy conditions. More than 100 are already burning in NSW. \u201cWe will see westerly winds, northerly winds turning westerly winds throughout the morning and throughout most of the day, before we see a fairly volatile southerly change moving up the coast sometime late this afternoon and getting to places like Sydney, not until late tonight,\u201d he says. Temperatures will climb into the high 30s and early 40s about 11am. A southerly change will set in later in the afternoon. \u201cBut whatever the case, we\u2019re going to have a long day dominated by hot temperatures, dry atmosphere and winds coming out of the ranges. We are talking 40, 50, gusting to 70km/h from the north-west and the southerly change that\u2019s coming through.\u201d Berejiklian says the major road networks remain open, meaning there is a short window this morning for people who have not yet evacuated to get out of the area. \u201cBut we can\u2019t guarantee that beyond the next few hours,\u201d she says. The premier thanks what she says could be \u201ctens of thousands\u201d who have already chosen to evacuate. The NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has started speaking in Sydney. She is pleased to say \u201cwe\u2019ve never been as prepared as we are today for the onslaught we\u2019re likely to face due to the deteriorating conditions\u201d. The premier says there will be more than 3,000 firefighters, including 31 strike teams which will be located indifferent parts of NSW. We make no bones about it, today is all about saving lives. Good news from Victoria. The first group of evacuees from Mallacoota, in the state\u2019s far east, have made it to shore in Hastings in the Western Port bay. Hundreds more will arrive on the massive ship HMAS Choules today. Good morning from Jindabyne, at the edge of Kosciuszko National Park in the state\u2019s Snowy mountains. This town is a mecca for the Australian ski season in the winter, but today it\u2019s right on the edge of what the Rural Fire Service predicts could be a devastating day of fires throughout the region. I just spoke to Mark, a caretaker at one of the retreats in the national park. He evacuated on New Year\u2019s Eve and has been sitting tight ever since. Now, like a lot of people in Jindabyne, he\u2019s worried about how safe he is here. Yesterday RFS officials held a public meeting in town and told residents \u2013 especially from closer to the mountains \u2013 that they couldn\u2019t guarantee they would be able to respond if fire threatened their homes. They\u2019re purely focused on containment at this point. \u201cWe were thinking of leaving but then you might get stuck on the road, and where do you go anyway?\u201d he says. The crews are stretched thinly, too. A bunch of the RFS volunteers staying at the same motel as me are being sent to Thredbo today, but there are two major fires burning at Watch and Act level in the national park already this morning and a lot of territory to cover. About 100,000 people have been evacuated from East Gippsland and Victoria\u2019s north-east ahead of today. Late on Thursday, the premier Daniel Andrews declared a state of disaster in Victoria. This map distributed by authorities shows the area already burnt (shaded areas) and the potential impact area (within the bold black line) until midnight tonight. \u201cThe potential impact area identifies an area that is likely to be impacted by potential fire fronts moving into communities, spot fires and ember attacks, thick smoke or fire closing major roads and isolating communities,\u201d authorities say. The NSW RFS has issued a map showing how they expect the fires to spread today. It gives you a sense of why they were so keen for people to evacuate today. It shows the serious risk of ember attack along the coast, from Jervis Bay, through Ulladulla and Bateman\u2019s Bay, and down to Narooma, where fires are currently burning. You\u2019ll note that the large patch of red on the left covers the Kosciuszko national park, which has also been evacuated. An unfortunate sidebar to the horrific scenes we\u2019ve seen in bushfire-ravaged communities across the south-east has been the political response to the crisis. David Elliott, the NSW emergency services minister, was heavily criticised after he jetted off to Europe for a holiday last month as much of the state was on fire. He returned last night and has addressed the controversy in a Facebook post. \u201cMy absence over the last week was inexcusable,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cI should have put my RFS family first and foremost given the current conditions (even my own family acknowledge that) and now it\u2019s time to get back to work.\u201d I suspect this won\u2019t be the last you\u2019ll read about this. Here\u2019s an update from the NSW RFS overnight. That\u2019s 60 fires burning out of control. And conditions are expected to deteriorate significantly today. We\u2019ll be able to give you more information when the NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian and emergency services chiefs front the media in the next few minutes. Good morning. I\u2019m Luke Henriques-Gomes. Thanks for joining us on what is expected to be one of the worst days of the bushfire season so far. Thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate communities throughout the east coast, from Batemans Bay in NSW to the Victorian region of East Gippsland. As always we\u2019ll be with you throughout the day to bring the latest news and developments.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>1 We want to </strong><strong>be thin but we lie about it</strong><br></h2> <p>Since I\u2019ve been a journalist, I\u2019ve done a ton of diets for one article or another. I never had to justify it, or explain what I think about my own body, and how that relates to other women\u2019s body images, and how the tension between living as a feminist and living as a woman in the world is resolved \u2013 because it was always for a piece.</p> <p>But I went on diets before I was a journalist, and I never admitted it, either. It was always something else: I\u2019m eating carbs eight hours apart from proteins because it\u2019s good for my skin. I\u2019m raw-fooding for spiritual reasons. These fermented foods are for my sluggish mood. To admit that you want to lose weight for its own sake (and this was even worse in the 80s, by the way) was unfeminist, unserious: you can\u2019t imagine <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg\" title=\"\">Rosa Luxemb</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg\" title=\"\">urg</a> worrying about her batwings.</p> <p>Then as now, it was impossible to overstate how much sheer approbation you got from being thin, from everyone: friends, colleagues, children, peers, people who hate you, people you\u2019ve just met, in-laws, bus drivers \u2013 the thinner you are, the more people mention it. When you are not thin, there is simply an absence of praise, a discreet silence. Vogue once ran an editorial (ironic, coming from them, but whatevs) saying \u201cwomen don\u2019t stay thin to please men; they stay thin to dominate other, fatter women\u201d. When I read it \u2013 at an impressionable age \u2013 it seemed so catty and stark that I thought it had to be true, except it\u2019s not. Women who stay thin do it because they are also human, and as such social; existing among other people is much more enjoyable when they audibly approve of you the entire time. You cannot politics your way out of that.</p> <p>So a double imperative lurks beneath every fad, every fake intolerance, every detox: be ashamed of your size, but also be ashamed of your shame, then cover the whole thing in silence. I think if we rejected the silence, that would be the first step towards saying, \u201cActually, all this shame is incredibly unfair.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>2 Respect the power of your own body</strong></h2> <p>At school, everyone had an eating disorder. Once, someone had a genuine meltdown because she\u2019d bitten the skin around her fingers and accidentally swallowed it, and didn\u2019t know how many calories that was. We didn\u2019t have Google then.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why I was so pathetic? Why couldn\u2019t I simply govern myself? This is a common theme: why can\u2019t those people try harder?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was almost a requirement to be counting calories the entire time, and I could never figure out why I sucked at it so badly. One day I would eat nothing but a tin of tomatoes and some sugar-free jelly. The next, I\u2019d stop at every sweet shop between my school and my house (six miles of heavily built-up streets). Why I was so pathetic? Why couldn\u2019t I simply govern myself? This is a common theme in the obesity narrative: why can\u2019t those people just try harder?</p> <p>I didn\u2019t find out until years later \u2013 when interviewing Robert Lustig, author of Fat Chance \u2013 what appetite actually is. It is a primal force. If your body thinks you\u2019re starving (information it will get from hormones, not counting calories) it will override any other imperative until you\u2019re not. And that hormonal mechanism, the one that tells the body, \u201cI\u2019m starving and I need to conserve energy\u201d (or, \u201cI\u2019m not starving and I have energy to burn\u201d) is strongly influenced by fructose. Not only can you not diet in the first \u2013 orexigenic \u2013 state, it is cruel even to ask you to try. It would be like asking your body not to pick up your baby when it\u2019s in danger.</p> <p>Willpower is a redundant concept in nutrition. It is basically a pipeline issue: you can get ahead of your appetite by working on your blood glucose (not eating refined sugar; eating foods with a low glycemic index, which release sugar more slowly) or your state of mind; but once the clarion call is sounded, your body wants what it wants. </p> <h2><strong>3 </strong><strong>Sometimes you think you want to diet. You\u2019re wrong</strong></h2> <p>In 2013, I went to a conference on obesity, and learned something revelatory. Professor David Haslam, now chair of the National Obesity Forum, said that five minutes of vigorous masturbation used 300 calories. Everyone in the room was agape, yet none of us had the nous to ask, is that for a man or a woman? Sorry, that wasn\u2019t the revelation; I was just passing it on for your information; you could do that twice a day instead of spin.</p> <p>The actual revelation was the sheer weight of opinion from psychologists and behaviourists about what obesity was: it was not ignorance; still less was it greed. It was a compulsive behaviour. One researcher, Jane Dalgliesh, described this quite plainly: \u201cWe used the Stirling Eating Disorder Scales, and when we used the scales to assess an obese client, we could have been looking at patients with anorexia or bulimia. The psychopathology was very similar.\u201d Another said she\u2019d never met a morbidly obese patient who didn\u2019t have severe trauma in their past. Alice Mackintosh, nutritionist and co-author of The Happy Kitchen, tends to see patients for anything but weight loss, but observes that the few who do want that \u201cleave feeling really good \u2013 and then they just can\u2019t do it. They don\u2019t need a nutritionist. They need a coach, a therapist. They need to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Often, you think you need to diet when actually you need to self-soothe, which is just therapy speak for stop hating yourself. The more you try and fail to diet, the more you hate yourself.</p> <h2><strong>4 Inclusions are more important than exclusions</strong></h2> <p>I went to a nutritionist for the first time in 1999 (for a piece!). She was disturbingly perfect, neat and serene. With no visible pores nor the slightest blemish, she looked like an airbrushed photograph of herself. Her prescription was: no wheat, no meat, no sugar, no salt, no dairy. It was the age of exclusions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019re aiming not for nutritional purity, but for a diverse microbial gut-garden</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sure, it makes you quite thin, because your casual eating, your pork scratchings, your Pret sandwich, your someone-else\u2019s-chips is disrupted. But there are bigger problems with exclusions than the futility of self-denial: probably the most important development on nutrition this decade has been Tim Spector\u2019s book The Diet Myth, which describes the importance of variety in the gut biome. His abiding conclusion is the idiosyncrasy of every gut; there probably isn\u2019t a single diet that would work on even the majority of people; and, with the exception of very highly refined foods, which do nothing for variety, it\u2019s much more important to get weird stuff into your diet than it is to remove anything from it.</p> <p>You\u2019re aiming not for nutritional purity, but for a diverse microbial gut-garden. So, that\u2019s any cheese not made in a highly clinical environment, yoghurt, Portuguese fermented sausages, seaweed, unusual mushrooms, kimchee, kombucha, anything you can imagine would have grown hair if you\u2019d left it any longer.</p> <h2><strong>5 Fat doesn\u2019t make you fat</strong></h2> <p>In 1996, I was 23, and working at the London Evening Standard. The Atkins diet was relatively well-established in the US (Atkins Nutritionals had been founded in 1989) but had only recently arrived here, and Jesus, had it. It was not at all unusual to go looking for a piece of paper on someone\u2019s desk and turn up a shrink-wrapped steak that had been there for a month and was green.</p> <p>Now officially classified as a \u201cfad\u201d diet, Atkins\u2019s eating plan claimed strong foundations in science: cutting out all carbohydrates took you into ketosis, a state in which you metabolise fat at a faster rate, in contrast to glycolysis, where your energy comes from blood glucose. The diet was discredited (mainly when Atkins himself died and everyone said it was a heart attack, a consequence of his own mad diet; this was a myth, probably started mischievously \u2013 it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/apr/18/2\" title=\"\">actually a head injury</a>). But the diet flagged something important, by not making sense. With a packet of cashews, you could disappear 600 calories in five minutes, and still lose weight. All I ate was cheese. I wasn\u2019t thin, but I wasn\u2019t getting fatter, which is incredible, given how much I drank.</p> <p>Fat makes you full, and sugar makes you fat: the worst thing you can do to yourself is follow a low-fat diet, since, especially in prepared foods, the manufacturers boost the sugar to make up for the fat, leaving you fat and still hungry. Cardiologist Aseem Malhotra explains: \u201cThe emphasis on low fat has been the direct cause of obesity and type 2 diabetes. We should focus on sugar and refined carbs. Most cholesterol is produced in the liver. When people consume too much sugar and too many refined carbs, it causes the liver to produce more fats and a process called insulin resistance.\u201d</p> <p>Atkins does work: the question is, how long for? Because it is tremendously hard to stick to. Less difficult would be to take the no-sugar element, keep the fat free-for-all, and add more roughage, as in <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/what-pioppi-diet\" title=\"\">Malhotra\u2019s Pioppi Diet</a>.</p> <h2><strong>6 Fasting is good for you</strong></h2> <p>In 2007, I got pregnant. My appetite was incredible, compulsive, towering. It could have been a truly enjoyable phase, a sensory adventure. The deliciousness of everything was so intense, it was like tasting in technicolour. But I didn\u2019t enjoy it because I was repelled by my ungovernable self; every single day I\u2019d wake up with some new intention \u2013 only protein, only wholefoods, for the love of God, at least no sugar. And every day by 11am, I\u2019d be walking past a Greggs, gaping at the Tottenham cake, thinking, \u201cWhat must it taste like, though? That beautiful pink icing. That sandy sponge, lighter than air. How would it be, in my mouth? What mad pleasure could that unleash?\u201d I\u2019d walk in bewitched, leading with my feet, like a cartoon. To this day, walking past a Greggs puts me in a good mood.</p> <p>I put on 4st in the first trimester, and landed on the other side probably 5st overweight. To which the answer was: absolutely no fucking way. I\u2019ve already fallen off the face of the earth, and the only appointments I go to are ones where people call me \u201cmum\u201d and not my name. I am not ready for the world of elastication and invisibility. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the fault of the patriarchy.</p> <p>Then I discovered the Cambridge diet, which having been around since the 80s, is an archaic, intimate business, somewhere between seeing an Avon lady and buying contraband Cohibas in Havana. You had to find a practitioner on the internet and go to her house (it is always a her), and she would weigh you and sell you a bunch of milkshakes and powdered soups in small quantities, and you\u2019d have to go back regularly so she could check you were normal, and, I tell you, it works. After all I\u2019ve said about appetite being uncontrollable, there is good evidence that people find it much easier to fast, either with fake food (meal replacements) or in short bursts (the 5:2 diet, also madly effective), than they do to simply eat less.</p> <p>Mackintosh, the nutritionist, spells out the physiological benefits of the fast: \u201cMigratory motor complexes [waves of electrical activity that sweep through the intestines] can\u2019t work unless you\u2019re in a fasting state. It also has been shown to reduce inflammation, and that is linked to insulin resistance. The body can do more of this housekeeping when you\u2019re in a fasting state.\u201d</p> <p>I was on the Cambridge diet, on and off, for six months, and I lost all 5st and then some. Intermittent fasting used to be both looked down on and considered dangerous by the medical establishment, something decent people didn\u2019t need to do, and that weak-minded people might allow to get out of hand. That has evolved, but Rebecca McMananmon, consultant dietician and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, advises it is still not recommended for teens, pregnant women or anyone with a history of an eating disorder. However, if there are no pre-existing medical conditions, there are no overt risks. </p> <p>It is somehow fitting that, when a diet finally arrived that worked for my weight-loss, it was also good for things unrelated: general health, immunity, mood. Almost as if those lies we\u2019d been telling since the 80s (\u201cSlimming? Me? No, I\u2019m doing this to clear my skin\u201d) finally became true. Since my fasting experiment, I have never thought about food and weight again, although I actively seek pickles for pleasure and would never let any seaweed go past me. A lot of the enduring obsession with diets is down to the sense that your body is this giant, incalculable mystery, constantly trying to trick you, as you trick it back.

      "bodyText": "1 We want to be thin but we lie about it Since I\u2019ve been a journalist, I\u2019ve done a ton of diets for one article or another. I never had to justify it, or explain what I think about my own body, and how that relates to other women\u2019s body images, and how the tension between living as a feminist and living as a woman in the world is resolved \u2013 because it was always for a piece. But I went on diets before I was a journalist, and I never admitted it, either. It was always something else: I\u2019m eating carbs eight hours apart from proteins because it\u2019s good for my skin. I\u2019m raw-fooding for spiritual reasons. These fermented foods are for my sluggish mood. To admit that you want to lose weight for its own sake (and this was even worse in the 80s, by the way) was unfeminist, unserious: you can\u2019t imagine Rosa Luxemburg worrying about her batwings. Then as now, it was impossible to overstate how much sheer approbation you got from being thin, from everyone: friends, colleagues, children, peers, people who hate you, people you\u2019ve just met, in-laws, bus drivers \u2013 the thinner you are, the more people mention it. When you are not thin, there is simply an absence of praise, a discreet silence. Vogue once ran an editorial (ironic, coming from them, but whatevs) saying \u201cwomen don\u2019t stay thin to please men; they stay thin to dominate other, fatter women\u201d. When I read it \u2013 at an impressionable age \u2013 it seemed so catty and stark that I thought it had to be true, except it\u2019s not. Women who stay thin do it because they are also human, and as such social; existing among other people is much more enjoyable when they audibly approve of you the entire time. You cannot politics your way out of that. So a double imperative lurks beneath every fad, every fake intolerance, every detox: be ashamed of your size, but also be ashamed of your shame, then cover the whole thing in silence. I think if we rejected the silence, that would be the first step towards saying, \u201cActually, all this shame is incredibly unfair.\u201d 2 Respect the power of your own body At school, everyone had an eating disorder. Once, someone had a genuine meltdown because she\u2019d bitten the skin around her fingers and accidentally swallowed it, and didn\u2019t know how many calories that was. We didn\u2019t have Google then. It was almost a requirement to be counting calories the entire time, and I could never figure out why I sucked at it so badly. One day I would eat nothing but a tin of tomatoes and some sugar-free jelly. The next, I\u2019d stop at every sweet shop between my school and my house (six miles of heavily built-up streets). Why I was so pathetic? Why couldn\u2019t I simply govern myself? This is a common theme in the obesity narrative: why can\u2019t those people just try harder? I didn\u2019t find out until years later \u2013 when interviewing Robert Lustig, author of Fat Chance \u2013 what appetite actually is. It is a primal force. If your body thinks you\u2019re starving (information it will get from hormones, not counting calories) it will override any other imperative until you\u2019re not. And that hormonal mechanism, the one that tells the body, \u201cI\u2019m starving and I need to conserve energy\u201d (or, \u201cI\u2019m not starving and I have energy to burn\u201d) is strongly influenced by fructose. Not only can you not diet in the first \u2013 orexigenic \u2013 state, it is cruel even to ask you to try. It would be like asking your body not to pick up your baby when it\u2019s in danger. Willpower is a redundant concept in nutrition. It is basically a pipeline issue: you can get ahead of your appetite by working on your blood glucose (not eating refined sugar; eating foods with a low glycemic index, which release sugar more slowly) or your state of mind; but once the clarion call is sounded, your body wants what it wants. 3 Sometimes you think you want to diet. You\u2019re wrong In 2013, I went to a conference on obesity, and learned something revelatory. Professor David Haslam, now chair of the National Obesity Forum, said that five minutes of vigorous masturbation used 300 calories. Everyone in the room was agape, yet none of us had the nous to ask, is that for a man or a woman? Sorry, that wasn\u2019t the revelation; I was just passing it on for your information; you could do that twice a day instead of spin. The actual revelation was the sheer weight of opinion from psychologists and behaviourists about what obesity was: it was not ignorance; still less was it greed. It was a compulsive behaviour. One researcher, Jane Dalgliesh, described this quite plainly: \u201cWe used the Stirling Eating Disorder Scales, and when we used the scales to assess an obese client, we could have been looking at patients with anorexia or bulimia. The psychopathology was very similar.\u201d Another said she\u2019d never met a morbidly obese patient who didn\u2019t have severe trauma in their past. Alice Mackintosh, nutritionist and co-author of The Happy Kitchen, tends to see patients for anything but weight loss, but observes that the few who do want that \u201cleave feeling really good \u2013 and then they just can\u2019t do it. They don\u2019t need a nutritionist. They need a coach, a therapist. They need to sleep.\u201d Often, you think you need to diet when actually you need to self-soothe, which is just therapy speak for stop hating yourself. The more you try and fail to diet, the more you hate yourself. 4 Inclusions are more important than exclusions I went to a nutritionist for the first time in 1999 (for a piece!). She was disturbingly perfect, neat and serene. With no visible pores nor the slightest blemish, she looked like an airbrushed photograph of herself. Her prescription was: no wheat, no meat, no sugar, no salt, no dairy. It was the age of exclusions. Sure, it makes you quite thin, because your casual eating, your pork scratchings, your Pret sandwich, your someone-else\u2019s-chips is disrupted. But there are bigger problems with exclusions than the futility of self-denial: probably the most important development on nutrition this decade has been Tim Spector\u2019s book The Diet Myth, which describes the importance of variety in the gut biome. His abiding conclusion is the idiosyncrasy of every gut; there probably isn\u2019t a single diet that would work on even the majority of people; and, with the exception of very highly refined foods, which do nothing for variety, it\u2019s much more important to get weird stuff into your diet than it is to remove anything from it. You\u2019re aiming not for nutritional purity, but for a diverse microbial gut-garden. So, that\u2019s any cheese not made in a highly clinical environment, yoghurt, Portuguese fermented sausages, seaweed, unusual mushrooms, kimchee, kombucha, anything you can imagine would have grown hair if you\u2019d left it any longer. 5 Fat doesn\u2019t make you fat In 1996, I was 23, and working at the London Evening Standard. The Atkins diet was relatively well-established in the US (Atkins Nutritionals had been founded in 1989) but had only recently arrived here, and Jesus, had it. It was not at all unusual to go looking for a piece of paper on someone\u2019s desk and turn up a shrink-wrapped steak that had been there for a month and was green. Now officially classified as a \u201cfad\u201d diet, Atkins\u2019s eating plan claimed strong foundations in science: cutting out all carbohydrates took you into ketosis, a state in which you metabolise fat at a faster rate, in contrast to glycolysis, where your energy comes from blood glucose. The diet was discredited (mainly when Atkins himself died and everyone said it was a heart attack, a consequence of his own mad diet; this was a myth, probably started mischievously \u2013 it was actually a head injury). But the diet flagged something important, by not making sense. With a packet of cashews, you could disappear 600 calories in five minutes, and still lose weight. All I ate was cheese. I wasn\u2019t thin, but I wasn\u2019t getting fatter, which is incredible, given how much I drank.

Because it is tremendously hard to stick to. Less difficult would be to take the no-sugar element, keep the fat free-for-all, and add more roughage, as in Malhotra\u2019s Pioppi Diet. 6 Fasting is good for you In 2007, I got pregnant.

Curran, who recovered from a shaky start to take the key wickets of Rassie van der Dussen and Quinton de Kock in the final session, was effusive in his praise of England\u2019s senior bowlers. \u201cThey were amazing,\u201d said Curran. \u201cIt was great to watch them bowl as a pair. They bowled that whole session in the middle and didn\u2019t take any wickets but didn\u2019t go for many runs. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think I probably got my wickets later in the day because of the pressure they built up. They showed why they\u2019re world class bowlers and it was great for me to watch and learn. \u201cI thought we bowled really well as a group and it was great for Jimmy to end with those two wickets with the new ball. In the morning the ball will still be pretty new and hopefully we can get our rewards quickly.\u201d",

So too, Adelaide United came from behind to worry an understaffed Sydney FC, who hung on late for the full three points.</p> <p>The Melbourne Renegades briefly threatened to upset their BBL 08 grand final opponents and cross-town rivals the Stars, but saw the wheels come off in a big way late in their innings.</p> <p>There were wins in the NBL for Melbourne United and the Sydney Kings to overcome some minor late season wobbles for the high-flyers, and plenty of top tennis action around Australia that will go late into the night.

The Central Coast traveled to Wellington looking to snap a bad run of three-straight losses against the Phoenix, and having struck the post twice, couldn\u2019t quite manage the late comeback. So too, Adelaide United came from behind to worry an understaffed Sydney FC, who hung on late for the full three points. The Melbourne Renegades briefly threatened to upset their BBL 08 grand final opponents and cross-town rivals the Stars, but saw the wheels come off in a big way late in their innings. There were wins in the NBL for Melbourne United and the Sydney Kings to overcome some minor late season wobbles for the high-flyers, and plenty of top tennis action around Australia that will go late into the night. Thanks for your company - that\u2019s Sportwatch! Some interesting results in the ATP Cup where we\u2019ve finally got both Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal on court (just not at the same venue). Serbia have taken a one-nil lead against South Africa with Dusan Lajovic prevailing over Lloyd Harris, 3-6, 7-6, 6-3 in Brisbane. In the number one single\u2019s match Ken Anderson and Djokovic have played out a pulsating first set, with that one currently locked in a tie-break at 6-6. In Perth, Nadal\u2019s compatriot Roberto Bautista Agut made short work of his Georgian counterpart Alexsandre Metreveli, sweeping the court 6-0, 6-0. Nikoloz Basilashvili making a brighter start against the big-name Spaniard, breaking Nadal\u2019s first service game, but already it\u2019s swung back to 2-1 in favour of the world No 1. Marcus Stoinis finishes with 68* and Glenn Maxwell 40*. (Are you watching, Australian T20 selectors?) The Stars remain top of the ladder, picking up their fifth win in six, while for the Renegades it\u2019s a horrorshow title defence, as they go 0-6 and stay rooted to the bottom of the table. This one could be a bit of a morale buster - the manner in which the wickets slumped late on will be a huge concern for coach Klinger. But credit the Stars bowlers, Steyn, Zampa and Lamichhane all getting among the wickets. Big Bash - Stars 2/137 (18), Stoinis 64*, Maxwell 38* There will be no half century for Maxi, with just 12 left to get and Stoinis on strike. They tick along pretty easily, the Stars - not too much tension out there as they set up the final overs with just 6 to get off 12. Big Bash - Stars 2/125 (16), Stoinis 58*, Maxwell 32* It looked a decent over from Tom Andrews before Glen Maxwell dropped a reverse sweep over the rope for six! A ridiculous shot - almost a switch hit - and the just shy of 55,000 crowd absolutely loved it. Next over he slides Richardson down to deep backward point, and then Stoinis swats one aggressively away for another four. They\u2019re doing it easily now, the Stars. Eighteen to get off the last four overs. Big Bash - Stars 2/103 (14), Stoinis 50*, Maxwell 18* Just six off the over, in which Stonis brings up his half-century. A third during a Melbourne derby. Six fours and a single six - he flew out of the blocks but has settled into his innings a little since then. This is where it all fell apart for the Renegades. Let\u2019s see what the stars can muster. Big Bash - Stars 2/92 (12), Stoinis 44*, Maxwell 13* Two fours off the bowling of Gleeson and suddenly its Maxi who\u2019s escalating this run chase. They had briefly dipped below the Renegades\u2019 line after that fast start from Stoinis. He\u2019s gone more into his shell - no boundaries from overs 5-10 - but he\u2019s still moving well enough. Big Bash - Stars 2/77 (10), Stoinis 43*, Maxwell 1* And at the halfway mark, it\u2019s not a dissimilar score: Renegades were 2/72 at the same stage. The big difference as we know, is what happened from here in the Renegades innings - but if they can pick up the skipper cheaply and add another wicket or too, could this one tighten right up? Maddinson (17 off 13) and Dunk (15 off 13) are the two back in the pavilion, but it\u2019s the two at the crease that the Renegades will be worried about. It\u2019s five minutes added on, but despite twenty shots on goal, Adelaide struggle to work Sydney\u2019s goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne unduly. Ben Halloran tries a cheeky lob, but it\u2019s a safe take in the end for the one-cap Socceroo. Swivel sets up Le Fondre for a coup de grace, but the Englishman blazes wide! At the other end James Troisi tries to twist and turn in the box, but there\u2019s the final whistle. A remarkable twelfth-straight win at home in Kogarah as Sydney FC\u2019s relentless premiership tilt marches on. A-League - 87 min: Sydney FC bring on youngster Jordy Swivel for an A-League debut, and within seconds he\u2019s almost put the home side two goals ahead! It\u2019s another fine save from Paul Izzo - what\u2019s that, an eighth or ninth save of the evening? He\u2019s been immense, the Reds custodian. A-League - 81 min: It\u2019s still 35C, even though we\u2019re after 9pm in Sydney local time, and with a change of wind, there\u2019s now smoke haze blowing across Kogarah Oval. Tough conditions. A credit to both sets of players for making a fair spectacle of this situation. A-League - 75 min: Having played for so long with ten men against City last week, and with sweltering (and smoky) conditions tonight there\u2019s no surprises that Sydney FC are starting to look a little short of puff. They go to the bench, and it\u2019s Michael Zullo who comes on as a make-shift right back, for youngster van der Saag. Adelaide with just the one change so far - the Norwegian striker Opseth on for the goalscorer McGree. A striker for a midfielder, can they chase this one down? Big Bash - Stars 0/41 (3), Stoinis 26*, Maddinson 14* And like that, they\u2019re down to a run a ball - 1o2 needed off 102. Stoinis has really gone after the Englishman Richard Gleeson, but in fairness, they\u2019ve taken 14, 14, and 13 to start this innings. Look, early days, but I\u2019m calling goodnight nurse. Too much quality batting to come, and too many dropped Renegades heads already. This looks like the top v bottom clash that it is. A-League - 63 min: Sydney earn a corner as Izzo is forced into a smart save to deny Barbarouses. Isn\u2019t he having a bright start to his first season with his new club (with apologies to Victory and Phoenix supporters). Big Bash - Stars 0/14 (1), Stoinis 13*, Maddinson 1* So, they\u2019ve not wasted any time in going after this very gettable total, the Stars. Stoinis smashes the first ball to the rope, and then finishes the over in the same style. Real challenges for the Renegades skipper Finch to try and tighten this run chase. A-League - 55 min: The stats tell you that Adelaide have 55% of the possession, but that\u2019s not unusual given Sydney\u2019s skill in transition that the home side often allow their hosts to have it. The Reds enjoying a good little patch at this stage though, Sydney are struggling to get to grips with them in midfield. As we\u2019ve published over the past few days there are plenty from the tennis world adding their voices to fundraising efforts in the face of Australia\u2019s catastrophic bushfires: Nick Kyrgios, Sam Stosur and Alex De Minaur adding their voices to the campaign, and inspiring sportsmen from other codes (Chris Lynn - Big Bash, Matt Jurman - A-League, and many more) to help out. Great to see. A-League - Sydney FC 2-1 Adelaide United - second half! 45 min: And we\u2019re back underway in Kogarah, can the Sky Blues close this one out and pick up their eighth win in nine matches? It\u2019s been an incredible run since that shock round three derby loss to the now languishing Wanderers. And some late excitement at the ATP Cup, where there\u2019s an engrossing battle between Dennis Novak and Marin Cilic in what\u2019s called the number two singles match. The Austrian took a shock first set 7-6, before the giant-serving Croat fought back 4-6. He\u2019s just saved a match point with Cilic serving for 6-4 in the third and final set, but will it only stay the inevitable? Yes - there it is at the second time of offering: Cilic claims it 6-7, 6-4, 6-4. It gives Croatia a key 1-0 lead against Austria - what a match up Coric v Thiem now looms as. Big Bash - End of innings: Renegades 9/142 (20) It ends with a whimper after a reasonable few overs from Finch, Marsh and Webster. But as they have all season, they\u2019ve failed to see it out, the Renegades. Dale Steyn ruthless at the death picking up a few wickets and knocking over a runout. Good opportunity for the Stars to register another comfortable win - but, as they say - you can never be too certain in Big Bash cricket. Big Bash - Renegades 7/127 (18), Sutherland 5*, Andrews 1* My oh my. It\u2019s another first ball duck - and this time it\u2019s Dale Steyn with the wicket. Imagine having the luxury of a bowler like this. A wicket and just two off the over. In the 18th over. They\u2019ve lost 5 for 10 and the wheels have well and truly come off this Renegades innings. And to think if this ends a meager total, they\u2019ve only got Glen Maxwell to chase it down. Yikes. A-League - Sydney FC 2-1 Adelaide United - half-time 45 min: The fourth official shows four added minutes, in a half that\u2019s really see-sawed. It was the Reds who looked the goods first 10-15 minutes before Sydney really came into their own - grabbing two goals to crown their attacking dominance. But that set piece reply has given Adelaide a little confidence, and they go into the sheds with something to play for. No surprises, the midfield duo of McGree and Troisi have been prominent. Big Bash - Renegades 4/119 (15), Webster 29*, Cooper 0* And they\u2019ve put the skids on here, as Christian falls first ball! A double wicket over from Sandeep Lamichhane. And suddenly they\u2019ve lost all that momentum. And bad to worse, as Zampa picks up Webster! He attempts the horizontal bat stroke on the wrong-un\u2019 and it\u2019s gone straight through the gate - just how he picked up Finch! That\u2019s both set batsmen gone and a mini run of 3/3 - does this set up the Stars for victory? A-League - Goal! Sydney FC 2-1 Adelaide United (McGree) 38 min: Can you believe it! It\u2019s a seventh of the season for the midfielder McGree - that\u2019s better than almost all the competition\u2019s strikers outside of Le Fondre and Maclaren - as he slides in to tuck home an inch-perfect set piece delivery from James Troisi. Can this be the spark for the Reds?! Big Bash - Wicket! Renegades 3/117 (14.3), Marsh 43 out Breakthrough! It\u2019s terrific work on the boundary from Ben Dunk who reels in the big hit from Marsh, before flicking it back to find his teammate Coulter-Nile! Wonderful stuff, he was in danger of running it over the rope, but he showed great awareness - and suddenly the Stars have their man. Big Bash - Renegades 2/115 (14), Marsh 42*, Webster 27* Hello. It was calm stuff in the time out from Michael Klinger, clarifying each other\u2019s roles in setting the platform - but both Marsh and Webster have stepped up here, and hit some big overs. It\u2019s sixty off forty now in this partnership. Can they really explode from here, the Renegades?! A-League - Goal! Sydney FC 2-0 Adelaide United (Retre) 26 min: Oh my. It\u2019s raining Retre! It\u2019s a slick move down Sydney\u2019s right, and Baumjohann does brilliantly to shake his would-be defender before picking out Barbarouses. He lays it off for the late-arriving midfielder, and it\u2019s a thumping finish! He looks a natural scorer, this lad - who needs Le Fondre! A-League - Goal! Sydney FC 1-0 Adelaide United (Retre) 20 min: And after a slow start it\u2019s the table-toppers who have sprung to life. A flurry of good chances comes their way, and eventually it\u2019s the utility, Paulo Retre, who tucks home with the volley at the second attempt after the headed effort of youngster Harry van der Saag was rebuffed. Just his third ever A-League goal, and remarkably his first for Sydney FC. Big Bash - Renegades 2/72 (10), Marsh 20*, Webster 8* So at the halfway mark it\u2019s a modest start (by T20 standards) from the Renegades. With Finch gone, you\u2019d imagine Marsh is the one to step up in the big-hitting department. Still plenty who can wield a willow in their line up (Dan Christian springs to mind) so wickets aren\u2019t the issue at this stage. And if you\u2019re having Test cricket withdrawals in the hour or so since the Sydney Test reached stumps, fear not - we\u2019ve live action from South Africa where it\u2019s the English tail looking to survive. Another Australian OBOer on the controls there, join Adam Collins for the latest: A-League - 11 min: They\u2019ve hardly been in the contest so far, but it\u2019s Sydney FC who almost open the scoring, but for a terrific save from Paul Izzo! It was Barbarouses with the improvised, sharp toe-poked finish, but the Reds custodian threw out his right boot and deflected the shot wide. Close! Big Bash - Wicket! Renegades 2/55 (7.3), Finch 25 out And there it is! Zampa has the breakthrough, he\u2019s cleaned up Finch for 25 off 24! He took a while to get going, the skipper, but two thumping sixes warned he was ready to post a big one. But the spinner had other ideas. Beau Webster comes to the crease, with Marsh at the other end on 11*. A-League - 5 min: The Reds have the ball in the back of the net - is that the opener? No! George Blackwood\u2019s headed effort is ruled out for offside - just moments after right back Ryan Strain\u2019s thumping effort rattles the post! Fair to say, it\u2019s been a bright start for the visiting side. A-League: Sydney FC v Adelaide United - kickoff! 1 min: And we\u2019re underway from Kogarah, Sydney FC\u2019s home-near-home while the Sydney Football Stadium undergoes a major rebuild. Given the decent crowds (and presumably much more affordable rent) will they even return? A conversation to file under: watch this space. Big Bash: Renegades 1/32 (5), Finch 10*, Marsh 6* So much of the hopes for the Renegades this season rests on the shoulders of these two batsmen, and once again - there\u2019s an early wicket at the head of an innings. Sam Harper the man to go second over off the bowling of Nathan Coulter-Niles for 12. You\u2019d have to say, it\u2019s a slow start - but if anyone can turn it around it\u2019s these two. Here\u2019s the A-League team news for the late fixture - and there\u2019s a big in for Adelaide, and a big out for Sydney FC: No, not Ivanovic - I\u2019m talking about no Milos Ninkovic for the Sky Blues. And here\u2019s the Reds XI who welcome back key goalscoring midfielder Riley McGree: As mentioned in the preamble, there\u2019s ATP Cup action happening in three cities around Australia - Perth, Brisbane and Sydney, where the big drawcards Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal are set to be in action later. As our eyes at the ground Kevin Mitchell point out though, the scheduling does make for some late evenings - for players and fans alike: The home side look to eat up the remaining seconds, and as Mariners\u2019 goalkeeper Birighitti misses finding a teammate, they caress the ball round before Payne draws a freekick. And there\u2019s the final whistle! It\u2019s eight-straight undefeated for the Phoenix who jump up to fourth on the A-League ladder. A-League - 89 min: The strength of Simon creates another shooting opportunity for his teammate, De Silva - but he drags it wide! He rolls his eyes to the heavens, but in truth, it was another decent chance. Four minutes will be added on. Still time enough for an equaliser. A-League - 86 min: And it\u2019s a lightning counter-attack from the home side, and Cacace rolls a ball back across the face for Davila - but just as he goes to pull the trigger it\u2019s cleared by a desperate lunge from Clisby! That\u2019s a goal-saving last intervention. Fine work from the fullback. Big Bash - Stars v Renegades: And we\u2019re not too far away from the Big Bash all-Melbourne clash, where the Stars have won the toss, and put their rivals in to bat first. They didn\u2019t make too good a fist of it last time out against the Thunder, can the winless Renegades finally come good tonight? A-League - 82 min: On comes Matt Simon, the Mariners\u2019 veteran skipper - and it\u2019s his 250th A-League appearance to boot. He moves to the top of the attack, and he\u2019s involved as Central Coast fashion what should have been the equaliser! De Silva is through on goal, and he looks to curl it - but pushes his effort wide of Marinovic\u2019s goal! What a let-off. A-League - 77 min: It\u2019s a very vocal Ufuk Talay on the sideline. He\u2019s adjusted his formation to try and wrest back some dominance in midfield. The game has stretched end-to-end, so don\u2019t rule out a possible third goal for the Nix. Both sides have created plenty of chances today - but you\u2019d argue Wellington have marginally shaded it in that regard: six shots on target to Mariners\u2019 three. A-League: Wellington Phoenix 2-1 Central Coast - 70\u2019 So, let\u2019s pick up the final stages of our first of two A-League clashes today, where it\u2019s a spirited finish to a lively contest in Wellington. The Phoenix hit the lead comfortably inside half an hour with goals through \u201cSuper Dooper\u201d Gary Hooper and compatriot David Ball - but an own goal in the shadow of half-time gave the Mariners some hope. And they\u2019re finishing the stronger of the two right now. Can they dig out a point at the Cake Tin? And here\u2019s the third Test stumps report from day two. Perhaps for the first time all series it\u2019s nicely poised in Sydney. Yes, Marnus\u2019 has smashed 200+, but the NZ quicks fought back well, and if Toms Latham and Blundell can stay together tomorrow, could the Test stay lively as the pitch breaks up? Hi all! I trust this finds you well - safe and sound across Australia on another horrific weather day. The smoke is keeping at bay at the SCG where we\u2019ve just had stumps on day two of the third Test. Report to come from there shortly. And we\u2019re back underway in Wellington in the A-League - more on that soon as well. In the interim here\u2019s how the final overs went down, courtesy my colleague JP Howcroft: It\u2019s cricket and football time. What is it - summer in Australia? As the third Test rumbles on in Sydney, we\u2019ll be keeping eyes across the battle of the Melbourne Big Bash outfits - where it\u2019s very different stories for last year\u2019s finalists the Stars and Renegades so far - our front and back markers respectively in BBL 09. In the A-League its the story of two teams on decent undefeated runs. First up, Wellington Phoenix host Central Coast Mariners looking to go eight without a loss, before Sydney FC host Adelaide United looking for a remarkable eight wins from their past nine matches (the only exception: a draw with Wellington Phoenix). There\u2019s tennis from the ATP Cup where Serbia\u2019s Novak Djokovic and Spain\u2019s Rafael Nadal will be in action in Brisbane and Perth respectively, and as always, plenty more from elsewhere. Drop us a line to chat about your favourite Australasian sports action this weekend and we\u2019ll try and get across it.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Plant this</strong> Witch hazels are one of the earliest things to flower every year, their scented, spidery flowers in citrus shades unfurling to lure you into the garden for a sniff. These tolerant, hardy, slow-growing shrubs will do well in full sun or part shade. My favourite is \u2018Jelena\u2019 with its burnt-orange blooms.</p> <p><strong>Note this</strong> If the new year has filled you with anticipation for the growing season, it\u2019s time to get organised. <a href=\"https://thegreenconspiracy.com/product/tgc-garden-journal/\" title=\"\">Green Conspiracy\u2019s Garden Journal</a>, is a beautifully designed notebook to record all your ideas.</p> <p><strong>Sow this</strong> Not much can be sown this early, but sweet peas are a welcome exception.

      "body": "<p>It has long been a source of amusement to my friends that I have maintained such a hefty bulk despite my veganism. It is true: I have taken being vegan as a sign that I shouldn\u2019t deprive myself any further, and am guilty of gravitating towards the junk food end of the plant-based spectrum. I once ate four huge filled doughnuts in one sitting on the basis that vegans rarely get nice doughnuts, and \u201cthey were probably made of kale or something\u201d.</p> <p>A year ago, I decided something had to be done. My father died of a heart attack, and my body shape ticked all the boxes of someone headed the same way. There was another issue. My dissatisfaction with the way I look means I tend to wear one or two more layers of clothing than the season dictates. I can often be found at a bar sweating profusely, which, besides preferring the Crawley Pizza Express to the Woking branch, is another degree of separation I am proud to have from Prince Andrew.</p> <p>I have had issues with my body all my life. I was a fat child and only lost weight during my A-levels, enjoying a three-year stint of being \u201cskinny\u201d. This generated a sense of euphoria similar to how Chesney Hawkes must have felt for the three years that followed the release <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/may/22/how-we-made-chesney-hawkes-the-one-and-only\" title=\"t\">The </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/may/22/how-we-made-chesney-hawkes-the-one-and-only\" title=\"t\">One </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/may/22/how-we-made-chesney-hawkes-the-one-and-only\" title=\"t\">And Only</a>. I then piled it all back on at university. The girl I was seeing at the time found my weight gain fairly unappealing, leading to a campaign by her and her friends to \u201chint\u201d me into losing it. </p> <p>All this has left me with an ongoing hangup about my physique. I remember the first time I took my top off on television. When the show aired, somebody tweeted to complain that as a result of watching me she had been unable to finish her dinner. I assume she didn\u2019t mean because she was so sexually aroused.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I bought a Wu-Tang Clan T-shirt so tight I feared it might lead to a cease-and-desist order</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last year, I decided to set myself a goal, one that involved a very simple metric: a Wu-Tang Clan T-shirt I had bought online from the US. When it arrived, I realised that it looked so ridiculous that wearing it might lead to a cease-and-desist order from the group for fear that my doughy body squeezed into their merch could damage the brand. I decided that my goal was to be able to wear that T-shirt in public without feeling ashamed. I was not even allowed to do the bigger-man trick of wearing it under an open shirt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bf8eefb16e1b62d489585443346b4eedfe0619c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bf8eefb16e1b62d489585443346b4eedfe0619c/224_1338_5488_6858/800.jpg\" alt=\"Romesh Ranganathan\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I have, of course, tried to lose weight many times, and succeeded \u2013 only to put it straight back on.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pal Hansen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have, of course, tried to lose weight many times, and succeeded \u2013 only to put it straight back on. I wanted this to be different, so I resolved to make changes that would be sustainable. I have done 1,200-calorie days and hit the gym hard, and you get results quickly; but I also quickly feel miserable (for me, usually around day two). I fall off the wagon badly, before eating the wagon in its entirety. This time I accepted that some of the things I was going to try would fail. I had to: based on the evidence of the past, everything would fail.</p> <p>First I decided to get a personal trainer. Although expensive compared with going to the gym alone, it was necessary because my levels of self-discipline are pathetically low. For example: only six paragraphs into this article, I have stopped for an hour to watch the second half of Jurassic World on TV. When the film ended with a mosasaurus emerging from the water to chow down on the lab-created Indominus rex, it made want to have a large snack, which I went off and did. In the same way, when I go to the gym, I can often be found doing three reps of something before looking at my phone, messing with the settings on my headphones, and then trapping someone in conversation by a treadmill until they ask to be left alone.</p> <p>A personal trainer forces you to use all the strange equipment that you would otherwise avoid. My local gym is filled with people I consider experts, who do those weird exercises that you see in Rocky montages, flailing ropes and standing on one leg while you throw a large sack at the ground repeatedly, before pushing a sled up and down the gym like a \u2019roided husky.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I couldn't tell David I was dying, which meant we often had to take a break because I had started crying</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My own trainer, David, is an Adonis. He once posted a photograph on Facebook to show how badly he had let himself go over Christmas: it was such an incredible example of the human physique that I nearly saved it as my wallpaper. Rather than doing an exercise and then looking at my phone for 10 minutes, David had me exercising continually. We would move from one station to the next, me sweating even more than a fat man wearing too many layers of clothing in the summer. I also had the blessing or misfortune of not feeling comfortable enough with David to tell him I was dying, which meant that I would often be in the middle of a set and David would tell me to take a break because it\u2019s not normal to be crying.</p> <p>To avoid messing up a busy day, I had to do the sessions early in the morning, often meeting David at 6am. Any later would have meant not taking my kids to school, which I don\u2019t get the chance to do as much as I\u2019d like. It seemed counterintuitive: I was exercising so I could be around longer for my kids, but I was doing it during the time that I could have been spending with them now.</p> <p>I would go to bed late after work, panicked about having to get up in four hours, then lie in bed fully awake until it was time for the personal-training session. I would go and exercise, feel great about what I had achieved for the next hour, and then spend the rest of the day feeling shattered. The breaking point was when I realised that I could cancel at the last minute, as long as I paid for the session. I was soon paying a lot of money to wake up and text a man to say that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to see him, before going back to sleep.</p> <p>I tried a couple of other things. I started going to the gym on my own; I tried to run; I did boxing training. Running was boring; I spent most of my gym time downloading albums on to my phone; and one day after boxing I threw up round the side of the house and felt so ill I was late for work. It wasn\u2019t exactly a sustainable way to keep fit, especially as there is only a finite number of things to keep being shit at.</p> <p>Then I discovered my saviour: a spin bike with a screen that lets you do classes online. That doesn\u2019t sound particularly enticing to a sloth, but it was perfect. I could do high-intensity classes, and all I had to do was go downstairs. You get little electronic badges for keeping up a streak, and a T-shirt when you complete 100 classes. There was an accompanying Facebook group full of people who post photos of themselves after a ride saying things like, \u201cGo, team!\u201d</p> <p>I felt pretty weird about doing something so culty, even before the creepy Peloton Christmas ad that looked a lot like a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/17/get-out-review-fantastically-twisted-horror-satire-on-race-in-america\" title=\"\">Get Out</a>. It is also supremely expensive, with a huge outlay on the bike, plus a gym membership-sized subscription \u2013 so much so that my wife and I had a meeting to discuss whether it was worth it, based on my predilection for abandoning everything. I found the conversation so unfair that I went and made a smoothie with the NutriBullet, which I eventually found behind my Slendertone Ab Tuning belt. However, the spin bike is the one form of exercise that has stuck.

I tried to take all of the decision-making out of my hands by having pre-prepared meals delivered. I would eat only three meals a day, plus water, and know exactly what my nutritional intake was. The food sounded very cool: dishes such as Sichuan tofu with spicy pak choi. It was tasty and convenient, but seemed like something a professional athlete would do rather than someone who occasionally uses an exercise bike. Also, it was a bit weird to rule yourself out of every social occasion that involved eating because you were living out of Tupperware boxes. But the main stumbling block, again, is that it is prohibitively expensive \u2013 exorbitant enough for my wife to start calling me Jay-Z.</p> <p>In the end, I settled on intermittent fasting. I am going to hold my hands up here: I don\u2019t understand the science behind it. You select eight hours of the day when you can eat, and fast for the other 16, sticking to zero-calorie drinks such as water or black coffee. After 12 hours of not eating, your body apparently goes into a state in which it\u2019s eating itself, or something. I don\u2019t know. What I do know is that I definitely benefited from reducing the number of hours in which I was allowed to take in calories. You can also, if you fancy, only do it six days a week and have a cheat day, although I made the mistake of deciding ad hoc when my cheat day was going to be, before eventually realising I had had seven cheat days out of the last 10. I knocked cheat days on the head.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am trying to stay healthy because it feels good; because eating better makes me better at work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I would love to tell you that the rest of the year was spent smashing out class after class, as I intermittently fasted my way to a set of chiselled abs and being sexy AF, but life got in the way.

I have to confess to finding hotel gyms horribly intimate. More often than not, they are like a cupboard with equipment inside.

On one occasion, another man seemed to be doing a circuit that involved every piece of equipment in a random order. I had to gamble and go for the thing I hoped he might not be using next.

It is as ridiculous as it sounds, but you do feel a bit of pride at having made the best of a bad situation.

Weeks have gone by where I was too knackered to do anything; once, I felt so sorry for myself that I ordered a vegan sticky toffee pudding to my room at 2am and ate it in the dark. And then went to sleep. And then woke up and found I had toffee on my chest. And then ate that toffee.</p> <p>But I have become much more conscious of my choices. When I make bad ones, I try to make some good ones for a while. I no longer see eating sticky toffee pudding at 2am as a terrible failure; it just means I need to balance that afterwards. I am by no means an exercise beast, but I do try to look for opportunities to work out when I can. Before, I would have described myself as \u201csedentary with occasional flurries of exertion\u201d.

Then straighten your back leg and stand up, putting your feet back together. Alternate between the right and left leg.</p> <h2>Tricep dips</h2> <p>With your back to a chair, move your hands behind you so you are holding the top of it and lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows.

      "bodyText": "It has long been a source of amusement to my friends that I have maintained such a hefty bulk despite my veganism. It is true: I have taken being vegan as a sign that I shouldn\u2019t deprive myself any further, and am guilty of gravitating towards the junk food end of the plant-based spectrum. I once ate four huge filled doughnuts in one sitting on the basis that vegans rarely get nice doughnuts, and \u201cthey were probably made of kale or something\u201d. A year ago, I decided something had to be done. My father died of a heart attack, and my body shape ticked all the boxes of someone headed the same way. There was another issue. My dissatisfaction with the way I look means I tend to wear one or two more layers of clothing than the season dictates. I can often be found at a bar sweating profusely, which, besides preferring the Crawley Pizza Express to the Woking branch, is another degree of separation I am proud to have from Prince Andrew. I have had issues with my body all my life. I was a fat child and only lost weight during my A-levels, enjoying a three-year stint of being \u201cskinny\u201d. This generated a sense of euphoria similar to how Chesney Hawkes must have felt for the three years that followed the release The One And Only. I then piled it all back on at university. The girl I was seeing at the time found my weight gain fairly unappealing, leading to a campaign by her and her friends to \u201chint\u201d me into losing it. All this has left me with an ongoing hangup about my physique. I remember the first time I took my top off on television. When the show aired, somebody tweeted to complain that as a result of watching me she had been unable to finish her dinner. I assume she didn\u2019t mean because she was so sexually aroused. Last year, I decided to set myself a goal, one that involved a very simple metric: a Wu-Tang Clan T-shirt I had bought online from the US. When it arrived, I realised that it looked so ridiculous that wearing it might lead to a cease-and-desist order from the group for fear that my doughy body squeezed into their merch could damage the brand. I decided that my goal was to be able to wear that T-shirt in public without feeling ashamed. I was not even allowed to do the bigger-man trick of wearing it under an open shirt. I have, of course, tried to lose weight many times, and succeeded \u2013 only to put it straight back on. I wanted this to be different, so I resolved to make changes that would be sustainable. I have done 1,200-calorie days and hit the gym hard, and you get results quickly; but I also quickly feel miserable (for me, usually around day two). I fall off the wagon badly, before eating the wagon in its entirety. This time I accepted that some of the things I was going to try would fail. I had to: based on the evidence of the past, everything would fail. First I decided to get a personal trainer. Although expensive compared with going to the gym alone, it was necessary because my levels of self-discipline are pathetically low. For example: only six paragraphs into this article, I have stopped for an hour to watch the second half of Jurassic World on TV. When the film ended with a mosasaurus emerging from the water to chow down on the lab-created Indominus rex, it made want to have a large snack, which I went off and did. In the same way, when I go to the gym, I can often be found doing three reps of something before looking at my phone, messing with the settings on my headphones, and then trapping someone in conversation by a treadmill until they ask to be left alone. A personal trainer forces you to use all the strange equipment that you would otherwise avoid. My local gym is filled with people I consider experts, who do those weird exercises that you see in Rocky montages, flailing ropes and standing on one leg while you throw a large sack at the ground repeatedly, before pushing a sled up and down the gym like a \u2019roided husky. My own trainer, David, is an Adonis. He once posted a photograph on Facebook to show how badly he had let himself go over Christmas: it was such an incredible example of the human physique that I nearly saved it as my wallpaper. Rather than doing an exercise and then looking at my phone for 10 minutes, David had me exercising continually. We would move from one station to the next, me sweating even more than a fat man wearing too many layers of clothing in the summer. I also had the blessing or misfortune of not feeling comfortable enough with David to tell him I was dying, which meant that I would often be in the middle of a set and David would tell me to take a break because it\u2019s not normal to be crying. To avoid messing up a busy day, I had to do the sessions early in the morning, often meeting David at 6am. Any later would have meant not taking my kids to school, which I don\u2019t get the chance to do as much as I\u2019d like. It seemed counterintuitive: I was exercising so I could be around longer for my kids, but I was doing it during the time that I could have been spending with them now. I would go to bed late after work, panicked about having to get up in four hours, then lie in bed fully awake until it was time for the personal-training session. I would go and exercise, feel great about what I had achieved for the next hour, and then spend the rest of the day feeling shattered. The breaking point was when I realised that I could cancel at the last minute, as long as I paid for the session. I was soon paying a lot of money to wake up and text a man to say that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to see him, before going back to sleep. I tried a couple of other things. I started going to the gym on my own; I tried to run; I did boxing training. Running was boring; I spent most of my gym time downloading albums on to my phone; and one day after boxing I threw up round the side of the house and felt so ill I was late for work. It wasn\u2019t exactly a sustainable way to keep fit, especially as there is only a finite number of things to keep being shit at. Then I discovered my saviour: a spin bike with a screen that lets you do classes online. That doesn\u2019t sound particularly enticing to a sloth, but it was perfect. I could do high-intensity classes, and all I had to do was go downstairs. You get little electronic badges for keeping up a streak, and a T-shirt when you complete 100 classes. There was an accompanying Facebook group full of people who post photos of themselves after a ride saying things like, \u201cGo, team!\u201d I felt pretty weird about doing something so culty, even before the creepy Peloton Christmas ad that looked a lot like a sequel to Get Out. It is also supremely expensive, with a huge outlay on the bike, plus a gym membership-sized subscription \u2013 so much so that my wife and I had a meeting to discuss whether it was worth it, based on my predilection for abandoning everything. I found the conversation so unfair that I went and made a smoothie with the NutriBullet, which I eventually found behind my Slendertone Ab Tuning belt. However, the spin bike is the one form of exercise that has stuck. It is difficult to find an excuse not to exercise in your own house (plus my wife has threatened to leave me if I stop using it).

      "bodyText": "Is your Christmas tree looking a little sad? One might imagine it is by now, for the ghost has truly flown, and left a flurry of needles on your floor. Still, let us not waste this moment to honour the tree\u2019s life with a good bit of recycling. If I am honest, I don\u2019t have a tree to recycle because I am not a fan of the Christmas tree tradition. So mostly I have to steal other people\u2019s trees. I go around collecting up the corpses left out with the bins (clearly not the ones destined for the council recycling scheme) and take them back to my allotment. The needles of fir trees make excellent ericaceous compost, perfect for pleasing blueberries, cranberries, bilberries, heathers and azaleas. Depending on your tree, this might be as simple as sweeping up the fallen needles from the sitting room. If you have a fancy tree that\u2019s been bred to never let go, snip off the branches from the main trunk. If you have access to a garden shredder this will speed things up no end. Otherwise chop by hand into smaller pieces, then scatter around the base of your ericaceous plants and let nature do her thing. You can also use the evergreen branches as frost protection; they are excellent for protecting perennial crowns. However, you may have nothing left other than bare twiggy stems and the trunk.

Who will finish in the top four? In the absence of anything resembling a close title race, the battle for the three remaining Champions League spots should provide some excitement and drama near the Premier League summit. Leicester and Manchester City have put enough daylight between themselves and the chasing posse to suggest they will occupy two of the berths available, but the chase for fourth spot looks to be between Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Wolves. It is Chelsea\u2019s to lose as they are in the box seat but, like their nearest rivals, they are dogged by inconsistency. Although Frank Lampard\u2019s side have not strung back-to-back league wins together since the first week of November, their grip on fourth has barely been loosened but a winning streak from any of the teams behind them would prompt some serious jitters. Still fewer than 10 points off the pace for fourth with a little under half the season to go, a reinvigorated Arsenal under the new management of Mikel Arteta might still fancy their chances of swooping with a sustained challenge while a place in the Europa League would have been beyond the wildest dreams of fans of Crystal Palace and Sheffield United before the season commenced. Is any mid-table side safe from the drop? Seventh on Christmas Day in 1995, Norwich ended up being relegated and that should prove a cautionary tale for any team outside the current top six suffering delusions of adequacy. This time last season Brighton were 10 points clear of the relegation zone but still needed to rely on the charity and shortcomings of others to finish just above the thick black line. Of the current top 10 Crystal Palace look most vulnerable to an admittedly unlikely collapse. Beyond that nobody is safe but fans of Everton, Southampton, Brighton and West Ham have various reasons to be confident of survival. Newcastle, in 13th, have just lost three matches in a row and, with their treatment room stuffed to the gunwales, find themselves on a slide that shows no sign of being arrested any time soon. Mike Ashley, their famously parsimonious owner, may have to dig deep this month if he is to keep them in the top flight for yet another season fraught with the now traditional peril, disillusionment and rancour. Considering the return he has got from his summer outlay, even a January splurge might not be enough to save his team. Who will get relegated? Only three teams in the Premier League\u2019s 27 full seasons \u2013 West Brom, Sunderland and Leicester \u2013 have been bottom of the table on Christmas Day and avoided relegation but after steering the Foxes to unlikely survival in 2015 Nigel Pearson looks set fair to repeat the feat with Watford. Installed as the club\u2019s third manager of the season in early December, he masterminded three wins out of four over the festive period, lifting the club off the foot of the table on Boxing Day and providing genuine hope to the denizens of Vicarage Road. Norwich, the new bottom side, urgently need to start converting home leads into wins if they are to have any chance of extending their stay in the top flight. Dogged by injuries, a porous defence and out-of-form strikers, Bournemouth have taken only four points from the past 30 available and look destined for the drop after five years punching above their weight. Who will win the golden boot? Last season\u2019s competition ended in a three-way tie between Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Mohamed Salah on 22 each, a tally that looks likely to be beaten by the most prolific striker this time. A rank outsider before the season started, Jamie Vardy has 17 goals to his name already and is four clear of Danny Ings, who has been banging them in for a Southampton side that had until recently been struggling. After an astonishing streak of 11 goals in eight games, Vardy has endured a comparative drought, scoring just one in four before missing Leicester\u2019s past two matches. Level with Ings, Aubameyang seems likely to make even more hay while the sun is shining over the Emirates following the arrival of Arteta.",

      "bodyText": "Two more bushfire deaths on Kangaroo Island, in remote South Australia, have brought to 23 the number of people killed in fires across Australia this fire season, with six people still missing in fire-affected regions across New South Wales and Victoria. On Saturday, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced his government would send Australia\u2019s largest warship, HMAS Adelaide, to help evacuation efforts from towns on the Victorian coast cut-off by fires, compulsorily call up 3,000 army reservists to assist in fire recovery, and put $20m towards leasing four more water-bombing aircraft. Morrison has faced acute criticism over his government\u2019s inaction over the bushfires, some of which have been burning since September, and over his government\u2019s climate change policies, criticised as unambitious and ineffective in reducing emissions. Fanned by strong, changeable winds, temperatures above 40C and widespread drought conditions, some of the more than 200 fires are burning so powerfully they are forming their own weather systems, even causing lightning strikes sparking new blazes, through pyrocumulonimbus clouds. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, warned the state faced a \u201cvery volatile situation\u201d and that \u201cwe are yet to hit the worst of it\u201d. The state\u2019s transport minister, Andrew Constance, defending his own home against ember attack, told ABC radio \u201cthis isn\u2019t a bushfire, it\u2019s an atomic bomb\u201d. The bodies of the two people, identified as Dick Lang, 78, a bush pilot and safari operator, and his son Clayton, 43, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon, were found after fire burned through more than half of Kangaroo Island. The bodies were found inside a burned-out car on a highway. The fast-moving fire front appeared to have overrun the vehicle while the occupants were fleeing. \u201cIt has been absolutely devastating,\u201d the Kangaroo Island mayor, Michael Pengilly, told the ABC. \u201cThe north coast looks like it has been hit by a nuclear bomb. You can\u2019t stop this thing at the moment, it\u2019s bloody impossible.\u201d Australia\u2019s two most populous states, NSW and Victoria, have had their east coasts devastated by massive out-of-control fires that have destroyed more than 1,500 homes and claimed 23 lives so far. That number is predicted to rise. Six people remain missing but this figure is down from 28. Across the country, hundreds of thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes. The NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said on Saturday that 148 fires were burning across the state, 12 of which were at emergency warning alert level. Victoria\u2019s Emergency Management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said there were 53 fires across the state, with the vast majority of those in the eastern half of the state. Thirteen fires were at \u201cemergency warning\u201d level. There were also current fire warnings in Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. A sense of anxiety gripped NSW on Saturday, as the gruelling long-running catastrophe of the bushfire season rolled on. \u201cRight here, we are the meat in the sandwich,\u201d the RFS divisional commander, Mark Coombes, began a shift briefing of new volunteer firefighters at Nowra, on the NSW south coast, \u201cso thanks for coming down\u201d. Ringed by fire to the north and south \u2013 with flames 40 metres high, running through forest that hadn\u2019t burned in decades \u2013 the crews of volunteer and professional firefighters prepared for the fourth, and in forecast most serious, of the extreme days the state had faced already this summer. \u201cThe southerly is going to hit around 9pm, 9.30pm and unfortunately you\u2019re the ones that [have to] deal with it,\u201d Coombes said. \u201cWhat it\u2019s going to do I have no fucking idea.\u201d His info was off by about 90 minutes, and the southerly roared through the base with reported gusts up to 101 km/h, whipping up dirt and dust and ash, and filling the briefing room with smoke. On the outskirts of Adaminaby, a village of about 300 people in the Snowy Mountains in southern NSW, an acrid smoke turned the sky black by mid-afternoon and mud, dirt and ash rained from the sky while a small crew of volunteer firefighters fought two blazes approaching the town from the north and west. The Adaminaby Complex fire \u2013 which split into two sections \u2013 was one of five fires burning at an emergency warning level in the Snowy Mountains region and which cut electricity to large parts of the state. Glen Squire, the captain of the local Rural Fire Service brigade, told the Guardian his small crew of volunteers had been working for weeks to protect the town. But properties further into a dense forest of mountain ash trees were \u201cundefendable\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get people out there to leave for a while but some of them have stayed, I wouldn\u2019t want to be there,\u201d he said. Morrison said on Saturday that fire authorities were \u201cwell-prepared, well-organised and well-resourced\u201d but governments, fire crews and communities needed to be realistic and understand that some blazes would not be able to be stopped. \u201cThese fire conditions are unprecedented and the challenge is formidable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf fierce conditions prevail, today could be a dark day for our country.\u201d Morrison warned that, with no substantial rain forecast, the fires could burn for weeks, beyond the capability of fire crews to control or extinguish. \u201cThis length of season is, of course, in many senses, unprecedented, but the ferocity and the absence of dousing rains that would normally bring a season like this under greater control is nowhere in sight and so that means a much longer season is planned for.\u201d The compulsory call-up of army reserve troops to help bushfire-hit towns across the country survive the ongoing bushfire crisis and recover from its impacts is the first in Australia\u2019s history. Soldiers will provide \u201ccivil aid, humanitarian assistance, medical or civil emergency or disaster relief\u201d, the defence minister said in her order to troops. The governor general formally called up the defence force reservists for an open-ended commitment from Saturday \u201cuntil revoked\u201d. The Australian Defence Force will also provide accommodation to families who have lost their homes on defence force bases. National capital Canberra and the outer western Sydney suburb of Penrith both broke temperature records on Saturday that had stood for 80 years. The temperature reached 48.9C in Penrith and 44C in Canberra on Saturday afternoon, the hottest temperatures recorded in those areas.",

      "body": "<p>Poor Mary Bennet. It\u2019s hard not to feel her creator didn\u2019t like her very much. Jane Austen described <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> as \u201clight, bright and sparkling\u201d; but she didn\u2019t bestow any of these qualities on the unfortunate middle Bennet daughter. Unlike her sisters, Mary possesses neither looks, wit or charm. Her hard won \u201caccomplishments\u201d have only made her pompous and priggish. In a book in which even the characters we aren\u2019t supposed to admire fizz and pop with energy \u2013 step forward Lydia Bennet \u2013 only Mary fails to shine.</p> <p>So why choose her as the subject for a novel? On one level, I simply felt sorry for her. I\u2019d been a bookish young woman myself, with all the usual misgivings about how I appeared to the world. I would have loved to be her elder sister Elizabeth \u2013 handsome, assured and funny. But in truth, I suspected there was more than a little of Mary about me.</p> <p>But the same sympathy that drew me towards Mary made me reluctant to accept in its entirety Austen\u2019s version of her. The qualities that condemn her in <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> did not seem so heinous to me. I thought her efforts to educate herself, in the face of her family\u2019s indifference, commendable rather than ridiculous. And the earnestness that resulted from her lonely endeavours seemed rather sad and touching. The Mary I wanted to write about would look rather different from Austen\u2019s character. But could readers ever be convinced to accept her? Once a character is established as fundamentally unlikable, can anything be done to make us change our minds?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cd0602f180b921d846b5c903e2b4e48da3965ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cd0602f180b921d846b5c903e2b4e48da3965ff/90_520_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giles Terera as Aaron Burr (in black suit) in the West End production of Hamilton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giles Terera as Aaron Burr (in black suit) in the West End production of <em>Hamilton</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Murphy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve always believed that everything appears different if you can persuade readers to look at the world through that character\u2019s eyes. Even the most unlikely figures can be redeemed. I\u2019d seen this happen in one of the very first books I bought for myself, Rosemary Hawley Jarman\u2019s <em>We Speak No Treason</em>. I was swept away by Jarman\u2019s impassioned attempt to rescue Richard III from his dark status as one of the greatest villains in British history. I was thrilled by the idea that everything we thought we knew about Richard was wrong, that his character looked very different when viewed from the perspective of those who really knew him.</p> <p>I developed a taste for similarly provocative fictional re-evaluations, and devoured Robert Graves\u2019s <em>I, Claudius</em>, relishing the way in which the despised narrator is gradually revealed to be one of the cleverest and most cunning of the imperial Roman family. I returned again and again to Gore Vidal\u2019s bracingly astringent <em>Burr</em>, which told the story of one of the most reviled figures of the American revolution. As the man who shot Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr is now probably as famous as he\u2019s ever been, thanks to the musical <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/21/hamilton-review-musical-london-victoria-palace-lin-manuel-miranda\" title=\"\">Hamilton</a></em>. However, he\u2019s still seen as the bad guy \u2013 or baddish, at least.</p> <p>This wouldn\u2019t have worried Vidal very much, for unlike Jarman, it was never his intention to present the subject of his book as a hero. Jarman\u2019s whole purpose was to clear Richard\u2019s name, to present him as a victim of history. But for both Graves and Vidal, it was the moral ambiguity of their subjects that made them interesting. Their aim was not to whitewash them into goodness, but to enter into their hearts and minds and invite us to see the world from their bleakly pragmatic perspective. First we\u2019re intrigued; then we\u2019re immersed; and soon we find ourselves identifying with a character we\u2019d previously thought irredeemable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6bfc935ab14d102dc7d7ba2e4d14040086fec96e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bfc935ab14d102dc7d7ba2e4d14040086fec96e/0_0_2708_3192/848.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Sir Thomas Cromwell by Hans Holbein the Younger, 1532.\" width=\"848\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portrait of Sir Thomas Cromwell by Hans Holbein the Younger, 1532.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IanDagnall Computing/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For me, the greatest triumph of this genre is unquestionably Hilary Mantel\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/02/wolf-hall-hilary-mantel\" title=\"\">Wolf Hall</a></em>. After reading her seductive and nuanced picture of Thomas Cromwell it is impossible ever to think of him again just as Henry VIII\u2019s cold, calculating enforcer, the man with the unsettling stare who gazes out of Holbein\u2019s famous portrait. Mantel achieves this not by denying Cromwell\u2019s dark side \u2013 he remains, in her telling, a man with a profoundly elastic moral compass \u2013 but by giving him a credible and complex inner life that, when fully appreciated, allows us to understand, if not always to condone, his actions. There is, she seems to suggest, no single Cromwell for us to pin down. Like all of us, he has a variety of guises in which he presents himself to the world. Some are ruthless, some more benign. What you think of him will very much depend on which of those faces you encounter.</p> <p>It\u2019s noticeable that all the central characters in these revisionist retellings are based on real people \u2013 and that all of them are men. This shouldn\u2019t really surprise us. One of the purposes of these books is to make us think again about power and those who wield it. But there\u2019s another form of fictional reimagining that has sought to sidestep these limitations by turning away from the heart of the action. It looks instead towards characters relegated to the margins and invites them into the spotlight.</p> <p>Many of these new protagonists are drawn not from history but from familiar works of fiction \u2013 and many of them are women. A key example, and still one of the best, is Jean Rhys\u2019s <em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em>. In <em>Jane Eyre</em>, the first Mrs Rochester, insane and hidden from view, cannot bear witness to her experiences; all we hear from her are cries and screams. But Rhys lets her speak \u2013 and having heard her story, it is impossible to think of her any longer as merely the malign impediment to Jane\u2019s happy ending. We know now who Bertha Rochester is, and our feelings about her have shifted profoundly as a result.</p> <p>Pat Barker\u2019s <em>The Silence of the Girls</em> focuses on a different kind of voicelessness. Her book is loosely based on Homer\u2019s <em>Iliad</em>, but is very much not a narrative of classical heroes. Instead it introduces us to the women who trudge along silently at the edge of the original, the mothers, wives and daughters who are the collateral damage of a war between men. Barker lifts them out of their anonymity, and in doing so transforms how we think of them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3136f0d5c428650f3ec72bbcb0eb2e22eefe001f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3136f0d5c428650f3ec72bbcb0eb2e22eefe001f/0_0_1772_1724/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria Sibson as Bertha Mason and Javier Torres as Edward Rochester in Northern Ballet\u2019s Jane Eyre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"973\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria Sibson as Bertha Mason and Javier Torres as Edward Rochester in Northern Ballet\u2019s <em>Jane Eyre</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caroline Holden</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alice Randall\u2019s <em>The Wind Done Gone</em> explores the experience of a very different kind of dispossession. Taking its inspiration from <em>Gone With the Wind</em>, it turns away from the white-pillared plantation house and tells its story not from the perspective of the slave owners, but from the point of view of the enslaved. Randall\u2019s characters don\u2019t exist voicelessly in the background but stand full square before us. This turns an entire fictional landscape upside down, reshaping our sympathies in the process.</p> <p>But if shifting perspective can make us feel more benign towards one character, it also alters how we see those around them. In <em>Wolf Hall</em>, the saintly Thomas More takes on a far darker quality. George Washington is a lumpish untrustworthy manipulator in <em>Burr</em>. In writing my own book, I too found established characters taking on a new identity. In <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, Mary Bennet\u2019s mother is selfish, tactless and annoying \u2013 but her power over its heroine is limited. Elizabeth is too confident to be seriously affected by her mother\u2019s complaints. For Mary, however, who possesses none of the qualities her mother admires, Mrs Bennet is potentially a far more baleful presence, with the capacity to do real emotional damage. As we begin to identify more with Mary, we become less indulgent towards her mother.</p> <p>Likability, in literature as in life, is a fluid and unpredictable quality. Even the greatest author can\u2019t always control how a character is received. Fanny Price, the upright heroine of <em>Mansfield Park,</em> was one of Austen\u2019s favourite characters; but although Fanny has her defenders, she\u2019s never appealed to readers as much as she did to her creator. Fanny\u2019s stern rectitude is worthy and deserving \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t make her particularly sympathetic. In contrast, it\u2019s impossible to dislike Mary Crawford, the novel\u2019s bad girl. Yes, she\u2019s self-absorbed and worldly, insufficiently respectful to the clergy, and takes far too light a view of adultery. But she\u2019s also an irrepressible Austen character in her best \u201clight, bright and sparkling\u201d style. No matter that Mary has no principles, she wins our hearts nonetheless.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Other Bennet Sister by Janice Hadlow is published by Mantle.

So why choose her as the subject for a novel? On one level, I simply felt sorry for her. I\u2019d been a bookish young woman myself, with all the usual misgivings about how I appeared to the world. I would have loved to be her elder sister Elizabeth \u2013 handsome, assured and funny. But in truth, I suspected there was more than a little of Mary about me. But the same sympathy that drew me towards Mary made me reluctant to accept in its entirety Austen\u2019s version of her. The qualities that condemn her in Pride and Prejudice did not seem so heinous to me. I thought her efforts to educate herself, in the face of her family\u2019s indifference, commendable rather than ridiculous. And the earnestness that resulted from her lonely endeavours seemed rather sad and touching. The Mary I wanted to write about would look rather different from Austen\u2019s character. But could readers ever be convinced to accept her? Once a character is established as fundamentally unlikable, can anything be done to make us change our minds? I\u2019ve always believed that everything appears different if you can persuade readers to look at the world through that character\u2019s eyes. Even the most unlikely figures can be redeemed. I\u2019d seen this happen in one of the very first books I bought for myself, Rosemary Hawley Jarman\u2019s We Speak No Treason. I was swept away by Jarman\u2019s impassioned attempt to rescue Richard III from his dark status as one of the greatest villains in British history. I was thrilled by the idea that everything we thought we knew about Richard was wrong, that his character looked very different when viewed from the perspective of those who really knew him. I developed a taste for similarly provocative fictional re-evaluations, and devoured Robert Graves\u2019s I, Claudius, relishing the way in which the despised narrator is gradually revealed to be one of the cleverest and most cunning of the imperial Roman family. I returned again and again to Gore Vidal\u2019s bracingly astringent Burr, which told the story of one of the most reviled figures of the American revolution. As the man who shot Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr is now probably as famous as he\u2019s ever been, thanks to the musical Hamilton. However, he\u2019s still seen as the bad guy \u2013 or baddish, at least. This wouldn\u2019t have worried Vidal very much, for unlike Jarman, it was never his intention to present the subject of his book as a hero. Jarman\u2019s whole purpose was to clear Richard\u2019s name, to present him as a victim of history. But for both Graves and Vidal, it was the moral ambiguity of their subjects that made them interesting. Their aim was not to whitewash them into goodness, but to enter into their hearts and minds and invite us to see the world from their bleakly pragmatic perspective. First we\u2019re intrigued; then we\u2019re immersed; and soon we find ourselves identifying with a character we\u2019d previously thought irredeemable. For me, the greatest triumph of this genre is unquestionably Hilary Mantel\u2019s Wolf Hall. After reading her seductive and nuanced picture of Thomas Cromwell it is impossible ever to think of him again just as Henry VIII\u2019s cold, calculating enforcer, the man with the unsettling stare who gazes out of Holbein\u2019s famous portrait. Mantel achieves this not by denying Cromwell\u2019s dark side \u2013 he remains, in her telling, a man with a profoundly elastic moral compass \u2013 but by giving him a credible and complex inner life that, when fully appreciated, allows us to understand, if not always to condone, his actions. There is, she seems to suggest, no single Cromwell for us to pin down. Like all of us, he has a variety of guises in which he presents himself to the world. Some are ruthless, some more benign. What you think of him will very much depend on which of those faces you encounter. It\u2019s noticeable that all the central characters in these revisionist retellings are based on real people \u2013 and that all of them are men. This shouldn\u2019t really surprise us. One of the purposes of these books is to make us think again about power and those who wield it. But there\u2019s another form of fictional reimagining that has sought to sidestep these limitations by turning away from the heart of the action. It looks instead towards characters relegated to the margins and invites them into the spotlight. Many of these new protagonists are drawn not from history but from familiar works of fiction \u2013 and many of them are women. A key example, and still one of the best, is Jean Rhys\u2019s Wide Sargasso Sea. In Jane Eyre, the first Mrs Rochester, insane and hidden from view, cannot bear witness to her experiences; all we hear from her are cries and screams. But Rhys lets her speak \u2013 and having heard her story, it is impossible to think of her any longer as merely the malign impediment to Jane\u2019s happy ending. We know now who Bertha Rochester is, and our feelings about her have shifted profoundly as a result. Pat Barker\u2019s The Silence of the Girls focuses on a different kind of voicelessness. Her book is loosely based on Homer\u2019s Iliad, but is very much not a narrative of classical heroes. Instead it introduces us to the women who trudge along silently at the edge of the original, the mothers, wives and daughters who are the collateral damage of a war between men. Barker lifts them out of their anonymity, and in doing so transforms how we think of them. Alice Randall\u2019s The Wind Done Gone explores the experience of a very different kind of dispossession. Taking its inspiration from Gone With the Wind, it turns away from the white-pillared plantation house and tells its story not from the perspective of the slave owners, but from the point of view of the enslaved. Randall\u2019s characters don\u2019t exist voicelessly in the background but stand full square before us. This turns an entire fictional landscape upside down, reshaping our sympathies in the process. But if shifting perspective can make us feel more benign towards one character, it also alters how we see those around them. In Wolf Hall, the saintly Thomas More takes on a far darker quality. George Washington is a lumpish untrustworthy manipulator in Burr. In writing my own book, I too found established characters taking on a new identity. In Pride and Prejudice, Mary Bennet\u2019s mother is selfish, tactless and annoying \u2013 but her power over its heroine is limited. Elizabeth is too confident to be seriously affected by her mother\u2019s complaints. For Mary, however, who possesses none of the qualities her mother admires, Mrs Bennet is potentially a far more baleful presence, with the capacity to do real emotional damage. As we begin to identify more with Mary, we become less indulgent towards her mother. Likability, in literature as in life, is a fluid and unpredictable quality. Even the greatest author can\u2019t always control how a character is received. Fanny Price, the upright heroine of Mansfield Park, was one of Austen\u2019s favourite characters; but although Fanny has her defenders, she\u2019s never appealed to readers as much as she did to her creator. Fanny\u2019s stern rectitude is worthy and deserving \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t make her particularly sympathetic. In contrast, it\u2019s impossible to dislike Mary Crawford, the novel\u2019s bad girl. Yes, she\u2019s self-absorbed and worldly, insufficiently respectful to the clergy, and takes far too light a view of adultery. But she\u2019s also an irrepressible Austen character in her best \u201clight, bright and sparkling\u201d style. No matter that Mary has no principles, she wins our hearts nonetheless. \u2022 The Other Bennet Sister by Janice Hadlow is published by Mantle. To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

You don\u2019t tell, at least not with a crude bit of agitprop on the Liberal party website and pumped out on platforms. You show. Show up, first of all, and you show leadership by actually leading. Not by telling people you are leading. Otherwise you are not a leader. You are an internet meme. Dear Mr Morrison. You are the prime minister, not the Liberal party spruiker. We really do need you to understand that difference. Now of course governments need to tell citizens what they are doing, and perhaps the argument for doing this increases when there has been a rapid recalibration from the top like the one we\u2019ve seen over the past week or so. But Tropical Beats was not an essential communication. Not on Saturday. I doubt it was an essential communication on any day quite frankly, but certainly not on Saturday. On Saturday, people in extremis, in fire zones, needed to know where to be or where not to be. They needed to know where exactly the danger was and how to avoid it. They did not need a prime minister in their face on social platforms shouting \u201cI have not screwed this up. I am taking command of this situation. I have All The Things and I\u2019m Deploying Them.\u201d Not on a day where authorities were dealing with life and death. Not on that day.",

      "body": "<h2>Environment</h2> <p><strong>Use your voice<br></strong>The number one thing that people can do, says Libby Peake, senior policy adviser at the Green Alliance, \u201cis to press your representatives to hold politicians to account over their environmental promises\u201d. Also, onsider switching your pension and bank accounts to companies that don\u2019t invest in fossil fuels. \u201cIf done on a collective basis,\u201d Peake says, \u201cthis will send a clear message to businesses and governments that this is important to people.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Avoid anything single use</strong><br>Think beyond plastic, says Peake. \u201cIn a lot of instances, people are switching from single-use plastic to unnecessary single-use wooden cutlery, paper straws or aluminium cans,\u201d she says. \u201cBut those materials will also have an impact on the environment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81307fee42dd53b85829ec7b699bbc94e4ab3952\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81307fee42dd53b85829ec7b699bbc94e4ab3952/0_154_3043_1826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bee on lavender\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If everybody started doing insect-friendly things, it could have a real impact on insect populations.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Let bugs live</strong><br>\u201cGardens total <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/291108273\" title=\"\">5% of UK land</a>,\u201d says Peake, \u201cso if everybody started doing insect-friendly things, it could have a real impact on insect populations.\u201d Cutting out pesticide use, growing insect-friendly plants and refraining from lawn mowing are encouraged.</p> <p><strong>Shop vintage more often than not</strong><br>\u201cThe clothing industry creates more emissions than aviation and shipping combined,\u201d says Peake. \u201cIf you buy secondhand clothing, or at least invest in better-quality items, you will make a real impact on the climate crisis and pollution.\u201d No vintage stores or bountiful charity shops nearby? Shop online from <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org.uk/shop\" title=\"\">Oxfam</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rokit.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Rokit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.beyondretro.com/\" title=\"\">Beyond Retro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bragvintage.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Brag</a>, among a host of others. </p> <p><strong>Explore flight-free holiday options</strong><br>\u201cBy not flying anywhere,\u201d says Peake, \u201cyou can drastically reduce your CO2 emissions and still have a great time.\u201d She points out that <a href=\"https://nationalparks.uk/\" title=\"\">the UK has 15 stunning national parks</a>. Research rail travel to European destinations, consider Interrailing and house-swapping schemes at destinations reachable by rail or road.</p> <p><strong>Fear not the used electric car market</strong><br>If you need a car, the Green Alliance has gathered <a href=\"https://www.green-alliance.org.uk/resources/going_electric_how_everyone_can_benefit_sooner.pdf\" title=\"\">reassuring data</a> on the used electric vehicle (EV) market; because of lower running and maintenance costs, used EVs <a href=\"https://www.green-alliance.org.uk/resources/going_electric_how_everyone_can_benefit_sooner.pdf\" title=\"\">work out cheaper over five years of ownership</a>. If you own a high-emissions car like an SUV, even exchanging it for one with a conventional petrol engine, five rungs down the car-tax brackets, would cut your driving emissions by more than a third, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax-rate-tables/rates-for-cars-registered-on-or-after-1-march-2001\" title=\"\">while halving your road tax</a>. But, says Green Alliance policy director Dustin Benton, \u201cthe smarter thing to do is to buy a second- or thirdhand EV, and lower your carbon footprint by two thirds.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Buy refurbished or remanufactured electronics<br></strong>A little like refurbishing, \u201cremanufacturing is a factory-based process where electronics are returned to as-new quality, and resold with a warranty,\u201d Peake says. Look out for remanufactured goods becoming more commonplace over the coming year, and in the meantime, buy more refurbished and reconditioned electronics. Most come with decent warranties; chances are you\u2019ll get something as good as new, a lot cheaper. \u201cEvery new electronic item that makes it to market,\u201d says Peake, \u201ccreates vast amounts of waste.\u201d Smartphones, for example, contain 100g of minerals, but miners must dig through 30kg of rock to find it, <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/reports/greener-electronics-2017/#ref6\" title=\"\">according to a Greenpeace report</a>. And <a href=\"https://friendsoftheearth.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/mind-your-step-report-76803.pdf\" title=\"\">Friends of the Earth</a>, she says, \u201cestimates that each smartphone requires 12,760 litres of water (160 baths).\u201d </p> <p><strong>Plan your meals</strong><br>\u201cMinimising food waste is a good way to reduce carbon impacts,\u201d says Myles McCarthy, director of implementation at the Carbon Trust. \u201cBuy only what you will eat and home compost your food waste.\u201d If it ends up in landfill, it can produce the greenhouse gas methane. Meal planning and shopping lists are key, says Peake, and will make your life a lot easier. Look for batch-cooking ideas online to save time and energy.</p> <p><strong>Make meat a treat</strong><br>While going vegan is ideal, even reducing your meat and dairy consumption can have a big impact, McCarthy says. Beef and lamb are the biggest offenders, \u201cand most dairy products are likely to have substantially higher carbon footprints than vegetables\u201d. Analysis from the Green Alliance shows that the UK could get on track for zero carbon from land use if we <a href=\"https://www.green-alliance.org.uk/resources/Cutting_climate_impact_of_land_use.pdf\" title=\"\">ate 30% less red</a><a href=\"https://www.green-alliance.org.uk/resources/Cutting_climate_impact_of_land_use.pdf\" title=\"\"> meat by 2030</a>, combined with other measures. In his book We Are The Weather, Jonathan Safran Foer suggests cutting out meat and dairy until dinnertime, but any reduction is worthwhile, says Peake. Don\u2019t let feeling guilty for not going fully vegan stop you. </p> <p><strong>Adopt a jumper-first policy</strong><br>It\u2019s an oldie but a goodie, says Peake: \u201cPut on a jumper before you reach for the heating thermostat. Households are much warmer now than they were in the 1970s. People used to manage in colder rooms.\u201d</p> <h2>Sleep</h2> <p><strong>Go to bed on time</strong><br>Respect your circadian rhythm by going to bed and getting up at regular times, says Guy Meadows, managing partner at the Sleep School. By doing this, \u201cyou\u2019re more likely to wake up at the right time in your sleep cycle, which means you\u2019re more likely to feel refreshed\u201d. Wherever your daily sleep requirements sit in the ideal range of between seven and nine hours for adults, keeping a regular sleep-wake cycle impacts everything from \u201cappetite hormones to your heart rate and your blood pressure\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Declutter your bedroom</strong><br>\u201cYour bed is for sleep and sex only,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dr-renata-riha\" title=\"\">Renata Riha</a>, consultant in sleep and respiratory medicine at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cIt\u2019s not for watching television, knitting, reading for hours on end, or eating. Your bedroom should be a space that invites sleep.\u201d Declutter, she says, \u201cstep by step, drawer by drawer\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Switch off from work earlier</strong><br>\u201cDisengaging from work, email and your phone for at least an hour prior to bed can be helpful,\u201d says Riha, who is also <a href=\"https://www.sleepconsultancyltd.co.uk/about/renata/\" title=\"\">co-director of Sleep Consultancy Ltd</a>. Meanwhile, put some thought into activities that help you wind down. She suggests a hot shower an hour before bed, because when you get out, your body will cool to an optimal sleep temperature. Or, \u201csharing your problems, if you can, with an engaged and sympathetic listener\u201d. </p> <p><strong>Dine a little earlier</strong><br>\u201cEating acts as another marker that tells your brain it\u2019s still time to be awake,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cIt helps to leave at least a couple of hours between eating and sleeping.\u201d We\u2019re designed, he adds, to do our eating within a 12-hour window each day and then fast for the following 12. But most of us actually spread our eating over 15 hours.</p> <p><strong>Take </strong><strong>10 deep breaths<br></strong>If you\u2019re chronically stressed, you can get into a vicious cycle where stress ruins your sleep, and then tiredness exacerbates the stress. \u201cTaking 10 deep breaths can be a simple way to take you out of that fight-or-flight state,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cSocialising is another powerful way to relieve stress.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Become less dependent on sleep aids</strong><br>If you ask a normal sleeper what they do to sleep, says Meadows, \u201cthey\u2019ll say, \u2018nothing\u2019. Whereas if you ask an insomniac, they\u2019ll give you a list as long as their arm.\u201d He observes that for many, \u201cit\u2019s their extreme efforts to try and control their insomnia that push their sleep further away\u201d; sleep aids, from ear plugs or lavender pillows to Night Nurse or diazepam, erode trust in your ability to nod off naturally. Meadows says you should start by identifying these mental crutches. He uses mindfulness to help clients view their fears of sleeping without aids as \u201cjust noise in their heads\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Give your overactive mind a name</strong><br>Learn how to lean in to the brain chatter that keeps you awake, Meadows says, by giving your mind a name: \u201cIt could be the inner critic, head of drama, the Death Star.\u201d This, he says, \u201ccan transform the way you relate to your own mental events\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Dim all </strong><strong>lights an hour before bed</strong><br>\u201cLight is one of the most powerful circadian synchronisers,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cReduce the brightness on your telly, phone or iPad. It\u2019s about proximity as well. One of the problems with devices is that we hold them really close, directed straight into our eyeballs and their light-sensitive cells.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Make midday your caffeine cut</strong><strong>off<br></strong>For optimum sleep architecture, which means getting the right amounts of light, deep and REM sleep, stopping caffeine at midday is the place to start. Caffeine has a half-life of six hours, and a quarter-life of 12 hours, so even quitting at midday leaves you a quarter caffeinated beyond bedtime (unless you keep unusual hours). \u201cMany beverages and foods contain caffeine, so check the label,\u201d adds Riha. Usual suspects include chocolate, or chocolate or coffee-flavoured desserts and cereals, that bedtime mug of cocoa and some headache medications.</p> <p><strong>Take your sleep disorder seriously</strong><br>If you suspect that you or your bed partner (or any other cohabitee) has a sleep disorder, such as sleep apnoea, snoring, restless legs syndrome or insomnia, \u201cmake a doctor\u2019s appointment,\u201d says Riha.</p> <p>Bringing video evidence of a sleep disorder to a health professional is, he says, \u201cworth a thousand words and allows them to make the right diagnosis or referral\u201d.</p> <h2>Relationships</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e326411f52e4322315f1bc007b2db0cbc3a5a421\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e326411f52e4322315f1bc007b2db0cbc3a5a421/9_6_1012_607/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heart padlocks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When we\u2019ve known someone for a long time, it\u2019s easy to make assumptions about what they\u2019re thinking or feeling, or what they mean.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Check your assumptions</strong><br>When we\u2019ve known someone for a long time, it\u2019s easy to make assumptions about what they\u2019re thinking or feeling, or what they mean. <a href=\"https://www.relationshipscoach.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Relationship coach and author Sam Owen</a> suggests asking more questions instead, \u201cespecially during arguments\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Be kind<br></strong>\u201cKnow what your partner likes and use that information to be kind,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.relate.org.uk/users/ammanda-major\" title=\"\">Ammanda Major</a>, head of service quality and clinical practice at Relate. \u201cTake time to speak and listen.\u201d Being kind can simply mean showing interest, even when you\u2019re not that interested in, say, someone else\u2019s office politics (you should expect the same in return).</p> <p><strong>Give someone space</strong><br>\u201cRemember that people do need a little bit of separate space,\u201d says Major. No one has a right to expect instant responses. \u201cGive people time to reflect and don\u2019t demand instant answers.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Write thank</strong><strong> you notes</strong><br>Everyone likes to be appreciated, including work colleagues, says Joel Garfinkle, executive coach and author of Getting Ahead: Three Steps To Take Your Career To The Next Level. Thank people for their work, whether they\u2019re \u201cabove you, below you, or at peer level,\u201d he says. As well as handwritten notes, email or voicemail thank yous will strengthen bonds between you and your colleagues, says Garfinkle.</p> <p><strong>Root out one-upmanship<br></strong>Whether you are friends, colleagues or lovers, Major says, \u201cit\u2019s very easy to slip into one-upmanship over who has had the worst day. The reason is usually because we feel unheard: \u2018Why do I need to keep telling you I\u2019ve had such an awful day? Because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve responded to me in a way that lets me know you understand.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><strong>Use \u201cI\u201d statements<br></strong>If you moan to someone about their actions, Major says, \u201cyou\u2019re probably going to create a defensive situation. Whereas if you say, \u2018I felt really sad when we had that row and I would really like us to talk more about it,\u2019 nobody can argue with that: it\u2019s how you feel and you\u2019re appropriately sharing it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Level with new love interests</strong><br>\u201cBe as clear as you can about what you want from a relationship,\u201d Major says. If you\u2019ve struggled with previous relationships, she suggests, \u201csometimes it can be very helpful to get some counselling, to help you reflect on what\u2019s important to you.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Be choosy</strong><br>\u201cSocialising is linked to increases in happiness, and being around the good people in your life is energising,\u201d Owen says. But people who knock your self-esteem can have the opposite effect. She recommends pruning these draining relationships. \u201cTrust the visceral feelings that you get in your body that tell you if you feel good or bad in someone\u2019s presence.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Give a little</strong><br>\u201cGiving has been linked to increases in resilience and happiness, even if it\u2019s costly,\u201d says Owen, whose latest book is Happy Relationships: 7 Simple Rules To Create Harmony And Growth.

The result: you are more likely to eat more, but will feel less full for it.</p> <p><strong>Make smoothies</strong><br>For those who struggle to eat enough vegetables, \u201ca green smoothie that has at least two portions of veg and one of fruit is a great way to top up your intake,\u201d Parker says.</p> <p><strong>Plan your work food</strong><br>We\u2019re more likely to choose unhealthy foods outside the home. \u201cLook at your schedule at the start of the day,\u201d advises Parker, \u201cand plan meals and snacks, avoiding long gaps when you might feel excessively hungry.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Eat more protein (if you want to lose weight)</strong><br>\u201cThe longer something takes to digest, the farther down the gut it will go and the fuller it will make you feel,\u201d says Giles Yeo, principal research associate, MRC metabolic diseases unit, Cambridge University and author of Gene Eating: The Story Of Human Appetite. Any protein \u2013 whether it\u2019s from meat, beans or other plant sources \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319583.php#how-long-does-it-take-to-digest-food\" title=\"\">takes longer to digest than fats or carbs</a>, he says. Peanuts, almonds, sunflower and pumpkin seeds are good protein sources, along with soya products such as tofu and soy milk.</p> <p><strong>Stop blindly counting calories</strong><br>The energy load from ingredients varies wildly according to how they\u2019re prepared, plus we all metabolise foods differently, so counting calories isn\u2019t much use. \u201cIf you eat 100 calories worth of sweetcorn and then you look into the loo the next day, it\u2019s painfully obvious you have absorbed nowhere close to that,\u201d says Yeo. But if you eat tortillas made of dried and ground corn, he says, \u201ca far greater percentage of the calories become available\u201d. Cooking releases more calories in many foods, too, which is why, says Yeo, \u201cpeople lose weight on raw vegan diets\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Focus less on restrictions<br></strong>\u201cTry and focus on what nutrition you can add to your diet, instead of cutting out or restricting food,\u201d says Aisling Pigott, NHS and private dietitian, and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. \u201cAdd flavours with plenty of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains and protein,\u201d she says. \u201cIf your favourite meal is spaghetti bolognese, try switching to a sensible portion of brown pasta, bulking the sauce out with vegetables and mixing in different recipes (such as a lentil bolognese).\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t skip meals</strong><br>\u201cRegular meals are key to building a healthy relationship with food,\u201d says Pigott. Stabilising our eating patterns allows us to make positive food choices, whereas \u201cskipping meals, or going long periods without eating can lead to overriding our bodies\u2019 hunger and fullness cues\u201d. The trouble with being so busy that we don\u2019t stop, she says, \u201cis that it can be difficult to recognise these cues, making us more likely to overeat\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Stop and enjoy every meal</strong><br>\u201cWhether you are eating broccoli or biscuits,\u201d Pigott says, \u201ctaking time to taste and enjoy what you are eating is as nourishing as the food you are putting in your body.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Prioritise herbs and spices over salt</strong><br>Salt is not the only way to make a meal sing with flavour, and as Pigott points out, \u201cmany of us are consuming too much of it\u201d. Salt intake can increase the risk of raised blood pressure, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. </p> <p><strong>Make cooking from scratch easier</strong><br>As a protective measure against the added sugars in ready meals, Pigott recommends arming yourself with quick and easy recipes. \u201cI love <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/tin-can-cook-9781529015287.html\" title=\"\">Jack Monroe\u2019s Tin</a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/tin-can-cook-9781529015287.html\" title=\"\"> Can Cook book</a>, which has some wonderful store cupboard staples,\u201d she says. Swapping recipe ideas with friends and family, she says, \u201ccan be really motivating\u201d. Anything more than a small glass of juice (150ml) will slosh extra sugar into your diet, but \u201cwill not provide health benefits,\u201d says Pigott.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:%20weekend@theguardian.com\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Environment Use your voice The number one thing that people can do, says Libby Peake, senior policy adviser at the Green Alliance, \u201cis to press your representatives to hold politicians to account over their environmental promises\u201d. Also, onsider switching your pension and bank accounts to companies that don\u2019t invest in fossil fuels. \u201cIf done on a collective basis,\u201d Peake says, \u201cthis will send a clear message to businesses and governments that this is important to people.\u201d Avoid anything single use Think beyond plastic, says Peake. \u201cIn a lot of instances, people are switching from single-use plastic to unnecessary single-use wooden cutlery, paper straws or aluminium cans,\u201d she says. \u201cBut those materials will also have an impact on the environment.\u201d Let bugs live \u201cGardens total 5% of UK land,\u201d says Peake, \u201cso if everybody started doing insect-friendly things, it could have a real impact on insect populations.\u201d Cutting out pesticide use, growing insect-friendly plants and refraining from lawn mowing are encouraged. Shop vintage more often than not \u201cThe clothing industry creates more emissions than aviation and shipping combined,\u201d says Peake. \u201cIf you buy secondhand clothing, or at least invest in better-quality items, you will make a real impact on the climate crisis and pollution.\u201d No vintage stores or bountiful charity shops nearby? Shop online from Oxfam, Rokit, Beyond Retro and Brag, among a host of others. Explore flight-free holiday options \u201cBy not flying anywhere,\u201d says Peake, \u201cyou can drastically reduce your CO2 emissions and still have a great time.\u201d She points out that the UK has 15 stunning national parks. Research rail travel to European destinations, consider Interrailing and house-swapping schemes at destinations reachable by rail or road. Fear not the used electric car market If you need a car, the Green Alliance has gathered reassuring data on the used electric vehicle (EV) market; because of lower running and maintenance costs, used EVs work out cheaper over five years of ownership. If you own a high-emissions car like an SUV, even exchanging it for one with a conventional petrol engine, five rungs down the car-tax brackets, would cut your driving emissions by more than a third, while halving your road tax. But, says Green Alliance policy director Dustin Benton, \u201cthe smarter thing to do is to buy a second- or thirdhand EV, and lower your carbon footprint by two thirds.\u201d Buy refurbished or remanufactured electronics A little like refurbishing, \u201cremanufacturing is a factory-based process where electronics are returned to as-new quality, and resold with a warranty,\u201d Peake says. Look out for remanufactured goods becoming more commonplace over the coming year, and in the meantime, buy more refurbished and reconditioned electronics. Most come with decent warranties; chances are you\u2019ll get something as good as new, a lot cheaper. \u201cEvery new electronic item that makes it to market,\u201d says Peake, \u201ccreates vast amounts of waste.\u201d Smartphones, for example, contain 100g of minerals, but miners must dig through 30kg of rock to find it, according to a Greenpeace report. And Friends of the Earth, she says, \u201cestimates that each smartphone requires 12,760 litres of water (160 baths).\u201d Plan your meals \u201cMinimising food waste is a good way to reduce carbon impacts,\u201d says Myles McCarthy, director of implementation at the Carbon Trust. \u201cBuy only what you will eat and home compost your food waste.\u201d If it ends up in landfill, it can produce the greenhouse gas methane. Meal planning and shopping lists are key, says Peake, and will make your life a lot easier. Look for batch-cooking ideas online to save time and energy. Make meat a treat While going vegan is ideal, even reducing your meat and dairy consumption can have a big impact, McCarthy says. Beef and lamb are the biggest offenders, \u201cand most dairy products are likely to have substantially higher carbon footprints than vegetables\u201d. Analysis from the Green Alliance shows that the UK could get on track for zero carbon from land use if we ate 30% less red meat by 2030, combined with other measures. In his book We Are The Weather, Jonathan Safran Foer suggests cutting out meat and dairy until dinnertime, but any reduction is worthwhile, says Peake. Don\u2019t let feeling guilty for not going fully vegan stop you. Adopt a jumper-first policy It\u2019s an oldie but a goodie, says Peake: \u201cPut on a jumper before you reach for the heating thermostat. Households are much warmer now than they were in the 1970s. People used to manage in colder rooms.\u201d Sleep Go to bed on time Respect your circadian rhythm by going to bed and getting up at regular times, says Guy Meadows, managing partner at the Sleep School. By doing this, \u201cyou\u2019re more likely to wake up at the right time in your sleep cycle, which means you\u2019re more likely to feel refreshed\u201d. Wherever your daily sleep requirements sit in the ideal range of between seven and nine hours for adults, keeping a regular sleep-wake cycle impacts everything from \u201cappetite hormones to your heart rate and your blood pressure\u201d. Declutter your bedroom \u201cYour bed is for sleep and sex only,\u201d says Renata Riha, consultant in sleep and respiratory medicine at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cIt\u2019s not for watching television, knitting, reading for hours on end, or eating. Your bedroom should be a space that invites sleep.\u201d Declutter, she says, \u201cstep by step, drawer by drawer\u201d. Switch off from work earlier \u201cDisengaging from work, email and your phone for at least an hour prior to bed can be helpful,\u201d says Riha, who is also co-director of Sleep Consultancy Ltd. Meanwhile, put some thought into activities that help you wind down. She suggests a hot shower an hour before bed, because when you get out, your body will cool to an optimal sleep temperature. Or, \u201csharing your problems, if you can, with an engaged and sympathetic listener\u201d. Dine a little earlier \u201cEating acts as another marker that tells your brain it\u2019s still time to be awake,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cIt helps to leave at least a couple of hours between eating and sleeping.\u201d We\u2019re designed, he adds, to do our eating within a 12-hour window each day and then fast for the following 12. But most of us actually spread our eating over 15 hours. Take 10 deep breaths If you\u2019re chronically stressed, you can get into a vicious cycle where stress ruins your sleep, and then tiredness exacerbates the stress. \u201cTaking 10 deep breaths can be a simple way to take you out of that fight-or-flight state,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cSocialising is another powerful way to relieve stress.\u201d Become less dependent on sleep aids If you ask a normal sleeper what they do to sleep, says Meadows, \u201cthey\u2019ll say, \u2018nothing\u2019. Whereas if you ask an insomniac, they\u2019ll give you a list as long as their arm.\u201d He observes that for many, \u201cit\u2019s their extreme efforts to try and control their insomnia that push their sleep further away\u201d; sleep aids, from ear plugs or lavender pillows to Night Nurse or diazepam, erode trust in your ability to nod off naturally. Meadows says you should start by identifying these mental crutches. He uses mindfulness to help clients view their fears of sleeping without aids as \u201cjust noise in their heads\u201d. Give your overactive mind a name Learn how to lean in to the brain chatter that keeps you awake, Meadows says, by giving your mind a name: \u201cIt could be the inner critic, head of drama, the Death Star.\u201d This, he says, \u201ccan transform the way you relate to your own mental events\u201d. Dim all lights an hour before bed \u201cLight is one of the most powerful circadian synchronisers,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cReduce the brightness on your telly, phone or iPad. It\u2019s about proximity as well. One of the problems with devices is that we hold them really close, directed straight into our eyeballs and their light-sensitive cells.\u201d Make midday your caffeine cutoff For optimum sleep architecture, which means getting the right amounts of light, deep and REM sleep, stopping caffeine at midday is the place to start. Caffeine has a half-life of six hours, and a quarter-life of 12 hours, so even quitting at midday leaves you a quarter caffeinated beyond bedtime (unless you keep unusual hours). \u201cMany beverages and foods contain caffeine, so check the label,\u201d adds Riha. Usual suspects include chocolate, or chocolate or coffee-flavoured desserts and cereals, that bedtime mug of cocoa and some headache medications. Take your sleep disorder seriously If you suspect that you or your bed partner (or any other cohabitee) has a sleep disorder, such as sleep apnoea, snoring, restless legs syndrome or insomnia, \u201cmake a doctor\u2019s appointment,\u201d says Riha. Bringing video evidence of a sleep disorder to a health professional is, he says, \u201cworth a thousand words and allows them to make the right diagnosis or referral\u201d. Relationships Check your assumptions When we\u2019ve known someone for a long time, it\u2019s easy to make assumptions about what they\u2019re thinking or feeling, or what they mean. Relationship coach and author Sam Owen suggests asking more questions instead, \u201cespecially during arguments\u201d. Be kind \u201cKnow what your partner likes and use that information to be kind,\u201d says Ammanda Major, head of service quality and clinical practice at Relate. \u201cTake time to speak and listen.\u201d Being kind can simply mean showing interest, even when you\u2019re not that interested in, say, someone else\u2019s office politics (you should expect the same in return). Give someone space \u201cRemember that people do need a little bit of separate space,\u201d says Major. No one has a right to expect instant responses. \u201cGive people time to reflect and don\u2019t demand instant answers.\u201d Write thank you notes Everyone likes to be appreciated, including work colleagues, says Joel Garfinkle, executive coach and author of Getting Ahead: Three Steps To Take Your Career To The Next Level. Thank people for their work, whether they\u2019re \u201cabove you, below you, or at peer level,\u201d he says. As well as handwritten notes, email or voicemail thank yous will strengthen bonds between you and your colleagues, says Garfinkle. Root out one-upmanship Whether you are friends, colleagues or lovers, Major says, \u201cit\u2019s very easy to slip into one-upmanship over who has had the worst day. The reason is usually because we feel unheard: \u2018Why do I need to keep telling you I\u2019ve had such an awful day? Because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve responded to me in a way that lets me know you understand.\u2019\u201d Use \u201cI\u201d statements If you moan to someone about their actions, Major says, \u201cyou\u2019re probably going to create a defensive situation. Whereas if you say, \u2018I felt really sad when we had that row and I would really like us to talk more about it,\u2019 nobody can argue with that: it\u2019s how you feel and you\u2019re appropriately sharing it.\u201d Level with new love interests \u201cBe as clear as you can about what you want from a relationship,\u201d Major says. If you\u2019ve struggled with previous relationships, she suggests, \u201csometimes it can be very helpful to get some counselling, to help you reflect on what\u2019s important to you.\u201d Be choosy \u201cSocialising is linked to increases in happiness, and being around the good people in your life is energising,\u201d Owen says. But people who knock your self-esteem can have the opposite effect. She recommends pruning these draining relationships. \u201cTrust the visceral feelings that you get in your body that tell you if you feel good or bad in someone\u2019s presence.\u201d Give a little \u201cGiving has been linked to increases in resilience and happiness, even if it\u2019s costly,\u201d says Owen, whose latest book is Happy Relationships: 7 Simple Rules To Create Harmony And Growth. Giving can mean many things, from \u201cgiving your time to an elderly neighbour, or helping your parents more, or giving something to somebody who is homeless\u201d. Try biting your tongue This is not to suppress expressing your feelings, but rather, learning to become more reflective than reactive. If something bothers you, Owen says, \u201cwatch it over time. Do something that regulates your emotions. Go for a walk (which can help problem solve), listen to some music.\u201d This gives you time to consider how to frame the issue in more productive language. Exercise Monitor yourself Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London, says that \u201cbeing your own scientist and collecting data,\u201d through regular weighing or wearing a fitness monitor, is a proven route to success. \u201cIf you don\u2019t collect data about yourself, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re going to notice what works for you.\u201d Use visual prompts If you want to start a fitness habit, it\u2019s important to leave visual nudges for yourself. \u201cEven something small like putting your running trainers by the door,\u201d suggests Emma Norris, research fellow for the Human Behaviour Change Project at University College London. Make \u201cif then\u201d plans \u201cIf I\u2019m going to work, then I\u2019ll pack some fruit in my bag.\u201d Or, \u201cIf it rains on a running day, then I\u2019ll do a YouTube workout instead.\u201d Plans like this, says Norris, \u201creduce the option for you to opt out, by programming yourself to think that this is what you would always do in that situation\u201d. Temper your goals As tempting as it may be to try to do everything at once, setting attainable goals is key, says Margie Lachman, professor of psychology at Brandeis University in Massachusetts. \u201cIt is hard to make a big change all at once. Small increments are helpful.\u201d If you get a pedometer, for example, Norris recommends upping your existing step count by 10% each week. Give up less easily \u201cThere\u2019s some evidence that the time taken to form a habit ranges from 18 days to 254 days, depending on the person and the behaviour,\u201d says Norris. So if it doesn\u2019t stick quickly, be persistent and use the strategies listed here to help you. Reward yourself \u201cWhen you reach those little milestones,\u201d Norris says, \u201cthink creatively about what a healthy reward would be for you: seeing a friend, reading a book you\u2019ve been meaning to read, or whatever works for you that isn\u2019t the obvious cake.\u201d Try a free workout The NHS website has a virtual fitness studio, says Norris, \u201cwith a range of free workouts ranging from 10-45 minutes, across aerobics, strength training, pilates, dance and more\u201d. YouTube, she says, \u201cis chock-a-block with free programmes and videos: Joe Wicks\u2019s The Body Coach is my personal go-to for 15-20 high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts.\u201d She recommends trying a variety. Sneak activity into everyday life \u201cIf you are busy and live by your calendar,\u201d Lachman says, \u201cput times in the schedule when you can be active. Take extra steps rather than shortcuts; walk the stairs instead of getting the lift, park further away from the destination, take a walk during a one-on-one meeting.\u201d Make exercise social \u201cAccountability helps,\u201d Lachman says, \u201cso let others know you are trying to be more active. Share your accomplishments on social media. Find an activity partner or walking group.\u201d Stand up every 30 minutes \u201cSo many of us are chained to our desks every day,\u201d says nutrition and fitness author Louise Parker. \u201cIf you make getting up every 30 minutes or so a habit, not only will it keep you moving, but it can help give your brain a refresh.\u201d Diet Separate mealtimes from screen time \u201cIf you\u2019re watching TV, scrolling through Instagram or checking your emails, you\u2019re not paying much attention to what you\u2019re eating,\u201d Parker says. The result: you are more likely to eat more, but will feel less full for it. Make smoothies For those who struggle to eat enough vegetables, \u201ca green smoothie that has at least two portions of veg and one of fruit is a great way to top up your intake,\u201d Parker says. Plan your work food We\u2019re more likely to choose unhealthy foods outside the home. \u201cLook at your schedule at the start of the day,\u201d advises Parker, \u201cand plan meals and snacks, avoiding long gaps when you might feel excessively hungry.\u201d Eat more protein (if you want to lose weight) \u201cThe longer something takes to digest, the farther down the gut it will go and the fuller it will make you feel,\u201d says Giles Yeo, principal research associate, MRC metabolic diseases unit, Cambridge University and author of Gene Eating: The Story Of Human Appetite. Any protein \u2013 whether it\u2019s from meat, beans or other plant sources \u2013 takes longer to digest than fats or carbs, he says. Peanuts, almonds, sunflower and pumpkin seeds are good protein sources, along with soya products such as tofu and soy milk. Stop blindly counting calories The energy load from ingredients varies wildly according to how they\u2019re prepared, plus we all metabolise foods differently, so counting calories isn\u2019t much use. \u201cIf you eat 100 calories worth of sweetcorn and then you look into the loo the next day, it\u2019s painfully obvious you have absorbed nowhere close to that,\u201d says Yeo. But if you eat tortillas made of dried and ground corn, he says, \u201ca far greater percentage of the calories become available\u201d. Cooking releases more calories in many foods, too, which is why, says Yeo, \u201cpeople lose weight on raw vegan diets\u201d. Focus less on restrictions \u201cTry and focus on what nutrition you can add to your diet, instead of cutting out or restricting food,\u201d says Aisling Pigott, NHS and private dietitian, and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. \u201cAdd flavours with plenty of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains and protein,\u201d she says. \u201cIf your favourite meal is spaghetti bolognese, try switching to a sensible portion of brown pasta, bulking the sauce out with vegetables and mixing in different recipes (such as a lentil bolognese).\u201d Don\u2019t skip meals \u201cRegular meals are key to building a healthy relationship with food,\u201d says Pigott. Stabilising our eating patterns allows us to make positive food choices, whereas \u201cskipping meals, or going long periods without eating can lead to overriding our bodies\u2019 hunger and fullness cues\u201d. The trouble with being so busy that we don\u2019t stop, she says, \u201cis that it can be difficult to recognise these cues, making us more likely to overeat\u201d. Stop and enjoy every meal \u201cWhether you are eating broccoli or biscuits,\u201d Pigott says, \u201ctaking time to taste and enjoy what you are eating is as nourishing as the food you are putting in your body.\u201d Prioritise herbs and spices over salt Salt is not the only way to make a meal sing with flavour, and as Pigott points out, \u201cmany of us are consuming too much of it\u201d. Salt intake can increase the risk of raised blood pressure, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Make cooking from scratch easier As a protective measure against the added sugars in ready meals, Pigott recommends arming yourself with quick and easy recipes. \u201cI love Jack Monroe\u2019s Tin Can Cook book, which has some wonderful store cupboard staples,\u201d she says. Swapping recipe ideas with friends and family, she says, \u201ccan be really motivating\u201d. Anything more than a small glass of juice (150ml) will slosh extra sugar into your diet, but \u201cwill not provide health benefits,\u201d says Pigott. \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>From the personal boundary-decimating blancmange that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jun/01/noel-edmonds-bank-mr-blobby-barmy-reputation\">Mr Blobby</a> to a satin-clad <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ann-widdecombe\">Ann Widdecombe</a> being dragged across the dancefloor to the strains of Wild Thing, Saturday night TV has long been built on inanity, ridiculousness and highly disconcerting fever dream sequences. But this month the schedules are destined to become that little bit more hallucinatory thanks to The Masked Singer, a show that makes that time Dale Winton forced celebrities to hurl themselves through holes in a giant foam wall seem like an entirely rational and restrained way to entertain a nation.</p> <p>A fur-coated Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a format, The Masked Singer takes a cast of celebrities and conceals their identity behind elaborate and frequently terrifying animal costumes. These disguised celebs then have to sing before a panel of (also) celebrity detectives, who are tasked with divining the star behind the disguise. In each episode, via a complex judging process, one contestant is unmasked to squeals of frenzied excitement. Essentially, Saturday night TV is about to be filled with the sight of a giant rubber duck performing Like a Virgin in a conical bra, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/jonathan-ross\">Jonathan Ross</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/30/davina-mccall-this-much-know\">Davina McCall</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rita-ora\">Rita Ora</a> and The Hangover star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/12/ken-jeong-nude-scenes-the-hangover-standup-adelphi-theatre-london\">Ken Jeong</a> make wild, baseless guesses about the bird\u2019s true identity. And if versions of the show that have already aired in Thailand, Mexico, France or the US \u2013 where it was the highest-rated show on network TV last year \u2013 are anything to go by, it is likely to be a smash.</p> <p>The UK is actually relatively late to the nightmare-inducing shindig that is The Masked Singer. In a pleasing inversion of the traditional west-to-east TV-globalisation narrative, the show started life as a South Korean format; now 22 countries have their own versions. Why has this patently bonkers concept taken off in such a big way?</p> <p>For Jeong, who is also a panellist on the US version, The Masked Singer\u2019s appeal lies in its detachment from reality. \u201cIt\u2019s pure escapism,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a world where the political landscape is very intense globally, it\u2019s a palate cleanser. There is nothing partisan or political about this show.\u201d By the same token, you could view its WTF-ery as a reflection of surreal times: gobsmacking political developments and outrageous opinions now form society\u2019s bassline hum \u2013 perhaps we need something even stranger to cut through the noise.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWbPeTmZHJ4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kWbPeTmZHJ4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>What\u2019s certain is that The Masked Singer is a traditional shiny floor show machine-tooled for the modern world. It is designed \u201cto appeal to an Instagram generation\u201d, says executive producer Derek McLean. \u201cWhen you see the costumes, they really pop.\u201d The meme-generating visuals are accompanied by a Twitter-friendly interactive element, with users posting their guesses online in real time and thereby spreading the word. \u201cSuddenly people looking on social media are going: \u2018What are they talking about?\u2019\u201d says McLean. \u201cAnd then they go [and watch] the show.\u201d</p> <p>The long-term sustainability of all this internet chatter is dependent on one factor: genuinely good celebs.

      "bodyText": "From the personal boundary-decimating blancmange that was Mr Blobby to a satin-clad Ann Widdecombe being dragged across the dancefloor to the strains of Wild Thing, Saturday night TV has long been built on inanity, ridiculousness and highly disconcerting fever dream sequences. But this month the schedules are destined to become that little bit more hallucinatory thanks to The Masked Singer, a show that makes that time Dale Winton forced celebrities to hurl themselves through holes in a giant foam wall seem like an entirely rational and restrained way to entertain a nation. A fur-coated Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a format, The Masked Singer takes a cast of celebrities and conceals their identity behind elaborate and frequently terrifying animal costumes. These disguised celebs then have to sing before a panel of (also) celebrity detectives, who are tasked with divining the star behind the disguise. In each episode, via a complex judging process, one contestant is unmasked to squeals of frenzied excitement. Essentially, Saturday night TV is about to be filled with the sight of a giant rubber duck performing Like a Virgin in a conical bra, as Jonathan Ross, Davina McCall, Rita Ora and The Hangover star Ken Jeong make wild, baseless guesses about the bird\u2019s true identity. And if versions of the show that have already aired in Thailand, Mexico, France or the US \u2013 where it was the highest-rated show on network TV last year \u2013 are anything to go by, it is likely to be a smash. The UK is actually relatively late to the nightmare-inducing shindig that is The Masked Singer. In a pleasing inversion of the traditional west-to-east TV-globalisation narrative, the show started life as a South Korean format; now 22 countries have their own versions. Why has this patently bonkers concept taken off in such a big way? For Jeong, who is also a panellist on the US version, The Masked Singer\u2019s appeal lies in its detachment from reality. \u201cIt\u2019s pure escapism,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a world where the political landscape is very intense globally, it\u2019s a palate cleanser. There is nothing partisan or political about this show.\u201d By the same token, you could view its WTF-ery as a reflection of surreal times: gobsmacking political developments and outrageous opinions now form society\u2019s bassline hum \u2013 perhaps we need something even stranger to cut through the noise. What\u2019s certain is that The Masked Singer is a traditional shiny floor show machine-tooled for the modern world. It is designed \u201cto appeal to an Instagram generation\u201d, says executive producer Derek McLean. \u201cWhen you see the costumes, they really pop.\u201d The meme-generating visuals are accompanied by a Twitter-friendly interactive element, with users posting their guesses online in real time and thereby spreading the word. \u201cSuddenly people looking on social media are going: \u2018What are they talking about?\u2019\u201d says McLean. \u201cAnd then they go [and watch] the show.\u201d The long-term sustainability of all this internet chatter is dependent on one factor: genuinely good celebs. Unlike the obscurities that bulk up the Strictly and I\u2019m a Celebrity lineups, each star has to be recognisable in order to secure that big reveal high \u2013 the US version has attracted the likes of Seal and Gladys Knight, while the Korean show even featured Ryan Reynolds (performing Tomorrow from Annie from behind a cardboard unicorn mask). This relatively high-quality guestlist has a knock-on effect on the show\u2019s tone. \u201cWith celebrity comes a lot of fragile ego, so in the US version we were taught not to be too savage,\u201d Jeong explains. \u201cThey\u2019re all millionaire celebrities \u2013 they may not come back the next week if I\u2019m too critical!\u201d The show doesn\u2019t just ditch the eviscerating critique of baddies such as Simon Cowell and Craig Revel Horwood; the chronically flummoxed panellists don\u2019t really offer any feedback at all. The glossy TV talent show, it would seem, has also had quite enough of experts. What The Masked Singer can\u2019t get enough of, however, is celeb reverence.

The report also criticises the Morrison government for being a \u201cregressive force\u201d internationally. 12 December 2019 Morrison attempts to reassure voters that he understands bushfires are a natural emergency and that he accepts the link between climate change and an extended fire season, while dismissing international censure of his government\u2019s climate policies as \u201cnot credible\u201d. 16 December 2019 Reports circulate that the prime minister has gone on holidays to Hawaii, as Sydney battles extreme smoke pollution as out-of-control bushfires burn through the Blue Mountains. The prime minister\u2019s office says his whereabouts are \u201cnot a story\u201d and that claims he is on holiday in Hawaii are \u201cwrong\u201d. 17 December 2019 Littleproud says he met with Mullins and told the delegation they \u201cshould take great comfort and great pride in the current cohort of fire chiefs around the country who have planned meticulously for these fires\u201d. Littleproud says fighting bushfires is \u201cobviously \u2026 the responsibility of states but the federal government kicks the tin. We don\u2019t walk away from this.\u201d 17 December 2019 The Emergency Leaders for Climate Action say they will hold a summit after the current bushfire season because of their \u201chuge disappointment in the lack of national leadership during a bushfire crisis\u201d. It comes as fires raged across New South Wales and Western Australia on Monday and as Australia was named as one of a handful of countries responsible for thwarting a global deal on the rulebook of the Paris climate agreement. 19 December 2019 Two volunteer firefighters, Geoffrey Keaton, 32, and Andrew O\u2019Dwyer, 36, die fighting fires south-west of Sydney when a tree hits their tanker. 20 December 2019 Morrison says he will return from holidays. \u201cI deeply regret any offence caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with family at this time,\u201d he says in a statement. \u201cGiven the most recent tragic events, I will be returning to Sydney as soon as can be arranged.\u201d 22 December 2019 Morrison returns to work and signals the Australian government will not increase its efforts to combat climate change despite the bushfire crisis and record-breaking heatwave. He says drawing attention to climate crisis and emissions reduction policies during the bushfire season is an attempt to \u201cscore [political] points\u201d during a disaster. He says the government is considering calls to pay volunteer firefighters but notes that is \u201cin the first instance\u201d a matter for state governments. 23 December 2019 Morrison says calls to reduce carbon emissions are \u201creckless\u201d and that Australia doesn\u2019t need to do more on tackling climate crisis. He rejects calls from the opposition to bring forward a meeting with state governments to address the bushfire crisis. 29 December 2019 Morrison agrees to compensation payments made to NSW volunteer firefighters who have lost income due to fighting bushfires, but he sees no further role for the commonwealth. \u201cWe\u2019re there to help the states and territories as they address these crises. The states are the ones, as premier knows all too well, who are directly responsible for the funding of their fire services and all the other things that are done.\u201d 30 December 2019 A third NSW RFS volunteer, Samuel McPaul, is killed when his truck rolls during extreme conditions at a fire near Jingellic, on the NSW/Victoria border. 31 December 2019 Morrison releases a statement through social media offering condolences to McPaul\u2019s relatives and emphasising the leading role of the state and territory firefighting authorities in the bushfire crisis. He says the commonwealth will continue in its role of providing \u201csupport\u201d to those efforts. 1 January 2020 Morrison shares his new year message urging Australians to celebrate living \u201cin the most amazing country on earth\u201d and remember \u201cthere\u2019s no better place to raise kids anywhere on the planet\u201d. He does not make any connection between the bushfires and global heating, suggesting that Australians had faced similarly terrible ordeals throughout history. Later that day, Morrison hosts the annual New Year\u2019s Day Cricket Australia-McGrath Foundation reception with the Australian and New Zealand teams at Kirribilli in Sydney. In his address to the teams, he says forthcoming Sydney Test match will be \u201cplayed out against terrible events\u201d but that \u201cat the same time Australians will be gathered whether it\u2019s at the SCG or around television sets all around the country and they\u2019ll be inspired by the great feats of our cricketers from both sides of the Tasman and I think they\u2019ll be encouraged by the spirit shown by Australians\u201d. 2 January 2020 At a press conference, Morrison says he\u2019s \u201calways acknowledged the link \u2026 between the broader issues of global climate change and what that means for the world\u2019s weather and the dryness of conditions in many places\u201d but that \u201cno response by any one government anywhere in the world can be linked to any one fire event\u201d. Morrison reiterates he has no plans to change Australia\u2019s emissions reduction policy. He defends his government\u2019s response to the fires by saying he doesn\u2019t want state and federal governments \u201cto be tripping over each other in order to somehow outbid each other in the response\u201d. Navy ships and army aircraft are dispatched to help fight bushfires in Victoria. 3 January 2020 While initially saying it was \u201cstill the plan\u201d to go to India later in January for trade and defence talks, at which Australia\u2019s coal exports were expected to feature heavily, Morrison says only hours later that he is \u201cinclined not to proceed\u201d with the visit, which has now been postponed. 4 January 2020 The army reserve is called in to assist with firefighting efforts. Morrison says the federal government will agree to a request made 18 months ago to permanently increase funding to Australia\u2019s aerial firefighting capacity. The prime minister\u2019s office releases an ad spruiking its firefighting efforts, backed by a jaunty jingle.",

But the big problem now is that Philadelphia is so banged up that just winning its last four games and the championship in the mediocre NFC East is being regarded as a significant accomplishment. How will, or can, they possibly win a playoff game against Seattle on Sunday?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/03/nfl-wild-card-predictions-patriots-saints-eagles-seahawks\">NFL wildcard weekend picks: Saints to march on, Bills to upset Texans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because of the NFL\u2019s awkward playoff format, the Eagles (9-7) will play host to the Seahawks (11-5) because the Eagles won their division and Seattle is merely a wild-card team, albeit in a better division. Lincoln Financial Field in south Philadelphia is such a snake pit that Seattle is only a slight favorite. But Wentz also might be playing his most inspiring football ever.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s grown up as a leader of this team,\u201d says Doug Pederson, the Philadelphia coach and former NFL quarterback. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it here now the last couple of games, how he\u2019s really just put the team on his back and said, \u2018Hey, follow me,\u2019 and I think that\u2019s a sign of growth and a sign of maturity.\u201d</p> <p>But Pederson adds this: \u201cI spent eight years in Green Bay with Brett Favre, and that\u2019s what Brett did. Brett just put the team on his back when the chips were against us and he said, \u2018Hey, follow me,\u2019 and that\u2019s what Carson can do.\u201d</p> <p>Whoa. Pederson favorably compares Wentz with Brett Favre, the gritty legend who threw for 71,838 yards and 508 touchdowns. Wentz, who turned 27 this week, has thrown for only 14,191 yards and 97 touchdowns after the Eagles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/apr/28/nfl-draft-first-round-carson-wentz-jared-goff\">used their first-round draft choice on him in 2016</a>, and his last two seasons ended early because of knee and back injuries.</p> <p>But Wentz is healthy now, and grateful: \u201cGrateful for my health, grateful to be out here with the guys in these big meaningful games. Grateful to be playing into January,\u201d he said. The Eagles were 5-7 after losing their third straight game on 23 November to the lowly Dolphins, but Wentz has helped a patchwork unit that now includes former practice-squad players eke into the postseason.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/nfl/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;headline=2018%20statistics&amp;name=Carson%20Wentz&amp;team=Philadelphia%20Eagles&amp;position=Quarterback&amp;number=11&amp;touchdowns=27&amp;interceptions=7&amp;yards=4,039&amp;rating=93.1\" data-alt=\"Carson Wentz\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/nfl/index.html?opinion-tint=false&headline=2018%20statistics&name=Carson%20Wentz&team=Philadelphia%20Eagles&position=Quarterback&number=11&touchdowns=27&interceptions=7&yards=4,039&rating=93.1\">Carson Wentz</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cEven when there have been a few drives where they are punting the ball, he is not frustrated, he\u2019s patient, he\u2019s making good decisions,\u201d says Malcolm Jenkins, the Eagles\u2019 veteran safety, \u201cand I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve needed in these games.

      "bodyText": "Not many people expect the Philadelphia Eagles to last very long in the NFL playoffs this year, but not many people expected them to win the Super Bowl two years ago, either. The Eagles somehow won two home playoff games as an underdog then and upset the New England Patriots with their backup quarterback, Nick Foles, to win their first Vince Lombardi Trophy. Well, Foles is gone, and the first-choice starter in 2017, Carson Wentz, is healthy, back in his place and playing better than ever. But the big problem now is that Philadelphia is so banged up that just winning its last four games and the championship in the mediocre NFC East is being regarded as a significant accomplishment. How will, or can, they possibly win a playoff game against Seattle on Sunday? Because of the NFL\u2019s awkward playoff format, the Eagles (9-7) will play host to the Seahawks (11-5) because the Eagles won their division and Seattle is merely a wild-card team, albeit in a better division. Lincoln Financial Field in south Philadelphia is such a snake pit that Seattle is only a slight favorite. But Wentz also might be playing his most inspiring football ever. \u201cI think he\u2019s grown up as a leader of this team,\u201d says Doug Pederson, the Philadelphia coach and former NFL quarterback. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it here now the last couple of games, how he\u2019s really just put the team on his back and said, \u2018Hey, follow me,\u2019 and I think that\u2019s a sign of growth and a sign of maturity.\u201d But Pederson adds this: \u201cI spent eight years in Green Bay with Brett Favre, and that\u2019s what Brett did. Brett just put the team on his back when the chips were against us and he said, \u2018Hey, follow me,\u2019 and that\u2019s what Carson can do.\u201d Whoa. Pederson favorably compares Wentz with Brett Favre, the gritty legend who threw for 71,838 yards and 508 touchdowns. Wentz, who turned 27 this week, has thrown for only 14,191 yards and 97 touchdowns after the Eagles used their first-round draft choice on him in 2016, and his last two seasons ended early because of knee and back injuries. But Wentz is healthy now, and grateful: \u201cGrateful for my health, grateful to be out here with the guys in these big meaningful games. Grateful to be playing into January,\u201d he said. The Eagles were 5-7 after losing their third straight game on 23 November to the lowly Dolphins, but Wentz has helped a patchwork unit that now includes former practice-squad players eke into the postseason. \u201cEven when there have been a few drives where they are punting the ball, he is not frustrated, he\u2019s patient, he\u2019s making good decisions,\u201d says Malcolm Jenkins, the Eagles\u2019 veteran safety, \u201cand I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve needed in these games. Nobody has been playing better than he has.\u201d Wentz used the word \u201cgrateful\u201d no fewer than 10 times in a news conference after Sunday\u2019s victory at the Meadowlands, where the Eagles have won 11 of their last 13 meetings with the Giants. He was wearing a black cap with a Philadelphia logo and champions stitched on the front, as well as a green T-shirt under his suit jacket with, \u201cThe East Is Not Enough\u201d.

We\u2019re not done.\u201d Wentz is seemingly bigger than his listed measurements of 6ft 5in and 237lbs.

The wine element may sound weird, but it adds a gorgeous, berry fruitiness to the drink.</p> <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br>Serves<strong> 2</strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp cocoa powder </strong><br><strong>\u00bc tsp ground cinnamon</strong><br><strong>200ml whole milk </strong><br><strong>75ml alcohol-free red wine</strong>,<strong> </strong>or elderberry juice<strong> </strong><br><strong>1\u20132 squares dark chocolate</strong>, plus a little extra, grated, to garnish<br><strong>Squirty cream and/or marshmallows</strong>, to garnish</p> <p>Put the cocoa powder and cinnamon in a small bowl. Heat the milk in a small saucepan over a medium heat until just below boiling, then pour enough hot milk over the cocoa mix just to make a smooth, runny paste.</p> <p>Pour the paste into the saucepan of milk, add the \u2018wine\u2019, and heat again to just below simmering point. Take off the heat, add the chocolate and stir until melted.</p> <p>Pour into two small mugs or heatproof glasses, and top each with a generous squirt of cream and/or a couple of marshmallows. Finish with a grating of dark chocolate.</p> <h2><strong>Cranberry cordial</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82f764d647b68e2108269ad61d088db2e018882b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82f764d647b68e2108269ad61d088db2e018882b/0_0_3543_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cranberry cordial from scratch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cranberry cordial from scratch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ola O Smit/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can, of course, buy cranberry juice everywhere, but this cordial has a much more intense flavour and a vivid, scarlet colour. Save the strained fruit and use it as a topping for muesli, stir it into porridge or add it to a fruit loaf or teabread.</p> <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br>Cool <strong>24-48 hr</strong><br>Makes <strong>About 600ml</strong></p> <p><strong>250g granulated sugar </strong><br><strong>400ml water</strong><br><strong>200g fresh cranberries</strong>, rinsed<br><strong>2 finely pared strips of unwaxed orange or clementine rind</strong><br><strong>1 cinnamon stick </strong><br><strong>30ml freshly squeezed orange or clementine juice</strong>, strained <br><strong>Soda or sparkling water</strong>, to serve</p> <p>Put the sugar in a saucepan and add the water. Heat over a low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil, then add the cranberries, orange or clementine rind, and the cinnamon, and simmer for five minutes, until the skins of the cranberries have split but the berries are still holding their shape. Take off the heat, add the orange or clementine juice, and leave to cool.</p> <p>Strain through a fine sieve into a wide-necked jug or bowl, then pour through a funnel into a sterilised bottle or other clean airtight container. Seal and refrigerate for 24\u201348 hours before using; it will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks.</p> <p>To serve, dilute 4:1 or 5:1 with soda or sparkling water.</p> <h2><strong>Turmeric latte</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efb7c9e8dafbec092983338aad59fc0af4ed8466\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efb7c9e8dafbec092983338aad59fc0af4ed8466/0_0_3543_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turmeric latte.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turmeric latte.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ola O Smit/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also known as golden mylk, turmeric latte has been one of the iconic vegan drinks of the past few years, but it\u2019s actually quite simple to make at home. The whisking may sound like a bit of a performance, but it\u2019s actually key to the drink, because it integrates the spices fully and gives it that luxuriant, foamy texture. You may find you need slightly more turmeric, depending on the strength and freshness of the one you have, while the pepper helps to activate its health-giving properties.</p> <p>Prep<strong> 10 min</strong><br>Makes <strong>1 mug or 2 smaller cups</strong></p> <p><strong>225ml coconut, almond or oat milk </strong>\u2013 I like <a href=\"https://rebel-kitchen.com/\" title=\"\">Rebel Kitchen Mylk</a>, which contains coconut cream, brown rice and cashew<br><strong>\u00bd tsp ground turmeric </strong><br><strong>\u00bc tsp ground cinnamon</strong><br><strong>\u215b tsp ground ginger </strong><br><strong>\u215b tsp finely ground black pepper</strong><br><strong>1 tsp agave or maple syrup</strong>, or honey if you\u2019re not vegan</p> <p>Pour the milk into a saucepan and add all the remaining ingredients. Heat over a moderate heat, whisking all the time with a small balloon whisk or milk frother, until it\u2019s nice and frothy, then pour into a mug or two smaller cups; if you want a smoother texture, pour the mixture through a fine strainer.</p> <h2><strong>Switchel</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4e12272df8041a4bece8b0c551178af58a6ccf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4e12272df8041a4bece8b0c551178af58a6ccf7/0_0_3543_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A haymaker\u2019s punch, or switchel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A haymaker\u2019s punch, or switchel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ola O Smit/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I hadn\u2019t heard of Switchel until recently. It\u2019s a type of shrub of Caribbean origin (also known as haymaker\u2019s punch), that found its way to rural America, where it was drunk by the workers in the fields. It\u2019s much more enjoyable than drinking cider vinegar on its own. Adjust the quantities to your own taste.</p> <p>Prep <strong>5 min<br></strong>Serves <strong>2</strong></p> <p><strong>1\u20132 tsp (5\u201310g) grated fresh ginger</strong>, to taste<br><strong>3 tbsp raw cider vinegar<br>2\u20133 tbsp maple syrup or raw honey<br>1 tsp freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice<br>400ml still or sparkling water</strong>, plus extra to dilute</p> <p>Put everything in a sterilised, wide-necked bottle or jar and seal.

      "bodyText": "Red \u2018wine\u2019 hot chocolate (pictured above) Feel free to play around with the quantities, depending on how intense and bitter you like your hot chocolate (I err on the dark side). The wine element may sound weird, but it adds a gorgeous, berry fruitiness to the drink. Prep 15 min Serves 2 1 tbsp cocoa powder \u00bc tsp ground cinnamon 200ml whole milk 75ml alcohol-free red wine, or elderberry juice 1\u20132 squares dark chocolate, plus a little extra, grated, to garnish Squirty cream and/or marshmallows, to garnish Put the cocoa powder and cinnamon in a small bowl. Heat the milk in a small saucepan over a medium heat until just below boiling, then pour enough hot milk over the cocoa mix just to make a smooth, runny paste. Pour the paste into the saucepan of milk, add the \u2018wine\u2019, and heat again to just below simmering point. Take off the heat, add the chocolate and stir until melted. Pour into two small mugs or heatproof glasses, and top each with a generous squirt of cream and/or a couple of marshmallows. Finish with a grating of dark chocolate. Cranberry cordial You can, of course, buy cranberry juice everywhere, but this cordial has a much more intense flavour and a vivid, scarlet colour. Save the strained fruit and use it as a topping for muesli, stir it into porridge or add it to a fruit loaf or teabread. Prep 15 min Cool 24-48 hr Makes About 600ml 250g granulated sugar 400ml water 200g fresh cranberries, rinsed 2 finely pared strips of unwaxed orange or clementine rind 1 cinnamon stick 30ml freshly squeezed orange or clementine juice, strained Soda or sparkling water, to serve Put the sugar in a saucepan and add the water. Heat over a low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil, then add the cranberries, orange or clementine rind, and the cinnamon, and simmer for five minutes, until the skins of the cranberries have split but the berries are still holding their shape. Take off the heat, add the orange or clementine juice, and leave to cool. Strain through a fine sieve into a wide-necked jug or bowl, then pour through a funnel into a sterilised bottle or other clean airtight container. Seal and refrigerate for 24\u201348 hours before using; it will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks. To serve, dilute 4:1 or 5:1 with soda or sparkling water. Turmeric latte Also known as golden mylk, turmeric latte has been one of the iconic vegan drinks of the past few years, but it\u2019s actually quite simple to make at home. The whisking may sound like a bit of a performance, but it\u2019s actually key to the drink, because it integrates the spices fully and gives it that luxuriant, foamy texture. You may find you need slightly more turmeric, depending on the strength and freshness of the one you have, while the pepper helps to activate its health-giving properties. Prep 10 min Makes 1 mug or 2 smaller cups 225ml coconut, almond or oat milk \u2013 I like Rebel Kitchen Mylk, which contains coconut cream, brown rice and cashew \u00bd tsp ground turmeric \u00bc tsp ground cinnamon \u215b tsp ground ginger \u215b tsp finely ground black pepper 1 tsp agave or maple syrup, or honey if you\u2019re not vegan Pour the milk into a saucepan and add all the remaining ingredients. Heat over a moderate heat, whisking all the time with a small balloon whisk or milk frother, until it\u2019s nice and frothy, then pour into a mug or two smaller cups; if you want a smoother texture, pour the mixture through a fine strainer. Switchel I hadn\u2019t heard of Switchel until recently. It\u2019s a type of shrub of Caribbean origin (also known as haymaker\u2019s punch), that found its way to rural America, where it was drunk by the workers in the fields. It\u2019s much more enjoyable than drinking cider vinegar on its own. Adjust the quantities to your own taste. Prep 5 min Serves 2 1\u20132 tsp (5\u201310g) grated fresh ginger, to taste 3 tbsp raw cider vinegar 2\u20133 tbsp maple syrup or raw honey 1 tsp freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice 400ml still or sparkling water, plus extra to dilute Put everything in a sterilised, wide-necked bottle or jar and seal. Give it a shake, taste, adjust the sweetness, then refrigerate for 24 hours. Strain through a fine sieve, pour into glasses, and top with extra still or sparkling water, to taste. Chocolate espresso martini One of the great things about the number of alcohol-free drinks on the market now is how easy it is to find a good base for a cocktail. The London-based company Tipplesworth is an example \u2013 I especially love its espresso martini mix, which can be shaken up just as well with an alcohol-free spirit as with vodka, though you may need to adjust the sweetness by adding an extra shot (or two) of espresso. Prep 15 min Serves 2 1 double shot espresso 2 tsp cocoa powder 100ml alcohol-free spirit, such as Stryyk Not Vodka or Seedlip Spice 94 100ml espresso martini cocktail mixer, such as Tipplesworth 2\u20134 roasted coffee beans, to garnish Brew the espresso. Spoon the cocoa powder into a cocktail shaker, then pour over the espresso and leave to cool. Once cool, add some ice to the shaker, along with the alcohol-free spirit and espresso martini mixer, and shake well. Strain into two martini glasses and garnish each with a roasted coffee bean or two. Banana, coconut and cardamom lassi I wasn\u2019t sure whether to make this a smoothie or a lassi, because it in fact works as both. The lassi is slightly more savoury, while the smoothie is sweeter. Adjust the quantities, depending on how banana-y, coconutty and cardamom-y you want it. Prep 10 min Serves 2 1 medium-large ripe banana, organic for preference \u2013 the skin needs to have developed a few black spots 2 heaped tbsp dairy or dairy-free coconut yoghurt \u00bc tsp ground cardamom, or a little more to taste Peel and slice the banana into a blender or food processor. Add the yoghurt and ground cardamom, and blend smooth. Add 100ml water and whizz again. Divide between two glasses and serve. Tip: to ice the lassi, put three or four ice cubes in the blender and crush before you add the other ingredients; if you do so, omit the water. \u2022 Recipes from Fiona Beckett\u2019s new book, How to Drink Without Drinking: Celebratory Alcohol-Free Drinks for any Time of the Day, published by Kyle Books at \u00a315.99.

They were advised not only to avoid drinking the water, but also touching it \u2013 no showers, no baths, not even hand-washing.</p> <p>Boiling the water would only increase its toxicity while drinking it could cause \u201cabnormal liver function, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, numbness or dizziness\u201d, read a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cityoftoledo/posts/urgent-notice-to-residents-of-toledo-lucas-county-who-receive-water-from-the-cit/738905586173078/\">statement</a> from the City of Toledo, warning residents to \u201cseek medical attention if you feel you have been exposed\u201d.</p> <p>Toledo sits on the shores of Lake Erie, one of North America\u2019s five great lakes. About half a million residents of the city and surrounding area have relied on Lake Erie for water for hundreds of years.</p> <p>After the news broke on 3 August bottled water quickly vanished in concentric circles around the city. Eventually, a state of emergency was called and the national guard arrived with drinking water.</p> <p>Toledo\u2019s water crisis lasted for nearly three days. But the water wasn\u2019t toxic due to an oil spill or high lead levels, as in Flint, Michigan. Toledo\u2019s water was tainted by something altogether different: an algae bloom.<br><br>Toledo is not alone.

Algae are not officially a taxonomic group of creatures (they don\u2019t fit into general groups like plants, animals or fungi), but the name is generally used to describe marine or freshwater species that depend on photosynthesis.</p> <p>An algae bloom occurs when a single member of these species \u2013 because of certain conditions \u2013 suddenly becomes dominant for a time.</p> <p>Algae are vital to our survival. It\u2019s estimated that <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/6/source-of-half-earth-s-oxygen-gets-little-credit/\">at least half</a> of the planet\u2019s oxygen comes from these unsung creatures, who produce it through photosynthesis before releasing it into the water. Algae, like land plants, also sequester carbon dioxide; scientists have explored their <a href=\"http://www.geoengineeringmonitor.org/2016/01/seeds-of-doubt-over-iron-boost-for-algae/\">potential</a> to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. They have been used as fertiliser, food sources (such as seaweed), and could be a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016EF000486\">promising source</a><a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016EF000486\"> of biofuel</a> in a more sustainable world.</p> <p>However, some algae blooms can also be harmful \u2013 even lethal.</p> <p>Harmful algae bloom (HAB), as scientists have come to describe the phenomenon, often manifest by forming a kind of scum over a body of water that can be green, blue, brown or even red. But others are completely invisible. The problem has become increasingly widespread and the impact can be deadly to marine life.</p> <p>Off the eastern coast of the US, a dinoflagellate \u2013 a type of marine plankton named <em>Alexandrium catenella</em> \u2013 has the potential to make shellfish lethal. Its appearance routinely shuts down fisheries, crippling local economies.

Freshwater blooms, like those in Lake Erie made up of cyanobacteria or blue-green algae, have not only shut down local water sources but have also been blamed for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/11/us/three-dogs-died-algae-trnd/index.html\">the death of dogs</a> that had been swimming in them.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to make generalisations about harmful algae blooms since specific species have different causes and impacts.

Until the turn of the millennium, large-scale toxic blooms were rare off the coast of California. Then something changed.</p> <p>\u201cFrom [2000] forward, we had a very significant bloom every single year with ecosystem impacts in California, and that has never stopped. Not only that, it seemed as though things were getting more and more toxic,\u201d says Clarissa Anderson, the executive director at Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System, nothing that in less than 20 years of research, scientists have seen toxin numbers multiply by 200 \u2013 from 500 to 100,000 nanograms per litre of sea water. <br><br>Anderson says the current best working theory is that increasing carbon sequestration by the oceans \u2013 due to the huge increase in greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution \u2013 is behind the sudden regularity of these deadly blooms and an increase in their toxicity. She says the study of these events and their toxins is so new that there may be incidents of illness from eating affected fish or shellfish that are misdiagnosed because these poisons are not on the radar of many health organisations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"14d4a2efdfb8578aeb7e5574783e77ca522c4d79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14d4a2efdfb8578aeb7e5574783e77ca522c4d79/0_0_1920_1358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blue-green algal blooms in the Baltic Sea in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blue-green algal blooms in the Baltic Sea in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ESA/Finnish Environment Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Baltic\u2019s dead zones</h2> <p>Europe has had its own experience of deadly algae blooms that now threaten the future of its fisheries. Last year, the Baltic Sea experienced a<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-baltic/toxic-algae-spreads-in-baltic-waters-in-biggest-bloom-in-years-idUSKBN1KM5RX\"> bloom</a> so large it could have encompassed Manhattan, and it closed beaches from Finland to Poland. <br><br>Finland has been systematically sampling its area of the Baltic since 1979, giving us a clearer idea of the spread and growth of the problem, and what\u2019s to blame. In that time, blooms have become larger and longer-lasting, creating dead zones and <a href=\"https://www.bsag.fi/en/baltic-sea/eutrophication/\">depleting</a> Baltic fisheries.</p> <p>Like the example in Lake Erie, the Baltic bloom is caused by an influx of nutrients from agriculture and warming waters.<br><br>Scientists are regularly tracking nutrient loads from Finland\u2019s rivers into the sea. Data from 2014 in the HELCOM Pollution Load Compilation database, the best currently available, found that more than three-quarters of the nutrient load coming into the Archipelago Sea is from agriculture. The number is surprisingly similar to the proportion coming from industrialised agriculture in Ohio.</p> <p>The Baltic is a brackish water body, thus supporting blooms typical of both fresh and salt water. But, as in Lake Erie, of real concern are cyanobacteria: several species have been known to produce blooms here.</p> <p>Below the sea\u2019s surface there has been a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130613092202.htm\">decline</a> in the more nutritious phytoplankton \u2013 and food for fish \u2013 and an increase in the potentially toxic species in the more southerly parts of the sea since the early 1980s.<br><br>Milder winters and increased rainfall pushing more nutrients into the sea, along with higher surface water temperatures \u2013 all due to the climate crisis \u2013 are also exacerbating factors, say researchers. Blooms usually begin in July and disappear by August or September. But last year a species particularly resistant to coldremained until November. <br><br>\u201cThe ice was blue-green because of the cyanobacteria under it,\u201d says Sirpa Lehtinen, an expert on plankton for the Marine Research Centre with the Finnish Environmental Institute, who adds that scientists are still trying to work out what this all means for the marine ecosystem, and whether fisheries in the Baltic are in serious long-term peril.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"e4edc62d4b3e96f035a69c8ed9f9d46294cfea30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4edc62d4b3e96f035a69c8ed9f9d46294cfea30/0_255_2732_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scientists conduct research into Lake Erie\u2019s harmful algal bloom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"469\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scientists conducting research into Lake Erie\u2019s harmful algal bloom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David J Ruck/Great Lakes Outreach Media/NOAA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Fixing an ecosystem out of balance</h2> <p>So how can we solve a problem like algae? The answer, says Davis, will be part-regional, part-global solutions. For Lake Erie, it will require agricultural changes \u2013 including regulations to reduce the nutrient load \u2013 and tackling the climate crisis. But solutions elsewhere may be different, for example, blooms in developing countries might require better wastewater treatment.</p> <p>The 2014 water crisis in Ohio forced the issue politically which hasn\u2019t happened in many other places. Governor Mike DeWine recently announced an initiative called H2Ohio, which is expected to include hundreds of millions of dollars for Lake Erie and other Ohio water bodies over the next 10 years. However, scientists say this is not enough.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot more money and a lot more political will than what\u2019s happening right now,\u201d says Bridgeman.</p> <p>At the Ohio Department of Agriculture,director Dorothy Pelanda said the department was primarily looking at voluntary programmes based on marketing and education for potential solutions such as cover crops and smarter use of fertiliser. In 2014, Ohio passed new regulations on fertiliser use for farms near the lake: such as not spreading before a storm or on frozen fields.</p> <p>\u201cWe know from science that there is not one solution to every farm \u2026 It\u2019s about education, it\u2019s about being sensitive to what works, what doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said. She\u2019s hoping to provide increased access for farmers to use high-tech, but often expensive, equipment that can give them a better idea of what parts of their land may need fertiliser and how much.</p> <p>Pelanda said she\u2019s also seen interest in diversifying crops beyond corn and soya beans, to grapes, chestnuts and maple sugar. Asked if voluntary programmes will go far enough, Pelanda says: \u201cThat\u2019s our challenge. We have to get beyond. We\u2019re doing these things \u2026 but we\u2019re not doing enough of these things. We need to really increase the voluntary adoption of these practices.\u201d</p> <p>Others are more sceptical of voluntary approaches. \u201cWe have a long history in this country of a farmer does what he wants on his land. You can choose to take advantage of a programme or something, but you can also choose not to,\u201d says Bridgeman, who believes local and federal governments can no longer afford to ignore the climate emergency. <br><br>\u201cWe need to do something about climate change and we\u2019re either going to be paying for it by reducing greenhouse gases or we\u2019re going to be paying for it by additional treatment of water,\u201d says Bridgeman, adding that most of the blooms around the world have a human element to them.</p> <p>One thing is certain. Algae blooms aren\u2019t going away but are yet another sign \u2013 like ocean acidification, vanishing Arctic sea ice, and mass extinction of the Anthropocene \u2013 \u201cof an ecosystem that is out of balance,\u201d says McFarland.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 January 2020 to remove a reference to \u201ctoxic cryptophytes\u201d. Cryptophytes are not toxic. Also, the text was changed to clarify that baltic bloom in Lake Erie is caused by a range of nutrients, not just nitrogen from farming.<br><br><br><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "On 3 August 2014, residents of Toledo, Ohio, woke to the news that overnight their water supply had become toxic. They were advised not only to avoid drinking the water, but also touching it \u2013 no showers, no baths, not even hand-washing. Boiling the water would only increase its toxicity while drinking it could cause \u201cabnormal liver function, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, numbness or dizziness\u201d, read a statement from the City of Toledo, warning residents to \u201cseek medical attention if you feel you have been exposed\u201d. Toledo sits on the shores of Lake Erie, one of North America\u2019s five great lakes. About half a million residents of the city and surrounding area have relied on Lake Erie for water for hundreds of years. After the news broke on 3 August bottled water quickly vanished in concentric circles around the city. Eventually, a state of emergency was called and the national guard arrived with drinking water. Toledo\u2019s water crisis lasted for nearly three days. But the water wasn\u2019t toxic due to an oil spill or high lead levels, as in Flint, Michigan. Toledo\u2019s water was tainted by something altogether different: an algae bloom. Toledo is not alone. According to scientists, algae blooms are becoming more frequent and more toxic worldwide. A 14-month long algae bloom in Florida, known as the \u201cred tide\u201d, only ended earlier this year, after killing more than 100 manatees, 127 dolphins and 589 sea turtles. Hundreds of tonnes of dead fish also washed ashore. In 2018, there were more than 300 reported incidents of toxic or harmful algae blooms around the world. This year about 130 have been listed on an international database, but that number is expected to increase. Recent reports of a new \u2018\u2018red tide\u2019\u2019 emerging in Florida and more dead wildlife have put the tourist and fishing industries on alert, braced for further devastation. The causes of the blooms vary, and in some cases are never known, but in many parts of the world they are being increasingly linked to climate change and industrialised agriculture. What is a harmful algae bloom? Algae includes everything from micro-algae, like microscopic diatoms, to very large algae, such as seaweed and kelp. Algae are not officially a taxonomic group of creatures (they don\u2019t fit into general groups like plants, animals or fungi), but the name is generally used to describe marine or freshwater species that depend on photosynthesis. An algae bloom occurs when a single member of these species \u2013 because of certain conditions \u2013 suddenly becomes dominant for a time. Algae are vital to our survival. It\u2019s estimated that at least half of the planet\u2019s oxygen comes from these unsung creatures, who produce it through photosynthesis before releasing it into the water. Algae, like land plants, also sequester carbon dioxide; scientists have explored their potential to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. They have been used as fertiliser, food sources (such as seaweed), and could be a promising source of biofuel in a more sustainable world. However, some algae blooms can also be harmful \u2013 even lethal. Harmful algae bloom (HAB), as scientists have come to describe the phenomenon, often manifest by forming a kind of scum over a body of water that can be green, blue, brown or even red. But others are completely invisible. The problem has become increasingly widespread and the impact can be deadly to marine life. Off the eastern coast of the US, a dinoflagellate \u2013 a type of marine plankton named Alexandrium catenella \u2013 has the potential to make shellfish lethal. Its appearance routinely shuts down fisheries, crippling local economies. And it\u2019s not just in the US: the same species has shut down mussel farms and recreational collecting of shellfish as far away as New Zealand. Other blooms wipe out marine life. In 2015, a bloom of various dinoflagellates off the coast of South Africa led to low-oxygen conditions, known as eutrophication, killing 200 tonnes of rock lobster. Freshwater blooms, like those in Lake Erie made up of cyanobacteria or blue-green algae, have not only shut down local water sources but have also been blamed for the death of dogs that had been swimming in them. It\u2019s difficult to make generalisations about harmful algae blooms since specific species have different causes and impacts. Scientists have identified about 100 toxic bloom species in the oceans. Dozens of potentially harmful species of cyanobacteria are known to affect bodies of fresh water. During most of the past century, harmful algae blooms were rarely headline news, inspiring little scientific study beyond ecological curiosity. That has changed. Algae blooms are notoriously difficult to predict, but a global monitoring group known as HAEDAT is tracking them across the world as they occur. Harmful algae blooms, such as the one that hit Toledo\u2019s water supply in 2014, are becoming more common and more toxic \u2013 and scientists say humans are to blame. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the HAB problem is a major global issue, and it is growing,\u201d said Donald Anderson, director of the US National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms and a lab director at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. \u201cWe also have more toxins, more toxic species, more areas and resources affected, and higher economic losses.\u201d Hidden cost of Ohio\u2019s corn and soya bean boom The toxic bloom that took over Lake Erie in 2014 was formed by a cyanobacteria known as Microcystis Aeruginosa, for which farming is at least partly to blame. \u201cYou have people that still to this day will only use bottled water,\u201d says Dr Timothy Davis, an expert in plankton ecology at Bowling Green University, five years after the water crisis and even after Toledo spent $132 million (\u00a3101 million) on improving its water treatment plant to handle the blue-green algae. Lake Erie, the shallowest of North America\u2019s Great Lakes, has seen such events in the past. During the 1950s and 60s algae blooms were common, most likely, say researchers, due to poor domestic and industrial wastewater treatment. \u201cAt one point, Lake Erie was considered a dead lake,\u201d Davis says. But by the early 1970s, the \u201cdead lake\u201d was resurrected, due to new regulations from the Clean Water Act and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement that capped phosphorus loads into the lake at 11,000 tonnes. Phosphorus provides nutrients to plants and is commonly found in manure and produced for fertiliser. Then in the late-1990s, blooms began to reappear. A cyanobacteria bloom requires two things: nutrients and heat. In the case of Lake Erie, nearby farms have become increasingly reliant on large inputs of synthetic fertiliser. \u201cWe went from agriculture that was small farms [and a] variety of crops to larger commercial farms that were harvested for essentially two row crops, corn and soya beans,\u201d says Davis. Today, corn and soya beans are Ohio\u2019s top crops. Employing more fertiliser to feed a global market, the farms\u2019 excess phosphorus and nitrogen, another plant nutrient, washed out during storms and into the river and streams that feed Lake Erie. About 80% of the nutrients running into Lake Erie are from sources around the Maumee River, which in this case means agricultural runoff from the surrounding farmland. \u201cIf you have an agricultural system where the farmer can only survive by polluting Lake Erie, then there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong with that system,\u201d says Dr Thomas Bridgeman, director of the Lake Erie Center. Since the 1990s, Lake Erie has seen a bloom every year \u2013 and they appear to be lasting longer and getting larger. This year\u2019s bloom in Lake Erie was the fifth largest since 2002 \u2013 when monitoring began in earnest. It was 620 square miles at its largest after growing throughout August, before dissipating in September. Meanwhile, climate change has heated up our planet substantially. Nearby Lake Superior, the most northerly of the Great Lakes and the world\u2019s largest, has had its first documented cyanobacteria blooms over the past decade. Before climate change, the lake simply would have been too cold for a long-lasting bloom. It\u2019s now almost a certainty that blooms will continue to appear every summer, say researchers, unless Ohio changes its agricultural practices and the global community finally tackles the climate crisis. \u201cWe have to look around and say, \u2018Look, what do we grow here?\u2019\u201d says Bridgeman. \u201cWe grow corn and soya beans. Where does the corn go? It goes into our gas tanks. Where do the soya beans go? They go to China, they go to hogs. Is that really what we want to be doing with our watershed?\u201d Dead manatees and sick sea lions Algal blooms are also becoming more common and severe in many parts of our oceans, harming wildlife and posing potentially dangerous health impacts for local communities. Scientists say the \u201cred tide\u201d that stuck around the Florida coast from 2017 through to this year may now be a semi-normal part of the ecosystem. These blooms are pumping poison into the air, known as brevetoxin, which may be harmful to humans if inhaled. Anyone breathing it in can suffer from uncontrollable coughing and a sore throat. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make for a pleasant day at the beach,\u201d says Malcolm McFarland, a researcher into algae blooms with the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute in Fort Pierce, Florida. It may have long-term health implications as well \u2013 one study found that brevetoxin attacked the DNA of lungs in rats, but further research is needed to understand the impact on human health. Scientists are less certain about the causes of these red tide marine blooms, but both nutrient runoff and climate change may play a role. \u201cThe red tide seems to initiate and peak in the rainy season when runoff from the land is highest, and nutrient inputs to freshwater and coastal water bodies spike,\u201d says McFarland. Meanwhile, on the other side of the north American continent, a different red tide is attacking a different species: California is seeing more sick sea lions taken in by rescue centres; pups and adults are dying. Scientists believe they are suffering from eating fish tainted by Pseudo-nitzschia australis algae. The highly toxic algae are fatal at high doses, both to sea lions and humans. Unlike Florida\u2019s red tides, those in California appear to be a very recent arrival. Until the turn of the millennium, large-scale toxic blooms were rare off the coast of California. Then something changed. \u201cFrom [2000] forward, we had a very significant bloom every single year with ecosystem impacts in California, and that has never stopped. Not only that, it seemed as though things were getting more and more toxic,\u201d says Clarissa Anderson, the executive director at Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System, nothing that in less than 20 years of research, scientists have seen toxin numbers multiply by 200 \u2013 from 500 to 100,000 nanograms per litre of sea water. Anderson says the current best working theory is that increasing carbon sequestration by the oceans \u2013 due to the huge increase in greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution \u2013 is behind the sudden regularity of these deadly blooms and an increase in their toxicity. She says the study of these events and their toxins is so new that there may be incidents of illness from eating affected fish or shellfish that are misdiagnosed because these poisons are not on the radar of many health organisations. The Baltic\u2019s dead zones Europe has had its own experience of deadly algae blooms that now threaten the future of its fisheries. Last year, the Baltic Sea experienced a bloom so large it could have encompassed Manhattan, and it closed beaches from Finland to Poland. Finland has been systematically sampling its area of the Baltic since 1979, giving us a clearer idea of the spread and growth of the problem, and what\u2019s to blame. In that time, blooms have become larger and longer-lasting, creating dead zones and depleting Baltic fisheries. Like the example in Lake Erie, the Baltic bloom is caused by an influx of nutrients from agriculture and warming waters. Scientists are regularly tracking nutrient loads from Finland\u2019s rivers into the sea. Data from 2014 in the HELCOM Pollution Load Compilation database, the best currently available, found that more than three-quarters of the nutrient load coming into the Archipelago Sea is from agriculture. The number is surprisingly similar to the proportion coming from industrialised agriculture in Ohio. The Baltic is a brackish water body, thus supporting blooms typical of both fresh and salt water. But, as in Lake Erie, of real concern are cyanobacteria: several species have been known to produce blooms here. Below the sea\u2019s surface there has been a decline in the more nutritious phytoplankton \u2013 and food for fish \u2013 and an increase in the potentially toxic species in the more southerly parts of the sea since the early 1980s. Milder winters and increased rainfall pushing more nutrients into the sea, along with higher surface water temperatures \u2013 all due to the climate crisis \u2013 are also exacerbating factors, say researchers. Blooms usually begin in July and disappear by August or September. But last year a species particularly resistant to coldremained until November. \u201cThe ice was blue-green because of the cyanobacteria under it,\u201d says Sirpa Lehtinen, an expert on plankton for the Marine Research Centre with the Finnish Environmental Institute, who adds that scientists are still trying to work out what this all means for the marine ecosystem, and whether fisheries in the Baltic are in serious long-term peril. Fixing an ecosystem out of balance So how can we solve a problem like algae? The answer, says Davis, will be part-regional, part-global solutions. For Lake Erie, it will require agricultural changes \u2013 including regulations to reduce the nutrient load \u2013 and tackling the climate crisis. But solutions elsewhere may be different, for example, blooms in developing countries might require better wastewater treatment. The 2014 water crisis in Ohio forced the issue politically which hasn\u2019t happened in many other places. Governor Mike DeWine recently announced an initiative called H2Ohio, which is expected to include hundreds of millions of dollars for Lake Erie and other Ohio water bodies over the next 10 years. However, scientists say this is not enough. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot more money and a lot more political will than what\u2019s happening right now,\u201d says Bridgeman. At the Ohio Department of Agriculture,director Dorothy Pelanda said the department was primarily looking at voluntary programmes based on marketing and education for potential solutions such as cover crops and smarter use of fertiliser. In 2014, Ohio passed new regulations on fertiliser use for farms near the lake: such as not spreading before a storm or on frozen fields. \u201cWe know from science that there is not one solution to every farm \u2026 It\u2019s about education, it\u2019s about being sensitive to what works, what doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said. She\u2019s hoping to provide increased access for farmers to use high-tech, but often expensive, equipment that can give them a better idea of what parts of their land may need fertiliser and how much. Pelanda said she\u2019s also seen interest in diversifying crops beyond corn and soya beans, to grapes, chestnuts and maple sugar. Asked if voluntary programmes will go far enough, Pelanda says: \u201cThat\u2019s our challenge. We have to get beyond. We\u2019re doing these things \u2026 but we\u2019re not doing enough of these things. We need to really increase the voluntary adoption of these practices.\u201d Others are more sceptical of voluntary approaches. \u201cWe have a long history in this country of a farmer does what he wants on his land. You can choose to take advantage of a programme or something, but you can also choose not to,\u201d says Bridgeman, who believes local and federal governments can no longer afford to ignore the climate emergency. \u201cWe need to do something about climate change and we\u2019re either going to be paying for it by reducing greenhouse gases or we\u2019re going to be paying for it by additional treatment of water,\u201d says Bridgeman, adding that most of the blooms around the world have a human element to them. One thing is certain. Algae blooms aren\u2019t going away but are yet another sign \u2013 like ocean acidification, vanishing Arctic sea ice, and mass extinction of the Anthropocene \u2013 \u201cof an ecosystem that is out of balance,\u201d says McFarland. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 January 2020 to remove a reference to \u201ctoxic cryptophytes\u201d. Cryptophytes are not toxic. Also, the text was changed to clarify that baltic bloom in Lake Erie is caused by a range of nutrients, not just nitrogen from farming.",

For most of Britain at the time \u2013 and certainly for this 13-year-old and his schoolfriends growing up in 1960s Leeds \u2013 the Profumo affair overwhelmingly meant the thrilling opportunity of talking publicly about sex for the first time.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.wussu.com/poems/plam.htm\">his poem Annus Mirabilis</a>, Philip Larkin wrote that sexual intercourse \u201cbegan in nineteen sixty-three\u201d. Larkin placed this moment \u201csomewhere between\u201d the lifting of the ban on DH Lawrence\u2019s Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover in November 1960 and the issuing of the Beatles\u2019 first album Please Please Me in March 1963. It was indeed in March 1963 that the Profumo affair first became public.</p> <p>But the start of sexual intercourse can be dated more precisely, to the afternoon of Saturday 8 July 1961. \u201cIt did not quite seem it at the time,\u201d says the historian David Kynaston, but the date was \u201cone for the history books\u201d. The Labour politician and diarist Richard Crossman, who would play a role in the Profumo affair, was in Workington (\u201ca wholly working-class, dreary little place\u201d he called it, little knowing what would happen to his party there in 2019). Meanwhile, in the grounds of Cliveden House, a semi-naked Keeler emerged from a swimming pool and met Profumo for the first time, again little knowing where this would lead.</p> <p>Thanks to Kynaston\u2019s researches, I can remember exactly where I was that afternoon myself. I was watching as Freddie Trueman, my total boyhood hero, bowling from the Kirkstall Lane end, destroyed the Australian batting in the third Ashes test at Headingley. Life felt as if it could not get any better. And on the same afternoon perhaps Profumo thought something like that too.</p> <p>It is often said that if the Profumo scandal had simply been about sex it would not have had such a overwhelming impact. Harold Macmillan, the prime minister, thought this at the outset. \u201cI was forced to spend a great deal of today over a silly scrape (women this time, thank God, not boys),\u201d he wrote in his diary for 15 March 1963.</p> <p>What made the \u201cscrape\u201d more serious, Macmillan believed, was that the Soviet naval attache was involved with Keeler too. This was the connection on which Labour, Crossman included, would seize when the issue finally reached parliament a few days later. But what brought Profumo down was that he lied to his party and to the House of Commons.</p> <p>According to Iain Macleod, the leader of the Commons, he asked Profumo: \u201cLook Jack, the basic question is \u2018Did you fuck her?\u2019\u201d Profumo gave his word he had not. The Tory high command accepted this. Perhaps, as Macleod\u2019s biographer Robert Shepherd argues, they believed him because so many ministers of that era were \u201cmembers of the generation of Conservatives who had served as officers in the war\u201d. A chap\u2019s word was enough.</p> <p>Except that it wasn\u2019t. Profumo finally admitted his lie in June and resigned. But this was not the end of the Profumo scandal. Macmillan called in the judge Lord Denning to write a report into the affair; published three months later, it became a bestseller. Rumours abounded \u2013 about other ministers, duchesses, film stars, royals \u2013 during a heady summer of titillation. Macmillan\u2019s authority was already on the slide (the prime minister would resign in the autumn).</p> <p>\u201cHe was in a terrible state,\u201d Macleod recalled. \u201cGoing on about a rumour of there having been eight high court judges involved in some orgy. \u2018One\u2019, he said, \u2018perhaps two, conceivably.

Why did we decide to sign up?</h2> <p>The Guardian has always been a purpose-led organisation, and this year we committed to focusing on that even more. B Corporations are companies that value purpose as much as profit, so it felt like a natural fit with our own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/2015/jul/26/the-scott-trust\">values</a>. Being a B Corp means a few different things: it\u2019s a way of having a rigorous, objective view of where we are doing well and where we need to work harder when it comes to our environmental and social impact. It\u2019s a way of demonstrating to our readers what type of business we are and it\u2019s also a community of like-minded businesses that want to share ideas and encourage each other.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/07/b-corp-leed-fair-trade-certification-sustainability-lab-danone-group-black-rock-unilever\">Can B Corp be the next Fair Trade for socially-minded corporations?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Why is this a significant step?</h2> <p>A lot of companies are talking about the idea of \u201cpurpose\u201d at the moment so it\u2019s important to us that we can demonstrate to our readers that we are doing more than just talking \u2013 we are actually acting on things like our working practices, how we recruit, our environmental performance and how we support local communities. We believe we are the first major media organisation to become a B Corp anywhere in the world so we are proud to have taken this step.</p> <h2>How many B Corp-certified organisations are there worldwide?</h2> <p>There are currently about 3,000 certified companies globally. The certification started in the US and around half of all certified companies are based there, but it is growing quickly in Europe and beyond. The outdoor clothing brand Patagonia is one of the best known B Corps, the Body Shop recently certified and food company Danone is in the process of certifying all of its subsidiaries. There are also lots of smaller companies doing everything from law to teabags to wetsuits! It feels like consumer and business attitudes are changing really quickly and people increasingly want to know that companies are behaving in an ethical way.</p> <h2>What are we committing to, and in what timeframe?</h2> <p>We have committed to being carbon neutral by 2030 and we already have a target of eliminating the gender pay gap in the top half of our organisation by 2022. We\u2019re already doing a lot of work to be a more diverse and representative employer, which will continue to be a priority. We\u2019re currently working on a plan for what other specific improvements we want to achieve by the time we get reassessed in three years.</p> <h2>How will our success be measured?</h2> <p>The B Corp assessment measures our performance across five areas - governance, workers, community, environment and customers. We have to recertify every three years so we will be able to track our progress.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7d543bd8d1d1af56cfa64be0282c4cf120fbee93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d543bd8d1d1af56cfa64be0282c4cf120fbee93/0_0_3500_5250/667.jpg\" alt=\"Heavy smog in Delhi earlier this month.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heavy smog in Delhi earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Money Sharma/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><br>We have also announced environmental commitments, as set out in the recent climate pledge. Is that tied to our B Corp status?</h2> <p>Our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/16/the-guardians-climate-pledge-2019\">climate pledge</a> was really driven by our reporting on the severity of the climate crisis, and the strength of feeling among our readers and our staff. We believe that the world is in the grip of an environmental emergency but too many governments and businesses are not taking meaningful action to address it. The biggest way that we can play a role is through our reporting, highlighting the impact of the climate crisis on communities around the world and helping our readers to understand the issue. But it was also important to us that we held ourselves to account and made a commitment to improve our own performance. The more companies that commit to net zero, the more momentum there will be to develop solutions, and hopefully the more pressure it will put on governments to take meaningful action.</p> <h2>How will we reach net zero emissions by 2030?</h2> <p>We are currently in the process of doing a full audit of our carbon emissions, both within our own operations but also across our supply chain. We hope to complete that soon and then identify where we can make the biggest reductions in our footprint. One of the things we will be looking at is how we reduce the amount of air travel. We\u2019ll also be looking at things like where all our energy supplies come from and how we could reduce emissions associated with our printing operations. For example, we previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2019/feb/09/wrapper-guardian-first-national-newspaper-biodegradable\">switched the packaging for some of our weekend papers</a> from plastic to compostable materials, but we are now looking at other alternatives that are easier to recycle.</p> <h2>In what other ways will we reduce our carbon footprint?</h2> <p>Our priority is to reduce the emissions that we cause. We will also look at ways that we can offset the emissions that we can\u2019t remove.

      "bodyText": "What does it mean to be a B Corp organisation? Why did we decide to sign up? The Guardian has always been a purpose-led organisation, and this year we committed to focusing on that even more. B Corporations are companies that value purpose as much as profit, so it felt like a natural fit with our own values. Being a B Corp means a few different things: it\u2019s a way of having a rigorous, objective view of where we are doing well and where we need to work harder when it comes to our environmental and social impact. It\u2019s a way of demonstrating to our readers what type of business we are and it\u2019s also a community of like-minded businesses that want to share ideas and encourage each other. Why is this a significant step? A lot of companies are talking about the idea of \u201cpurpose\u201d at the moment so it\u2019s important to us that we can demonstrate to our readers that we are doing more than just talking \u2013 we are actually acting on things like our working practices, how we recruit, our environmental performance and how we support local communities. We believe we are the first major media organisation to become a B Corp anywhere in the world so we are proud to have taken this step. How many B Corp-certified organisations are there worldwide? There are currently about 3,000 certified companies globally. The certification started in the US and around half of all certified companies are based there, but it is growing quickly in Europe and beyond. The outdoor clothing brand Patagonia is one of the best known B Corps, the Body Shop recently certified and food company Danone is in the process of certifying all of its subsidiaries. There are also lots of smaller companies doing everything from law to teabags to wetsuits! It feels like consumer and business attitudes are changing really quickly and people increasingly want to know that companies are behaving in an ethical way. What are we committing to, and in what timeframe? We have committed to being carbon neutral by 2030 and we already have a target of eliminating the gender pay gap in the top half of our organisation by 2022. We\u2019re already doing a lot of work to be a more diverse and representative employer, which will continue to be a priority. We\u2019re currently working on a plan for what other specific improvements we want to achieve by the time we get reassessed in three years. How will our success be measured? The B Corp assessment measures our performance across five areas - governance, workers, community, environment and customers. We have to recertify every three years so we will be able to track our progress. We have also announced environmental commitments, as set out in the recent climate pledge. Is that tied to our B Corp status? Our climate pledge was really driven by our reporting on the severity of the climate crisis, and the strength of feeling among our readers and our staff. We believe that the world is in the grip of an environmental emergency but too many governments and businesses are not taking meaningful action to address it. The biggest way that we can play a role is through our reporting, highlighting the impact of the climate crisis on communities around the world and helping our readers to understand the issue. But it was also important to us that we held ourselves to account and made a commitment to improve our own performance. The more companies that commit to net zero, the more momentum there will be to develop solutions, and hopefully the more pressure it will put on governments to take meaningful action. How will we reach net zero emissions by 2030? We are currently in the process of doing a full audit of our carbon emissions, both within our own operations but also across our supply chain. We hope to complete that soon and then identify where we can make the biggest reductions in our footprint. One of the things we will be looking at is how we reduce the amount of air travel. We\u2019ll also be looking at things like where all our energy supplies come from and how we could reduce emissions associated with our printing operations. For example, we previously switched the packaging for some of our weekend papers from plastic to compostable materials, but we are now looking at other alternatives that are easier to recycle. In what other ways will we reduce our carbon footprint? Our priority is to reduce the emissions that we cause. We will also look at ways that we can offset the emissions that we can\u2019t remove. We want to approach that in a really thoughtful way as there are a lot of conflicting views about the merits of different offsetting options, and growing cynicism about the ways some companies are using it as a way of appearing green instead of making meaningful change to the way they operate. That doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t do it, but we want to make sure that we support schemes that are verifiable and have a real benefit. How can readers get involved? You can encourage the companies you buy from to become B Corps \u2013 it\u2019s a rigorous certification and if all major companies did it then everything from labour standards to environmental performance would be a lot better! You can advocate for the government to implement stronger corporate standards so that companies are obliged to consider the long-term impact of their actions on employees, the environment and society alongside the impact on shareholders. And we hope that our climate pledge will inspire readers to take action in their own lives, whether it\u2019s taking fewer flights, shopping more locally or reducing the amount of plastic in your life.

However, tougher sentences are needed to act as a stronger deterrent to criminals dumping waste.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why we want to work with the government on reviewing sentencing guidelines for fly-tipping, so offenders are given bigger fines for more serious offences, and ensure councils have the funding needed to investigate incidents.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/22/ea-chief-waste-is-the-new-narcotics\">Waste crime is 'the new narcotics', says Environment Agency chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The underlying causes of the rising trend in fly-tipping are not known for certain, but council officials say they have seen a rise in \u201cman in a van\u201d incidents, where unlicensed operators collect rubbish then dump it.</p> <p>Stricter rules at council tips and charges for some refuse disposal may also be a factor. However, an increase in reporting could be responsible for part of the rise, as councils are providing more ways in which members of the public can report rubbish dumping.</p> <p>Fly-tipping incidents in England fell from 1.3m in 2007-08 to 0.7m in 2012-13, according to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/845171/FlyTipping_201819_Statistical_Release_FINAL_Accessible.pdf\">government data</a>.

In Wiltshire, a man advertising a cheap waste clearance service on Facebook was in fact fly-tipping the rubbish. He was fined \u00a33,275.</p> <p>\u201cIf someone offers to take your waste away cheaply, it will probably end up being fly-tipped in our beautiful countryside,\u201d said the Wiltshire councillor Bridget Wayman. \u201cYou may also find yourself with a \u00a3200 fixed penalty notice and a bill for the clear-up costs.\u201d She advised people to check that operators are properly licensed.</p> <p>Fly-tipping has fallen by half in Wolverhampton after its council launched a \u201cshop a tipper\u201d campaign in January, where residents receive a \u00a3100 gift voucher for information leading to a fine or successful prosecution.</p> <p>The council has also crushed two transit vans and two cars caught fly-tipping on CCTV. \u201cWe do not want fly-tipping in our city. If you don\u2019t pay the fine, we will seize your vehicle and if you don\u2019t come forward to claim it, it will be crushed,\u201d said one councillor, Steve Evans.</p> <p>South Cambridgeshire district council is also trialling a new approach, with signs at hotspots asking \u201cWhy are you fly-tipping?\u201d Among the multiple choice answers on the sign are \u201cI want you to prosecute me\u201d and \u201cMy mum still cleans up after me\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFly tipping is an unacceptable blight on our environment,\u201d said environment secretary Theresa Villiers. \u201cWe\u2019re cracking down on it.

In the nine years to 2013, water companies were punished for more than 1,000 incidents, but fined a total of only \u00a33.5m.

      "bodyText": "Fly-tipping has increased by 50% in the last six years, prompting councils to call for much bigger penalties for offenders. More than a million incidents of illegal rubbish dumping were recorded in the financial year 2018-19, which cost councils \u00a358m to clean up. Most incidents involved household waste being jettisoned from cars or vans by the side of a road. The maximum fine for fly-tipping is \u00a350,000 and/or a five-year prison sentence. But 83% of the court-imposed fines in the last six years were below \u00a3500. Only two people have been given the maximum fine since new guidelines were introduced in 2014. Councils are handing out more on-the-spot fines and pursuing more prosecutions. Offending vehicles can be seized and in some cases are crushed. The number seized jumped to 207 last year. However, councils have lost 60% of their central government funding since 2010, meaning less money is available for action against fly-tippers. \u201cFly-tipping is not only an illegal, inexcusable and ugly blight on society, it is a serious public health risk,\u201d said David Renard, the environment spokesman for the Local Government Association and leader of Swindon borough council. \u201cCouncils are determined to crack down on the problem. However, tougher sentences are needed to act as a stronger deterrent to criminals dumping waste. \u201cThis is why we want to work with the government on reviewing sentencing guidelines for fly-tipping, so offenders are given bigger fines for more serious offences, and ensure councils have the funding needed to investigate incidents.\u201d The underlying causes of the rising trend in fly-tipping are not known for certain, but council officials say they have seen a rise in \u201cman in a van\u201d incidents, where unlicensed operators collect rubbish then dump it. Stricter rules at council tips and charges for some refuse disposal may also be a factor. However, an increase in reporting could be responsible for part of the rise, as councils are providing more ways in which members of the public can report rubbish dumping. Fly-tipping incidents in England fell from 1.3m in 2007-08 to 0.7m in 2012-13, according to government data. But there has been a steady rise since then to 1.1m in 2018-19. Total fines of \u00a31m were levied last year. Recent incidents include a delivery driver caught fly-tipping on four occasions in Hertfordshire being fined \u00a3300. In Wiltshire, a man advertising a cheap waste clearance service on Facebook was in fact fly-tipping the rubbish. He was fined \u00a33,275. \u201cIf someone offers to take your waste away cheaply, it will probably end up being fly-tipped in our beautiful countryside,\u201d said the Wiltshire councillor Bridget Wayman. \u201cYou may also find yourself with a \u00a3200 fixed penalty notice and a bill for the clear-up costs.\u201d She advised people to check that operators are properly licensed. Fly-tipping has fallen by half in Wolverhampton after its council launched a \u201cshop a tipper\u201d campaign in January, where residents receive a \u00a3100 gift voucher for information leading to a fine or successful prosecution. The council has also crushed two transit vans and two cars caught fly-tipping on CCTV. \u201cWe do not want fly-tipping in our city. If you don\u2019t pay the fine, we will seize your vehicle and if you don\u2019t come forward to claim it, it will be crushed,\u201d said one councillor, Steve Evans. South Cambridgeshire district council is also trialling a new approach, with signs at hotspots asking \u201cWhy are you fly-tipping?\u201d Among the multiple choice answers on the sign are \u201cI want you to prosecute me\u201d and \u201cMy mum still cleans up after me\u201d. \u201cFly tipping is an unacceptable blight on our environment,\u201d said environment secretary Theresa Villiers. \u201cWe\u2019re cracking down on it. But I am clear that more must be done to stop these criminals. That is why our Resources and Waste Strategy includes a commitment to strengthen sentencing for fly-tipping.\u201d Penalties were increased in 2014 for a different environmental crime: water pollution. In the nine years to 2013, water companies were punished for more than 1,000 incidents, but fined a total of only \u00a33.5m. But since the change, the fines have been much larger, with Thames Water alone being fined \u00a320m in 2017 after huge leaks of untreated sewage into the Thames and its tributaries.",

He plundered his maiden double-century in a superb display of concentration and accumulation. Around him batsmen came and went, and the tail refused to wag, making his 215 all the more valuable and impressive. </p> <p>New Zealand\u2019s makeshift attack stuck to its task well and in Todd Astle they\u2019ve found a leg-spinner worth persevering with.

Regardless, though most tests currently only last 4 days anyway, my fear would be that officially shortening the duration would result in a lot more teams pulling down the shutters early and holding on for draws. How many wins currently come down to a team being 3 down in the 4<sup>th</sup> innings at the start of day 4 and staring at the mountain of surviving 180 overs or scoring 400 runs? Plus \u2013 5 day tests are a Tex Perkins-like gesture to the banality of broadcasting/advertising executives who increasingly call the shots in all modern sport.\u201d</p> <p>Also, a lot of assumptions about how many overs would fit into a day. With the exception of New Zealand, is there a team that consistently gets through their 90? Let alone another eight, even with an additional half an hour.

A lovely moment for the veteran tweaker, his name into the book on his old New South Wales home ground. <br></p> <p><strong>91st over: Australia 288-4 (Labuschagne 135)</strong> <br></p> <p>Earlier in the over, it only took three balls, Labuschagne dancing down the track and hammering Somerville over midwicket for four runs. Just as it was when he walked out yesterday, he\u2019s hitting the ball in the middle of the bat straight away. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-03T23:38:08.443Z\">at 11.38pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e0fce548f087e8308e683ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-03T23:31:31.800Z\">11.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The players are on the field. </strong>Labuschagne bounces past the flags, leading Wade to the middle. \u201cIt looks like a good batting surface but it is definitely going to deteriorate,\u201d says Simon Katich on SEN radio.

Just as it was yesterday, there is a cloud hanging over this Test, and across the country, as Australia wakes up to a truly harrowing weather forecast for the day ahead. Of course, it is going to be impossible to concentrate entirely on the cricket as news comes in from Victoria and New South Wales, but I\u2019ll try my best to keep things as normal as possible on here, for what it\u2019s worth.</p> <p>When play does resume at the SCG it\u2019ll be with Australia in a predicably commanding position after winning the toss yesterday and tucking in against the discombublated New Zealanders. Marnus Labuschagne will walk out on 130 - his fourth ton in five Tests - with Matt Wade looking to go big by his side, scampering to 22 from 30 balls last night before the close. This could get huge and quick.</p> <p>The best the Black Caps can do is dry up the scoring, as they were able to with some success on the second morning at Perth and Melbourne. Despite the misadventure this tour has been, they have broadly kept their act together with the ball - especially Neil Wagner. Not much more can be asked of the southpaw. </p> <p>Right, I\u2019ll leave it there for the moment. As I said off the top, this is going to be a terrible day and there\u2019s no avoiding it.

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s the day two stumps report, where as JP says despite the NZ fightback, there was only ever one man in the headlines: New Zealand\u2019s day. First, an improved bowling and fielding performance was rewarded with figures of 7/171 for the day, then Toms Latham and Blundell saw off the new ball to hit the sheds with an unbeaten opening partnership. However, it remains Australia\u2019s Test match. A first-innings total of 454 is not to be sniffed at anywhere in the world, let alone on an SCG pitch showing variable bounce worryingly early in the match. That Australia are in the box seat is down almost single-handedly to Marnus Labuschagne. He plundered his maiden double-century in a superb display of concentration and accumulation. Around him batsmen came and went, and the tail refused to wag, making his 215 all the more valuable and impressive. New Zealand\u2019s makeshift attack stuck to its task well and in Todd Astle they\u2019ve found a leg-spinner worth persevering with. His googly in particular caused Australia plenty of trouble. Another strong day from the Kiwis tomorrow will set this match up nicely for a rare exciting finish. To find out if the Black Caps can back up their good work join me and Adam Collins right here for all the action. 28th over: New Zealand 63-0 (Latham 26, Blundell 34) Lyon with the final over of the day, and New Zealand survive it. 27th over: New Zealand 62-0 (Latham 25, Blundell 34) Labuschagne gets one over before the close to unfurl his leggies. Oooh, he starts with a long-hop that Latham absolutely hammers into the grille of Wade at short-leg. Gee, that was nasty. In another era that would have had major consequences. As it is, a replacement helmet is brought out and the nuggety Tasmanian gets on with his work. The rest of the over is awkward for New Zealand with Labuschagne getting plenty of purchase off the surface. He probably should have been given a longer spell much earlier. 26th over: New Zealand 61-0 (Latham 24, Blundell 34) Lyon does belatedly get another spell but Blundell has put his cue in the rack and safely dead-bats a maiden over. 25th over: New Zealand 61-0 (Latham 24, Blundell 34) Another Starc over that raises little alarm for the Black Caps. It feels like the desire to find reverse swing has diverted Australia away from their best chance of taking a wicket this evening - spin. 24th over: New Zealand 60-0 (Latham 24, Blundell 33) Shot of the innings so far, Blundell feasting on some length from Cummins and crunching a cover drive through the shadows that are lengthening across the SCG and away for four. 23rd over: New Zealand 55-0 (Latham 24, Blundell 28) Starc has now moved around the wicket to Blundell, searching for the exact strategy to maximise any available reverse swing. After two duds he finds his range, angling the ball in and then moving it late away from the bat but the right-hander is alert and jams a thick edge away through gully. However, that\u2019s the only delivery of note in another humdrum over from the below-par speedster. Just five overs left in the day. Can New Zealand finally walk off an Australia pitch with their heads held high? 23rd over: New Zealand 52-0 (Latham 24, Blundell 25) Cummins continues his probing spell and again troubles Blundell, beating the bat with one that zipped more than the Kiwi expected from a length. Australia\u2019s most consistent bowler has gone for just 13 from his eight overs. 22nd over: New Zealand 51-0 (Latham 24, Blundell 24) Starc is back in the attack for his second spell of the day, and he\u2019s hiding the ball in his run-up suggesting Australia think the ball is starting to reverse. It was hard to detect anything with the naked eye, and Starc\u2019s radar was again found wanting in an innocuous over that goes for two. 21st over: New Zealand 49-0 (Latham 22, Blundell 24) Blundell follows up his opening delivery tease with a solid troll, twice edging Cummins wide of the solitary slip for boundaries. Ricky Ponting and James Brayshaw are adamant the third umpire has missed a hot spot during his deliberations. There is a very faint mark on Blundell\u2019s bat after the ball passes; enough to overturn the on-field umpire? It would be a harsh call, especially with snicko not offering a murmur. NOT OUT! There was definitely a snicky noise in real time, but there\u2019s nothing on hot spot or RTS to overturn Aleem Dar\u2019s on-field call. Tim Paine\u2019s DRS disappointment continues. REVIEW! Blundell swished and missed a Cummins delivery outside off. Or did he? Paine is adamant there was an edge, so he makes the T signal. 20th over: New Zealand 41-0 (Latham 22, Blundell 16) Blundell is accepting the risk-reward of playing back to Lyon, swiping a short ball across the line for two that barely bounced above shin height. He repeats the shot the following ball but only earns himself a single for his troubles. Is it just me, or is Channel Seven\u2019s coverage beginning to edge disappointingly towards Nine\u2019s lamentable offering? 19th over: New Zealand 38-0 (Latham 22, Blundell 13) Blundell takes on a Cummins bumper and pulls it away well enough for a single, but it was an unconvincing stroke. The seamers haven\u2019t looked overly threatening with the new ball, especially compared to Nathan Lyon. I wonder if we\u2019ll see Labuschagne\u2019s leggies before the close? 18th over: New Zealand 37-0 (Latham 22, Blundell 12) Blundell gets off strike early with a three, giving Lyon a rare look at Latham. The rough patches on the pitch are less of a target to the left-hander and the Kiwi skipper is nimble on his feet snuffing out any other gremlins that might be lurking. 17th over: New Zealand 34-0 (Latham 22, Blundell 9) Cummins replaces the below-par Pattinson from the Paddington end. There is noticeably just the one slip for the no.1 ranked Test bowler, in the 17th over of a match where he has 400+ runs in his favour. That\u2019s a clear indication of how Australia see this pitch behaving. 16th over: New Zealand 33-0 (Latham 22, Blundell 8) Another big shout from Lyon against Blundell. Same line and length as previous overs but this one shoots low and under the defensive prod, inviting an LBW appeal. Erasmus is unmoved and DRS proves him right for judging the batsman to be struck outside the line of off stump. Blundell is now stuck between a rock and a hard place. He can\u2019t go back because of the uneven bounce and he\u2019s nervous about propping forward because of the bat-pad fielders on either side of the wicket. 15th over: New Zealand 30-0 (Latham 22, Blundell 7) Pattinson is pushing the ball full in his opening spell but there\u2019s no sideways movement in the air, allowing Latham in particular to get in position early and hit through the line of the ball. He collects a couple through cover using that method, although had he a less closed grip it would probably have been a boundary. The final drinks break of the day is being taken. 15 overs left to be bowled. 14th over: New Zealand 28-0 (Latham 20, Blundell 7) Lyon has settled into a groove spinning the ball into the right-handed Blundell from well outside off stump. The batsman is responding by getting back and across and dead-batting everything from well in his crease. Paine responds by bringing in catchers under Blundell\u2019s nose on either side of the wicket. Terrific Test match cricket. On the subject of the Air Quality Index (AQI) that may lead to a suspension of play, you can follow the reading in real-time at the link below. 13th over: New Zealand 28-0 (Latham 20, Blundell 7) New Zealand\u2019s opening pair look reasonably well set now. It\u2019s far from straightforward for them out in the middle, but they are applying themselves well. Pattinson\u2019s latest over contains three scoring deliveries with Latham looking to attack anything too full and straight. 12th over: New Zealand 24-0 (Latham 17, Blundell 6) There\u2019s something to pay attention to every Lyon delivery with the subtle natural variations on offer in this pitch. Latham escapes strike early before Blundell is canny in defence, watching the ball right onto the face of his bat, and then capitalising on some rare width to drive handsomely for his first boundary. He\u2019s given a warning at the conclusion of the over when he elects to leave a delivery that spins into his pads from well outside off stump. Lyon demands an LBW but Marais Erasmus is unconvinced. Paine rejects DRS which shows an umpire\u2019s call for height. 11th over: New Zealand 19-0 (Latham 16, Blundell 2) Pattinson moves around the wicket to Latham and the change almost works immediately with some extra bounce inviting the batsman to play away from his body and sending an unconvincing push a fraction wide of gully and away for four. That could easily have been out. The following ball New Zealand scamper a tight bye to rotate strike for the first time this innings! The TV commentators have introduced the talking point of matches being suspended for poor air quality. We\u2019re a while off that here, but the haze is thickening. 10th over: New Zealand 14-0 (Latham 12, Blundell 2) Double change for Australia with Nathan Lyon coming on from the Randwick Road end, and I like this change a lot. Todd Astle found plenty of turn and bounce earlier in the day, and with the inconsistent bounce on offer from this end the GOAT could be a handful. His spell begins with sharp turn from outside off into the right-handed Blundell, but his first three deliveries all stay lower than expected, making playing back perilous in the extreme. New Zealand are comfortable seeing off consecutive maidens. 9th over: New Zealand 14-0 (Latham 12, Blundell 2) Pattinson finally gets his chance from the Paddington end, replacing the lacklustre Starc. His line of attack is over the wicket, angling across the left-handed Latham, but the batsman is watchful and happy to allow a maiden to pass outside his off stump. That wind change that arrived a few overs ago has brought with it some smoke haze. Not anywhere near as bad as feared but another reminder of the context in which this match is being played. 8th over: New Zealand 14-0 (Latham 12, Blundell 2) There has been no strike rotation so far this innings which means it\u2019s either been Starc v Latham (advantage New Zealand) or Cummins v Blundell (advantage Australia). Blundell begins to even the ledger with his first runs - a pulled two - after 21 previous deliveries without troubling the scorers. Since those early scares the pitch has not misbehaved. 7th over: New Zealand 12-0 (Latham 12, Blundell 0) Starc retains his place in Australia\u2019s attack but it\u2019s another poor over. His second delivery in particular is too full and straight, allowing Latham to stroke a classical on-drive for the first boundary of the innings. 6th over: New Zealand 8-0 (Latham 8, Blundell 0) For five balls Cummins is much fuller and straighter, demonstrating his ability to respond to the conditions. Blundell is suitably orthodox in defence. Then ball six is a nasty short ball that the batsman tries to pull and suffers a winding blow for his troubles. Blundell is yet to score despite facing 18 deliveries. He is at the wrong end. 5th over: New Zealand 8-0 (Latham 8, Blundell 0) Starc will be lucky to get a fourth over with Pattinson waiting in the wings. His line and length have lacked precision so far and Latham collects a couple more twos in between simple leaves to keep New Zealand moving. 4th over: New Zealand 4-0 (Latham 4, Blundell 0) Cummins is a fraction too short and wide to Blundell this over to find that patch of unpredictable bounce. He does get one to jag back off the seam but it doesn\u2019t draw a shot from the MCG centurion. 3rd over: New Zealand 4-0 (Latham 4, Blundell 0) The deck is behaving much more predictably from the Randwick Road end where Starc is operating. Latham again works a couple into the leg-side in an over that passes without much fanfare. There\u2019s been a distinct change in the weather during the past few minutes. The flags on the grandstands are blowing hard, the bails are rattling in their grooves, and everyone is reminded - in case they\u2019d forgotten - of the perilous conditions elsewhere in the country. It remains stinking hot at the SCG. Meanwhile, the TV coverage shows that between innings New Zealand opted only for the light roller, not the heavy one, which has Ricky Ponting and others mystified. 2nd over: New Zealand 2-0 (Latham 2, Blundell 0) Pat Cummins shares the new ball from the Paddington end and his opening delivery keeps alarmingly low, shooting under Blundell\u2019s bat outside off stump. The second does the exact opposite! Wow! From a very similar line and length this one rears up with steepling bounce and smashes into Blundell\u2019s right arm as he props forward and attempts to leave. Only 150 overs into the Test that is a worrying sign for the quality of this deck. The inability to trust the bounce keeps Blundell pinned to his crease, and that almost accounts for him when a big off-cutter almost chops him in half. 1st over: New Zealand 2-0 (Latham 2, Blundell 0) Mitchell Starc\u2019s opening couple of deliveries lack fizz and Latham is grateful, nurdling a couple into the on-side to get off the mark. Ball three is bang on the money and finds the shoulder of the bat but doesn\u2019t carry all the way to a diving David Warner at third slip. The remainder of the over is off target. There\u2019ll be 28 more overs this session. The players are back out in the middle, Toms Latham and Blundell for New Zealand, preparing to get their first-innings underway. \u201cFollowing Jason Gillespie\u2019s comments welcoming Labuschagne to the 200 Club (Over 148),\u201d emails Mike Gibbs-Harris, \u201cdo you think Marnus will be dropped by Australia as Gillespie was after his 201 (not out)?\u201d Ha! As weird as that sounds, it\u2019s not out of the question. Australia\u2019s next Test assignment isn\u2019t for half a year, and a lot can happen in that time. There will be an enormous amount of ODI and T20i cricket in the coming months, so who knows where Labuschagne\u2019s game will be at come June/July? He may be miles off his game by then, or selectors may deem the tour an opportunity to rest their star man for more high-profile contests? Australia will be satisfied with 454, especially on a surface that is showing signs of wear and tear, but at various times over the past couple of days they looked on course for a much bigger total. That they got that much owes an awful lot to Marnus Labuschagne\u2019s diligent 215. That they didn\u2019t streak out of sight is testament to New Zealand\u2019s persistence, especially today, when plans were executed with greater skill, while the intensity around the ground was heightened. The last five wickets fell for just 44 runs, which will irritate Justin Langer. Wagner and de Grandhomme both ended with three wickets while Astle bowled well for his two. Henry and Somerville also delivered excellent wicket-taking deliveries. That\u2019ll do it. Wagner charges in, hits the deck, and Starc plays all around a straight one, not even bothering to turn around and survey the wreckage of his shattered timbers. That dismissal also brings TEA. 150th over: Australia 455-9 (Starc 22, Lyon 6) Starc was always going to long-handle Astle eventually, and when he did he almost perished. The ball went high out to long-on but Kyle Jamieson couldn\u2019t hold on to the difficult chance running in and diving forward. Of course, Starc repeats the shot, but with much better timing, clearing the fence over cow corner. 149th over: Australia 445-9 (Starc 13, Lyon 6) The pitch is increasingly misbehaving. Wagner\u2019s short balls are just dying in the wicket while Astle\u2019s googlies and gripping and spitting. A delivery Wagner would normally expect to target Lyon\u2019s badge almost bowled the No.11 mid-over such was the lack of bounce. The partnership continues - and so does the session - tea delayed until Australia are all out. A bit more context to Labuschagne\u2019s place in cricketing history, while his average is currently the best since Bradman. 148th over: Australia 444-9 (Starc 12, Lyon 6) Astle is on the wrong end of some ropey old fielding as Starc and Lyon sweep their way to a few handy last-wicket runs. Never. Gets. Old. 147th over: Australia 439-9 (Starc 8, Lyon 5) Starc is through a pull shot way too early so Wagner\u2019s bouncer thuds into his upper back while he\u2019s mid-follow through. He times the next bumper much better and rotates the strike, but then Lyon does almost exactly the same! Too quick on the pull and that ball will leave a nice welt on the spinner\u2019s ribcage up near his right armpit. 146th over: Australia 438-9 (Starc 7, Lyon 5) Starc gets off strike early, allowing Astle time to work Lyon over. Spinner almost gets spinner with a googly that\u2019s edged just wide of short-leg, then a sweep onto pad bobbles a fraction short of the diving Watling. Lyon and Starc then exchange singles to keep New Zealand waiting. 145th over: Australia 435-9 (Starc 5, Lyon 4) New Zealand have taken 4/26 in the last nine overs, bringing Australia back towards them after the hosts threatened once again to sprint miles out of sight. Wagner can\u2019t finish things off despite Lyon and Starc both swinging and missing like barn doors in a gale. 144th over: Australia 434-9 (Starc 4, Lyon 4) Lyon, like Starc before him, opens his account with four first ball, slog-sweeping Astle to square-leg. Oh boy, this is a proper collapse from Australia, serving only to reinforce the quality of Labuschagne\u2019s batting and the patience of Smith\u2019s 60-odd. Cummins is the latest to go, propping forward and turning Astle straight to Phillips at short-leg. It was a very sharp catch from the fielder - ordinarily a wicket-keeper. 143rd over: Australia 430-8 ( Cummins 8, Starc 4) Starc, long handle, four. No need for a sighter. Fun and games for a little while now you\u2019d think. Wagner, sniffing some tail-end scalps, comes back into the attack. Cummins gets an easy single which brings the ill-at-ease Pattinson onto strike. He repels a couple of length deliveries then makes an absolute horlicks of his first bumper. The ball doesn\u2019t get up but the Victorian ducks into it anyway. From there the ball somehow cannons off forearm, onto the back of the bat, then down towards the stumps. At first glance it\u2019s hard to tell if Pattinson then dislodges the bails with his bat in an attempt to deflect the ball away, or whether the ball itself finishes the job. Either way, Wagner has a wicket. Update: the ball did the business, not the toe of Pattinson\u2019s bat. 142nd over: Australia 425-7 (Pattinson 2, Cummins 7) Cummins works Astle around the corner for two, then drills him into the covers for a single. Pattinson is far less happy, and he is fortunate to escape a ripping bouncing googly that is paddled ungainly into the on-side. Pattinson is two from 18 and does not look switched on at the crease whatsoever. A little better than Stuart Broad v Kagiso Rabada, but not a lot. 141st over: Australia 422-7 (Pattinson 2, Cummins 4) Someville replaces CdG and he concedes only a couple of leg-byes to Pattinson, who is circumspect early in his innings. 140th over: Australia 420-7 (Pattinson 2, Cummins 4) Astle has bowled well today and New Zealand have stuck to their task with more intensity than on day one. Australia still miles ahead in the game, but if the Kiwis can mop up the tail we might at least have something approaching a contest on Monday and Tuesday. The first ball of Astle\u2019s over is a massive spinning and bouncing googly that deceives Labuschagne. The batsman responds by using his feet to reach the pitch of the next delivery, but once there all he can do is drive it straight back to the bowler who clings onto a smart return catch over his head. Labuschagne\u2019s stunning innings comes to an end. The New Zealanders applaud Australia\u2019s No.3 off the field. The crowd stands to applaud one of great SCG knocks. 139th over: Australia 416-6 (Labuschagne 215, Pattinson 2) Another tidy stump-to-stump over from de Grandhomme, stalling Australia\u2019s slogathon for the time being. Meanwhile, I\u2019m still in early 90s hip-hop earworm territory, only this time I\u2019m down with CdG - the man with three. 138th over: Australia 413-6 (Labuschagne 213, Pattinson 1) Nice over from Astle, especially to the left-handed Pattinson, whose lack of foot movement allows the ball chance to drift and spin. Australia still manage three singles to keep the scoreboard ticking over. As his white ball figures attest, CdG is not the easiest to get away in a hurry. Labuschagne dots a couple before rotating strike, then Paine dots a couple before being bowled! Lovely delivery from CdG, hitting a perfect line and length, finding a touch of seam back into the right-hander - who left his gate open trying to force a late cut - and the ball cannoned into the top of off. 137th over: Australia 410-6 (Labuschagne 210) 136th over: Australia 409-5 (Labuschagne 210, Paine 35) The tonk is on. Paine gets off strike then Labuschagne slogs Astle with a crooked bat and only just avoids mid-on with a mistimed stroke. A couple more arrive courtesy of a dab to third-man before Astle beats the bat for no reward. Question: Is there anybody in cricket you\u2019re happier to see succeed than Tim Paine? Jason Holder perhaps? Kane Williamson? The entire Ireland team? 135th over: Australia 403-5 (Labuschagne 205, Paine 34) Milestone passed, Labuschagne shows his hand, cutting for two then driving aggressively but straight to the field. I reckon we could be in for some #Declarationspeculation hitting over the next couple of hours. CdG is handed the ball as the field squeezes the life out of the SCG. Normally a vast football oval it must feel as enclosed as solitary confinement for Labuschagne right now. Dot. Dot. Edge! But there\u2019s no slip - and the ball scoots down tot he boundary for four runs - 400 up for Australia - and a magnificent double century for Australia\u2019s superstar no.3 134th over: Australia 397-5 (Labuschagne 199, Paine 34) Astle sends down five dots in the over after drinks. The crowd holds its breath for ball six. Paine cuts. Groans spread. But they grow into cheers as the ball runs and runs away to the third-man boundary for four! Labuschagne on strike to start the next over. Surely 200 is his, 19 minutes after hitting 199. Just to annoy you all with a little earworm, I can\u2019t get Cypress Hill\u2019s Insane in the Brain out of my head while Paine and Labuschagne are out in the middle together. Thank you very much Adam. Remember to retune your emails and tweets to the following addresses: @JPHowcroft and jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com. 133rd over: Australia 393-5 (Labuschagne 199, Paine 30) The SCG crowd are a bit tetchy with Paine finding it ever so hard to put Marnus back down there. He will get one delivery, with Paine pushing one to cover. And he plays and misses at it! That was a lovely bit of bowling. That\u2019s drinks as well. Over to JP Howcroft to, let\u2019s hope, drag Marnus Labuschagne over the line for a maiden double ton. Bye! Oh, before I go: great news from the Russell Jackson bat auction for bushfire relief: it has topped two grand! Get in there! To be honest, I still think that\u2019s a bargain. It couldn\u2019t be easier to lodge your bid. Check out the below and up the offer. Do it! 132nd over: Australia 392-5 (Labuschagne 199, Paine 29) Toddy, my man. Can you do to Marnus what happened to Matty Elliott all those years ago? Or Steve Smith at Sahina Park? I was calling the latter for West Indies radio, a DRS review sorting him out. Let\u2019s hope not. He\u2019s earned this achievement. Paine isn\u2019t finding it easy to give the strike back to him though... until the final ball, that is! Paine to face again. 131st over: Australia 391-5 (Labuschagne 199, Paine 28) Henry has the job to do with the entire SCG crowd waiting to see a special moment. Paine does his bit, giving Labuschagne the strike with three balls remaining in the over. On 199, he defends the first, defends the second... and... defends the third! Over bowled. 130th over: Australia 390-5 (Labuschagne 199, Paine 27) Hot Toddy Astle is brought back on and is making life tough for Labuschagne with a delivery that turns a long way to beat the edge. Now on 198, he cuts to extra cover from the penultimate delivery, Paine then doing likewise to keep the strike. We wait. 129th over: Australia 386-5 (Labuschagne 197, Paine 25) Labuschagne pulls Henry but only for one. Paine wants to cut when he gets his turn but underestimates the bounce, beaten outside the line. He responds with a much better shot for three out to cover from the balls of his feet. Labuschagne once more, now a boundary away, but takes a quick single instead to midwicket. He\u2019ll wait for next over. 128th over: Australia 381-5 (Labuschagne 195, Paine 22) Paine picks Somerville off for a single through midwicket after using his feet to get to the pitch. He has a nice start here. The offie is back around the wicket to Labuschagne, who is jumping down the track to defend then doing the same to attack, driving on the up through cover. What a shot that is, all the way along the ground and straight from the middle of the bat. And now another gallop down the strip before setting for one to square leg. He brought up his ton in Perth with a six (and tried to in Adelaide), so that\u2019s worth keeping an eye on now that\u2019s he\u2019s within five of his double century. 127th over: Australia 375-5 (Labuschagne 190, Paine 21) Fair play to Matt Henry, who keeps hitting his length just on the fourth stump line over and over and over again. Remember, he\u2019s doing this with a broken thumb, which must be throbbing as he sets in to deliver each ball. His maiden to Labuschagne is spot on here. 126th over: Australia 375-5 (Labuschagne 190, Paine 21) Somerville gives Paine enough room to cut his first ball, away for a couple and into the 20s. He\u2019s kept honest by the Kiwi spinner for the rest of the over, who has bowled pretty well. 125th over: Australia 373-5 (Labuschagne 190, Paine 19) There we go, Labuschagne overtakes his 185 from Brisbane against Pakistan in November with a boundary to start Henry\u2019s over, albeit an unconvincing one off an outside edge through the cordon. But with only one catcher in there, the risk is limited. By the end of the set he\u2019s into the 190s from the bottom edge of his bat, mishitting his pull shot. It came up on social media during the lunch break that he\u2019s never made it to 200 in any form of cricket that is registered on the world wide web. What better time! 124th over: Australia 367-5 (Labuschagne 185, Paine 18) Labuschagne pulls level with his highest score with a push to mid-on. He\u2019s got a long way to go, I reckon. 123rd over: Australia 365-5 (Labuschagne 184, Paine 18) Wagner to Labuschange to begin, the Queenslander taking a single first ball this time. Full, full, short is the pattern this time to the captain, who is happy to have a pop at the pull shot, getting it straight to ground and out to a sweeper. He was the player who changed the tempo of the innings last week at Melbourne when Wagner was in the heads of Australia\u2019s middle order. Another half-century to finish his summer would do the world of good before white-ball cricket takes over until Bangladesh in June. 122nd over: Australia 363-5 (Labuschagne 183, Paine 17) Paine gives the strike straight to Labuschagne from the first ball of Somerville\u2019s new set. The dominant No3 plays the rest with a straight bat, easing one down the ground to finish. 121st over: Australia 361-5 (Labuschagne 182, Paine 16) Wagner again to Paine, who is more conversative this time around, prompting a move to around the wicket for the tail-end of the over. He takes one from a fuller ball, Labuschagne dealing with an accurate short one with soft hands to finish. 120th over: Australia 360-5 (Labuschagne 182, Paine 15) Somerville from the Paddington End, where he started the day so successfully with Wade\u2019s wicket. The TV cuts to a shot of the city, just a couple of kilometres away from the SCG, and the haze is thick. I wonder at what stage they will start considering their options in terms of taking the players off? It looks very sunny in the middle but they are measuring this on air quality. Anyway, in the here and now, the big off-spinner gets one to keep low at the home skipper, just getting his bat down in time. You don\u2019t normally see that in the opening innings of a Test. Paine goes at the next ball, a full delivery outside the off-stump, middling a square drive out to the rope. He\u2019s hitting them well in this series, helping silence calls for his replacement. 119th over: Australia 354-5 (Labuschagne 181, Paine 10) From the Randwick End, Wagner has the field spread out on the legside and just Taylor in the conventional cordon, as is the norm at this stage of an innings for the left-armer. Ooh, and Paine has a pop at the short one too, missing with his swing. He\u2019s back in defence straight after that then leaving the last couple. They\u2019ll go harder in this session. The players are back on the field. Wagner is back into the attack for yet another spell, this his 27th over. Paine is up the business end. PLAY! \u201cMorning Adam (well it\u2019s morning in Perth).\u201d Hello, John Phaceas. \u201cIt strikes me that many of those players in favour of 4 day tests have limited experience in actually playing on day 5. Regardless, though most tests currently only last 4 days anyway, my fear would be that officially shortening the duration would result in a lot more teams pulling down the shutters early and holding on for draws. How many wins currently come down to a team being 3 down in the 4th innings at the start of day 4 and staring at the mountain of surviving 180 overs or scoring 400 runs? Plus \u2013 5 day tests are a Tex Perkins-like gesture to the banality of broadcasting/advertising executives who increasingly call the shots in all modern sport.\u201d Also, a lot of assumptions about how many overs would fit into a day. With the exception of New Zealand, is there a team that consistently gets through their 90? Let alone another eight, even with an additional half an hour. It won\u2019t happen. Another Marnus nugget \u201cIs anyone else struggling with guilt over checking/listening/watching the cricket?\u201d I\u2019m asked by @Roscommon_Cat on twitter. \u201cI\u2019m on the other side of the state to where the fires are, but I feel like it\u2019s somehow in bad taste.\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong at all to feel that way. But I suppose the nature of life is that it continues through tragedy all the time and this is no different. To be fair to the participants in this match, they are trying to use the week to raise much-needed funds. Without the fixture taking place, it would be harder to achieve that. To that end, a reminder that you can participate in a couple of cricket-related auctions for bushfire relief. Take a look at these playing shirts for the Australian team, and Russell Jackson\u2019s magnificent cricket bat - currently at $1500. Bargain! New Zealand hung in there. Across the 28 overs, they took two wickets and only gave up 71 runs, which wasn\u2019t a bad effort. That Somerville bowled Wade sweeping in the first over of the morning halted any thoughts of putting the foot down, Head tied up for half an hour before falling caught behind to Henry - the other scalp. The problem for the Black Caps is that Labuschagne goes on and on, now just four runs short of his highest Test score and 19 away from a maiden double ton; he\u2019s been out there for 308 deliveries but his concentration can\u2019t be broken. This really is the definition of a golden summer. Remember to email or tweet me your thoughts on four-day Test cricket. We\u2019ll pick that up shortly. 118th over: Australia 354-5 (Labuschagne 181, Paine 10) de Grandhomme has the final over before the break, Paine taking the third ball - another hoopy inswinger - out to backward square to get off strike. He\u2019s where he needs to be at Labuschagne too, finding the inside edge one last time before they depart for LUNCH! 117th over: Australia 353-5 (Labuschagne 181, Paine 9) They are scoring easily enough off Great Guy Todd Astle, but he has a decent wrong\u2019un on him! He nearly slips one past Paine, in what will be his final over before lunch. The captain keeps the strike with a single out to point. I\u2019ll be calling this fashion option the Hot Toddy. Please do it. 116th over: Australia 349-5 (Labuschagne 180, Paine 6) It doesn\u2019t look pretty this field for CdG but you have to change it up when an innings has been going this long, nearing an interval. Watling makes a lovely take down the legside, quickly whipping the bails off - he appeals but Paine never moves his back foot. The all-rounder brings out his outswinger next, locating the outside of Paine\u2019s bat, steered behind point. Warne and Gilchrist are talking about average speeds for legspinners as they look at Astle, who is sending them down at about 85kph. The best there is reflects on Stuart Macgill: \u201cGood bowler. Gave it a rip.\u201d Love that stuff. 115th over: Australia 346-5 (Labuschagne 178, Paine 5) \u201cYeah, one!\u201d calls Labuschagne when taking a single through point to retain the strike at the end of the Astle over... he now even sounds like Steve Smith. All told, five risk-free runs from it, the Queenslander closing in on 185 - his highest Test score. 114th over: Australia 341-5 (Labuschagne 174, Paine 4) de Grandhomme, who opened the bowling yesterday, is on for his first go today. To Labuschagne, he has no conventional slips but Ross Taylor is in position at leg slip, with Latham up to the stumps. A bit different but the all-rounder makes it work for him, all stump-to-stump. He also finds the inside edge with a tidy inswinger. Useful first set. 113th over: Australia 340-5 (Labuschagne 173, Paine 4) After getting through that appeal, Paine makes contact with the middle of his bat a few times in the over while defending before putting away a half-tracker past point to get off the mark. NOT OUT! Yeah, that\u2019s not a good review. The noise that Watling detected before the ball hit the bat was the blade hitting the pad. They have no reviews left. Watling smiles upon realising that, on reflection, it really wasn\u2019t much of a shout. HAS ASTLE TRAPPED PAINE LBW? Aleem Dar says no but Tom Latham is sending it upstairs. Stand by. 112th over: Australia 336-5 (Labuschagne 173, Paine 0) Watling is very keen on a leg before shout to start Henry\u2019s over, Labuschagne shuffling across his stumps and working it down to fine leg, hitting pad before pat. No review. He defends the rest of another accurate over. It\u2019s been a very good spell. As we move towards lunch, give me your hottest takes on four-day Tests. I\u2019ve already said that I can\u2019t have it. Not full-time. I don\u2019t mind them being used to enable Tests that wouldn\u2019t otherwise happen, but to make them compulsory for the next round of the World Test Championship is a whole other thing. Go! 111th over: Australia 334-5 (Labuschagne 171, Paine 0) My man, Todd Astle! Welcome to the attack! The leggie has added a face-full of sunscreen to his balding head, sunglasses and bouncy action. He finds Labuschagne\u2019s edge too, albeit played with soft hands. Down the track, the Queenslander clips two to keep the scoreboard going in his direction, taking another that way before the over is done. 110th over: Australia 331-5 (Labuschagne 168, Paine 0) Henry staight on the mark to Paine, now back over the wicket after winning the Head wicket angling in from around. From a selfish perspective, Labuschagne needs his captain to go with him here in order to make sure that he can advance to 200 and beyond. To finish the successful over, Henry finds Paine\u2019s inside edge for a second time. Excellent and gutsy bowling from a man who is racing in with a broken thumb. Well bowled Matt Henry! He earned Head\u2019s edge there after such a consistent spell, the South Australian trying to get his first run for half an hour with a cut too close to his body, taken comfortably by Watling behind the wicket. 109th over: Australia 331-4 (Labuschagne 168, Head 10) Glorious from Labuschagne when dancing at Somerville, lifting him straight back over his head after getting to the pitch of the delivery. The special part was in the control, checking the shot so to get the desired result while eliminating risk. He\u2019s so good. 108th over: Australia 327-4 (Labuschagne 164, Head 10) Henry doesn\u2019t come close to penetrating the Labuschagne forward defensive for the first half of the over so he changes to around the wicket. It makes no difference. The pitch map shows that the bowler did nothing wrong, hitting a very consistent line and length, but there\u2019s no exposure for the No3 here. He has some huge numbers ahead of him. 107th over: Australia 326-4 (Labuschagne 163, Head 10) Labuschagne won\u2019t let the morning drift, rocking back this time to cut Somerville for two before coming forward to flick him wide of mid-on for another single. This reminds me a bit of Warner in Adelaide. He won\u2019t have the time to do what the opener did there but there\u2019s the same punishing accumulation, defined by rapid running. Superstar. 106th over: Australia 323-4 (Labuschagne 160, Head 10) Right, we\u2019re back from a long drinks interval, understandably so given it is over 33 degrees already in Sydney and only getting hotter. Just the one run added here, via Labuschagne off his pads. Jeet Raval is back on the field. After an hour off the park, there he is. ... or the OBO! 105th over: Australia 322-4 (Labuschagne 159, Head 10) Somerville completes the first hour. Operating again from around the wicket he has Marnus missing a sweep to begin, prompting a half-appeal for leg before. He\u2019s deeper in the crease later in the over, pulling two, before pushing another single into that gap. Head deals with the rest. Only 33 runs in the hour with a wicket, to New Zealand\u2019s credit. But to seriously give themselves a chance of avoiding a day in the dirt they need Labuschagne right away or there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019ll still be going at tea. 104th over: Australia 319-4 (Labuschagne 156, Head 10) Henry to Head, driving nicely along the carpet without risk to start, adding three. Labuschagne resets after launching at Somerville in the previous over, playing the seamer conservatively. He keeps the strike with one into the covers. More good batting. Fulton, of course, is one of many sportsmen who have been dubbed Two Metre Peter. Think Crouch, Street, George, Wright. I\u2019m sure there are others. 103rd over: Australia 315-4 (Labuschagne 155, Head 7) Up and over mid-off, Labuschagne takes Somerville from around the wicket, inside-out for four more. He\u2019s shifting up the gears now, picking his moments regardless of the delivery. Good grief, another illness for New Zealand. Jeet Raval, the opener unexpectedly recalled yesterday, is off the field with the flu. Peter Fulton, the 40-year-old former Black Caps batsman, has his whites on to field if required. What a mess. 102nd over: Australia 309-4 (Labuschagne 150, Head 6) Wish a push into the covers and a quick single, Marnus Labuschagne has made it to 150 for the third time this summer. Daddy Hundreds, he loves them. Earlier in the Henry over, into the attack for the first time today - bowling with a broken thumb - he played a delightful on-drive down to the boundary. His 14th boundary in a stay of 253 deliveries that shows no sign of ending soon. Surely he makes it a double ton. 101st over: Australia 304-4 (Labuschagne 145, Head 6) Somerville continues, Head waiting for a ball outside his leg stump before using his blade, taking one to midwicket. Labuschagne does likewise to finish, negating the turn and angle from round the wicket by using his feet to get to the pitch, flicking a further single. 100th over: Australia 302-4 (Labuschagne 144, Head 5) Another little milestone for Australia, moving beyond 300. It\u2019s been harder work than they might have expected this morning, losing Wade to begin, but a huge day still awaits. Sure enough, they didn\u2019t get there easily with Wagner bowling, angling into Labuschagne\u2019s inside edge for the third time in the last four overs. 99th over: Australia 298-4 (Labuschagne 140, Head 5) Labuschagne turns the strike over early in the over with a compact sweep before Head continues to leave everything he can outside the off-stump as he plays himself in. No rush here. That\u2019s one of the many reasons why I\u2019m well against the move for compulsory four-day Tests: there\u2019s something meaningful to be found in quiet spells. Anyway, I won\u2019t go on about it as this is all inevitable now that CA are banging the drum. 98th over: Australia 297-4 (Labuschagne 139, Head 5) Wagner finds Labuschagne\u2019s inside edge for a second time in this first half hour. It\u2019s now Head\u2019s turn to take a look at New Zealand\u2019s number one, leaving both the short and full stuff well alone. 97th over: Australia 296-4 (Labuschagne 138, Head 5) Shot! Head rocks back early at Somerville and has enough time to get on top of the bounce with a cut shot, racing away to the rope. Shot of the morning so far. He plays the rest carefully. 96th over: Australia 292-4 (Labuschagne 138, Head 1) Controlled accumulation from Labuschagne, easing Wagner through point for a couple with no bat swing at all - all timing. Oh, as soon as I type that he plays and misses at a delivery he had no need to play, well outside the off-stump and swinging further away. 95th over: Australia 290-4 (Labuschagne 136, Head 1) I wonder if Somerville was just coming on for an over to mix it up at the start but was kept on because of the wicket? Regardless, this is turning into a very useful spell. Head gets off strike early in the over with a push, using his feet - not without risk. Good flight. Labuschagne gives the strike straight back with a sweep - no issues there. He gets two more chances at the left-hander, who goes back then forward in defence. 94th over: Australia 288-4 (Labuschagne 135, Head 0) I mentioned off the top that New Zealand have done well to tie Australia up on the first morning of the second day at Perth and Melbourne. Wagner, on again here, doesn\u2019t give it up. This is another disciplined over to Labuschagne, giving him nothing short of a length before sending down a full inswinger, which the dominant Australian number three tried to drive but ended up playing off the inside edge into his ankle. Ouch. 93rd over: Australia 288-4 (Labuschagne 135, Head 0) A probing over from Somerville to the new man Head, including a big shout for lbw when his arm-ball goes on with the angle beyond the inside edge and into the pad. No review but good early signs for the tall spinner. What a great story him playing this week. 92nd over: Australia 288-4 (Labuschagne 135, Head 0) Wagner continues his spell with this second new ball from last night, sticking with his usual approach with the field spread on the legside and banging in from around the wicket. Labuschagne is taking a look, letting the left-armer come to him, defending solidly when he does. A gem from my press box colleague Tommy Decent, noting that Labuschagne\u2019s live batting average is now above Steve Smith\u2019s. Whoa! And here\u2019s that Wade dismissal from the previous over. Bowls him sweeping! Wade has thrown away a big chance there, having a crack at Somerville from around the wicket but missing the ball, crashing into off-stump. He\u2019s gone without adding to his overnight score. A lovely moment for the veteran tweaker, his name into the book on his old New South Wales home ground. 91st over: Australia 288-4 (Labuschagne 135) Earlier in the over, it only took three balls, Labuschagne dancing down the track and hammering Somerville over midwicket for four runs. Just as it was when he walked out yesterday, he\u2019s hitting the ball in the middle of the bat straight away. The players are on the field. Labuschagne bounces past the flags, leading Wade to the middle. \u201cIt looks like a good batting surface but it is definitely going to deteriorate,\u201d says Simon Katich on SEN radio. The offspinner, Will Somerville has the ball in his hand to start this second day to the man on 130. PLAY! How the track looks. Injury update from the Black Caps. Matt Henry broke his thumb yesterday when stopping a booming Joe Burns straight drive in his follow-through. Not fun. We\u2019ve been told that he will bowl but I\u2019d be surprised if they send him out to bat. More from Kevin Roberts. Let\u2019s cut to the chase: he wants four-day Test Matches. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remind yourself that Test cricket hasn\u2019t always been played over five days,\u201d and so on. He says there is no \u201cpre-ordained outcome\u201d to the work they are doing at the moment but we all know how this one is going to end. Sigh. Another excellent fundraising option is the auction being held by Russell Jackson, formerly of this parish. In addition to being a wonderful cricket writer, Russ is a great collector. He is putting one of his gems, a cricket bat signed by ten former Test captains, to auction. Bidding is up to $1200, which is a steal if you ask me. The process is straightforward, as he details here. Spread the word! Kevin Roberts, Cricket Australia\u2019s chief executive, is on SEN Radio. Off the top he says there are options being looked at for fundraising in addition to what has already been initiated with the playing shirt auction, which is building well. It sounds like they are open to hosting a charity game, which would be fantastic. Of course, there was one held at the MCG after the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami. Roberts also notes that the second half of today might be impacted by air quality, requiring the players to be taken off the field. He says that the match officials will be charged with the responsibility of making that decision, based on the measurements that are available. He adds that they did look at moving the date or venue of the Sydney Test but were comfortable at going ahead this week. If looking for something to listen to as we work towards the first ball, Geoff Lemon and I recorded a New Year\u2019s Eve ep of The Final Word. It includes a chat with Paul Sinclair from the Australian Conservation Foundation, various best/worst lists from an eventful 2019 and our 2015-2019 team of the WBBL. Morning everyone. Just as it was yesterday, there is a cloud hanging over this Test, and across the country, as Australia wakes up to a truly harrowing weather forecast for the day ahead. Of course, it is going to be impossible to concentrate entirely on the cricket as news comes in from Victoria and New South Wales, but I\u2019ll try my best to keep things as normal as possible on here, for what it\u2019s worth. When play does resume at the SCG it\u2019ll be with Australia in a predicably commanding position after winning the toss yesterday and tucking in against the discombublated New Zealanders. Marnus Labuschagne will walk out on 130 - his fourth ton in five Tests - with Matt Wade looking to go big by his side, scampering to 22 from 30 balls last night before the close. This could get huge and quick. The best the Black Caps can do is dry up the scoring, as they were able to with some success on the second morning at Perth and Melbourne. Despite the misadventure this tour has been, they have broadly kept their act together with the ball - especially Neil Wagner. Not much more can be asked of the southpaw. Right, I\u2019ll leave it there for the moment. As I said off the top, this is going to be a terrible day and there\u2019s no avoiding it. If you want to talk about that, the cricket or anything else, feel free to drop me a line or ping me a message on twitter.",

      "bodyText": "As they set out on a small landing craft, Nick Ritar could hardly see the mammoth, 180-metre-long HMAS Choules. The smoke was too thick. Days after Ritar, his partner, Kirsten Bradley, and their son, Ashar, hunkered down in a home as fires raged on the Victorian coastal town of Mallacoota, the Tasmanian family were among those rescued by the Australian navy. Speaking to Guardian Australia a few hours before the ship docked at Hastings, east of Melbourne, Ritar was still stunned by the scale of the crisis. \u201cYou look down upon these giant shipping containers on the main deck with red kangaroos on the side of them and big words emblazoned on them, Australian Aid,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia\u2019s had bushfires forever, but we\u2019ve never had to call in the navy to evacuate 1,000 people from a coastal town. That doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s hard to wrap your head around.\u201d Mallacoota, now only accessible by air and sea, has become a symbol of the unprecedented nature of the bushfire crisis. About 4,000 people, mostly holidaymakers, were forced to the foreshore as fires moved quickly towards the town. If the heat got too close, they were told, they would have to get in the water. On Saturday a red haze hung over the town once again, signifying that the fires terrorising other parts of the state might yet return to Mallacoota. In the lead-up to New Year\u2019s Eve, the fire threat had crept up on the holiday town, though it was not among those listed in a mass evacuation throughout eastern Victoria. As it became clear that the threat was increasing, Ritar\u2019s family moved from his in-laws\u2019 place to a family friend\u2019s house around the corner. At all times, Ritar said, one adult would stay in the safest room with a group of children. It was under a concrete slab and had no windows. The others set up a generator and watched for updates on their mobile phones. They also went out into the street to see which homes were still occupied, sealing properties that had been abandoned in a hurry. In between, they would pop back to the house for a coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of this strange mix of panic and boredom, waiting for the fires to come or the winds to change,\u201d Ritar said. By the morning of New Year\u2019s Eve, sirens rang out across the town. The sky turned black, then bright red. In the distance there was the sound of popping: gas bottles or cars exploding. \u201cThat\u2019s a scary sound when you can hear it getting closer and closer,\u201d Ritar said. They ventured out again. \u201cThis is when we could see the really big plumes of smoke coming towards us,\u201d he said. A house with cars parked around it caught fire less than 100 metres away. \u201cIt went off like a bomb. That was the probably the scariest moment.\u201d Country Fire Authority crews came in a truck and had almost extinguished the blaze when they ran out of water. They couldn\u2019t come back. \u201cThey had to go,\u201d said Ritar. \u201cThey obviously had bigger problems.\u201d Mallacoota did too. A wind change pushed the worst of the blazes west of the centre of the town but dozens of homes were destroyed in the fires. With all nearby roads closed, the town was completely isolated. Helicopters and police boats ferried in food and other supplies but reports of shortages emerged. Across several kilometres of beach at Bastion Point, dead birds sat in lines along the sand. Ritar listed those he saw: a kookaburra, then a magpie, then a barn owl, then a king parrot, then a New Holland honeyeater. \u201cThey would have been swept out into the clouds and then deposited in the ocean,\u201d he said. \u201cThen they\u2019d washed up on the shore as bits of charcoal and burnt leaves. One after the other, just asphyxiated by the fire. We must have walked a couple of kilometres along it before it just got too heartbreaking.\u201d On Wednesday the Victorian government confirmed it had called in the defence force, and the navy would send HMAS Choules and a number of smaller vessels to evacuate hundreds of people by sea. By Friday, Ritar and his family were gliding along the water towards the safety of a navy vessel normally deployed to assist in overseas humanitarian disasters. \u201cNormally, I think he would be pretty excited to see such a thing,\u201d Ritar said of Ashar, 10. On board, the mood reflected the varied experiences of those on board. \u201cThere\u2019s people here who have lost their homes, they\u2019ve evacuated because they literally no longer had a home,\u201d Ritar said. \u201cThere\u2019s other people who are backpackers from around the world. They\u2019re doing what young people do, meeting each other, playing cards and laughing and joking.\u201d The evacuees were transported to a disaster relief centre at the Melbourne convention centre on Saturday afternoon.",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to line the streets of Baghdad today for the funeral procession of Qassem Suleimani, the Iranian general killed in a US drone attack, writes our Middle East-based correspondent, Michael Safi. Suleimani will also be honoured with processions in the holy Shia cities of Karbala and Najaf on Saturday, Iranian officials said, before his remains are taken to Iran for a prayer ceremony in Tehran and a burial in his hometown. The funeral comes against a backdrop of extremely high tension in Baghdad where militais reported airstrikes on another convoy of vehicles on Saturday morning killed at least five people. The US has denied responsibility. We\u2019re closing the blog now but you read Michael\u2019s full report here. You can also read my colleague Mario Koran\u2019s summary of the tumultuous events of the last 24 hours here. Thanks for reading. The statement from the US-led coalition, which is in Iraq and Syria to fight Islamic State, was tweeted out by a spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve, Colonel Myles B Caggins. Both Iraq\u2019s umbrella grouping of Shia militias, the Popular Mobilisation Forces, and Iraqi state television said the airstrikes had taken place and that they were carried out by the US. The US-led coalition in Iraq says it did not carry out Saturday\u2019s airstrikes near Taj stadium in Baghdad that killed several people, a spokesman has said, according to Reuters. Hopefully we can expand on this soon. Reuters has some interesting background about what could have led to the killing of Suleimani. The news agency reports that in mid-October, the Revolutionary Guards general met Iraqi Shia militia allies \u201cat a villa on the banks of the Tigris river, looking across at the US embassy complex in Baghdad\u201d. At the meeting, Suleimani told his Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and other powerful militia leaders to step up attacks on US targets in the country using sophisticated new weapons provided by Iran, two militia commanders and two security sources briefed on the gathering told Reuters. The meeting came as anti-Iranian protests were gathering strength in Iraq and the reports claims Suleimani wanted to up the ante against the US in order to provoke a response and turn the Iraqi protests against Washington. This is the full report here. Lack of official confirmation about the latest strikes means we\u2019re feeling our way as to exactly what happened. Newsweek says it has been told by Pentagon officials that the attack was on the Imam Ali Brigades, an Iraqi Shia militia with ties to Iran. There was a \u201chigh probability\u201d that the strike resulted in the death of the brigades leader, Newsweek says, adding that it was a US operation. Another thing to note on the new strikes is that a US government source has said it wasn\u2019t an American operation. Associated Press, quoting an anonymous official, said it \u201cwas not an American military attack\u201d. It\u2019s only one anonymous source so we have to be cautious. Interesting though. Thanks to the US team. I\u2019m Martin Farrer taking over the blog. There is a little bit more information about the airstrikes carried out on targets in Iraq early on Saturday morning local time that reportedly killed five members of Iranian-backed militia near Taj stadium in Baghdad. Although there is no official confirmation of the details, Iraq\u2019s Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMUs) umbrella grouping of paramilitary groups have denied that senior leaders were killed. It says the vehicles were carrying medics. convoy of medics, not senior leaders as reported in some media, according to a statement reported by Reuters. The statement says: \u201cInitial sources confirm that the strike targeted a convoy of Popular Mobilisation Forces medics near Taji stadium in Baghdad.\u201d Reuters goes on to quote an Iraqi army source saying that six people were killed in the strikes \u2013 not five \u2013 and that three were critically wounded. That does it for the live blog here on the west coast, but before I sign off and hand over the wheel to my colleagues in Australia, let\u2019s take a look back at a very busy Friday. Here are some highlights from the afternoon. Earlier in the day Donald Trump defended the drone strike that killed Qassem Suleimani, Iran\u2019s top general, claiming in a short statement to have taken the action required to stop a war. On the contrary, Majid Takht Ravanchi, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations told CNN the US has started the war \u2014 and it can expect \u201charsh revenge.\u201d Meanwhile, the US is sending nearly 3,000 more army troops to the Middle East to squelch reprisals expected in the region. Late in the afternoon reports surfaced of a fresh US airstrike which is believed to have hit a pro-Iran group of soldiers north of Baghdad. Details have been slowly trickling out, but still unconfirmed are the identities of the deceased. And earlier in the afternoon Trump stumped at an Evangelical megachurch in Florida, where he lauded yesterday\u2019s airstrike and touted actions he couched as his efforts to protect religious freedoms and Evangelical values. Reporter Richard Luscombe was on the scene reporting from Miami. Finally, state department officials are trying to bolster claims from the president and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, that the killing of Suleimani stopped imminent attacks and was therefore an act of self-defence. \u201cThere were things he could do that nobody else could do,\u201d a US official said of Suleimani. \u201cHe was not a decentralized manager; he was a hands-on, down-to-the-details manager. And we are not safe in the region as long as Iran is pursuing this general strategy, but we are safer without him than we are with him.\u201d In newly aired interview, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, Majid Takht Ravanchi, said the US has already started a war by assassinating one of Iran\u2019s top generals and promised the country will exact \u201charsh revenge\u201d. \u201cWe cannot just close our eyes to what happened last night,\u201d the ambassador told CNN. \u201cDefinitely there will revenge. There will be harsh revenge...the time, the place, will be decided by Iran.\u201d US officials are already bracing for retaliatory action. \u201cThe Pentagon ordered 3,000 reinforcements to the region, diplomats were reportedly told to pack their bags in case of sudden evacuation, and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, called his counterparts around the world to try to persuade them the US was \u201ccommitted to de-escalation\u201d, the Guardian wrote earlier today. Read more here: Along with the California representative Ro Khanna, the Vermont senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders today announced legislation that would prohibit any funding for offensive military force in or against Iran without prior congressional approval. \u201cI am introducing a bill with Rep Khanna to stop Donald Trump from illegally taking us to war against Iran,\u201d Sanders wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s working-class kids who will have to fight and die in a disastrous new Middle East conflict \u2013 not the children of billionaires.\u201d In the wake of the strike that killed Iran\u2019s top general, and a more recent offensive that claimed the lives of five yet-to-be-identified members of an Iran-backed militia, law enforcement officials in several major US cities are advising residents to remain watchful for retaliation. Guardian reporter Edward Helmore observes that officials in New York and Los Angeles have yet to encounter credible threats, but are remaining vigilant against potential threats. \u201cYou see something, say something,\u201d the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, said on Twitter. Helmore noted: In November, a \u2018sleeper agent\u2019 of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese group listed by US authorities as a foreign terrorist organization, was sentenced to 40 years in prison by a federal court over plans to conduct terrorist attacks around New York. Prosecutors claimed that Ali Kourani was \u201crecruited, trained and deployed by Hezbollah\u2019s Islamic Jihad Organization\u201d and had spent \u201cyears conducting surveillance on the city\u2019s critical infrastructure, federal buildings, international airports, and even daycare centers\u201d. The Associated Press has reported new details on the latest airstrike in Iraq which it attributes to an Iraqi official who says the strike hit two cars and killed five members of the Iran-backed militia they were carrying. The unnamed official said the identities of those killed are unknown. The salvo comes a day after a US drone strike that killed top Iranian general Gen Qassem Suleimani \u2013 an act of aggression which Iran has promised to avenge. Early reports have emerged on a fresh airstrike that took place in Baghdad and the details in the past hour appeared increasingly credible. Reuters reports: \u201cAirstrikes targeting Iraq\u2019s Popular Mobilisation Forces umbrella grouping of Iran-backed Shi\u2019ite militias near camp Taji north of Baghdad have killed six people and critically wounded three, an Iraqi army source said late on Friday. Two of the three vehicles making up a militia convoy were found burned, the source said, as well as six burned corpses. The strikes took place at 1.12am local time, he said.\u201d Here\u2019s more from the Trump event. Richard Luscombe, reporting from Miami: Some of Trump\u2019s biggest cheers came when he moved on to topics such as abortion and the \u201chard left\u2019s\u201d perceived war on religious freedom, and freedom of speech. \u201cWe believe in the right to life,\u201d he said, prompting lengthy cheers, and seemingly overlooking his own conversion from his 1999 position of being pro-choice. \u201cThere is no issue that Democrats have become more extreme [on] than the issue of life, he said, claiming to have asked Congress to prohibit late-term abortion and that he had issued an executive order stopping taxpayer money going to fetal tissue research. \u201cWe will not allow faithful Americans to be bullied by the hard left,\u201d Trump said. \u201cVery soon I\u2019ll be taking action in our schools to protects students\u2019 first amendment rights to pray.\u201d Using words carefully chosen to fire up his churchgoing audience, Trump accused Democrats of waging a \u201ccrusade\u201d against religious freedom. \u201cThe extreme left in America is... trying to replace God with socialism,\u201d he said. \u201cIn America, we don\u2019t worship government, we worship God. Since 2016 the left hasn\u2019t given up on their religious crusade against religion. Democrats have worked to remove the words \u201cSo help me God\u201d from the oath. Not going to happen. Not as long I\u2019m here.\u201d Trump has now been speaking for one hour. Guardian world affairs editor Julian Borger: State department officials have been trying to bolster claims from the president and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, that the killing of Suleimani stopped imminent attacks and was therefore an act of self-defence. \u201cHe was traveling around the region. He\u2019s not there on vacation. He is there for the specific purpose to plan multiple attacks against Americans and facilities, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s hanging out with Muhandis [the PMF militia deputy commander],\u201d said a senior state department official. \u201cWhy is he in the car with Muhandis?\u201d He added: \u201cThe threat picture that the intelligence presented made very clear that in the absence of decisive action, hundreds of Americans would be killed\u201d in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. \u201cThese were attacks targeting American diplomats, American military personnel, and American \u2013 facilities that house Americans. Whether it\u2019s \u2013 whether we\u2019re being hosted by the government or whether it\u2019s our own facility,\u201d he said. The official said that Suleimani would be hard for Iran to replace and so killing him had helped to stop attacks. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that Suleimani, I think, was in many ways the indispensable man, and with Suleimani dead, it will be very difficult for these proxies to be organized on the scale, lethality, and effectiveness that they had under Suleimani,\u201d the official said. Another official said: \u201cThere were things he could do that nobody else could do. He was not a decentralized manager; he was a hands-on, down-to-the-details manager. And we are not safe in the region as long as Iran is pursuing this general strategy, but we are safer without him than we are with him.\u201d A third official added Suleiman\u2019s death would reduce the pace of attacks on Americans. \u201cIt slows it down. It makes it less likely,\u201d the official said, adding: \u201cJesus, do we have to explain why we do these things?\u201d Leading up to the rally in Florida, where Trump is making case that Democratic leaders pose a threat to the religious freedoms he has protected, his administration announced that it would appeal a district court ruling that blocked a so called \u201cconscience rule\u201d that would have made it easier for healthcare workers to avoid assisting with abortion or other medical procedures on religious or moral grounds. Last month the New York Times reported that the rule \u201cis part of a broader agenda by the Trump administration, which says it wants to expand protections for the civil rights of healthcare workers, even as critics say it has weakened civil rights protections for certain patients. President Trump announced the rule last May at a Rose Garden event for the National Day of Prayer.\u201d Richard Luscombe, reporting from Miami, has more from the Trump rally: Trump wasted no time in gloating about the \u201cflawless strike\u201d that eliminated the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani after taking to the stage in Miami 10 minutes earlier than scheduled, and praying with faith leaders, including the pastor of the King Jesus international ministry, Guillermo Maldonado. \u201cIt was flawless strike that eliminated the terrorist ringleader,\u201d Trump said, claiming that his death will save the lives of \u201chundreds and hundreds of Americans\u201d. Qassem Suleimani has been killed and his bloody rampage is now forever gone. He was plotting attacks against America but now be assured his atrocities have been stopped for good. He was planning a very major attack and we got him.\u201d We are a peace loving nation,\u201d Trump went on. \u201cMy administration remains committed to establishing peace and harmony. We do not seek war we do not seek nation building.\u201d \u201cLet this be a warning to terrorists, if you value your life you will not threaten the lives of our citizens.\u201d Donald Trump has taken the stage at the \u201cEvangelicals for Trump\u201d event taking place now at a Florida megachurch and wasted no time in speaking to the drone strike that killed Qassem Suleimani, Iran\u2019s top general, doubling down on the claim that the military action interrupted an attack Suleimani had planned. He was preparing for an attack, Trump said of Iran\u2019s general, \u201cand we got him\u201d. (Trump\u2019s critics have pointed the unverified nature of that claim). The US president quickly moved on to his commitment to protecting Evangelical values, a point aimed at the dozens of evangelical leaders who have assembled at the Miami megachurch. Richard Luscombe, who\u2019s on the scene in Miami, observed that \u201cTrump is calculating that by appealing to evangelicals he can again lock in the support of a large power base of voters that helped propel him to the White House in 2016.\u201d That\u2019s it from me on the live blog today. My west coast colleague, Mario Koran, will take things over for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: In a short statement at his Florida resort, Donald Trump defended the drone strike that killed Qassem Suleimani, Iran\u2019s top general. \u201cWe took action last night to stop a war,\u201d the US president said. \u201cWe did not take action to start a war.\u201d The US is sending nearly 3,000 more army troops to the Middle East amid fears of reprisals over the killing of Suleimani. Mike Pence justified the Suleimani strike by claiming (without evidence) that Iran supported the September 11 attackers \u2013 prompting criticism from foreign-policy experts, who called the vice-president\u2019s assertion inaccurate and dangerous. Trump\u2019s Republican allies praised the strike as a necessary intervention to stop a \u201cmaster terrorist\u201d, but Democratic presidential candidates and lawmakers expressed fear that the attack could have disastrous consequences and set off \u201canother endless war\u201d in the Middle East. The commander of the Quds force, which was previously run by Suleimani, advised Iranians angry about the general\u2019s death to be \u201cpatient\u201d and witness the killing of Americans across the Middle East. Mario will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. Foreign-policy reporters criticized Mike Pence for linking Iran to the September 11 attackers without any evidence in order to justify the drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. (The vice-president also misstated the number of September 11 attackers as 12, rather than 19.) Florida\u2019s Democratic party rolled out some religious figures of their own to counter Donald Trump\u2019s afternoon appearance before a Christian evangelical congregation in Miami. Doug Pagitt, a pastor and executive director of Vote Common Good, an organization that mobilizes voters of faith, decried the president\u2019s event as a sham in a press call. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to use this rally and this base to give cover for his broken promises and his immoral policies,\u201d Pagitt said. \u201cIt is Trump\u2019s desperate response to the realization that he\u2019s losing his primary voting bloc, faith voters. He realizes he needs every last vote if he wants a shot at re-election [and] losing even five per cent ends his chances. \u201cMany of these voters realize that Jesus\u2019s admonition that you can gain the whole world and lose your very soul is coming into focus for them. While they will hear from Donald Trump that he is the best thing to ever happen to evangelical Christianity, these are voters who know that their faith does not depend on the power of the presidency.\u201d Pagitt said the rally offered faith voters two different visions of America. \u201cOne is to seek all that which benefits you and your agenda. The other is to think about others and to care for the common good,\u201d he said. Kevin Chambliss, a youth minister at Miami\u2019s Covenant Missionary Baptist church, spoke of the need to \u201chold truth to power\u201d. \u201cWe must hold this president accountable by calling out his disdain for law, we must speak up when he labels whole groups of people a racists, murderers and thieves, we have to speak up when he openly mocks people of disabilities, we must speak up when he unapologetically tries to use the government to discriminate against people because of their religious beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure we don\u2019t have another four years of Donald Trump, I see a better day in our country when those who need help the most can receive it with loving arms and not be taken advantage of as this president has done.\u201d In his short statement on the Suleimani strike, Trump repeated his administration\u2019s claim that the Iranian general was planning an imminent attack on US forces. \u201cLast night, at my direction, the United States military successfully executed a flawless precision strike that killed the number one terrorist anywhere in the world, Qassem Soleimani,\u201d the US president said in his statement. \u201cSoleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him.\u201d But it appears even some Penragon officials were unclear on what \u201cimminent and sinister attacks\u201d Trump was referring to. The New York Times reports: Trump administration officials have provided no specific details of what they said were imminent threats, and some Defense Department officials said they knew of only generalized threats that did not appear to be imminent. The vice president has jumped to Trump\u2019s defense to justify the drone strike that killed Qassem Suleimani, calling the Iranian general \u201can evil man who was responsible for killing thousands of Americans.\u201d But Pence\u2019s list of \u201catrocities\u201d was criticized by experts for including falsehoods, such as misstating the number of September 11 attackers and linking those terrorists to Iran without any evidence. Here is more of the short statement Trump delivered on the Suelimani strike moments ago at Mar-a-Lago: \u201cAs president my highest and most solemn duty is the defense of our nation and its citizens. Last night, at my direction, the United States military successfully executed a flawless precision strike that killed the number one terrorist anywhere in the world, Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him. \u201cUnder my leadership America\u2019s policy is unambiguous to terrorists who harm or intend to harm any American. We will find you. We will eliminate you. ... \u201cToday we remember and honor the victims of Soleimani\u2019s many atrocities and we take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over. Soleimani has been perpetrating acts of terror to destabilize the Middle East for the last 20 years. What the United States did yesterday should have been done long ago. ... \u201cAmerica will always pursue the interests of good people, great people, great souls, while seeking peace, harmony and friendship with all of the nations of the world.\u201d In his statement on the Suleimani strike, Trump praised the work of the intelligence agencies that he has previously criticized as part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d seeking to undermine his presidency. On top of that, US officials have offered few details about the imminent attack Suleimani was allegedly plotting against American forces, leading some of the president\u2019s critics to raise doubts about the veracity of the claim. Interestingly, the president\u2019s team called the White House press pool back to Mar-a-Lago after the reporters had already left for the airport to travel to Trump\u2019s event in Miami tonight. Once the press pool returned to the Florida resort, the president delivered his short statement on the Suleimani strike. Donald Trump will appear at a Miami megachurch later this afternoon intending to bolster his standing with evangelical Christians. But among the lines of supporters waiting to get in, last night\u2019s US military strike in Baghdad was a more popular topic of conversation. \u201cWe can get anybody, anywhere, anytime, anywhere there is terrorism,\u201d said Michael David Layne, 62, a US Army veteran and Trump supporter from Miami, who attends the King Jesus international ministry in West Kendall where Trump is expected to deliver remarks at 5pm ET. Praising the president for taking \u201cstrong action,\u201d Layne said the death of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani would help prevent future bloodshed. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just about last night or this morning, it\u2019s to prevent things all around the world. There\u2019s a lot of confusion in the world, a lot of things going on.\u201d He also believes Trump\u2019s Christian values helped to guide him ordering of the strike. \u201cHe might be a little rough around the edges for some people, but he says it like it is, and if some of things he says or the actions he takes upset some people it doesn\u2019t make him less of a man of God.\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201ccongregation\u201d of around 7,000 this afternoon is heavily Hispanic, reflecting the make up of the Miami church where the Latino pastor, Guillermo Maldonado, delivers services in English and Spanish. Maldonado, a Trump loyalist who has prayed with the president at the White House, raised eyebrows in a weekend sermon when he assured immigrant parishioners in the US without papers that they would not be at risk of detention or deportation if they attended today. It makes it likely that a president whose hard-line anti-immigrant position has led to the deportation of thousands of immigrants will be counting among his supporters some of those he has demonized through policies and actions. There were also a handful of demonstrators outside the church, which was playing soft gospel music over loudspeakers to the waiting faithful. Francisco Morales, 47, traveled 30 miles to the event from Fort Lauderdale with placards highlighting the 10 Commandments he says Trump has violated. \u201cHe\u2019s everything a Christian shouldn\u2019t be. He\u2019s about money and himself, he uses God\u2019s word to his benefit, he doesn\u2019t respect Christian holidays, he insults everyone. And he dishonors his wife, his daughter and all women,\u201d Morales said. In his short statement to reporters, Trump specifically said the US is not seeking \u201cregime change\u201d in Iran after the killing of general Qassem Suleimani. But just hours after the strike was carried out, the president\u2019s former national security adviser, John Bolton, expressed hope that the attack would be \u201cthe first step to regime change in Tehran.\u201d In his short statement to reporters at Mar-a-Lago, Trump said the US is \u201cready and prepared\u201d to take \u201cwhatever action is necessary\u201d against Iran. With that, the US president turned and left without responding to shouted questions from the White House press pool. Trump is delivering a statement to reporters at his Florida resort Mar-a-Lago, his first public remarks since the killing of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. \u201cWe caught him in the act and eliminated him,\u201d the US president said. \u201cWe take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over.\u201d \u201cWe took action last night to stop a war,\u201d Trump added. \u201cWe did not take action to start a war.\u201d The White House press pool was just brought into a room at Mar-a-Lago with a podium, where Donald Trump is expected to soon deliver a statement on the killing of Qassem Suleimani. Democratic senator Tim Kaine has filed a resolution to force a congressional debate on US military operations in Iran, a measure that would need only a majority of senators\u2019 support to pass. The Wall Street Journal reports: Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.) on Friday filed a war-powers resolution that would force a debate and vote in the Senate ending further military operations against Iran. The language would make it clear that the U.S. would still have the right to defend itself against imminent attack and that war against Iran would have to be explicitly authorized by Congress, he said. The 1973 War Powers Act gave Congress the ability to remove U.S. military forces from hostilities in the absence of a formal declaration of war. Such resolutions are privileged, meaning that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) couldn\u2019t block it from coming to the floor. It needs a simple majority of 51 senators to pass. If the House passes an identical resolution by majority vote, the bill would still be subject to a presidential veto. Last year, Mr. Trump vetoed a war-powers resolution that would have ended America\u2019s role in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The Russian foreign ministry has released its own statement on the conversation between minister Sergei Lavrov and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo regarding the Suleimani strike. The Russian government\u2019s statement said the US attack violates \u201cthe principles of international law\u201d and is \u201cfraught with grave consequences for regional peace and stability.\u201d In contrast, Pompeo said of his conversation with Lavrov that he \u201cemphasized that de-escalation is the United States\u2019 principal goal.\u201d Congressman Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, expressed fear that the Suleimani strike could lead to escalation between US and Iranian forces. \u201cI\u2019ve had the opportunity to get a briefing on the intelligence that led to the recent strikes, and I have profound concerns about the prospect for serious escalation,\u201d the California Democrat told reporters on Capitol Hill. Some of the president\u2019s critics are resharing his old tweets to argue Trump has broken his campaign promise to curtial America\u2019s presence in the Middle East. This 2011 tweet, incorrectly predicting Barack Obama would start a war with Iran to win reelection, has been frequently retweeted today. (Some Democratic lawmakers have accused Trump of only approving the Suleimani strike to improve his own reelection chances.) The president\u2019s critics have also pointed to this tweet from just three months ago, calling for an end to the \u201cEndless Wars.\u201d Democratic presidential candidates have also invoked the phrase \u201cendless wars\u201d today to warn about the potential repercussions of the Suleimani strike. Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson said she would be releasing a \u201cvideo update on the Iran situation today,\u201d but considering the self-help author has had to lay off her campaign staff nationally, the update will likely be a rather low-tech production. Senator Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the intelligence committee, released a statement condemning Qassem Suleimani as \u201cthe personification of a state sponsor of terrorism\u201d who had \u201cbecome the single most destabilizing force in the Middle East.\u201d \u201cIran and the Iranian people can now turn away from Soleimani\u2019s murderous adventurism, redirect the Quds Force\u2019s money into Iran\u2019s economy, bring home the troops Soleimani sent abroad, and move forward toward building a more peaceful region,\u201d Burr said of the general\u2019s death. But Burr\u2019s statement does not address the potential reprisals against US forces for the Suleimani strike or possible next steps in the Middle East. It\u2019s worth noting that Democrats are in agreement with Republicans about the thousands of deaths that Suleimani caused, but Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns that the costs of the general\u2019s killing may far outweigh the benefits. And Trump\u2019s allies don\u2019t seem to be coming up with much of a counterargument on that front. Defense secretary Mark Esper has canceled his planned personal leave, which he was scheduled to take later this month, in the wake of the Suleimani strike. The Pentagon released a statement last night calling the strike a \u201cdecisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad,\u201d claiming the Iranian general was \u201cactively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.\u201d But Esper has not made himself available to reporters today, leaving many questions about what action defense officials were trying to prevent. The killing of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani by the US in Iraq was an act of \u201cinternational terrorism,\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told state TV on Friday, the Associated Press reports. \u201cIt was an extremely dangerous, foolish escalation ... He was the most effective force fighting against Islamic State and al Qaeda terrorists,\u201d Zarif said. Defense officials told the AP that nearly 3,000 more troops from the 82nd Airborne Division would be deployed to the Middle East amid fears of reprisals against the US for the killing of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. The AP reports: The United States is sending nearly 3,000 more Army troops to the Mideast as reinforcements in the volatile aftermath of the killing of an Iranian general in a strike ordered by President Donald Trump, defense officials said Friday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision not yet announced by the Pentagon, said the troops are from the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. They are in addition to about 700 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne who deployed to Kuwait earlier this week after the storming of the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad by Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters. The commander of the Quds force, which was previously run by the late general Qassem Suleimani, advised Iranians to \u201cbe patient\u201d following the US drone strike and witness the deaths of Americans across the Middle East. Speaking on the Senate floor, Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer argued Trump \u201cdoes not have the authority for a war with Iran\u201d and questioned what \u201clegal basis\u201d the president had for the Suleimani strike. \u201cThe need for advance consultation and transparency with Congress was put in the Constitution for a reason,\u201d Schumer said, noting that Democratic leaders were not given advance notice of the strike. The New York Democrat added, \u201cWhen the security of the nation is at stake, decisions must not be made in a vacuum.\u201d As the US braces for possible reprisals following the killing of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, the Pentagon is reportedly deploying thousands of additional troops to the Middle East. The news comes after Iran\u2019s supreme leader promsied \u201csevere revenge\u201d on the US, but the move could anger some supporters of Donald Trump, who ran for president on the basis of curtailing America\u2019s military presence abroad. In the wake of the Suleimani strike, retaliation against the US seems virtually certain, although the exact nature of those reprisals remains unclear. The Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger reports: Iran has spent decades preparing for a moment like this, developing methods and networks around the world that give Tehran the widest possible choice when it comes to taking revenge. In the weeks immediately after the airstrike that killed Iran\u2019s most powerful general, the threat against Americans and their allies will be greatest in the Middle East, but the risk will balloon out across the globe over the months and years to come. Any US outpost in Syria and Iraq, military or diplomatic, is vulnerable to attacks, likely to come from Iranian-backed militias linked to Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, which has served as Tehran\u2019s most reliable fist in Iraq. In Iraq, there will be even less protection from the state, which is furious about the attack outside Baghdad airport. The supreme leader of Iran visited the family of Qassem Suleimani after the Iranian general was killed in a US drone strike, and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei posted a photo from the visit to his Instagram page. Speaking in the first caucus state of Iowa, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden warned that the Suleimani strike could bring the US to \u201cthe brink of a new kind of conflict in the Middle East.\u201d Two of the other frontrunners in the Democratic presidential primary, senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have similarly warned the killing of the top Iranian general could set the US on the path to war. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader of the US Senate, said all senators would be briefed on the drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani early next week. The Kentucky Republican also noted that key Senate staffers would be briefed by Trump administration officials later today. McConnell acknowledged that the operation in Baghdad \u201cmay prove controversial or divisive,\u201d but he advised his Senate colleagues to \u201cwait to review the facts and hear from the administration\u201d before passing judgement on the state of affairs. The Senate leader then turned his attention to the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, the timing and parameters of which remain deeply uncertain. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader of the US Senate, is speaking on the Senate floor about the drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. \u201cIran\u2019s master terrorist is dead,\u201d McConnell said, adding that Suleimani targeted US and Israeli forces and \u201cmasterminded Iran\u2019s malevolent and destabilizing work throughout the entire Middle East.\u201d \u201cNow his terrorist leadership has been ended,\u201d McConnell said. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said he has spoken to Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and \u201cemphasized that de-escalation is the United States\u2019 principal goal\u201d after launching a drone strike that killed Iran\u2019s top general. The French government has released a statement on the conversation between Jean-Yves Le Drian, the country\u2019s minister of Europe and foreign affairs, and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo regarding the Suleimani strike. \u201cThe minister underscored France\u2019s concern over the rise in tensions in the Middle East over the past several months, with a sudden escalation in Iraq in recent weeks,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cFor France and all of its partners, every effort must now be made to avoid a further escalation of tensions and to facilitate de-escalation in order to preserve the stability of Iraq and the region as a whole. \u201cIn the current situation, France calls on all the parties to show restraint and on Iran to avoid taking any measures liable to aggravate regional instability or lead to a serious nuclear proliferation crisis.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, released a statement on the Suleimani strike warning of the \u201cimmediate and very real dangers to American citizens in and out of uniform in the Middle East.\u201d \u201cThere is no question that Qassim Suleimani was a threat to that safety and security, and that he masterminded threats and attacks on Americans and our allies, leading to hundreds of deaths,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cBut there are serious questions about how this decision was made and whether we are prepared for the consequences.\u201d The former Indiana mayor concluded his statement by warning against the possibility of \u201canother endless war\u201d and implicitly criticizing Donald Trump, who has been active on Twitter today. \u201cAs we learn more in the coming days and weeks, one thing is clear: this must not be the start of another endless war,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe must act wisely and deliberately, not capriciously or through Twitter.\u201d Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA analyst who now serves as a Democratic congresswoman, wrote in a tweet thread that the Trump administration must immediately confer with Congress about its strategy following the Suleimani strike. Slotkin noted she served under two presidents, Barack Obama and George W Bush, who both decided against attacking Suleimani out of fear of retaliation. \u201cThe two administrations I worked for both determined that the ultimate ends didn\u2019t justify the means,\u201d Slotkin wrote. \u201cThe Trump Administration has made a different calculation. ... \u201cIt is critical that the Administration has thought out the moves and counter-moves this attack will precipitate, and is prepared to protect our diplomats, service members, and citizens serving overseas. ... \u201cThis Admin., like all others, has the right to act in self-defense. But the Administration must come to Congress immediately and consult,\u201d Slotkin continued. \u201cCongress needs to understand the Administration\u2019s plan as soon as possible.\u201d Barbara Slavin, the director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council, writes in a New York Times op-ed that the current state of US-Iranian relations is \u201ctragic\u201d and \u201cthe product of a series of strategic blunders\u201d. Slavin writes: Few tears will be shed in many parts of the world for Maj Gen Qassem Suleimani, whose Quds force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ruthlessly spread Iranian influence and contributed to the deaths of thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and Iranians, as well as hundreds of American servicemen in Iraq, over the past decade and a half. But revenge is not a strategy, and the killing of General Suleimani is a major \u2013 and incredibly risky \u2013 escalation with Iran, a pivotal country of some 80 million people that has been largely estranged from the United States for 40 years. It will cause more instability and the loss of more innocent lives. Any chances for American diplomacy with Iran are dead for the duration of the Trump presidency \u2013 if not longer. Instead of one nuclear proliferation crisis, with North Korea, there will most likely now be two, as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal completely collapses. The Sunni fundamentalists who killed Americans in their homeland \u2013 something Iran has not done so far \u2013 will rejoice. Russia and China will be happy to see the United States mired in the Middle East for the foreseeable future. Most Democratic lawmakers have criticised Donald Trump\u2019s authorisation of the Suleimani strike on the basis that the president did not seek congressional approval and acted without serious consideration of the potential consequences. However, some Democrats, including the congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, have started accusing Trump of only choosing to attack Suleimani because he believed it would help his chances in this year\u2019s presidential election. The Trump administration reportedly intends to brief the congressional \u201cgang of eight\u201d on the Suleimani strike soon, after Democratic leaders complained they were not given advance notice of the attack. The gang of eight includes the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, Senate intelligence committee chairman, Richard Burr, Senate intelligence committee ranking member, Mark Warner, House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, and House intelligence committee ranking member, Devin Nunes. Schumer has said he did not receive advance notice of the strike, and Pelosi said in a statement last night that the action \u201cwas taken without the consultation of the Congress\u201d. Mitra Jalali Nelson, an Iranian-Korean city council member in St Paul, Minnesota, posted a moving tweet thread last night in response to the killing of Qassem Suleimani. The city council member, who is one of only a handful of Iranian-Americans currently serving in elected office, said that fallout from the 9/11 attacks had scared many members of her community away from political engagement. \u201cFor so many Persian kids &amp; Iranian-American families in your lives today, this news has us sick and terrified. It isn\u2019t just political analysis &amp; viral Twitter takes to us. It is about a lifetime of broken U.S. Iran policy shaping a volatile current we have swum in for decades,\u201d Jalali Nelson wrote. \u201cWithout knowing what will happen or plunging into speculation what I can tell you on a human level is that this is a sickening, sad &amp; terribly dangerous moment in our history,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe need your solidarity. We need your congressional action, popular action, anything for #NoWarWithIran.\u201d Michael Morell, the former acting and deputy CIA director, predicted there would be \u201cdead civilian Americans\u201d as a result of the killing of Qassem Suleimani. \u201cSuleimani was an evil genius, he had a lot of American blood on his hands,\u201d Morell told CBS News. \u201cThe world is a better place without him. The problem is that comes at a very high cost. \u201cNumber one, there will be dead Americans, dead civilian Americans, as a result of this. Possibly over the next few days in any place where Iran has its proxies. Iraq is the most likely place, but also Lebanon, Bahrain, other places in the Middle East.\u201d Morell also predicted that Iran\u2019s proxies would \u201cconduct a terrorist strike that kills a senior American official\u201d. He added that the attack could take place \u201canywhere in the world\u201d, including potentially on US soil. Anti-US protests are sweeping Iran, as supporters of general Qassem Suleimani take to the streets to burn American flags and chant: \u201cDown with USA!\u201d One man praised Suleimani as a \u201cself-giving person\u201d and another attacked America as a \u201cterrorist state\u201d. In a new tweet, Donald Trump suggested the Iraqi government was acting ungrateful to the US after American forces launched a drone strike in Baghdad, killing the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. The Iraqi prime minister said in a statement earlier today that the drone attack represented \u201ca flagrant violation of Iraqi sovereignty and a dangerous escalation\u201d. One of Donald Trump\u2019s congressional allies, Lindsey Graham, said he was briefed on the imminent drone strike that killed Suleimani when he visited the US president at his Florida resort earlier this week. Graham\u2019s admission is notable considering Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, has suggested she was not given advance notice of the strike. \u201c[T]his action was taken without the consultation of the Congress,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement last night. \u201cThe full Congress must be immediately briefed on this serious situation and on the next steps under consideration by the administration, including the significant escalation of the deployment of additional troops to the region.\u201d The chairman of Britain\u2019s foreign affairs committee in the last parliament has suggested that the UK government was not aware that the US was going to carry out an airstrike attempting to kill Suleimani. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat said \u201cthe purpose of having allies is that we can surprise our enemies and not each other\u201d. \u201cI would urge the US administration to share much more closely with allies, particularly those who are fighting alongside in the region, including us,\u201d he told the BBC News channel. The world \u201ccannot afford\u201d another war in the Gulf, according to the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, who has issued a statement calling for leaders to \u201cexercise restraint\u201d. Farhan Haq, deputy spokesman for the secretary general, said: The secretary general has consistently advocated for de-escalation in the Gulf. He is deeply concerned with the recent escalation. This is a moment in which leaders must exercise maximum restraint. The world cannot afford another war in the Gulf. In Israel, the army has closed the Mount Hermon ski resort on the annexed Golan Heights, a disputed territory which borders Syria and Lebanon. Fighters from the Iranian-backed Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah, Israel\u2019s bitter foe with which it fought a devastating war in 2006, are deployed on the other side of the armistice line. The AFP press agency reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a foreign visit while his defence minister, Naftali Bennett, chaired a meeting of security chiefs, including the heads of the army, the national security council and the Mossad intelligence agency. Royal Jordanian Airlines has suspended flights to Baghdad airport due to the security situation in the Iraqi capital, according to Reuters. The state carrier, which has 18 scheduled flights every week to Baghdad, said its flights to other Iraqi cities were not affected and operating normally. We\u2019d like to hear from US citizens in Iraq about their situation following embassy advice to leave the country. We would like to hear from you if you are a US citizen in Iraq, or if you know someone who has been affected by the order to evacuate. You can get in touch by filling in the encrypted form contained in this link and below, anonymously if you wish. So what next? The word \u201casymmetric\u201d is being used quite a bit by experts and those familiar with Middle East geopolitics to describe the likely response Iran will take. In short, it won\u2019t be a military one in the conventional sense. Qassem Suleimani had the status of a national hero even among secular Iranians and his death could act as a rallying cry, writes Mohammad Ali Shabani, a doctoral researcher at Soas University of London. He writes in a piece for the Guardian: ... at a time when his unprecedented sanctions had stirred unrest inside Iran, the political elite has just been handed a rallying cry. The strike on Suleimani, whose status approached that of national icon, will harden popular sentiment against the US while simultaneously shoring up the regime. For all his crowing about the decisive blow dealt to an insolent enemy, Trump may be about to discover that the problem with martyrs is that they live forever. Donald Trump has been on Twitter again, this time saying that Suleimani \u201cshould have been taken out years ago\u201d and that he was \u201cboth hated and feared\u201d within Iran. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog from Aamna Mohdin The chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the last parliament has suggested the UK government did not know the US was going to carry out an airstrike to kill Suleimani. Tom Tugendhat told BBC News: \u201cWell I\u2019ve long believed that the purpose of having allies is that we can surprise our enemies and not each other, and it\u2019s been a pattern, sadly, which has been a bit of a shame, that the US administration of late has not shared with us and that is a matter of concern. \u201cI would urge the US administration to share much more closely with allies, particularly those who are fighting alongside in the region, including us.\u201d He added: \u201cBut this is a tactical point. A strategic point is that the United States has rocked the regime much more than for example the death of Osama bin Laden rocked the jihadist movement. This is a much more significant incident.\u201d Tugendhat said the airstrike \u201cwill doubtless have consequences\u201d. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has said the airstrikes that killed Qassem Suleimani \u201csaved American lives\u201d. Speaking on CNN, Pompeo said the Iranian general was \u201cactively plotting in the region to take action, big actions he described it, that would have put thousands, if not hundreds American lives at risk\u201d. Pompeo said the airstrike was driven by \u201can intelligence-based assessment\u201d, adding: \u201cThe American people also know the history of Qassem Suleimani. Hundreds of American lives on his hands too.\u201d He added: \u201cLast night was the time we needed to strike to make sure that this imminent attack that he was working actively was disrupted.\u201d When asked if there was any imminent threat to US homeland, Pompeo said: \u201cThese were threats located in the region.\u201d Pompeo went on to say that Donald Trump has shown \u201cenormous restraint to date\u201d, but added the government had to act because \u201cthe risk of doing nothing was enormous. Intelligence community made that assessment.\u201d You can watch the full interview below. Here\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s latest tweet on the crisis. The Liberal Democrats have criticised Donald Trump for \u201cradically and recklessly\u201d escalating tensions in the Middle East. The Lib Dem acting leader, Ed Davey, said: \u201cIran is governed by a brutal regime which has been openly hostile to the west. \u201cDonald Trump has yet again radically and recklessly escalated tensions in an area where peacekeeping was already on a knife edge. \u201cThere is a real danger this will stoke further conflict, undermining peace and stability in the region. Given the severity of the crisis, the prime minister must make a statement about the UK\u2019s position immediately. \u201cThe UK should not automatically follow whatever position the Trump administration takes, but work with a broader group of concerned states at the United Nations.\u201d The US assassination of Qassem Suleimani may have dealt a final blow to hopes of keeping the Iranian nuclear deal alive until the American elections next year, European diplomats fear. There is also concern that the Iraqi parliament will seek to expel the 5,000 US troops from Iraq with unpredictable consequences for the region, including the fight against Islamic State. These private concerns were voiced amid public European calls for all sides to de-escalate the crisis, appeals that are unlikely to be heeded in Tehran, which is intent on some form of reprisal. In a statement that neither condemned nor condoned the killing of Suleimani, the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: \u201cWe have always recognised the aggressive threat posed by the Iranian Quds force led by Qassem Suleimani. Following his death, we urge all parties to de-escalate. Further conflict is in none of our interests.\u201d France\u2019s European minister, Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, also called for calm. Speaking on French radio, she said any military escalation was always dangerous. \u201cAt European level, we have to work in collective multilateral frameworks and prevent the powers, one against the other, from playing their game in an unpredictable manner,\u201d she said. \u201cOur role is not to stand on one side or the other, it is to speak with everyone.\u201d She said the French president, Emmanuel Macron, would be consulting widely on Friday Mike Pompeo has said the US remains committed to de-escalation with Iran in a series of tweets. The US secretary of state says he has spoken to the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, China\u2019s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and Germany\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, Heiko Maas, about the US decision to kill Suleimani, who commanded Iran\u2019s elite Quds force. Here\u2019s a report by the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, Richard Partington, on what rising oil prices mean for the escalating crisis in the Middle East and the world economy. Iraq\u2019s military has condemned the killing of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the Iraqi paramilitary leader who died alongside Qassem Suleiman, Iran\u2019s top general. The Iraqi military said it was a clear breach of the US mandate in Iraq, according to a report by Reuters. \u201cThe Joint Operations Command mourns the hero martyr ... who was martyred last night in a cowardly and treacherous attack carried out by American aircraft near Baghdad international airport,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe affirm that what happened is a flagrant violation of Iraqi sovereignty and a clear breach by the American forces of their mandate which is exclusively to fight Islamic State and provide advice and assistance to Iraqi security forces.\u201d The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has defended the US airstrike that killed Qassem Suleimani. In a statement, Netanyahu said: \u201cJust as Israel has the right of self-defence, the United States has exactly the same right. \u201cQassem Suleimani is responsible for the death of American citizens and many other innocent people. He was planning more such attacks. \u201cPresident Trump deserves all the credit for acting swiftly, forcefully and decisively. Israel stands with the United States in its just struggle for peace, security and self-defence.\u201d Experts have warned that the strike on Iran\u2019s top general puts the US and allies, including the UK, at risk. Ian Bond, foreign policy director at the Centre for European Reform, tweeted that the airstrike was a \u201cbig escalation\u201d by Trump. Dr Jack Watling, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told the news agency PA Media that the attack was \u201cvery significant\u201d because it was a \u201cdeclared assassination\u201d outside a declared armed conflict. But he said that Iran was not likely to want to provoke a war with the US. \u201cThe significance of this strike is that it is a declared assassination of a senior officer in another state with whom the US is not in a declared armed conflict and conducted on the territory of a third party,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very significant development in and of itself. Ultimately Iran does not want to provoke a full-scale conflict. I would expect there will be attacks on US forces, but they will be conducted with care.\u201d Watling added if the UK was seen by Iran to be participating in US actions it could lead to the capture or arrest of British citizens in the region. \u201cThe Iranians do not draw a direct line between the UK and US. However, if the UK is perceived to be participating in US actions then they will directly target UK interests,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThe UK is not automatically the first target. Citizens in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon would certainly potentially be at risk. Dual nationalities in Iran will certainly be at risk of arrest under espionage charges.\u201d John Bolton said he hoped the assassination of Qassem Suleimani was \u201cthe first step to regime change in Tehran\u201d. The former US national security adviser tweeted his congratulations to all involved in assassinating Iran\u2019s top general, describing the strike as long in the making. The UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killing has said the targeted killings of Qassem Suleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis violates international human rights law. In a Twitter thread, Agn\u00e8s Callamard said the US would need to prove the individual targeted constituted an imminent threat to others. \u201cAn individual\u2019s past involvement in \u2018terrorist\u2019 attacks is not sufficient to make his targeting for killing lawful,\u201d she said. On the White House statement about the airstrike, Callamard said: \u201cThe statement fails to mention the other individuals killed alongside Suleimani. Collateral? Probably. Unlawful. Absolutely.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, the current leader of the Labour party who is set to step down following a Conservative landslide at the last general election, has said \u201cthe US assassination\u201d of the general \u201cis an extremely serious and dangerous escalation of conflict in the Middle East with global significance\u201d. In a statement, Corbyn notes: \u201cThe UK government should urge restraint on the part of both Iran and the US, and stand up to the belligerent actions and rhetoric coming from the United States.\u201d Here\u2019s a roundup of reactions from Labour leadership hopefuls to a US airstrike in Baghdad killing Qassem Suleimani, Iran\u2019s top general. Nick Robinson, BBC\u2019s Radio 4\u2019s Today programme host, described the event as \u201ca very early test for those who want to be leader of the opposition\u201d. Keir Starmer, the current frontrunner to win the Labour leadership, tweeted that the incident is \u201can extremely serious situation\u201d and called for all sides to de-escalate tensions. The Labour MP Lisa Nandy, who is also considering a run to replace Jeremy Corbyn, described the airstrike as \u201ca very dangerous moment\u201d. She added: \u201cSeventeen years after the catastrophic decision to go to war in Iraq, violence still rages every day. World leaders must stand up to Trump. The last thing we need is another all-out war.\u201d Jess Phillips, the Labour MP who is expected to formally declare her bid to lead the Labour party, said: \u201cReckless foreign policy does not show strength. It\u2019s not a game. The consequences of the escalating tensions between the US and Iran are not to be underestimated, not just once again on the civilians in the region but on the whole world.\u201d Robinson asked Melanie Onn, former Labour MP who recently lost her seat but is supporting Phillips: \u201cShould people like Jess Phillips take a sort of Corbyn stand, or should she be wary of those who criticise Mr Corbyn for seeming to back the wrong side in international conflict.\u201d In response, Onn said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone who is trying to emulate somebody else is the right person for the Labour party.\u201d Oil prices soared early on Friday morning after the US airstrike that killed the top Iranian commander, increasing tensions between the two powers. Oil prices rose over $2 a barrel, while gold and other safe-haven assets jumped on Friday, Reuters reported, adding \u201ctraders were clearly spooked\u201d by Qassem Suleimani\u2019s death. The news agency also reported that foreign oil companies were evacuating dozens of employees with US citizenship from Basra in Iraq, citing company sources. The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has urged \u201call parties to de-escalate\u201d after the US airstrike that killed the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. In a written statement, Raab said: \u201cWe have always recognised the aggressive threat posed by the Iranian Quds force led by Qassem Suleimani. Following his death, we urge all parties to de-escalate. \u201cFurther conflict is in none of our interests.\u201d China has called for all sides to exercise calm and restraint. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang called for peace and stability in the Middle East as well as respect for Iraq\u2019s independence and territorial integrity, AP reported. The spokesman said China had always opposed the use of force in international relations and warned against the further escalation of tensions. Iraq will hold an emergency parliament session on Saturday to discuss the US airstrike in Baghdad that killed Iran\u2019s top military commander and Iraqi officials, Reuters reports. Iraq\u2019s deputy parliament speaker, Hassan al-Kaabi, said it was time to put an end to US recklessness and arrogance, adding that Saturday\u2019s session would be dedicated to taking \u201cdecisive decisions that put an end to US presence inside Iraq\u201d. The outgoing prime minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi had called for an emergency session, saying the US presence in Iraq is limited to training forces to fight terrorism. He described the attack that killed Qassem Suleimani and the Iraqi officials as a \u201cviolation\u201d of conditions for the US troop presence. Tom Fletcher, a former UK ambassador to Lebanon, has said Qassem Suleimani was a \u201cmuch more powerful figure than Osama bin Laden or Baghdadi, where at the moment of their own deaths their power was in decline. His [power] was growing, as it has been really since the US invasion of Iraq.\u201d He added that it was \u201chard to overstate the potential impact of this moment\u201d. Fletcher said Iran had been \u201cgoading Washington, goading Donald Trump\u201d, adding: \u201cAnd of course, we don\u2019t just have erratic leaders at the moment in Tehran, we have an erratic leader in Washington as well.\u201d When asked how Iran could retaliate, Fletcher said: \u201cThe strategic response if they\u2019re feeling rational is probably to consolidate their position in Iraq, but elsewhere they have many more dangerous options including assassinations themselves or proxy wars or asymmetric attacks like the ones against the Saudi oil facilities.\u201d What does Qassem Suleimani\u2019s death mean for the region? The assassination threatens to open a grisly new chapter in Middle East, writes the Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger. In his analysis, Borger notes Suleimani\u2019s death dispensed with the proxy war between Iran and the US, describing the airstrike as a \u201cdagger thrust into the heart of Iranian power\u201d. The leader of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Quds force was a bearded icon of the Islamic Republic, arguably its second most powerful figure after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Killing him was a blunt act of war against a substantial regional power. Its half-million-strong armed services are the most potent military force the US has faced since confronting the Chinese People\u2019s Volunteer Army more than 60 years ago in Korea. There was nothing inevitable about this conflict. Six years ago the legacy of loathing left by the Islamic Revolution began to fade. There was a multilateral agreement to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear programme in 2015, and an unspoken mutual non-aggression pact with Suleimani during the shared campaign against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. \u201cFor a while when we were doing counter-Isis operations, we essentially had a gentleman\u2019s agreement with him, that his forces wouldn\u2019t target us and we wouldn\u2019t target him,\u201d said Kirsten Fontenrose, the former senior director for the Gulf in Trump\u2019s national security council. But with Trump\u2019s abrogation of the 2015 nuclear deal and the collapse of the Isis caliphate, largely removing a common foe, it was Suleimani who emerged as the US\u2019s arch-enemy. \u201cHe was a target of opportunity,\u201d Fontenrose said. \u201cWhen you know a super-bad guy is going to be somewhere that you can strike and you know you won\u2019t get the opportunity for another year.\u201d Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is detained in Iran, warned the relationship between Iran and the US and UK was rapidly deteriorating. He told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: \u201cThings are getting much worse again between the US and Iran, but also between all of us and Iran.\u201d He added: \u201cI sit here partly worried for what that means for Nazanin, partly worried what that means for my in-laws, sat in their ordinary living room in Tehran where they\u2019re all really worried.\u201d In December, Zaghari-Ratcliffe announced she would be going on hunger strike in solidarity with another dual national being held in Iran. Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a British-Australian academic, started an open-ended hunger strike six days ago in protest at being sentenced to 10 years on espionage charges. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was jailed four years ago, and other imprisoned dual nationals in Tehran believe they are being held as political hostages. Israeli\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has cut short a visit to Greece following the killing. The prime minister\u2019s office said he was returning to Israel early \u201cto follow developments\u201d but did not say when. Israel, which has fought an increasingly overt war against Iranian forces in neighbouring Syria, is preparing itself for a potential military retaliation from Tehran to the US attack. Netanyahu was in Athens following the deal signed by Greece, Cyprus and Israel on Thursday to build a 1,900km (1,180-mile) subsea pipeline to carry natural gas from the eastern Mediterranean\u2019s rapidly developing gas fields to Europe. Former Middle East minister Alistair Burt has described the US airstrike that killed Iran\u2019s Gen Qaseem Suleimani as \u201cextremely serious\u201d and warned it could spark a huge escalation. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThere is no agreement as to a base of the confrontations in the region. There is a completely different narrative put forward by the Iranians for what is happening in the region to that which is put forward by the United States and others \u2013 there is no meeting between to two.\u201d Burt added that the airstrike could cause \u201ca huge potential escalation\u201d of the conflict, of which \u201cthe consequences are unknown\u201d. He said that it was \u201cvery important now to concentrate on what happens next, and for everybody involved diplomatically to do everything they can to try and defuse the situation\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely serious.\u201d Asked whether the UK government would have been told about the US government\u2019s airstrike plans before they happened, Burt replied: \u201cI doubt it.\u201d In July, Burt wrote a comment piece for the Guardian warning that the next prime minister had to become an expert on Iran, fast. He wrote: The worry is that crises escalate and mistakes occur. Iran is responding to the economic pressure, particularly the ban on oil sales, by reminding the world of Gulf vulnerability. Tit-for-tat moves on shipping will sooner or later lead to a fatal confrontation \u2013 we would be wise to work with others on an escort system, not to exacerbate, but reduce the risk by preventing more seizures. These events give credibility to those calling for an increase in defence spending, particularly on smart deterrents. Who is Qassem Suleimani? Here\u2019s a useful explainer on the leader of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Quds force by Michael Safi, the Guardian\u2019s international correspondent, based in the Middle East: Qassem Suleimani had become well known among Iranians in past years and was sometimes discussed as a future president. Yet the leader of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Quds force was still a relatively obscure figure outside a region that he may have done more than anyone to reshape. \u201cHe was more important than the president, spoke to all factions in Iran, had a direct line to the supreme leader and was in charge of Iran\u2019s regional policy,\u201d said Dina Esfandiary, a fellow at the Century Foundation think tank. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get more important and influential than that.\u201d The shadowy Quds force are tasked with spreading Iran\u2019s influence abroad and, in the past two decades, Suleimani, 62, had extraordinary success doing so. In the chaos and death that followed the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq and the 2011 Syrian revolution, Suleimani saw opportunity, pouring in men and money to build a crescent of pro-Iran forces stretching across the region from Lebanon in the west to Yemen in the south. Read more below The United States embassy in Baghdad has called on all it citizens to depart Iraq immediately on Friday. The order follows the US airstrike killing Iranian Quds Force leader Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in an air strike. \u201cDue to heightened tensions in Iraq and the region, the US embassy urges American citizens to heed the January 2020 travel advisory and depart Iraq immediately. US citizens should depart via airline while possible, and failing that, to other countries via land,\u201d it said in a statement. Good morning. I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin and thank you for joining our rolling coverage of air strike, ordered by the US president, Donald Trump, that killed powerful Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Suleimani\u2019s death is widely being seen as a dramatic escalation of the continued struggle between Washington and Tehran for influence across the region. The general, who ran Iranian military operations in Iraq and Syria, was hit while being driven from Baghdad airport by local allies from the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU). Julian Borger, the Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, and Martin Chulov, who covers the Middle East for the Guardian, have the latest on the airstrike: General Suleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,\u201d a Pentagon statement said. \u201cThis strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans. The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.\u201d Minutes before the statement Trump tweeted a US flag without comment. Later, the White House put out a statement saying the strike was a \u201cdecisive defensive action\u201d carried out \u201cat the direction of the president\u201d. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, ordered three days of mourning and vowed that the US would face \u201csevere revenge\u201d for the killing. Minutes before the White House released its statement, Trump tweeted a US flag without comment. The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, released the following statement on Twitter:",

      "body": "<p>Peak TV is a phrase that has long been used to describe our current era, in which there seems to be an epochal masterpiece airing every week. But in 2020, all previous uses of the term will look quaint. It is a year full of bold statements, massive names and even bigger budgets. The strutting king and slightly awkward prince of streaming, Netflix and Amazon, face competition from Apple and Disney, whose rival services have already launched (Disney+ comes to the UK in March), with HBO Max arriving in May in the US to saturate the new streaming market still further. It turns out we were nowhere near the top of the peak, but this year maybe we will get close.</p> <p>Once, a piece recommending the best dramas would essentially be a list of what we were going to be watching, like it or not: even if you didn\u2019t fancy a new show, chances were you\u2019d tune in anyway for the lack of alternatives. Now there is a vast selection to choose from, with big, new online shows in addition to programmes from the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky. Those traditional broadcasters, meanwhile, are getting in on the US goldrush by not just importing shows but co-producing them: Lena Dunham\u2019s Industry, for example, a saga about the personal lives of young bankers, has been made jointly by HBO and BBC Two, while Sky is HBO\u2019s collaborator for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/02/the-new-pope-review-john-malkovich-paolo-sorrentino-jude-law\">The New Pope</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jude-law\">Jude Law</a>-starring sequel to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/03/the-young-pope-review-jude-laws-sleek-pontiff-shines-in-sorrentinos-twin-peaks\">Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/03/the-young-pope-review-jude-laws-sleek-pontiff-shines-in-sorrentinos-twin-peaks\">The Young Pope</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cc68f91af32dad669c5e8375702f8c190cd55a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cc68f91af32dad669c5e8375702f8c190cd55a4/0_0_4000_2666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mandalorian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucasfilm Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Will all this mean better telly, though?

      "bodyText": "Peak TV is a phrase that has long been used to describe our current era, in which there seems to be an epochal masterpiece airing every week. But in 2020, all previous uses of the term will look quaint. It is a year full of bold statements, massive names and even bigger budgets. The strutting king and slightly awkward prince of streaming, Netflix and Amazon, face competition from Apple and Disney, whose rival services have already launched (Disney+ comes to the UK in March), with HBO Max arriving in May in the US to saturate the new streaming market still further. It turns out we were nowhere near the top of the peak, but this year maybe we will get close. Once, a piece recommending the best dramas would essentially be a list of what we were going to be watching, like it or not: even if you didn\u2019t fancy a new show, chances were you\u2019d tune in anyway for the lack of alternatives. Now there is a vast selection to choose from, with big, new online shows in addition to programmes from the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky. Those traditional broadcasters, meanwhile, are getting in on the US goldrush by not just importing shows but co-producing them: Lena Dunham\u2019s Industry, for example, a saga about the personal lives of young bankers, has been made jointly by HBO and BBC Two, while Sky is HBO\u2019s collaborator for The New Pope, the Jude Law-starring sequel to Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s The Young Pope. Will all this mean better telly, though? Certainly it will mean more expensive, good-looking event series, in the form of franchise behemoths such as Disney+\u2019s Star Wars spin-off The Mandalorian and the first of its many planned Marvel series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Or grand undertakings such as Masters of the Air, a continuation of the Band of Brothers family of second world war dramas that is said to be costing Apple TV+ a quarter of a billion dollars. The main impact on the amount of superb TV, however, is likely to come less from money and more from talent: actors made the move from cinema to living room some time ago, but 2020 is the year when auteur directors will start to follow in earnest. La La Land\u2019s Damien Chazelle has his jazz musical The Eddy coming to Netflix and another project in the pipeline for Apple, which also has Steven Spielberg\u2019s remake of his 1980s compendium Amazing Stories. Spielberg is fully embracing smaller screens: he is also bringing After Dark to Quibi, a mobile-friendly platform that launches in the spring. The BBC has convinced a big-name director to commit to the small screen, too: Steve McQueen will direct Small Axe, an anthology about black Britons in the 1970s. That is not to say that these stars of cinema will necessarily make finer dramas than the acclaimed showrunners that TV has already. Netflix\u2019s lucrative deal with Glee/Feud/Pose creator Ryan Murphy has already borne fruit in the form of The Politician, and in 2020 he\u2019ll follow that with One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest prequel Ratched. Grey\u2019s Anatomy mastermind Shonda Rhimes, meanwhile, lands on Netflix with Bridgerton, a fizzy period drama set in Regency England. Dystopias and alternate realities will continue to thrive in 2020: Jude Law and Naomie Harris visit a weird microcosmic island for Sky\u2019s The Third Day, which, intriguingly, is produced by pioneering immersive theatre company Punchdrunk; while the BBC dramatises Malorie Blackman\u2019s racial role-reversal novel Noughts + Crosses; and HBO tasks The Wire creators David Simon and Ed Burns with adapting Philip Roth\u2019s The Plot Against America. Prestige TV has the time, space and budget to do justice to novels, and there is room for more adaptations than ever. Of the new digital players, Apple TV+ seems to have a particular fondness for books, with versions of Lisey\u2019s Story by Stephen King (starring Julianne Moore and Clive Owen), The Mosquito Coast by Paul Theroux (written by Luther creator Neil Cross), and Isaac Asimov\u2019s Foundation series (featuring Jared Harris) all providing screen versions of novels that might otherwise have had to make do with bowdlerised films. That said, the BBC has been the master of this game for decades and will continue in 2020, with major small-screen versions of Sally Rooney\u2019s Normal People, The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton and the hefty A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth, scripted for TV by House of Cards\u2019 Andrew Davies. All these micro-trends share the same fundamental property, which is that where there might once have been two or three big literary adaptations or dystopian thrillers or mega-budget dramatic landmarks in any 12-month period, now there will be seven or eight. This will be the year when even the most committed box-set binger is forced to throw up their hands and say: \u201cThis is simply too many hours of TV for me to cope with so I\u2019m just going to miss a load of stuff and not worry about it.\u201d And that\u2019s just the brand new series. How will we keep faith with Line of Duty, Ozark, The Crown, Save Me, Succession, Sex Education, Euphoria, Westworld, American Gods and Outlander as they all return? We can\u2019t. We won\u2019t.

Or maybe you really splashed out in the new year sales?</p> <p>Some people could end up being saddled with debts until long after the festive decorations have been put back up into the loft, so now is the time to take stock and give your finances a new year workout.</p> <p>Research released this week claimed nearly two-thirds of the UK working-age population \u2013 almost 27 million people \u2013 are beginning 2020 in debt. Of that total, 9 million have accumulated personal debt of between \u00a32,000 and \u00a310,000, while almost 5 million owe more than \u00a310,000 in loans and credit, according to a poll conducted by the comparison website money.co.uk.</p> <p>If you are in serious financial difficulty, seek free advice from an organisation such as <a href=\"https://www.nationaldebtline.org/\" title=\"\">National Debtline</a> as soon as possible.</p> <p>However, if your situation is not quite so precarious, there are things you can do to get your finances into better shape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ada426eb2de387fccfbe4fd33bb7598c43642bfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ada426eb2de387fccfbe4fd33bb7598c43642bfb/0_216_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Halifax logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Halifax is among those offering 0% interest on credit card balance transfers for up to 29 months where the fee is 3%.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Cut your credit card costs</strong></h2> <p>Many people with existing credit and store card debt could save hundreds of pounds, or even thousands, by transferring these balances to another provider offering a better rate. Play your cards right and you could pay no interest on your debts until well into 2022.</p> <p>Balance transfers can be a very good way of saving money on existing debts. Your aim should be to have paid off all that you owe by the time the promotional period ends.</p> <p>The weeks immediately after Christmas are typically the most popular for switching card balances: <a href=\"https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/sites/default/files/uploads/Data%20(XLS%20and%20PDF)/Card%20Spending%20Update%20-%20September%202019.pdf\" title=\"\">official industry data</a> shows that in January 2019, consumers made 701,000 transfers, with just over \u00a31.5bn moved in the space of 31 days. The average amount transferred over was \u00a32,198.</p> <p>Some credit cards are offering interest-free deals for more than two years. The main benefit of a 0% balance transfer deal is that all of your monthly repayment goes towards clearing the outstanding balance, and therefore the debt can be cleared much more quickly \u2013 but you do need to be disciplined. Also be aware that there will often be a fee to pay, which is typically a small percentage of the amount of debt being moved over.</p> <p>This has always been a competitive market, but card companies have been tightening their purse strings a little of late. This time three years ago, you could get balance transfer deals offering 0% interest for up to 43 months, but currently the most you can get is 29 months.</p> <p>Halifax and Sainsbury\u2019s Bank are among those offering 0% interest on balance transfers for up to 29 months where the fee is 3% \u2013 that is, \u00a330 per \u00a31,000 transferred. Virgin Money and MBNA are offering very similar deals.</p> <p>Let\u2019s say you transfer a \u00a32,198 balance over to the Halifax or Sainsbury\u2019s Bank card. Assuming you are accepted, if you pay \u00a378.07 a month for 29 months, you will clear the entire debt before the 0% offer expires, according to uSwitch (of course, you can always pay more than this). And those repayments include the \u00a365 balance transfer fee you will be charged.</p> <p>There are cards out there on which you pay a lower fee, or no fee at all. For example, Sainsbury\u2019s Bank has another deal where you get 0% interest on balance transfers for up to 26 months where the fee is 1%. Under the same scenario, if you pay at least \u00a385.38 a month for 26 months, you will clear the \u00a32,198 balance within the promotional period.

      "bodyText": "Did your debit and credit cards take a pounding in the run-up to Christmas? Or maybe you really splashed out in the new year sales? Some people could end up being saddled with debts until long after the festive decorations have been put back up into the loft, so now is the time to take stock and give your finances a new year workout. Research released this week claimed nearly two-thirds of the UK working-age population \u2013 almost 27 million people \u2013 are beginning 2020 in debt. Of that total, 9 million have accumulated personal debt of between \u00a32,000 and \u00a310,000, while almost 5 million owe more than \u00a310,000 in loans and credit, according to a poll conducted by the comparison website money.co.uk. If you are in serious financial difficulty, seek free advice from an organisation such as National Debtline as soon as possible. However, if your situation is not quite so precarious, there are things you can do to get your finances into better shape. Cut your credit card costs Many people with existing credit and store card debt could save hundreds of pounds, or even thousands, by transferring these balances to another provider offering a better rate. Play your cards right and you could pay no interest on your debts until well into 2022. Balance transfers can be a very good way of saving money on existing debts. Your aim should be to have paid off all that you owe by the time the promotional period ends. The weeks immediately after Christmas are typically the most popular for switching card balances: official industry data shows that in January 2019, consumers made 701,000 transfers, with just over \u00a31.5bn moved in the space of 31 days. The average amount transferred over was \u00a32,198. Some credit cards are offering interest-free deals for more than two years. The main benefit of a 0% balance transfer deal is that all of your monthly repayment goes towards clearing the outstanding balance, and therefore the debt can be cleared much more quickly \u2013 but you do need to be disciplined. Also be aware that there will often be a fee to pay, which is typically a small percentage of the amount of debt being moved over. This has always been a competitive market, but card companies have been tightening their purse strings a little of late. This time three years ago, you could get balance transfer deals offering 0% interest for up to 43 months, but currently the most you can get is 29 months. Halifax and Sainsbury\u2019s Bank are among those offering 0% interest on balance transfers for up to 29 months where the fee is 3% \u2013 that is, \u00a330 per \u00a31,000 transferred. Virgin Money and MBNA are offering very similar deals. Let\u2019s say you transfer a \u00a32,198 balance over to the Halifax or Sainsbury\u2019s Bank card. Assuming you are accepted, if you pay \u00a378.07 a month for 29 months, you will clear the entire debt before the 0% offer expires, according to uSwitch (of course, you can always pay more than this). And those repayments include the \u00a365 balance transfer fee you will be charged. There are cards out there on which you pay a lower fee, or no fee at all. For example, Sainsbury\u2019s Bank has another deal where you get 0% interest on balance transfers for up to 26 months where the fee is 1%. Under the same scenario, if you pay at least \u00a385.38 a month for 26 months, you will clear the \u00a32,198 balance within the promotional period. Again, what you pay back includes the fee, which in this case would be \u00a321. But with these deals, if you are late with a monthly payment or commit some other infraction that is not permitted under the small print, the 0% promotional rate will often be terminated immediately. Get a better overdraft deal Authorised overdrafts are designed for short-term borrowing, but the costs vary dramatically. Some banks have daily fees, some monthly; some charge interest, and some use a combination of these. But this is all changing as we speak \u2013 sweeping new industry rules designed to make overdrafts simpler and fairer will be in force by 6 April, and many banks are in the process of changing their pricing. HSBC and Nationwide have both announced a new single rate for all overdrafts of 39.9% per year (HSBC\u2019s takes effect on 14 March, while Nationwide\u2019s is already in place), resulting in higher costs for some customers and lower costs for others. Over the coming weeks, other banks will reveal what they are going to do. Many banks have overdraft calculators on their websites, so log on and compare what you would be charged by other financial providers.

At the turn of the century, thanks to an enlightened mayor, farmers up and down the valley, which runs parallel to the coast between Genoa and La Spezia, started switching to organic production. The idea spread to hotels and restaurants, artisanal producers and tourist initiatives and led, in 2013, to the creation of the Val di Vara <a href=\"https://www.biodistrettovaldivara.it/\" title=\"\">Biodistrict</a>, to represent the businesses and run community events.</p> <p>Today, 55% of the valley\u2019s 345 sq km of hilly terrain is under organic cultivation \u2013 compared with 11% in Italy as a whole (which in itself puts the UK\u2019s 2.9% to shame).

This has not been without a cost \u2013 one that\u2019s been borne primarily by local residents and businesses, who find themselves forced out of neighbourhoods by rising rents.

One such programme is <a href=\"https://revive.turismodeportugal.pt/en\">Revive</a>, designed to breathe new life into abandoned or run-down heritage sites. One of the first \u2013 of 33 \u2013 to open was Vila Gal\u00e9, a former convent converted into a hotel in Elvas, a Unesco-listed but overlooked town near the Spanish border.

They are not toiling alone: a small herd of rare-breed pigs has been clearing brambles and digging over the soil. Oh, and there are quite a few professional gardeners on board, too.</p> <p>This is the new RHS Garden Bridgewater, the biggest gardening project in Europe. The \u00a330m-plus site is due to open this summer on the site of Worsley New Hall, a 19th-century mansion on the edge of the city that was demolished in the 1940s. It is the RHS\u2019s first new garden in 17 years and first urban garden, it has been designed by landscape architect <a href=\"http://www.tomstuartsmith.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tom Stuart-Smith</a>. A million annual visitors are expected to generate \u00a313.8m a year for the local economy by 2029, with 140 jobs in the garden itself and 180 more in the surrounding area. </p> <p>Community is at the heart of this garden. Richard Green, the head of Bridgewater, says: \u201cThere is no other garden like this in the north-west of England, not on this scale. It is a mix of stunning horticulture and a place for people.\u201d</p> <p>As well as the green-fingered volunteers, GPs are already referring patients to the garden through a \u201csocial prescribing\u201d pilot scheme, whereby people struggling with isolation, mobility problems and other conditions are prescribed activities such as gardening. A dedicated therapeutic gardener, Ozichi Brewster, leads this programme, which has so far helped 40 people. Patients can plant hanging baskets, make bug hotels, go on woodland walks or join tai chi and yoga sessions in the wellbeing garden, a hub for community organisations such as dementia support groups and veterans.</p> <p>Young people have also been helping in the garden under the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/get-involved/take-part/national-citizen-service\" title=\"\">National Citizen Service</a>. Soon there will be classrooms and a learning garden \u2013 about 7,000 local schoolchildren will be invited every year \u2013 and apprenticeship schemes. Adults can garden in community allotments in the walled garden; four of the plots will be dedicated to growing produce for a local food bank. There are also demonstration areas to inspire visitors to transform their own gardens.</p> <p>Other prominent features include a kitchen garden, providing fruit and vegetables for the cafe; a Chinese garden created with Greater Manchester\u2019s Chinese community; and a calming \u201cparadise garden\u201d with a huge pond. A wild woodland play area with hobbit holes, a bug garden and a low ropes course is designed to help children of all ages get outside, connect with nature and socialise away from screens.</p> <p>Those who can\u2019t wait for the official opening in the summer can book a two-hour guided tour (\u00a35, until April). Or why not join the green army? The garden is recruiting now for its next batch of volunteers.</p> <p>Opens summer 2020.

The area contains some of the UK\u2019s most prized ecosystems \u2013 from its only sub-Arctic montane plateau to forests that are home to pine martens, wild cats, eagles, <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/capercaillie/\" title=\"\">capercaillie</a> and rare tooth-fungi.</p> <p>Committing to an ecological timeframe of 200 years (there\u2019s no room for a short-term mentality here), neighbouring land managers \u2014 including <a href=\"https://wildland.scot/\" title=\"\">Wildland</a>, RSPB Scotland, <a href=\"https://www.nature.scot/\" title=\"\">Scottish Natural Heritage</a> and Forestry and Land Scotland \u2014 will work together to restore native woodlands, peatlands, wetlands and rivers.</p> <p>In 2020, visitors will get a better sense of the project thanks to a newly refurbished visitor centre, interpretive walks and volunteering opportunities. Since 1959, when it was just a caravan parked on borrowed land, the <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/reserves-a-z/loch-garten/\" title=\"\">Loch Garten Osprey Centre in Abernethy</a> has grown into the RSPB\u2019s second-largest and most diverse reserve, home to more than 5,000 species. Thanks to funding from European Structural Funds, the centre will in 2020 be renamed and refurbished with improved access, and open for eight months of the year: the Loch Garten Nature Centre will help explain Cairngorms Connect as part of a wider conservation story.</p> <p>Beyond the centre, interpretive walks will be added to the Big Pines and Two Lochs trails to enhance understanding of the UK\u2019s largest single remnant of ancient Caledonian pinewood.</p> <p>While Cairngorms Connect\u2019s focus for 2020 is getting local communities involved, visitors will get a look-in, too.

Now the near-threatened species is grazing once again. Some 20,000 now live in America, mostly in small, often fenced-in, herds. But on the high plains of north-east Montana more than 800 beasts roam free. The conservation of this herd (or obstinacy) is just one of many wildlife projects run by <a href=\"https://www.americanprairie.org/\" title=\"\">American Prairie Reserve</a> (APR), a non-profit that aims to preserve vast tracts of wilderness.</p> <p>Using a similar model to the Tompkins Foundation in Chilean Patagonia, the APR makes strategic purchases of private land that it uses to stitch together tracts of existing public land. Since it started in 2004, APR has bought over 100,000 acres, which has been joined with public land to form 419,000 acres of rolling hills and grassy plateaux drained by the Missouri River. The goal is to form a prairie area of roughly 3.2 million acres, complete with migration corridors \u2013 the largest nature reserve in the continental US.</p> <p>The APR\u2019s activities have <a href=\"https://mountainjournal.org/the-american-prairie-reserve-and-its-dustup-over-bison-and-property-rights\" title=\"\">upset local ranchers and farmers</a>.

It\u2019s possible to walk, cycle or canoe for miles and see nothing manmade, except the odd signpost. Small-scale accommodation options include two campsites (from $15) with RV hookups; a safari-style lodge; and two pairs of large yurts \u2013 Founders Hut and John and Margaret Craighead Hut \u2013 each connected by a hallway and accommodating nine people in four bunk rooms.

The number of tour companies has also increased, with more of them travelling to remote, lesser-visited regions such as the national parks of Gal Oya and <a href=\"http://www.wilpattunationalpark.com/\">Wilpattu</a>, and the coastal areas of Kalpitiya and Kalkudah, benefiting smaller businesses including tuk-tuk drivers, souvenir sellers and family-run restaurants.</p> <p>The country\u2019s thriving tourism industry came to a halt with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sri-lanka-attacks\" title=\"\">Easter Sunday attacks in 2019</a>. <a href=\"http://www.sltda.lk/monthly-tourist-arrivals-reports-2019\" title=\"\">Visitor numbers were down 71% year-on-year </a><a href=\"http://www.sltda.lk/monthly-tourist-arrivals-reports-2019\" title=\"\">to May, and 57% </a><a href=\"http://www.sltda.lk/monthly-tourist-arrivals-reports-2019\" title=\"\">to June</a>. And according to figuress presented to the Foreign Office by British-based tour operators, up to 80% of hotel bookings were cancelled. In recent months, arrivals have been creeping up, particularly since most countries relaxed their travel restrictions, including the UK in June. Overall, however, figures are still down almost 20% \u2013 which is significant for the millions of people in Sri Lanka who rely on tourism, directly and indirectly.</p> <p>As the country looks ahead, there are projects to be celebrated. The <a href=\"http://www.srilankaecotourism.org/\" title=\"\">Sri Lanka Ecotourism Foundation</a>, running since 1998, supports social and economic development of rural communities. Its work ranges from renewable energy projects, such as small-scale wind-solar farm training programmes, to empowering women through ecotourism roles, including a new lagoon-side campsite and activity centre, the Hikkaduwa Women-Centric Ecotourism Project. It also launched a new national sustainable tourism certification for hotels in April 2019.</p> <p>Beyond this, there are compelling sustainability and community-based tourism projects all over the country.

This was due in no small part to the conservation work of American philanthropist Kristine McDivitt Tompkins (ex-CEO of outdoors company Patagonia) and her late husband Doug (co-founder of North Face), who donated a large chunk of the land. In 2020, it will be easier than ever to visit these remote reserves, thanks to the new <a href=\"https://www.rutadelosparques.org/en/\" title=\"\">Route of Parks</a>. Launched last year, the route consolidates a haphazard tourist circuit spanning 1,700 miles (and 17 national parks), from the volcano-dotted forests of Chile\u2019s Lake District to the fjords at the southern tip of the continent.</p> <p>Locals in the 60 communities along the route have responded to the Tompkins\u2019 vision by taking ownership of the wilderness and starting tourism projects that will help protect the parks in the long term (as well as create sustainable incomes). Chait\u00e9n-based <a href=\"http://rutapatagonia7.cl/\" title=\"\">Ruta Patagonia</a> 7 runs tours along the famed Carretera Austral (Southern Highway) to the newly designated <a href=\"http://www.parquepumalin.cl/en/\" title=\"\">Pumal\u00edn national park</a>, a rainforest reserve in remote northern Patagonia. Further south, <a href=\"http://www.patagonianfjords.com/\" title=\"\">Patagonian Fjords</a> has opened up the previously inaccessible \u2013 and newly created \u2013 Kaw\u00e9sqar national park to tourism for the first time, with trips through its fog-draped fjords departing from the resort town of Puerto Natales.</p> <p>New hotels have also popped up along the route, including <a href=\"http://estanciacaletajosefina.com/\" title=\"\">Estancia Caleta Josefina</a> (rooms from \u00a3135), on a sheep farm in Tierra del Fuego. And in 2018 <a href=\"http://www.patagoniapark.org/parque_patagonia.htm\" title=\"\">Patagonia national park</a> (home to one of the most ambitious rewilding efforts in the Americas) opened a new museum, Patagonia Park Museum, which explores local history and the current <a href=\"http://www.patagoniapark.org/threatened_species.htm\" title=\"\">extinction crisis</a>. Another museum dedicated to the Anglo-Argentine pioneer Lucas Bridges (author of Uttermost Part of the Earth, the 1947 landmark book on Tierra del Fuego) will open here in 2020.</p> <p>Connectivity, long a barrier to regional development, has improved alongside the new route. There is no land connection between the northern and southern sections of Chilean Patagonia, but a ferry service now links the end of the Carretera Austral with Puerto Natales, making it easier for tourists to travel along a unified path without detouring into Argentina. A road under construction in a remote stretch of Tierra del Fuego will finally open up little-visited Yendegaia national park, which protects the ice fields of the Cordillera Darwin mountain range.<br><strong>Mark Johanson</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Some areas, such as Lake Bled, have seen an influx of tourists over recent years but much remains off the beaten track - and the government has a strategy for sustainable tourism growth. Opened last year, the 270km Juliana Trail, a hiking route through the Julian Alps, takes walkers away from some of the most visited parts of Triglav national park in a bid to combat overtourism. The circular trail, which starts at Kranjska Gora near the Italian border, is divided into 16 stages, with most of the daily routes starting at a railway station or bus stop. Bike Slovenia Green offers another way of exploring a multi-stage itinerary through the Julian Alps, around Lake Bohinj and Lake Bled and on to the Adriatic coast. The series of one-day cycling loops visits places that have a Slovenia Green certificate, such as the karst village of Komen, known for fresh cheese ravioli, fresh herbs and prosciutto. Designed by sustainable travel agency Visit GoodPlace, and funded by the EU, the bike routes go through three wine regions, and take cyclists to family-run hotels via quiet roads and cycle paths. Also new for 2020 is a Best of Slovenia By Train trip from Inntravel. Travelling via Vienna and Venice, it makes use of Slovenia\u2019s charming, old-fashioned rail network and takes in highlights from alpine Bohinj to capital Ljubljana and Piran on the Adriatic coast. (from \u00a31,045 for seven nights, inntravel.co.uk). Jane Dunford Gothenburg Explore Sweden\u2019s eco-certified city Almost everything you can do in Gothenburg, you can do with a clean conscience. For the past three years Sweden\u2019s industrial second city has topped the Global Destination Sustainability Index, thanks to its efforts to \u201cminimise any negative impact on people and the environment\u201d. All major venues are eco-certified and 92% of hotel rooms hold an official eco-certification, making Gothenburg one of the world\u2019s greenest hotel cities. Even the Opera House, Concert Hall and Liseberg amusement park are eco-certified, and restaurants have good access to local and organic produce. Step off the train at the central station \u2013 you took the train, right? \u2013and walk five minutes to the ferry stop opposite the Opera House. The \u00c4lvsnabben ferry plies a gentle loop up and down the river and it is going electric in 2020. Gothenburg is a small big city, or maybe a big small city, with a cultural scene that includes Way Out West, a three-day summer music festival that is 100% vegetarian and has reduced its carbon footprint year on year. And, in half an hour, you can be deep in the Bohusl\u00e4n countryside, or kayaking upriver to picturesque Jonsered, with its sustainable hotel Le Mat. The Hagabion cafe and bar in the central Linn\u00e9 area is renowned for a vegetarian menu that changes daily. People gather here, too, for a drink before moving on to the many other restaurants, bars and venues nearby. At the heart of the city is the Gothia Towers hotel, the biggest hotel in Europe to be certified according to the Breeam standard for environmental certification. Out of season, rooms can be had for \u00a3100, though a luxury room with access to the spa and glass-bottomed pool on the 19th floor will cost (much) more. The kitchen garden on the roof boasts Sweden\u2019s highest apiary, with 150,000 bees. The garden produce is Krav-certified for sustainability and, like the herbs and spices grown here, the honey is used in the dishes of the Upper House restaurant, and in its own beer (brewed in-house). For the energetic, Gothenburg hosts the world\u2019s largest half marathon, with more than 60,000 runners. It also has many events for cyclists and swimmers, including the world\u2019s biggest annual swim-run event (1 August). Hire a bike to see the city and explore further afield. Put the bikes on the train for the 20-minute trip to the town of Kungsbacka, and cycle around Lygnern lake. Alternatively, stick to the southern coastal path from the centre to S\u00e4r\u00f6 island. There is no shortage of spots for wild swimming at lakes in and around Gothenburg. A short bus ride away is Gunnebo Slott manor house and gardens, with its organic restaurant \u2013 and lakes nearby. Typing badplats (bathing spot) into Google Maps will bring up a wealth of places with wooden quays and ladders into the water. There\u2019s canoe hire on Surtesj\u00f6n lake and nearby waters on the northern edge of the city, and sea-bathing to the south at N\u00e4set. On the island of Tj\u00f6rn, further north, the Pilane outdoor sculpture park is breathtaking. For unwinding afterwards, there\u2019s a free public sauna at Frihamnen, across the river from central Gothenburg. David Crouch Val di Vara Italy\u2019s \u2018greenest\u2019 valley The rolling Vara valley in north-west Italy is not unusual in suffering a haemorrhage of young people from rural communities but it is unusual in its response: going greener. At the turn of the century, thanks to an enlightened mayor, farmers up and down the valley, which runs parallel to the coast between Genoa and La Spezia, started switching to organic production. The idea spread to hotels and restaurants, artisanal producers and tourist initiatives and led, in 2013, to the creation of the Val di Vara Biodistrict, to represent the businesses and run community events. Today, 55% of the valley\u2019s 345 sq km of hilly terrain is under organic cultivation \u2013 compared with 11% in Italy as a whole (which in itself puts the UK\u2019s 2.9% to shame). And more than 100 business have organic certification. Farmers around San Pietro Vara are raising \u201cwild\u201d Limousin cattle with barely any human input and the Val di Vara dairy co-op makes cheeses to ancient recipes. The area\u2019s Bio Festival, launched in 2018, is now an annual event, with streetfood, games, livestock shows and music. And last summer the Biodistrict started running full-day bus tours of the valley from Levanto on the coast (\u20ac47 adult, \u20ac25 child, family 2+2 \u20ac141, including lunch and tastings). In the past few years, young locals have opened five farms to the public and started 13 agriturismos, offering rustic rooms and farmhouse meals, plus jams, liqueurs, olive oil or meat to buy. Try Il Risveglio Naturale or Il Filo di Paglia. Local cycling enthusiast Marco runs five-hour e-bike tours of the valley \u2013 in Italian and English \u2013 from agriturismo L\u2019Antico Cornio, with tastings of focaccia, cured meats, cheeses and wine (\u20ac60pp, book at foodyexperience.com). The capital of Val di Vara is Varese Ligure, a walled town dating from 1161, with a castle, medieval churches and a 16th-century stone bridge. On a small riverside square, Pietro Picetti, who is in his 70s, hand-carves wooden moulds for stamping corzetti (or croxetti), the local, disc-shaped pasta \u2013 once with prominent families\u2019 coat of arms; now often just with pleasing patterns, or your initials! Visitors can have an organic lunch of corzetti pasta with walnut sauce at Albergo Amici in Varese Ligure, before stocking up on foodie gifts from, say, honey and fruit farm Cascina le Bosche or herb and saffron producer Le Piccole Erbe. Dinner could be at the equally organic Antica Locanda Luigina in Mattarana. To work up an appetite for all this bounty, the Vara river and its tributaries offer kayaking, rafting and canyoning (valdivara.it) and the area is crisscrossed by footpaths including the Alta Via dei Monti Liguri \u2013 a 400km ridgetop cycling/hiking route. There\u2019s more adrenaline action on the high ropes and zipwires of Parco Avventura Val Di Vara. Liz Boulter Flims Laax Falera Eco-snow sports, Swiss-style The Flims Laax Falera region in eastern Switzerland\u2019s Graub\u00fcnden canton is well-endowed with natural beauty but there\u2019s a particularly primeval air to the landscape here. For starters there\u2019s the Rhine Gorge, known in the local Romansh language as Ruinaulta and more commonly as the Swiss grand canyon. After a huge landslide thousands of years ago, the Rhine scoured a path through the debris, creating what is now a dramatic summer playground for hikers, rafters and bikers. Hikers can also explore the Unesco site of Sardona, where tectonic plates once crunched together, pushing the rock upwards and leaving a distinct limestone line across the mountains. Winter offers snowy walking trails, pro-standard snowparks and 224km of slopes in three linked ski areas. With the highest piste topping 3,000 metres, snow is reliable, yet as in many other Swiss resorts, Flims Laax Falera has recently seen its snowline creep upwards and its ski season shorten. Its plans to tackle the climate crisis are more ambitious than most. In 2010 the Weisse Arena Gruppe, which operates the ski resort, introduced a Greenstyle project, aiming to gradually transform itself into the world\u2019s first self-sufficient, carbon-neutral alpine resort. Energy consumption has fallen by 15% over seven years, and all its electricity now comes from carbon-neutral sources. Ski lifts generate power through photovoltaic panels and waste energy is recovered and reused; piste bashers groom slopes at optimum energy efficiency; and the Rocksresort has twice been named best green ski hotel at the World Ski Awards. The three villages all have water refill fountains, recycling stations and charging points for electric cars, while an e-shuttle is bookable on the resort\u2019s app, with proceeds going to the Greenstyle Foundation. And this winter, a new weekly repair service at the Riders Hotel will mend ski clothing for free. Test out your rejuvenated gear on the slopes before stopping for a drink at the piste-hopping Travelling Bar, which is also doing its bit \u2013 10% of turnover goes to Greenstyle. Caroline Bishop Rotterdam A vision of the urban future Rotterdam is a city that\u2019s not afraid to experiment. From the architecture of Rem Koolhaas, one of its most famous sons, to the annual Rooftops Festival, which in 2019 saw 65 rooftops repurposed to host events, Europe\u2019s largest port is a fascinating living laboratory for anyone interested in what urban living might look like in the coming years. There\u2019s even a Sponge Garden for studying how best urban green spaces can be used to capture and hold rainwater and return it to the natural environment. Many of the city\u2019s innovations are focused on a waste-free circular economy. It\u2019s home to the world\u2019s first floating farm, where 32 cows are fed on scraps from local hotels and restaurants, and produce milk for city residents and manure for Rotterdam\u2019s flowerbeds. And at Blue City, a former indoor subtropical swimming complex has been repurposed to provide workspace for more than 30 startups working in the circular economy. \u201cWaste\u201d coffee granules from the Aloha Bar-Restaurant become soil for the mushrooms grown by a neighbouring startup; another is fashioning fruit peelings into leather. From 1 May, visitors wanting to immerse themselves in the city\u2019s vision can stay in one of Culture Campsite\u2019s spaces in the riverside Delfshaven district, with choices of upcycled \u201csleeping objects\u201d including a greenhouse, a silo and a cattle shelter. Although Rotterdam\u2019s main attractions tend to look to the future, it has not forgotten where its citizens came from. With around 180 nationalities calling the city home, it has a claim to be one of the most multicultural in the world. A great place to understand this richness is the Story House Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re. This community-run enterprise in the Katendrecht district is part-cafe, part-gallery and part-events space. Headphones lining the walls play recordings gathered from around Rotterdam, sharing the voices of the many cultures that give the city its character, and there are exhibitions by its annual immigrant artist in residence. Jeremy Smith Menorca Marine protection and sustainability to savour Menorcans realised early that a sustainable approach to tourism was essential for avoiding the overdevelopment that has spoiled so much of the Mediterranean coast in Spain. A Unesco biosphere reserve since 1993, the island has crystal-clear waters, a thriving local culture and unique gastronomy. The best way to access the white sandy beaches of the south and rocky coves of the north is via the Cam\u00ed de Cavalls, an ancient path for mounted soldiers connecting defensive lookouts that encircles the island. Thanks to pressure from a local NGO, it was reopened as a public right of way in 2010 and is now much-loved by Menorcans and visitors alike for walking, cycling or horse-riding. Since 2016, the Balearic Islands has collected a sustainable tourism tax and used it to fund local conservation initiatives such as the Underwater Atlas project, which maps the seagrass beds essential to the marine ecosystem so that they are not disturbed by boat anchors. Snorkelling around the coves to the east of Binimel-l\u00e0 beach you\u2019ll find waters bursting with life \u2013 look out for octopus and even the odd Moray eel. Last year, some 20 sq km of coastal waters was added to the existing Unesco biosphere reserve, making it the largest protected marine environment in the Mediterranean. The ferry from Barcelona arrives in the second largest town, Ciutadella, at the western end of the island. There, on 23-24 June each year, the Fiestas de Sant Joan brings parades of Menorcan horses, jousting and fireworks. Enjoy the festivities with a pomada \u2013 a mix of lemonade and distinctive Menorcan gin \u2013 legacy of a century of British rule. The British also left a taste for butter, which features in many local recipes. Stay at Ses Sucreres (doubles from \u20ac95 B&amp;B) in the pretty, whitewashed village of Ferreries in the centre of the island, and visit the homemade produce market in Pla\u00e7a Espanya, held on Saturday mornings, to sample the Mah\u00f3n-Menorca cheese, with its distinctive sharp, salty flavour. Seafood also plays a huge role in local cuisine \u2013 Es Cranc restaurant in the tiny northern port of Fornells is known for its outstanding caldereta (lobster stew). Menorca is currently in the running for European Region of Gastronomy 2022. Annette Pacey Copenhagen Carbon-neutral capital Shopping, sightseeing and museums are the mainstays of most city breaks. Copenhagen has all these \u2013 but where else could you go skiing in the city centre, or float in the clear water of open-air harbour baths? CopenHill, a huge new urban ski slope, was built atop a renewable waste-to-energy power plant. As well as skiing and snowboarding, it has running and hiking trails, and the world\u2019s highest outdoor climbing wall. For outdoor bathing, there are several options, such as the central Islands Brygge baths or the Nordhavn quarter, which has boardwalks, cafes and a beachy vibe. Real seaside isn\u2019t far from the city: Amager Beach Park is an easy 5km bike ride away and has miles of white sand, islands and a lagoon. Other activities in town include sailing in solar-powered GoBoats and kayaking. Copenhagen has pledged to become the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral capital by 2025. It is well on the way to reaching its goal, so is already a great place for a sustainable stay. It\u2019s one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world, so explore it on two wheels \u2013 there are many hire points, 375km of cycle tracks and several pedestrian/bike bridges over the harbour. Public transport is excellent, and expanding: the metro\u2019s new City Circle line now links the centre with the neighbourhoods of \u00d8sterbro, N\u00f8rrebro, Frederiksberg and Vesterbro, and another new line opens this year, connecting the northern harbour. Noma put the Copenhagen food scene on the map with its use of ultra-local ingredients and innovative takes on traditional techniques but there are plenty of other restaurants with great food and low carbon footprints. Gro Spiseri is a rooftop farm-cum-restaurant where diners eat in the greenhouses, and Baest has its own microdairy producing cheese from biodynamic Danish milk. More than two-thirds of the city\u2019s hotels hold an eco-certificate. One of the newest is the industrial-chic Hotel Ottilia (doubles from \u00a3120 B&amp;B), converted from two former brewery buildings in the emerging Carlsberg City district. It serves an organic breakfast, has a free \u201cwine hour\u201d from 5pm-6pm and the rooftop restaurant has views over the city. To get to Copenhagen from the UK without flying, take the Eurostar and onward trains to Brussels, Cologne or Hamburg, stay overnight, then continue to Copenhagen the next morning. (Stopping at one city on the way there and another on the way back adds to the fun.) Details at seat61.com Rachel Dixon Vienna Hikes, bikes \u2013 and affordable public transport Austria\u2019s capital and the \u201cworld\u2019s most livable city for 10 consecutive years\u201d, is surrounded by vineyards and woods, and dotted with gardens and parks, which together make up around 50% of the urban area. Former imperial parks are incorporated into the Lainz game reserve, the Lobau Unesco biosphere reserve in the Donau-Auen national park, and the well-known Prater park, whose grounds accompany a famed funfair. The city has 240km of signposted hiking trails through the Vienna Woods and other recreational areas, all accessible by public transport. The public rental bike system, Citybike Vienna, allows you to crisscross cobblestone streets to canalside avenues and sample the 300km of paths on the Wienerwald Cycle Route and the extensive Danube Cycle Path. The city has spent \u20ac8m on tree planting as part of initiatives to redesign parks and streets. Zieglergasse in the 7th district is Vienna\u2019s first climate-adapted street, completed in December 2019. With drinking fountains, cooling arches, garden and shaded areas, alongside more space for bikes, it has been dubbed the \u201cCool Mile\u201d. Nearby Neubaugasse, in the same district, will unveil a similar redesign in mid-January, for planned completion by autumn. Construction of a \u201cCooling Park\u201d in the adjacent 6th district\u2019s Esterh\u00e1zypark is due in spring 2020, and will include two \u201cclimate trees\u201d made of three-metre-high mist showers within an expanded shaded, green space. Urban gardening is common, on organic city farms and private allotments, aided by some of the city\u2019s 200 million bees in beehives atop the Vienna State Opera, the Burgtheater and the Old General Hospital. Some districts hold weekly local farmers\u2019 markets, although the main central markets of Naschmarkt, Karmelitermarkt and Brunnenmarkt at Yppenplatz all feature local vendors selling organic produce. Access to fresh mountain water is the norm, with 1,000 free drinking fountains throughout the city. Vienna is proud of its affordable and accessible transport system: the annual inner-city transport card costs \u20ac1 a day. With a focus on lowering car usage, the Friday Nightskating event invites people to take to the streets on skates and bikes, as a way to encourage people to see the city without noise or pollution. A push to get more people to use the extensive rail network is backed by Austria\u2019s train operator, OBB. The addition of services to Brussels and northern Romania, on top of routes to neighbouring countries, will establish Vienna as the best-connected city by rail in Europe in 2020. Becki Enright Romania Bears, bison and biodiversity You don\u2019t have to fly to southern Africa to go on safari \u2013 Romania is one of the best places in Europe to see large mammals in the wild. The country has seven million hectares of forests \u2013 a significant proportion is ancient virgin woodland \u2013 and is home to the continent\u2019s largest populations of brown bears, as well as wolves and lynx. Among organisations working to protect the wilderness is Foundation Conservation Carpathia (FCC), which has ambitious plans to create the largest forested national park in Europe. Focusing on restoring degraded forests and the wider ecosystem, FCC recently launched an ecotourism programme, including bear tracking. It has built four wildlife hides and trains specialised guides for one- and multi-day trips. FCC is also rolling out a four-year bison reintroduction programme in the region\u2019s F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 mountains, in partnership with the ProPark Foundation for Protected Areas and Conservation Capital. The first animals will be released into the wild this spring. Besides benefiting local communities through wildlife tourism, the reintroduction of bison \u2013 which disappeared from Romania 200 years ago \u2013 will also increase biodiversity. In a separate venture by Rewilding Europe and WWF Romania, the European commission-funded Life Bison project has already released 60 animals in Carpathia\u2019s Tarcu and Poiana Rusc\u0103 mountains, with more to come this year. Bison-tracking holidays in the area are offered by the European Safari Company (part of Rewilding Europe). A two-night experience costs from \u20ac299, including guiding and meals. The Bison Hillock Association, also involved in the project, offers a choice of trips, too, with hiking, cycling and homestay options. While the country faces issues with extensive illegal logging (two rangers were killed last autumn trying to protect the forests, and protesters took to the streets in November demanding more government action), ecotourism is increasing steadily. \u201cThere are challenges but ecotourism is growing organically here and lots of small-scale ethical businesses are opening, using local guides and produce, with the money staying in the community,\u201d said Andrei Blumer, president of the Association of Eco-Tourism in Romania. In the Danube Delta, new conservation projects include the reintroduction of water buffalo on Ermakov island. \u201cWe have amazing nature and wildlife and offer something unique in Europe,\u201d said Blumer. Jane Dunford Finland Native culture and natural beauty It may not come as a surprise that a country led by a 34-year-old female prime minister and an all-female coalition is also a world leader in progressive environmental policies. Among the Finnish coalition\u2019s key policies is a pledge to become a carbon-neutral country by 2035. Tourism is playing its part, with a rigorous sustainability policy that puts protection of the country\u2019s natural environment first. In Helsinki, where nature trails and clean coastal waters are part of the fabric of everyday life, more than 75% of hotel rooms are certified as environment-friendly. Some even feature a carbon calculator so guests can measure the impact of their stay and get tips on reducing it. The city\u2019s Think Sustainably initiative encourages attractions to use green energy sources, compensate visitor emissions and incorporate social responsibility into their business practise, through their recruitment policies and by donating part of their profits to good causes. The flagship and architecturally striking Art museum, Amos Rex, uses renewable energy supplier Ekos\u00e4hk\u00f6; while urban sauna Loyly \u2013 built from sustainably-sourced wood \u2013 serves organic food in its restaurant and plans to offer leftover meals for sale at a discount to cut back on waste. Helsinki is also at the forefront of responsible fashion with stores selling upcycled or secondhand clothes and several fashion \u201clibraries\u201d that have clothes for loan. But a commitment to protect nature \u2013 and people \u2013 runs the length and breadth of the country. In Utsjoki, the northernmost municipality, the 1,200-strong community is reinventing its tourism, after new regulations put an end to salmon fishing, once its largest source of income. Now Utsjoki is promoting its wilderness and Sami culture through mountain biking, kayaking, snow-shoeing and visiting the three villages to experience modern Sami culture, where reindeer husbandry is still a significant part of life. In the east, local company \u00c4ksyt \u00c4mm\u00e4t runs small-group tours of the forest, rivers and lakes of North Karelia. These are hosted by local guides and offer stays in small, family-run guesthouses: from a two-hour snow-shoeing tour through Koli national park (adults from \u20ac30; children \u20ac15) to a week on an island on Lake Saimaa (from \u20ac1,328pp) cross-country skiing and snow-shoeing and meeting villagers. In the autumn, Finland went a step further in its mission to create a tourism industry built on the long-term preservation of the environment, by introducing a tourism pledge, and encouraging visitors to not just enjoy nature but to \u201crespect and treasure\u201d it, too. Isabel Choat Portugal Making tourism a force for good Tourism has been a game-changer for Portugal, making Lisbon and, more recently, Porto into weekend hotspots with boutique hotels and hipster bars and restaurants. This has not been without a cost \u2013 one that\u2019s been borne primarily by local residents and businesses, who find themselves forced out of neighbourhoods by rising rents. Acknowledging that this growth was too rapid, the government is determined that a planned increase in visitor numbers will be managed sustainably, spreading tourism across the country \u2013 and the seasons \u2013 and putting local people first. It is three years into a 10-year sustainability strategy under which millions of euros has been invested in a variety of programmes aimed at boosting tourism beyond the honeypot destinations. One such programme is Revive, designed to breathe new life into abandoned or run-down heritage sites. One of the first \u2013 of 33 \u2013 to open was Vila Gal\u00e9, a former convent converted into a hotel in Elvas, a Unesco-listed but overlooked town near the Spanish border. A similar scheme, Revive Natura, will do the same for rural sites, such as former rangers\u2019 cottages. In the southern Alentejo, the largest artificial lake in Europe, Alqueva, was once ignored even by locals but is now a destination with water sports, beach areas, boutique hotels and a dark sky reserve. By 2027, 90% of tourism businesses will have to comply with rules governing water, waste and energy use, with help from government funding. Underpinning it all is a commitment to turn tourism into a force for good. A recent study found that just 30% of people in major cities are happy with tourism; the goal is to increase that to 90% by 2027. Isabel Choat * * * UK Salford Europe\u2019s biggest gardening project More than 700 volunteer gardeners have been busy in Salford, removing invasive species from a 154-acre site and planting more welcome ones, including 40,000 crocus bulbs for a dazzling spring display. They are not toiling alone: a small herd of rare-breed pigs has been clearing brambles and digging over the soil. Oh, and there are quite a few professional gardeners on board, too. This is the new RHS Garden Bridgewater, the biggest gardening project in Europe. The \u00a330m-plus site is due to open this summer on the site of Worsley New Hall, a 19th-century mansion on the edge of the city that was demolished in the 1940s. It is the RHS\u2019s first new garden in 17 years and first urban garden, it has been designed by landscape architect Tom Stuart-Smith. A million annual visitors are expected to generate \u00a313.8m a year for the local economy by 2029, with 140 jobs in the garden itself and 180 more in the surrounding area. Community is at the heart of this garden. Richard Green, the head of Bridgewater, says: \u201cThere is no other garden like this in the north-west of England, not on this scale. It is a mix of stunning horticulture and a place for people.\u201d As well as the green-fingered volunteers, GPs are already referring patients to the garden through a \u201csocial prescribing\u201d pilot scheme, whereby people struggling with isolation, mobility problems and other conditions are prescribed activities such as gardening. A dedicated therapeutic gardener, Ozichi Brewster, leads this programme, which has so far helped 40 people. Patients can plant hanging baskets, make bug hotels, go on woodland walks or join tai chi and yoga sessions in the wellbeing garden, a hub for community organisations such as dementia support groups and veterans. Young people have also been helping in the garden under the National Citizen Service. Soon there will be classrooms and a learning garden \u2013 about 7,000 local schoolchildren will be invited every year \u2013 and apprenticeship schemes. Adults can garden in community allotments in the walled garden; four of the plots will be dedicated to growing produce for a local food bank. There are also demonstration areas to inspire visitors to transform their own gardens. Other prominent features include a kitchen garden, providing fruit and vegetables for the cafe; a Chinese garden created with Greater Manchester\u2019s Chinese community; and a calming \u201cparadise garden\u201d with a huge pond. A wild woodland play area with hobbit holes, a bug garden and a low ropes course is designed to help children of all ages get outside, connect with nature and socialise away from screens. Those who can\u2019t wait for the official opening in the summer can book a two-hour guided tour (\u00a35, until April). Or why not join the green army? The garden is recruiting now for its next batch of volunteers. Opens summer 2020. Free entry for RHS members, and for Salford residents every Tuesday for the first year. Everyone else can have two free visits a year. \u2022 rhs.org.uk Rachel Dixon Cairngorms Ambitious habitat restoration project It\u2019s easy to presume that the Cairngorms national park, with its ancient woodlands, peat bogs, untamed rivers and forbidding mountains, is faring well when it comes to conservation. But in fact, much of its native flora and fauna has been damaged by hundreds of years of poor management and a burgeoning deer population. One organisation is now helping turn the tide by putting together the most ambitious vision for habitat restoration Britain has ever seen. Cairngorms Connect is a collaborative habitat restoration project launched in 2019, with funding from Endangered Landscapes Programme, covering 600 sq km (13% of the Cairngorms national park). The area contains some of the UK\u2019s most prized ecosystems \u2013 from its only sub-Arctic montane plateau to forests that are home to pine martens, wild cats, eagles, capercaillie and rare tooth-fungi. Committing to an ecological timeframe of 200 years (there\u2019s no room for a short-term mentality here), neighbouring land managers \u2014 including Wildland, RSPB Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry and Land Scotland \u2014 will work together to restore native woodlands, peatlands, wetlands and rivers. In 2020, visitors will get a better sense of the project thanks to a newly refurbished visitor centre, interpretive walks and volunteering opportunities. Since 1959, when it was just a caravan parked on borrowed land, the Loch Garten Osprey Centre in Abernethy has grown into the RSPB\u2019s second-largest and most diverse reserve, home to more than 5,000 species. Thanks to funding from European Structural Funds, the centre will in 2020 be renamed and refurbished with improved access, and open for eight months of the year: the Loch Garten Nature Centre will help explain Cairngorms Connect as part of a wider conservation story. Beyond the centre, interpretive walks will be added to the Big Pines and Two Lochs trails to enhance understanding of the UK\u2019s largest single remnant of ancient Caledonian pinewood. While Cairngorms Connect\u2019s focus for 2020 is getting local communities involved, visitors will get a look-in, too. Volunteers can join one-day projects from seed collecting to planting (once live, opportunities will be advertised on the Cairngorms Connect website). Rewilding tour operator Scotland: The Big Picture has launched a four-day Wilderness Weekend: Cairngorms Connect (15-18 May, from \u00a3765pp), which takes visitors on a conservation-oriented journey through the diverse landscapes. Also opening in the region next year, as part of the Cairngorms national park\u2019s net zero by 2045 vision, is a Speyside Way extension and a Strathspey electric bike project. Holly Tuppen Davagh Dark Sky Observatory Stargazing in the Sperrin mountains, County Tyrone The Sperrin mountains, which straddle the counties of Derry and Tyrone, are often overlooked by visitors heading for the Giant\u2019s Causeway on the Antrim coast, or various Game of Thrones locations. But the Sperrins are \u201cUlster\u2019s wildest land\u201d, according to Irish poet Mary Montague. \u201cThe thickest sheets of the last ice age scoured these mountains into smooth undulations that banner the skyline. But don\u2019t be fooled by gentle curves \u2013 the Sperrins\u2019 heart is vastly bleak,\u201d she says. The Sperrins area of outstanding natural beauty is a wild, untouched landscape of moorland and forest, punctuated with tarns and bogs. It also offers rare unspoiled views of the night sky. A scatter of neolithic monuments, such as the Beaghmore stone circle, bear testament to the fact that the constellations have long held sway over these parts. In April, Northern Ireland\u2019s first dark sky observatory will open in Davagh Forest, giving visitors the opportunity to experience the night sky away from light pollution. This dense woodland, with miles of moss-covered conifers, has a fairytale quality, with sika deer roaming free and the odd sighting of rare pine martens. It sits in a small valley formed by the Davagh Water, one of the headstreams of the Owenreagh River, and is popular with hikers and mountain bikers. But the \u00a31.2m Dark Sky Park will focus attention upwards, with a telescope trained on the solar system through a retractable roof. A series of audio-visual shows with maps of the solar system will be specially created for night-time events and screened on to the buildings: visitors can watch from a viewing platform, and explore the universe via holographic installations and virtual reality headsets. There will also be exhibitions linking the landscape with the archaeological and astronomical heritage of the Sperrins, as well as a play planetarium for children. And for those who want to extend their stay and sleep under the stars, like the ancients, five glamping pods are being built alongside the centre (from \u00a3100 a night for four people, sperrinviewglamping.com). Andy Pietrasik Isle of Wight Futuristic retro The Isle of Wight has long charmed holidaymakers with its retro seaside fun, 500-plus miles of footpaths and historic buildings such as Osborne House. Despite being visible from the mainland, this small, diamond-shaped island often feels worlds away, partly thanks to its unique relationship with nature. In 1963, half of the island was designated an area of outstanding natural beauty, and in 2013 it created its first wildlife superhighways. Last June, it stuck its eco neck out a little further by becoming the UK\u2019s seventh Unesco biosphere reserve. A biosphere reserve is not merely a landscape that\u2019s been put aside for nature, but a place where communities have learned to live alongside natural habitats. The Isle of Wight has been awarded the accolade thanks to its rare wildlife \u2014 red squirrels in the woodlands, Glanville fritillaries on chalky cliffs, and the Ventnor wall lizard on sunny, beachfront walls \u2014 and sustainable economic development. Collaboration between environmental organisations, charities, councils and local volunteers is improving the island for locals, visitors and nature alike. The Common Space, a non-profit, is working with local volunteers to revitalise the Bay area in the east of the island; a 2020 calendar of events includes British Science Week (6-15 March), when pop-up laboratories will showcase natural wonders from pond life to fossils. In Sandown on the south coast, Browns Golf Course is getting a wildlife makeover thanks to a new footpath linking a previously overgrown woodland walk and reedbed wetland. Via the Lost Duver Project, the council and community are also restoring former dune stacks in Sandown by replanting native coastal flora such as ragged-robin and thrift. From a commitment to green building (Tom\u2019s Eco Lodge is powered by a solar field and biomass boiler) to supporting rewilding initiatives (Tiny Homes\u2019 wildflower meadows), tourism is very much part of the island\u2019s biosphere fame. Also launched in 2019, Visit Isle of Wight\u2019s Slow Travel Guide encourages visitors to leave cars at home, with eight car-free touring routes via bus, rail, bike or footpath. The island\u2019s sustainable travel scheme also allows accommodation owners with the highest green ratings, including Nettlecombe Farm (from \u00a3370 for four people per week) and Seaview Hotel (from \u00a395), to offer guests free bus travel. Holly Tuppen * * * Rest of the world Fukushima The Recovery Olympics in Japan The Tokyo Olympic Games of 1964 became a symbol of Japan\u2019s economic rebirth after the second world war, when visitors were dazzled by the country\u2019s ambition. This time around, the organisers of Tokyo 2020 are hoping the games will signal the regeneration of the Tohoku region, which was devastated by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and open up a lesser-known part of the country to visitors. The games are billed as the Recovery Olympics, and the Olympic torch - made of aluminium recycled from the temporary shelters used to house 500,000 displaced people \u2013 will begin its relay at the J-Village football stadium, just outside the 30km exclusion zone of the crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, before moving through the neighbouring prefectures of Miyagi and Iwate, also affected in 2011. The J-Village and Azuma baseball stadium in Fukushima City will host baseball, softball and football matches in the summer. Almost a decade after the disaster this is not an exercise in dark tourism \u2013 though one operator has started running Chernobyl-style tours of the Fukushima exclusion zone. Rather, it is an opportunity to discover a more authentic side of Japan \u2013 away from the tourist-thronged shrines and temples of Kyoto. The bullet train delivers passengers from Tokyo at warp speed \u2013 actually 90 minutes, though it feels like travelling back in time from the frenzy of the 21st-century capital \u2013 to what Richard Lloyd Parry describes in his book Ghosts of the Tsunami as a \u201cslower, gentler\u201d arcadia of mountains, lakes, rivers and \u201cfields rich in grain and fruit\u201d. (Tohoku is famous for its high-quality rice, peaches, grapes, Kitakata ramen and sake \u2013 though producers have struggled to overcome fears about contaminated food, despite it being exported once more.) Aizu, in the west of Fukushima, is steeped in the history of the samurai, the hard men of the north, but it is also famous for its delicately detailed lacquerware dating back to the 16th century and flourishing in the Edo era (17th-19th centuries). Onsen villages, such as Tsuchiyu, have sprouted around hot springs in the mountains, and to the north, often wreathed in wisps of low-lying cloud like a Hokusai print, lies magnificent Mount Bandai. This conical volcano in the Bandai-Asahi national park is surrounded by lakes, including the vividly cobalt pools of Goshiki-numa. When Olympian Tom Daley visited the region last summer, he stayed at the charming Bandai Lakeside Guesthouse and performed frontflips and backflips on the jetty by Lake Sohara. The ultimate irony is that this Lake District of Japan was formed by another natural disaster \u2013 when Mount Bandai blew its top in 1888. Andy Pietrasik Montana Creating a vast nature reserve Tens of millions of bison once thrived on the great plains of north America but by the late 1800s they had almost disappeared. Now the near-threatened species is grazing once again. Some 20,000 now live in America, mostly in small, often fenced-in, herds. But on the high plains of north-east Montana more than 800 beasts roam free. The conservation of this herd (or obstinacy) is just one of many wildlife projects run by American Prairie Reserve (APR), a non-profit that aims to preserve vast tracts of wilderness. Using a similar model to the Tompkins Foundation in Chilean Patagonia, the APR makes strategic purchases of private land that it uses to stitch together tracts of existing public land. Since it started in 2004, APR has bought over 100,000 acres, which has been joined with public land to form 419,000 acres of rolling hills and grassy plateaux drained by the Missouri River. The goal is to form a prairie area of roughly 3.2 million acres, complete with migration corridors \u2013 the largest nature reserve in the continental US. The APR\u2019s activities have upset local ranchers and farmers. But founder Sean Gerrity, who made his fortune in Silicon Valley, is determined to create a vast ecosystem where wildlife large and small can roam free. As well as bison, it runs projects to protect habitats and increase populations of at-risk animals, including prairie dogs, cougars, pronghorns (endemic deer) and grassland birds. With no fences, the freedom-to-roam philosophy applies to visitors, too. It\u2019s possible to walk, cycle or canoe for miles and see nothing manmade, except the odd signpost. Small-scale accommodation options include two campsites (from $15) with RV hookups; a safari-style lodge; and two pairs of large yurts \u2013 Founders Hut and John and Margaret Craighead Hut \u2013 each connected by a hallway and accommodating nine people in four bunk rooms. A third \u201chut\u201d is due to open this year. Under big Montana skies, visitors can wake up to scenery that has barely changed in centuries, and that will be protected for generations to come. Isabel Choat Vancouver Birthplace of Greenpeace grows greener Vancouver calls itself a 20-minute city: it takes 20 minutes to get to the beach, the mountains and the airport. But green space is not in short supply either. Downtown Stanley Park is bigger than Central Park in New York, and is surrounded by water on three sides. Visitors can cycle around it along part of the Seawall, a 28km path around the city\u2019s waterfront. Nearby Vanier Park is a summer hotspot, with its Bard on the Beach Shakespeare festival and big attractions such as the Museum of Vancouver. A little further out, the Pacific Spirit regional park has a network of hiking routes in 1,850 acres of forest, while North Shore is the place to head for legendary mountain biking trails. Now, Vancouver\u2019s Greenest City Action Plan aims to drastically reduce carbon emissions, with 122,000 new trees planted since 2010. It is a fitting initiative for the birthplace of Greenpeace (the environmental group was founded here in 1971) and Vancouver continues to raise the bar: last month, the world\u2019s first fully electric commercial aircraft took off from here, raising hopes of a new, guilt-free \u201celectric aviation age\u201d. The 100-mile diet \u2013 eating only food grown within 100 miles of your home \u2013originated in Vancouver in 2005. Restaurants that have embraced this include Forage, whose executive chef hunts, fishes and keeps bees; Chambar, which has been carbon-neutral since 2011; the Acorn, an award-winning \u201cvegetable-forward\u201d restaurant; and Edible Canada, which promotes sustainable, seasonal food and stocks an enormous range of Canadian produce for diners to take home. The central Listel hotel (doubles from \u00a390), has a five-Green Key eco-rating and is full of original work by Canadian artists. Rachel Dixon Sri Lanka Sustainable recovery after terror attack In the past 10 years, Sri Lanka has flourished as a tourist destination. Opening up to visitors since the end of the civil war has meant a growth in accommodation, from tea plantation bungalows and surfer hostels to mountain-view hotels and treehouses among the lush lowland rainforests. The number of tour companies has also increased, with more of them travelling to remote, lesser-visited regions such as the national parks of Gal Oya and Wilpattu, and the coastal areas of Kalpitiya and Kalkudah, benefiting smaller businesses including tuk-tuk drivers, souvenir sellers and family-run restaurants. The country\u2019s thriving tourism industry came to a halt with the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019. Visitor numbers were down 71% year-on-year to May, and 57% to June. And according to figuress presented to the Foreign Office by British-based tour operators, up to 80% of hotel bookings were cancelled. In recent months, arrivals have been creeping up, particularly since most countries relaxed their travel restrictions, including the UK in June. Overall, however, figures are still down almost 20% \u2013 which is significant for the millions of people in Sri Lanka who rely on tourism, directly and indirectly. As the country looks ahead, there are projects to be celebrated. The Sri Lanka Ecotourism Foundation, running since 1998, supports social and economic development of rural communities. Its work ranges from renewable energy projects, such as small-scale wind-solar farm training programmes, to empowering women through ecotourism roles, including a new lagoon-side campsite and activity centre, the Hikkaduwa Women-Centric Ecotourism Project. It also launched a new national sustainable tourism certification for hotels in April 2019. Beyond this, there are compelling sustainability and community-based tourism projects all over the country. Mangrove replanting has been taking place since the 2004 tsunami \u2013 including at Kitesurfing Lanka in Kalpitiya. Mangroves are not only an effective defence against the sea, but also help boost wildlife and act as long-term carbon sinks. Waste Less Arugam Bay is a partnership aiming to educate tourists and local communities about plastic \u2013 through, for example, reliable waste collection, creating souvenirs from recycled plastic, and providing water bottle refills. Fairtrade homeware and clothing brand Selyn uses a female-led workforce, traditional techniques and maintains a cottage industry via regional producers, which welcome visitors. Joining local families in the lesser-travelled inland part of Tangalle in the south, Experience Travel runs tours to support rural crafts and practices, such as producers of handcrafted buffalo curd, served as a delicious sweet dessert in clay pots called mee-kiri, topped with sticky kithul palm syrup. Antonia Wilson Chilean Patagonia Community tourism begins on new Route of Parks Few countries on Earth have allocated more land for environmental protection in recent years than Chile, which in 2018 set aside 10 million acres of Patagonia to be preserved in five national parks. This was due in no small part to the conservation work of American philanthropist Kristine McDivitt Tompkins (ex-CEO of outdoors company Patagonia) and her late husband Doug (co-founder of North Face), who donated a large chunk of the land. In 2020, it will be easier than ever to visit these remote reserves, thanks to the new Route of Parks. Launched last year, the route consolidates a haphazard tourist circuit spanning 1,700 miles (and 17 national parks), from the volcano-dotted forests of Chile\u2019s Lake District to the fjords at the southern tip of the continent. Locals in the 60 communities along the route have responded to the Tompkins\u2019 vision by taking ownership of the wilderness and starting tourism projects that will help protect the parks in the long term (as well as create sustainable incomes). Chait\u00e9n-based Ruta Patagonia 7 runs tours along the famed Carretera Austral (Southern Highway) to the newly designated Pumal\u00edn national park, a rainforest reserve in remote northern Patagonia. Further south, Patagonian Fjords has opened up the previously inaccessible \u2013 and newly created \u2013 Kaw\u00e9sqar national park to tourism for the first time, with trips through its fog-draped fjords departing from the resort town of Puerto Natales. New hotels have also popped up along the route, including Estancia Caleta Josefina (rooms from \u00a3135), on a sheep farm in Tierra del Fuego. And in 2018 Patagonia national park (home to one of the most ambitious rewilding efforts in the Americas) opened a new museum, Patagonia Park Museum, which explores local history and the current extinction crisis. Another museum dedicated to the Anglo-Argentine pioneer Lucas Bridges (author of Uttermost Part of the Earth, the 1947 landmark book on Tierra del Fuego) will open here in 2020. Connectivity, long a barrier to regional development, has improved alongside the new route. There is no land connection between the northern and southern sections of Chilean Patagonia, but a ferry service now links the end of the Carretera Austral with Puerto Natales, making it easier for tourists to travel along a unified path without detouring into Argentina. A road under construction in a remote stretch of Tierra del Fuego will finally open up little-visited Yendegaia national park, which protects the ice fields of the Cordillera Darwin mountain range.

      "body": "<h2><strong>The clinical psychologist: \u2018</strong><strong>In a family you need a buffer zone for defusing difficult situations\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Dr Cathy Burges </em><em>works with </em><em>child and </em><em>adolescent </em><em>mental </em><em>health </em><em>services embedded in </em><em>youth </em><em>offending </em><em>teams in Berkshire</em><br>I don\u2019t know whether it comes from seeing some very challenging and disturbing situations at work, but I think I\u2019m reasonably relaxed as a parent. There have been times when my teens have done something that I would think is normal \u2013 like staying out too late or having a drink \u2013 but other parents have reacted very strongly. I feel that young people should be able to make mistakes safely. It helps them become stronger adults.</p> <p>Being a parent has undoubtedly helped me be better at my job. And working with troubled young people has certainly helped my parenting. I started my career when my oldest child was one, so my parenting has grown with my clinical practice; my children are now 19, 18, 16 and 13.</p> <p>Lots of my young clients have had awful experiences \u2013 family breakup is just one \u2013 and, being teens, their brains aren\u2019t fully developed so they\u2019re more likely to feel things more keenly. My tactic is to ask myself: what is the function of that behaviour? Take an offender who might have been carrying a knife: when you dig down and find the reason, you begin to understand that maybe they\u2019ve been held at gunpoint [and felt they had to protect themselves]. I do ask myself that question with my own kids. Hopefully, they don\u2019t think I\u2019m analysing them.</p> <p>I have an office at home, which is great for defusing difficult situations. My children might say, \u201cMum, can I have a chat in your office please?\u201d It\u2019s a buffer zone, and you do need one in a family. </p> <h2><strong>The dentist: \u2018I</strong><strong>\u2019m happy for them to eat sugary treats at mealtimes, but fizzy drinks are banned\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Charlotte Waite </em><em>chairs the British Dental Association England Community Dental Services Committee </em><br>I work with children with additional needs; they\u2019re referred to me because they might have difficulty seeing a dentist because of anxiety or disabilities.</p> <p>My own girls are now nine and 11, and having them has made me a better dentist, especially when it comes to communication, not only with my patients, but also their parents. Sometimes it\u2019s actually the parents who are very anxious. I can see a clear correlation between the parents\u2019 anxiety and issues their child has. There\u2019s lots of research to back that up. It\u2019s made me very conscious of projecting my own anxieties on to my children.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lollies and rock are awful. It\u2019s the prolonged contact with sugar on the teeth that is a real problem</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I still supervise both my girls brushing their teeth. I\u2019m happy for them to eat some sweets and sugary treats, but only at mealtimes, and all fizzy drinks are banned. I don\u2019t like them having anything too acidic, and lollies and rock are awful. It\u2019s the prolonged contact with sugar on the teeth that is a real problem.</p> <p>I am afraid I\u2019m obsessed with children falling and breaking their teeth. If one of mine falls, it\u2019s all about, \u201cOK, nice bruise \u2013 show me your teeth!\u201d I speak from experience \u2013 I fell and broke my own front teeth when I was 11. It was traumatic and impacted on my future career choice because it made me realise how important it is that children get really good, sensitive dental care.</p> <h2><strong>The dietician: \u2018Breastfeeding was far from the magical experience I\u2019d expected\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Bini Sureshbabu </em><em>manages paediatric and adult services for the North East London Foundation Trust</em><em> </em><br>I\u2019ve always known that breastfeeding is best for a baby, so with Alyssa, who is three, I was adamant I\u2019d do it for six months: but she got jaundice, lost 20% of her body weight in her first week, and ended up on formula. After that, I struggled: it was painful, I didn\u2019t enjoy it, and it was far from the magical experience I\u2019d expected it to be. In the end I stopped at around three months; and these days I\u2019d tell patients to aim for six months, but that the most important thing is to look after yourself.</p> <p>When I was a child we weren\u2019t allowed to leave the table until we\u2019d finished our meal; but now we know that can make children into fussy eaters. All the same, I\u2019ve sometimes shocked myself by saying things designed to guilt trip my children into eating: \u201cThere are children in the world who don\u2019t get the food you get!\u201d</p> <p>The thing about children and food is that it\u2019s so easy to let your anxiety get the better of you. For example, I know the right thing to do with a child who\u2019s being fussy about food is to offer a meal, give them time to eat it and not offer an alternative if it\u2019s not eaten. But there have been times when Alyssa has refused food and I\u2019ve gone to find alternatives. With Reeve, who is one, I don\u2019t do that.</p> <p>Another mistake I made with Alyssa was to try to avoid a mess when she was eating: I\u2019d cover her in a bib, and wipe her hands if they got food on them. But children need to explore and have fun with food.</p> <h2><strong>The children\u2019s counsellor: \u2018When they do tests at school, don\u2019t ask: \u201cWhat did so-and-so get?\u201d\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Laura Campbell is </em><em>employed by The Spark, which provides school-based counselling in Scotland</em><br>Like many parents, I\u2019ve often made flippant remarks to my children \u2013 Lewis, nine and Carrie, five \u2013 to get them to do things. Then later, when I\u2019ve been in a counselling situation, I\u2019ve realised how much children take things to heart. Sometimes I\u2019ve come home and apologised to my own kids as a result. One little boy told me he was frightened because his mum had told him he\u2019d be taken away if he didn\u2019t behave \u2013 and I realised I\u2019d said to my son, a similar age, that if he wasn\u2019t well behaved, a mythical Scottish figure called Maggie Murphy might come to get him.

So when they do tests at school, don\u2019t ask, \u201cWhat did so-and-so get?\u201d because you\u2019re setting them up to feel that impossible things are expected of them, which is very damaging.

Then we wrote down all the other jobs he could do that are connected with football: manager; coach; sports therapist; trainer.

      "bodyText": "The clinical psychologist: \u2018In a family you need a buffer zone for defusing difficult situations\u2019 Dr Cathy Burges works with child and adolescent mental health services embedded in youth offending teams in Berkshire I don\u2019t know whether it comes from seeing some very challenging and disturbing situations at work, but I think I\u2019m reasonably relaxed as a parent. There have been times when my teens have done something that I would think is normal \u2013 like staying out too late or having a drink \u2013 but other parents have reacted very strongly. I feel that young people should be able to make mistakes safely. It helps them become stronger adults. Being a parent has undoubtedly helped me be better at my job. And working with troubled young people has certainly helped my parenting. I started my career when my oldest child was one, so my parenting has grown with my clinical practice; my children are now 19, 18, 16 and 13. Lots of my young clients have had awful experiences \u2013 family breakup is just one \u2013 and, being teens, their brains aren\u2019t fully developed so they\u2019re more likely to feel things more keenly. My tactic is to ask myself: what is the function of that behaviour? Take an offender who might have been carrying a knife: when you dig down and find the reason, you begin to understand that maybe they\u2019ve been held at gunpoint [and felt they had to protect themselves]. I do ask myself that question with my own kids. Hopefully, they don\u2019t think I\u2019m analysing them. I have an office at home, which is great for defusing difficult situations. My children might say, \u201cMum, can I have a chat in your office please?\u201d It\u2019s a buffer zone, and you do need one in a family. The dentist: \u2018I\u2019m happy for them to eat sugary treats at mealtimes, but fizzy drinks are banned\u2019 Charlotte Waite chairs the British Dental Association England Community Dental Services Committee I work with children with additional needs; they\u2019re referred to me because they might have difficulty seeing a dentist because of anxiety or disabilities. My own girls are now nine and 11, and having them has made me a better dentist, especially when it comes to communication, not only with my patients, but also their parents. Sometimes it\u2019s actually the parents who are very anxious. I can see a clear correlation between the parents\u2019 anxiety and issues their child has. There\u2019s lots of research to back that up. It\u2019s made me very conscious of projecting my own anxieties on to my children. I still supervise both my girls brushing their teeth. I\u2019m happy for them to eat some sweets and sugary treats, but only at mealtimes, and all fizzy drinks are banned. I don\u2019t like them having anything too acidic, and lollies and rock are awful. It\u2019s the prolonged contact with sugar on the teeth that is a real problem. I am afraid I\u2019m obsessed with children falling and breaking their teeth. If one of mine falls, it\u2019s all about, \u201cOK, nice bruise \u2013 show me your teeth!\u201d I speak from experience \u2013 I fell and broke my own front teeth when I was 11. It was traumatic and impacted on my future career choice because it made me realise how important it is that children get really good, sensitive dental care. The dietician: \u2018Breastfeeding was far from the magical experience I\u2019d expected\u2019 Bini Sureshbabu manages paediatric and adult services for the North East London Foundation Trust I\u2019ve always known that breastfeeding is best for a baby, so with Alyssa, who is three, I was adamant I\u2019d do it for six months: but she got jaundice, lost 20% of her body weight in her first week, and ended up on formula. After that, I struggled: it was painful, I didn\u2019t enjoy it, and it was far from the magical experience I\u2019d expected it to be. In the end I stopped at around three months; and these days I\u2019d tell patients to aim for six months, but that the most important thing is to look after yourself. When I was a child we weren\u2019t allowed to leave the table until we\u2019d finished our meal; but now we know that can make children into fussy eaters. All the same, I\u2019ve sometimes shocked myself by saying things designed to guilt trip my children into eating: \u201cThere are children in the world who don\u2019t get the food you get!\u201d The thing about children and food is that it\u2019s so easy to let your anxiety get the better of you. For example, I know the right thing to do with a child who\u2019s being fussy about food is to offer a meal, give them time to eat it and not offer an alternative if it\u2019s not eaten. But there have been times when Alyssa has refused food and I\u2019ve gone to find alternatives. With Reeve, who is one, I don\u2019t do that. Another mistake I made with Alyssa was to try to avoid a mess when she was eating: I\u2019d cover her in a bib, and wipe her hands if they got food on them. But children need to explore and have fun with food. The children\u2019s counsellor: \u2018When they do tests at school, don\u2019t ask: \u201cWhat did so-and-so get?\u201d\u2019 Laura Campbell is employed by The Spark, which provides school-based counselling in Scotland Like many parents, I\u2019ve often made flippant remarks to my children \u2013 Lewis, nine and Carrie, five \u2013 to get them to do things.

      "bodyText": "Gavin on Rob What were you hoping for? The love of my life. Failing that, good food and good company. First impressions? An impressive beard. What did you talk about? Work, holidays, yoga, snowboarding, Rob\u2019s voluntary work, politics (unfortunately), going out and dating in London. Any awkward moments? The staff at the restaurant brought some complementary dishes for us to try. Rob is vegetarian, so I ended up eating more than my fair share. Good table manners? Very good. Best thing about Rob? He was good company and easy to talk to. There were no awkward silences. Would you introduce him to your friends? Yes. Describe Rob in three words? Warm, calm, kind. What do you think he made of you? Hopefully, he thought I was good company and worth coming out on a Sunday night for. Did you go on somewhere? It was a Sunday evening, so we were both happy to call it a night after the meal. And... did you kiss? No. We hugged and said our goodbyes. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Although we had similar political leanings, politics is rarely a good topic of conversation on a first date. Marks out of 10? 7. Would you meet again? I would as friends. Rob said he might come to check out my ice-cream shop. Rob on Gavin What were you hoping for? A stress-free evening with someone who was easy to be around. First impressions?

To be honest, I was more interested in looking at his face and his arms. Best thing about Gavin? He was the full package. Handsome, lovely figure, great smell. And he shows genuine interest in other people. Would you introduce him to your friends? Of course. Describe Gavin in three words Interesting, humble, gorgeous. What do you think he made of you? I think he thought I was a nice and well-meaning person. Did you go on somewhere? No. And... did you kiss? I would have quite happily spent the evening kissing him, but I didn\u2019t feel the date was going in that direction. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?

Donald Trump\u2019s Friday launch of his so-called \u201ccoalition of evangelicals\u201d, an attempt to shore up the support of the religious right ahead of November\u2019s election, had the feel of any other campaign rally, except this time with gospel music.</p> <p>An estimated 7,000 \u201csupporters of faith\u201d packed the King Jesus international ministry megachurch in Miami to hear the word of the president, and decided that it was good. The Maga hat-wearing faithful cheered Trump\u2019s comments on issues calculated to resonate with his churchgoing audience, including abortion, freedoms of speech and religion, and what he claimed was a \u201ccrusade\u201d from Democrats against religious tolerance.</p> <p>\u201cMy administration will never stop fighting for Americans of faith,\u201d Trump said at the conclusion of an often freewheeling 75-minute speech. \u201cWe will restore the faith as the true foundation of American life.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also gloated about Thursday\u2019s military strike that took out the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad. \u201cIt was flawless strike that eliminated the terrorist ringleader,\u201d he said, insisting the killing would save the lives of \u201chundreds and hundreds of Americans.</p> <p>\u201cHis atrocities have been stopped for good. He was planning a very major attack and we got him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4787bf801848900422b59f692a880bbd795772d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4787bf801848900422b59f692a880bbd795772d/0_350_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I really believe we have God on our side,\u2019 Trump said Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I really believe we have God on our side,\u2019 Trump said Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Absent from his remarks, however, was any discussion of one of his signature policies, the hardline crackdown on immigration that has seen thousands of undocumented migrants deported.</p> <p>At this Hispanic megachurch, where even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/30/miami-trump-rally-undocumented-immigrants\">the pastor acknowledges</a> many in his congregation are in the country illegally, perhaps that was no surprise. Trump did concede he had made it harder for foreigners to enter or stay in the US, but only to \u201cmake sure foreign terrorists cannot obtain admission\u201d.</p> <p>It was exactly what evangelical Christians in the audience wanted to hear. Some, like Michael David Layne, a 62-year-old US army veteran who regularly attends the King Jesus church, marries what he sees as Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong leadership\u201d with \u201csolid Christian values\u201d, which he said the president showed in Thursday\u2019s military strike. \u201cWe can get anybody, anywhere, anytime, anywhere there is terrorism,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Layne acknowledges that Trump\u2019s life \u2013 which includes three marriages, adultery and alleged affairs with porn stars \u2013 might appear less than pious, but is able to overlook it. \u201cHe might be a little rough around the edges for some people, but he says it like it is, and if some of the things he says or the actions he takes upset some people it doesn\u2019t make him less of a man of God.\u201d</p> <p>Others who came to hear Trump preach were similarly unfazed by the president\u2019s questionable religious credentials.</p> <p>\u201cI believe he has moral character and that he is a man of God,\u201d said Steven Johnson, 65, from New Jersey. \u201cI also believe that he believes people have to pick up the banner and do what\u2019s right.

We\u2019ve gone way off the deep end.\u201d</p> <p>The need for some kind of national restoration of faith was a topic Trump returned to more than once.</p> <p>\u201cFor America to thrive in the 21st century we must renew faith and family as the center of American life,\u201d the president said during one plainly scripted part of his speech.</p> <p>\u201cFaith-based schools, charities, hospitals, adoption agencies, pastors were systematically targeted by federal bureaucrats and ordered to stop following their beliefs,\u201d he said, without evidence.</p> <p>Friday\u2019s rally, hastily organized in the wake of a stinging <a href=\"https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/december-web-only/trump-should-be-removed-from-office.html\">Christianity Today editorial</a> last month, recognized Trump\u2019s need to retain the loyalty of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/30/miami-trump-rally-undocumented-immigrants\">evangelical voting bloc</a> that propelled him to victory in 2016. Four years ago, he won 80% backing from white evangelical voters nationwide.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2016 evangelical Christians went out and helped us in numbers never seen before. We\u2019re going to blow those numbers away in 2020,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI really believe we have God on our side.\u201d</p> <p>For Rose Ann Farrell, 74, from Florida, the claim rang true. \u201cI really believe he was sent to us,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom one to ten, he\u2019s a ten. He lives in a Christian world and we needed a strong Christian, somebody who is not afraid. He speaks for us, has the guts and courage to speak what we want to say.

Donald Trump\u2019s Friday launch of his so-called \u201ccoalition of evangelicals\u201d, an attempt to shore up the support of the religious right ahead of November\u2019s election, had the feel of any other campaign rally, except this time with gospel music. An estimated 7,000 \u201csupporters of faith\u201d packed the King Jesus international ministry megachurch in Miami to hear the word of the president, and decided that it was good. The Maga hat-wearing faithful cheered Trump\u2019s comments on issues calculated to resonate with his churchgoing audience, including abortion, freedoms of speech and religion, and what he claimed was a \u201ccrusade\u201d from Democrats against religious tolerance. \u201cMy administration will never stop fighting for Americans of faith,\u201d Trump said at the conclusion of an often freewheeling 75-minute speech. \u201cWe will restore the faith as the true foundation of American life.\u201d Trump also gloated about Thursday\u2019s military strike that took out the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad. \u201cIt was flawless strike that eliminated the terrorist ringleader,\u201d he said, insisting the killing would save the lives of \u201chundreds and hundreds of Americans. \u201cHis atrocities have been stopped for good. He was planning a very major attack and we got him.\u201d Absent from his remarks, however, was any discussion of one of his signature policies, the hardline crackdown on immigration that has seen thousands of undocumented migrants deported. At this Hispanic megachurch, where even the pastor acknowledges many in his congregation are in the country illegally, perhaps that was no surprise. Trump did concede he had made it harder for foreigners to enter or stay in the US, but only to \u201cmake sure foreign terrorists cannot obtain admission\u201d. It was exactly what evangelical Christians in the audience wanted to hear. Some, like Michael David Layne, a 62-year-old US army veteran who regularly attends the King Jesus church, marries what he sees as Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong leadership\u201d with \u201csolid Christian values\u201d, which he said the president showed in Thursday\u2019s military strike. \u201cWe can get anybody, anywhere, anytime, anywhere there is terrorism,\u201d he said. Layne acknowledges that Trump\u2019s life \u2013 which includes three marriages, adultery and alleged affairs with porn stars \u2013 might appear less than pious, but is able to overlook it. \u201cHe might be a little rough around the edges for some people, but he says it like it is, and if some of the things he says or the actions he takes upset some people it doesn\u2019t make him less of a man of God.\u201d Others who came to hear Trump preach were similarly unfazed by the president\u2019s questionable religious credentials. \u201cI believe he has moral character and that he is a man of God,\u201d said Steven Johnson, 65, from New Jersey. \u201cI also believe that he believes people have to pick up the banner and do what\u2019s right. If you don\u2019t pick up the banner then are you really Christian? \u201cIt sickens me the people that say they\u2019re Christian, and they\u2019re praying for people, but they\u2019re stabbing them in the back. It\u2019s a shame. We need a revival in this country and get back to common sense, moral values. We\u2019ve gone way off the deep end.\u201d The need for some kind of national restoration of faith was a topic Trump returned to more than once. \u201cFor America to thrive in the 21st century we must renew faith and family as the center of American life,\u201d the president said during one plainly scripted part of his speech. \u201cFaith-based schools, charities, hospitals, adoption agencies, pastors were systematically targeted by federal bureaucrats and ordered to stop following their beliefs,\u201d he said, without evidence. Friday\u2019s rally, hastily organized in the wake of a stinging Christianity Today editorial last month, recognized Trump\u2019s need to retain the loyalty of the evangelical voting bloc that propelled him to victory in 2016. Four years ago, he won 80% backing from white evangelical voters nationwide. \u201cIn 2016 evangelical Christians went out and helped us in numbers never seen before. We\u2019re going to blow those numbers away in 2020,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI really believe we have God on our side.\u201d For Rose Ann Farrell, 74, from Florida, the claim rang true. \u201cI really believe he was sent to us,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom one to ten, he\u2019s a ten. He lives in a Christian world and we needed a strong Christian, somebody who is not afraid. He speaks for us, has the guts and courage to speak what we want to say. His actions, his intentions, are Christian.\u201d Not everybody agreed. Francisco Morales, 47, traveled 30 miles from Fort Lauderdale with placards highlighting the Ten Commandments he says Trump has violated. \u201cHe\u2019s everything a Christian shouldn\u2019t be. He\u2019s about money and himself, he uses God\u2019s word to his benefit, he doesn\u2019t respect Christian holidays, he insults everyone. And he dishonors his wife, his daughter and all women,\u201d Morales said. \u201cThese people waiting in line for five hours, listening to wonderful Christian music, once they get to that sacred auditorium they hear Trump insult other people \u2026 It\u2019s a holy place but Trump does not respect that.\u201d Florida\u2019s Democratic party, meanwhile, rolled out some religious figures of their own to counter Trump\u2019s appearance. Doug Pagitt, a pastor and executive director of Vote Common Good, an organization that mobilizes voters of faith, decried Trump\u2019s event as a sham. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to use this rally and this base to give cover for his broken promises and his immoral policies,\u201d Pagitt said. \u201cIt is Trump\u2019s desperate response to the realization that he\u2019s losing his primary voting bloc, faith voters. He realizes he needs every last vote if he wants a shot at re-election [and] losing even five per cent ends his chances. \u201cVoters know that their faith does not depend on the power of the presidency.\u201d",

In wet weather, the sodden, damson-coloured seedheads turn spidery and go unnoticed. In dry weather, however, the feathery plumes fluff and curl in on themselves to form globes that catch the light. Then they form an ethereal smoke blossom in silver, gold or bronze, appearing at the same hour for days before vanishing, then reappearing. The plant has a phantom quality. Halfway between the two weathers, particularly in fog, the seedhead centres of the globes each hold a pearl of light in a drop of water. Diffused by fronds like miniature ostrich plumes, they glow like tiny Victorian gas lamps, or dimming fairy lights. Wild clematis has many names: traveller\u2019s joy, old man\u2019s beard, shepherd\u2019s delight, smokewood. My preferred name is bedwine, from the old Berkshire border dialect. Adam Thorpe revived the name in his novel of this place, Ulverton. Bedwine twines through the centuries and chapters of his book. It\u2019s a curious name, until you say \u201cbetwined\u201d in the accent, dropping the \u201ct\u201d, then the \u201cd\u201d. This winter, I used the thick vines hanging from tall trees as a swing. Hanging down like ropes in a school gymnasium and stirring childhood memories, the great, twisted, straw-like cables seemed to suggest I should. I stepped into a creaking loop half a metre off the ground, like a nervous novice trapeze artist, above a shallow chalk pit netted with it. A hank uncoiled. It did not break, but I was tipped upside down, scattering wood pigeons, caught by an ankle and the unyielding, twisted vine that had somehow slipped around my waist. I wriggled free and made a slow, undignified fall into the safety net below, just out of a flailing arm\u2019s reach.",

Sarmin lies to the east of Idlib city and has recently become a sanctuary for displaced people fleeing a campaign of aerial bombing and ground attacks launched by forces loyal to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. More than 235,000 civilians have left their homes in the past few weeks, the UN has said. The missile appeared to have dispersed cluster bombs, survivors said. Abu Omar runs an internet cafe 20 metres from the school gate and was turning his generators on when he heard the first explosion and dropped to the ground instinctively. He lived in besieged areas of Homs city, so is familiar with the sound of different bombs, he said. \u201cAfter the first sound, I started hearing multiple consecutive explosions, therefore I recognised we were targeted with cluster bombs. I got a fragment in my left leg while the cluster bombs were still exploding so I crawled inside my cafe until the explosions stopped,\u201d he said. Naji Al Mustafa, the spokesperson of the National Front for Liberation (NLF) militia said missile fragments recovered from the site suggested it was a Russian-made Tochka surface-to-surface missile with a range of between 70 and 90 kilometres. \u201cThis missile is a container of cluster bombs which opens before it reaches its target, so the bombs fall to cover an area of about 100 square metres,\u201d he said. The Tochka missile has been used to hit residential areas before, he said, including the bombing of a displacement camp and hospital in November in which at least 22 people were killed. Attacks on schools are also a hazard for civilians in the area. Local monitoring groups say 27 in opposition held areas were hit in December, as well as dozens of hospitals and medical facilities over the year. Aid agencies have repeatedly warned that attacking Idlib puts the lives of 3 million civilians in danger and could trigger the worst humanitarian disaster of a war that has lasted nearly a decade. Originally home to about a million people, the province\u2019s population has been swollen with civilians displaced by fighting elsewhere in the country. A ceasefire deal brokered by Russia and Turkey in 2018 was supposed to protect Idlib, but it unravelled after the hardline Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) wrested control of the area from more moderate rebel groups a year ago. Nor was a Russian-announced unilateral ceasefire in August ever fully implemented.",

They evacuated on 30 December to Tathra, only to find themselves evacuating again when a warning of approaching fire came through at 3.30am.</p> <p>Six adults, six children and three dogs \u2013 her family as well as her friends\u2019 families \u2013 then made their way to Bega, where they got stuck.

      "bodyText": "When Erin Riley tweeted an offer of the paddocks behind her house to bushfire evacuees with animals, the PhD student did not expect herself to be running an emergency accommodation service by the end of the week. But that\u2019s precisely what happened after her New Year\u2019s Eve tweet was shared widely. People began responding with similar offers, so Riley started a database of volunteers and began matching them with those seeking help. In four days Riley\u2019s impromptu organisation, FindABed, has received offers of accommodation from more than 3,000 people. They have so far helped some 50 people from fire-affected areas \u2013 many with pets, who would otherwise find it difficult to secure accommodation. \u201cIt can be anything from just somewhere to have a cup of tea and wait, to somewhere to stay more long term,\u201d Riley told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe even had someone who just wanted a shower.\u201d Riley\u2019s is just one of many stories of community members taking initiative and banding together to support one another amid the devastation and ongoing toll of Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis. A musician, Kathy Mikkelsen, told Guardian Australia that she and her family had been in Mallacoota where she was supposed to be performing with her band at the golf club on New Year\u2019s Eve. They evacuated on 30 December to Tathra, only to find themselves evacuating again when a warning of approaching fire came through at 3.30am. Six adults, six children and three dogs \u2013 her family as well as her friends\u2019 families \u2013 then made their way to Bega, where they got stuck. Concerned about protecting their children from embers falling, they started to erect a camp in the underground car park of the local Safeway, when the trolley attendant, a Sudanese refugee named Ibrahim, stopped them and offered his home for the night \u2013 a tiny flat above the shops. \u201cHe found us all beds and his girlfriend cooked us all a big meal,\u201d Mikkelsen wrote on Facebook. \u201cWe sheltered there the night and played music with the only instruments we had, a recorder, a ukulele, some spoons and two flashlights for the light show. The couple told us it was the best New Year\u2019s Eve they had ever had.\u201d She told Guardian Australia: \u201cIt was just such a beautiful gesture.\u201d Stories of resilience are emerging from inside bushfire-affected communities too, such as that of a Malua Bay pharmacist, Raj Gupta, who has kept his pharmacy open despite the area having no power or mobile phone service \u2013 and despite the fact that his own home burnt down in the fires this week. \u201cI\u2019ve had my patients come in and say they\u2019ve not only lost their house and their belongings but also their medication,\u201d he told SBS. The loss of power means he cannot take payment for the medications. \u201cPeople will come back and pay,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are very honourable people.\u201d Many evacuation centres are taking in domestic animals and even livestock, setting aside space for them alongside their owners. Donations have been rolling in to Foodbank Victoria, with footage showing queues of cars lined up to drop off goods at its Yarraville donations point. Refugee and migrant communities have also been organising support. On Thursday the Australian Islamic Centre in Hobsons Bay, Victoria, issued a callout for donations of funds and essential food and supplies through social media and its community networks. It also held a sausage sizzle on Friday that raised $1,500 for bushfire relief. Members of the community distributed the food and essentials on Saturday to fire-affected regions, with the assistance of the MFB and charity Human Appeal Australia. The Muslim community has been organising bushfire relief since the fires started in New South Wales in November. The Afghan community group the Kateb Hazara Association made a $18,252 donation to the Rural Fire Service. In December a group of four men from Sydney\u2019s Muslim community in Auburn took a ute loaded with sausages, water and a barbecue, and drove six hours north to Willawarrin to cook for the community after fire tore through the small town in November. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight fires but we can put a barbecue on,\u201d one of the men, Jawad Nabouche, told the ABC. \u201cIt\u2019s the least we can do, to try help the community and help everybody up here and put a smile on everybody\u2019s faces.\u201d Some communities have been banding together to prepare for potentially dangerous conditions ahead. Karen-Burmese refugees in the town of Nhill, in the Wimmera region of western Victoria, have produced in-language bushfire safety videos with the help of the Country Fire Authority for newcomers to their community. The region regularly faces hot, dry summers, with temperatures in the high 30s expected in the coming week. Celebrities and public figures have also been contributing to the bushfire relief campaign. The comedian Celeste Barber raised an estimated $5.5m in donations in 24 hours for firefighting services after posting an appeal to Instagram, accompanied by images of the eerie yellow light that could be seen from inside her mother-in-law\u2019s house. \u201cThis is out of control! You are all out of control. My love and appreciation for you all is out of control,\u201d she wrote on Facebook on Saturday morning, as the pledged donation total continued to rise. \u201cUnfortunately today the fires are due to get even more out of control. Thank you.\u201d Local and international musicians have put on a host of fundraising gigs, after the annual Falls festival in Lorne was cancelled last week due to bushfire threat. Peking Duk donated $50,000 to the Red Cross and fire services across the country from a hastily arranged show at Melbourne\u2019s Esplanade Hotel on Sunday night. The gig raised $44,500 from sales of tickets, merchandise and direct donations, with the band rounding up the total donated figure themselves. The Melbourne pop singer G Flip raised an estimated $10,000 in donations from her Falls replacement gig on Monday night. The US pop star Halsey and the UK pop-punk artist Yungblud also held fundraising concerts this week, while New Year\u2019s Eve revellers in Sydney donated more than $2m to the Red Cross bushfire relief.",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said the federal government will agree to a request made 18 months ago to permanently increase funding to boost Australia\u2019s aerial firefighting capacity. As Australia\u2019s unprecedented bushfire crisis continues, the availability of large air tankers to supplement smaller aircraft has come under the spotlight. On Saturday afternoon, Morrison announced that up to $20m would be made available to lease four extra planes \u2013 two long-range fixed-wing DC-10s with 30,000 litres capacity and two medium-range large air tankers with an 11,000 litre capacity. Morrison also confirmed that $11m payments to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre \u2013 made to top up the centre in 2018 and 2019 \u2013 would \u201cgo into this year\u2019s budget on an ongoing basis\u201d. In May 2018, the NAFC sent the government a business case requesting a permanent increase of $11m to its annual budget. Guardian Australia has seen a copy of the summary of the business case, which is currently with David Littleproud, the minister responsible for emergency management. The business case shows the annual costs of leasing aircraft and coordinating that NAFC have been rising due to inflation, but the contribution from the federal government has remained the same. On Saturday morning, the NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a positive response to that business case.\u201d The NAFC \u2013 which works coordinates aerial firefighting across all states and territories \u2013 asked the federal government for an extra $11m a year, on top of the existing $14.8m a year budgeted in the five years to 2017-18. The $11m annual request in funding included: $1.1m a year to make up for losses from inflation, and a new clause that future cash would be index-linked $2.2m to make up for losses due to unfavourable foreign exchange rates that affected overseas leasing agreements $7.5m to support leasing of aircraft that would be matched by other states and territories $1.6m over three years to develop a risk management model to improve decisions on where aircraft should be deployed The government had provided two ad hoc payments to the centre of $11m in 2018 and 2019 but had not made the payments permanent. Fitzsimmons said the national sharing arrangements \u201cwork very well\u201d but added: \u201cWhat we need is certainty around the funding going forward so we can secure better economies of scale and certainty around what we\u2019ve got here and how we\u2019re sharing it going into the future.\u201d The chief executive of the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council, Stuart Ellis, told Guardian Australia he did not know why the proposal had been left unresolved for so long. The council is responsible for the NAFC. Ellis said the federal government\u2019s NAFC budget had not been adjusted for inflation and other cost rises since 2004, and part of the proposal was to recoup these losses. He said: \u201cThe reason the business case was put forward as an ongoing contribution by the Commonwealth is that we can then get the best possible deal, because you then have a long-term commitment for the large air tankers over three to five years.\u201d The largest chunk of the extra funding request \u2013 the $7.5m to lease aircraft \u2013 was mostly to cover the \u201cstanding costs\u201d of having the aircraft on the ground and available. He said the daily costs of operating the aircraft were paid for by whichever state was using them at the time. The business case said the proposal would deliver $7.1m in net benefits every year, \u201cthrough procurement staff and service provider cost savings\u201d. \u201cWe want [the funds] in advance because we can then achieve a lot more with it, rather than getting it in the midst of a fire season\u201d, it said.

According to the Post, C\u00e9spedes keeps traps on his ranch to keep boar away, but one boar was removed from a trap and \u201ceither charged toward Cespedes or startled him, causing Cespedes to step into a hole\u201d.

His base pay would rise to $11m as soon as he is on the active roster or on the IL for a non-related injury. A two-time All-Star, the 34-year-old won a Gold Glove in 2015 and a Silver Slugger the following year.
