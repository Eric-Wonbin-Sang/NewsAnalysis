      "body": "<p>A female paedophile who operated as part of a \u201csickening ring\u201d of child abusers is set to be released next month, the Parole Board has confirmed.</p> <p>Angela Allen was part of a ring including three other women, who were convinced by IT consultant Colin Blanchard to share photographs of themselves abusing children.</p> <p>Mother-of-one Allen received an indeterminate sentence in 2009 with a minimum term of five years, after pleading guilty to four child sex assaults and one count of making and distributing an indecent image.</p> <p>After her release, Allen, from Nottingham, will be subject to strict licence conditions including polygraph testing, a curfew, restrictions on her contact with children, and adherence with \u201cexclusion zones\u201d to prevent contact with her victims.</p> <p>The paedophile ring included Vanessa George, who took photographs of herself abusing children at the Plymouth nursery where she worked, alongside Tracy Lyons and Tracy Dawber. All five were jailed for their part in what prosecutors described as \u201cone of the most sickening paedophile rings this country has seen\u201d.</p> <p>The ring was exposed after an investigation spanning five police forces. It was launched when Blanchard\u2019s business partner found images of abuse on his laptop.</p> <p>During the investigation, Det Supt Adrian Pearson of Nottinghamshire police said Allen was a \u201csinister and evil individual\u201d who had \u201cnot shed a tear of remorse\u201d.</p> <p>According to police, Allen was unemployed and living \u201con the fringes of society\u201d in a run-down house without any furniture. She met Blanchard online in 2008.</p> <p>The Parole Board report said that Allen had been in \u201cunsuitable relationships\u201d at the time, and had developed \u201cinappropriate ways of thinking\u201d due to social isolation and low self-esteem. It also said that she drank excessive amounts of alcohol and had used illegal drugs.</p> <p>Allen has previously been held in an open prison and undertaken voluntary community work, and had been allowed temporary releases from prison.

      "bodyText": "A female paedophile who operated as part of a \u201csickening ring\u201d of child abusers is set to be released next month, the Parole Board has confirmed. Angela Allen was part of a ring including three other women, who were convinced by IT consultant Colin Blanchard to share photographs of themselves abusing children. Mother-of-one Allen received an indeterminate sentence in 2009 with a minimum term of five years, after pleading guilty to four child sex assaults and one count of making and distributing an indecent image. After her release, Allen, from Nottingham, will be subject to strict licence conditions including polygraph testing, a curfew, restrictions on her contact with children, and adherence with \u201cexclusion zones\u201d to prevent contact with her victims. The paedophile ring included Vanessa George, who took photographs of herself abusing children at the Plymouth nursery where she worked, alongside Tracy Lyons and Tracy Dawber. All five were jailed for their part in what prosecutors described as \u201cone of the most sickening paedophile rings this country has seen\u201d. The ring was exposed after an investigation spanning five police forces. It was launched when Blanchard\u2019s business partner found images of abuse on his laptop. During the investigation, Det Supt Adrian Pearson of Nottinghamshire police said Allen was a \u201csinister and evil individual\u201d who had \u201cnot shed a tear of remorse\u201d. According to police, Allen was unemployed and living \u201con the fringes of society\u201d in a run-down house without any furniture. She met Blanchard online in 2008. The Parole Board report said that Allen had been in \u201cunsuitable relationships\u201d at the time, and had developed \u201cinappropriate ways of thinking\u201d due to social isolation and low self-esteem. It also said that she drank excessive amounts of alcohol and had used illegal drugs. Allen has previously been held in an open prison and undertaken voluntary community work, and had been allowed temporary releases from prison. The report stated that she had built \u201cconstructive relationships\u201d with officials and had a \u201cgood attitude\u201d to work in custody. The move comes after nursery worker George was released from prison in September last year, despite refusing to reveal the scale of her abuse or the identities of her victims. Among other restrictions, she was banned from entering Devon and Cornwall and from owning a device with access to the internet. A spokesperson for the Parole Board confirmed that they had directed the release of Allen after an oral hearing last month. \u201cParole Board decisions are solely focused on whether a prisoner would represent a significant risk to the public after release,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe panel will have carefully looked at a whole range of evidence, including details of the original evidence and any evidence of behaviour change. \u201cWe do that with great care and public safety is our number one priority,\u201d the spokesperson added.",

They finished 19th that year and, towards the end of the following season, Neil would be sacked. Such is the style and verve Farke has brought that it is difficult to envisage a similar outcome a year from now even if they go down, but football moves in mysterious ways. To emphasise the point, it is not inconceivable Neil\u2019s Preston side, only a point shy of the Championship play-offs even if their festive form was poor, will swap places with his former club in May. He has done an impressive job at Deepdale and it is easy to forget, given that his managerial career began in 2013, he is still only 38.

Tottenham seemed to have turned the corner, with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s first two games resulting in a couple of 3-2 wins. Middlesbrough, on the other hand, had just been hammered 4-0 by Leeds, a result that extended a dismal run of form to one win in 12 in the Championship and left them perilously close to the bottom three. Jonathan Woodgate was on the brink, with Neil Warnock reportedly being lined up as a replacement. A month later, though, Boro come into this tie on the back of four wins on the bounce and are beginning to ponder a play-off push, while Spurs\u2019 Christmas hangover has included a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/28/norwich-tottenham-premier-league-report\">draw at Norwich</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/01/southampton-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">defeat at Southampton</a>. All of a sudden this is not a trip Tottenham will be relishing. <strong>JA</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Middlesbrough v Tottenham Hotspur (Sunday, 2.01pm)</em></p> <h2>5) A distraction Leeds could do without</h2> <p>Although glamorous enough on paper to have been handpicked by TV executives for the Monday night slot on BBC, in reality Leeds United\u2019s visit to Arsenal may end up being something of a damp squib. With his side leading the Championship at this time last year, Marcelo Bielsa sent a youthful side to QPR, where they duly lost. Leeds ultimately failed to secure promotion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/15/leeds-united-derby-county-championship-play-off-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\">coming up short in the play-offs</a> but they remain in the box-seat to go up automatically at their second attempt under Bielsa. The distraction of an FA Cup run is one they could almost certainly do without and their manager is likely to pick his team for the Emirates accordingly. Following his players\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/01/arsenal-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">exertions against Manchester United</a>, Mikel Arteta is also likely to pick a second-string side, although given the insatiable lust of Arsenal fans for the first trophy of the post-Wenger era, one suspects a win for whatever team Arsenal field will suit both managers just fine. <strong>BG</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Arsenal v Leeds United (Monday, 7.56pm)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"331dfdaaf95f53029fdc655a26da21a8a9d612e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/331dfdaaf95f53029fdc655a26da21a8a9d612e3/0_0_4257_2838/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leeds United manager Marcelo Bielsa watches his side take on Luton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leeds United manager Marcelo Bielsa watches his side take on Luton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Davies/ProSports/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6) Assorted Premier League teams not remotely fussed</h2> <p>While in a perfect, happy-clappy world, each and every team would do try their damnedest to win the FA Cup, the benefits of losing in the third round cannot be overstated for Premier League clubs with more pressing concerns. Seven top-flight teams came a cropper at the first time of asking last season and were duly rewarded with an 11-day winter break later in the month while their rivals prepared for and played in the fourth round. After the gruelling Christmas schedule, what manager wouldn\u2019t fancy a period of recalibration in sunnier climes? While helpful, it is worth noting that these impromptu winter breaks are no guarantee of league success \u2013 of those seven top-flight teams, three were relegated. <strong>BG</strong></p> <h2>7) Bournemouth and Luton in need of a lift</h2> <p>Quite a lot of water has passed under the bridge since these two last bumped into each other in the winter of 2008-09. That season featured two draws as Bournemouth (who were deducted 17 points after financial problems) finished 21st in League Two and Luton (deducted 30 for being in a right old mess) ended up dead last, tumbling into the Conference. Since those dark days both clubs have largely been on an upward trajectory (though not in the FA Cup: Bournemouth have been past the third round only twice since, Luton only once), one that has taken the Cherries into the Premier League and the Hatters to the Championship. But their engines are just beginning to stutter \u2013 away defeats five miles apart in London this week are reason for anxiety. Bournemouth\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/01/west-ham-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">4-0 hammering at West Ham</a> leaves them in the bottom three, while Luton\u2019s 3-1 loss at Millwall left them holding up the rest of the Championship. So both teams need to balance the desire to keep players fresh for their respective relegation battles with the need for a morale-boosting victory. <strong>JA</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Bournemouth v Luton Town (5.31pm, Saturday)</em></p> <h2>8) Minamino can make quick Liverpool impact</h2> <p>Sunday will mark exactly two years since Virgil van Dijk set a resounding tone for his impact at Liverpool. Van Dijk scored a last-gasp header to win the third-round derby against Everton at Anfield on his debut and, while the other end of the pitch is where he has helped change J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team beyond recognition, as a way of gaining early favour it could hardly have been better. Takumi Minamino may not end up having as profound an impact on Liverpool\u2019s entire balance but the former Salzburg schemer is likely to make his own bow. What were the odds of this tie being drawn again, and what price another arrival to remember? Minamino should be well rested, given his last action was on 10 December against his new club, but more importantly his performance in that Champions League fixture suggested he has the high-intensity style required to hit the ground running. If he can repeat Van Dijk\u2019s impact, it could signify good times ahead. <strong>NA</strong><br><br><em>\u2022 Liverpool v Everton (4.01pm, Sunday)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3a2eb2a702622a1753023fbe7d989c1ec1b2182\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3a2eb2a702622a1753023fbe7d989c1ec1b2182/0_101_3457_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Takumi Minamino was signed from Red Bull Salzburg in December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Takumi Minamino was signed from Red Bull Salzburg in December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) The Den stages a battle of the giantkillers</h2> <p>These days the FA Cup tends to mean tales of giantkilling derring-do from Mike Flynn and his Newport County side. It has also come to inspire heroics from Millwall, flying under Gary Rowett and currently sitting in the Championship\u2019s top six, have reached the quarter-finals twice in the last three seasons; Newport have beaten Leeds and Leicester since January 2018, also holding Spurs and giving Manchester City a game, so in theory it should not take too much for some blood and thunder to occur. Millwall\u2019s unexpected successcomes at a price though, with Rowett likely to rotate, while Newport have not won in 10 League Two games and will prioritise their climbing into the play-off picture. \u201cThe league is our bread and butter, so I\u2019d prefer to have another league game coming up,\u201d their striker Jamille Matt admitted this week. His colleague Padraig Amond should be feeling hungry for more cup success though: Amond has scored in eight successive rounds, spanning this season and last, and continuing that run would put him three short of Stan Mortensen\u2019s all-time record. <strong>NA</strong><br><br><em>\u2022 Millwall v Newport (12.31pm, Saturday)</em></p> <h2>10) Vale look to ancient history for inspiration</h2> <p>On Thursday, Port Vale were held to a 2-2 draw at home by crisis club Macclesfield Town in League Two. On Saturday they travel to Manchester City to see how the other half live and, to make sure as many dyed-in-the-wool fans of the Potteries club as possible get their chance to attend, Vale came up with a novel tiebreaker when they received an extra batch of tickets. Those seeking a nibble at the increased allocation had to send in a 300-word mini-essay detailing how they have supported Vale over the years, and why they should be included in a ballot. Those who got lucky will dream that John Askey\u2019s team can emulate a result from times past. Vale visited Maine Road on 4 November 1997and their 3-2 win is often cited among the depths City had to plumb in sinking to the third tier. The swing in fortunes seen since will almost certainly never be reversed but Vale, 10th in a division whose wider financial troubles may only just be beginning, will appreciate the payday and if a few of those present 22 years ago got lucky in the ballot then it might rekindle a few fond old memories. <strong>NA</strong><br><br><em>\u2022 Manchester City v Port Vale (5.31pm, Saturday)</em></p>",

Van Dijk scored a last-gasp header to win the third-round derby against Everton at Anfield on his debut and, while the other end of the pitch is where he has helped change J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team beyond recognition, as a way of gaining early favour it could hardly have been better. Takumi Minamino may not end up having as profound an impact on Liverpool\u2019s entire balance but the former Salzburg schemer is likely to make his own bow. What were the odds of this tie being drawn again, and what price another arrival to remember? Minamino should be well rested, given his last action was on 10 December against his new club, but more importantly his performance in that Champions League fixture suggested he has the high-intensity style required to hit the ground running. If he can repeat Van Dijk\u2019s impact, it could signify good times ahead. NA \u2022 Liverpool v Everton (4.01pm, Sunday) 9) The Den stages a battle of the giantkillers These days the FA Cup tends to mean tales of giantkilling derring-do from Mike Flynn and his Newport County side. It has also come to inspire heroics from Millwall, flying under Gary Rowett and currently sitting in the Championship\u2019s top six, have reached the quarter-finals twice in the last three seasons; Newport have beaten Leeds and Leicester since January 2018, also holding Spurs and giving Manchester City a game, so in theory it should not take too much for some blood and thunder to occur. Millwall\u2019s unexpected successcomes at a price though, with Rowett likely to rotate, while Newport have not won in 10 League Two games and will prioritise their climbing into the play-off picture. \u201cThe league is our bread and butter, so I\u2019d prefer to have another league game coming up,\u201d their striker Jamille Matt admitted this week. His colleague Padraig Amond should be feeling hungry for more cup success though: Amond has scored in eight successive rounds, spanning this season and last, and continuing that run would put him three short of Stan Mortensen\u2019s all-time record. NA \u2022 Millwall v Newport (12.31pm, Saturday) 10) Vale look to ancient history for inspiration On Thursday, Port Vale were held to a 2-2 draw at home by crisis club Macclesfield Town in League Two. On Saturday they travel to Manchester City to see how the other half live and, to make sure as many dyed-in-the-wool fans of the Potteries club as possible get their chance to attend, Vale came up with a novel tiebreaker when they received an extra batch of tickets. Those seeking a nibble at the increased allocation had to send in a 300-word mini-essay detailing how they have supported Vale over the years, and why they should be included in a ballot. Those who got lucky will dream that John Askey\u2019s team can emulate a result from times past. Vale visited Maine Road on 4 November 1997and their 3-2 win is often cited among the depths City had to plumb in sinking to the third tier. The swing in fortunes seen since will almost certainly never be reversed but Vale, 10th in a division whose wider financial troubles may only just be beginning, will appreciate the payday and if a few of those present 22 years ago got lucky in the ballot then it might rekindle a few fond old memories.

      "bodyText": "Here is Paul Wilson\u2019s match report from Anfield. When BT\u2019s Des Kelly suggests that Liverpool passed Sheffield United to dath, Klopp replies: \u201cThat was the plan actually. I didn\u2019t see a game against Sheffield United where the opponents controlled the game like we did tonight. That was our plan, to make their life as complicated as possible. The lads were exceptional... That was the important thing: keep this game not spectacular. Sheffield United are not used to that. They are used to winning the balls earlier.\u201d Sheffield United\u2019s manager is miffed at a \u201creally below-par performance\u201d and says Liverpool did all the unglamorous bits of the game better than his team: \u201cIt was very unlike us. We didn\u2019t lay a glove on them. We didn\u2019t do anything that has got us into this position ... We made it difficult for them at our place but not here ... They won every first ball, every second ball, ran forward and ran back. They did it better than us... They played in second or third gear but still had the humility and desire to do that as world champions, European champions and obviously well on the way to being Premier League champions.... I wish J\u00fcrgen and Liverpool all the best. I love everything about them, the physical and tactical aspects. \u201d Jordan Henderson: \u201cThe performance level has been really high for a long period of time but we just have to continue that. Keep doing what were doing. Keep working hard an concentrate on the next challenge, which is the next game.\u201d Van Dijk: \u201cWe\u2019re doing alright. We just focus on the next game ahead of us. Sheffield are a very good side. We prepared for this very well and you could see that on the pitch. We were calm and composed.\u201d Henderson: \u201cWe can still improve. In the last few minutes they chad a good chance and we can\u2019t afford that.\u201d And yes, now they are being asked about the possibility of going the whole season unbeaten? \u201cI\u2019m not really bothered about that,\u201d sayd Henderson. \u201cI\u2019m just bothered about the next game. Not looking too far ahead. Let\u2019s see where it takes us.\u201d Liverpool stroll 13 points clear at the top of the table, with a game in hand. They totally bossed this game against fine opponents, so much so that it felt like a dead rubber from the moment Salah gave them the lead in the fourth minute. Mane later made it 2-0 and United did well to keep the score down, though not well enough to even hint at stalling Liverpool\u2019s title charge. It\u2019s not looking like anyone can stop them. 90+2 min: Liverpool substitution: Elliot on, Salah off. Now let\u2019s see him get a touch... 90+1 min: It\u2019s stoppage time and his team are royally comfortable ... but there\u2019s Divock Origi, making a decisive tackle in his own box. That\u2019s one of the reasons Liverpool fans love him. 90 min: Here\u2019s a stat that encapsulates Liverpool\u2019s dominance: no team in the Premier League era, according to BT, has completed as many passes in a match as they have today. 89 min: Liverpool substitution: Lallana off, Robertson off. 88 min: Nearly! O\u2019Connell blasted a cross into the six-yard box. McBurnie lunged at it and turns it towards goal from three yards ... but he hit it into the ground and it bounced u into the arms of Alisson! 88 min: United showing their gumption by finishing on the attack. Can they plunder a consolation goal? 86 min: Why has Klopp not made all his subs yet? Give Salah a rest and give us another look at Harvey Elliot. 85 min: A wild pass by Alexander-Arnold gives United a throw-in near the Liverpool corner flag on the left. Three seconds later, however, Liverpool are streaking forward on another counter-attack. but Egan makes a crucial tackle to stop them, this time. 83 min: The visitors win a corner! Lundstram\u2019s delivery is good, forcing Van Dijk to head it out for another one on the far side. As the next one comes in, O\u2019Connell is punished for a gentle shove in the back of Van Dijk. 81 min: After Egan heads away a cross by Alexander-Arnold, Robertson cracks a vicious shot towards goal from over 20 yards. Blocked. 80 min: Gomes scorches down the right wing - why not? - and wins a corner. 77 min: Sheffield United substitution: Besic on; Norwood off. 77 min: Liverpool substitution: Man\u00e9 off for a well-earned rest and to a huge ovation; Origi on. 77 min: This match feels increasingly like a dead rubber ... 74 min: Wonderful, cutting one-two between Robertson and Man\u00e9. Man\u00e9 tries to top it off with a goal from an acute angle, but Henderson foils him. He should have squared it to Firmino, who was free in front of goal. 72 min: I forgot to mention in the aftermath of the last goal that United made a couple of subs. They\u2019ve replaced their strike force, for all the good that\u2019ll do them. McBurnie and Sharp are on for McGoldrick and Mousset. \u201cYes, if Liverpool set all sorts of records, then we can stop football,\u201d trumpets Matt Dony. \u201cAlternatively, should it all go pear-shaped from here (which I\u2019m still expecting!), then football will be over for me, personally. Not sure I could face next season. I used to see United fans being super-confident once they had a lead in the league. How did they do it? How did they silence the gnawing doubt? How were they not gibbering, fearful wrecks?\u201d Liverpool fans were once like that, too, and then, well, things changed ... 70 min: It\u2019s not that Sheffield United have played badly. It\u2019s that they have been rendered so utterly helpless that this has never looked like a real contest. No one else has done this to the Blades this season. Liverpool are exceptional. 67 min: Alexander-Arnold flashes the ball across the face of goal. Firmino fails to make a clean connection, and it\u2019s stabbed out for a corner. An excellent goal on the counter! it started with Alison, who rolled the ball out to Robertson, who zipped it on to Man\u00e9. The Senegalese played it to Salah in the D, then sprinted behind to accept the return pass. Dean Henderson saved his first effort but Man\u00e9 leapt back up to ram the ball into the empty net from close range. 61 min: Penalty? Nope. Baldock\u2019s challenge on Mane was good after a one-two between the Senegalese and Firmino. Liverpool have to settle for a corner. They take it short and resume passing it around. It comes to Salah about five yards outside the box on the right hand side. He chips in a little curler, looking for Van Dijk\u2019s head. The Dutchman can\u2019t reach it ... and the ball carries on and hits the inside of the post, before rolling across the line and into the hands of a relieed Dean Henderson! 60 min: The visitors make it into Liverpool\u2019s half and actually work an opportunity to threaten Liverpool\u2019s box. And then Fleck fires his cross into Stevens\u2019 face, decking his teammate. 58 min: Henderson twirls away from two players in midfield and switches play to the other side. When it comes to Firmino on the left, the Brazilian cuts on to his right foot and lets fly with a curler from the corner of the box. It misses the far corner by inches. 55 min: Sheffield United continue to fend off Liverpool. But that\u2019s all they\u2019re doing. They can\u2019t get out of their own half at the moment, which is very unlike them. Liverpool are lording it. 52 min:Alexander-Arnold chops on to his left foot and has a bang from 20 yards. Lundstram blocks. 49 min: O\u2019Connell gets in front of Salah to cut out an incoming pass by Alexander-Arnold. Sheffiled United continue to defend well but have shown no sign yet in this second half that they can knock Liverpool out of their comfortable stride. 47 min: A handball by Basham gives Liverpool a freekick in a useful crossing position wide on the left. Robertson bends it right into the six-yard box. But Mane and Van Dijk can\u2019t apply a killer touch. In Mane\u2019s case that was mainly because Egan had his arms all over him. but the ref saw nothing awry and nor, presumably, did VAR. 46 min: Play resumes with a Liverpool kickoff as per the rules. \u201cIf Liverpool get record points, win the FA Cup and Champions League and do an invincible season, does that mean they\u2019ve completed the game and everyone stops playing?\u201d Yes. And then we\u2019ll all have to start watching baseball instead. Oh god, can\u2019t Wolves or someone at least win the FA Cup? \u201cI am a Klopp sceptic,\u201d announces Paul Griffin. \u201cI think it\u2019s all luck and this is the year it falls apart. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s not even German. I met a man very like him in Padstow once. He was just a foot shorter, and darker, but otherwise identical, with no trace of a German accent, and didn\u2019t even mention football. I\u2019ll share my theory about the moon landings later if you like. It was all done with mirrors. And geese.\u201d Liverpool look to be on course for another win thanks to Salah\u2019s early goal. Sheffield United have been decent but have seldom looked like they can pierce the home side\u2019s almost regal poise. They need to find something special in the second half, otherwise Liverpool are just going to cruise on to victory. 44 min: Two fine tackles by Norwood and a defender, first on Mane then on Firmino, stop Liverpool from getting off a shot from the edge of the area. Then when a cross comes in, Basham leaps at it like a stage diver jumping into a crowd of thrash metallers, and heads it clear. 42 min: McGoldrick is everywhere: winning fouls on half-way, making tackles near the dugout, playing cute passes around the centre circle. Any game now he\u2019s scoring to add a goal to his otherwise wonderful repertoire. 40 min: Gomez penalised for a foul on McGoldrick near half-way. \u201cI see that Wayne Rooney\u2019s debut as player coach has started with a assist on the opening goal of the match!\u201d gasps Mary Waltz, who must be too polite to add \u201cagainst Barnsley\u201d. 37 min: The pace has dropped. Liverpool are in control. 35 min: The Blades are neither disheartened nor rash. They continue to play their usual game, confident that they will work more openings. And they might. But so will Liverpool. 32 min: Henderson zips a low pass to Salah, who wraps his foot around the ball and tries to sends it into the net ... but Man\u00e9 can\u2019t get out of the way fast enough and winds up blocking his mate\u2019s shot. Or was that subconscious revenge for all the times Salah has declined to pass to him and instead shot from a ridiculous angle? 30 min: Henderson\u2019s half-volley from 20 yards clips of the heel of Egan and goes out for a corner. 29 min: A ball from the deep, a flick on by Mane and suddenly Liverpool are in again! But Henderson makes another fine save to deny Salah. 27 min: A lull. \u201cI\u2019m fine with Liverpool winning the league - in fact, given the alternatives, I\u2019d actually prefer it, sniffs Clive Jerram. \u201cI just need them to lose one game on their way to doing it. As an Arsenal fan it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got left. But it\u2019s not going to happen today, is it?\u201d Let\u2019s not write off Sheffield United just yet. But we can discount Arsenal\u2019s chances of being the ones to inflict that defeat, right? 25 min: Liverpool set up camp outside the visitors\u2019 box. They are probe patiently. United defend diligently, and Egan eventually steps in to nick the ball off Man\u00e9. 23 min: Nice move by Sheffield United. But Mousset\u2019s low cross from the right is too close to the keeper. McGoldrick is aghast. 21 min: Henderson charges forward as Liverpool counter-attack, with four teammates racing alongside side him, all scenting visitor blood. Henderson chooses Man\u00e9 ... whose control is uncharacteristically shoddy, and a momentary loss of momentum is enough for United to scramble back and cover. 19 min: Man\u00e9 scuttles down the left and feeds Wijnaldum, who lashes over the bar for 16 yards. 17 min: Sheffield United never panic and are still vry much in this. but there\u2019s a purr about Liverpool that suggests they could rack up a nice score today. Which, in a way, is a compliment to United. \u201cI still remember learning the word \u2018aghast\u2019 back in 1975 when Tony Currie put Alan Woodward through on goal with a remarkable 50 yard pass and Gerald Sinstadt said \u2018Liverpool aghast, caught by Woodward\u2019 when Woody scored,\u201d reminisces Phil Grey. \u201cSheffield United won 1-0. All these years later I\u2019m still learning the occasional new word on the Guardian\u2019s MBMs. Keep up the good work.\u201d Yikes, I didn\u2019t think you could hear all our swearing. 15 min: Baldock plays a raking pass through to Lundstram, who looks way offside. He slots the ball into the net just in case VAR spots a defender\u2019s toe nail keeping him onside, but he\u2019s out of luck. 13 min: Superb play by Man\u00e9, who uses power and guile to wriggle past Basham and another defender and scamper towards the area. but the visitors defend well and usher him back out. 11 min: Jordan Henderson pings a low pass in to Salah, who catches it with a beautiful first time shot from 12 yards. And Dean Henderson reacts to make a fabulous one-handed save! 10 min: Stevens dispossesses Salah in midfield but Wijnaldum soon wins it back for Liverpool, who now take a moment to steady themselves anew with some passing around the back. 8 min: McGoldrick unloads a fierce shot from 20 yards, forcing Alisson to palm it over the bar. 7 min: Egan booms a diagonal pass from deep to his fellow Irishman Stevens, who had raided forward from left-back. But the defender\u2019s control lets him down and the ball trickles out of play. 6 min: United have to ride out a storm here. Liverpool are looking for another goal already ... Van Dijk sends a customary diagonal pass over the top for Robertson. Baldock slips but might not have caught the left-back anyway. Robertson fires a low delivery across the six-yard box and Salah beats the defender to it and turns it first-time into the net. Simple yet deadly. 3 min: Alexander-Arnold rolls the ball infield from the right wing to Salah, who tickles it through to Milner in the box. Milner tries to bang a low cross in the six-yard box but Basham reads is well positioned to clear. 3 min: Liverpool stroke the ball around calmly, but United are well organised and prevent them from making any ground. \u201cYes, it will probably take a return of the bubonic plague to stop Liverpool winning their first league title in a generation now,\u201d predicts Justin Kavanagh. \u201cBut the question that my inner headline writer is asking is Can the Blades Clip Klopp in Front of the Kop?\u201d Sharp! 1 min: Liverpool v Sheffield United is go! Keita injured his groin in the warm up and has been replaced by James Milner. The players enter the arena. Liverpool are wearing all red, naturally, while the visitors in all white. The last team to beat Liverpool at Anfield in the Premier League were Crystal Palace ... 33 months ago. In case you don\u2019t want to bother with the lovely preamble and sparkling correspondence from fellow readers, here are the teams again: Liverpool: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson; Milner*, Henderson, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Man\u00e9 Subs: Adrian, Milner, Lallana, Jones, Origi, Philipps, Elliott Sheffield United: Henderson; Basham, Egan, O\u2019Connell; Baldock, Fleck, Norwood, Lundstram, Stevens; Mousset, McGoldrick Subs: Jagielka, McBurnie, Sharp, Verrips, Besic, Osborn, Robinson Referee: P Tierney because Keita got injured in warm up. BT are showing a nice interview at the moment with Sheffield United\u2019s Lundstram and O\u2019Connell, who are best friends and such big Liverpool supporters that they travelled to Madrid together last season to cheer on the team in the Champions League final. \u201cWhat truly delights me about the Blades\u2019 remarkable season is that it makes computers look like fools,\u201d hurrahs Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cRemember that pre-season BBC special where some quaking can of data \u2013 no, not Danny Murphy, the one behind him \u2013 ran a Monte Carlo program of 10,000 simulated seasons and hacked out a fur ball saying Sheffield would finish dead last, threatening Derby County\u2019s unfortunate modern standard of ineptitude? Well so much for that. Vive les carbon units!\u201d Chris Wilder explains, with a chuckle, why he had to bring John Lundstram back into the side today: \u201cHe\u2019d have absolutely killed me if I\u2019d left him out of this, being a Liverpool punter and a scouser.\u201d And just to show, for Andrew Sparrow\u2019s benefit, that anyone can make a mistake ... \u201cDid I hear you referring to Sheffield United\u2019s goalkeeper as Wayne Henderson?\u201d blurts L Keet. \u201cGetting Dean Henderson mixed up with a goalkeeper who last played for Grimsby and retired in 2009 is an impressive one. You must be a keen lower league follower.\u201d Or drunk (I\u2019m a keen lower league follower). \u201cTwo years ago today we were playing Bury at Gigg Lane,\u201d booms Andrew Sparrow. \u201cChris Basham and Jack O\u2019Connell both played in that game as well. Whatever tonight\u2019s result, the mighty Blades have come a long, long way in two years.\u201d I\u2019ve got news for you, Andrew: we\u2019re in 2020 now. So that was three years ago. But your point is righteous one. Klopp and Wilder have fielded their strongest available lineups. Keita is back for Liverpool, while Sheffield United are buoyed by the returns of Lundstram and McGoldrick. We have the Premier League\u2019s two meanest defences in action here, but both rearguards (especially the full-backs/wingbacks) contribute plenty to their teams\u2019 attacks - and both have strikers (Firmino/McGoldrick) who are not prolific but are definitely brilliant. Does that mean there\u2019ll be goals? Or not? This promises to be fassinating and/or fun. Liverpool: Alisson; Alexander-ARnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson; Ke\u00efta, Henderson, Wijnaldum; Man\u00e9, Firmino, Salah Subs: Adrian, Milner, Lallana, Origi, Philipps, Elliott Sheffield United: Henderson; Basham, Egan, O\u2019Connell; Baldock, Fleck, Norwood, Lundstram, Stevens; Mousset, McGoldrick Subs: Jagielka, McBurnie, Sharp, Verrips, Besic, Osborn, Robinson Referee: P Tierney Hello. J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Chris Wilder were nigh-on flawless in 2019 and now aim to pull off the luminous feat of making 2020 even better.

      "body": "<p>The Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran has announced she is in a \u201creally happy, loving, stable relationship\u201d with a woman, saying she decided to go public after being approached by journalists.</p> <p>The MP for Oxford West and Abingdon said she found attributing labels to people\u2019s sexuality contrived, but that the term she most identified with was pansexual, meaning she is attracted to people regardless of their sex or gender identity.</p> <p>Moran, who is thought to be considering a bid for the Lib Dem leadership, said she and her friends had been approached by newspapers that wanted to run stories about her relationship. \u201cThat itself is why I\u2019m coming out now because it is a new year and we need to approach the decade fighting these equalities issues on the front foot,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIf I am going to be outed I want it to be on my own terms,\u201d said Moran. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of it. I\u2019m in a really happy, loving, stable relationship.

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran has announced she is in a \u201creally happy, loving, stable relationship\u201d with a woman, saying she decided to go public after being approached by journalists. The MP for Oxford West and Abingdon said she found attributing labels to people\u2019s sexuality contrived, but that the term she most identified with was pansexual, meaning she is attracted to people regardless of their sex or gender identity. Moran, who is thought to be considering a bid for the Lib Dem leadership, said she and her friends had been approached by newspapers that wanted to run stories about her relationship. \u201cThat itself is why I\u2019m coming out now because it is a new year and we need to approach the decade fighting these equalities issues on the front foot,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I am going to be outed I want it to be on my own terms,\u201d said Moran. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of it. I\u2019m in a really happy, loving, stable relationship. She\u2019s amazing and I\u2019m really lucky.\u201d The MP said that in some ways acceptance of the LGBT community had gone backwards in recent years. \u201cIt\u2019s 2020 now.

Moran met her girlfriend, Rosy Cobb, the Lib Dems\u2019 former head of press, through work. Cobb was suspended by the party during the general election after being accused of forging an email. Moran said the she and her girlfriend had spoken to the Liberal Democrats\u2019 welfare officer about any possible conflicts of interest when they started their relationship, but were told there was no problem.

My words echo</p> <p>Thus, in your mind.\u201d</p> <p>The Eliot scholar Tony Cuda, of the University of North Carolina, who is also the director of the TS Eliot international summer school in London, told the Guardian the release of the letters tells the hidden love story of Eliot\u2019s life \u2013 and of literary modernism.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the missing piece of his career and certainly the most significant revelation about a major poet of the 20th century that we\u2019ve had,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In the newly released letters, written after Eliot and Hale met up at a tea party in London in late 1930, the unhappily married poet wrote on 3 October of that year:</p> <p>\u201cIf you knew what pages and pages of tenderness I am not writing now [underscored] I think you would trust me.</p> <p>\u201cI have no really intimate friends, though vast acquaintances,\u201d Eliot wrote, in his own hand, imploring Hale to accept his ardour.</p> <p>\u201cFor the first and last time, praying that I have given no offense. For I see nothing in this confusion to be ashamed of \u2013 my love is as pure ... as any love can be.\u201d</p> <p>He concluded: \u201cIf this is a love letter it is the last I shall ever write in my life. And I will sign it.\u201d</p> <p>Hale, whose replies no longer exist, accepted Eliot\u2019s entreaties. So began a passionate correspondence with his paramour, who by now was based in Boston, while he was in England.</p> <p>By November of that year, Eliot \u2013 now typing \u2013 wrote he had been in a \u201cstate of torment\u201d for a month.</p> <p>\u201cYou have made me perfectly happy: that is, happier than I have ever been in my life; the only kind of happiness now possible for the rest of my life is now with me; and though it is the kind of happiness which is identical with my deepest loss and sorrow, it is a kind of supernatural ecstasy.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cI tried to pretend that my love for you was dead, though I could only do so by pretending myself that my heart was dead; at any rate, I resigned myself to celibate old age.\u201d</p> <p>Describing himself to be in a \u201ckind of emotional fever\u201d, by December he confessed that \u201cthe pain is more acute, but it is a pain which in the circumstances I would not be without\u201d.</p> <p>The letters were made public for visitors to the spectacular Firestone library at Princeton University in New Jersey on Thursday, having been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/01/ts-eliot-intimate-letters-to-confidante-emily-hale-unveiled-after-60-years\">broken out</a> of wooden crates the day before.</p> <p>For Hale, their circumstances were more complex. Toward the end of her life, in 1969, she offered a three-page account of the relationship to the librarian at Princeton.</p> <p>Eliot had told her to her \u201cgreat surprise\u201d in 1922 \u201chow very much he cared for me; at the time I could return no such feeling\u201d.</p> <p>Hale acknowledged she knew his marriage to be \u201ca very unhappy affair\u201d. But she resisted the entreaties of \u201cthis gifted, emotional, groping personality\u201d, writing that she was \u201cdismayed when he confessed after seeing me again that his affection for me was stronger than ever\u201d.</p> <p>The friendship continued to 1935. \u201cWe saw each other and knew about each other\u2019s lives \u2013 though I had no feeling except of difficult and loyal friendship.\u201d</p> <p>However, Eliot\u2019s commitment to his \u201cmentally ill wife\u201d restricted any further development until his spouse was institutionalized.</p> <p>Then, from 1935 to 1939, Elliot and Hale began spending summers together in Campden, Gloucestershire. She continued in her account: \u201cHe and I became so close to each other under conditions so abnormal, for I found by now I had in turn grown very fond of him.</p> <p>\u201cWe were congenial in so many of our interests, our reactions, and emotional response to each others\u2019 needs \u2013 the happiness, the quiet deep bonds between us and our lives, very rich ... And the more because we kept the relationship on an honourable, to be respected, plane.\u201d</p> <p>Hale wrote that \u201conly a few \u2013 a very few \u2013 of his friends and family, and my circles of friends, knew of our care for each other; and marriage, if and when his wife died \u2013 couldn\u2019t help but become a desired right of fulfillment\u201d.</p> <p>However, their relationship was doomed.

      "bodyText": "TS Eliot\u2019s love letters to scholar Emily Hale, the great poet\u2019s muse and source of \u201csupernatural ecstasy\u201d for more than 30 years, were released on Thursday amid fevered speculation and under tight security at an elegant library on the campus of the Ivy League\u2019s Princeton University. The Nobel laureate\u2019s correspondence to Hale, whom he met when both were studying at Harvard University in 1912, has long been the fascination of Eliot scholars but remained hidden, on both the poet and Hale\u2019s wishes, for 50 years after Hale\u2019s death in 1969. The letters reveal that his feelings for her were intense and later were reciprocated by the younger Hale \u2013 but despite this, their love was ultimately and heartbreakingly thwarted. Hale has long been understood to be the inspiration for some of Eliot\u2019s most breathtaking verse, including the first lines from Burnt Norton, the first poem of his Four Quartets. \u201cWhat might have been is an abstraction Remaining a perpetual possibility Only in a world of speculation. What might have been and what has been Point to one end, which is always present. Footfalls echo in the memory Down the passage which we did not take Towards the door we never opened Into the rose-garden. My words echo Thus, in your mind.\u201d The Eliot scholar Tony Cuda, of the University of North Carolina, who is also the director of the TS Eliot international summer school in London, told the Guardian the release of the letters tells the hidden love story of Eliot\u2019s life \u2013 and of literary modernism. \u201cIt is the missing piece of his career and certainly the most significant revelation about a major poet of the 20th century that we\u2019ve had,\u201d he said. In the newly released letters, written after Eliot and Hale met up at a tea party in London in late 1930, the unhappily married poet wrote on 3 October of that year: \u201cIf you knew what pages and pages of tenderness I am not writing now [underscored] I think you would trust me. \u201cI have no really intimate friends, though vast acquaintances,\u201d Eliot wrote, in his own hand, imploring Hale to accept his ardour. \u201cFor the first and last time, praying that I have given no offense. For I see nothing in this confusion to be ashamed of \u2013 my love is as pure ... as any love can be.\u201d He concluded: \u201cIf this is a love letter it is the last I shall ever write in my life. And I will sign it.\u201d Hale, whose replies no longer exist, accepted Eliot\u2019s entreaties. So began a passionate correspondence with his paramour, who by now was based in Boston, while he was in England. By November of that year, Eliot \u2013 now typing \u2013 wrote he had been in a \u201cstate of torment\u201d for a month. \u201cYou have made me perfectly happy: that is, happier than I have ever been in my life; the only kind of happiness now possible for the rest of my life is now with me; and though it is the kind of happiness which is identical with my deepest loss and sorrow, it is a kind of supernatural ecstasy.\u201d He continued: \u201cI tried to pretend that my love for you was dead, though I could only do so by pretending myself that my heart was dead; at any rate, I resigned myself to celibate old age.\u201d Describing himself to be in a \u201ckind of emotional fever\u201d, by December he confessed that \u201cthe pain is more acute, but it is a pain which in the circumstances I would not be without\u201d. The letters were made public for visitors to the spectacular Firestone library at Princeton University in New Jersey on Thursday, having been broken out of wooden crates the day before. For Hale, their circumstances were more complex. Toward the end of her life, in 1969, she offered a three-page account of the relationship to the librarian at Princeton. Eliot had told her to her \u201cgreat surprise\u201d in 1922 \u201chow very much he cared for me; at the time I could return no such feeling\u201d. Hale acknowledged she knew his marriage to be \u201ca very unhappy affair\u201d. But she resisted the entreaties of \u201cthis gifted, emotional, groping personality\u201d, writing that she was \u201cdismayed when he confessed after seeing me again that his affection for me was stronger than ever\u201d. The friendship continued to 1935. \u201cWe saw each other and knew about each other\u2019s lives \u2013 though I had no feeling except of difficult and loyal friendship.\u201d However, Eliot\u2019s commitment to his \u201cmentally ill wife\u201d restricted any further development until his spouse was institutionalized. Then, from 1935 to 1939, Elliot and Hale began spending summers together in Campden, Gloucestershire. She continued in her account: \u201cHe and I became so close to each other under conditions so abnormal, for I found by now I had in turn grown very fond of him. \u201cWe were congenial in so many of our interests, our reactions, and emotional response to each others\u2019 needs \u2013 the happiness, the quiet deep bonds between us and our lives, very rich ... And the more because we kept the relationship on an honourable, to be respected, plane.\u201d Hale wrote that \u201conly a few \u2013 a very few \u2013 of his friends and family, and my circles of friends, knew of our care for each other; and marriage, if and when his wife died \u2013 couldn\u2019t help but become a desired right of fulfillment\u201d. However, their relationship was doomed. Eliot\u2019s first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot, died in 1947, but instead of devoting himself to Hale, Eliot went on to marry someone else, his second wife, Valerie, for reasons that remain unclear despite the unveiling of the letters. In a letter dated 1960, which Eliot wrote as a statement to Princeton in anticipation of his letters to Hale eventually being made public, he briefly explained the end of his decision not to request her hand in marriage. \u201cEmily Hale would have killed the poet in me; Vivienne nearly was the death of me, but she kept the poet alive.\u201d He continued: \u201cI wish the statement by myself to be made public as soon as the letters to Miss Hale are made public \u2026 I fell in love with Emily Hale in 1912, when I was in the Harvard Graduate School. Before I left for Germany and England in 1914 I told her that I was in love with her.\u201d For herself, Hale wrote that instead of that \u201canticipated life together which could now rightfully be ours \u2013 something too personal ... emotional for me to understand decided TSE against marrying me\u201d. This, Hale continued, \u201cwas both a shock and a sorrow\u201d. \u201cPerhaps I could not have been the companion in marriage he hoped ... Perhaps the vision saved both of us from great unhappiness \u2013 I cannot ever know.\u201d Hale concluded: \u201cThe question of his changed attitude was discussed but nothing was gained from further conversation.\u201d * This article was amended on 2 January 2020 to remove an inaccurate reference to Eliot\u2019s \u2018commitment to Catholicism\u2019.",

      "bodyText": "Frustrated commuters gathered outside Bolton train station on Thursday evening as part of a national day of action to protest against increased rail fares. The demonstration was organised by campaign group Northern Resist in partnership with the Association of British Commuters and Bring Back British Rail. The groups are calling for a nationwide fare freeze until services improve and are using the protests to unite passengers around the country frustrated by months of delays and cancellations. Other actions took place outside stations in cities including London, Norwich and Burton-on-Trent. \u201cDelays are consistent, but short-forms are the real sin. This is when they don\u2019t lay on enough carriages and it\u2019s standing room only. The trains are absolutely rammed \u2013 it\u2019s like match-day trains every day,\u201d said Steve Sutton, part of the Northern Resist group. The campaigners are demanding that Northern, or any new operator that takes over if it loses the franchise, \u201ccancel today\u2019s fare increase to reflect the dire service\u201d. Sutton said trains are often so busy that people faint: \u201cNo one should be forced to lose consciousness on their way to work.\u201d Another protester, Karen Hon, a teacher and local Labour party campaign coordinator, said: \u201cIn a lot of the townships, not just Bolton, the industries have gone. People rely on being able to commute to the cities for work.\u201d She said by using trains, people risk turning up late for work and being sacked, but with buses and cars often delayed on traffic-clogged roads, there are no alternatives. \u201cWith our efforts against climate change, we should be encouraging people to use public transport. People aren\u2019t asking for the world \u2013 they\u2019re just asking to be able to get to work on time.\u201d Sammy Ahmed said her journey home to nearby Chorley, which should take 45 minutes, often takes hours. \u201cI just think the way we\u2019re being treated is absolutely awful. We pay over \u00a32,000 a year for our route from Chorley to Manchester, and they take our money up front and then they cancel all our trains.\u201d She is now refusing to buy a season ticket as she doesn\u2019t want to pay up front for a poor service and is instead choosing to work from home more often. Sutton stressed how much of an impact the service is having on people\u2019s lives. \u201cThere can be weeks on end when a parent doesn\u2019t get that bedtime with the kids, weeks where businesses are missing key staff.\u201d Northern Resist founder Kate Anstee said: \u201cThey implement [the fare increase] in the first week of January, which is when the country is at its poorest \u2013 I can\u2019t stress that enough. \u201cWe\u2019ve endured nine years of austerity and it\u2019s the week after Christmas. These fare rises are not justified, and if they are justified, they need to come at a different point in the year.\u201d She welcomed comments by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, that he has started a process that could strip Northern rail of its franchise or see it issued with a short-term contract. However, Anstee also said chronic underinvestment needs to be tackled for customers to see real change. Between 11 October and 8 November last year, less than half of Northern rail trains ran on time and 5.3% of services were cancelled. The operator runs trains across the north of England, including in Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and Newcastle Upon Tyne. According to the Northern Fail app, there have been 69,726 full and partial cancellations \u2013 34% due to staff shortages and 22% due to train faults - and 47,325 services with reduced carriages on the Northern network since May 2018. Councillor Judith Blake, leader of Leeds city council and West Yorkshire Combined Authority transport lead, said: \u201cHigher fares are never a good way to start the year, but rail passengers will find those taking effect this month particularly galling given the ongoing delays and cancellations which are severely disrupting journeys across the North of England.\u201d She urged the government to introduce greater local control of rail networks, and to make publication of the Williams review into passenger rail services an urgent priority. A spokesperson for Northern said: \u201cNorthern\u2019s average annual fare increase is 2.48%, which means an average weekly season ticket will rise by \u00a31.07 and the average off-peak return by just 25p. These rises, which are below RPI and below the average national increase, will help fund current and future investment in rail services across the north of England.\u201d They added that Northern was working to provide customers with new and better trains and stations.",

In the US, the Dow Jones industrial average reached a record high, extending gains made over the past month. The People\u2019s Bank of China announced it would cut the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve and indicated it would continue to take action in 2020 to reduce borrowing costs for companies, in an intervention that analysts said could help prevent a growth slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Joshua Mahony, a senior market analyst at the financial trading company IG, said: \u201cWith the Chinese pumping $115bn into the banking system, it is likely that the wider economy benefits through an increase in lending for small- and medium-sized companies.\u201d Despite the optimism at the start of the year, business surveys have shown factory output in the UK and the eurozone slumped in December, reflecting Brexit concerns in Britain and the impact of the US-China trade war, which held back global trade and sapped business investment in 2019. Economists said progress between the US and China could be unpicked in the future, warning past examples of compromise had been followed by the trade dispute reigniting. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at the financial trading company Oanda, said: \u201cEverything is not suddenly OK because the US and China are about to sign a phase one trade deal, or because the UK and EU are preparing to discuss the future relationship rather than the divorce. It could be another turbulent year with many surprises along the way.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Macquarie Radio\u2019s Ray Hadley is not as prolific a letter-writer as his stablemate Alan Jones. But he is known for his chummy relations with some politicians, notably the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Morrison had a regular Monday spot on Hadley\u2019s show until April 2017, when the two fell out. But they patched it up in 2018 soon after Morrison got the top job. Guardian Australia requested correspondence between Hadley and federal and NSW ministers under freedom of information laws. The prime minister finally replied to the Guardian\u2019s request on Christmas Eve and produced one letter written in July, in which he pushed back on criticism about the raids on journalists by the Australian Federal Police. Whether this letter was sent to Hadley or Jones is unclear \u2013 the recipient was redacted \u2013 but it was more likely to be Jones, as he has been a critic on-air of the AFP actions. Indeed, Jones was so incensed he emailed Morrison about it while he was overseas in June . Within half an hour a reply arrived direct from Morrison. These emails were not produced as a result of the Guardian\u2019s freedom of information request, but Jones read most of it on air at the time. It is likely there was more correspondence with both broadcasters, but the prime minister\u2019s office invoked s4 of the Freedom of Information Act, which says only correspondence relating to the minister\u2019s duties must be released. Another of 2GB\u2019s regulars, the New South Wales Nationals leader, John Barilaro, did produce documents in response to the information request, which give an insight into how politics is played in NSW, and the way high-profile broadcasters are roped into campaigns. On 6 August, Barilaro\u2019s media adviser received an email from Hadley headed: \u201cAdam Marshall doing the bidding of the Animal Justice Party.\u201d \u201cMate, ask barra what sort of lunacy this is,\u201d Hadley wrote. Copy and pasted into the email were three paragraphs from the Shooters and Fishers complaining about the agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, (also a National), who had asked the chair of a committee \u2013 a Shooters party MP \u2013 for a parliamentary inquiry into the exhibition of circus animals and dolphins and whales in NSW. This was an unusual request from a National and had a whiff of a deal with the Animal Justice party. Because the NSW government does not have a majority in the upper house, it must win over one of the minor parties to get legislation passed. It must deal either with the Shooters or Animal Justice. Shrewdly it cultivates both. But it\u2019s not always easy. Emma Hurst of Animal Justice explained that the party had been seeking an investment from the government in a sea enclosure at Coffs Harbour dolphin marine park, the only place that exhibits dolphins in NSW. \u201cWe want the government to invest in sea pen facilities for retired animals and they said they would first need an inquiry,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cThe wellbeing of circus animals was tacked on.\u201d The Shooters were horrified by Marshall\u2019s request and forwarded the correspondence to Hadley, who then sent it to Barilaro with a \u201cplease explain\u201d. \u201cMs Hurst [one of two Animal Justice party MPs in NSW\u2019s legislative council] is the deputy chair of the committee and given the close working relationship your government appears to be trying to cultivate with the Animal Justice party in this parliament, she may be willing to move this inquiry on your behalf, or on behalf of this government, though I would not be in a position to support such an inquiry,\u201d the committee chairman, Mark Banasiak, a Shooter, wrote back to Marshall. \u201cFurthermore this proposal would have a natural and detrimental flow-on effect throughout rural and regional NSW, and will ultimately lead to the banning of rodeos and animal exhibitions at country shows around the state. It would also place at risk the world renowned Sydney Easter show.\u201d The next day Hadley was on air interviewing Banasiak, while making no bones about what he thought of Marshall. \u201cOf all the people that have been ministers in NSW parliaments since Federation, this bloke is the biggest joke of all time, Adam Marshall,\u201d Hadley said on 2GB. \u201cThere have been some dopes in cabinet and ministry. I think he is on the podium as a gold medal winner when it comes to dopes. \u201cThis will be the thin end of the wedge and that\u2019s what the Nationals need to understand, once they get in bed with the Animal Justice party they\u2019ll catch some fleas.\u201d Barilaro then texted Hadley, who read out the message on air, minus colourful adjectives. There is no love lost between Barilaro and Marshall. The bad blood goes back to when Barilaro was seeking the leadership and Marshall was in another camp. Barilaro\u2019s response to Hadley remains a mystery. Questioned about the missing correspondence, Barilaro\u2019s staff said the minister routinely deleted messages and emails from his phone after reading them. Sadly, the SMS to Hadley was one of the documents Barilaro deleted. From what Hadley read out, Barilaro sought to convince him that the inquiry would be limited and cover only exotic circus animals and dolphin shows. The letters quickly found their way to the Daily Telegraph, which piled on with the mockery of Marshall. But despite Hadley\u2019s criticism, the inquiry has gone ahead and will hold hearings in 2020. It has received several hundred submissions. Whether it leads to changes in the law or the investment in a sea enclosure being sought by the Animal Justice party remains to be seen.

      "bodyText": "The deadly bushfires engulfing Australia\u2019s eastern coast will cost the tourism industry hundreds of millions of dollars, operators say. Images of fire and smoke making front pages around the world risked further damaging the industry by scaring away international visitors, the Australian Tourism Industry Council said. Almost 4,300 insurance claims totalling $297m have been lodged since the main fires began on 8 November, but the bill is set to climb as the full extent of damage is uncovered and more country burns over what is expected to be a dangerously hot weekend. The fires have devastated some of Australia\u2019s key tourism areas, including East Gippsland in Victoria and the New South Wales south coast. On Sunday, Victoria\u2019s Country Fire Authority ordered the evacuation of East Gippsland, which is visited by tens of thousands of tourists every summer. On Thursday the naval vessel HMAS Choules was off the coast of Victoria waiting to evacuate some of the 4,000 people trapped in Mallacoota, unable to leave because roads from the town have been cut off. In NSW, the fires have devastated tourist towns including Batemans Bay and Mogo, destroying hundreds of houses and businesses. On Wednesday, Fire and Rescue NSW also ordered people to evacuate the Kosciuszko national park, including the Thredbo resort, which operator Event Hospitality &amp; Entertainment said would be \u201cclosed until further notice\u201d. The tourism council executive director, Simon Westaway, said the first priority of tourism operators was to help their local communities, but there was \u201can unquestionable mounting impact on tourism from these fires\u201d. \u201cThe summer school holiday period is the high peak season for many of our regional and rural tourism hotspots,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is still too early to fully know and assess the commercial impact but it will clearly run into hundreds of millions of dollars over the near term.\u201d He said the bushfires were getting heavy coverage overseas and he was concerned visitors might be scared off. \u201cAtic is calling on our government tourism authorities to remain vigilant and be nimble and coordinated to any perceived or real impact to future travel or a decision to defer visiting our country for fear of not being open and accessible, or what these fires may be doing to our pristine nature,\u201d he said. \u201cOur industry is terribly resilient but the severity and scale of these fires and their literal strong global reporting and physical impact can\u2019t be ignored over the ensuing period.\u201d Some tourists whose holidays were cut short due to bushfires in East Gippsland have pledged to return. Nick Wright and his family have been travelling from their home in Greensborough in Melbourne to spend Christmas at Lake Tyers beach for 22 years. They spent the night with 550 other tourists in a relief centre at nearby Lakes Entrance on Monday, when fire burned south toward the coast, but returned to Lake Tyers for four more days. They planned to leave on Friday, but Wright said they would be back. \u201cWe want to support the area by coming back,\u201d Wright said. On Thursday, the Insurance Council of Australia said that since 8 November it had declared a catastrophe in 236 postcodes across four states, including areas on the east coast stretching from East Gippsland to the Gold Coast. The ICA said 4,299 claims worth about $297m had been lodged, with 1,485 properties destroyed, but \u201cthese loss numbers are expected to increase as further assessments are undertaken\u201d. Economist Saul Eslake said bushfire damage would not be properly reflected in economic statistics, which \u201ccan give a distorted impression of the impact of natural disasters\u201d. \u201cThe losses \u2013 houses burned to the ground \u2013 don\u2019t show up, the rebuilding does,\u201d he said. \u201cDisasters can, perversely enough, provide a small boost to growth.\u201d But he said the statistics would capture the damage to industries including tourism and agriculture. \u201cThe loss of productivity of that will show up as a negative in national accounts,\u201d he said. \u201cIf livestock is destroyed, that\u2019s beef production that won\u2019t have occurred, or that\u2019s sheep production that won\u2019t have occurred.\u201d He said the impact on the whole of Australia\u2019s economy was likely to be \u201cquite small\u201d, pointing out that the long-running drought has cut just 0.2% from the country\u2019s gross domestic product. The scale of the disaster is also likely to have a drastic effect on insurance premiums. The operator of the Reef casino in Cairns said disaster insurance had already become more expensive. Reef Casino Trust told the stock exchange its insurer reduced its coverage against cyclones, floods and tidal waves and increased its annual premium by $487,000, to $1.3m. \u201cChallenging market conditions in the insurance industry have led to reductions in the insurance coverage available on commercially reasonable terms for certain risks and an increase in premium costs,\u201d executive director Allan Tan said.",

Later the grazier admitted the property was much more difficult to manage than in his great-grandfather\u2019s time because \u201cthe weather has gone to shit\u201d. That chat with the grazier, Williams says, is one example of a \u201csocial barrier\u201d that gets in the way of Australians taking action on climate change. \u201cOne side of his personality denied climate change was real, yet he fully recognised the climate had changed.\u201d Analysis from Australia\u2019s now defunded National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility has ranked research priorities based on their urgency, cost-effectiveness and technical feasibility. The conclusion is that research into social barriers should be given the highest priority to help save the country\u2019s ecosystems from climate change impacts. Williams was the co-ordinator of the facility\u2019s natural ecosystem network, covering climate impacts on land, in freshwater systems and in the marine environment.

There are all sorts of social barriers to us adapting to climate change. \u201cSome are purely the psychological make-up of people that don\u2019t want to acknowledge a problem, some of it is a government more interested in elections every three years, and some is the vested interests of industry that undoubtedly confuse the issues. They are all barriers. \u201cWe are a group of physical scientists and biologists,\u201d Williams says, \u201cbut we came up with this reasoning that we need to do some social research. \u201cWe\u2019ve had highest temperatures ever, and the longest and most intense heatwaves geographically, and we\u2019ve had floods happening at the same time as the biggest drought, and have seen rainforests burning. \u201cWhat\u2019s the social resistance against something that is so in your face, yet people still want to stick their heads in the sand and deny it? It is the social barriers that are stopping us and it is incredibly frustrating.\u201d Adapt to what\u2019s coming Climate adaptation looks at ways to reduce the impacts of climate change that are unavoidable, and is distinct from mitigation, which focuses on reducing emissions. \u201cClimate change mitigation is about avoiding the unmanageable,\u201d says Dr Alistair Hobday, a research director at CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere and a co-author of the analysis. \u201cAdaptation is about managing the unavoidable.

The only example of a project like that in Australia is a pilot study that has moved 35 captive-bred western swamp turtles to new sites in south-west Western Australia. Prof Lesley Hughes, of Macquarie University, and also an author on the analysis, says there has been resistance to \u201cinterventions\u201d like translocation, but this needs to change. Despite 30 years of research looking at how climate change would affect habitats, she says, very little work has been done to protect species. Other priorities identified by the analysis are to make environmental and planning laws more proactive, and to improve understanding of the effects of extreme events on ecosystems. NCCARF was launched in 2008 with $47m of federal government funding over five years, and then a further $8.8m to 2017. A final $300,000 of funding ran out in June 2018, and the facility is now vastly scaled-down and operating through Griffith University. Williams says it is \u201cfrustrating\u201d that NCCARF has not received continued funding when it has built a foundation of research that could be exploited. \u201cWe had got to the stage where in the next five or 10 years we were really going to start to achieve things, and that\u2019s when it got chopped.\u201d",

The Labour membership as a whole isn\u2019t that much to the left, so if the membership is significantly more to the left than Yvette Cooper then that says far more about Cooper than it does about Labour members.</p> <p>It would be good for Andrew Sparrow to comment on this seen as though the \u2018significantly to the left\u2019 of Cooper is his phrase and his inference.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>Perhaps it does. Cooper was beaten in the 2015 leadership contest by someone much more leftwing, and is fair to assume that her not being leftwing (as opposed to, say, competence) was a key factor in her defeat.</p> <p>But Leibowitz may be raising a related question: Have Labour members got more leftwing since 2015, and if so by how much? And it is possible to answer this question because some proper data is available.</p> <p>The YouGov survey of Labour members mentioned earlier (see 9.51am) was commissioned by the <a href=\"https://esrcpartymembersproject.org/\">Party Members Project</a>, which is funded by <a href=\"https://esrc.ukri.org/\">the Economic and Social Research Council</a> and run by <a href=\"https://www.qmul.ac.uk/politics/staff/profiles/baletim.html\">Prof Tim Bale (Queen Mary University of London)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/118711\">Prof Paul Webb (University of Sussex)</a>. Bale and Webb are co-authors, with Monica Poletti, of the recently published book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Footsoldiers-Political-Party-Membership-Century/dp/1138302465\">Footsoldiers: Political Party Membership in the 21st Century</a> and this book contains very detailed information, based on surveys conducted in 2015 and 2017, about what party members think, and how their views changed in the period between the two surveys.</p> <p>One way of establishing how rightwing or leftwing people are is simply to ask them where they would put themselves on the right/left scale (with 10 meaning far right and 0 meaning far left). On this basis Labour members moved by 0.3 points to the left during this period - more than members of other parties shifted lefwards or rightwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5132f9e98812508294c8ba295b3a7fbeec46cff2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5132f9e98812508294c8ba295b3a7fbeec46cff2/0_0_730_275/500.jpg\" alt=\"Self-location on left-right scale by members\" width=\"500\" height=\"188\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-location on left-right scale by members</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Footsoliders, by Bale, Webb and Poletti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another way of measuring this is to ask people a series of questions to establish where they are on the political spectrum. There are two sets of questions that have been used by the British Election Study. The first relates to how the state and society distribute resources, and on this measure Labour members did move left between 2015 and 2017. On this index, Labour members have exactly the same profile as Green party members. Tory and Lib Dem members actually moved further to the left over the same period, but they were starting from a point further to the right on the scale.</p> <p>The figures are in this chart. The key statistics are those in the bottom line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adaad6853cfeeb8a5fbbbbc675c4d1fb54c22699\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adaad6853cfeeb8a5fbbbbc675c4d1fb54c22699/0_0_815_447/500.jpg\" alt=\"Left-right attitudes by party membership\" width=\"500\" height=\"274\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Left-right attitudes by party membership</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Footsoldiers, by Bale, Webb and Poletti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other set of questions relates to liberty/authority issues, and on this measure Labour members also became more leftwing (if you define socially liberal as \u2018left\u2019 compared to socially conservative) between 2015 and 2017. The data is here, and the key figures are those in the bottom line. This chart is more confusing than the previous one because the percentage figures refer to the proportion of members agreeing with the socially liberal response to the question on the left, not with the actual question.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d46b37430f1c44c2a6630f5f7683adf47237b50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d46b37430f1c44c2a6630f5f7683adf47237b50/0_0_818_437/500.jpg\" alt=\"Liberty-authority attitudes by party membership\" width=\"500\" height=\"267\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liberty-authority attitudes by party membership</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Footsoldiers, by Bale, Webb and Poletti</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-02T16:37:20.960Z\">at 4.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e0e0a8e8f08c397226439c7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-02T15:29:33.032Z\">3.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Starmer says he wants to see Labour 'rebuilt ... as trusted force for good'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sky News has managed to track down<strong> Sir Keir Starmer</strong>, the shadow Brexit secretary, to ask him about the YouGov poll that suggests he is favourite to win the Labour leadership.

Here is an extract from <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/01/01/whitehall-woefully-unprepared-dominic-cummings-true-plan-reform/?WT.mc_id=tmg_share_tw\">her article (paywall).</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dominic [Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser] has been reading and thinking about how to transform the public sector for two decades. He does not think it is a distraction, but a prerequisite to delivering even the simplest promises. Without changing how government operates, the prime minister cannot deliver 50m new GP appointments, new train lines, or better bus services. All this and more was promised in the election manifesto (which I helped write) and is crucial to new Tory voters. If the party wants to win again, there can\u2019t be the project overruns and delayed commitments that have symbolised government incompetence and waste for too long.</p> <p>Beyond that, Downing Street wants to run the most dynamic state in the world \u2013 one that gathers the brightest minds to deliver in new agencies focused on innovation, solving the productivity puzzle, and transforming swathes of the country. So delivery and our capacity for transformation, in No 10\u2019s view, need to change. How?</p> <p>Not \u201cpoliticisation\u201d per se. The list of civil servants Cummings admires is much longer than the list of politicians. They will want to employ people they think competent and expert. In the right job, they could be socialists. As long as they literally deliver trains on time. Or figure out nuclear fusion.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wolf also says the current system institutionalises incompetence.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Currently, any official who has spent more than 18 months in a post is seen to have stalled. They are rewarded with promotions to a different job, often in a different department. That is because the civil service prioritises \u201ctransferable\u201d skills over knowledge (ironically while the Department for Education has tried to instil knowledge-based teaching in schools).</p> <p>This has catastrophic effects. It ensures the \u201cPeter Principle\u201d \u2013 where everyone rises to their position of incompetence \u2013 is ever-present. It kills institutional memory and expertise. It allows officials an escape from accountability. Project gone wrong? That was three postings ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is a story summarising what Wolf is saying.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/02/cummings-likely-to-have-big-influence-over-whitehall-reforms\">Civil service told it is 'woefully unprepared' for Cummings' reforms</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Dave Penman</strong>, the general secretary of the FDA, the union that represents senior civil servants, said this morning that Wolf\u2019s arguments betrayed a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding\u201d of how the civil service actually operates. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While painting the civil service as resistant to change might make a good headline, the reality is quite different and the idea that civil servants are rising \u2018to their position of incompetence\u2019 is so wide of the mark it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the realities of the modern civil service.</p> <p>All senior civil service roles are externally advertised and appointed on merit.</p> <p>The so-called \u2018merry-go-round\u2019 that Wolf decries is entirely of the government\u2019s own creation, with a decade of pay stagnation and the removal of pay progression leaving the movement between jobs as the only route to a pay rise.</p> <p>If the prime minister really does want to deliver 50m new GP appointments, new train lines, or better bus services, we need to see a much clearer plan on how these reforms will lead to the transformation promised.

He says that it feels \u201cabout right\u201d as an account of opinion in the party at the moment, but that a lot could change. It is worth reading the article in full, but here\u2019s an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the many, many errors that people make in reporting the Labour party rank and file is imagining that it is a hyper-engaged and incredibly online group of people. This is not the case. The average Labour member is a socially concerned person who gets their news via the Guardian\u2019s website and the BBC. They are also not particularly factional: Momentum, the organisation that grew out of Corbyn\u2019s first leadership election, is the largest factional organisation in Labour politics by some distance: but only one around one in every 10 Labour party members is a Momentum member.</p> <p>The moment when Jeremy Corbyn sealed the deal with Labour members in 2015 was not on Twitter, or even on Facebook. It was in the first televised debate of the race. That was when, <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/07/jeremy-corbyn-course-come-top-labour-leadership-election\">according to the private polling I obtained at the time</a>, he first opened up a lead among Labour members.</p> <p>This is just supposition based on anecdote, but my impression is that there are five candidates in this contest who are well-known and about whom Labour members have strong opinions: Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long Bailey, Yvette Cooper, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry. These candidates have the least room to grow \u2013 I\u2019m not saying it is impossible for them to improve their standing among Labour party members, but they are the ones who are competing against strongly held preconceptions about them.</p> <p>Opinions about Lisa Nandy and Clive Lewis are for the most part up for grabs and therefore they could do much better than suggested by these polls \u2013 if they get on to the ballot, which is not certain for either.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-02T11:40:54.028Z\">at 11.40am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e0dcea68f087e8308e67445\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-02T11:07:15.628Z\">11.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The process to strip Northern rail of its franchise has begun after years of poor performance, <strong>Grant Shapps</strong>, the transport secretary, has said.

And polling party members is harder than polling the public at large, because there are fewer of them. But YouGov can poll Labour members because it has a vast number of people on its database, and in 2015 and in 2016 its Labour membership polls turned out to be reliable guides to the outcome of the two elections that Jeremy Corbyn won handsomely.</p> <p>The fact that Starmer is so far ahead at this stage does not mean he has it in the bag. He has not even announced his candidature yet and a lot could change during the campaign, particularly when candidates face the sort of scrutiny that they have never received before.</p> <p>It is also important to remember that YouGov just polled Labour party members. In the leadership campaign two other categories of people get to vote: people affiliated to Labour through membership of a trade union or a socialist society, and people who pay a one-off fee to get a vote as a registered supporter. Although these two groups are broadly similar in outlook to Labour members, they don\u2019t vote in exactly the same way.

Labour\u2019s national executive committee is meeting next week to determine the timetable for the leadership election, and how the registered supporters scheme will operate for this contest, and, in so far as the NEC is controlled by a particular faction in the party, it is not a faction that wants Starmer to win. </p> <p><strong>Andrew Adonis</strong>, the pro-European Labour peer, is one of the Labour figures who has welcomed the poll findings on Twitter this morning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Andrew_Adonis/status/1212646369258811392\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This poll shows that Labour members want a leader who can inspire them with boldness and realism - not a Corbyn Continuity candidate <a href=\"https://t.co/ppHU85Mhyd\">https://t.co/ppHU85Mhyd</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Adonis (@Andrew_Adonis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Andrew_Adonis/status/1212646369258811392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 2, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But<strong> Steve Howell</strong>, who was deputy director of strategy and communications for Labour in the 2017, has said that Starmer would be the wrong choice.

      "bodyText": "Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has called for Labour to be rebuilt \u201cas a trusted force for good\u201d following its election defeat. He was speaking after the first poll of Labour members since polling day suggested that he would pick up around a third of first-preference votes if he were up against six of the other likely candidates, and that he would eventually beat Rebecca Long Bailey, his strongest rival, by 61% to 39%. (Labour uses the alternative vote in leadership contests, and so the votes of losing candidates are reallocated.) Starmer refused to confirm today that he will be standing, but there is no doubt about what he is planning and a formal announcement that he will be a candidate is expected soon. The DUP has signalled that it will not be rushed into a hasty agreement with Sinn Fein as talks resumed in Belfast on restoring the Northern Ireland assembly and its power-sharing executive. (See 1.55pm.) The two parties need to agree for the executive to be restored. If the devolved institutions are not back up and running by 13 January, the UK government is legally obliged to hold elections for the assembly. Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cseismic\u201d Whitehall reforms, including regular exams for senior civil servants, could lead to discrimination against staff on the grounds of their age and ethnicity, a leading union has claimed. The process to strip Northern rail of its franchise has begun after years of poor performance, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has said. Growing numbers of business leaders in the UK believe Brexit uncertainty will take longer to resolve than Boris Johnson pledged before the election, according to a Bank of England survey. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. And Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP\u2019s new leader at Westminster, also told reporters after the talks about power sharing in Belfast that getting the devolved institutions restored was \u201can absolute priority\u201d for his party. But he said the DUP would not be rushed into an agreement against its interests. He said: We want this done as quickly as possible but we also want to ensure that the agreement is fair and balanced, that it is sustainable, that the political institutions that are restored are sustainable, that we have a lengthy period of political sustainability. We are not in the business of snatching at something because there is a deadline. We want Stormont restored and we want it restored as soon as possible. Sinn F\u00e9in has said it thinks power sharing in Northern Ireland could be restored relatively quickly. Speaking after the resumption of talks aimed at getting the assembly and its power-sharing executive back up and running, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Conor Murphy said there was \u201cno need\u201d for the talks to be drawn out until the 13 January deadline. He said: We think agreement can be reached in short order, we don\u2019t see any need to run this down to the wire to January 13 in some kind of dramatic way. The issues that we are dealing with are all well rehearsed, what we need now is political will to get down to resolving very very quickly and that is going to be our focus in the next day or two. Murphy said there was still disagreement over key issues, including the proposed Irish Language Act and proposals to change the \u201cpetition of concern\u201d procedure that effectively allows both nationalist and unionists a veto over legislation (because measures subject to a petition of concern require cross-community approval). But Murphy went on: There are a range of issues which will be discussed in the next couple of days. None of them, I don\u2019t think, need to be exhausted ad infinitum, we need to be bring this to an conclusion. There are pressures continuing to mount in relation to public health, health services and the treatment of staff in the health service. We need to get back working again so we can fix those as quickly as possible. A Welsh Conservative politician has been suspended from his party after he was arrested by police, the Press Association reports. It is understood assembly member Nick Ramsay was arrested on Wednesday evening at his home in Raglan, Usk, Monmouthshire. The Welsh Conservative party confirmed the shadow finance minister has been suspended \u2013 both from the Welsh Conservative group at the national assembly for Wales as well as from the Conservative party. But the party would not make any further comment. The Liberal Democrats will attempt to get a public inquiry into Brexit when key legislation returns to parliament. Sir Ed Davey, the party\u2019s acting co-leader, has said the party will table an amendment to this effect when the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill returns to parliament on Tuesday. But the government, which has a majority of 80, is not in favour of a Brexit inquiry, and so even if the amendment does get put to a vote, it seems certain to be defeated. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand In the comments below the line (BTL) Leibowitz has asked about my comment earlier about the Labour membership being \u201csignificantly to the left\u201d of Yvette Cooper and suggests that this says more about her than it does about the Labour membership. Perhaps it does. Cooper was beaten in the 2015 leadership contest by someone much more leftwing, and is fair to assume that her not being leftwing (as opposed to, say, competence) was a key factor in her defeat. But Leibowitz may be raising a related question: Have Labour members got more leftwing since 2015, and if so by how much? And it is possible to answer this question because some proper data is available. The YouGov survey of Labour members mentioned earlier (see 9.51am) was commissioned by the Party Members Project, which is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and run by Prof Tim Bale (Queen Mary University of London) and Prof Paul Webb (University of Sussex). Bale and Webb are co-authors, with Monica Poletti, of the recently published book, Footsoldiers: Political Party Membership in the 21st Century and this book contains very detailed information, based on surveys conducted in 2015 and 2017, about what party members think, and how their views changed in the period between the two surveys. One way of establishing how rightwing or leftwing people are is simply to ask them where they would put themselves on the right/left scale (with 10 meaning far right and 0 meaning far left). On this basis Labour members moved by 0.3 points to the left during this period - more than members of other parties shifted lefwards or rightwards. Another way of measuring this is to ask people a series of questions to establish where they are on the political spectrum. There are two sets of questions that have been used by the British Election Study. The first relates to how the state and society distribute resources, and on this measure Labour members did move left between 2015 and 2017. On this index, Labour members have exactly the same profile as Green party members. Tory and Lib Dem members actually moved further to the left over the same period, but they were starting from a point further to the right on the scale. The figures are in this chart. The key statistics are those in the bottom line. The other set of questions relates to liberty/authority issues, and on this measure Labour members also became more leftwing (if you define socially liberal as \u2018left\u2019 compared to socially conservative) between 2015 and 2017. The data is here, and the key figures are those in the bottom line. This chart is more confusing than the previous one because the percentage figures refer to the proportion of members agreeing with the socially liberal response to the question on the left, not with the actual question. Sky News has managed to track down Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, to ask him about the YouGov poll that suggests he is favourite to win the Labour leadership. (See 9.51am.) Judging by the very brief clip just broadcast, he did not seem very keen to discuss the poll. He would not even confirm that he will be a candidate. But he did say he wanted to see Labour rebuilt as \u201ca trusted force for good\u201d. He told Sky: There\u2019s no contest yet. The NEC [national executive committee] will decide this on Monday. For me, the most important thing is that the Labour party is rebuilt, we learn the lessons of the last general election, reflect on them, and address them. But we need the Labour party as a trusted force for good. Mark Serwotka, head of the PCS union, which represents civil servants, has also expressed concern about the government\u2019s plans for civil service reform. (See 2.32pm.) In a statement he said: The major problem for the civil service in the last decade has been under-investment, real-terms pay cuts and poor government policy. Civil servants work tirelessly to make the machinery of government work for the public. However when you shrink the civil service by over 18% since 2010, you are not going to be able to deliver the same level of service. Comments by Dominic Cummings that imply he wants to hire and fire at will reveal an anti-trade union mentality and will be strenuously resisted by PCS. In an article for the Daily Telegraph today Rachel Wolf, a former Tory adviser who contributed to writing the 2019 election manifesto, says that the government\u2019s plans to reform the way the civil service operates are much more radical than many people appreciate. Here is an extract from her article (paywall). Dominic [Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser] has been reading and thinking about how to transform the public sector for two decades. He does not think it is a distraction, but a prerequisite to delivering even the simplest promises. Without changing how government operates, the prime minister cannot deliver 50m new GP appointments, new train lines, or better bus services. All this and more was promised in the election manifesto (which I helped write) and is crucial to new Tory voters. If the party wants to win again, there can\u2019t be the project overruns and delayed commitments that have symbolised government incompetence and waste for too long. Beyond that, Downing Street wants to run the most dynamic state in the world \u2013 one that gathers the brightest minds to deliver in new agencies focused on innovation, solving the productivity puzzle, and transforming swathes of the country. So delivery and our capacity for transformation, in No 10\u2019s view, need to change. How? Not \u201cpoliticisation\u201d per se. The list of civil servants Cummings admires is much longer than the list of politicians. They will want to employ people they think competent and expert. In the right job, they could be socialists. As long as they literally deliver trains on time. Or figure out nuclear fusion. Wolf also says the current system institutionalises incompetence. Currently, any official who has spent more than 18 months in a post is seen to have stalled. They are rewarded with promotions to a different job, often in a different department. That is because the civil service prioritises \u201ctransferable\u201d skills over knowledge (ironically while the Department for Education has tried to instil knowledge-based teaching in schools). This has catastrophic effects. It ensures the \u201cPeter Principle\u201d \u2013 where everyone rises to their position of incompetence \u2013 is ever-present. It kills institutional memory and expertise. It allows officials an escape from accountability. Project gone wrong? That was three postings ago. Here is a story summarising what Wolf is saying. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the union that represents senior civil servants, said this morning that Wolf\u2019s arguments betrayed a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding\u201d of how the civil service actually operates. He said: While painting the civil service as resistant to change might make a good headline, the reality is quite different and the idea that civil servants are rising \u2018to their position of incompetence\u2019 is so wide of the mark it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the realities of the modern civil service. All senior civil service roles are externally advertised and appointed on merit. The so-called \u2018merry-go-round\u2019 that Wolf decries is entirely of the government\u2019s own creation, with a decade of pay stagnation and the removal of pay progression leaving the movement between jobs as the only route to a pay rise. If the prime minister really does want to deliver 50m new GP appointments, new train lines, or better bus services, we need to see a much clearer plan on how these reforms will lead to the transformation promised. Otherwise, we could be left with just another round of reform for reform\u2019s sake. Penman also claimed the civil service had faced much greater challenges than those posed by Wolf in her article in the past. He explained: The reforms trailed in the Telegraph are more modest than the challenges that faced civil servants in 2010. Dealing with a series of reforms led by Francis Maude, the civil service managed to support the first coalition government since the second world war and deliver its radical policy agenda, all while absorbing 20% cuts to resources. Yvette Cooper is not expected to say whether or not she will be a candidate in the Labour leadership election until the weekend, or early next week, according to sources familiar with her plans. She is not responding today to the Daily Mail story saying that she has decided not to contest the Labour leadership because she thinks her opposition to Jeremy Corbyn would make her unelectable. (See 11.43am.) But the YouGov poll of Labour members (see 9.51am and 10.21am.) will do nothing to convince her that this assessment is wrong, and Cooper\u2019s office are certainly not denying the Mail story. I\u2019ve been reminded that in an interview before Christmas Cooper said she had to be realistic about where the Labour membership was on the political spectrum (that is, significantly to the left of her). Talks to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland have resumed in Belfast, the Press Association reports. Here is more from the PA report: The latest process, which was initiated in the wake of the general election, was paused over the festive period after a pre-Christmas deal failed to materialise. The Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, the Irish foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, and the local parties returned to Stormont House this morning to resume the effort. The Democratic Unionist party and Sinn F\u00e9in held separate meetings with Smith, before a roundtable with the other Stormont parties and the Irish government. Further bilateral meetings are expected to continue throughout the day. From Thursday morning a number of protesters stating their opposition to an Irish Language Act being included in any potential deal set up camp outside the talks venue holding aloft union flags. Three years on from the collapse of the devolved government, the Stormont parties have until a 13 January deadline to strike a deal to revive the institutions. On that date, legislation to give civil servants additional powers to run Northern Ireland\u2019s struggling public services expires and Smith will assume a legal obligation to call a snap assembly election. The latest push to restore power sharing broke up the week before Christmas, with UK and Irish governments singling out the DUP as the party standing in the way of a deal. The party rejected the claims, insisting it would not be \u201cbounced\u201d into a quick fix that fell apart when tested. Devolution can only be restored once the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in \u2013 the region\u2019s two largest parties \u2013 agree terms to re-enter a mandatory coalition executive in Belfast. Expectations of a breakthrough rose after the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in both suffered bruising results in the general election. With many interpreting the outcome as a public judgment on the parties\u2019 failure to do a deal, stalled efforts to restore the institutions appeared to gain fresh momentum in December. However, proposals to reform a contentious cross-community voting mechanism in the assembly have emerged as a key sticking point in efforts to finalise an agreement, with the DUP unhappy about what is being countenanced. The DUP is also seeking changes to ensure the devolved institutions are more stable in future and cannot be readily pulled down. Proposed legislative protections for Irish language speakers are another crucial element of the negotiations. The Stormont parties are also seeking firm commitments from the UK government on a financial package to accompany the return of devolution \u2013 money that would likely be targeted at the region\u2019s crisis-hit health service. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said the latest economic survey from the British Chambers of Commerce confirms the UK has suffered \u201ca lost decade\u201d because of Tory policies. In a statement he said: This survey confirms, exactly as the vast majority of economists predicted in 2010, that the Tory economic strategy of austerity and lack of investment would result in a lost decade. It\u2019s not just the uncertainty caused by the government\u2019s negotiations with the EU undermining our economy but 10 years of failed and discredited Tory economic policies. Here are some more tweets on the YouGov poll. From the polling expert Ian Warren From the politics professor Rob Ford Ford has posted a thread on this topic. You can read it by clicking on the link above. Here is one of his conclusions. YouGov included Yvette Cooper in its list of seven potential Labour leadership candidates for its poll of party members. (See 9.51am and 10.21am.) But, according to a story by Jason Groves in the Daily Mail, Cooper is expected to announce that she won\u2019t be standing, because she has concluded that her opposition to Jeremy Corbyn would make her unelectable given how popular he is with members. Groves quotes a \u201cfriend\u201d of Cooper\u2019s as saying: From the way Yvette is talking, she is not going to stand. The way the party is now, it is going to be very difficult for anyone who has criticised the Dear Leader, as she has. It\u2019s ridiculous when he\u2019s just lost us another election. It\u2019s also a crying shame. Yvette is one of the few grown-ups we\u2019ve got left \u2013 she\u2019s probably our best chance. Cooper\u2019s office has not commented yet on the story. Cooper did stand for the leadership in 2015, but came third, behind Corbyn and Andy Burnham. The New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush has written a good blogpost about the YouGov Labour leadership poll. He says that it feels \u201cabout right\u201d as an account of opinion in the party at the moment, but that a lot could change. It is worth reading the article in full, but here\u2019s an extract. One of the many, many errors that people make in reporting the Labour party rank and file is imagining that it is a hyper-engaged and incredibly online group of people. This is not the case. The average Labour member is a socially concerned person who gets their news via the Guardian\u2019s website and the BBC. They are also not particularly factional: Momentum, the organisation that grew out of Corbyn\u2019s first leadership election, is the largest factional organisation in Labour politics by some distance: but only one around one in every 10 Labour party members is a Momentum member. The moment when Jeremy Corbyn sealed the deal with Labour members in 2015 was not on Twitter, or even on Facebook. It was in the first televised debate of the race. That was when, according to the private polling I obtained at the time, he first opened up a lead among Labour members. This is just supposition based on anecdote, but my impression is that there are five candidates in this contest who are well-known and about whom Labour members have strong opinions: Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long Bailey, Yvette Cooper, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry. These candidates have the least room to grow \u2013 I\u2019m not saying it is impossible for them to improve their standing among Labour party members, but they are the ones who are competing against strongly held preconceptions about them. Opinions about Lisa Nandy and Clive Lewis are for the most part up for grabs and therefore they could do much better than suggested by these polls \u2013 if they get on to the ballot, which is not certain for either. The process to strip Northern rail of its franchise has begun after years of poor performance, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has said. My colleague Rajeev Syal has the full story here. The YouGov figures showing how votes might get redistributed in a Labour leadership contest (see 10.21am) are worth studying because they show that some assumptions about how people might use their second preference votes might be wrong. For example, you might think that anyone backing Emily Thornberry would be inclined to opt for Sir Keir Starmer as their next choice because he\u2019s another strongly pro-European north London senior lawyer who performs well in the Commons. But the YouGov figures suggest Rebecca Long Bailey would pick up almost as many Thornberry votes as Starmer in the first instance. The YouGov figures assume Lisa Nandy would drop out after the first round of voting, with her votes being distributed fairly evenly among the remaining candidates. Thornberry would drop out next, YouGov suggests, boosting Starmer by three points and Long Bailey by two points. Clive Lewis would fall out next under this scenario, with his support being split evenly between Starmer and Long Bailey. Yvette Cooper would be the next to be eliminated, YouGov suggests, with half of her votes going to Starmer, and the rest split between Jess Phillips and Long Bailey. And Phillips would be the last person to drop out, with her votes breaking two to one for Starmer. The full YouGov Labour leadership polling figures are not available online yet, but here is the chart showing how votes would be re-allocated in the various rounds of the count. Labour uses the alternative vote system in leadership contests, meaning that people are able to rank candidates in order of preference. If no one gets 50% in the first round, the lowest performing candidate gets eliminated and their votes are redistributed. YouGov can model what might happen because it asked Labour members to rank seven candidates in order. Good morning and happy new year to everyone. It certainly is for supporters of Sir Keir Starmer as next Labour leader. Over the last three weeks he and Rebecca Long Bailey have been seen as more or less joint favourites for the post \u2013 but for different reasons. Starmer has been seen as a likely winner because he is highly regarded by the public at large and if \u201clooking like a credible PM\u201d were the sole criterion for the job, he would probably easily beat the other candidates. But Long Bailey was seen as a likely winner because she was highly regarded by the Corbynites at the top of the party, and it was assumed that if they wanted her in the top job, the pro-Corbyn membership would duly vote for her too. But the first poll of Labour members since the election defeat suggests that the second assumption is wrong, and that Starmer will prove much more popular with members. My colleague Kate Proctor has written it up here. This is how her story starts. Keir Starmer has emerged as an early frontrunner in the Labour leadership race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn after a poll of members suggested he was the first choice in all regions of the UK, age groups and social classes. The shadow Brexit secretary is yet to formally launch his campaign but is expected to do so in the first few weeks of the new year. The new leader will be elected in March after Corbyn said he would step down following the party\u2019s catastrophic general election defeat. Polling by YouGov for the Party Members Project put Starmer as winning with a 61% vote share to 39% for the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, in the last round. Jess Phillips, the chair of the women\u2019s parliamentary Labour party, who has yet to declare if she is running, was the third most popular choice among members, who were surveyed between 20 and 30 December. And here is a Guardian graphic with some of the key figures. It is routine to point out that polling can be unreliable (although that is not something people have been saying since the general election result, which was broadly in line with what the pollsters were predicting). And polling party members is harder than polling the public at large, because there are fewer of them. But YouGov can poll Labour members because it has a vast number of people on its database, and in 2015 and in 2016 its Labour membership polls turned out to be reliable guides to the outcome of the two elections that Jeremy Corbyn won handsomely. The fact that Starmer is so far ahead at this stage does not mean he has it in the bag. He has not even announced his candidature yet and a lot could change during the campaign, particularly when candidates face the sort of scrutiny that they have never received before. It is also important to remember that YouGov just polled Labour party members. In the leadership campaign two other categories of people get to vote: people affiliated to Labour through membership of a trade union or a socialist society, and people who pay a one-off fee to get a vote as a registered supporter. Although these two groups are broadly similar in outlook to Labour members, they don\u2019t vote in exactly the same way. In 2015 and in 2016 the registered supporters were proportionately significantly more pro-Corbyn than members and affiliates. And the fact that this poll has now come out will affect the dynamics of the contest. It will establish Starmer as the clear frontrunner \u2013 and incentivise his opponents. Labour\u2019s national executive committee is meeting next week to determine the timetable for the leadership election, and how the registered supporters scheme will operate for this contest, and, in so far as the NEC is controlled by a particular faction in the party, it is not a faction that wants Starmer to win. Andrew Adonis, the pro-European Labour peer, is one of the Labour figures who has welcomed the poll findings on Twitter this morning. But Steve Howell, who was deputy director of strategy and communications for Labour in the 2017, has said that Starmer would be the wrong choice. Howell does not have a party role at the moment, but his views are always worth paying attention to because they tend to align with those of the \u201c4Ms\u201d \u2013 Seumas Milne, Corbyn\u2019s communications chief, Karie Murphy, Labour\u2019s elections chief, Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, and Andrew Murray, an adviser to McCluskey and Corbyn \u2013 who are seen as four of the most powerful figures in the Corbyn leadership.

I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Yet for decades Whitehall has been an arena of repeated and often radical change. Governments of different colours \u2013 the Conservatives in 1951 and 1979, Labour in 1964 and 1997 \u2013 have come into office suspicious of what they saw as a kind of permanent Whitehall machine, dedicated to maintaining a continuity in policy which politicians are powerless to overthrow. Now, as a result of the 2019 election, Britain has another such government.</p> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s government will soon unveil its own plans for public sector reform. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/02/cummings-likely-to-have-big-influence-over-whitehall-reforms\" title=\"\">In an article</a> on Thursday, the influential Conservative policy adviser <a href=\"http://www.publicfirst.co.uk/our-people/rachel-wolf\" title=\"\">Rachel Wolf</a> makes clear that these are not intended to be cosmetic. Instead, Ms Wolf argues that changing Whitehall will be a major and radical focus of the Johnson era. Too much of the early discussion about the possible changes, she warns, has focused on a departmental reshuffle, with the Brexit department closed down, and changes affecting the Home Office, justice and international development.</p> <p>Important though such changes could be, Ms Wolf sees them as only a fraction of the larger plan crafted by the prime minister\u2019s chief aide, Dominic Cummings.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s civil service is often depicted, in fact and in fiction, as an unchanging monolith. Yet for decades Whitehall has been an arena of repeated and often radical change. Governments of different colours \u2013 the Conservatives in 1951 and 1979, Labour in 1964 and 1997 \u2013 have come into office suspicious of what they saw as a kind of permanent Whitehall machine, dedicated to maintaining a continuity in policy which politicians are powerless to overthrow. Now, as a result of the 2019 election, Britain has another such government. Boris Johnson\u2019s government will soon unveil its own plans for public sector reform. In an article on Thursday, the influential Conservative policy adviser Rachel Wolf makes clear that these are not intended to be cosmetic. Instead, Ms Wolf argues that changing Whitehall will be a major and radical focus of the Johnson era. Too much of the early discussion about the possible changes, she warns, has focused on a departmental reshuffle, with the Brexit department closed down, and changes affecting the Home Office, justice and international development. Important though such changes could be, Ms Wolf sees them as only a fraction of the larger plan crafted by the prime minister\u2019s chief aide, Dominic Cummings. She thinks officials are \u201cwoefully unprepared for what is coming\u201d. This larger plan, of which futuristic inklings can be gleaned from Mr Cummings\u2019s personal blog, is focused on modernisation, systems and delivery. Some of its elements could include recruiting more science and technology graduates, making existing civil servants pass exams in data science and systems, and ensuring that officials stay in departments for longer than the current tendency to move on after 18 months. It would be easy, and to an extent understandable, to react to this radicalism with exasperation. After all, civil service numbers have been cut by a fifth since 2010.

Germany\u2019s VZBV \u2013 an umbrella group of consumer rights organisations \u2013 said it had entered talks about a \u201cpragmatic solution in the interests of customers\u201d but stressed that talks were at a very early stage and would remain confidential. \u201cThere is no certainty that an agreement will be reached,\u201d the consumer body said in a joint statement with VW. Volkswagen has already compensated VW owners in the US and Australia over the manipulation of data about the emissions of its diesel vehicles. It is also facing a class action lawsuit in the UK, where 90,000 of its customers are claiming that the company fitted devices designed to cheat clean air laws to 1.2m cars. The carmaker, which employs 630,000 people, admitted in 2015 to manipulating 11m vehicles worldwide to fool emissions tests. It said last year that total costs relating to the scandal have soared past \u00a325bn, while sales of diesel cars have plunged around the world in the wake of the affair. In the US VW pleaded guilty two years ago to criminal charges and paid out $4.3bn (\u00a33.3bn) in civil and criminal penalties \u2013 the largest levied by the US government against a car company. Last September VW settled a multimillion-dollar class action in Australia over the global diesel emissions scandal and will pay up to Aus$127m (\u00a367.5m) in compensation to customers. Volkswagen made no admission of liability under the agreement. Talks over a settlement to resolve claims in Germany come just three months after the legal case got under way. The trial is being held in Braunschweig, close to Volkswagen\u2019s Wolfsburg headquarters. The regional court had asked VW to consider opening settlement negotiations by the end of 2019. The claim is a declaratory model action, a new form of German legal instrument similar to US class actions or group litigation orders in the UK. The instrument was created to allow collective redress for consumers.

It was indeed a generous act supported by the Liberal MP for Manchester, a mill owner, Sir Tom Bazley, and was part of a wider Manchester campaign for free trade \u2013 best exemplified today by the no-frontier trade of the EU.</p> <p>However, in 1917, unions representing railway workers, miners and engineering workers passed a resolution to stop \u201ccoloured\u201d, Chinese and other foreign workers coming to help Britain produce more arms and food in the first world war. In 1945, Polish soldiers who stayed in Britain were sent down mines to dig vital coal. British miners refused to work with them so separate shifts and even working men\u2019s clubs were set up to keep them apart.</p> <p>In 1968 London dock workers and Covent Garden porters marched to Westminster to support Enoch Powell\u2019s xenophobic demagogy.</p> <p>In our own time there are not a few Labour MPs and trade union leaders who have played into the hands of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage with denunciations of EU citizens working and paying taxes in Britain.</p> <p>Edith Cavell, the British nurse based in Brussels, shot by the Germans as a spy in 1915, famously said: \u201cPatriotism is not enough.\u201d Loving your country and its fellow citizens is one thing, but invoking patriotism with or without an adjective like \u201cprogressive\u201d is dangerous political territory.<br><strong>Dr Denis MacShane</strong><br><em>Former Europe </em><em>minister</em></p> <p>\u2022 After all the build-up, Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s opening statement of intent felt like the political equivalent of the X-Men Dark Phoenix film \u2013 you\u2019re led to expect fireworks and all you get is a damp squib.</p> <p>Long-Bailey has tried to cover all bases and alienate none. We get references to an undefined \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d, alongside \u201cpride\u201d, \u201cdignity\u201d, \u201ccommon purpose\u201d and \u201cpluralism\u201d. This is like an abstracted version of the Labour manifesto \u2013 whatever buzzword you want, it\u2019s there. If this is the kind of hard thinking Labour intends to do between now and the next election, we may be in for a long five years.</p> <p>What does \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d actually mean? I\u2019m proud of the working-class history in this country that encompasses the General Strike and the NHS. I\u2019m not proud of the country that carried out the Bloody Sunday killings and invaded Iraq. I don\u2019t believe it helps us develop a progressive working-class politics to seek to obfuscate over this.

      "bodyText": "Rebecca Long-Bailey (Journal, 30 December) cites, as an example of what she calls \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d, support by Lancashire mill workers in 1862 for Abraham Lincoln\u2019s war to end slavery in the United States. It was indeed a generous act supported by the Liberal MP for Manchester, a mill owner, Sir Tom Bazley, and was part of a wider Manchester campaign for free trade \u2013 best exemplified today by the no-frontier trade of the EU. However, in 1917, unions representing railway workers, miners and engineering workers passed a resolution to stop \u201ccoloured\u201d, Chinese and other foreign workers coming to help Britain produce more arms and food in the first world war. In 1945, Polish soldiers who stayed in Britain were sent down mines to dig vital coal. British miners refused to work with them so separate shifts and even working men\u2019s clubs were set up to keep them apart. In 1968 London dock workers and Covent Garden porters marched to Westminster to support Enoch Powell\u2019s xenophobic demagogy. In our own time there are not a few Labour MPs and trade union leaders who have played into the hands of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage with denunciations of EU citizens working and paying taxes in Britain. Edith Cavell, the British nurse based in Brussels, shot by the Germans as a spy in 1915, famously said: \u201cPatriotism is not enough.\u201d Loving your country and its fellow citizens is one thing, but invoking patriotism with or without an adjective like \u201cprogressive\u201d is dangerous political territory. Dr Denis MacShane Former Europe minister \u2022 After all the build-up, Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s opening statement of intent felt like the political equivalent of the X-Men Dark Phoenix film \u2013 you\u2019re led to expect fireworks and all you get is a damp squib. Long-Bailey has tried to cover all bases and alienate none. We get references to an undefined \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d, alongside \u201cpride\u201d, \u201cdignity\u201d, \u201ccommon purpose\u201d and \u201cpluralism\u201d. This is like an abstracted version of the Labour manifesto \u2013 whatever buzzword you want, it\u2019s there. If this is the kind of hard thinking Labour intends to do between now and the next election, we may be in for a long five years. What does \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d actually mean? I\u2019m proud of the working-class history in this country that encompasses the General Strike and the NHS. I\u2019m not proud of the country that carried out the Bloody Sunday killings and invaded Iraq. I don\u2019t believe it helps us develop a progressive working-class politics to seek to obfuscate over this. Does the notion of \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d make it easier or harder to separate these histories out? In the end, isn\u2019t the dismal key to this statement the line \u201cOver the next few years, our task is to rebuild the broad base of support that will get us into government\u201d? Doesn\u2019t this just mean that the inevitable struggles for day-to-day survival under Johnson should be subordinated to delivering up a Labour government? Isn\u2019t the lesson that Labour needs to learn exactly the opposite of this \u2013 that unless it somehow becomes part of the means of defence of working-class life, within real communities, it will remain irrelevant?

      "bodyText": "British Steel plunged into insolvency 225 days ago. Since then, taxpayers have funded its operational losses of an estimated \u00a31m a day. It doesn\u2019t take a mathematician to see that this can only go on for so long; a deal securing the future of the company\u2019s 4,500 staff needs to be agreed \u2013 and fast. Chinese steelmaker Jingye has been in pole position since November\u2019s announcement that a deal had been agreed in principle. Jingye declared itself willing to pay \u00a350m and invest up to \u00a31.2bn, indicating a bright future for British Steel\u2019s Scunthorpe site, which employs more than 3,000 highly skilled people and supports up to 20,000 more jobs in the area. A month later, the North Lincolnshire constituency voted for the government that had signed the deal, electing a Conservative MP for the first time since 1987. So far so good for Scunthorpe, as well as British Steel\u2019s satellite manufacturing operations in Skinningrove and on Teesside, both also in Tory constituencies. Shortly after the election, the business minister, Andrea Leadsom, met senior officials from Jingye, including its chairman Li Ganpo. What the former City debt trader and the former Communist party official said to one another is yet to be revealed but there is plenty of ground to be covered before they can shake hands and smile for the cameras. Earlier in the British Steel rescue saga, officials let it be known that any buyer would have access to up to \u00a3300m in grants, loans and indemnities to sweeten the deal and spur investment. That is less clear now. Whitehall officials indicate that while Jingye can seek access to government money, there would be no special favours, such as a bespoke package attached to the deal. Instead, any government investment could only come via formal application for pots of money available to anyone, such as the regional growth fund. One reason for this is that Europe\u2019s steel industry body Eurofer has asked the European commission to keep a watchful eye on the transaction to ensure it does not breach state aid rules. European steelmakers are particularly sensitive to this because they have been fighting a losing battle for survival in the face of mass dumping of cheap steel on the market by Chinese rivals in receipt of state subsidies. Anything that looks too much like a taxpayer-funded sweetener for Jingye is likely to be met with opposition from across the Channel. There have also been warnings from the US, where Chinese steel \u201crescues\u201d have allegedly resulted in pay cuts, deteriorating conditions and disruption of trade unions. Steelworkers\u2019 union Community has given a cautious welcome to the prospective owners but wants to know more. \u201cWhat we have heard from Jingye to date is very encouraging but we await the detail of their business plan,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cIt is of course vital for the workforce and communities to retain high-quality jobs going forward and it will be important for the success of the business to ensure terms and conditions remain attractive to the skilled steelworkers who have done all they can to get the business through this challenging period.\u201d There are other potential pitfalls too amid concerns that the longer time ticks on with a sale, the more of British Steel\u2019s regular customers will go elsewhere for their steel, rendering the company a less attractive option. Reports at the weekend suggested the company\u2019s suppliers are also playing hardball, demanding shorter payment terms and better prices. Some observers have raised the usual national security concerns about a strategic asset being sold to a company from China.

Talks with Turkish pension fund, Oyak a deal that raised its own concerns, broke down earlier this year. Liberty House, the steel group owned by UK-based Sanjeev Gupta, retains an interest and waits quietly in the wings \u2013 but for how long?

      "body": "<p>The dependence of the UK gambling industry on high-spending VIPs, customers who are disproportionately likely to be addicts, has been laid bare in a secret report obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>The Gambling Commission is considering whether to ban VIP schemes in Britain after collecting data from betting firms, including one that took 83% of all deposits from 2% of its customers.</p> <p>The report, which has emerged as the government prepares to review gambling legislation, reveals for the first time the extent to which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/02/it-keeps-you-coming-back-the-rise-of-vip-gambling-schemes\">the industry relies on VIP schemes</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/10/gambling-firms-under-scrutiny-for-enticing-loss-making-customers\">much-criticised membership programmes</a> reward gamblers who habitually lose large sums of money with perks such as free bets, cashback on losing wagers or football tickets.</p> <p>The award of VIP status has been cited as a factor in seven out of 10 regulatory penalties issued to companies by the commission for failures to prevent problem gambling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/vipgamblers-zip/giv-3902SFsnO1awjEYE\" data-alt=\"Gambling graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/vipgamblers-zip/giv-3902SFsnO1awjEYE\">Gambling graphic</a> </figure>  <p>A Gambling Commission spokesman said it was already taking action to address poor practice linked to VIP programmes but was prepared to go further.</p> <p>The regulator said: \u201cOperators must improve their interaction with VIPs and we have challenged the industry to make faster progress to improve how they manage their customers. We have also taken robust action against operators who fail to protect consumers and we will be even tougher if behaviour does not change.\u201d</p> <p>The commission collected data on VIP schemes from nine companies that have been granted anonymity but are understood to be among the UK\u2019s largest and best known. In one case, an operator told the commission that while only 2% of its customers are VIPs, they account for 83% of deposits made on the site.</p> <p>One of its rivals took 58% of its betting account deposits from a VIP cohort that made up 5% of its customer base, while a third accepted 48% of deposits from 3% of customers. The data suggests that if the regulator bans VIP schemes, the decision could deal a huge blow to the industry\u2019s revenues.</p> <p>Another section of the report, obtained by the Guardian under freedom of information laws, said VIP gamblers are more likely to be addicts than ordinary customers. The commission estimates there are 47,000 VIPs in Britain, with about 8% of them thought to be problem gamblers. This is more than 11 times the rate among the wider public.</p> <p>The report does not say how many of those gamblers fall under the at risk category, one level below the generally accepted problem gambling classification, but it is likely to be a much larger percentage based on previous data.</p> <p>One section of the report highlights a concern that algorithms used by gambling companies to track betting patterns are far better at identifying people who might be worth granting VIP status to than they are at spotting problem gamblers.</p> <p>In a section considering how to react to the information about VIPs, the regulator suggests several options. They include investigating how VIP staff at gambling companies are incentivised; putting pressure on operators to draw up an industry-wide VIP code of conduct and limiting incentives on offer to scheme members. The document also lays out the option to ban VIP status.</p> <p>The Labour MP Carolyn Harris, who chairs a cross-party parliamentary group on gambling, said: \u201cThis report shows how completely reliant the industry is on people with gambling problems and that they are profiteering from them.</p> <p>\u201cAs the Gambling Commission has itself suggested these practices should be banned to protect problem gamblers and stop the transfer of money from vulnerable addicted gamblers directly into the pockets of the online gambling industry.\u201d</p> <p>Gamblers are typically offered VIP status after losing large amounts of money with one company, which has an interest in retaining them as a customer rather than see them bet with a rival instead.</p> <p>VIPs are often assigned a specialist account manager, who has authorisation to offer perks such as free bets and cashback on losing wagers. In some cases, free gifts including tickets to sports events and even flights are offered.</p> <p>Last year, the Guardian revealed Ladbrokes had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/17/ladbrokes-wooed-problem-gambler-then-paid-victims-1m\">agreed to pay \u00a31m to the victims of a VIP problem gambler</a> who had stolen the money he was using to bet, in return for a pledge not to inform the industry regulator.</p> <p>The bookmaker showered the gambling addict with thousands of pounds worth of gifts over two years, including free tickets to football matches and business class flights.

      "bodyText": "The dependence of the UK gambling industry on high-spending VIPs, customers who are disproportionately likely to be addicts, has been laid bare in a secret report obtained by the Guardian. The Gambling Commission is considering whether to ban VIP schemes in Britain after collecting data from betting firms, including one that took 83% of all deposits from 2% of its customers. The report, which has emerged as the government prepares to review gambling legislation, reveals for the first time the extent to which the industry relies on VIP schemes. The much-criticised membership programmes reward gamblers who habitually lose large sums of money with perks such as free bets, cashback on losing wagers or football tickets. The award of VIP status has been cited as a factor in seven out of 10 regulatory penalties issued to companies by the commission for failures to prevent problem gambling. A Gambling Commission spokesman said it was already taking action to address poor practice linked to VIP programmes but was prepared to go further. The regulator said: \u201cOperators must improve their interaction with VIPs and we have challenged the industry to make faster progress to improve how they manage their customers. We have also taken robust action against operators who fail to protect consumers and we will be even tougher if behaviour does not change.\u201d The commission collected data on VIP schemes from nine companies that have been granted anonymity but are understood to be among the UK\u2019s largest and best known. In one case, an operator told the commission that while only 2% of its customers are VIPs, they account for 83% of deposits made on the site. One of its rivals took 58% of its betting account deposits from a VIP cohort that made up 5% of its customer base, while a third accepted 48% of deposits from 3% of customers. The data suggests that if the regulator bans VIP schemes, the decision could deal a huge blow to the industry\u2019s revenues. Another section of the report, obtained by the Guardian under freedom of information laws, said VIP gamblers are more likely to be addicts than ordinary customers. The commission estimates there are 47,000 VIPs in Britain, with about 8% of them thought to be problem gamblers. This is more than 11 times the rate among the wider public. The report does not say how many of those gamblers fall under the at risk category, one level below the generally accepted problem gambling classification, but it is likely to be a much larger percentage based on previous data. One section of the report highlights a concern that algorithms used by gambling companies to track betting patterns are far better at identifying people who might be worth granting VIP status to than they are at spotting problem gamblers. In a section considering how to react to the information about VIPs, the regulator suggests several options. They include investigating how VIP staff at gambling companies are incentivised; putting pressure on operators to draw up an industry-wide VIP code of conduct and limiting incentives on offer to scheme members. The document also lays out the option to ban VIP status. The Labour MP Carolyn Harris, who chairs a cross-party parliamentary group on gambling, said: \u201cThis report shows how completely reliant the industry is on people with gambling problems and that they are profiteering from them. \u201cAs the Gambling Commission has itself suggested these practices should be banned to protect problem gamblers and stop the transfer of money from vulnerable addicted gamblers directly into the pockets of the online gambling industry.\u201d Gamblers are typically offered VIP status after losing large amounts of money with one company, which has an interest in retaining them as a customer rather than see them bet with a rival instead. VIPs are often assigned a specialist account manager, who has authorisation to offer perks such as free bets and cashback on losing wagers. In some cases, free gifts including tickets to sports events and even flights are offered. Last year, the Guardian revealed Ladbrokes had agreed to pay \u00a31m to the victims of a VIP problem gambler who had stolen the money he was using to bet, in return for a pledge not to inform the industry regulator. The bookmaker showered the gambling addict with thousands of pounds worth of gifts over two years, including free tickets to football matches and business class flights. VIP schemes have also been mentioned in a succession of regulatory punishments handed down by the Gambling Commission. Last year, Betfair was criticised for helping a VIP hide his gambling from his wife. Brigid Simmonds, chair of the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) trade body, said: \u201cOur industry recognises the need to change practices in this area and we will soon publish the terms of a review for a new industry code of conduct. We intend to consult widely on the shape of this new code, to ensure we are always putting the welfare of our customers first.\u201d The BGC launched last year as the industry faced the threat of further regulation after the crackdown on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). The stock market value of UK gambling companies plunged by more than \u00a31bn earlier this year after a report by MPs recommended much tighter controls on online gambling, including restrictions on VIP schemes. The report also called for a \u00a32 stake limit on casino-style slots games, matching the restrictions imposed on FOBTs.",

      "body": "<p>Leslie Baruch Brent, who has died aged 94, was a PhD student at University College London when he co-authored the first of two groundbreaking papers. In 1953 he showed that immunological tolerance \u2013 the capacity to accept an unrelated tissue transplant \u2013 could be experimentally induced. This won lifelong fame for him and his two senior colleagues, Peter Medawar, the team leader, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/dec/02/guardianobituaries.health\" title=\"Rupert Billingham obituary\">Rupert Billingham</a>, a postdoctoral researcher. They were nicknamed \u201cthe Holy Trinity\u201d by American immunologists. We now take for granted that tissues and organs can be transplanted even if the recipient is genetically dissimilar and perpetually takes powerful drugs that suppress the immune response. This was unthinkable in the early 1950s.</p> <p>In the 40s Medawar had proved that \u201cforeign\u201d tissues are usually rapidly destroyed by the same immune system that also fights infections. Billingham, Brent and Medawar began their landmark experiments inspired by previous observations. The US immunogeneticist Ray Owen had shown in 1945 that dizygotic (fraternal) twin calves have red blood cell chimerism, the red blood cells of each mingling with others originating from their twin while in the womb. Owen postulated that precursor red cells must have been exchanged before birth, that the foreign cells had been accepted, and that they had established their own lineage. </p> <p>His observations, largely unnoticed by the immunological community, were replicated by Medawar and Billingham when, for agricultural purposes, they exchanged skin grafts between fraternal calves. To the scientists\u2019 astonishment, such grafts were usually accepted, and it was the discovery of Owen\u2019s earlier paper that made them realise that some sort of tolerance must have been induced in foetal life; a tolerance that extended not only to red blood cells but also to tissues such as skin.</p> <p>Medawar\u2019s team set out to prove the existence of immunological tolerance by experiments using white and brown inbred laboratory mice. Members of each strain are genetically almost as alike as identical twins. The team injected cells from one inbred strain directly into immunologically immature late foetuses of a different strain. When these mice grew up, they were given skin grafts from mice of the strain cell. Many grafts were accepted, but only if they were from the cell donor strain; grafts from mice of an unrelated strain were rejected. They therefore created white mice with patches of brown fur and brown mice with patches of white fur. In scientific terms this was sensational.</p> <p>In 1953 Medawar and Billingham generously asked the young Brent to give the first talk on their work. A packed meeting of the <a href=\"http://www.sebiology.org/\" title=\"Society of Experimental Biology\">Society </a><a href=\"http://www.sebiology.org/\" title=\"Society of Experimental Biology\">for Experimental Biology</a> was excited and astonished by his account and by photographs showing adult white mice carrying healthy brown skin grafts. Shortly afterwards the team published a brief report of their findings in the journal Nature; it was the same year the journal carried Watson and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/jul/30/obituaries.science\" title=\"\">Crick</a>\u2019s paper on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/feb/22/watson-crick-dna-60th-anniversary-double-helix\" title=\"\">discovery of the structure of DNA</a>. The findings of the Medawar group led to an international research explosion in search of the holy grail of tolerance in clinical transplantation. The men published their extended findings, with photographs, in the Royal Society Philosophical Transactions in 1956.</p> <p>In 1967 Brent helped establish the British Transplantation Society as its first general secretary, with Medawar as president. In 2013 the society celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Nature paper by inviting Brent to repeat his 1953 talk, calling its publication \u201cprobably the most important paper in the history of transplantation\u201d. Again, when the Royal Society\u2019s journal celebrated its 350th anniversary in 2015 with analyses of its 17 most influential papers, the findings of Billingham, Brent and Medawar were included.</p> <p>Medawar was <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1960/medawar/biographical/\" title=\"\">awarded the 1960 Nobel prize</a> (jointly with the Australian immunologist Frank Macfarlane Burnet) and immediately shared his prize money with Brent and Billingham, writing: \u201cI wish to make it absolutely clear that it is in no way a present but comes to you as of right.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/31/letter-leslie-baruch-brent-obituary\">Letter: Leslie Baruch Brent obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brent was appointed professor of immunology at St Mary\u2019s Hospital Medical School in 1969, after four years as professor of zoology at the University of Southampton. He later showed that tolerance could be induced in adult animals, using different strategies, and harnessing immunoregulatory T-lymphocytes, which induce tolerance in the normal T-lymphocytes that destroy grafts. During his 20-year tenure at St Mary\u2019s he established a clinical laboratory, encouraged the first research on Aids by his colleague Tony Pinching, and established the University of London\u2019s first MSc course in clinical immunology.</p> <p>Brent was born Lothar Baruch in K\u00f6slin, Germany, which is now part of Poland. His parents, Arthur and Charlotte, were observant though not orthodox Jews and integrated into German life. His father was a childrenswear sales rep who had been awarded the Iron Cross in the first world war.</p> <p>Lothar was forced to leave his school in 1936, aged 11, following racial persecution. His refuge in a Jewish orphanage in Berlin saved his life, as the director nominated him to leave Germany three weeks after Kristallnacht on the first Kindertransport.</p> <p>On arrival at Harwich in Essex, he was taken to Dovercourt, a converted holiday camp. Having learned English at school, he was chosen to take part in a radio programme intended to attract foster families.</p> <p>He had the good fortune to be selected to join Bunce Court, a progressive German-Jewish boarding school in Kent, which its farsighted headteacher had relocated from Germany in 1933. They nurtured and educated him. His fellow pupils included the painter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/frank-auerbach\" title=\"\">Frank Auerbach</a>, the musical humorist <a href=\"http://www.musicweb-international.com/hoffnung/biog1.htm\" title=\"\">Gerard Hoffnung</a>, and the theatre critic and playwright Frank Marcus, author of The Killing of Sister George.</p> <p>His life in Britain was funded by a refugee children\u2019s charity, but when he was 16 it ran out of money, so he became a chemistry lab assistant at Birmingham Central Technical College. Living in digs, he studied part-time and the Red Cross forwarded letters from his parents, which ceased in autumn 1942. At 18 he volunteered for the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, anxious to serve his new country and to aid his family.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/dec/02/guardianobituaries.health\">Obituary: Rupert Billingham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sent for officer training and then as a trainer of soldiers, he was told to change his name; had he been captured, the Germans would have executed him for treason and being Jewish. He chose Leslie after the actor Leslie Howard and Brent from the phone book; many years later he was to add back his original surname of Baruch. He arrived in Italy as the war ended and then joined the British Army of the Rhine.</p> <p>A visit to Berlin to trace his family revealed only that they had been sent east. Years later he learned that in 1942 they had been transported to Riga in packed cattle trucks, a three-day journey, taken into the woods and shot. He had small brass plaques set in the pavement outside their former Berlin home to commemorate his parents and his sister, Eva.</p> <p>Demobbed in 1947, Brent studied zoology at the University of Birmingham. An outstanding sportsman, he was president of the students\u2019 union, designated the outstanding undergraduate of his year, narrowly missed a first, and was invited to undertake research for a PhD by Medawar, his zoology professor.</p> <p>Medawar\u2019s epiphany had been seeing a plane shot down and its pilot badly burned. Burns were a major wartime problem and doctors were baffled that skin grafts from unrelated donors healed brilliantly for more than a week \u2013 and then were rejected.</p> <p>Medawar had shown in the mid-1940s that foreign skin grafts transplanted to burns patients and between rabbits were rejected by an ill-understood immunological process, thus paving the way for the tolerance experiments.</p> <p>Brent retired in 1990 having published A History of Transplantation Immunology (1997), Sunday\u2019s Child?: A Memoir (2009), and more than 200 papers. He received many honours nationally and internationally and was in continued demand at conferences. He was mild-mannered, tolerant and kind, immersed himself in good causes, and remained in good health and intellectually active into his 90s. Psychotherapy helped him deal with his family\u2019s murder. In November 2018 he spoke from the pulpit at Westminster Abbey at a service to mark the 80th anniversary of Kristallnacht.</p> <p>He married Joanne Manley, a teacher, in 1954; the marriage ended in divorce. In 1991 he married Carol Martin, a psychotherapist, who survives him, as do three children from his first marriage, Simon, Sue and Jenny, three stepchildren, Nicholas, David and Sian, and nine grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Leslie Baruch Brent (Lothar Baruch), immunologist, born 5 July 1925; died 21 December 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leslie Baruch Brent, who has died aged 94, was a PhD student at University College London when he co-authored the first of two groundbreaking papers. In 1953 he showed that immunological tolerance \u2013 the capacity to accept an unrelated tissue transplant \u2013 could be experimentally induced. This won lifelong fame for him and his two senior colleagues, Peter Medawar, the team leader, and Rupert Billingham, a postdoctoral researcher. They were nicknamed \u201cthe Holy Trinity\u201d by American immunologists. We now take for granted that tissues and organs can be transplanted even if the recipient is genetically dissimilar and perpetually takes powerful drugs that suppress the immune response. This was unthinkable in the early 1950s. In the 40s Medawar had proved that \u201cforeign\u201d tissues are usually rapidly destroyed by the same immune system that also fights infections. Billingham, Brent and Medawar began their landmark experiments inspired by previous observations. The US immunogeneticist Ray Owen had shown in 1945 that dizygotic (fraternal) twin calves have red blood cell chimerism, the red blood cells of each mingling with others originating from their twin while in the womb. Owen postulated that precursor red cells must have been exchanged before birth, that the foreign cells had been accepted, and that they had established their own lineage. His observations, largely unnoticed by the immunological community, were replicated by Medawar and Billingham when, for agricultural purposes, they exchanged skin grafts between fraternal calves. To the scientists\u2019 astonishment, such grafts were usually accepted, and it was the discovery of Owen\u2019s earlier paper that made them realise that some sort of tolerance must have been induced in foetal life; a tolerance that extended not only to red blood cells but also to tissues such as skin. Medawar\u2019s team set out to prove the existence of immunological tolerance by experiments using white and brown inbred laboratory mice. Members of each strain are genetically almost as alike as identical twins. The team injected cells from one inbred strain directly into immunologically immature late foetuses of a different strain. When these mice grew up, they were given skin grafts from mice of the strain cell. Many grafts were accepted, but only if they were from the cell donor strain; grafts from mice of an unrelated strain were rejected. They therefore created white mice with patches of brown fur and brown mice with patches of white fur. In scientific terms this was sensational. In 1953 Medawar and Billingham generously asked the young Brent to give the first talk on their work. A packed meeting of the Society for Experimental Biology was excited and astonished by his account and by photographs showing adult white mice carrying healthy brown skin grafts. Shortly afterwards the team published a brief report of their findings in the journal Nature; it was the same year the journal carried Watson and Crick\u2019s paper on the discovery of the structure of DNA. The findings of the Medawar group led to an international research explosion in search of the holy grail of tolerance in clinical transplantation. The men published their extended findings, with photographs, in the Royal Society Philosophical Transactions in 1956. In 1967 Brent helped establish the British Transplantation Society as its first general secretary, with Medawar as president. In 2013 the society celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Nature paper by inviting Brent to repeat his 1953 talk, calling its publication \u201cprobably the most important paper in the history of transplantation\u201d. Again, when the Royal Society\u2019s journal celebrated its 350th anniversary in 2015 with analyses of its 17 most influential papers, the findings of Billingham, Brent and Medawar were included. Medawar was awarded the 1960 Nobel prize (jointly with the Australian immunologist Frank Macfarlane Burnet) and immediately shared his prize money with Brent and Billingham, writing: \u201cI wish to make it absolutely clear that it is in no way a present but comes to you as of right.\u201d Brent was appointed professor of immunology at St Mary\u2019s Hospital Medical School in 1969, after four years as professor of zoology at the University of Southampton. He later showed that tolerance could be induced in adult animals, using different strategies, and harnessing immunoregulatory T-lymphocytes, which induce tolerance in the normal T-lymphocytes that destroy grafts. During his 20-year tenure at St Mary\u2019s he established a clinical laboratory, encouraged the first research on Aids by his colleague Tony Pinching, and established the University of London\u2019s first MSc course in clinical immunology. Brent was born Lothar Baruch in K\u00f6slin, Germany, which is now part of Poland. His parents, Arthur and Charlotte, were observant though not orthodox Jews and integrated into German life. His father was a childrenswear sales rep who had been awarded the Iron Cross in the first world war. Lothar was forced to leave his school in 1936, aged 11, following racial persecution. His refuge in a Jewish orphanage in Berlin saved his life, as the director nominated him to leave Germany three weeks after Kristallnacht on the first Kindertransport. On arrival at Harwich in Essex, he was taken to Dovercourt, a converted holiday camp. Having learned English at school, he was chosen to take part in a radio programme intended to attract foster families. He had the good fortune to be selected to join Bunce Court, a progressive German-Jewish boarding school in Kent, which its farsighted headteacher had relocated from Germany in 1933. They nurtured and educated him. His fellow pupils included the painter Frank Auerbach, the musical humorist Gerard Hoffnung, and the theatre critic and playwright Frank Marcus, author of The Killing of Sister George. His life in Britain was funded by a refugee children\u2019s charity, but when he was 16 it ran out of money, so he became a chemistry lab assistant at Birmingham Central Technical College. Living in digs, he studied part-time and the Red Cross forwarded letters from his parents, which ceased in autumn 1942. At 18 he volunteered for the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, anxious to serve his new country and to aid his family. Sent for officer training and then as a trainer of soldiers, he was told to change his name; had he been captured, the Germans would have executed him for treason and being Jewish. He chose Leslie after the actor Leslie Howard and Brent from the phone book; many years later he was to add back his original surname of Baruch. He arrived in Italy as the war ended and then joined the British Army of the Rhine. A visit to Berlin to trace his family revealed only that they had been sent east. Years later he learned that in 1942 they had been transported to Riga in packed cattle trucks, a three-day journey, taken into the woods and shot. He had small brass plaques set in the pavement outside their former Berlin home to commemorate his parents and his sister, Eva. Demobbed in 1947, Brent studied zoology at the University of Birmingham. An outstanding sportsman, he was president of the students\u2019 union, designated the outstanding undergraduate of his year, narrowly missed a first, and was invited to undertake research for a PhD by Medawar, his zoology professor. Medawar\u2019s epiphany had been seeing a plane shot down and its pilot badly burned. Burns were a major wartime problem and doctors were baffled that skin grafts from unrelated donors healed brilliantly for more than a week \u2013 and then were rejected. Medawar had shown in the mid-1940s that foreign skin grafts transplanted to burns patients and between rabbits were rejected by an ill-understood immunological process, thus paving the way for the tolerance experiments. Brent retired in 1990 having published A History of Transplantation Immunology (1997), Sunday\u2019s Child?: A Memoir (2009), and more than 200 papers. He received many honours nationally and internationally and was in continued demand at conferences. He was mild-mannered, tolerant and kind, immersed himself in good causes, and remained in good health and intellectually active into his 90s. Psychotherapy helped him deal with his family\u2019s murder. In November 2018 he spoke from the pulpit at Westminster Abbey at a service to mark the 80th anniversary of Kristallnacht. He married Joanne Manley, a teacher, in 1954; the marriage ended in divorce. In 1991 he married Carol Martin, a psychotherapist, who survives him, as do three children from his first marriage, Simon, Sue and Jenny, three stepchildren, Nicholas, David and Sian, and nine grandchildren. \u2022 Leslie Baruch Brent (Lothar Baruch), immunologist, born 5 July 1925; died 21 December 2019",

This is the year the revolution happens, and that we (the scum) finally fight back against celebrities turning our collective Instagram feeds into a curated series of personalised ads. Someone, sadly, is going to have to be the sacrificial lamb to that. And it\u2019s going to be Antoni from Queer Eye. \u201cI love this simple app for ForEx trading,\u201d Antoni\u2019s going to say, standing perfectly topless in a sauna and holding a big iPhone up towards a camera; and we\u2019re all going to see right through it, through his abs and his subtle body sweat and his big distant goof idiot smile, and we\u2019re going to riot. You don\u2019t believe this powdered almond butter is the best powdered almond butter on the market, Antoni. You don\u2019t really think this bottled water has the ability to \u201cmega-hydrate\u201d? No more booty tea 2K20. If you try to sell me a tooth-whitening pen then we\u2019re going to war.",

      "body": "<p>The lights are bright on Broadway. Blinding even. With 35 plays and musicals now running, Broadway looks likely to have grossed over $1bn in 2019, having played to more than 8 million people. National tours have become de rigueur for every musical that doesn\u2019t absolutely flop and satellite productions pop up across the globe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/03/broadway-in-2019-a-flashy-fractured-year-of-confused-highs-and-lows\">Broadway in 2019: a flashy, fractured year of confused highs and lows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But with big business comes big risk. Running costs remain steep. Most shows fail to recoup. A few New York not-for-profits (Roundabout, Manhattan Theatre Club, Second Stage, Lincoln Center Theater) have Broadway houses, yet even those companies rarely program shows without the reassurance of a well-known star or creator. Both the not-for-profits and the for-profits have been busily making wagers on which known quantities and out-of-town successes will attract New York audiences and the tourist trade. 2019 was fairly lively \u2013 Slave Play, What the Constitution Means to Me, Choir Boy, Freestyle Love Supreme, American Utopia, a recuperated Oklahoma!, Hadestown, Gary (a miss, but still a big swing). But looking ahead to 2020, most of those wagers appear conservative, probably too conservative. Subtract the star casting and only a few plays and musicals will generate much excitement.</p> <p>Of the musicals so far announced, six are new (or newish) and four are revivals. Two jukebox musicals are promised, one relatively innovative and one baffling. In Girl from the North Country, which had a successful run at the Public Theater two years ago, Conor McPherson transposes the songs of Bob Dylan to Depression-era Duluth. Why the playwright Lynn Nottage and the director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon are charging ahead with MJ, a biomusical based around Michael Jackson, remains a mystery, but it seems telling that the production has revised its former title, the innuendo-available Don\u2019t Stop \u2018Til You Get Enough, with the more innocuous MJ.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yZjS1DadLs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7yZjS1DadLs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Queens, princesses, an unlikely drag act and an unlikelier acid trip inspire the other new musicals, such as Six, the hit London power-pop musical about the wives of Henry VIII. It joins Diana, with music by Joe DiPietro and David Bryan, a biomusical about the people\u2019s princess. Following in the high-heeled footsteps of Tootsie comes Mrs Doubtfire, an adaptation of the Robin Williams movie about a divorced dad who puts on a dress to get closer to his children. Perhaps the most original entry is Flying Over Sunset, a new musical with a book by James Lapine and music by Tom Kitt that details the mid-50s LSD experiments of Cary Grant, Clare Booth Luce and Aldous Huxley.</p> <p>If that doesn\u2019t sound like enough of a trip, Katrina Lenk, a Tony winner for The Band\u2019s Visit, will star in Marianne Elliott\u2019s gender-flipped Company, and Hugh Jackman, that great showman, will lead a revival of The Music Man. Ivo van Hove returns the Sharks and the Jets to the stage in a new version of West Side Story, with choreography by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. Sharon D Clarke will reprise the title role in Caroline, or Change, in Michael Longhurst\u2019s celebrated revival of Tony Kushner and Jeanine Tesori\u2019s underrated blues and klezmer musical.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb201f8e1c05928f1af907385cf51a60b9a2b928\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb201f8e1c05928f1af907385cf51a60b9a2b928/0_139_2231_1338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Linney during the My Name Is Lucy Barton photo Call\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Linney during the My Name Is Lucy Barton photo call.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Walter McBride/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s difficult to discern much of a melody in the varied roster of new plays. Two of them, Martin McDonagh\u2019s Hangmen, now starring Dan Stevens, and Stefano Massini\u2019s The Lehman Trilogy, with Simon Russell Beale, arrive after successful runs both in London and Off-Broadway. Two solo shows chronicle the stages of a woman\u2019s life, Elizabeth Strout\u2019s My Name is Lucy Barton, adapted by Rona Munro and starring Laura Linney, and Noah Haidle\u2019s Birthday Candles, starring Debra Messing. Grand Horizons, the Broadway debut of the celebrated off-Broadway writer Bess Wohl, centers on a golden-years divorce. The not-so-happy couple: Jane Alexander and James Cromwell. Tracy Letts, who brought Linda Vista to Broadway in 2019, returns with The Minutes, in which he also stars, alongside Armie Hammer and Jesse Mueller. Directed by Steppenwolf\u2019s Anna D Shapiro, it charts a town council meeting in real time.</p> <p>When it comes to play revivals, producers have stuck to American properties, all of them penned in the last 60 years. It hasn\u2019t been long since Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf and American Buffalo were on Broadway. But here they are again, with Laurie Metcalf (who can never, it seems, not be on Broadway), Rupert Everett, and Russell Tovey attached to the former and Laurence Fishburne and Sam Rockwell to the latter. (One might have anticipated that after Bitter Wheat, the theater might want a David Mamet breather. Not so much.) Paula Vogel\u2019s How I Learned to Drive was recently revived off-Broadway, but it has its keys in the ignition again, this time with its original stars, Mary-Louise Parker and David Morse, attached.</p> <p>Star casting will also gin up anticipation for Kenny Leon\u2019s revival of Charles Fuller\u2019s wrenching drama A Soldier\u2019s Play, now starring David Alan Grier and Blair Underwood, and Richard Greenberg\u2019s comedy-drama of baseball and sexuality, Take Me Out, with Jesse Williams and Jesse Tyler Ferguson. Husband-and-wife Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker star in Neil Simon\u2019s Plaza Suite, playing two couples and one near couple, all occupying the same hotel room.</p> <p>Want to place bets on which shows will still be running this time next year? Ante in.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The lights are bright on Broadway. Blinding even. With 35 plays and musicals now running, Broadway looks likely to have grossed over $1bn in 2019, having played to more than 8 million people. National tours have become de rigueur for every musical that doesn\u2019t absolutely flop and satellite productions pop up across the globe. But with big business comes big risk. Running costs remain steep. Most shows fail to recoup. A few New York not-for-profits (Roundabout, Manhattan Theatre Club, Second Stage, Lincoln Center Theater) have Broadway houses, yet even those companies rarely program shows without the reassurance of a well-known star or creator. Both the not-for-profits and the for-profits have been busily making wagers on which known quantities and out-of-town successes will attract New York audiences and the tourist trade. 2019 was fairly lively \u2013 Slave Play, What the Constitution Means to Me, Choir Boy, Freestyle Love Supreme, American Utopia, a recuperated Oklahoma!, Hadestown, Gary (a miss, but still a big swing). But looking ahead to 2020, most of those wagers appear conservative, probably too conservative. Subtract the star casting and only a few plays and musicals will generate much excitement. Of the musicals so far announced, six are new (or newish) and four are revivals. Two jukebox musicals are promised, one relatively innovative and one baffling. In Girl from the North Country, which had a successful run at the Public Theater two years ago, Conor McPherson transposes the songs of Bob Dylan to Depression-era Duluth. Why the playwright Lynn Nottage and the director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon are charging ahead with MJ, a biomusical based around Michael Jackson, remains a mystery, but it seems telling that the production has revised its former title, the innuendo-available Don\u2019t Stop \u2018Til You Get Enough, with the more innocuous MJ. Queens, princesses, an unlikely drag act and an unlikelier acid trip inspire the other new musicals, such as Six, the hit London power-pop musical about the wives of Henry VIII. It joins Diana, with music by Joe DiPietro and David Bryan, a biomusical about the people\u2019s princess. Following in the high-heeled footsteps of Tootsie comes Mrs Doubtfire, an adaptation of the Robin Williams movie about a divorced dad who puts on a dress to get closer to his children. Perhaps the most original entry is Flying Over Sunset, a new musical with a book by James Lapine and music by Tom Kitt that details the mid-50s LSD experiments of Cary Grant, Clare Booth Luce and Aldous Huxley. If that doesn\u2019t sound like enough of a trip, Katrina Lenk, a Tony winner for The Band\u2019s Visit, will star in Marianne Elliott\u2019s gender-flipped Company, and Hugh Jackman, that great showman, will lead a revival of The Music Man. Ivo van Hove returns the Sharks and the Jets to the stage in a new version of West Side Story, with choreography by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. Sharon D Clarke will reprise the title role in Caroline, or Change, in Michael Longhurst\u2019s celebrated revival of Tony Kushner and Jeanine Tesori\u2019s underrated blues and klezmer musical. It\u2019s difficult to discern much of a melody in the varied roster of new plays. Two of them, Martin McDonagh\u2019s Hangmen, now starring Dan Stevens, and Stefano Massini\u2019s The Lehman Trilogy, with Simon Russell Beale, arrive after successful runs both in London and Off-Broadway. Two solo shows chronicle the stages of a woman\u2019s life, Elizabeth Strout\u2019s My Name is Lucy Barton, adapted by Rona Munro and starring Laura Linney, and Noah Haidle\u2019s Birthday Candles, starring Debra Messing. Grand Horizons, the Broadway debut of the celebrated off-Broadway writer Bess Wohl, centers on a golden-years divorce. The not-so-happy couple: Jane Alexander and James Cromwell. Tracy Letts, who brought Linda Vista to Broadway in 2019, returns with The Minutes, in which he also stars, alongside Armie Hammer and Jesse Mueller. Directed by Steppenwolf\u2019s Anna D Shapiro, it charts a town council meeting in real time. When it comes to play revivals, producers have stuck to American properties, all of them penned in the last 60 years. It hasn\u2019t been long since Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf and American Buffalo were on Broadway. But here they are again, with Laurie Metcalf (who can never, it seems, not be on Broadway), Rupert Everett, and Russell Tovey attached to the former and Laurence Fishburne and Sam Rockwell to the latter. (One might have anticipated that after Bitter Wheat, the theater might want a David Mamet breather. Not so much.) Paula Vogel\u2019s How I Learned to Drive was recently revived off-Broadway, but it has its keys in the ignition again, this time with its original stars, Mary-Louise Parker and David Morse, attached. Star casting will also gin up anticipation for Kenny Leon\u2019s revival of Charles Fuller\u2019s wrenching drama A Soldier\u2019s Play, now starring David Alan Grier and Blair Underwood, and Richard Greenberg\u2019s comedy-drama of baseball and sexuality, Take Me Out, with Jesse Williams and Jesse Tyler Ferguson. Husband-and-wife Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker star in Neil Simon\u2019s Plaza Suite, playing two couples and one near couple, all occupying the same hotel room. Want to place bets on which shows will still be running this time next year? Ante in.",

The gist of it is this: when people perceive an increase in disorder, they feel tremendous anxiety. Inevitably, this anxiety leads to a quest for security. To bring a sense of safety back into their lives, they latch on to authoritarianism and conformity. As Fromm noted, this often leads to \u201ca readiness to accept any ideology and any leader if only he offers a political structure and symbols which allegedly give meaning and order to an individual\u2019s life\u201d. He had observed this in Germany, which he fled in 1933: \u201cModern man still is anxious and tempted to surrender his freedom to dictators of all kinds,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Fromm was speculating about this dynamic.

They also responded to statements aimed at gauging their desire for stricter rules and their support for different political candidates, including Trump. We conducted the <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-cultural-fault-line-that-is-reshaping-global-politics/\" title=\"\">same survey in 2017 in France</a>, measuring support for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\" title=\"\">Marine Le Pen</a>.</p> <p>The results of both studies were telling: people who felt threatened wanted to tighten up \u2013 to have stricter rules \u2013 which predicted their support for Trump or Le Pen in the US and France, respectively. Other research confirms the same pattern. Economic threats and the growing gap between the rich and poor also create a sense of chaos and instability.

      "bodyText": "Japanese authorities have issued an Interpol wanted notice for Carlos Ghosn, as the former Nissan and Renault chairman released a statement denying his wife or family were involved in his dramatic flight from corruption charges in Japan. The international policing organisation\u2019s \u201cred notice\u201d alerts forces around the world that a person is wanted, in this case by Japanese police. Interpol does not have any powers to force its members to comply with a red notice and it is not an arrest warrant, but it could impede Ghosn\u2019s international travel if other countries sought to enforce it. Lebanon\u2019s justice minister confirmed the notice had been received in an interview with Associated Press. Ghosn on Tuesday revealed he had arrived in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, after complaining he had been \u201cheld hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system\u201d. The details of the escape remain unclear but Ghosn issued a statement on Thursday denying his wife, Carole, or other family members had any involvement in the plot, which could place participants in legal peril. Speculation that they were involved \u201cis inaccurate and false\u201d, Ghosn said. \u201cI alone arranged for my departure. My family had no role whatsoever.\u201d His flight has sparked multiple investigations into how the former corporate titan evaded supervision to leave Japan on a private jet, stop briefly at Turkey\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk airport and then fly to Beirut. Officials from the Tokyo district public prosecutors office raided Ghosn\u2019s former residence in Tokyo on Thursday to look for evidence. In Turkey, seven people were arrested on Thursday as part of investigations.

Adrien Brody plays Arthur Miller and Bobby Cannavale is Joe DiMaggio. This project has been around for a while, with Naomi Watts originally linked to the lead, before she was \u2013 briefly \u2013 replaced by Jessica Chastain.</p> <h2>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</h2> <p>Chastain has instead gone a little more left-field with this fabulous-sounding spin on a 2000 documentary about televangelists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/24/guardianobituaries.usa\">Tammy Faye Messner</a> and Jim Bakker (Andrew Garfield). Tammy Faye (her marriages meant multiple surnames) was a singer, author, talk show host and TV personality who, with then husband Bakker, hosted a small screen puppet show, promoted Christian worship on TV and taped hymn-based albums. The pair also built Heritage USA, a Christian theme park, but this was shut after Bakker was imprisoned in 1989 after being convicted of fraud and conspiracy.</p> <h2>Minamata</h2> <p>A new direction for Johnny Depp as he plays war photographer W Eugene Smith in this movie based on his book documenting the devastating effects of mercury poisoning in Japanese coastal communities. Director Andrew Levitas\u2019s only previous movie was Lullaby, a 2014 drama about the impact on a family when a patriarch decides to switch off his life support.</p> <h2>Hillbilly Elegy</h2> <p>Amy Adams stars in this Ron Howard adaptation of the family memoir by JD Vance about struggle, deprivation, laziness and love in small-town Ohio. The bestseller was cited as a key text of the 2016 election, as Vance writes compassionately about a low-income white working-class clan who played a part in Donald Trump\u2019s election. Glenn Close and Bo Hopkins play Mawmaw and Papaw.</p>",

Louis Wain Will Sharpe, the actor/director behind projects such as Black Pond and Flowers is the man in charge of our second biopic featuring Benedict Cumberbatch, this one of 19th-century artist Louis Wain. Wain, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder later in life, specialised in paintings of big-eyed anthropomorphised cats. Claire Foy plays his sister\u2019s governess, 10 years his senior, who Wain married but who died young. Wain\u2019s gifts emerged during her illness, when she was comforted by sketches he drew for her of their kitten, Peter. Bernstein Cary Fukunaga\u2019s biopic starring Jake Gyllenhaal lost out on the rights to Bernstein\u2019s music to this rival movie, directed by and starring Bradley Cooper. It\u2019s unknown who the only credited co-star, Carey Mulligan, will be playing, or how Josh Singer\u2019s script will juggle Bernstein\u2019s extraordinary career and prodigious private life. Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg are producers, for added wallop. Blonde Potentially the busiest actor of 2020, Ana de Armas plays Marilyn Monroe in Andrew Dominik\u2019s adaptation of the Joyce Carol Oates novel. Adrien Brody plays Arthur Miller and Bobby Cannavale is Joe DiMaggio. This project has been around for a while, with Naomi Watts originally linked to the lead, before she was \u2013 briefly \u2013 replaced by Jessica Chastain. The Eyes of Tammy Faye Chastain has instead gone a little more left-field with this fabulous-sounding spin on a 2000 documentary about televangelists Tammy Faye Messner and Jim Bakker (Andrew Garfield). Tammy Faye (her marriages meant multiple surnames) was a singer, author, talk show host and TV personality who, with then husband Bakker, hosted a small screen puppet show, promoted Christian worship on TV and taped hymn-based albums. The pair also built Heritage USA, a Christian theme park, but this was shut after Bakker was imprisoned in 1989 after being convicted of fraud and conspiracy. Minamata A new direction for Johnny Depp as he plays war photographer W Eugene Smith in this movie based on his book documenting the devastating effects of mercury poisoning in Japanese coastal communities. Director Andrew Levitas\u2019s only previous movie was Lullaby, a 2014 drama about the impact on a family when a patriarch decides to switch off his life support. Hillbilly Elegy Amy Adams stars in this Ron Howard adaptation of the family memoir by JD Vance about struggle, deprivation, laziness and love in small-town Ohio. The bestseller was cited as a key text of the 2016 election, as Vance writes compassionately about a low-income white working-class clan who played a part in Donald Trump\u2019s election. Glenn Close and Bo Hopkins play Mawmaw and Papaw.",

      "body": "<p>One sunny afternoon, when I was around 13 or 14, I was walking down Tottenham High Road hand-in-hand with one of my uncles. He wasn\u2019t a blood relative but, like many of the older men in my community, I called him uncle. I was born in Kinshasa in the Congo, a society in which men hold hands to show the affection and bond we feel for each other. As we walked on to his housing estate, a group of teenagers spotted us. I could see the looks of disgust on their faces. I heard one of them call out: \u201cYo, big man. You holding hands, yeah.\u201d I looked over. His eyes punched through my chest. I felt my legs shake as if my knees were going to buckle. I can still remember the sting in my heart. The experience made me question what \u201cnormal\u201d was, and highlighted contradictions in my own sense of masculinity. </p> <p>I had a good childhood. I had a close family and felt love. But as I got older, I struggled with my mental health. From around 18 until my mid-20s, I experienced depression, anxiety and social isolation. When making a phone call, I\u2019d have to rehearse the conversation before I could pick up and dial. There would be times when, if I didn\u2019t want attention, I\u2019d just avoid a situation altogether. At university, if I was late to a lecture, I just wouldn\u2019t go in \u2013 pushing those doors open and letting people see me was the worst feeling in the world.</p> <p>I eventually realised that my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/24/australian-society-is-obsessed-with-masculinity-and-its-making-me-tired\" title=\"\">issues with masculinity</a>, and not having an outlet for some of these emotions, were part of the problem.

Violence became normal.</p> <p>For a long time I felt completely alone. There were no men I could speak to openly about this.

She also predicts that civil servants will be \u201creoriented to the public\u201d rather than \u201cstakeholders\u201d.</p> <p>Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, which represents Whitehall\u2019s most senior civil servants, including permanent secretaries, pointed out that a new government claiming it will transform Whitehall is \u201cnothing new and somewhat expected\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhile painting the civil service as resistant to change might make a good headline, the reality is quite different and the idea that civil servants are rising \u2018to their position of incompetence\u2019 is so wide of the mark it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding.</p> <p>\u201cThe so-called \u2018merry-go-round\u2019 that Wolf decries is entirely of the government\u2019s own creation, with a decade of pay stagnation and the removal of pay progression leaving the movement between jobs as the only route to a pay rise,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Government sources have confirmed reports that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/02/mark-sedwill-the-pm-theresa-may-trusted-adviser-with-key-role-in-gavin-williamson-sacking\">Mark Sedwill</a>, the cabinet secretary, is expected to oversee a powerful new business department as part of a slew of expected departmental changes after the UK leaves the EU on 31 January.</p> <p>The Foreign Office is expected to absorb the Department for International Development, to align overseas aid with diplomatic goals. Officials say they could set up a new energy and climate change department.</p> <p>Stephen Barclay\u2019s Department for Exiting the European Union is expected to be closed down, with responsibility for negotiations over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU being led by the Cabinet Office.</p> <p>Cummings, credited with devising the Conservatives\u2019 election strategy that swept Johnson to victory, has been a long-term critic of Whitehall. In a 2014 lecture, he complained that \u201calmost no one is ever fired\u201d in Whitehall and set out a \u201cto-do list\u201d he had drawn up in case \u201cI ever manage to get control of No 10.\u201d</p> <p>Another possible change includes splitting off responsibility for the UK\u2019s borders and immigration from the Home Office into a standalone department.</p>",

The union Prospect said a previous attempt to test staff\u2019s skills resulted in a \u00a31m payout to civil servants after legal counsel alleged that success rates for black and minority ethnic (BME) workers, or those older than 35, had been significantly lower than that of other employees. It follows accusations that senior government officials are \u201cwoefully unprepared\u201d for sweeping changes being prepared by the prime minister and his special adviser, Dominic Cummings. Rachel Wolf, who helped to write Johnson\u2019s election-winning manifesto, wrote on Wednesday that civil servants could be made to take regular exams to prove that they are up to their jobs and that changes would end the \u201cmerry-go-round\u201d of officials changing jobs every 18 months. This is in addition to a restructuring of Whitehall departments that was briefed by Downing Street sources last month. Prospect\u2019s deputy general secretary, Garry Graham, whose union represents government-employed specialists and scientists, said a previous test applied to Home Office staff before promotion was discriminatory. \u201cThe idea of annual exams may be a good headline, but it risks putting the cart before the horse and introducing more bureaucracy and potential discrimination into the system,\u201d he said. In March, the government paid out \u00a31m to 49 Home Office employees who had been told they would need to undertake a core skills assessment (CSA) if they were to be considered for promotion, which they all subsequently failed. CSAs have been long criticised by unions that support Home Office staff, which say success rates for BME workers, or those older than 35, have been significantly lower than that of other employees. Tribunal claims were initiated against the Home Office, which disputed the claims but agreed partway through the hearing, on 27 February, to settle, without admission of liability, and pay the claimants compensation totalling more than \u00a31m. Graham also questioned whether the new reforms announced by \u201cdiktat\u201d will be successful without consultation of staff. \u201cUltimately any civil service reform package stands the best chance of success if it is conceived together with civil servants, rather than issued by diktat from the centre,\u201d he said. In an article for the Daily Telegraph, Wolf stated that anyone staying in the same job for longer than 18 months is currently seen to have \u201cstalled\u201d in a culture that ensures \u201ceveryone rises to their position of incompetence\u201d. She also predicts that civil servants will be \u201creoriented to the public\u201d rather than \u201cstakeholders\u201d. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, which represents Whitehall\u2019s most senior civil servants, including permanent secretaries, pointed out that a new government claiming it will transform Whitehall is \u201cnothing new and somewhat expected\u201d. \u201cWhile painting the civil service as resistant to change might make a good headline, the reality is quite different and the idea that civil servants are rising \u2018to their position of incompetence\u2019 is so wide of the mark it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding. \u201cThe so-called \u2018merry-go-round\u2019 that Wolf decries is entirely of the government\u2019s own creation, with a decade of pay stagnation and the removal of pay progression leaving the movement between jobs as the only route to a pay rise,\u201d he said. Government sources have confirmed reports that Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, is expected to oversee a powerful new business department as part of a slew of expected departmental changes after the UK leaves the EU on 31 January. The Foreign Office is expected to absorb the Department for International Development, to align overseas aid with diplomatic goals. Officials say they could set up a new energy and climate change department. Stephen Barclay\u2019s Department for Exiting the European Union is expected to be closed down, with responsibility for negotiations over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU being led by the Cabinet Office. Cummings, credited with devising the Conservatives\u2019 election strategy that swept Johnson to victory, has been a long-term critic of Whitehall. In a 2014 lecture, he complained that \u201calmost no one is ever fired\u201d in Whitehall and set out a \u201cto-do list\u201d he had drawn up in case \u201cI ever manage to get control of No 10.\u201d Another possible change includes splitting off responsibility for the UK\u2019s borders and immigration from the Home Office into a standalone department.",

In September, a government-commissioned report into the future of Britain\u2019s protected landscapes criticised national parks for not doing enough to make people welcome.

Keswick town council has previously condemned an \u00a38m project to create an accessible multi-user trail with a tarmac surface between Keswick and Threlkeld and passed a vote of no confidence in the LDNPA. The scheme, which will be completed at the end of 2020, was designed to replace a traditional stone-surfaced path that was destroyed by Storm Desmond in 2015. In November England\u2019s largest national park received a highly critical letter from advisers to Unesco, which granted it world heritage status in 2017 after a 20-year campaign. The problem of off-road vehicles is particularly acute in Tilberthwaite valley and the valleys surrounding the villages of Little Langdale and Elterwater, and local people have been lobbying for a ban with the backing of the National Trust and a petition signed by more than 350,000 people. Despite this, in October the LDNPA decided to continue allowing recreational off-road vehicles on dozens of farm tracks on this land \u2013 much of it once owned by Beatrix Potter and described by the writer and fell walker Alfred Wainwright as \u201cthe loveliest in Lakeland\u201d.",

He may well be right. Thousands of people pour into the city from all over the world to take part in the huge variety of events that mark the new year festival. Christmas celebrations were banned in Scotland between 1640 and 1712, and the day itself was not made a public holiday until 1958 \u2013 but new year festivities are deep in the nation\u2019s DNA.</p> <p>This year\u2019s Hogmanay, however, begins under a shadow.

In the autumn I wrote to the necessary parties in this with what\u2019s called a request for proposal.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s simply where you take action. There are a couple of ways that can go. But one is to strip a franchise, one is to have a short-term contract. But yes, exactly as you\u2019ve said, I\u2019m simply not prepared for the service on Northern to carry on as it is and I am taking action.\u201d</p> <p>Shapps told the Commons transport select committee in October that the first steps had been taken towards taking the Northern rail network back into public hands.</p> <p>He said he had asked the Northern franchisee, the German-owned Arriva, and the government\u2019s operator of last resort to draw up proposals to improve the service.</p> <p>Highlighting that barely one in two Northern trains ran on time, Shapps said: \u201cI consider that it cannot continue delivering in the current delivery method.\u201d</p> <p>The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: \u201cArriva Rail North should have been stripped of its franchise years ago following its woeful performance and treatment of passengers.</p> <p>\u201cThe Tories stood by as the company ran the service into the ground. They failed to hold Arriva to the terms of its contract and yet again passengers and taxpayers will pay the price.\u201d</p> <p>Rail union RMT, which has long been in dispute with Northern over the role of guards, said Shapps was \u201cbig on talk about Northern Rail this morning but short on detail\u201d. The general secretary, Mick Cash, called on Shapps to set out a clear timetable for removing the franchise from Arriva, accusing the transport secretary of trying to distract from continued fare rises.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \u201cAs the transport secretary said, he has started a process which would either strip Northern of its franchise or to issue a short-term contract to them.</p> <p>\u201cWe are taking action to ensure passengers in the north get a better service and we will provide an update in due course.\u201d</p> <p>There was an average 2.7% rise overall on Thursday, and a 2.8% rise on many season tickets, meaning many commuters face an increase of more than \u00a3100 for annual passes.</p> <p>There were protests at a number of stations including King\u2019s Cross in London, where members of the RMT union gathered at the front of the commuter hub, holding signs reading \u201cCut fares, not staff\u201d and \u201cPrivatisation is not progress\u201d.</p> <p>The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said Shapps\u2019 comments were welcome but he was concerned that a possible new contract for Arriva was still on the table. It would be \u201ca reward for failure and completely unacceptable\u201d, he added.</p> <p>He added: \u201cI call on the government to rule it out, put our rail services under public control and work with us towards Greater Manchester taking devolved control.\u201d</p> <p>Northern has been beset by problems, including the breakdown in industrial relations, and suffered more than most networks after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/09/uk-railways-great-timetable-fiasco-whats-gone-wrong\">botched introduction of a new timetable in May 2018</a>.</p> <p>While Network Rail, the owner and operator of Britain\u2019s rail infrastructure, accepted much of the immediate blame for engineering delays and the rescheduling process, Northern has failed to restore punctuality this year.</p> <p>Northern has blamed factors outside its control for the problems. David Brown, the managing director, said in October it had faced \u201cseveral material and unprecedented challenges\u201d of which the most significant was delayed upgrades to infrastructure and an electrification programme.</p> <p>\u201cThese factors \u2013 alongside the damage caused by strike action and lower than expected economic growth \u2013 have had a significant effect on the revenue expected in our original franchise business plan agreed with government back in 2015,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He added that Arriva and Northern were investing \u00a3600m and \u201cremain fully committed to delivering the transformation of the north\u2019s railways\u201d.</p> <p>Such assurances have failed to mollify northern leaders, with the mayor of Liverpool, Steve Rotheram, joining Burnham in calling for the franchise to be taken into public ownership.</p> <p>Calls for action have started to extend to the neighbouring franchise, TransPennine Express, which operates faster connections between northern cities. After widespread problems in 2018, it has again seen extraordinarily poor performance in recent weeks, with barely one in two trains running on time since the introduction of a new timetable in December.</p> <p>The Northern Powerhouse Partnership thinktank said TransPennine Express were \u201cequally as bad if not worse\u201d than Northern, and should be treated the same by Shapps.</p> <p>The director, Henri Murison, said: \u201cThe same process under way for Northern should be triggered with TransPennine for their unacceptable performance levels. The key issue is what happens next.\u201d</p> <p>Reported plans to split the current Northern franchise into two businesses was \u201ca knee-jerk response and would likely make problems worse\u201d, he added.</p> <p>Northern would be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/16/east-coast-rail-line-to-be-temporarily-renationalised-virgin-stagecoach\">second service to be returned into public ownership</a> under the Conservative government, after the collapse of Virgin Trains East Coast, now run as LNER under the Department for Transport\u2019s operator of last resort.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The process to strip Northern rail of its franchise has begun after years of poor performance, the transport secretary has said. Grant Shapps told the BBC he had started the process that could result in removing the firm\u2019s routes, calling its service \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. It follows a year of chaos and cancellations across the network, which runs from Newcastle to Leeds, Liverpool, Hull, Manchester and Stoke. Millions of commuters will have to pay an average of 2.7% more for train tickets from Thursday. Asked whether his intention was for the firm to be removed from the franchise, Shapps said: \u201cThat\u2019s right. In the autumn I wrote to the necessary parties in this with what\u2019s called a request for proposal. \u201cAnd that\u2019s simply where you take action. There are a couple of ways that can go. But one is to strip a franchise, one is to have a short-term contract. But yes, exactly as you\u2019ve said, I\u2019m simply not prepared for the service on Northern to carry on as it is and I am taking action.\u201d Shapps told the Commons transport select committee in October that the first steps had been taken towards taking the Northern rail network back into public hands. He said he had asked the Northern franchisee, the German-owned Arriva, and the government\u2019s operator of last resort to draw up proposals to improve the service. Highlighting that barely one in two Northern trains ran on time, Shapps said: \u201cI consider that it cannot continue delivering in the current delivery method.\u201d The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: \u201cArriva Rail North should have been stripped of its franchise years ago following its woeful performance and treatment of passengers. \u201cThe Tories stood by as the company ran the service into the ground. They failed to hold Arriva to the terms of its contract and yet again passengers and taxpayers will pay the price.\u201d Rail union RMT, which has long been in dispute with Northern over the role of guards, said Shapps was \u201cbig on talk about Northern Rail this morning but short on detail\u201d. The general secretary, Mick Cash, called on Shapps to set out a clear timetable for removing the franchise from Arriva, accusing the transport secretary of trying to distract from continued fare rises. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \u201cAs the transport secretary said, he has started a process which would either strip Northern of its franchise or to issue a short-term contract to them. \u201cWe are taking action to ensure passengers in the north get a better service and we will provide an update in due course.\u201d There was an average 2.7% rise overall on Thursday, and a 2.8% rise on many season tickets, meaning many commuters face an increase of more than \u00a3100 for annual passes. There were protests at a number of stations including King\u2019s Cross in London, where members of the RMT union gathered at the front of the commuter hub, holding signs reading \u201cCut fares, not staff\u201d and \u201cPrivatisation is not progress\u201d. The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said Shapps\u2019 comments were welcome but he was concerned that a possible new contract for Arriva was still on the table. It would be \u201ca reward for failure and completely unacceptable\u201d, he added. He added: \u201cI call on the government to rule it out, put our rail services under public control and work with us towards Greater Manchester taking devolved control.\u201d Northern has been beset by problems, including the breakdown in industrial relations, and suffered more than most networks after the botched introduction of a new timetable in May 2018. While Network Rail, the owner and operator of Britain\u2019s rail infrastructure, accepted much of the immediate blame for engineering delays and the rescheduling process, Northern has failed to restore punctuality this year. Northern has blamed factors outside its control for the problems. David Brown, the managing director, said in October it had faced \u201cseveral material and unprecedented challenges\u201d of which the most significant was delayed upgrades to infrastructure and an electrification programme. \u201cThese factors \u2013 alongside the damage caused by strike action and lower than expected economic growth \u2013 have had a significant effect on the revenue expected in our original franchise business plan agreed with government back in 2015,\u201d he said. He added that Arriva and Northern were investing \u00a3600m and \u201cremain fully committed to delivering the transformation of the north\u2019s railways\u201d. Such assurances have failed to mollify northern leaders, with the mayor of Liverpool, Steve Rotheram, joining Burnham in calling for the franchise to be taken into public ownership. Calls for action have started to extend to the neighbouring franchise, TransPennine Express, which operates faster connections between northern cities. After widespread problems in 2018, it has again seen extraordinarily poor performance in recent weeks, with barely one in two trains running on time since the introduction of a new timetable in December. The Northern Powerhouse Partnership thinktank said TransPennine Express were \u201cequally as bad if not worse\u201d than Northern, and should be treated the same by Shapps. The director, Henri Murison, said: \u201cThe same process under way for Northern should be triggered with TransPennine for their unacceptable performance levels. The key issue is what happens next.\u201d Reported plans to split the current Northern franchise into two businesses was \u201ca knee-jerk response and would likely make problems worse\u201d, he added. Northern would be the second service to be returned into public ownership under the Conservative government, after the collapse of Virgin Trains East Coast, now run as LNER under the Department for Transport\u2019s operator of last resort.",

In March 2018 the brothers were presented with an award by the Non-League Paper at a special evening at Chelsea FC. The nomination from Corinthian-Casuals praised them as \u201cunsung heroes \u2026 the absolute lifeblood of our great and historic club\u201d. Roger is survived by Brian and by three cousins.",

It\u2019s hoped that the extra liquidity will prevent growth slowing in 2020 European stocks followed suit on their first day of trading in 2020, with the FTSE 100 given an extra boost by a weaker pound which was weakened by Brexit jitters Disappointing manufacturing data was released by both the UK and eurozone economies The final reading for eurozone manufacturing PMI for December came in at 46.3, contracting for the 11th straight month The final reading for UK manufacturing PMI for December came in at 47.5. That was the second weakest level for nearly seven and a half years, having hit 47.4 in August this year Bucking the trend was the US manufacturing sector, which posted a PMI reading of 52.4 in December, though that was down slightly from 52.6 in November. M&amp;G Investments confirmed its UK property fund will stay gated until further notice, meaning investor cash is still trapped US weekly jobless claims fell to 222,000 for the week of 28 December, down from from 224,000 a week earlier. That is lower than consensus estimates for 225,000 In the final round of manufacturing PMI out today, US factory output came in at 52.4 in December, down slightly from 52.6 in November. That was in line with flash estimates. IHS Markit notes: The latest data indicated a modest improvement in the health of the US manufacturing sector. The final quarterly average of 2019 was in fact the strongest since the opening three months of the year. US stocks are off to a positive starts, extending equity market gains across Asia and Europe. S&amp;P 500: up 0.49% Nasdaq: up 0.74% Dow: up 0.4% HSBC has ended up in hot water over the Hong Kong protests. The UK bank has reportedly been forced to close branches and suspend some ATMs across the region, after being targeted for shutting an account used to raise funds for demonstrators. The FT (\u00a3) reports: Ten of its branches were shut after undercover police carried out violent arrests of protesters who had turned their ire on HSBC following accusations it helped the police close an account held by Spark Alliance fund, a crowdsourcing operation. The attacks on HSBC extended to the iconic bronze lions outside the bank\u2019s Queen\u2019s Road Central headquarters, which still bear bullet marks from fighting during the second world war when the territory fell to Japan in 1941. Their eyes were smeared with red paint, their crevices stuffed with pamphlets and one was lit on fire on Wednesday night. The bank has tried to stay neutral throughout the unrest, though in August took out a full-page advertisement in local newspapers calling for a peaceful resolution to the standoff. The pound has extended its fall and is now down 0.6% at $1.317 against the US dollar. Versus the euro, sterling is down 0.36% at 1.177. Data from the US shows weekly jobless claims fell to 222,000 for the week of 28 December, down from from 224,000 a week earlier. That is lower than consensus estimates for 225,000. Growing numbers of business leaders in the UK believe Brexit uncertainty will take longer to resolve than Boris Johnson pledged before the election, according to a Bank of England survey. In a reflection of the challenges the government faces in striking a trade deal with the EU before the end of the year, Threadneedle Street said the date at which firms expected the issue to be clarified had been pushed further into the future. According to the central bank\u2019s decision maker panel, which surveys almost 3,000 chief financial officers from small, medium and large UK firms, as many as 42% said they thought the lack of clarity over Brexit their business face would not lift until at least 2021, up from 34% in November. The findings come as factory output across the UK plunged in December at the fastest rate in almost seven-and-a-half years, according to a separate survey. Both Brexit uncertainty and a wider manufacturing downturn around the world weighed on businesses. Read the full story here: European banking stocks rose to their highest level since May 2019 earlier in the session, when the Stoxx 600 Banking Index rose 2.2%. Gains have eased slightly, but the index is still up 1.8%. It is a bit of a relief rally, as investors are expecting capital requirements - how much banks need to set aside to offset risky assets and create a cushion for a downturn \u2013 to stabilise after years of increases, Bloomberg (\u00a3) reports. Bloomberg reports: After the 2008 financial crisis, regulators around the world forced banks to hold more capital to absorb losses without having to ask taxpayers for a bailout. That made banks stronger, but it also hurt investors because the lenders retained more profit to strengthen their reserves rather than rewarding shareholders. Now, banks including UniCredit say they\u2019re in a position to increase dividends and buy back shares. While others are struggling to increase profit in the face of negative interest rates and international trade disputes, their financial strength is also improving and they may follow the Italian lender. Greggs is riding the Veganuary wave, which has sent shares up 1.9% and put it among the top 25 stocks on the FTSE 250. Today marks the launch of Gregg\u2019s vegan steak bake, which hit shelves just in time for Veganuary \u2013 a growing movement that encourages people to embrace plant-based diets during January. Fans reportedly queued up for the meat-free version of its popular steak bake behind velvet ropes in Newcastle, where two night club-style bouncers were on duty and a DJ was spinning tracks inside. The first 200 customers even got to enjoy their steak bake in limited edition packaging and displays reminiscent of the high-profile iPhone launches. It comes a year after the launch of Greggs meatless sausage role, which is reponsible for fuelling an 80% jump in its share price in 2019. Costing from \u00a31.55, the bake is made from fungi-based protein Quorn instead of beef, mixed with diced onions and meat-free gravy. It has gone on sale in 1,300 shops today, and will be rolled out to the remaining 700 outlets on 16 January. KFC has also launched its vegan chicken burger nationwide today. You can read more about the hyped steak bake here: The FTSE 100 has nearly doubled its gains since the market open and is now trading higher by 0.98%. Gains are being led by Pearson and miners Glencore and Antofagasta, as well as Barclays which is up 3%. The pound has lost further ground against the US dollar, falling -0.4%. It is also down -0.2% against the euro. The decline has been chalked up to Brexit jitters ahead of the end-January Brexit date, and profit-taking on the bounce in sterling last month. While relations between Washington and Beijing have improved (at least enough to solidify phase one of a US-China trade deal), China seems to be cooling on Britain. Reuters reports that China has temporarily blocked a planned cross-border listing between the Shanghai and London stock exchanges due to political tensions with the UK. They centre around Britain\u2019s stance over the Hong Kong protests. Reuters reports: Suspending the Shanghai-London Stock Connect scheme casts a shadow over the future of a project meant to build ties between Britain and China, help Chinese firms expand their investor base and give mainland investors access to UK-listed companies. The sources, who include public officials and people working on potential Shanghai-London deals, all said that politics was behind the suspension. Two of them highlighted Britain\u2019s stance over the Hong Kong protests and one pointed to remarks over the detention of a now former staff member at its consulate in Hong Kong. A reminder that the M&amp;G property fund was suspended in early December following \u201cunusually high and sustained outflows\u201d \u2013 namely, investors demanding their money back \u2013 due to Brexit-related political uncertainty and the retail downturn that\u2019s been hitting Britain\u2019s high streets. It\u2019s not clear which other properties are on the chopping block as M&amp;G tries to raise enough cash to re-open the fund. But my colleague Julia Kollewe rounded up the top holdings following the suspension last month: More on the continued suspension of M&amp;G\u2019s \u00a32.5bn UK property fund. The investment firm said the decision to keep the fund gated was taken \u201cin the interest of protecting the fund\u2019s investor,\u201d and assured they were working hard to boost its cash position. Since the end of November the fund has sold around \u00a370.4m worth of assets and M&amp;G said it is poised to raise another \u00a367.2m. They\u2019ve ended up having to sell the Ravenside Retail Park in Edmonton, which hosts retailers including Mothercare, Carpetright, Wickes, and Argos, for \u00a351.4m. M&amp;G has also exchanged contracts on a property at 20 Kingston Road in Staines for \u00a319m. The M&amp;G statement said: The immediate priority is to raise cash levels in a controlled manner. The fund managers and associated teams are working hard to increase the fund\u2019s cash position and since the end of November, they have exchanged or completed on \u00a370.4m of assets and a further \u00a367.2m is either under offer or in solicitors\u2019 hands. Once cash levels have been sufficiently restored, the fund\u2019s ACD [authorised corporate director] will re-open the Fund for dealing. Naturally, the fund is still being actively managed and M&amp;G is regularly communicating with clients, customers and other stakeholders. City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority been notified of the continued suspension. M&amp;G Investments has confirmed it will keep its UK property fund and feeder fund gated until further notice, meaning investor cash is still trapped. The firm is required to update investors every 28 days about the state of the fund. UK factory output has contracted at the fastest pace since July 2012. It has now been below the neutral mark of 50 for eight months straight. But given the poor factory reading from the Eurozone, some analysts are pointing out that the UK performed relatively better: Buckle up for more PMI data. The final reading for UK manufacturing PMI for December came in at 47.5. That is slightly higher than the flash estimate of 47.4 but below November\u2019s reading of 49.1. It is also the second weakest level for nearly seven and a half years, having hit 47.4 in August this year. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit commenting on the latest eurozone PMI reading, says it will be a challenge to keep the eurozone economy out of recession in light of such a deep manufacturing contraction. Williamson said: Eurozone manufacturers reported a dire end to 2019, with output falling at a rate not exceeded since 2012. The survey is indicative of production falling by 1.5% in the fourth quarter, acting as a severe drag on the wider economy. Although firms grew somewhat more optimistic about the year ahead, a return to growth remains a long way off given that new order inflows continued to fall at one of the fastest rates seen over the past seven years. Firms sought to reduce inventory levels and cut headcounts as a result, focusing on slashing capacity and lowering costs. Such cost cutting was again also evident in further steep falls in demand for machinery, equipment and production-line inputs. Only households provided any source of improved demand in December, underscoring how the consumer sector has helped keep the economy out of recession in recent months. The ability of the wider economy to avoid sliding into a downturn in the face of such a steep manufacturing contraction remains a key challenge for the eurozone as we head into 2020. IHS Markit explained that both production and new orders continued to deteriorate in December, with output falling for an eleventh successive month and at a rate that matched September\u2019s 81-month record. The PMI report said: There was a broad-based softening of PMI figures during December, with seven of the eight countries covered by the survey recording weaker PMI numbers compared to November (the exception being Austria, which registered an unmoved reading). Germany was again the weakest-performing country, whilst the deteriorations seen in Italy and the Netherlands were the sharpest in over six-and-a-half years. Conversely, growth was sustained to a solid degree in Greece, whilst a marginal gain was seen in France. Manufacturing PMI data for the 19 Eurozone economies is in and the figures are not pretty. IHS Markit\u2019s Final manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index came in at 46.3 in December. That is higher than flash estimates of 45.9 but is still below November\u2019s reading of 46.9. It means manufacturing PMI has now been contracting for 11 straight months, having been below the 50 mark - which is the baseline for sector expansion \u2013 since February. Eurozone manufacturing PMIs are expected in less than five minutes time, but there are poor readings already coming out of individual countries including France, Germany and Italy. Howard Archer, economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club has details on the data: The pound\u2019s decline is helping prop up the UK\u2019s blue chip stocks this morning, as foreign earnings are worth more to multinational UK firms when sterling is weaker. The UK currency is suffering as we edge closer to Brexit, set for the end of January. Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at SpreadEx, says: The FTSE, which struck 7650 towards the end of last year before tumbling at its close, added 0.8%, lifting back to 7600 in the process. The index was helped by sterling\u2019s 0.3% decline against the dollar and euro alike, the currency feeling the pressure now that we are less than one month away from leaving the EU. The pound will be hoping for a better than forecast UK manufacturing PMI to act as a bit of reassurance. Mining giants Glencore and Antofagasta are among the top movers on the FTSE 100, up 2.5% and 2.2% respectively. Education publisher Pearson is ticking higher alongside, up 2.3%. But positive sentiment has swept across London\u2019s blue chip index, leaving just seven stocks in the red, though the declines are relatively muted: none are trading lower than -1%. European stocks have jumped at the start of their first trading day of 2020: FTSE 100: up 0.58% French Cac 40: 0.6% Spain\u2019s IBEX: up 0.8% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: up 0.5% Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600: 0.3% The German Dax is the only major index currently bucking the trend, trading lower by around 0.1%. Excitement about the US-China trade could be short-lived, with the devil likely to be the details of the Phase Two agreement. David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: President Trump said that phase one of the trade deal will be signed on 15 January, and even though a lot of the good news has already been factored in, it should assist with the bullish mood. Once the phase one hurdle has been cleared, traders will start to think about phase two. The second-leg of the trade deal will address trickier topics like intellectual property rights. Seeing as the first stage of the trade dispute dragged on for approximately 18 months, the next leg could last even longer \u2013 seeing as it is likely to be much complex. Mr Trump needs to show that he is standing up for American interests, but Beijing can play the long game, so the Chinese government have no incentive to meet all his demands. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Chinese stocks have led the charge in Asia, helped by news that the central bank will cut lenders\u2019 reserve ratio requirement, freeing up around 800bn yuan (\u00a387bn) in new funds for loans. It\u2019s hoped that the extra liquidity will prevent growth slowing in 2020. China\u2019s CSI 300: up 1.36% Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng: up 1.18% Shanghai\u2019s SSE Composite: up 1.15% The ratio requirement cut helped offset disappointment from the China\u2019s Caixin manufacturing PMI, which came in at 51.5 overnight. While it held above 50, the baseline for expansion, it was below economist expectations for 51.8. Reaction to the PMI data may have been worse were it not for the Phase One trade deal having been secured between the US and China. The deal will be signed by Washington and Beijing officials 15 January, but once that hurdle is cleared, jitters about Phase Two could revive uncertainty fears for markets. Commenting on the PMI data, analysts from Pantheon Macroeconomics said: The index was well above its uptrend, so a decline is not surprising. Without the Phase One trade deal it would have been worse. We are reticent to read too much into the details, but the loss of momentum in new orders is disappointing, chiming with the official report. Export orders appear to have been aided by the deal prospects, falling by less than the overall orders gauge, though the subindex remained only slightly above 50. We are also waiting for final manufacturing PMI readings for December, covering the eurozone and UK economies. Stay tuned!

And the senior civil servant who writes anonymously for the Guardian has already warned of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/16/whitehall-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-civil-servants\">tough love in store </a>as Cummings gets his public sector reform plans under way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/16/whitehall-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-civil-servants\">Watch out, Whitehall. Dominic Cummings has some tough love in store for us | The civil servant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019re told Cummings has spent two decades hatching plans to replace \u201clazy\u201d civil servants with \u201ccompetent and expert\u201d staff. It\u2019s the stuff to make Dave Penman, the secretary general of the FDA union for senior civil servants, apoplectic. Penman is certainly going to have a busy year defending his members from the onslaught.</p> <p>Spending a long time on preparation for government guarantees nothing. Former health secretary Andrew Lansley was lauded for coming into the 2010 coalition government with his plans for reforming the NHS carefully mapped out. The result? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/sep/23/andrew-lansley-fails-recognise-nhs-reforms-dont-work\">Huge disruption and enduring difficulties</a>. And then a year ago, Lansley\u2019s basic premise \u2013 that greater competition would make the NHS better \u2013 was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46827981\">effectively reversed</a> in the NHS long term plan, which argues collaboration is key.</p> <p>Coming in with zeal and a plan to reform is nothing new. Cummings and Wolf are keen to improve public service delivery \u2013 but that\u2019s not new, either. Over the years, practically every prime minister and many, manywithin the civil service itself have recognised its limitations: too much staff movement, too little emphasis on delivery, too much detachment from the people who use public services. The present chief executive of the civil service, Sir John Manzoni, has put a lot of effort into improving delivery and project skills.

And while the Prospect union has<a href=\"https://prospect.org.uk/news/civil-service-reform-debate-must-be-genuine-and-include-staff/\"> cautiously welcomed</a> some aspects of the proposed shake-up, it is concerned about changes being run by \u201cdiktat from the centre\u201d.</p> <p>As the Institute for Government thinktank <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/news/in-the-press/mhclg-churn-damaging-institutional-memory\">keeps pointing out</a>, it would help if ministers stayed longer - the most reform was achieved under Francis Maude, Cabinet Office minister for five years from 2010 onwards, who stuck it out and really cared.

      "bodyText": "Sabre-rattling worthy of Lord Palmerston is well and truly under way this new year, with civil servants being warned they are \u201cwoefully unprepared\u201d for the true scale of change about to descend on public services. Boris Johnson adviser Rachel Wolf says the prime minister can\u2019t deliver his election manifesto promises, which she helped write, without changing how government operates. \u201cDowning Street wants to run the most dynamic state in the world,\u201d she writes. \u201cOne that gathers the brightest minds to deliver in new agencies focused on innovation, solving the productivity puzzle, and transforming swathes of the country.\u201d To do this, delivery and the \u201ccapacity for transformation\u201d need to change. How? By making civil servants pass exams, perhaps, or stay in jobs longer than 18 months, and by increasing skills in key areas including data science, systems thinking and something called \u201csuper-forecasting\u201d. While many may not be sure what exactly the latter skill is, or who possesses it, or what good it will do, the message is clear: a civil service in which people are overpromoted to levels of incompetence must shape up. Many experts see 2020 as a make or break year for the civil service. Before Christmas, consultant Andrew Greenaway wrote that much of what No 10 special adviser Dominic Cummings has written about data, teams, communications and openness reflects existing best practice, adding that Cummings is \u201cwithin his rights to complain that far too much of the bureaucracy has failed to adopt similar ways of working\u201d. And the senior civil servant who writes anonymously for the Guardian has already warned of the tough love in store as Cummings gets his public sector reform plans under way. We\u2019re told Cummings has spent two decades hatching plans to replace \u201clazy\u201d civil servants with \u201ccompetent and expert\u201d staff. It\u2019s the stuff to make Dave Penman, the secretary general of the FDA union for senior civil servants, apoplectic. Penman is certainly going to have a busy year defending his members from the onslaught. Spending a long time on preparation for government guarantees nothing. Former health secretary Andrew Lansley was lauded for coming into the 2010 coalition government with his plans for reforming the NHS carefully mapped out. The result? Huge disruption and enduring difficulties. And then a year ago, Lansley\u2019s basic premise \u2013 that greater competition would make the NHS better \u2013 was effectively reversed in the NHS long term plan, which argues collaboration is key. Coming in with zeal and a plan to reform is nothing new. Cummings and Wolf are keen to improve public service delivery \u2013 but that\u2019s not new, either. Over the years, practically every prime minister and many, manywithin the civil service itself have recognised its limitations: too much staff movement, too little emphasis on delivery, too much detachment from the people who use public services. The present chief executive of the civil service, Sir John Manzoni, has put a lot of effort into improving delivery and project skills. Getting bogged down in civil service promotion incentives is likely to prove more of a distraction than a help. And while the Prospect union has cautiously welcomed some aspects of the proposed shake-up, it is concerned about changes being run by \u201cdiktat from the centre\u201d. As the Institute for Government thinktank keeps pointing out, it would help if ministers stayed longer - the most reform was achieved under Francis Maude, Cabinet Office minister for five years from 2010 onwards, who stuck it out and really cared. And even then, many of Maude\u2019s reforms have come unstuck, including a hated performance management scheme, dubbed \u201crank and yank\u201d, that he imposed on the civil service. But the real issue for this government is the complexity of public service structure. Delivering more bus services, for instance, which is one of the government\u2019s aims, requires a detailed understanding of how local public services work and how they have been impacted by austerity. Putting civil servants in front of focus groups to make them get closer to the people they serve is a good idea, but it\u2019s salutary to remember that many local NHS and council services directly in touch with users have failed to deliver. To take just one example: the scathing report on children\u2019s services at West Sussex county council, which pointed out \u201ca particular disconnect between some of the survey information, gathered internally about the effectiveness of services, and the actual performance of children\u2019s services\u201d. The questions public service managers will be asking aren\u2019t about civil service reform, but whether austerity really is over \u2013 and if so, where will the money flow as the tap turns back on for public services? There are, as yet, no clear answers. There\u2019ll be more detail when the chancellor finally presents his budget in February, once the UK has left the EU. In the meantime, the government\u2019s piecemeal announcements on public spending since the Queen\u2019s speech on 19 December won\u2019t have anyone celebrating. Public services are on their knees. But there\u2019s no sign that the government has a vision of how they could be put back on their feet, let alone improved. Rearranging the civil service isn\u2019t going to help social care.",

Sebastian Kurz, the leader of the Austrian People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP), is set to return to the chancellorship, after hammering out a deal with Werner Kogler of the Greens, which would bring the smaller party into the national government for the first time. Unveiling the agreement on Thursday, Kurz said it was \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d and allowed the two parties to keep their election promises. Under the plans, Austria will aim to become carbon neutral by 2040, a decade earlier than an EU-wide target. Kurz said Austria would be a forerunner in protecting the climate, with a pledge for all electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030, as well as more spending on public transport. Kogler, nominated as vice chancellor, said the agreement would make flying slightly more expensive and taking the train cheaper. The two leaders reached agreement over the weekend after weeks of negotiations following September\u2019s elections. Both parties made gains in the national vote, called after the breakup of Kurz\u2019s coalition with the far-right Freedom party over a corruption scandal. Kurz\u2019s party will have 10 ministers in the new government, including those responsible for foreign policy, defence, finance and home affairs. The Green party will hold four portfolios: environment, justice, social affairs, sports and culture. Ahead of the official announcement on Thursday afternoon, Austrian media concluded that Kurz had succeeded in pushing forward his tough stance on illegal immigration and \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d in the 300-page coalition deal. \u201cA lot of turquoise and a little green,\u201d was the headline in the tabloid Kronen Zeitung, referring to the political colours of the two parties, concluding that Kurz\u2019s agenda had prevailed, while a big reform of green taxes would have to wait. The paper reported that the coalition deal includes banning the headscarf in schools for girls up to age 14, an extension of the garment ban that applies until age 10 approved by lawmakers earlier this year. The agreement also revives a plan for \u201cprecautionary detention\u201d of potentially dangerous asylum seekers even if those individuals have not committed a crime. Earlier this year the Kurz government proposed detaining asylum seekers deemed to pose a risk to the public without a court order, a plan that would require a constitutional amendment. The government also plans new return centres for asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected. The two parties have also agreed to set up a working group on a greener tax system. According to Die Presse newspaper, CO2 will be taxed more heavily, but there will be no explicit carbon tax.

Other Green policies contained in the coalition deal include plans for a freedom of information law and greater oversight of party finances. Kurz also announced that corporation tax will be cut to 21% from 25%. Income taxes will also be reduced for those for those in the current 25%, 35% and 42% brackets, with corresponding rates cut to 20%, 30% and 40%. If the Greens\u2019 federal council approves the coalition agreement, the government is expected to take office on 7 January. Observers do not expect this body of local and national lawmakers to block their party\u2019s path to power, but Kurz\u2019s hardline stance on immigration and identity will be difficult to swallow.

Kurz\u2019s confidante, Susanne Raab, who worked on the country\u2019s 2017 ban on full-face veils and a 2015 law designed to curb \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d, is expected to run a new ministry for integration.

      "bodyText": "\u201cParadise found\u201d, reads a sign at one of Spain\u2019s more exclusive, and unlikely, beach bars. Another touts pi\u00f1a coladas, mojitos and caipirinhas while an adjacent notice reminds guests that shirts must be worn. On a cold, clear December afternoon, however, the artificial beach on the Isla de Valdeca\u00f1as is deserted, the bar shuttered and the dog days of the year a distant memory. The question for those who work or own property on the island, which sits in a huge reservoir in the south-western Spanish region of Extremadura, is how many more summers the development will see. Twelve years after work began to turn the 130-hectare (321-acre) site into a sprawling residential, tourism and leisure complex, the project is facing demolition. Supporters of the development, who include the regional government and many residents of nearby villages \u2013 not to mention the well-heeled madrile\u00f1os who have bought boltholes in the oasis less than two hours\u2019 drive from the capital \u2013 argue that it would be folly to tear down the four-star hotel, sprawling golf course and villas. But ecologists who have been fighting the project through the courts since 2007 say the resort should never have been built on the island, which sits in a special bird protection zone and forms part of an EU-wide conservation area. In a 2011 ruling later upheld by the supreme court, the regional high court ordered the island be returned to its previous state on the basis that its designation as a \u201cproject of regional interest\u201d was invalid. In November, the country\u2019s constitutional court headed off another challenge by the Extremaduran regional government and the matter is once again before the regional high court, which will decide how to effect its 2011 ruling. For the time being, however, the island floats in a familiar limbo. A second hotel by the beach remains a half-built jumble of concrete and steel, and the rows of villas are shut up for winter, their drives covered with fallen leaves. Aside from the three men playing golf on the immaculate course and a rabbit that hops across the road with a spectacular lack of urgency, there are few signs of life. The Association for the Defence of Extremadura\u2019s Nature and Resources (Adenex), which brought the legal challenge, says the court\u2019s rulings need to be carried out to respect the law and to restore and protect biodiversity. \u201cSpain is still a democratic country and it\u2019s the job of social and ecological movements to be transparent and consistent when it comes to defending the law and the European network of protected spaces,\u201d it argues. The regional government, or junta \u2013 which has put the cost of demolishing the development and compensating property owners at \u20ac130m (\u00a3111m) \u2013 says restoring the island to its former state makes little sense. \u201cIt was just a space planted with eucalyptus trees with no environmental value worth preserving,\u201d according to a spokeswoman. The junta also points out that Extremadura, one of Spain\u2019s most neglected regions, is facing depopulation and needs to be able to offer jobs such as those provided by the development. \u201cAs far as this administration is concerned, creating economic activity and employment to avoid depopulation is in the common interest and is something that is and can be compatible with sustainability.\u201d It hopes an agreement can be reached to preserve the finished areas, knock down the half-built ones and make the project more environmentally sustainable. Some of those who live nearby claim the development\u2019s critics forget that the site used to be a dumping ground littered with cans, glass, plastic and old domestic appliances. \u201cThis has been going on for 12 years and people are pretty fed up with the environmental sector,\u201d says Silvia Sarro, the mayor of the nearby village of El Gordo. \u201cPeople talk about this island like it was a wilderness before but it wasn\u2019t \u2013 it was a dump.\u201d Sarro says the development provides service and maintenance jobs for people in El Gordo and elsewhere in the area and should be left as it is. \u201cPeople talk about the \u2018empty Spain\u2019 and it\u2019s something we all feel and something we\u2019re living through across the whole region,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done on the island has meant that families have been able to stay in the area. There have even been some new people moving in \u2013 because of the complex.\u201d Adenex disagrees, saying it would have been better to spend all the capital invested in the project on a legal and sustainable enterprise to bring in tourists and support the people of El Gordo and the nearby, smaller village of Berrocalejo. Some, however, remain unconvinced by those arguments. Juan Carlos Dom\u00ednguez, who runs a small gardening business and has worked in the complex for more than a decade, has little nostalgia for the island of 15 years ago. \u201cPeople used to dump their washing machines there once they\u2019d stopped working,\u201d he says, adding that demolition would ruin him. \u201cIt makes up about 80% of my company\u2019s work,\u201d he says. \u201cI started the business to work on the island.

Ginger and Fred (1986)<br></h2> <p>This reunited two of Fellini\u2019s great collaborators: his wife and great love Giulietta Masina and Marcello Mastroianni playing two cheesy old hoofers who do a Fred\u2019n\u2019Ginger tribute routine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8d371cc0cb94a6a957d67b1b7bab291b66f373f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8d371cc0cb94a6a957d67b1b7bab291b66f373f/178_389_4846_2908/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcello Mastroianni and Giulietta Masina in Ginger and Fred\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcello Mastroianni and Giulietta Masina in Ginger and Fred.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stella/Bibo Tv/Anthea/PEA/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>18. Intervista (1987)<br></h2> <p>A fantasy-fictional version of a documentary, as Fellini grants an interview to a Japanese camera crew and takes them round Cinecitt\u00e0 studios and the contents of his own mind and memories.</p> <h2>17. City of Women (1980)<br></h2> <p>Some quaint softcore sensuality, perhaps, in this study of a man (Mastroianni) who, Dante-like, wakes up in the middle of his life and finds himself in a hotel in the middle of the woods that is overrun with desirable women.</p> <h2>16. Fellini Satyricon (1969)<br></h2> <p>A movie with Fellini\u2019s signature surrealism and episodic structure: a fever dream of imperial Rome, taken from Petronius.</p> <h2>15. Variety Lights (1950)<br></h2> <p>Fellini\u2019s debut movie, co-directed with Albert Lattuada, and with a real taste of the exuberance and theatricality still to come. A beautiful young woman joins a travelling troupe of entertainers. Masina has a tiny role as the girlfriend of one of the vaudevillians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a9d4c0a3021efca29c379e5dfd1750ceb9f92543\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9d4c0a3021efca29c379e5dfd1750ceb9f92543/0_348_3792_2275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peppino Da Filippo and Giulietta Masina in Variety Lights\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peppino Da Filippo and Giulietta Masina in Fellini\u2019s first feature film, Variety Lights.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Capitolium/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>14. Fellini\u2019s Casanova (1976)<br></h2> <p>Donald Sutherland is Casanova who, in keeping with Fellini\u2019s habitual wayward episodic anarchy and surrealism, is shown not really as a great lover, but an absurd and comic figure at the mercy of fate and his urges.</p> <h2>13. Orchestra Rehearsal (1978)<br></h2> <p>An interesting, atypical, underrated Fellini film \u2013 perhaps closer to Milo\u0161 Forman \u2013 a political satire about an orchestra that goes on strike.</p> <h2>12. The Clowns (1970)<br></h2> <p>A docu-fiction about Fellini\u2019s fascination and passion for circus clowns. It features \u2013 as a dwarf nun \u2013 Adelina Poerio, who went on to play the red-clad killer in Don\u2019t Look Now.</p> <h2>11. The White Sheik (1952)<br></h2> <p>This was Fellini\u2019s first solo directing credit: a joyful romantic comedy that stars the veteran Roman actor Alberto Sordi as a bridegroom whose wife goes missing. It was remade by Woody Allen as one of the sections in his 2012 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/16/to-rome-with-love-review\" title=\"\">To Rome With Love</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d93c6a8ff0d7bc1b4c1a9aded3bf771572214981\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d93c6a8ff0d7bc1b4c1a9aded3bf771572214981/0_164_3088_2206/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alberto Sordi and Brunella Bovo in The White Sheik\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alberto Sordi and Brunella Bovo in The White Sheik.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PDC/OFI/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10. Il Bidone (1955)<br></h2> <p>This film , like La Strada, is a midway point between the neorealism of Fellini\u2019s early screenwriting career and the humour and picaresque pathos of his later work. Broderick Crawford, Richard Basehart and Masina star in a story about a team of confidence tricksters roaming the countryside tricking farmers out of their savings. Crawford plays Augusto, the leader of the gang, who is coming to tire of this life. His personal confusion is brought to a crisis when his daughter re-enters his life.</p> <h2>9. Roma (1972)<br></h2> <p>An intensely personal, exuberant and extravagant film that is at once a fantastical autobiography and a kind of episodic, biographical portrait of the film\u2019s leading character: Rome itself, which is presented in a series of semi-connected episodes of its past and present. Roma is also notable for featuring a swansong appearance for the legendary Roman star Anna Magnani. As so often, the movie transforms material that would otherwise be merely autobiographical: a heightened, hallucinatory version of Fellini takes us on a journey into the city, beginning with a spectacular shot of a traffic jam.</p> <h2>8. Juliet of the Spirits (1965)<br></h2> <p>This was Fellini\u2019s first full-length colour film, and it is a classic of fantasy, theatricality and sensuality. Masina stars as Juliet, an unhappily married woman with a philandering husband, who conceives a preoccupation with the life of her super-sexy and buxom neighbour Suzy, played by the actor Sandra Milo (who played the director\u2019s mistress in 8 \u00bd). Suzy seems to live a guilt- and risk-free life of sexual pleasure in a house tricked out for gratification, and she appears to be inviting Juliet to join her in this attitude. A complex, unhappy film, said to be inspired by a difficult patch in Masina\u2019s relationship with Fellini.</p> <h2>7. And The Ship Sails On (1983)<br></h2> <p>Another surreal gem from Fellini: a movie whose love of its own artificiality is obvious. It\u2019s a hothouse flower of a film, created in the studio, not the streets \u2013 about as far from neorealism as you can get. A group of musical notables are on a cruise-ship journey to scatter the ashes of a famous opera singer \u2013 and Fellini serves up a chocolate box of bizarre and hilarious moments and scenes as these various conductors, soloists and sopranos bicker, intrigue and fall out. But the setting is July 1914, after the Archduke Franz Ferdinand assassination, with war on the horizon, and the tension is ratcheted up when a group of Serbian refugees are accepted on to the ship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"88ac315ecbfe8fa73632ac3e0f81ac1b4d1298b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88ac315ecbfe8fa73632ac3e0f81ac1b4d1298b8/0_44_2212_1327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene of fascists in Amarcord\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amarcord gathered Fellini\u2019s memories of the fascist Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6. Amarcord (1973)<br></h2> <p>Fellini\u2019s genius for welding memory, dream and waking consciousness is on show in this classic movie, whose title is a slang phrase for \u201cI remember\u201d. It\u2019s a personal, quasi-autobiographical tale of a little boy growing up near Rimini, the place of Fellini\u2019s own boyhood, in an Italy dominated by fascism and the Catholic church. As ever, the spirit and aesthetics of the circus are present: scenes and ideas and images will exuberantly follow each other for our delectation like circus acts being brought into the ring.</p> <h2>5. Nights of Cabiria (1957)<br></h2> <p>One of Fellini\u2019s truly great films, with a fierce note of melancholy and even tragedy that is perhaps atypical of him. Masina plays Cabiria, a sex worker whose paradoxical mixture of vulnerability and defiant strength is rendered in a series of episodes. She lives in a wretched shack on the outskirts of town: the eerie modernised wasteland that captured the imagination of both Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni. Cabiria leads an existence that is almost feral, but at any moment she could find herself in a rich man\u2019s apartment or on a squalid street, and she rises above it all.</p> <h2>4. I Vitelloni (1953)<br></h2> <p>Fellini\u2019s I Vitelloni (\u201cThe Young Bucks\u201d) is an explosion of energy, vitality and warmth: a crowd of restless young men (each with a dash of Fellini himself), led by the rising comedy star Alberto Sordi, dream of escaping their provincial hometown while remaining fiercely loyal to it. Quite a lot of the time, they do nothing and there is not much to do: they grow moustaches, then shave them off. They chase after women and then feel themselves being chased \u2013 evading the responsibilities of fatherhood \u2013 and, of course, there is the key Fellini carnival moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1866a80394236cee12b57f09824269d408af39e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1866a80394236cee12b57f09824269d408af39e3/0_36_2627_1576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giulietta Masina and Anthony Quinn in La Strada\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giulietta Masina and Anthony Quinn in La Strada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Allstar Colle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3. La Strada (1954)<br></h2> <p>The heart-wrenching operatic pathos of this early Fellini masterpiece will blow you away, no matter how many times you see it. Masini gives a Chaplinesque performance as the simple working-class girl, with what would now be called learning difficulties, who is sold by her family for 10,000 lire to a brutish travelling player called Zampan\u00f2, played by Anthony Quinn. He bullies and exploits her but realises too late that her presence in his life was the working of a mysterious divine grace. It is a rare moment in Fellini when he goes behind the scenes of circus theatricality and shows us that it is not simply a gorgeously surreal phenomenon, but a tough business that involves heartbreak for its practitioners.</p> <h2>2. La Dolce Vita (1960)<br></h2> <p>There is pure euphoria and inspiration in this magnificent film that satirises the fashionable world of Swinging Rome in the early 1960s. Fellini\u2019s cinema put Italy at the centre of the world in the way that the Beatles would put Britain there a few years later. Mastroianni is the jaded gossip journalist who hangs around the Via Veneto parasitically hoping for showbusiness stories and despising himself for not having written his novel yet. He falls briefly in love with a visiting American star, played by Anita Ekberg, the pair disporting themselves in the Trevi fountain, and submits to a beating from her enraged husband. Later, he will report on a sighting of the Virgin Mary by two children; the sacred and profane are of equal importance here.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmIC9pQ80Fk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RmIC9pQ80Fk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch a trailer for the restored version of 8 \u00bd</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>1. 8 \u00bd (1963)<br></h2> <p>Fellini\u2019s masterpiece starts with cinema\u2019s greatest and most disturbing dream sequence, all the more disquieting for being woven into a film in which dreams and fantasies are being manufactured as a way of escaping dreary reality. Mastroianni plays a film director, Guido Anselmi, who is evidently based on Fellini himself and clearly being created as a kind of therapeutic self-invention or self-mythologising. Guido has reached a moment of personal and creative crisis: he is blocked and production on his latest film has stalled. He embarks on a personal voyage into memory and the past, and a reckoning with all the women he has loved.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The BFI is <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/whats-on/bfi-film-releases/federico-fellini-touring-package\">celebrating Fellini\u2019s centenary</a> with a series of screenings in London and on tour from 3 January.</em></p>",

Fellini\u2019s Casanova (1976) Donald Sutherland is Casanova who, in keeping with Fellini\u2019s habitual wayward episodic anarchy and surrealism, is shown not really as a great lover, but an absurd and comic figure at the mercy of fate and his urges. 13. Orchestra Rehearsal (1978) An interesting, atypical, underrated Fellini film \u2013 perhaps closer to Milo\u0161 Forman \u2013 a political satire about an orchestra that goes on strike. 12. The Clowns (1970) A docu-fiction about Fellini\u2019s fascination and passion for circus clowns. It features \u2013 as a dwarf nun \u2013 Adelina Poerio, who went on to play the red-clad killer in Don\u2019t Look Now. 11. The White Sheik (1952) This was Fellini\u2019s first solo directing credit: a joyful romantic comedy that stars the veteran Roman actor Alberto Sordi as a bridegroom whose wife goes missing. It was remade by Woody Allen as one of the sections in his 2012 film To Rome With Love. 10. Il Bidone (1955) This film , like La Strada, is a midway point between the neorealism of Fellini\u2019s early screenwriting career and the humour and picaresque pathos of his later work. Broderick Crawford, Richard Basehart and Masina star in a story about a team of confidence tricksters roaming the countryside tricking farmers out of their savings. Crawford plays Augusto, the leader of the gang, who is coming to tire of this life. His personal confusion is brought to a crisis when his daughter re-enters his life. 9. Roma (1972) An intensely personal, exuberant and extravagant film that is at once a fantastical autobiography and a kind of episodic, biographical portrait of the film\u2019s leading character: Rome itself, which is presented in a series of semi-connected episodes of its past and present. Roma is also notable for featuring a swansong appearance for the legendary Roman star Anna Magnani. As so often, the movie transforms material that would otherwise be merely autobiographical: a heightened, hallucinatory version of Fellini takes us on a journey into the city, beginning with a spectacular shot of a traffic jam. 8. Juliet of the Spirits (1965) This was Fellini\u2019s first full-length colour film, and it is a classic of fantasy, theatricality and sensuality. Masina stars as Juliet, an unhappily married woman with a philandering husband, who conceives a preoccupation with the life of her super-sexy and buxom neighbour Suzy, played by the actor Sandra Milo (who played the director\u2019s mistress in 8 \u00bd). Suzy seems to live a guilt- and risk-free life of sexual pleasure in a house tricked out for gratification, and she appears to be inviting Juliet to join her in this attitude. A complex, unhappy film, said to be inspired by a difficult patch in Masina\u2019s relationship with Fellini. 7. And The Ship Sails On (1983) Another surreal gem from Fellini: a movie whose love of its own artificiality is obvious. It\u2019s a hothouse flower of a film, created in the studio, not the streets \u2013 about as far from neorealism as you can get. A group of musical notables are on a cruise-ship journey to scatter the ashes of a famous opera singer \u2013 and Fellini serves up a chocolate box of bizarre and hilarious moments and scenes as these various conductors, soloists and sopranos bicker, intrigue and fall out. But the setting is July 1914, after the Archduke Franz Ferdinand assassination, with war on the horizon, and the tension is ratcheted up when a group of Serbian refugees are accepted on to the ship. 6. Amarcord (1973) Fellini\u2019s genius for welding memory, dream and waking consciousness is on show in this classic movie, whose title is a slang phrase for \u201cI remember\u201d. It\u2019s a personal, quasi-autobiographical tale of a little boy growing up near Rimini, the place of Fellini\u2019s own boyhood, in an Italy dominated by fascism and the Catholic church. As ever, the spirit and aesthetics of the circus are present: scenes and ideas and images will exuberantly follow each other for our delectation like circus acts being brought into the ring. 5. Nights of Cabiria (1957) One of Fellini\u2019s truly great films, with a fierce note of melancholy and even tragedy that is perhaps atypical of him. Masina plays Cabiria, a sex worker whose paradoxical mixture of vulnerability and defiant strength is rendered in a series of episodes. She lives in a wretched shack on the outskirts of town: the eerie modernised wasteland that captured the imagination of both Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni. Cabiria leads an existence that is almost feral, but at any moment she could find herself in a rich man\u2019s apartment or on a squalid street, and she rises above it all. 4. I Vitelloni (1953) Fellini\u2019s I Vitelloni (\u201cThe Young Bucks\u201d) is an explosion of energy, vitality and warmth: a crowd of restless young men (each with a dash of Fellini himself), led by the rising comedy star Alberto Sordi, dream of escaping their provincial hometown while remaining fiercely loyal to it. Quite a lot of the time, they do nothing and there is not much to do: they grow moustaches, then shave them off. They chase after women and then feel themselves being chased \u2013 evading the responsibilities of fatherhood \u2013 and, of course, there is the key Fellini carnival moment. 3. La Strada (1954) The heart-wrenching operatic pathos of this early Fellini masterpiece will blow you away, no matter how many times you see it. Masini gives a Chaplinesque performance as the simple working-class girl, with what would now be called learning difficulties, who is sold by her family for 10,000 lire to a brutish travelling player called Zampan\u00f2, played by Anthony Quinn. He bullies and exploits her but realises too late that her presence in his life was the working of a mysterious divine grace. It is a rare moment in Fellini when he goes behind the scenes of circus theatricality and shows us that it is not simply a gorgeously surreal phenomenon, but a tough business that involves heartbreak for its practitioners. 2. La Dolce Vita (1960) There is pure euphoria and inspiration in this magnificent film that satirises the fashionable world of Swinging Rome in the early 1960s. Fellini\u2019s cinema put Italy at the centre of the world in the way that the Beatles would put Britain there a few years later. Mastroianni is the jaded gossip journalist who hangs around the Via Veneto parasitically hoping for showbusiness stories and despising himself for not having written his novel yet. He falls briefly in love with a visiting American star, played by Anita Ekberg, the pair disporting themselves in the Trevi fountain, and submits to a beating from her enraged husband. Later, he will report on a sighting of the Virgin Mary by two children; the sacred and profane are of equal importance here. 1. 8 \u00bd (1963) Fellini\u2019s masterpiece starts with cinema\u2019s greatest and most disturbing dream sequence, all the more disquieting for being woven into a film in which dreams and fantasies are being manufactured as a way of escaping dreary reality. Mastroianni plays a film director, Guido Anselmi, who is evidently based on Fellini himself and clearly being created as a kind of therapeutic self-invention or self-mythologising. Guido has reached a moment of personal and creative crisis: he is blocked and production on his latest film has stalled. He embarks on a personal voyage into memory and the past, and a reckoning with all the women he has loved. \u2022 The BFI is celebrating Fellini\u2019s centenary with a series of screenings in London and on tour from 3 January.",

Still: there\u2019s no doubt his modest contributions and leadership behind the scenes are a big reason why the Bills are back in the playoffs for the second time in three seasons. (And all this after an 18-year drought, once the longest in North American pro sports.) On Saturday they\u2019ll pit their top-10 rushing attack against the Houston Texans\u2019 bottom-10 rush defense and play for a wild-card upset on the road.</p> <p>That Gore should feature prominently in these epic milestones \u2013 and not, say, former Chiefs dynamo Jamaal Charles or former Titans dazzler Chris Johnson or former St. Louis Ram bruiser Steven Jackson \u2013 beggars belief. Consider: this is a 36-year-old dude playing on his third team in five seasons, after spending the first decade of his career in San Francisco. By rights, Gore should be opening up a restaurant or settling into an analyst gig or home getting his college-bound son, Frank Gore Jr, ready for <a href=\"https://thespun.com/college-football/frank-gore-jr-son-recruit-flip-southern-miss-fau\">his own running back career</a> instead wintering in Buffalo in preparation for his first playoff appearance in six years.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, pro football isn\u2019t just a pass-first league now; it\u2019s a pass early and often league. The modern game claims to have no place for a bell-cow back with Gore\u2019s bona fides. And yet this dude abides. With each new handoff, he lowers his shoulders and steams ahead, face mask jutting out like a cowcatcher, yards piling up all the while. His silent protest of the NFL\u2019s pass wacky era alone should mark him as a gridiron wizard. Yet when a jury of football druids compiled a list of the NFL\u2019s best 100 players ever for the occasion of the league\u2019s centennial, Gore\u2019s name was <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/100/all-time-team/roster\">nowhere to be found</a> on a running back roster that included Brown, Payton, Sanders and Smith.</p> <p>On the one hand that figures. Gore has yet to win a Super Bowl, falling <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/baltimore-ravens/0ap2000000205652/Niners-final-drive-of-Super-Bowl-XLVII\">a goal line stand short</a> when the Colin Kaepernick-led San Francisco 49ers faced the Baltimore Ravens in 2013 despite rushing for a game-high 110 yards on 19 carries. Gore also has never finished better than third on the single-season rushing yardage list and isn\u2019t likely to improve in that area as opportunities diminish with age. Worst of all, his style is so unassuming. He\u2019s not much of a first-down celebrator or an end-zone dancer. Strip away the stakes, and the carry on which he pipped Sanders \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzO7cv-Gl_A\">a fourth-quarter burst</a> through the teeth of the Broncos line that went for seven yards \u2013 becomes about as exciting as the sight of Sanders calmly <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/td-tuesday/0ap3000000810695/Top-10-End-Zone-Celebrations-Barry-Sanders\">handing the ball off to an official</a> after one of his unreal touchdown scampers. Call him \u201cFrank Bore\u201d.</p> <p>On the other hand you\u2019d be hard pressed to name a modern tailback who\u2019s proven as durable as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frankgore/status/1131352169138065408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1131352169138065408&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsnaut.com%2F2019%2F05%2Flook-bills-rb-frank-gore-is-absolutely-ripped%2F\">Frank the Tank</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpZJKip15CY\">workout warrior</a> who has missed only two games since 2011. For any other pro tailback, this would be a remarkable achievement. In Gore\u2019s case, it should never have happened. After all, he grew up poor in Coconut Grove, Florida, sharing a two-bedroom house with nine other relatives \u2013 not least a mother <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2015/10/02/frank-gore-indianapolis-colts-san-francisco-49ers-miami-hurricanes/73181198/\">with a grave cocaine addiction</a>. He suffered from a crippling form of dyslexia that nearly kept him out of college. At the University of Miami he was buried on a depth chart that at points featured Clinton Portis, Willis McGahee and Najeh Davenport \u2013 future Sunday stars, all. When Gore finally reached the field, he tore the anterior cruciate ligaments in both his knees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"95aa3745a025e8bada030e3db3c167f8fa15d724\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95aa3745a025e8bada030e3db3c167f8fa15d724/0_0_4587_3058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Gore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Gore, 36, is playing on a third team in five seasons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Munson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following a successful rehab timed to the 2005 NFL draft, Gore saw his slim chance of turning pro narrow yet again after showing up overweight to the scouting combine and posting <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1130834-nfl-draft-2012-the-5-best-and-the-5-worst-wonderlic-scores-in-nfl-history%22%20%5Cl%20%22slide2\">a six out of 50</a> on the Wonderlic Test \u2013 a score 14 points below average and four points below the standard for literacy. That was enough for the handful of teams that had kicked the tires on Gore to consider other prospects. Only the 49ers didn\u2019t flinch, selecting Gore at the top of the third round. And he promptly repaid their loyalty by dedicating the next 10 seasons to becoming the best back in the history of that Tiffany franchise. Not even two bum shoulders that would require reconstructive surgery after his rookie season slowed him down.</p> <p>Gore was no less determined after leaving San Francisco to sign with Indianapolis, or after leaving Indy for Miami three years later. And though he continued to lead those teams in rushing even as his efficiency tapered, Gore failed in his quest to return to the heights he had reached in San Francisco. Last March he started over again in Buffalo, signing a one-year deal for $2m to share a backfield with fellow Pro Bowler LeSean McCoy. Five months later the Bills cut McCoy loose, leaving Gore to serve as a mentor to rookie running back Devin Singletary and second-year quarterback Josh Allen \u2013 a Gore jersey owner in his youth, as it happens. Together, they are the heart of the most rugged playoff offense outside of Nashville and the most exciting Bills offense since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ukq0W1ABJo4\">Flutiemania</a>. Which is to say: perhaps this right here is the signature Gore highlight we\u2019ve been waiting for.</p> <p>And while his particular strain of genius might not be so obvious, this much is clear: game recognizes game. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xzO7cv-Gl_A?t=24\">After the historic Denver game</a>, Gore was pressed by the Broncos fearsome pass rusher Von Miller for his game-worn jersey and, later, blitzed with video messages from Sanders, Smith and his son among other prominent well-wishers. To a man, they encouraged Gore to keep going \u2013 with McGahee pushing his Miami teammate not to stop until he reaches the top of the all-time rushing list. And, shoot, if Tom Brady can break records in his 40s, there\u2019s little reason to believe Gore can\u2019t as if he stays healthy and keeps having fun, and teams can still find use for him. The only question is whether he can do it in a Buffalo uniform.</p> <p>That said: it\u2019s not a question that the Bills\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_YdixWxgRY\">table-slamming faithful</a> figure to be asking this week, as they urge Gore on in hopes witnessing the team\u2019s first postseason victory since 1995. Another running back might shudder under that kind of pressure. But, clearly, Gore thrives under pressure. He just has a funny way of showing it.</p>",

At the University of Miami he was buried on a depth chart that at points featured Clinton Portis, Willis McGahee and Najeh Davenport \u2013 future Sunday stars, all. When Gore finally reached the field, he tore the anterior cruciate ligaments in both his knees. Following a successful rehab timed to the 2005 NFL draft, Gore saw his slim chance of turning pro narrow yet again after showing up overweight to the scouting combine and posting a six out of 50 on the Wonderlic Test \u2013 a score 14 points below average and four points below the standard for literacy. That was enough for the handful of teams that had kicked the tires on Gore to consider other prospects. Only the 49ers didn\u2019t flinch, selecting Gore at the top of the third round. And he promptly repaid their loyalty by dedicating the next 10 seasons to becoming the best back in the history of that Tiffany franchise. Not even two bum shoulders that would require reconstructive surgery after his rookie season slowed him down. Gore was no less determined after leaving San Francisco to sign with Indianapolis, or after leaving Indy for Miami three years later. And though he continued to lead those teams in rushing even as his efficiency tapered, Gore failed in his quest to return to the heights he had reached in San Francisco. Last March he started over again in Buffalo, signing a one-year deal for $2m to share a backfield with fellow Pro Bowler LeSean McCoy. Five months later the Bills cut McCoy loose, leaving Gore to serve as a mentor to rookie running back Devin Singletary and second-year quarterback Josh Allen \u2013 a Gore jersey owner in his youth, as it happens. Together, they are the heart of the most rugged playoff offense outside of Nashville and the most exciting Bills offense since Flutiemania. Which is to say: perhaps this right here is the signature Gore highlight we\u2019ve been waiting for. And while his particular strain of genius might not be so obvious, this much is clear: game recognizes game. After the historic Denver game, Gore was pressed by the Broncos fearsome pass rusher Von Miller for his game-worn jersey and, later, blitzed with video messages from Sanders, Smith and his son among other prominent well-wishers. To a man, they encouraged Gore to keep going \u2013 with McGahee pushing his Miami teammate not to stop until he reaches the top of the all-time rushing list. And, shoot, if Tom Brady can break records in his 40s, there\u2019s little reason to believe Gore can\u2019t as if he stays healthy and keeps having fun, and teams can still find use for him. The only question is whether he can do it in a Buffalo uniform. That said: it\u2019s not a question that the Bills\u2019 table-slamming faithful figure to be asking this week, as they urge Gore on in hopes witnessing the team\u2019s first postseason victory since 1995. Another running back might shudder under that kind of pressure. But, clearly, Gore thrives under pressure. He just has a funny way of showing it.",

      "bodyText": "Souvenir stands pitched in front of some of Rome\u2019s most prized monuments are to be moved in an attempt to improve the \u201cdecorum and security\u201d of the Italian capital\u2019s most famous tourist sites. The city\u2019s mayor, Virginia Raggi, said the stalls \u2013 selling an assortment of trinkets, including T-shirts, mugs, miniature Colosseums and figurines featuring everyone from Pope Francis to Donald Trump \u2013 are incongruous with their surroundings. Seventeen stalls will be moved from sites including the Trevi fountain, Spanish Steps, the Pantheon and Piazza Navona. However, eight of the 17 will still be able to trade on streets away from the monuments, Rome\u2019s authorities said in a notice. Raggi, who has long pledged to banish the stalls, said the move was intended to protect Rome\u2019s heritage while ensuring safety at its most-visited sites. She said last year that the stalls were sullying the city\u2019s image. The legislation was due to come into force on 1 January, but two stands were still in front of the Trevi Fountain on Thursday. Raggi also banned illegal street trading as part of a raft of rules announced last summer, but many still freely operate around the tourist sites. The mayor has been endeavouring to boost decorum in other ways, such as banning tourists from sitting on the Spanish Steps, eating \u201cmessy\u201d food by monuments, wandering around bare-chested and dragging suitcases and buggies down historic staircases. Steep fines are already in place for those who jump into the city\u2019s fountains. Many of the measures are difficult to enforce, but one that has been successful is a ban on modern-day centurions \u2013 men who dress up in tunics and leather breastplates, wielding plastic swords, to make money by posing for photographs.",

In a reflection of the challenges the government faces in striking a trade deal with the EU before the end of the year, Threadneedle Street said the date at which firms expected the issue to be clarified had been pushed further into the future. According to the central bank\u2019s decision maker panel, which surveys almost 3,000 chief financial officers from small, medium and large UK firms, as many as 42% said they thought the lack of clarity over Brexit that their business faced would not lift until at least 2021, up from 34% in November.

Sabaton may be an unfamiliar name to non-metalheads, but they won\u2019t be for long. Other than veterans Iron Maiden, they are the biggest heavy metal band in Europe. Their last album, <a href=\"https://www.sabaton.net/discography/the-great-war/\" title=\"\">The Great War</a>, reached No 1 in Sweden, Germany and Switzerland and No 11 in the UK \u2013 very respectable for a heavy metal band.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP8G-LwWNn0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xP8G-LwWNn0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the video for Fields of Verdun</figcaption> </figure>   <p>What\u2019s more, the band have made significant inroads into the notoriously Euro-phobic US rock market. In addition to their annual cruise (which has sold out every time), they have also been running their Sabaton Open Air festival in their home city of Falun, in central Sweden, since 2008, and have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaG4CBbZih6nLzD08bTBGfw\" title=\"\">their own history channel</a> on YouTube, where the stories behind their military history-themed songs are explored at length by academics and historians. Every diehard fan crammed into the ship\u2019s mini-theatre has completely bought into the whole thing. The response, as Sabaton conclude the show with pummelling metal jig Swedish Pagans, is deafening and utterly joyful.</p> <p>The following morning, swarms of brutally hungover fans stagger chaotically towards the ship\u2019s buffet restaurant for sustenance. Others stumble out on deck into sub-zero temperatures for a fag. Everyone seems to have survived the night without falling overboard. For all heavy metal\u2019s reputation for rowdiness, the Sabaton cruise has a lovely family vibe \u2013 Mikael, from Stavanger, in Norway, tells me he fell asleep in one of the restaurants, but was helpfully carried to his cabin by some Germans. With a Sabaton quiz, heavy-metal karaoke and a merchandise stall selling a bewildering number of items for all sizes, genders and tastes, it all feels very inclusive and cosy. The band\u2019s obsession with war stories ensures that we are all learning something, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"43669a5930470e6a0cfda561ae6d1f1ddf0affa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43669a5930470e6a0cfda561ae6d1f1ddf0affa6/0_627_2670_2669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans on the Sabaton Cruise\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans are united by their love of power metal and the minutiae of military history.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Grigoriadis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEvery school system I\u2019ve ever encountered has been very effective at turning something interesting, like history, into something boring,\u201d says Joakim Brod\u00e9n, the band\u2019s mohawked, musclebound frontman. \u201cOf course you have to learn facts and figures, but that can be so boring. If you zoom in and tell stories, like the tale of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvDg7UftJw8\" title=\"\">Witold Pilecki</a>, a guy who went voluntarily to infiltrate Auschwitz and support the resistance? These are human stories \u2013 people from every nation and every culture can relate to them.\u201d</p> <p>The band love military history so much that when they heard that a museum on the site of the UK\u2019s only first world war battle was in financial trouble \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.heughbattery.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Heugh Battery Museum</a> in Hartlepool \u2013 they created a special T-shirt design and raised \u00a34,000.</p> <p>As educational as their songs are designed to be, Sabaton are aware that their obsession with military events, and the grimmest aspects of war, could be misconstrued as ghoulish, flippant or possibly even politically dubious. There\u2019s no doubting that the band\u2019s motivations are entirely honourable, but Brod\u00e9n does say they have to remain mindful of the emotional power of these tumultuous tales. \u201cWe played the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epeQwq-aYV0\" title=\"\">40:1</a> on the battlefield in Wizna, Poland, exactly 70 years after the battle of Wizna happened,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had the Swedish ambassador there and 10,000 fans, and we were in the field where it actually happened \u2013 you could see the fire, literally, in the fans\u2019 eyes. Those songs are often the most fun but they can be a little scary, too. We\u2019re singing about military history because it\u2019s fascinating. We\u2019re not pushing nationalistic propaganda.\u201d</p> <p>Brod\u00e9n and bassist P\u00e4r Sundstr\u00f6m are the sole remaining members of the original Sabaton lineup, and have nurtured their band over two decades: Brod\u00e9n writes the music, while Sundstr\u00f6m seems to be responsible for everything else. Aside from being Sabaton\u2019s manager, he books their shows and deals with logistics, stage sets and a steady stream of new projects he can\u2019t stop dreaming up. \u201cNobody tells us when or where to play, how to build a stage, how to do accounting,\u201d he says. \u201cGive me a problem to solve and some tools \u2013 and I\u2019ll find something I can build with them. I\u2019ll want to build something bigger than everything else.\u201d</p> <p>This includes the Sabaton History channel. Sundstr\u00f6m\u2019s piercing blue eyes light up as he explains the thinking behind it. Conceived to flesh out the military stories behind the band\u2019s songs, each episode has led to a surge in streams and album sales. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not paying off in terms of direct income, but not everything needs to do that,\u201d he says, adding that they are turning their website in \u201can encyclopaedia of military history. You can see how each day in history relates to Sabaton. So you can read about it, watch it, listen to it \u2013 we\u2019ll get you one way or the other!\u201d</p> <p>On board the \u201cbattleship\u201d (in reality a standard cruise ship, albeit a huge one), there is plenty of evidence that Sabaton\u2019s remorseless pursuit of new ways to attract fans has led to the creation of a genuine community. Up to 40 different countries are represented among the cruise\u2019s 3,000 punters, and Brod\u00e9n seems thrilled to have brought so many people together. \u201cThe Polish fan club started hanging out with the German fan club and so on. I must\u2019ve bumped into 100 people I recognised yesterday.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6d171dbde8eecb1326f2897cb0514622c2cf555\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6d171dbde8eecb1326f2897cb0514622c2cf555/0_7_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans join the party in the middle of the Baltic Sea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans join the party in the middle of the Baltic Sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Grigoriadis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Several unexpectedly successful tours in the US disproved the notion that, as Sundstr\u00f6m claims to have been repeatedly told, \u201cAmericans don\u2019t like power metal\u201d. But even within metal circles, the Swedes have seldom been favoured candidates for world domination. Sabaton albums have generally been greeted with an appreciative but noncommittal shrug from the rock and metal press. So-called \u201cpower metal\u201d \u2013 a brightly melodic and fast-paced strain of old-school metal \u2013 has never sought to be cool, and is easily ignored. But while many younger, ostensibly cooler bands have risen and fallen, this defiantly traditional quintet have marched stoically onwards, oblivious to time or trends but dragging a phenomenal number of people along with them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been a steady, upward march. We\u2019ve never had a moment where we\u2019ve lost our footing,\u201d Brod\u00e9n notes, almost sheepishly. \u201cFor me, personally, I had one \u2018What the fuck?\u2019 moment in Athens in 2009. We were playing in an underground club, not a huge show, and I think we were playing Ghost Division. Suddenly, everything went into slow motion. I realised, \u2018Hmm, I\u2019m in Athens having a good time, playing a show, and I haven\u2019t done anything else for the past two years. I guess I\u2019m a professional musician!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"60c988055f44595e48ab08105a41109d0dc66d34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60c988055f44595e48ab08105a41109d0dc66d34/0_19_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Where to next?

A fan checks out the brochures on the Sabaton Cruise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Grigoriadis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe were never welcomed into the music industry, especially in Sweden,\u201d adds Sundstr\u00f6m. \u201cWe are the outsiders, the ugly guys that they don\u2019t want at their parties. A lot of people thought they could ignore us and we\u2019d go away, but they were wrong. Now they have a big problem because they have to write about us and we\u2019re selling their magazines, but they missed the boat, so to speak.\u201d He hoots with laughter.</p> <p>The ship is heading back to Stockholm and Sabaton are bringing the cruise to a close with a second lengthy set full of songs of heroism, bravery, tragedy and horror, with historically pertinent visuals blazing from screens behind them. The band are clearly having as much fun as the fans, despite being (we assume) considerably less inebriated. The last song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYWdgBtSM8s\" title=\"\">To Hell and Back</a>, is a blistering paean to the <a href=\"http://www.audiemurphy.com/poems.htm\" title=\"\">poetry of US veteran and actor Audie Murphy</a> and goes down so well it nearly sinks the ship. Brod\u00e9n and Sundstr\u00f6m bump fists and hug as the diehards chant their band\u2019s name.</p> <p>\u201cOur music and our lyrics speak the same emotional language,\u201d says Brod\u00e9n. \u201cIn metal, the spectrum can be anything from hatred and aggression through to happiness, joy and pride. That\u2019s all in this music already \u2013 and these military stories have it all, too. We didn\u2019t realise it at the beginning, but mixing those two things up was a fucking slam dunk!\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Sabaton play Wembley Arena, London, on Saturday 8 February</p>",

For all heavy metal\u2019s reputation for rowdiness, the Sabaton cruise has a lovely family vibe \u2013 Mikael, from Stavanger, in Norway, tells me he fell asleep in one of the restaurants, but was helpfully carried to his cabin by some Germans. With a Sabaton quiz, heavy-metal karaoke and a merchandise stall selling a bewildering number of items for all sizes, genders and tastes, it all feels very inclusive and cosy. The band\u2019s obsession with war stories ensures that we are all learning something, too. \u201cEvery school system I\u2019ve ever encountered has been very effective at turning something interesting, like history, into something boring,\u201d says Joakim Brod\u00e9n, the band\u2019s mohawked, musclebound frontman. \u201cOf course you have to learn facts and figures, but that can be so boring. If you zoom in and tell stories, like the tale of Witold Pilecki, a guy who went voluntarily to infiltrate Auschwitz and support the resistance? These are human stories \u2013 people from every nation and every culture can relate to them.\u201d The band love military history so much that when they heard that a museum on the site of the UK\u2019s only first world war battle was in financial trouble \u2013 Heugh Battery Museum in Hartlepool \u2013 they created a special T-shirt design and raised \u00a34,000. As educational as their songs are designed to be, Sabaton are aware that their obsession with military events, and the grimmest aspects of war, could be misconstrued as ghoulish, flippant or possibly even politically dubious. There\u2019s no doubting that the band\u2019s motivations are entirely honourable, but Brod\u00e9n does say they have to remain mindful of the emotional power of these tumultuous tales. \u201cWe played the song 40:1 on the battlefield in Wizna, Poland, exactly 70 years after the battle of Wizna happened,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had the Swedish ambassador there and 10,000 fans, and we were in the field where it actually happened \u2013 you could see the fire, literally, in the fans\u2019 eyes. Those songs are often the most fun but they can be a little scary, too. We\u2019re singing about military history because it\u2019s fascinating. We\u2019re not pushing nationalistic propaganda.\u201d Brod\u00e9n and bassist P\u00e4r Sundstr\u00f6m are the sole remaining members of the original Sabaton lineup, and have nurtured their band over two decades: Brod\u00e9n writes the music, while Sundstr\u00f6m seems to be responsible for everything else. Aside from being Sabaton\u2019s manager, he books their shows and deals with logistics, stage sets and a steady stream of new projects he can\u2019t stop dreaming up. \u201cNobody tells us when or where to play, how to build a stage, how to do accounting,\u201d he says. \u201cGive me a problem to solve and some tools \u2013 and I\u2019ll find something I can build with them. I\u2019ll want to build something bigger than everything else.\u201d This includes the Sabaton History channel. Sundstr\u00f6m\u2019s piercing blue eyes light up as he explains the thinking behind it. Conceived to flesh out the military stories behind the band\u2019s songs, each episode has led to a surge in streams and album sales. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not paying off in terms of direct income, but not everything needs to do that,\u201d he says, adding that they are turning their website in \u201can encyclopaedia of military history. You can see how each day in history relates to Sabaton. So you can read about it, watch it, listen to it \u2013 we\u2019ll get you one way or the other!\u201d On board the \u201cbattleship\u201d (in reality a standard cruise ship, albeit a huge one), there is plenty of evidence that Sabaton\u2019s remorseless pursuit of new ways to attract fans has led to the creation of a genuine community. Up to 40 different countries are represented among the cruise\u2019s 3,000 punters, and Brod\u00e9n seems thrilled to have brought so many people together. \u201cThe Polish fan club started hanging out with the German fan club and so on. I must\u2019ve bumped into 100 people I recognised yesterday.\u201d Several unexpectedly successful tours in the US disproved the notion that, as Sundstr\u00f6m claims to have been repeatedly told, \u201cAmericans don\u2019t like power metal\u201d. But even within metal circles, the Swedes have seldom been favoured candidates for world domination. Sabaton albums have generally been greeted with an appreciative but noncommittal shrug from the rock and metal press. So-called \u201cpower metal\u201d \u2013 a brightly melodic and fast-paced strain of old-school metal \u2013 has never sought to be cool, and is easily ignored. But while many younger, ostensibly cooler bands have risen and fallen, this defiantly traditional quintet have marched stoically onwards, oblivious to time or trends but dragging a phenomenal number of people along with them. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a steady, upward march. We\u2019ve never had a moment where we\u2019ve lost our footing,\u201d Brod\u00e9n notes, almost sheepishly. \u201cFor me, personally, I had one \u2018What the fuck?\u2019 moment in Athens in 2009. We were playing in an underground club, not a huge show, and I think we were playing Ghost Division. Suddenly, everything went into slow motion. I realised, \u2018Hmm, I\u2019m in Athens having a good time, playing a show, and I haven\u2019t done anything else for the past two years. I guess I\u2019m a professional musician!\u2019\u201d \u201cWe were never welcomed into the music industry, especially in Sweden,\u201d adds Sundstr\u00f6m. \u201cWe are the outsiders, the ugly guys that they don\u2019t want at their parties. A lot of people thought they could ignore us and we\u2019d go away, but they were wrong. Now they have a big problem because they have to write about us and we\u2019re selling their magazines, but they missed the boat, so to speak.\u201d He hoots with laughter. The ship is heading back to Stockholm and Sabaton are bringing the cruise to a close with a second lengthy set full of songs of heroism, bravery, tragedy and horror, with historically pertinent visuals blazing from screens behind them. The band are clearly having as much fun as the fans, despite being (we assume) considerably less inebriated. The last song, To Hell and Back, is a blistering paean to the poetry of US veteran and actor Audie Murphy and goes down so well it nearly sinks the ship. Brod\u00e9n and Sundstr\u00f6m bump fists and hug as the diehards chant their band\u2019s name. \u201cOur music and our lyrics speak the same emotional language,\u201d says Brod\u00e9n. \u201cIn metal, the spectrum can be anything from hatred and aggression through to happiness, joy and pride. That\u2019s all in this music already \u2013 and these military stories have it all, too. We didn\u2019t realise it at the beginning, but mixing those two things up was a fucking slam dunk!\u201d \u2022 Sabaton play Wembley Arena, London, on Saturday 8 February",

Big manufacturers such as BASF, Dow, Huhtamaki, Plantic, Mondi, and Amcor <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/12/02/money-in-bioplastics-for-sme#E25Dwi4c8bSC785T.99\">ramped up research into plastic from corn, wheat, potatoes, soyabean and cotton</a>. The market is still small but is <a href=\"https://bioplasticsnews.com/2019/08/08/global-bioplastics-market-to-grow-by-20/\">expected to grow 20% annually</a> into a $70bn a year industry by 2024.</p> <p>But critics said bioplastics were not the answer. Not only can they take up land needed for food production, but most bioplastics need high temperature industrial composting facilities to break them down. With few local authorities able to handle them, the result is most must go to landfills where they are likely to release methane, <a href=\"http://news.bio-based.eu/bioplastics-reduce-co2-emissions/\">a greenhouse gas 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide</a>.</p> <p>Industry attempts to appear green <a href=\"https://beyondplastics.org/news/\">mostly ended in confusion</a>. Products were increasingly classed as compostable, biodegradable, recyclable, reusable or bio-based. But most of these terms meant little. Biodegradable plastic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/29/biodegradable-plastic-bags-survive-three-years-in-soil-and-sea\">was found to be intact after years at sea</a>; not all compostable materials, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-compostable-plastics-may-be-no-better-for-the-environment-100016\">it was found</a>, could be composted at home; and recyclable depended on the local waste stream; with few standards and no timescale attached to bioplastics, many were described as false solutions.</p> <p>Faced with heavily polluted coastlines, a hostile media and angry tourists, the EU launched its plastics strategy in 2019 . This aims to ensure all plastic packaging is reusable or recyclable by 2030. It also calls for 90% of all plastic bottles to be recycled by 2025. The new UK government <a href=\"https://www.packagingnews.co.uk/news/queens-speech-outlines-government-strategy-plastic-19-12-2019\">has pledged to ban</a> the export of plastic waste to poor countries, and to introduce a tax on plastic packaging with less than 30% of recycled content from 2022. It also <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/gove-takes-action-to-ban-plastic-straws-stirrers-and-cotton-buds\">said it would stop by April 2020</a> the use of 4.7bn plastic straws, the 316m plastic stirrers and the 1.8bn plastic cotton buds used each year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18fe54ce8d0efc0ff4962c5e8067483b8ee161be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18fe54ce8d0efc0ff4962c5e8067483b8ee161be/0_0_5214_3606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A vendor puts clothes in a single-use plastic bag in Ngor village in Dakar, Senegal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A vendor puts clothes in a single-use plastic bag in Ngor village, Dakar.

Many US states <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/plastic-bag-legislation.aspx\">banned or said they were planning to phase out plastic bags</a>.</p> <p>The industry fought back. Companies may have promised publicly to stop using certain types of plastic, but their trade bodies lobbied strongly in 2019 against new laws and <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/budget-commissioners-plastic-tax-proposal-faces-resistance/\">argued to be allowed to continue to produce more</a>. Industry and supermarket trade groups lobbied against proposed deposit return schemes, bans and new recycling targets. The US industry responded with threatening lawsuits against local authorities and cities who tried to introduce bag bans.</p> <p>Instead of waiting for governments and industry, coalitions of global and local NGOs, international banks, conservation groups and some plastic producers <a href=\"https://www.stopoceanplastics.com/\">volunteered to clean up</a> rivers and beaches, and help governments collect and recycle waste. The UK-based Common Seas NGO worked with islands and resorts in the Maldives and Greece, and with city authorities in Indonesia to prevent plastic getting to the ocean. <a href=\"https://www.goodnet.org/articles/5-incredible-organizations-that-are-making-worlds-oceans-cleaner\">Volunteers cleared millions of pieces of plastic</a> from beaches in the Mediterranean, Middle East, Latin America, China <a href=\"https://thewire.in/environment/mumbais-versova-shore-transformed-due-worlds-largest-beach-cleanup-locals\">and India</a> beaches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bdf5bc1b1f4078249b6bc3dba01be3290a2c384\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bdf5bc1b1f4078249b6bc3dba01be3290a2c384/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker sweeps stacks of plastic bottles at a recycling plant in Dagenham, Essex, UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker sweeps stacks of plastic bottles at a recycling plant in Essex, UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Novel ways to collect plastic from rivers and oceans were introduced.

      "bodyText": "The beach at Muncar on the island of Java was revolting. The 400-yard wide, mile-long stretch of sand was feet deep in foul-smelling sauce sachets, shopping bags, nappies, bottles and bags, plastic clothes and detergent bottles. Bulldozers had cleared away and buried some of the huge mat of plastic and sand two years ago, but every tide since then had washed up more rubbish from the ocean, and every day tonnes more plastic was washed down the rivers from upstream towns and villages. Now it was fouling the fishing boats\u2019 propellers. \u201cWe fear for the future,\u201d one elderly woman said. She remembered Muncar only a decade ago as one of the most picturesque towns in Indonesia and a tourist hotspot. \u201cIf it carries on like this we will be buried in plastic. We have no choice but to throw plastic into the rivers. Now we are angry. Something must be done,\u201d she said. That was January 2019. One year later, the beach heaves with plastic but the local government, working with well-funded international advisers, a recycling company and an army of volunteer collectors have worked to stem the tide of plastic reaching its beaches. It will cost millions of dollars and take years but Muncar may soon have its sand back. But this small Indonesian town is the exception. 2019 was, for most of the world, the year the petrochemical industry and giant food, drink and beauty companies locked the world even further into fossil fuels, creating mountains of plastic for communities and future generations to deal with and making it almost too late to keep global temperatures in check. Ultra-cheap shale gas from the decade-long US fracking boom continued to fuel a surge of billion-dollar investments in new cracking plants that separate ethane from gas to produce ethylene, the building block of most plastic. Since 2010 the petrochemical industry has invested about $200bn, and with $100bn more planned to be spent, plastic production is expected to grow 40% by 2030. The implications for countries struggling to cope with climate change and thousands of communities fighting tides of plastic are only now being understood. From having little impact on the climate just 20 years ago, the production and disposal of plastic now uses nearly 14% of all the world\u2019s oil and gas. Plastic production is expected to grow to 20% by 2050 by which time the industry\u2019s climate emissions could rise to 2.75bn tonnes a year and plastic could be driving half of all oil demand growth. Plastic, says the International Energy Agency, could take up to 15% of the remaining annual carbon budget and make the fast-growing industry the equivalent of the world\u2019s fifth largest climate heating country, emitting more than Germany or the UK, twice as much as all African countries and nearly as much as shipping and aviation combined. Even as anger mounted in 2019 against rich countries\u2019 reluctance to act on climate change, it became clear that plastic was big oil\u2019s great hope for expansion, and one of the world\u2019s leading drivers of climate change. Shell\u2019s giant $6bn ethane-cracking plant being built near Pittsburgh, will produce 1.6m tons of plastic a year but is just one of dozens of similar size plants planned for the US, India, China and the Middle East. Despite UN hand-wringing and corporate pledges, demand for plastics grew a further 3.5% in 2019 and up to 16% in much of Asia. Latest figures suggest 359 m tonnes were produced in 2018. Nearly one-third went to single-use packaging and less than 10% was recycled. The rest went to landfills, was burned in incinerators adding to emissions and increasing air pollution, or was left uncollected, with approximately 8m tons making its way to the sea via rivers. But 2019 was also the year the worldwide revolt against plastic pollution translated into political and corporate action; when going plastic-free in Europe became trendy and giant food, drink and health companies were shamed. It was the year governments pledged new laws and when hundreds of potential solutions and initiatives were initiated. Great steps were taken by the public to clean up beaches and seas but in Britain the size of the task was underlined in November when a sperm whale was found on a Scottish beach. An examination of its stomach revealed a 100kg ball of plastic rope, fishing nets, cups, shopping bags, gloves, packing straps, tubing, sachets, bottles and all the waste of the global consumer society. Such beachings were common in 2019, with plastic-filled whales and cetaceans washed up in Wales, the Philippines, Indonesia, Italy and the US. Rattled by public disgust at the sight of choked animals and soiled coastlines, the packaging industry was forced to respond. Food and drink firms including Unilever, Mars, Danone, Pepsico and Coca-Cola pledged to reduce the amount of virgin plastic they used by 2025 and to increase the amount of recycled plastic. The global commitment on plastic, introduced in late 2018 to get corporations to pledge to use less and recycle more, grew to more than 400 of the world\u2019s biggest companies. Together they are responsible for more than 20% of all the plastic packaging produced. The UK supermarkets Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, Morrisons and Waitrose raced to ditch hard-to-recycle \u201cblack\u201d plastic from their ranges and to accelerate the amount of recycled material they use. Asda stated that nearly one-third of its plastic packaging would come from recycled sources by the end of 2020 and all should be recyclable by 2025. Waitrose said it had removed 90% of the 2,291 tonnes of black plastic. Some initiatives were eye-catching: Tesco pledged to remove 1bn pieces of plastic from products for sale in UK stores by the end of 2020. Sir David Attenborough detected a cultural change, telling the Glastonbury crowds that the world was changing its habits on plastic. But he may have been wrong. Greenpeace and the Environment Investigations Agency showed that more plastic than ever was put on shop shelves in 2019 and only Waitrose, Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s of the 10 biggest chains marginally reduced the amounts they used. Plastic water bottle sales, indeed, soared. Academic research, too, confirmed that pollution was worse than ever in 2019 and that the fishing industry was considerably responsible. The Dutch Ocean Cleanup project, working in the Great Pacific garbage patch, found more than half came from discarded plastic nets and rope, fish aggregating devices [FADs], buoys, long lines, crates and floats. French researchers showed how plastic litter at the bottom of the Mediterranean had tripled since 1990 and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimated that there would be more plastic than fish in the oceans by 2050 if business was allowed to continue as normal. Wherever researchers looked, they were horrified. One study found an estimated 1.8m pieces of plastic, old tyres and fishing gear on the sea floor of the Bay of Fundy between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in Canada; the WWF calculated that 570,000 tonnes of plastic went into the Mediterranean each year \u2013 the equivalent of 33,800 plastic bottles every minute and plastic was found widely in the food chain and in human bodies. Under pressure from governments but unwilling to produce less, the industry turned in 2019 to bioplastics, which convert the sugar present in plants and crop residues into plastic. Big manufacturers such as BASF, Dow, Huhtamaki, Plantic, Mondi, and Amcor ramped up research into plastic from corn, wheat, potatoes, soyabean and cotton. The market is still small but is expected to grow 20% annually into a $70bn a year industry by 2024. But critics said bioplastics were not the answer. Not only can they take up land needed for food production, but most bioplastics need high temperature industrial composting facilities to break them down. With few local authorities able to handle them, the result is most must go to landfills where they are likely to release methane, a greenhouse gas 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Industry attempts to appear green mostly ended in confusion. Products were increasingly classed as compostable, biodegradable, recyclable, reusable or bio-based. But most of these terms meant little. Biodegradable plastic was found to be intact after years at sea; not all compostable materials, it was found, could be composted at home; and recyclable depended on the local waste stream; with few standards and no timescale attached to bioplastics, many were described as false solutions. Faced with heavily polluted coastlines, a hostile media and angry tourists, the EU launched its plastics strategy in 2019 . This aims to ensure all plastic packaging is reusable or recyclable by 2030. It also calls for 90% of all plastic bottles to be recycled by 2025. The new UK government has pledged to ban the export of plastic waste to poor countries, and to introduce a tax on plastic packaging with less than 30% of recycled content from 2022. It also said it would stop by April 2020 the use of 4.7bn plastic straws, the 316m plastic stirrers and the 1.8bn plastic cotton buds used each year. Asian countries, faced with massively polluted coastlines and a swiftly growing plastics market, promised to act. India and Peru planned to eliminate all single-use plastic by 2022 and the Maldives said it would phase out all its non-biodegradable plastic. By the end of 2019, more than 120 countries had banned plastic bags and 60 more countries said they would impose taxes. Many US states banned or said they were planning to phase out plastic bags. The industry fought back. Companies may have promised publicly to stop using certain types of plastic, but their trade bodies lobbied strongly in 2019 against new laws and argued to be allowed to continue to produce more. Industry and supermarket trade groups lobbied against proposed deposit return schemes, bans and new recycling targets. The US industry responded with threatening lawsuits against local authorities and cities who tried to introduce bag bans. Instead of waiting for governments and industry, coalitions of global and local NGOs, international banks, conservation groups and some plastic producers volunteered to clean up rivers and beaches, and help governments collect and recycle waste. The UK-based Common Seas NGO worked with islands and resorts in the Maldives and Greece, and with city authorities in Indonesia to prevent plastic getting to the ocean. Volunteers cleared millions of pieces of plastic from beaches in the Mediterranean, Middle East, Latin America, China and India beaches. Novel ways to collect plastic from rivers and oceans were introduced. The Ocean Cleanup project launched the Interceptor, a barge-like vessel theoretically able to harvest up to 100,000kg of plastic waste a day from heavily polluted rivers. Waternet, which manages Amsterdam\u2019s canals, introduced a \u201cbubble barrier\u201d to catch floating debris. New Naval adapted oil-spill technology to invent a mesh barrier system to collect river plastic; and Mr Trash Wheel scooped rubbish out of the Jones Fall River in Baltimore with waterwheels. By the end of 2019, the war between the petrochemical companies and those who would stem their tides of plastic was fully engaged, but was still being largely won by the petrochemical industry. 2020 is widely seen to be critically important. In June the UN will host an oceans conference in Portugal at which worldwide progress will be assessed, and countries will pledge to prevent plastic pollution. Many proposed government bans should also come into force and hundreds of smaller initiatives to recycle more and reduce pollution should start to grow and make a difference. What is certain is that calls for a reduction in plastic use will grow louder and the industry will resist. But unless ways are found to use less, most of the efforts to stem the flood of plastic entering the environment are likely to prove temporary and insufficient. \u2022 A version of this article appears at commonseas.com",

The motorist was said to be nearly six times the limit when he was detained at the roadside on the M66 in Greater Manchester in the early hours of Wednesday. North West Motorway police posted photos of the car\u2019s bare wheels on Twitter, describing the incident as \u201cunbelievable\u201d.

When they breathalysed him, they said he was found to have 196mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35mg. Greater Manchester traffic police said the discovery was \u201cno surprise\u201d given the car was not fit for the road. The driver was charged with driving a motor vehicle on a road while over the prescribed limit for alcohol, contrary to section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, and will appear in court later this month. The M66 between Lancashire and Greater Manchester links the M60 Manchester outer ring road to the A56. Data released by the Department for Transport (DfT) last year showed the number of people killed in drink-drive crashes on Britain\u2019s roads had reached an eight-year high. Wednesday saw a spate of serious collisions, including the death of a 37-year-old motorist who died just minutes into the new year after his car crashed into a tree in the Great Barr area of Birmingham. Three motorists were also killed in Greater Manchester through Tuesday night into New Year\u2019s Day, including taxi driver Saleem Pacha, 59. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 January 2020 because an earlier version said that the detained driver was alleged to be six times over the drink-drive limit.

A fundraising page named BA Angels was set up by fellow cabin crew member Stephen Paul Crook and has raised nearly \u00a345,000 so far. Malgorzata Kubik posted on the page: \u201cJoe was my coach and he always made sure we were OK. I hope he is in a better place now and I would like to send big hugs to his friends and family I am with you in this painful and difficult time especially of that time a year.\u201d Laura Stewart said: \u201cDom and Joe were truly special men and I hope that their families take some comfort in knowing that they were so loved by everyone they have flown with! I\u2019ll miss you.\u201d Posting on Facebook, Bailey Faulkner said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t thank you both for the endless trips together all across the world which each time was full of boozing and laughter, not forgetting the days spent sat in the pub! Gutted you\u2019ve gone but you\u2019ll never be forgotten! Keep flying high.\u201d Hanushe Lala described Clark as \u201ca kind, beautiful and intelligent person who only ever brightened up everyone\u2019s day\u201d. \u201cYou will always have a special place in my heart, forever and always,\u201d she said. It is understood two of the four crew members had finished work at about 6pm, and the other two had the day off. A BA spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019re deeply saddened to learn of the death of our colleagues involved in a road traffic collision last night. Our thoughts are with their family and friends, who we are supporting at this distressing time.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s technology industry is booming. Its tech firms attracted more than \u00a36bn of venture capital funding in 2018, according to <a href=\"https://technation.io/report2019/#10-global-performance\">Tech Nation</a>, more than any other European country. Around 80% of tech investment in the UK is in fast-growing businesses, creating new jobs, revolutionary products and innovative services. Yet, women are missing out on this entrepreneurial success, <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/en/action/gender-equality/Documents/EQUALS%20Research%20Report%202019.pdf\">making up just 17</a>% of of IT specialists in the UK. Worse still, a new survey shows that <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252474971/Percentage-of-women-in-tech-remains-low-at-16-with-little-growth-in-10-years\">the number of women in the tech sector has barely moved</a> over the past 10 years despite an industry-wide push. When tech has never had it so good, where are the women?</p> <p>Much has been written about male domination of the tech world. Many tech companies are run by men, and female role models are few and far between. At its worst, the industry has cultivated a toxic \u201cbro culture\u201d, exemplified by Uber\u2019s founder Travis Kalanick who was forced to step down as chief executive of the ride-sharing company, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/20/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resigns\">accused of creating a sexist work culture</a> that discriminated against female employees.</p> <p>Others point to the lack of girls taking Stem \u2013 science, technology, engineering and maths \u2013 subjects to an advanced level, weakening the pipeline of young women into tech-related industries. Just 9% of female graduates in 2018 studied a core <a href=\"https://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/statistics/core-stem-graduates-2018/\">Stem subject, according to education campaign WISE</a>. But misconceptions about tech can also cause some women to overlook the opportunities available in the digital world.</p> <p>Vanessa Vallely, founder of membership organisation WeAreTechWomen, believes the problems start at school, but points out that even those who break into the tech industry struggle. This view is borne out by past <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/03/whats-holding-women-back-in-science-and-technology-industries\">research by Harvard Business Review</a>, which indicated that US women working in science, engineering and technology fields were 45% more likely than their male colleagues to quit within a year of taking a job. Vallely says: \u201cWomen just aren\u2019t getting promoted into senior tech roles. There\u2019s a real lack of sponsorship, people in senior positions \u2013 typically men \u2013 supporting women\u2019s work and efforts. Companies recognise 17% isn\u2019t good enough and say they\u2019re looking for women to promote. But if they want the right balance in the room, they need to help women at the middle level to progress.\u201d</p> <p>More businesses are trying to address gender imbalance and hundreds have signed up to the <a href=\"https://www.techtalentcharter.co.uk/\">Tech Talent Charter</a>, a government-backed initiative that commits participants to adopt recruitment and retention practices to create a more diverse tech workforce, setting clear goals and being transparent about results. The charter is set to reach 600 signatories by the end of 2020, with big names including Capgemini, Vodafone and Lloyds Banking Group, as well as many medium-sized tech firms and startups.</p> <p>Nicola Anderson is chief marketing officer at MyTutor, a London-based edtech firm that provides affordable tutoring for GCSE and A-level students online. Having worked in various tech businesses over the past 20 years, Anderson recognises the barriers her industry can pose to women. But she also believes many women\u2019s lack of confidence is hindering their progression.</p> <p>\u201cAs in other industries, women in tech often won\u2019t apply for a job if they don\u2019t feel they\u2019re 100% qualified or have exactly the right experience,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a result, women end up moving horizontally where their male peers progress.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, Anderson took a qualification in coaching and mentoring and, on top of her day job, works with women encouraging them to overcome their professional fears. She explains: \u201cThere are perceptions of tech as involving long hours and, in some businesses, benefits have been more about having beers one day of the week or providing table tennis in the office than pensions provision, healthcare or flexible working for parents. Those can put women off, but the industry has changed and is growing up. Part-time roles and flexibility are commonplace. I also hear women say they can\u2019t work in tech because they\u2019re not technical. The majority of people aren\u2019t engineers or coders. There are lots of different roles and many women have great transferable skills, if only they knew it.\u201d</p> <p>Anderson has also witnessed a strong push from job candidates and new recruits demanding change. She adds: \u201cHiring talent in tech is incredibly competitive and potential employees choose businesses based on the employer brand and how much they value culture, diversity and work-life balance. Companies not focusing on these things are missing out on hiring the best people.\u201d</p> <p>More than eight out of 10 female millennials in Britain say they seek out employers with a strong record on diversity, equality and inclusion, <a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/women-in-technology/women-in-tech-report.pdf\">according to research</a>. But while this push from the bottom is having an impact, Maddy Cross, talent director of venture capital firm Notion, which specialises in investing in tech businesses, thinks men in authority still have a huge role to play in changing attitudes and culture.</p> <p>\u201cMen at the top have to believe and support their female employees and peers when they highlight the micro-sexism happening in business every day,\u201d Cross says. \u201cI was the only woman at a tech event recently and one man came up to me to thank me for ordering his taxi. It\u2019s a small example, but the very men who lament the shortage of women in leadership in tech can still be unwittingly dismissive. Attitudes are improving and I now work in a business where I always feel listened to.\u201d</p> <p>Cross\u2019s role involves working with investee businesses to build experienced management teams. Many male founders say they want to hire women, but she is quick to ask what they really want to achieve: \u201cAre you hiring a woman to check a box or is it because you genuinely want a different perspective?\u201d she asks. \u201cIf it\u2019s the former, then it\u2019s not likely to go well. Equally, I\u2019ve worked with some men who have the right attitude, but they just haven\u2019t found the right candidate yet, so I tell them to keep looking and perhaps look somewhere different. Given there are so few women in tech to start with, if you want a female chief financial officer, don\u2019t steal one from another business, hire a talented female CFO from another industry. Create new talent. The issues around female leadership aren\u2019t likely to be fixed in the next 10 years, but the symptoms are being acknowledged, which is a good thing.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s technology industry is booming. Its tech firms attracted more than \u00a36bn of venture capital funding in 2018, according to Tech Nation, more than any other European country. Around 80% of tech investment in the UK is in fast-growing businesses, creating new jobs, revolutionary products and innovative services. Yet, women are missing out on this entrepreneurial success, making up just 17% of of IT specialists in the UK. Worse still, a new survey shows that the number of women in the tech sector has barely moved over the past 10 years despite an industry-wide push. When tech has never had it so good, where are the women? Much has been written about male domination of the tech world. Many tech companies are run by men, and female role models are few and far between. At its worst, the industry has cultivated a toxic \u201cbro culture\u201d, exemplified by Uber\u2019s founder Travis Kalanick who was forced to step down as chief executive of the ride-sharing company, accused of creating a sexist work culture that discriminated against female employees. Others point to the lack of girls taking Stem \u2013 science, technology, engineering and maths \u2013 subjects to an advanced level, weakening the pipeline of young women into tech-related industries. Just 9% of female graduates in 2018 studied a core Stem subject, according to education campaign WISE. But misconceptions about tech can also cause some women to overlook the opportunities available in the digital world. Vanessa Vallely, founder of membership organisation WeAreTechWomen, believes the problems start at school, but points out that even those who break into the tech industry struggle. This view is borne out by past research by Harvard Business Review, which indicated that US women working in science, engineering and technology fields were 45% more likely than their male colleagues to quit within a year of taking a job. Vallely says: \u201cWomen just aren\u2019t getting promoted into senior tech roles. There\u2019s a real lack of sponsorship, people in senior positions \u2013 typically men \u2013 supporting women\u2019s work and efforts. Companies recognise 17% isn\u2019t good enough and say they\u2019re looking for women to promote. But if they want the right balance in the room, they need to help women at the middle level to progress.\u201d More businesses are trying to address gender imbalance and hundreds have signed up to the Tech Talent Charter, a government-backed initiative that commits participants to adopt recruitment and retention practices to create a more diverse tech workforce, setting clear goals and being transparent about results. The charter is set to reach 600 signatories by the end of 2020, with big names including Capgemini, Vodafone and Lloyds Banking Group, as well as many medium-sized tech firms and startups. Nicola Anderson is chief marketing officer at MyTutor, a London-based edtech firm that provides affordable tutoring for GCSE and A-level students online. Having worked in various tech businesses over the past 20 years, Anderson recognises the barriers her industry can pose to women. But she also believes many women\u2019s lack of confidence is hindering their progression. \u201cAs in other industries, women in tech often won\u2019t apply for a job if they don\u2019t feel they\u2019re 100% qualified or have exactly the right experience,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a result, women end up moving horizontally where their male peers progress.\u201d In recent years, Anderson took a qualification in coaching and mentoring and, on top of her day job, works with women encouraging them to overcome their professional fears. She explains: \u201cThere are perceptions of tech as involving long hours and, in some businesses, benefits have been more about having beers one day of the week or providing table tennis in the office than pensions provision, healthcare or flexible working for parents. Those can put women off, but the industry has changed and is growing up. Part-time roles and flexibility are commonplace. I also hear women say they can\u2019t work in tech because they\u2019re not technical. The majority of people aren\u2019t engineers or coders. There are lots of different roles and many women have great transferable skills, if only they knew it.\u201d Anderson has also witnessed a strong push from job candidates and new recruits demanding change. She adds: \u201cHiring talent in tech is incredibly competitive and potential employees choose businesses based on the employer brand and how much they value culture, diversity and work-life balance. Companies not focusing on these things are missing out on hiring the best people.\u201d More than eight out of 10 female millennials in Britain say they seek out employers with a strong record on diversity, equality and inclusion, according to research. But while this push from the bottom is having an impact, Maddy Cross, talent director of venture capital firm Notion, which specialises in investing in tech businesses, thinks men in authority still have a huge role to play in changing attitudes and culture. \u201cMen at the top have to believe and support their female employees and peers when they highlight the micro-sexism happening in business every day,\u201d Cross says. \u201cI was the only woman at a tech event recently and one man came up to me to thank me for ordering his taxi. It\u2019s a small example, but the very men who lament the shortage of women in leadership in tech can still be unwittingly dismissive. Attitudes are improving and I now work in a business where I always feel listened to.\u201d Cross\u2019s role involves working with investee businesses to build experienced management teams. Many male founders say they want to hire women, but she is quick to ask what they really want to achieve: \u201cAre you hiring a woman to check a box or is it because you genuinely want a different perspective?\u201d she asks. \u201cIf it\u2019s the former, then it\u2019s not likely to go well. Equally, I\u2019ve worked with some men who have the right attitude, but they just haven\u2019t found the right candidate yet, so I tell them to keep looking and perhaps look somewhere different. Given there are so few women in tech to start with, if you want a female chief financial officer, don\u2019t steal one from another business, hire a talented female CFO from another industry. Create new talent. The issues around female leadership aren\u2019t likely to be fixed in the next 10 years, but the symptoms are being acknowledged, which is a good thing.\u201d",

A few pages in, her book seems to be just that; it makes some mildly entertaining but not revelatory points about human blindspots, both physical (in the eye), and societal (refusing to believe that the Earth is round). Its premise is only briefly explained, with a worthy quote from Carl Sagan that \u201cour species needs, and deserves, a citizenry with minds wide awake and a basic understanding of how the world works\u201d. </p> <p>After a few pages of porridge eating, some tasty morsels appear, as Tong starts to use ever more gripping examples to make her point about how much we do not see. \u201cTo us,\u201d she writes, \u201creality may appear human-sized, but in truth 95% of all animal species are smaller than the human thumb.\u201d</p> <p>The matter and life we cannot see are demonstrated with stunning effect. Bacterial cells make up 0.2kg of your body weight; one handful of soil contains more microbes than there are people on Earth; the tiny particles called neutrinos generated by the sun\u2019s nuclear fusion are so small that they can penetrate the Earth, enabling a subterranean observatory to come up with an image of the sun.</p> <p>The density and frequency of the details showing the scale of life around us almost inspires a feeling of vertigo, so rapidly does Tong make the reader zoom in. By the time I got to the meat slaughter and processed food section (one of our \u201cbiological blind spots\u201d), I was so sure Tong was going to hit me with something unfamiliar and horrific that I wasn\u2019t sure I could proceed. She didn\u2019t disappoint: in a gruesome paragraph on poultry processing plants, she provides the detail that chickens are often not mounted properly on the slaughter line before they are immersed in boiling water. The result is that \u201canywhere from 700,000 to 1 million birds a year are still conscious when they are scalded to death in the scalder\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7de70d62f403526f5a73d784d97b4e00313c8f37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7de70d62f403526f5a73d784d97b4e00313c8f37/0_164_5620_3372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyanobacteria or \u2018blue-green\u2019 algae, which develop at the surface of a slow-flowing river in France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyanobacteria or \u2018blue-green\u2019 algae, which develop at the surface of a slow-flowing river in France.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In three sections \u2013 on biology, society and civilisation \u2013 Tong relentlessly focuses on all the things we either do not know, or decide not to pay attention to, as we carry on with our lives. Considering how much she gets through, the tone is light and accessible. It feels like being shown around a fascinating exhibit by an enthusiastic curator. Yet <em>The Reality Bubble</em> is essentially a warning: our blind spots, Tong contends, are responsible for the destruction of our habitat. The little-known facts she entertainingly provides serve the argument that humans have subordinated the elements and the animal kingdom to our will and our desire for consumption, and in doing so have sown the seeds of our own demise.</p> <p>From a chimpanzee with a photographic memory to beetles that navigate by means of the Milky Way, Tong\u2019s revelatory examples inspire a sense of wonder. In doing so, the author succeeds in highlighting the folly of the idea of human exceptionalism and how, if we are to survive as a species, we need to get very good at scale, and fast. But she doesn\u2019t preach, nailing the \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d technique that is so important in such a work. The book doesn\u2019t appeal to a mawkish sympathy for animals, merely showing why there is a balance to nature, while making clear that there is so much about other creatures we are blind to.</p> <p>Tong also discusses time, space and ownership as initially useful concepts that became co-opted in the march towards efficiency and more profit. In a striking passage she writes that \u201cthe illusion of free time is the ouroboros of capitalism. Leisure has entered the marketplace so that it feeds back into the economy\u201d.</p> <p>By the time Tong (perhaps inevitably) quotes Harari in her conclusion, it is clear that <em>The Reality Bubble</em> is no knock-off but a new addition to the \u201chuman journey\u201d genre. It is not just a book that tells a story of humanity; it is a gentle but highly effective wake-up call.</p> <p>\u2022<em> The Reality Bubble is published by Canongate.

A few pages in, her book seems to be just that; it makes some mildly entertaining but not revelatory points about human blindspots, both physical (in the eye), and societal (refusing to believe that the Earth is round). Its premise is only briefly explained, with a worthy quote from Carl Sagan that \u201cour species needs, and deserves, a citizenry with minds wide awake and a basic understanding of how the world works\u201d. After a few pages of porridge eating, some tasty morsels appear, as Tong starts to use ever more gripping examples to make her point about how much we do not see. \u201cTo us,\u201d she writes, \u201creality may appear human-sized, but in truth 95% of all animal species are smaller than the human thumb.\u201d The matter and life we cannot see are demonstrated with stunning effect. Bacterial cells make up 0.2kg of your body weight; one handful of soil contains more microbes than there are people on Earth; the tiny particles called neutrinos generated by the sun\u2019s nuclear fusion are so small that they can penetrate the Earth, enabling a subterranean observatory to come up with an image of the sun. The density and frequency of the details showing the scale of life around us almost inspires a feeling of vertigo, so rapidly does Tong make the reader zoom in. By the time I got to the meat slaughter and processed food section (one of our \u201cbiological blind spots\u201d), I was so sure Tong was going to hit me with something unfamiliar and horrific that I wasn\u2019t sure I could proceed. She didn\u2019t disappoint: in a gruesome paragraph on poultry processing plants, she provides the detail that chickens are often not mounted properly on the slaughter line before they are immersed in boiling water. The result is that \u201canywhere from 700,000 to 1 million birds a year are still conscious when they are scalded to death in the scalder\u201d. In three sections \u2013 on biology, society and civilisation \u2013 Tong relentlessly focuses on all the things we either do not know, or decide not to pay attention to, as we carry on with our lives. Considering how much she gets through, the tone is light and accessible. It feels like being shown around a fascinating exhibit by an enthusiastic curator. Yet The Reality Bubble is essentially a warning: our blind spots, Tong contends, are responsible for the destruction of our habitat. The little-known facts she entertainingly provides serve the argument that humans have subordinated the elements and the animal kingdom to our will and our desire for consumption, and in doing so have sown the seeds of our own demise. From a chimpanzee with a photographic memory to beetles that navigate by means of the Milky Way, Tong\u2019s revelatory examples inspire a sense of wonder. In doing so, the author succeeds in highlighting the folly of the idea of human exceptionalism and how, if we are to survive as a species, we need to get very good at scale, and fast. But she doesn\u2019t preach, nailing the \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d technique that is so important in such a work. The book doesn\u2019t appeal to a mawkish sympathy for animals, merely showing why there is a balance to nature, while making clear that there is so much about other creatures we are blind to. Tong also discusses time, space and ownership as initially useful concepts that became co-opted in the march towards efficiency and more profit. In a striking passage she writes that \u201cthe illusion of free time is the ouroboros of capitalism. Leisure has entered the marketplace so that it feeds back into the economy\u201d. By the time Tong (perhaps inevitably) quotes Harari in her conclusion, it is clear that The Reality Bubble is no knock-off but a new addition to the \u201chuman journey\u201d genre. It is not just a book that tells a story of humanity; it is a gentle but highly effective wake-up call. \u2022 The Reality Bubble is published by Canongate.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At the Victorian coastal inlet of Mallacoota, which is among 20 towns that have been isolated by the fires since Tuesday, between 3,000 and 4,000 people were facing an impending food and water shortage as they waited to be evacuated by sea.</p> \n<p>On Thursday afternoon, Australian defence force officials said they expected to relocate 800 people using the naval ship HMAS Choules, while others will be airlifted out.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lindareynoldswa/status/1212585225949077510\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Evacuation plans for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mallacoota?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Mallacoota</a> are underway, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/YourADF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#YourADF</a> works with emergency services to prepare transferring people to HMAS Choules tomorrow AM. <br><br>Commanding Officer of Choules, CMDR Houlihan, led the ADF team onshore today to provide timely and relevant support. <a href=\"https://t.co/ecphjfLg9f\">pic.twitter.com/ecphjfLg9f</a></p>\u2014 Linda Reynolds (@lindareynoldswa) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lindareynoldswa/status/1212585225949077510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 2, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>New South Wales has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/02/nsw-state-of-emergency-what-does-it-mean-for-the-bushfires-crisis\">declared a seven-day state of emergency</a> before extreme conditions, including temperatures exceeding 40C, return to the south coast, Snowy Mountains and the outskirts of Sydney on Friday and Saturday.</p> \n<p>Evacuation orders were issued to holidaymakers from Batemans Bay to the Victorian border and people were advised that two highway escape routes were opened \u2013 north to Sydney along the Princes Highway, and south, via the Monaro Highway, hooking back to Canberra through Cooma.

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of people remained stranded on Thursday evening while attempting to flee bushfire-ravaged areas of the south-east Australian coast \u2013 having earlier been urged to leave before the return of extreme and dangerous weather conditions. The mass evacuation of communities in New South Wales and Victoria is among the largest ever emergency movements of people in Australia. The numbers fleeing the bushfire crisis remain unclear, but are expected to compare to the 60,000 people who were flown out of Darwin after Cyclone Tracy in 1974. Visitors told to flee a vast evacuation area along the NSW south coast reported sitting in gridlock for up to 10 hours after responding to the order to evacuate, as further outbreaks of fire and sheer weight of traffic blocked escape routes north of Ulladulla and near Cooma in the Snowy Mountains. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, urged people to be patient, as he again deflected criticism about his government\u2019s policies to address the causes of climate change. \u201cI know you can have kids in the car and there is anxiety and there is stress and the traffic is not moving quickly but the best thing to do \u2013 the best thing that helps those out there volunteering, out there trying to restore some order to these situations, is for everyone to be patient,\u201d Morrison said. On Thursday afternoon an angry protester told Morrison he should be \u201cashamed of himself\u201d and that he had \u201cleft the country to burn\u201d during a tour of the burnt out town of Cobargo. Authorities in Victoria hold grave fears for 17 people missing across the state, and advised anyone who could do so to leave fire-affected places in the East Gippsland region. At the Victorian coastal inlet of Mallacoota, which is among 20 towns that have been isolated by the fires since Tuesday, between 3,000 and 4,000 people were facing an impending food and water shortage as they waited to be evacuated by sea. On Thursday afternoon, Australian defence force officials said they expected to relocate 800 people using the naval ship HMAS Choules, while others will be airlifted out. New South Wales has declared a seven-day state of emergency before extreme conditions, including temperatures exceeding 40C, return to the south coast, Snowy Mountains and the outskirts of Sydney on Friday and Saturday. Evacuation orders were issued to holidaymakers from Batemans Bay to the Victorian border and people were advised that two highway escape routes were opened \u2013 north to Sydney along the Princes Highway, and south, via the Monaro Highway, hooking back to Canberra through Cooma. But on Thursday evening both routes were at a standstill as the fire threat lingered, with tailbacks of up to 25km reported. The northern route was blocked from about midday by a bushfire that closed the Princes Highway. Motorists heading north were advised to delay their trip or take shelter at Ulladulla. The road remained closed about 6pm. Motorists were reported abandoning their cars or heading to the south. The southern route was also hampered by a bushfire that came close to the Monaro Highway and caused delays north of Cooma. Witnesses said the lines of stationary traffic near Cooma were more than 30km long. Residents in the town of Batlow, famous for its apples, were advised to leave by Friday morning because of forecast fire danger in the Kosciuszko national park and surrounding areas. The entire park has been evacuated and authorities warned conditions were likely to be so severe that surrounding towns could not be defended. NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said conditions on Saturday were forecast to be worse than those on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cThose fires have spread at the absolute worst-case scenario, which typically is not what happens when it plays out on the ground,\u201d Fitzsimmons said. \u201cThe conditions on Saturday are likely to be worse than New Year\u2019s Eve and a lot of those areas in the south-east quadrant of the state have the potential to be impacted and impacted very heavily.\u201d The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said the state of emergency from Friday would give emergency services the authority to undertake forced evacuations and road closures at short notice. \u201cWe don\u2019t take these decisions lightly but we also want to make sure we\u2019re taking every single precaution to be prepared for what could be a horrible day on Saturday,\u201d she said. Since Christmas Day, nine people have been killed in bushfires across New South Wales and Victoria, while 17 people have died since the season began. About 150 fires continued to burn in Victoria and NSW on Thursday afternoon and officials warned they would be unable to control the blazes before conditions worsen. \u201cWe have no capacity to contain these fires \u2026 the fires are going to do what they are going to do, and people have to get out of that area,\u201d NSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said. Earlier on Tuesday, Morrison attended the funeral of Geoffrey Keaton, a volunteer firefighter who died on 19 December when his truck rolled at Green Wattle Creek, south of Sydney.

I\u2019ve limited myself to Britain this time, because that brings the number of races to consider down to a manageable 100,000 or so. The main criterion is which races still live clearly in my memory, so it\u2019s a very personal list with which you are almost certain to disagree, in which case please add your own list in the comments.</p> \n<h2><strong>5) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbwHOTKhyTQ\">Card played late</a></strong></h2> \n<p>Cue Card\u2019s epic career fits snugly into the decade, as he made his first appearance in a Fontwell bumper on 25 January 2010 and his last in the Ryanair of 2018. Few horses offered such a guarantee of drama; there were two Festival wins but also two falls in the Gold Cup, including one when he really might have won it. But the race to remember him for was at Kempton, when he ran down a non-staying Vautour in the final strides. Silviniaco Conti, Don Cossack, Smad Place and Al Ferof provided a fine supporting cast.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbwHOTKhyTQ\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wbwHOTKhyTQ?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>4) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_-ajr_kUko\">Lightning Power</a></strong></h2> \n<p>Tipsters love predictable horses and Sole Power was that for sure. Give him five furlongs on fast ground and you\u2019d see something electric. I\u2019ve picked his second win in the King\u2019s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot, in 2014, but there were a few days when he ran very similar races, being held up for an irresistible late surge that was thrilling to watch, whether you were for him or against. It feels important to include one of the many wins achieved by Richard Hughes, who looked better on a hold-up horse than any other jockey in my memory, folded up like one of those Jacob\u2019s Ladder toys, suggesting there was any amount left in the tank.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_-ajr_kUko\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q_-ajr_kUko?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>3) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdFg9FQ_jD8\">Enable v Crystal Ocean</a></strong></h2> \n<p>Some risk of recency bias here, since this King George (Ascot version) was just over five months ago, but it featured a record-setting champion prevailing after a prolonged tussle, with several Group One winners behind her. Maybe I should have this higher on the list? He didn\u2019t win but Crystal Ocean came out best at the weights and this race will be the best memorial for a splendidly game horse who seems sure to be under-appreciated by history.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdFg9FQ_jD8\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fdFg9FQ_jD8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>2) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQajCQ1_BSA\">Frankel\u2019s Guineas</a></strong></h2> \n<p>One of the most astonishing performances ever seen on a racecourse anywhere, as the combustible Frankel was allowed to stride on from the start. He was soon clear and stayed there, the crowd applauding from more than a furlong out. You can use the placed horses to pull down the value of the form but we know that Frankel was one of the greats. This win, with its unorthodox tactics, was the reassurance that he wasn\u2019t just going to be remembered as a flashy two-year-old.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQajCQ1_BSA\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JQajCQ1_BSA?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>1) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdHllGQHOOg\">Giants collide</a></strong></h2> \n<p>We spent so many years building up the Gold Cup as a clash between Kauto Star and Denman but the battle we were hoping for didn\u2019t really come off. Kauto Star seemed off his game in 2008, then Denman had the heart problem that undermined his career. By the time of the 2011 race, they were both 11 and still hugely talented but surely past their best. And yet there they both were, duking for the lead over the third-last and into the straight, before youth swept past in the figure of Long Run, just six and so full of promise.

      "bodyText": "You might take the view that the end of the decade is actually a year away, but at least it\u2019s 10 years since I last did something like this. I\u2019ve limited myself to Britain this time, because that brings the number of races to consider down to a manageable 100,000 or so. The main criterion is which races still live clearly in my memory, so it\u2019s a very personal list with which you are almost certain to disagree, in which case please add your own list in the comments. 5) Card played late Cue Card\u2019s epic career fits snugly into the decade, as he made his first appearance in a Fontwell bumper on 25 January 2010 and his last in the Ryanair of 2018. Few horses offered such a guarantee of drama; there were two Festival wins but also two falls in the Gold Cup, including one when he really might have won it. But the race to remember him for was at Kempton, when he ran down a non-staying Vautour in the final strides. Silviniaco Conti, Don Cossack, Smad Place and Al Ferof provided a fine supporting cast. 4) Lightning Power Tipsters love predictable horses and Sole Power was that for sure. Give him five furlongs on fast ground and you\u2019d see something electric. I\u2019ve picked his second win in the King\u2019s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot, in 2014, but there were a few days when he ran very similar races, being held up for an irresistible late surge that was thrilling to watch, whether you were for him or against. It feels important to include one of the many wins achieved by Richard Hughes, who looked better on a hold-up horse than any other jockey in my memory, folded up like one of those Jacob\u2019s Ladder toys, suggesting there was any amount left in the tank. 3) Enable v Crystal Ocean Some risk of recency bias here, since this King George (Ascot version) was just over five months ago, but it featured a record-setting champion prevailing after a prolonged tussle, with several Group One winners behind her. Maybe I should have this higher on the list? He didn\u2019t win but Crystal Ocean came out best at the weights and this race will be the best memorial for a splendidly game horse who seems sure to be under-appreciated by history. 2) Frankel\u2019s Guineas One of the most astonishing performances ever seen on a racecourse anywhere, as the combustible Frankel was allowed to stride on from the start. He was soon clear and stayed there, the crowd applauding from more than a furlong out. You can use the placed horses to pull down the value of the form but we know that Frankel was one of the greats. This win, with its unorthodox tactics, was the reassurance that he wasn\u2019t just going to be remembered as a flashy two-year-old. 1) Giants collide We spent so many years building up the Gold Cup as a clash between Kauto Star and Denman but the battle we were hoping for didn\u2019t really come off. Kauto Star seemed off his game in 2008, then Denman had the heart problem that undermined his career. By the time of the 2011 race, they were both 11 and still hugely talented but surely past their best. And yet there they both were, duking for the lead over the third-last and into the straight, before youth swept past in the figure of Long Run, just six and so full of promise. That admirable pair Imperial Commander and Tidal Bay were also in the line-up. And the memory is sweetened by the knowledge that this wasn\u2019t even Kauto Star\u2019s last hurrah, as he had a Betfair Chase and a King George to win later that year. It was one of the most purely enjoyable races I can remember. Thursday\u2019s best bets Brian Hughes might improve his chance of a first jockeys\u2019 title at Ayr, despite the presence of the reigning champ, Richard Johnson. Hughes replaces a 7lb claimer aboard Teescomponentstrig (1.00), who was a strong-finishing second on his handicap debut last month. The 9-4 is fair. Portrush Ted is the big name on the card but it\u2019s not clear that he\u2019s got in lightly on this handicap debut, even if he is at his best, which must be in doubt after such a long absence and with the yard in modest form. Eternally Yours (2.40) could be a better bet at 4-1, as she surely needed her reappearance run at Carlisle in November. At Lingfield, Deadly Accurate (3.30) could be worth a look at 7-1 on his first start for Ian Williams. He was rated 20lb higher at the end of 2018 and Joe Fanning is an encouraging booking for a potential front-runner.",

The gift of journalism is the chance to tell the stories of those who would otherwise not be heard, and journalism tends to be worthwhile in direct proportion to how much this is its goal. In general, people are happy to have someone interested in them enough to tell their stories; the only segments of society who try to avoid being written about are those who feel that the media might threaten their tight hold on power. If you are a reporter and you find yourself talking to evasive PR people more than regular people, you are probably writing about the wrong things. This is always a hazard. Prestige in media is bestowed on absurd things. The most prestigious job, White House correspondent, is also the worst. At best, it offers the hope of schmoozing with bureaucratic leeches for bits of gossip that can be spun into news; more often, it involves looking good at televised press conferences while being lied to by officials.</p> <p>Likewise, the media attention lavished on presidential conventions is matched by an absolute lack of news. I covered three of them, and never heard a single newsworthy thing at any of them that did not come out of the mouth of a protester who was barred from actually accessing the convention by many well-armed police. America would be better off setting up a single live camera on the convention stage, and then sending the thousands of political reporters out to talk to homeless people instead. That would offer at least the hope of capturing some insight about what is happening in the country.</p> <p>There exists in journalism a discernible divide between those who see it as a cause, and those who see it as a career that might enable them to hang out with important people and get a hefty book deal one day. Some journalists will tell you what they want to write about, and others will tell you where they want to work. It is the latter, unfortunately, who get most of the jobs. The most esteemed positions in media are often held by people whose greatest talent is \u201cgetting good jobs\u201d. The world is full of excellent writers and reporters who are barely getting by, because they make the mistake of pouring their efforts into stories rather than into career-building. A less self-pitying way to say this is: there are scores of people capable of filling every decent job in journalism. The New York Times could turn over its entire staff 20 times without suffering a loss in quality. This means, in fairness, that we should hold the work of the people at the top of the profession to high standards, because there are a hundred writers standing behind them who could do their jobs just as well. Everyone who has been around for a while has come to understand this. It is what drives the white-hot anger at every half-assed Ivy Leaguer who lands a plum columnist job.</p> <p>The rage of the creative underclass burns brightly just below the surface of the media. That is why the most meaningful legacy that Gawker left behind may not be any of its big scoops, but rather its role in setting off the wave of unionization that is still sweeping through America\u2019s newsrooms to this day. Unions took off in media because journalists have, if nothing else, enough common sense to see that the people in charge make more money and have more power but are clearly not any smarter than us.

Endless column inches have also been devoted to the eccentricities and extremist ideas of his top lieutenants, including the foreign minister who insists climate change is a Marxist plot and the education minister who enjoys tweeting about his dog\u2019s habit of defecating on Brazil\u2019s top newspapers. But the lower ranks of Brazil\u2019s government apparatus are also being populated with less well-known characters who trumpet white supremacist slogans and rage against the left. \u201cSay whatever you like about Bolsonaro, one has to recognize his rare talent of \u2026 choosing the most unqualified, lunatic and/or dangerous people for jobs,\u201d the journalist Mauro Ventura wrote earlier this month. \u201cAs someone said, they seem to have been picked for their IQ: that\u2019s to say their quotient of imbecility, inability, idiocy, incompetence, ineptitude or impiety.\u201d Brazil specialist Monica de Bolle said the hiring of such figures reflected the \u201ctotally nuts\u201d nature of Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cfundamentalist\u201d administration. \u201cThey are not looking for people who have knowledge but people who are loyal,\u201d said De Bolle, from the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cI hate the Trump comparisons because Brazil is Brazil and the US is the US. But it\u2019s just like Trump has surrounded himself with yes men. They are all yes men - and for the most part they are all men.\u201d Here are four Bolsonaro underlings you may never have heard of: Filipe Martins Foreign policy adviser to the president Before this year Martins, 31, had almost no foreign policy experience. Yet his close ties to two of Bolsonaro\u2019s sons have helped transform him into one of Brazil\u2019s most influential men and landed him an office just metres from Bolsonaro\u2019s. Like Bolsonaro\u2019s sons, Martins is a disciple of the US-based writer and conspiracy theorist Olavo de Carvalho and revels in bashing leftists, feminists, \u201cglobalists\u201d and journalists on social media. He is also a Steve Bannon fan, nicknamed \u201cSorocabannon\u201d thanks to his origins in the Brazilian city of Sorocaba and admiration for Trump\u2019s ex-strategist. As with many Bolsonaristas, Martins basks in controversy, using alt-right catchphrases such as \u201cDeus Vult\u201d and General Franco-era slogans to bait critics. After Brazil\u2019s footballers lost to Belgium in the 2018 World Cup, the man who now helps run Brazilian foreign policy branded the European country \u201ca modern-day Babel\u201d. Martins also enjoys conspiracy, last year accusing CNN and the New York Times of complicity in a \u201csocial engineering\u201d campaign to promote paedophilia. Roberto Alvim Special secretary for culture A dramatist by trade, Alvim once received an award for a production of Harold Pinter\u2019s The Room. But before being named culture secretary in November the 46-year-old director was best known for insulting the grande dame of Brazilian theatre, the Oscar-nominated actor Fernanda Montenegro, as a \u201csordid\u201d leftist. That attack enraged Brazilian thespians but earned him Bolsonaro\u2019s affections \u2013 and a job as Brazil\u2019s culture chief. An online biography makes unusual reading. Aged 22, Alvim ditched a budding directing career to undergo \u201ca process of inner discovery through meditation practices\u201d. He ended up in a hut in north-eastern Brazil and depriving himself of food, water and human contact for 21 days. Alvim returned to theatre before reportedly finding God in 2017 after a supposedly miraculous cure for near-fatal cancer. \u201cIt was a direct intervention from our Lord Jesus Christ,\u201d he recently claimed. Alvim has said his newfound faith converted him into a hardcore Bolsonarista. In recent Facebook posts he has savaged his leader\u2019s opponents as lefty \u201ccockroaches\u201d, railed against the \u201cbastards\u201d from Greenpeace and accused Brazil\u2019s \u201crotten\u201d and \u201cdemonic\u201d art world of unfairly demonizing Bolsonaro. S\u00e9rgio Nascimento de Camargo Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Cultural Palmares The man chosen to run the government foundation promoting black culture has called for Brazil\u2019s Black Consciousness Day to be scrapped and has branded many of Brazil\u2019s best-known black celebrities and artists \u201cparasites of the black race\u201d. Most notoriously, he once called one of Brazil\u2019s most celebrated samba composers, Martinho da Vila, a \u201cbum\u201d who should \u201cbe sent to the Congo\u201d.

After public outrage and a legal challenge, Camargo\u2019s appointment was suspended. But Bolsonaro has said he hopes that decision can be overturned, calling Camargo an \u201cexcellent\u201d person. Dante Mantovani Head of the National Arts Foundation The hard-right classical conductor and YouTuber presiding over the government body in charge of policy for visual arts, music and dance has claimed the Soviet Union infiltrated the CIA to distribute LSD at Woodstock. \u201cRock activates drugs which activate sex which activates the abortion industry,\u201d Mantovani alleged, noting that John Lennon had said he made a pact with the devil. Mantovani has said Metallica was good for keeping drivers awake but called Brazilian greats Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil and pop star Anitta \u201caberrations\u201d for depicting Brazil as a \u201ctype of brothel\u201d. Taking office, he claimed Brazil owed its culture to Portugal which \u201ccivilised\u201d rather than \u201ccolonised\u201d his homeland.",

Users can opt for workouts anywhere between 10 and 25 minutes long, and can select sessions based on parts of the body. So far, so normal. But it is the Coach programme that stands out. The personal plans are created by algorithms that pool the data of users with similar stats to chart your journey. Key to this is regular logging; you will record your details when you first start (height, weight, general fitness level) and log after each workout, telling the app how tough you found it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"962c5dae08fbe2d393241678107313589054a75f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/962c5dae08fbe2d393241678107313589054a75f/1320_0_3345_4183/800.jpg\" alt=\"Freeletics fitness app\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freeletics</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Freeletics promises its workouts will be hard, but not so hard that you give up. It is the feedback moments that allow it to alter your plan accordingly, based on the behaviour of other users who had similar experiences. As with a real coach, there are plenty of demo videos and tutorials to guide you through, plus helpful nudges to drink water and sleep well. The Coach can even detect if you are overtraining. Freeletics also has a fairly busy meetup community, providing some of the social elements of exercise that can be lost when training at home. Plus, the exercises don\u2019t require any equipment<br><strong>Worth a download?</strong> Absolutely, if you have some experience of exercising \u2013 it could be a little overwhelming for a total newbie. <em>CK</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://30dayfitness.app/\" title=\"\">30 Day Fitness Challenge</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>Price </strong>Free; from \u00a31.99 a week for the premium version.<br><strong>What is it?</strong> A 30-day programme with levels from beginner to pro.<br><strong>The experience</strong> Month-long challenges have become a staple of modern fitness. This app capitalises on the idea that people can do anything if it is in short bursts, hence the idea of daily sessions for 30 days.<br>Most of the challenges are focused on a specific area \u2013 there is the \u201cflat belly challenge\u201d and the \u201cslim arms challenge\u201d \u2013 but nearly all involve a full-body workout. The video tutorials are clear and there are 400 workouts in the library if you feel like doing something completely different outside of the challenge. The end result should be that your overall fitness is improved.<br><strong>Worth a download?</strong> Absolutely \u2013 30-day challenges may not be for everyone, but, unlike many other apps, there is plenty to do for free. <em>CK</em></p>",

Worth a download? Unless you are a fan of Victoria and her style, I can\u2019t see it delivering enough. CK Freeletics Price \u00a31.78 a week for training; \u00a32.66 including nutrional information. What is it? Touted as a digital personal trainer, this app has a cultish fanbase thanks to its detailed personalised fitness plans. The experience You can join in with the short but intense fitness challenges, or a variety of running, bodyweight or gym workouts. Users can opt for workouts anywhere between 10 and 25 minutes long, and can select sessions based on parts of the body. So far, so normal. But it is the Coach programme that stands out. The personal plans are created by algorithms that pool the data of users with similar stats to chart your journey. Key to this is regular logging; you will record your details when you first start (height, weight, general fitness level) and log after each workout, telling the app how tough you found it. Freeletics promises its workouts will be hard, but not so hard that you give up. It is the feedback moments that allow it to alter your plan accordingly, based on the behaviour of other users who had similar experiences. As with a real coach, there are plenty of demo videos and tutorials to guide you through, plus helpful nudges to drink water and sleep well. The Coach can even detect if you are overtraining. Freeletics also has a fairly busy meetup community, providing some of the social elements of exercise that can be lost when training at home. Plus, the exercises don\u2019t require any equipment Worth a download? Absolutely, if you have some experience of exercising \u2013 it could be a little overwhelming for a total newbie. CK 30 Day Fitness Challenge Price Free; from \u00a31.99 a week for the premium version. What is it? A 30-day programme with levels from beginner to pro. The experience Month-long challenges have become a staple of modern fitness. This app capitalises on the idea that people can do anything if it is in short bursts, hence the idea of daily sessions for 30 days. Most of the challenges are focused on a specific area \u2013 there is the \u201cflat belly challenge\u201d and the \u201cslim arms challenge\u201d \u2013 but nearly all involve a full-body workout. The video tutorials are clear and there are 400 workouts in the library if you feel like doing something completely different outside of the challenge. The end result should be that your overall fitness is improved. Worth a download? Absolutely \u2013 30-day challenges may not be for everyone, but, unlike many other apps, there is plenty to do for free. CK",

From the developers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/11/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-ubisoft\">Assassin\u2019s Creed: Odyssey</a>, it sends the player out to face creatures drawn from the gnarliest Greek legends and rescue the gods. <em>Release date: February (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Project Scarlett, Google Stadia, Nintendo Switch)</em></p> <h2>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a10ab815d5373e3ab61d99c66e9b4e3f0c494b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a10ab815d5373e3ab61d99c66e9b4e3f0c494b8/416_250_2994_1743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ori and the Will of the Wisps.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"582\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spirit \u2026 Ori and the Will of the Wisps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A platform game for anyone who thinks video games are too easy these days, Ori draws its play inspiration from classics such as Mario, Mega Man and Metroid, but its looks are bang up to date. Guiding a spirit through an intensely beautiful forest, you\u2019ll come up against puzzles and obstacles that challenge both your mind and your reflexes. Let\u2019s hope they\u2019re still sharp. <br><em>Release date: 11 February (PC, Xbox One)</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/17/e3-2015-what-final-fantasy-vii-tells-us-about-gamings-obsession-with-its-past\">Final Fantasy VII </a></h2> <p>Originally released in 1997, Final Fantasy VII is one of the most beloved and acclaimed role-playing titles of all time. Under the direction of principal character artist Tetsuya Nomura, the remake is a complete update of the ecologically themed adventure with rebuilt environments and a modern, highly customisable combat system. Expectations are high and early hands-on reports suggest we won\u2019t be disappointed. <em>Release date: 3 March (PS4)</em></p> <h2>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h2> <p>Nintendo\u2019s legendarily adorable time-sink returns \u2013 only this time, instead of starting a new life in a town populated by kooky animals, you\u2019ve got a whole deserted island to shape to your desires, making everything from furniture, houses and signage to neat threads. As ever, the true joy will be found in being invited to other players\u2019 paradises and nicking their fruit trees. <br><em>Release date: 20 March (Nintendo Switch)</em></p> <h2>Doom Eternal</h2> <p>A direct sequel to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/18/doom-review-ludicrous-compelling-shooter-reboot-basics-original\">2016 Doom reboot</a> (which brilliantly updated the classic formula with lashing of gore and incredible turbo-charged pace), Eternal doesn\u2019t mess too much with the format. You\u2019re still the Doom Slayer, charging through a hellish landscape blasting demons with shotguns or dismembering them with chainsaws. This time however, you can dissect your fallen foe to discover new weapons and ammo. <br><em>Release date: 20 March (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Google Stadia, Nintendo Switch)</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/22/valve-reveals-vr-exclusive-game-half-life-alyx\">Half-Life: Alyx</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4dd17187c8ec545d857fce044ed85d14a0ce4e76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dd17187c8ec545d857fce044ed85d14a0ce4e76/80_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"High-wire act \u2026 Half-Life: Alyx.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">High-wire act \u2026 Half-Life: Alyx.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valve Corporation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It might not be the Half-Life sequel that fans have been praying for since Half Life 2: Episode Two, but this VR-exclusive return to the legendary sci-fi shooter series might be as close as we get. Set between Half-Life and Half-Life 2, the action follows resistance leader Alyx Vance as she fights back against the Combine. Designed specifically for virtual reality headsets and motion controllers, this could be a groundbreaking gaming experience. <br><em>Release date: March (PC)</em></p> <h2>Cyberpunk 2077</h2> <p>The latest open-world role-playing adventure from the creators of the Witcher series, Cyberpunk 2077 promises an epic dystopian fantasy filled with prosthetically enhanced hacker gangs, devastating weapons and sprawling neon-lit cityscapes.

Grounded looks characterful, colourful and approachable where survival games are often grim, unforgiving and unwelcoming. <br><em>Release date: spring 2020 (PC, Xbox One)</em></p> <h2>The Last of Us Part II</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/jun/05/the-last-of-us-ps3-video-game-review\">Naughty Dog\u2019s post-apocalyptic adventure</a> ended in a fittingly ambiguous way back in 2013, so the sequel, which takes place five years later, has a lot of work to do. Ellie is now 19 and, although monstrous mutants and deadly cults still roam America, she is living in a seemingly peaceful settlement \u2013 until a tragedy occurs setting off a brutal revenge narrative. Expect violence and emotion in equal measure. <br><em>Release date: 29 May (PS4)</em></p> <h2>Ghost of Tsushima</h2> <p>Not confirmed for 2020 but likely to be a PlayStation 5 launch title, Ghost of Tsushima is an absurdly good-looking samurai game that pays loving tribute to the classic films of the genre. If you\u2019re excited by the idea of tense life-or-death swordfights under falling cherry blossoms, this is one to watch. <br><em>Release date: Summer 2020 (PS4)</em></p> <h2>Tell Me Why</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g4_hHqo8ak\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9g4_hHqo8ak?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Another game about teen emotions from the developers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/26/life-is-strange-episodic-video-game-dontnod\">Life I</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/26/life-is-strange-episodic-video-game-dontnod\">s Strange</a>, Tell Me Why is about a pair of twins, one of whom is a trans man, reckoning with the events of their childhood in small-town Alaska. Their differing recollections of events should introduce interesting narrative tension. <br><em>Release date: mid-2020 (PC, Xbox One)</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/05/overwatch-2-the-long-awaited-sequel-inspired-by-the-avengers\">Overwatch 2</a></h2> <p>Blizzard Entertainment\u2019s bright first-person shooter added much-needed character to the online multiplayer gaming scene \u2013 but offered little in the way of narrative. The sequel brings new characters and maps as well as a full story mode, pitching our heroes against the Null Sector robot army in co-operative quests, while replayable \u201chero missions\u201d allow characters to unlock new items. More of an expansion than a conventional sequel, it promises plenty of fresh challenges. <br><em>Release date: TBC (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch)</em></p> <h2>Minecraft Dungeons</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=076mjMOL6R8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/076mjMOL6R8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A promising spinoff from the multimillion-selling construction game, Minecraft Dungeons puts players into groups of four adventurers raiding stylishly blocky tombs and tunnels to find treasure and kill enemies. There\u2019s no building to do, just lots of traps, puzzles and monsters to contend with and a host of procedurally generated worlds to explore. <br><em>Release date: TBC (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch)</em></p> <h2>Watch Dogs: Legion</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/25/watch-dogs-2-review-hacking-adventure\">innovative open-world adventure</a> returns with another critique on surveillance capitalism, this time set in a London that has become a technologically advanced police state. Players align with local members of the DedSec hacking group, recruiting new activists and striking back against the system.

We\u2019re also promised dozens of licensed aircraft and a modifiable simulation engine that alters the flight difficulty, welcoming both wannabe pilots and players who just want to do a loop-the-loop in a 747. <br><em>Release date: TBC (PC, Xbox One)</em></p> <h2>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</h2> <p>It\u2019s about time someone made a game that truly innovated on the battle royale formula \u2013 and this looks like it. As with Fortnite, 100 players are dropped into the world until only one remains, but there are no guns. Instead participants have to run through a colourful obstacle course crammed with swinging battering rams and giant boulders until someone reaches the finishing post. Like It\u2019s a Knockout for millennials. <br><em>Release date: TBC (PC, PS4)</em></p> <h2>Psychonauts 2</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"349534dca7f6f69c42313d2b1d41f5ab0329569a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/349534dca7f6f69c42313d2b1d41f5ab0329569a/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Psychonauts 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Telekinetic \u2026 Psychonauts 2</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Double Fine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The long-awaited sequel to one of the weirdest, best and most underrated platform games ever made, 2005\u2019s Psychonauts.

      "bodyText": "Gods and Monsters With its painterly, storybook aesthetic and promise of a wide-open hero\u2019s adventure, this mythological Ubisoft adventure will intrigue anyone who\u2019s patiently waiting for a sequel to Zelda: Breath of the Wild. From the developers of Assassin\u2019s Creed: Odyssey, it sends the player out to face creatures drawn from the gnarliest Greek legends and rescue the gods. Release date: February (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Project Scarlett, Google Stadia, Nintendo Switch) Ori and the Will of the Wisps A platform game for anyone who thinks video games are too easy these days, Ori draws its play inspiration from classics such as Mario, Mega Man and Metroid, but its looks are bang up to date. Guiding a spirit through an intensely beautiful forest, you\u2019ll come up against puzzles and obstacles that challenge both your mind and your reflexes. Let\u2019s hope they\u2019re still sharp. Release date: 11 February (PC, Xbox One) Final Fantasy VII Originally released in 1997, Final Fantasy VII is one of the most beloved and acclaimed role-playing titles of all time. Under the direction of principal character artist Tetsuya Nomura, the remake is a complete update of the ecologically themed adventure with rebuilt environments and a modern, highly customisable combat system. Expectations are high and early hands-on reports suggest we won\u2019t be disappointed. Release date: 3 March (PS4) Animal Crossing: New Horizons Nintendo\u2019s legendarily adorable time-sink returns \u2013 only this time, instead of starting a new life in a town populated by kooky animals, you\u2019ve got a whole deserted island to shape to your desires, making everything from furniture, houses and signage to neat threads. As ever, the true joy will be found in being invited to other players\u2019 paradises and nicking their fruit trees. Release date: 20 March (Nintendo Switch) Doom Eternal A direct sequel to the 2016 Doom reboot (which brilliantly updated the classic formula with lashing of gore and incredible turbo-charged pace), Eternal doesn\u2019t mess too much with the format. You\u2019re still the Doom Slayer, charging through a hellish landscape blasting demons with shotguns or dismembering them with chainsaws. This time however, you can dissect your fallen foe to discover new weapons and ammo. Release date: 20 March (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Google Stadia, Nintendo Switch) Half-Life: Alyx It might not be the Half-Life sequel that fans have been praying for since Half Life 2: Episode Two, but this VR-exclusive return to the legendary sci-fi shooter series might be as close as we get. Set between Half-Life and Half-Life 2, the action follows resistance leader Alyx Vance as she fights back against the Combine. Designed specifically for virtual reality headsets and motion controllers, this could be a groundbreaking gaming experience. Release date: March (PC) Cyberpunk 2077 The latest open-world role-playing adventure from the creators of the Witcher series, Cyberpunk 2077 promises an epic dystopian fantasy filled with prosthetically enhanced hacker gangs, devastating weapons and sprawling neon-lit cityscapes. You\u2019re a mercenary on the hunt for a life-extending augmentation, and how you get it is entirely up to you. If that isn\u2019t enough, it stars Keanu Reeves. Release date: 16 April (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Google Stadia) Grounded Think Honey, I Shrunk the Kids as a cooperative survival game, where everyday objects and common bugs are massive and pose a sudden threat to your team of miniaturised kids in a suburban garden. Grounded looks characterful, colourful and approachable where survival games are often grim, unforgiving and unwelcoming. Release date: spring 2020 (PC, Xbox One) The Last of Us Part II Naughty Dog\u2019s post-apocalyptic adventure ended in a fittingly ambiguous way back in 2013, so the sequel, which takes place five years later, has a lot of work to do. Ellie is now 19 and, although monstrous mutants and deadly cults still roam America, she is living in a seemingly peaceful settlement \u2013 until a tragedy occurs setting off a brutal revenge narrative. Expect violence and emotion in equal measure. Release date: 29 May (PS4) Ghost of Tsushima Not confirmed for 2020 but likely to be a PlayStation 5 launch title, Ghost of Tsushima is an absurdly good-looking samurai game that pays loving tribute to the classic films of the genre. If you\u2019re excited by the idea of tense life-or-death swordfights under falling cherry blossoms, this is one to watch. Release date: Summer 2020 (PS4) Tell Me Why Another game about teen emotions from the developers of Life Is Strange, Tell Me Why is about a pair of twins, one of whom is a trans man, reckoning with the events of their childhood in small-town Alaska. Their differing recollections of events should introduce interesting narrative tension. Release date: mid-2020 (PC, Xbox One) Overwatch 2 Blizzard Entertainment\u2019s bright first-person shooter added much-needed character to the online multiplayer gaming scene \u2013 but offered little in the way of narrative. The sequel brings new characters and maps as well as a full story mode, pitching our heroes against the Null Sector robot army in co-operative quests, while replayable \u201chero missions\u201d allow characters to unlock new items. More of an expansion than a conventional sequel, it promises plenty of fresh challenges. Release date: TBC (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch) Minecraft Dungeons A promising spinoff from the multimillion-selling construction game, Minecraft Dungeons puts players into groups of four adventurers raiding stylishly blocky tombs and tunnels to find treasure and kill enemies. There\u2019s no building to do, just lots of traps, puzzles and monsters to contend with and a host of procedurally generated worlds to explore. Release date: TBC (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch) Watch Dogs: Legion The innovative open-world adventure returns with another critique on surveillance capitalism, this time set in a London that has become a technologically advanced police state. Players align with local members of the DedSec hacking group, recruiting new activists and striking back against the system. We\u2019re promised a vast, highly detailed version of the near-future capital and a thrilling resistance narrative. Release date: TBC (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Project Scarlett, Google Stadia) Flight Simulator Microsoft\u2019s landmark sim gets its first major update for a decade and, thanks to modern mapping and cloud-computing technologies, it will apparently recreate the entire planet (including 2 million towns and cities) as well as real-world weather conditions. We\u2019re also promised dozens of licensed aircraft and a modifiable simulation engine that alters the flight difficulty, welcoming both wannabe pilots and players who just want to do a loop-the-loop in a 747. Release date: TBC (PC, Xbox One) Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout It\u2019s about time someone made a game that truly innovated on the battle royale formula \u2013 and this looks like it. As with Fortnite, 100 players are dropped into the world until only one remains, but there are no guns. Instead participants have to run through a colourful obstacle course crammed with swinging battering rams and giant boulders until someone reaches the finishing post. Like It\u2019s a Knockout for millennials. Release date: TBC (PC, PS4) Psychonauts 2 The long-awaited sequel to one of the weirdest, best and most underrated platform games ever made, 2005\u2019s Psychonauts. You\u2019re a strange kid with telekinetic powers, journeying through the minds of other equally odd characters, whose preoccupations and personality flaws are writ large. If Tim Burton made games, they\u2019d look a lot like this. Release date: TBC (PC, PS4, Xbox One) Empire of Sin From veteran video game designers Brenda and John Romero, Empire of Sin is your chance to live the life of a mafia boss in prohibition-era Chicago, recruiting, manipulating and occasionally murdering mobsters to spread your influence (and hooch) across the city.

Set in near-future Seattle, it promises an unforgettably brooding story.

My eyes are shut and I feel as if we are floating.</p> <p>For me, singing like this has become a welcome respite from the noise of the news and other stresses.

Lifetime friendships, jobs, housemates \u2026 it\u2019s pretty much a lifestyle. Our semi-jokey hashtag is #notacult.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ukshapenote.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Sacred Harp singing</a> is also growing in the UK since its arrival in the 1990s. Groups sit in four blocks facing one another, leaving a hollow square in the middle, where people take turns to lead the singing. While it is rooted in religious singing from New England and the southern US, you are not expected to be a believer. Cork hosts the biggest Sacred Harp convention in Europe, with 200 attendees; last year\u2019s UK convention in Bristol was its biggest yet, with 160 attendees from the UK, Ireland, Germany, Norway and the US.</p> <p>Co-organiser Steve Brett points out that Sacred Harp groups are not, technically, choirs \u2013 there is no conductor or director, and they do not perform or practice. \u201cWhen we sing, we\u2019re singing to and for each other,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it\u2019s a bit different. I think the non-performative aspect attracts some people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise sing.</p> <p>\u201cAll four parts are written to be enjoyable to sing. There are fireworks between the parts, because it\u2019s not designed to be listened to, it\u2019s designed to be sung.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0b15ea2540d4e650201fa4c9155bc0cf15871152\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b15ea2540d4e650201fa4c9155bc0cf15871152/0_0_5419_4135/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cafe Oto Experimental choir, with Jennifer Lucy Allan, back row, second from left.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"763\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cafe Oto Experimental choir, with Jennifer Lucy Allan, back row, second from left.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like others I speak to, Brett struggles to put into words the feeling he gets from singing in a large group. \u201cIt\u2019s just so powerful,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you get a sense of from listening to a recording. You\u2019re surrounded by loads of people who are also singing in full voice. Singing next to other people like this, you are showing a lot of vulnerability and you tend to form very strong bonds with people very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>If singing together can feel like exposing ourselves, it also generates feelings of trust and togetherness when we take the risk. This is something that is at the core of the <a href=\"https://www.hopegospelchoir.com/about\" title=\"\">Hope Community Gospel choir</a> in Beeston, Nottinghamshire, run by Barbara and Stephen Thomas. They took over the choir in 2014, when they were volunteered for the task by Stephen\u2019s goddaughter. At that point the choir had dwindled to around a dozen people. Now, there are up to 80 at rehearsals. There are no auditions, and although hardly anyone has musical training, Barbara is adamant: \u201cIf you enjoy what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll make a good sound.\u201d</p> <p>The Thomases, who are both social workers, are proud that the choir is a place where anyone, including those with disabilities, can join in. Their youngest member is 23; their oldest is in their 80s. Choir members come from a diverse range of backgrounds, ethnicities and religions. \u201cAll of those tensions or divisions that might have been there, between black and white members, atheist and Christian \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter, because we all go through the same struggles in life,\u201d says Stephen. \u201cThis is a community choir; you have to embrace everyone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ce6996b20de90fad427609dcfa4e289295acfc46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce6996b20de90fad427609dcfa4e289295acfc46/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Sacred Harp singers in Bristol.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sacred Harp singers in Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne Altrinhgam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of their members also come for therapeutic reasons. For a while, a woman brought her husband, who had dementia. He would scream at various intervals, but he loved it, and the group were unfazed by his exclamations. They tell me how it was only after the death of a choir member that they discovered she had been walking long distances to attend. \u201cIt makes it worthwhile when you\u2019re giving back to people who might not shout about their needs,\u201d says Barbara.</p> <p>Lucky Kaur runs drop-in sessions and singing groups in St Austell, in Cornwall. Trained in Indian classical and western choral music, she also trained as a psychotherapist and was a social worker, and initially brought the two parts of her life together in vocal workshops she ran at the town\u2019s soup kitchen. She has since taken this practice into other spaces, where it forms part of rehabilitation programmes, and also runs an open drop-in session. \u201cI live near the sea,\u201d she says, \u201cand this singing is about anchoring people.\u201d</p> <p>At the group she ran at the soup kitchen, she saw that singing was more than just a social activity. \u201cHomeless people often don\u2019t feel they have a voice,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when we got everyone in a circle and made sounds, it became polyphonic and harmonious. We practised using our voices \u2013 how to project your voice, for example \u2013 as in a traditional choir, and I used to keep the front door open, so passersby would hear people singing inside.\u201d</p> <p>Kaur says that many of us don\u2019t know how to use our voices \u2013 whether that is about projecting across a room or just being able to vocalise our needs \u2013 and her sessions build confidence and help singers get to know their voices. Singing like this, she claims, can help us feel as if we can speak up in other parts of our lives.</p> <p>For all of the people running them, a choir is often not just a choir, but also a social club, a community and a charity. For me, it has become a refuge; I can\u2019t check my phone when I am hollering and humming, and holding a note distracts me from the usual clutter of my mind. At the end of a session, as our voices fade to silence and I feel the boards under my feet again, there is a deep silence that descends \u2013 a gleeful peace that fizzes like static in the room. I ask Kaur about this feeling \u2013 is it just me, or does this happen in other groups she runs? \u201cOh yes,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that. I\u2019ve seen tears; I\u2019ve seen big smiles \u2026 There is a wonderment on people\u2019s faces. It\u2019s just beautiful. Absolutely exquisite. I think it\u2019s out of this world.\u201d</p>",

Co-organiser Steve Brett points out that Sacred Harp groups are not, technically, choirs \u2013 there is no conductor or director, and they do not perform or practice. \u201cWhen we sing, we\u2019re singing to and for each other,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it\u2019s a bit different. I think the non-performative aspect attracts some people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise sing. \u201cAll four parts are written to be enjoyable to sing. There are fireworks between the parts, because it\u2019s not designed to be listened to, it\u2019s designed to be sung.\u201d Like others I speak to, Brett struggles to put into words the feeling he gets from singing in a large group. \u201cIt\u2019s just so powerful,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you get a sense of from listening to a recording. You\u2019re surrounded by loads of people who are also singing in full voice. Singing next to other people like this, you are showing a lot of vulnerability and you tend to form very strong bonds with people very quickly.\u201d If singing together can feel like exposing ourselves, it also generates feelings of trust and togetherness when we take the risk. This is something that is at the core of the Hope Community Gospel choir in Beeston, Nottinghamshire, run by Barbara and Stephen Thomas. They took over the choir in 2014, when they were volunteered for the task by Stephen\u2019s goddaughter. At that point the choir had dwindled to around a dozen people. Now, there are up to 80 at rehearsals. There are no auditions, and although hardly anyone has musical training, Barbara is adamant: \u201cIf you enjoy what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll make a good sound.\u201d The Thomases, who are both social workers, are proud that the choir is a place where anyone, including those with disabilities, can join in. Their youngest member is 23; their oldest is in their 80s. Choir members come from a diverse range of backgrounds, ethnicities and religions. \u201cAll of those tensions or divisions that might have been there, between black and white members, atheist and Christian \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter, because we all go through the same struggles in life,\u201d says Stephen. \u201cThis is a community choir; you have to embrace everyone.\u201d Some of their members also come for therapeutic reasons. For a while, a woman brought her husband, who had dementia. He would scream at various intervals, but he loved it, and the group were unfazed by his exclamations. They tell me how it was only after the death of a choir member that they discovered she had been walking long distances to attend. \u201cIt makes it worthwhile when you\u2019re giving back to people who might not shout about their needs,\u201d says Barbara. Lucky Kaur runs drop-in sessions and singing groups in St Austell, in Cornwall. Trained in Indian classical and western choral music, she also trained as a psychotherapist and was a social worker, and initially brought the two parts of her life together in vocal workshops she ran at the town\u2019s soup kitchen. She has since taken this practice into other spaces, where it forms part of rehabilitation programmes, and also runs an open drop-in session. \u201cI live near the sea,\u201d she says, \u201cand this singing is about anchoring people.\u201d At the group she ran at the soup kitchen, she saw that singing was more than just a social activity. \u201cHomeless people often don\u2019t feel they have a voice,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when we got everyone in a circle and made sounds, it became polyphonic and harmonious. We practised using our voices \u2013 how to project your voice, for example \u2013 as in a traditional choir, and I used to keep the front door open, so passersby would hear people singing inside.\u201d Kaur says that many of us don\u2019t know how to use our voices \u2013 whether that is about projecting across a room or just being able to vocalise our needs \u2013 and her sessions build confidence and help singers get to know their voices. Singing like this, she claims, can help us feel as if we can speak up in other parts of our lives. For all of the people running them, a choir is often not just a choir, but also a social club, a community and a charity. For me, it has become a refuge; I can\u2019t check my phone when I am hollering and humming, and holding a note distracts me from the usual clutter of my mind. At the end of a session, as our voices fade to silence and I feel the boards under my feet again, there is a deep silence that descends \u2013 a gleeful peace that fizzes like static in the room. I ask Kaur about this feeling \u2013 is it just me, or does this happen in other groups she runs? \u201cOh yes,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that. I\u2019ve seen tears; I\u2019ve seen big smiles \u2026 There is a wonderment on people\u2019s faces. It\u2019s just beautiful. Absolutely exquisite. I think it\u2019s out of this world.\u201d",

<p>In November significant electronic voting equipment problems occurred in an election in the vital battleground state of Pennsylvania, sparking a lawsuit by advocacy groups charging the state is using insecure electronic voting machines.</p> <p>Other key states like Florida and North Carolina which experienced voting problems in 2016 and Georgia which had serious equipment problems in 2018, are being urged to take precautions to curb new difficulties in 2020, say election analysts.</p> <p>The Brennan Center\u2019s electoral reform program last month<strong> </strong>released a study that stressed testing backup systems and electronic voting equipment before the primaries and next November\u2019s general election was needed to reduce risks of cyber attacks and equipment failures, and offered guidance about ways to recover from attacks or malfunctions.</p> <p>In response to these and other threats, Congress in December added $425m for election-related spending, including security measures, to a massive $1.4tn spending bill for 2020.</p> <p>But Democratic senators such as Mark Warner and Ron Wyden, who backed other election security bills that passed the House but were blocked by Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, still see the need for more election security measures next year, including permanent security funding and other steps to ensure safe elections.</p> <p>In advocating for more funding and legislation, Warner and other election security specialists cite intelligence warnings that the Kremlin will try to disrupt the election in 2020, as it did in 2016 when cyber attacks and social media campaigns sowed dissension and helped Donald Trump become president.</p> <p>\u201cThe intelligence community has warned us that Russia will try again in 2020, and we have to be prepared,\u201d Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cAfter months of pressure, Republican leaders in Congress have finally acknowledged that states need more resources to combat this threat \u2013 but additional money is no substitute for a permanent funding mechanism for securing and maintaining elections systems, and comprehensive legislation to protect our elections \u2013 both of which the White House and GOP leadership have been blocking for two years now,\u201d Warner added.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Russia, China, Iran, and other foreign malicious actors all will seek to interfere in the voting process</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Warner\u2019s concerns were underscored in November when seven top agency officials, including the heads of the FBI and CIA, issued a joint statement predicting Russia, and other countries intend to meddle in the 2020 elections via cyber attacks or social media.</p> <p>\u201cRussia, China, Iran, and other foreign malicious actors all will seek to interfere in the voting process or influence voter perceptions,\u201d the joint statement said.</p> <p>The threat of more cyber attacks, plus disinformation and social media operations to sway public opinion, has prompted the federal government to work closely with officials in all 50 states, the statement said.</p> <p>A Senate intelligence committee report in mid-2019 concluded that Kremlin hackers manipulated election systems in all 50 states, and succeeded in breaching systems in two Florida counties and another state, although vote totals were apparently not affected.</p> <p>Looking ahead at other potential election security problems, Wyden voiced concern that the $425m allocated for 2020 election administration could be used for other purposes than security measures since it was written without tight spending guidelines.</p> <p>\u201cWhile I appreciate the intent, the funding in this spending bill will most likely lead to a massive giveaway to companies that make insecure voting machines,\u201d Wyden told the Guardian. \u201cNot only does this bill let states use federal money to buy insecure machines, it actually says money can go to office chairs, printers or anything related to running an election.\u201d</p> <p>Wyden added: \u201cCongress must pass legislation to secure our entire election system, from voter registration systems and e-poll books, to voting machines and election night reporting websites.\u201d</p> <p>By way of example, Wyden and election security analysts note that e-poll books, which are used in numerous states such as North Carolina

      "bodyText": "Potential electronic voting equipment failures and cyber attacks from Russia and other countries pose persistent threats to the 2020 elections, election security analysts and key Democrats warn. In November significant electronic voting equipment problems occurred in an election in the vital battleground state of Pennsylvania, sparking a lawsuit by advocacy groups charging the state is using insecure electronic voting machines. Other key states like Florida and North Carolina which experienced voting problems in 2016 and Georgia which had serious equipment problems in 2018, are being urged to take precautions to curb new difficulties in 2020, say election analysts. The Brennan Center\u2019s electoral reform program last month released a study that stressed testing backup systems and electronic voting equipment before the primaries and next November\u2019s general election was needed to reduce risks of cyber attacks and equipment failures, and offered guidance about ways to recover from attacks or malfunctions. In response to these and other threats, Congress in December added $425m for election-related spending, including security measures, to a massive $1.4tn spending bill for 2020. But Democratic senators such as Mark Warner and Ron Wyden, who backed other election security bills that passed the House but were blocked by Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, still see the need for more election security measures next year, including permanent security funding and other steps to ensure safe elections. In advocating for more funding and legislation, Warner and other election security specialists cite intelligence warnings that the Kremlin will try to disrupt the election in 2020, as it did in 2016 when cyber attacks and social media campaigns sowed dissension and helped Donald Trump become president. \u201cThe intelligence community has warned us that Russia will try again in 2020, and we have to be prepared,\u201d Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel, told the Guardian. \u201cAfter months of pressure, Republican leaders in Congress have finally acknowledged that states need more resources to combat this threat \u2013 but additional money is no substitute for a permanent funding mechanism for securing and maintaining elections systems, and comprehensive legislation to protect our elections \u2013 both of which the White House and GOP leadership have been blocking for two years now,\u201d Warner added. Warner\u2019s concerns were underscored in November when seven top agency officials, including the heads of the FBI and CIA, issued a joint statement predicting Russia, and other countries intend to meddle in the 2020 elections via cyber attacks or social media. \u201cRussia, China, Iran, and other foreign malicious actors all will seek to interfere in the voting process or influence voter perceptions,\u201d the joint statement said. The threat of more cyber attacks, plus disinformation and social media operations to sway public opinion, has prompted the federal government to work closely with officials in all 50 states, the statement said. A Senate intelligence committee report in mid-2019 concluded that Kremlin hackers manipulated election systems in all 50 states, and succeeded in breaching systems in two Florida counties and another state, although vote totals were apparently not affected. Looking ahead at other potential election security problems, Wyden voiced concern that the $425m allocated for 2020 election administration could be used for other purposes than security measures since it was written without tight spending guidelines. \u201cWhile I appreciate the intent, the funding in this spending bill will most likely lead to a massive giveaway to companies that make insecure voting machines,\u201d Wyden told the Guardian. \u201cNot only does this bill let states use federal money to buy insecure machines, it actually says money can go to office chairs, printers or anything related to running an election.\u201d Wyden added: \u201cCongress must pass legislation to secure our entire election system, from voter registration systems and e-poll books, to voting machines and election night reporting websites.\u201d By way of example, Wyden and election security analysts note that e-poll books, which are used in numerous states such as North Carolina and Georgia to track registered voters and speed up voting, still lack national standards and could be vulnerable to attacks or failures. Likewise, the recent Brennan report cited growing usage of e-poll books as one of several potential trouble spots for the 2020 elections, and suggested that more advance planning is warranted to ensure safe elections in November. The study estimates 41 states will be using e-poll books next November. \u201cI think the period between now and next November is crucial for preparing for potential problems,\u201d said Larry Norden, the director of Brennan\u2019s electoral reform program. Norden cautions e-poll books pose a \u201cnew threat, (since) they\u2019ve become so much more widespread in the last few years.\u201d Similarly, new questions are being raised about the safety of some electronic voting equipment given problems in 2019 and 2018, respectively, in Pennsylvania and Georgia. A lawsuit was filed last month to block Pennsylvania from certifying electronic voting equipment that Philadelphia has purchased, after the same machines encountered significant problems in November in undercounting votes in nearby Northampton County. The equipment was made by Nebraska based ES&amp;S, which boasts about 50% of the national voting machine market and has been cited before for malfunctions. In Georgia in the 2018 elections, for instance, old voting machines made by ES&amp;S were involved in counting votes in a race where reportedly about 80,000 votes were strangely not cast, sparking ongoing litigation. More recently in Georgia tests of new e-poll books in six county elections in November revealed software glitches in a few of the counties, delaying voting and spurring the use of paper records instead to check in voters. In light of the multiple concerns, Norden stressed the primaries next year \u201cshould be watched carefully so we can learn from any problems during them. They should be used as an opportunity to be better prepared in November.\u201d Norden added that \u201cThis is probably going to be the highest turnout election in most people\u2019s lives which adds to the complexity,\u201d of protecting election security.",

Authorities are preparing for catastrophic conditions in NSW again on Saturday The NSW government declared its third state of emergency, beginning on Saturday and running for seven days The ACT has declared a state of alert There are 17 people unaccounted for in Victoria, and one in NSW Across Australian 17 people have died and more than 1,400 homes have been destroyed in bushfires since October There are extraordinary delays and traffic jams on the roads out of South Coast regions, after authorities told all tourists and some residents to leave areas today and tomorrow There are now four leave zones for tourists and/or residents in Snowy Monaro, Shoalhaven, Batlow/Wondalga, and South coast Evacuation orders were made for Kosciusko National Park, where the Dunns Road fire is taking hold Exits were hampered by high crowds, road closures, and fuel shortages Some service station ran out, while others limited people to 50L Victorian authorities also urged people to leave the alpine and East Gippsland regions before the weekend There is a total fire ban for NSW on Friday and Saturday HMAS Choules has arrived offshore at Mallacoota, where residents were told they can choose to evacuate The Navy ship can take 500-1,000 people, but they will have to climb up a rope ladder to get aboard Limited evacuations by air will be organised for elderly and infirm people The conditions are predicted to be extreme in South Australia on Friday, with temperatures in Adelaide of 42C and 45C in the regions Fire chief Mark Jones said the concern was already existing fires. \u201cThere are millions of sparks out there ready to go tomorrow if they break containment lines.\u201d The prime minister attended the funeral of firefighter Geoffrey Keaton, who died in December while fighting the Green Wattle Creek blaze Morrison has continued to emphasise the state\u2019s responsibility for disaster response, as he continues to face criticism over the government\u2019s inadequate climate policy, and accusations of a lack of leadership More $21m in commonwealth disaster payments has been paid to fire victims in NSW The WA fire in Dundas has been downgrade to a Watch and Act. I\u2019ve just spoken with Brendan, a Mallacoota resident who has been tweeting updates from the town over the past few days. He\u2019s lived in the East Gippsland town for six months, following his sister who moved their five years ago, and their parents who have lived there for a decade. The families decided to stay, and to defend his sister\u2019s house. Brendan\u2019s house is in town, and his parents live further out in a heavily wooded area. They decided his sister\u2019s place was the most defendable should the fire come through. \u201cIt got pretty intense towards the end. Our plans were to be prepared to fight the embers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was flame just one house away really. We got CFA support at the very last second. But had we not held it back we would have run downstairs and huddled in the corner for the front to pass.\u201d The family have pooled their resources and won\u2019t be evacuating. At a community briefing this afternoon, people were told that the elderly and infirm would be evacuated by air if they wanted to to leave. Everyone else who was willing and able to go would be taken out on HMAS Choules, in groups of about 500 to 1000 people, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cruise ship, it\u2019s a navy ship, they\u2019re not guaranteed a bed. They have to climb aboard by a rope.\u201d He said the mood inside the packed community hall was one of concern, but people were happy the government was doing something to help them. \u201cThere were a lot of visitors here who were not prepared for [the fire],\u201d he said. \u201cThe locals here have been expecting it for quite a while. I mean, you never fully comprehend it but they know we were due for a bushfire.\u201d I asked him what he thinks the future of the town will be. \u201cThis is a difficult question to answer. We chose to live here for good reason. It\u2019s a fantastic part of the world. The infrastructure... has been saved by the CFA. The cafe is intact. The school is mostly intact. It means we have a good chance to have a working community. We think about 20% of the towns buildings were destroyed, so there are a lot of displaced long term residents, and we don\u2019t know how many will rebuild.\u201d The Bermagui and Eden evacuation centres have been closed, as authorities say they can\u2019t guarantee people\u2019s safety, 10 News is reporting. Instead, people should go to Club Sapphire at Merimbula, or the Bega Showground. Wagga Wagga councillor Vanessa Keenan has been thinking about the deputy PM, Michael McCormack. Here\u2019s a quick news report from Nine about Morrison\u2019s visit to firegrounds today (and the press conference earlier). This report from AAP has more details on the road chaos and related details. Fuel shortages and long queues are hampering efforts to escape NSW and Victorian bushfire-hit areas. Victorian authorities have urged tourists and locals to leave the state\u2019s alpine and East Gippsland regions on Thursday. In NSW, people near Batlow have been asked to leave on Thursday while holidaymakers in the alps and between Nowra and the Victorian border should be out by Friday afternoon. While supplies are high in most communities, fuel has been restricted at some sites to guarantee that enough remains for firefighters. Restocking tanks is also an issue, with emergency services due to escort petrol tankers into Moruya on Thursday night. A 50-litre limit per person was imposed at one Moruya petrol station when it faced running dry within hours with a line stretching more than a kilometre. Drivers had already bought 55,000 litres in half a day of trade \u2013 double January\u2019s daily average. Further south, some sites at Merimbula, Bairnsdale and Lakes Entrance have run out of either petrol or diesel. Deliveries have been made to key centres Batemans Bay and Eden, where demand remains high. Caltex said it was doing what it could to deliver more fuel to bushfire-affected areas. \u201cWe thank our customers for their patience as we manage the increased demand at this difficult time,\u201d Caltex spokesman Richard Baker said in a statement. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian on Thursday said she was relieved some towns had power and other services restored. \u201cWe encourage people to exercise caution [driving out],\u201d she told reporters on Thursday. \u201cWe do appreciate that for some, it is difficult to access supplies but it\u2019s much easier than what it was yesterday and the day before.\u201d Just in from the RFS, there is a total fire ban for the next two days. Commencing at midnight tonight, it covers all NSW local government areas. No fires may be lit in the open and all fire permits are suspended during a total fire ban. The NSW RFS has just issued its fourth leave zone declaration, this time for the Snowy Monaro region. These declarations are directed towards tourists and/or residents in the areas to say they need to leave before Saturday. Keep in mind the road chaos at the moment, and exercise some patience \u2013 the NSW police said conditions are continuously changing and sections of roads closing and opening periodically as the fire emergency continues. The four zones are: Snowy Monaro: tourist leave zone Shoalhaven: leave zone Batlow/Wondalga: leave zone South coast: tourist leave zone A quick roundup of the most serious fires across the states. In NSW there are no emergency level fires, just three watch and acts. But there are serious concerns over the Dunns Road fire, which has prompted the evacuation of Kosciuszko national park. In Victoria there are 11 watch and act warnings for fires, predominately in the East Gippsland region. In South Australia there is one watch and act on Kangaroo Island \u2013 that\u2019s the Ravine fire. In Western Australia there is one emergency warning for a fire at the Balladonia roadhouse in Dundas. That fire is threatening lives and homes. In Tasmania there are six watch and act warnings issued for fires near Hobart and in the north-east. Good afternoon everyone. Helen here to take you through the evening. The pressing concern at the moment is traffic. Thousands of people have taken to the roads, ordered to get out of the south coast regions before Saturday. But it\u2019s gridlock with road closures, grass fires and other delays. We are getting reports and seeing vision of cars at standstill, with the main pinchpoints seeming to be at Ulladulla to the north and Cooma to the south-west. If you are there and know more, please get in touch. I am going to hand you over to Helen Davidson for the remainder of the evening. I\u2019ll be back with my colleagues tomorrow \u2013 take care of you. FFS. NSW police media have just released this statement: A man will face court today charged after a fire was allegedly deliberately lit in Sydney\u2019s east yesterday. About 3.30pm (Wednesday 1 January 2020), police were called to a small park in Cox Avenue, Bondi Beach, following reports of a small fire after a brown paper bag filled with dried leaves had allegedly been deliberately lit. Officers from Eastern Suburbs Police Area Command attended and were approached by members of the public, who had extinguished the fire and followed a man leaving the scene. Police spoke with the 34-year-old man before searching him and seizing a cigarette lighter. He was taken to Waverley police station and charged with intentionally cause fire and be reckless to its spread. The Bondi man was refused bail to appear at Parramatta bail court today. Our neighbour, Indonesia, is experiencing its worse flooding in a decade as Australia burns. A bushfire emergency has been declared for the outskirts of Hobart. You can follow along here. Lives and homes are in danger. The air quality in Canberra is slowly shutting down businesses And meanwhile Fuel scarcity remains another big issue for those trying to get through. Phil Coorey: That is what I am worried about. It is petrol. I just pulled into a petrol station to see them and let them know if anyone is planning on leaving, and a tanker came through and filled them up, so there is one pump I think between Cooma and Bega. I am hoping to God all those people have full tanks. But there are families, boats, it is a nightmare. It is not good. I do hope they\u2019ll get through tonight. Coorey says a lack of information is one of the biggest problems: Trying to get information, reliable information. There are a lot of rumours. A couple of days ago I heard another town 15km [away] had been burnt out. I just drove through it and it was fine. And someone said they had turned the water off, but they haven\u2019t. The phones went down, the power went out, those sorts of things. You are sitting in a blackout, and ironically, it is a relative back in Canberra and Sydney \u2013 it looks a lot worse to them. Phil Coorey says the smoke has followed him the entire trip: It is completely shrouded in smoke. The whole Snowy Mountains Highway, probably about 200, 300m. At ground level, you are not just sitting in traffic with your engine running and no petrol stations on that trip, but the smoke is thick. The town was burning about three days ago, they just opened the road in the last couple of days to get people out. There is no fire there today. You hope to God nothing happens in the next 12 hours until they get people out of there. If I was leaving the south coast, I would leave it till very late tonight or first thing tomorrow morning before dawn. If you go now, you will go into the back of a big mess. The Australian Financial Review political editor Phil Coorey is speaking to the ABC about what is happening in the south coast as people attempt to evacuate. As I was going from Cooma to Bega, they have told everyone to get out, get out of the south coast, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be a deal of organisation. There are a great deal of towns, I measured my odometer as I drove the other way. 25km long. That was an hour ago. There was hundreds of thousands of cars as I got past the tailback coming the other way already to add to it. They are towing boats, and I have no idea how anyone in these little towns, getting traffic through, I stopped at an RFS checkpoint and told them and they said they were aware of it, the police are too stretched. I did hear the prime minister on the radio talking about getting the military out, but I didn\u2019t see anyone. I saw one police car the entire trip. I think people are going to be stuck on the mountain all night tonight trying to get home. It strikes me as crazy. You tell an entire coastline to evacuate by one mountain road with next to zero traffic management. This has just come through. Mike Kelly has just had a chat to us to update us on what is happening in his electorate. Evacuations through the electorate of Monaro are just continuing through the Brown Mountain route - which Kelly says is the only one open. He says he has been looking at the possibility of setting up an evacuation centre in the ACT or Queanbeyan given that Bega is getting over run. He is looking at stop over capacity for those trying to get through to Victoria - maybe the Queanbeyan showgrounds. \u201cHopefully what we can do is just keep people moving, because the air quality is appalling at the moment, this is not just a great place for stopping people over.\u201d For residents left in those towns, the advice is still to get to the bigger centres and follow directions. ACT chief minister Andrew Barr has cut his holiday short and is on his way back to the territory, given the warnings for Saturday. He should be back tomorrow afternoon. It hasn\u2019t got as much attention, but South Australia is also still suffering. Many other roads remain closed including: South of Nowra \u2022 Jerrawangala to Tomerong: Turpentine Road is closed \u2022 Wandandian: Wandean Road is closed between the Princes Highway and Bollerang Road \u2022 Nowra Hill to Charleyong: Braidwood Road/Nerriga Road is closed Around Braidwood \u2022 Braidwood to Nelligen: the Kings Highway is closed \u2022 Braidwood to Moruya: Araluen Road is closed \u2022 Braidwood to Cooma: Cooma Road is closed In and around the Snowy Mountains \u2022 Tumut to Adaminaby: the Snowy Mountains Highway is closed \u2022 Batlow to Tumbarumba: Batlow Road is closed \u2022 Jindabyne to Khancoban: Alpine Way is closed A number of smaller local roads are also closed in the south coast and Snowy Mountains areas, and many roads crossing the NSW-Victorian border are also closed, including the Monaro Highway between Rockton and Cann River (Victoria). Up-to-the-minute information about road closures is available at livetraffic.com. The Princes Highway remains open in the following locations: \u2022 Between Tomerong and Nowra \u2022 Between Moruya and Narrabarba (south of Eden) The Snowy Mountains Highway is open at Bega so anyone on the far south coast can travel to Canberra or Sydney via the Snowy Mountains Highway to Cooma, the Monaro Highway to Canberra and the Hume Highway. Motorists are advised to allow plenty of extra travel time as traffic on the Snowy Mountains Highway is very heavy. Motorists in these areas are advised to exercise extreme caution, follow the directions of emergency services and traffic crews and drive with headlights switched on due to smoke in the area. We have a road closure update for you, for those in NSW: The Transport Management Centre is currently advising (current as at 3.45pm): The Princes Highway is now closed between Milton and Tomerong due to a bushfire. \u2022 Motorists heading north from areas between Batemans Bay and Milton are advised to delay their trip, as the road is expected to remain closed for several hours due to fire activity. \u2022 Motorists already on the highway are advised to stop in Milton or Ulladulla. \u2022 There is very heavy northbound traffic on the Princes Highway heading towards Milton. The Princes Highway is also closed in the following locations: \u2022 Between Batemans Bay and Moruya \u2022 Between Narrabarba (south of Eden) and Cann River (Victoria) From Narrabarba, you can travel west on Imlay Road to the Monaro Highway to head north. Josh Frydenberg said Scott Morrison will tour the Victorian fires in \u201cthe coming days\u201d. The treasurer has also defended the prime minister\u2019s response so far: Well, I understand he will be in Victoria shortly. And he\u2019s been in other affected areas. And he\u2019s called a meeting of the national security committee of cabinet of which I\u2019m a member on Monday and will be going through further steps. But he\u2019s in constant contact with his colleagues, with state premiers, getting briefings from emergency management Australia, as well as he indicated today the CDF. On the cost of the disaster, Josh Frydenberg says it is too early to tell. But that is not our primary concern. Our primary concern is not about the financial cost. It\u2019s about the human cost of these tragic fires. So we are working, the ADF, Emergency Australia, upstairs you have the NBN Co that\u2019s helping to get telecommunication networks up and running. You have the Australian Energy Market Operator that is working with other organisations to ensure the energy grid stays stable and support can get to those who need it. The Bureau of Meteorology are here. Working with our state counterparts to ensure that people get the support that they need. Josh Frydenberg is holding a press conference. He has just been given an update on the Victorian situation and seems visibly shaken. He is also asked about the Morrison government\u2019s climate change policies: Our focus is on meeting our Paris commitments. And that is a 28% reduction by 2030 on 2005 levels. And just as we beat our first Kyoto target and on track to beat our 2020 target, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll beat our 2030 target. Climate change is real. I\u2019m not disputing the science. What we are focused on is the most effective way for Australia to meet its international obligations, recognising that we are, as a planet, seeing climate change and we to be part of the global solution which we are. We will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure there is a smooth transition across the economy. But in the most cost-effective way. As the PM has underlined, it\u2019s all about doing so in a responsible way that ensures our economy and our environment continue to get the best possible outcomes. Scott Morrison is in Merimbula, touring the bushfire devastation. The bushfires are also causing chaos between Western Australia and South Australia. As the ABC Goldfields reports: The historic mining town of Norseman has been cut off for extended periods over the past fortnight, with about 270,000 hectares destroyed by seven separate fire fronts in the WA Goldfields region. The Caiguna Roadhouse, 400km east of Norseman along the Eyre Highway, has become the temporary home for about 250 truck drivers and holidaymakers stranded by the out-of-control bushfires. An ADF liaison officer has been sent to the ACT in case things change suddenly. There is an ADF liaison officer in every fire command centre in NSW and Victoria. The state of alert for the ACT is because of the severe weather conditions which are going to hit the wider Canberra area. We\u2019ve decided to take this action, a state of alert, in the ACT as a formal precaution to ensure that we can alert Canberrans about the risk that\u2019s occurring for the ACT into this near future. We see Saturday as a severe fire rating day. Winds will change. It will be incredibly hot on the day. And we don\u2019t see any rain before Saturday evening to ease conditions across the ACT. So it\u2019s an important statement to make to urge Canberrans to be prepared, to ensure that you download your bushfire plan from the ESA website, talk to your family about whether you might need to evacuate at some point, and take some action in regard to that. The ACT government is not declaring a state of emergency just yet \u2013 but it is declaring a state of alert, which is the step beforehand. That\u2019s because of the conditions the ACT will be facing on Saturday. So far the fires have not hit the ACT directly, but it is butting against the ACT and it wouldn\u2019t take much for that to change. The NSW state of emergency starts tomorrow and will last for a week. The main power that will come into play is the power authorities have to forcibly evacuate people. So what can we take from that? Tomorrow is not going to be great, but Saturday is going to be even worse - potentially even worse than what we saw on New Year\u2019s Eve. The Shoalhaven is an area of particular concern. But looking at the map, there is fire stretching from the Victorian border to just outside Sydney. That is a lot of area to cover and a lot of challenges for fire authorities as conditions get even worse. The Victorian fires are also worrying the NSW RFS. There are a number of fires burning south of the border. Obviously the one fire that we had over near Jingellic, east of Albury there, that fire has burnt extensively down in a south-easterly direction towards Victoria, that\u2019s posing a huge threat to the high country areas. We\u2019re working closely with our Victorian colleagues for the fire behaviour and movement as to the south-east corner of our state and the north-east corner of Victoria. We\u2019re working very closely together with that. On how the evacuations are going today, Gladys Berejiklian says things are going as well as can be expected: I want to reiterate that patience, whether it\u2019s local or tourists wanting to get back home, the patience and neighbourly support has been amazing. I want to thank everybody for that. I\u2019m relieved to note the power shortages experienced on New Year\u2019s Day are still there but not as severe as they were. Many people have had power restored. That means people can take safe refuge with friends and relatives and people can access those basic supplies they weren\u2019t able to do so a few days earlier. I also saw, having travelled on and in the vicinity of local roads, the danger that trees, that burnt-out trees are posing, burnt-out telegraph poles are opposing. I saw for myself things that were literally swaying and ready to come down, we need to make sure that nobody is injured, or worse, because of things coming down when they\u2019re using roads. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for us to be cautious and to be safe. We know that can result in frustration for people but I\u2019d much rather have people frustrated and get home safely than not feel frustrate and have themselves or a loved one experience a serious injury or worse. That\u2019s why we need to be cautious at these times. I want to thank in particular police, fire rescue personnel who have made sure that where people can have access to main roads, that they can let them through even monitoring them closely, with only letting a few cars through at a time. We encourage people to exercise caution. We do appreciate that for some, it is difficult to access supplies but it\u2019s much easier than what it was yesterday and the day before. Where are fire authorties worried about? Pretty much everywhere at this point. Shane Fitzsimmons: We are focusing very much on south-eastern quadrant of NSW but not at the exclusion of all these other fires we have across the state. We still have 113 fires burning across NSW. We have a large fire up near the Kurrajong Heights area. Crews have been working on that all day and are gaining the upper hand. That containment will be tenuous as they head into the weekend. They\u2019ll continue strengthening that containment. The last thing we want is an outbreak of that fire complex and heading into communities like the Blue Mountains or into the Kurrajong region and into north-western Sydney, for example. We have the fire around the Green Wattle Creek fire where it\u2019s burning effectively north of Mittagong and burning up to Wombeyancaves. There is a fire burning on the western side of Warragamba dam there. They will continue to fight that fire while favourable weather conditions present. But fighting that fire will be tenuous at best. ... The greater Sydney environment, Illawarra, Shoalhaven and even potential into the Greater Hunter, we have a very large area that will see potentially high level fire danger ratings set in across NSW. The RFS commissioner continues: So we\u2019re going to have a very long, difficult day of hot, dry winds, dominating out of the north, north-west before a southerly change emits. Pretty volatile stretch along the coastal stretch like we saw on New Year\u2019s Eve with the wind strengths, gusting particularly 70, 80km/h or more in some parts. It is going to be a very dangerous day. It\u2019s going to be a very difficult day. Which is why we\u2019re ensuring the highest available orders and arrangements, instruments, for the state of New South Wales are in effect. Another precautionary measure we\u2019re taking for the next few days is to ensure there are state wide total fire bans in place for tomorrow and Saturday. That will be reviewed post Saturday depending on how fire reacts and how fire spreads and what sort of damage is occasioned as a result of the fire behaviour on Saturday. Saturday sounds like absolute hell for everyone in the fire zone. Shane Fitzsimmons: We\u2019re expecting temperatures on Saturday into the low- to mid-40s. Very hot, dry air coming out of the centre of Australia which means humidity will be particularly low. The winds will start very much strengthening up from the north, north-west and swinging around more to the west throughout the day and those wind strengths particularly across the ranges will be coming in at 40, 50, 60km/h and gusting at 70km/h. That will result in severe danger ratings, but coming up towards the central ranges some widespread extreme fire danger which is present some real challenges for fire behaviour and fire spread across that landscape. There will be a southerly change moving through the state on Saturday but at this stage it\u2019s not forecast to start moving through the state of New South Wales, the south-east corner of the state down around Eden, for example, it\u2019s not expected to start moving into that area until about 3:00pm in the afternoon, and then it\u2019ll be a fairly slow movement up the coast and probably not hit an area like Sydney until about midnight. Fire authorities are preparing for the worst case scenario on Saturday, after what happened on Tuesday. Last New Year\u2019s Eve, what we identified and the Premier talked about, it was very much that we saw extraordinary fire behaviour with fires, five of them burning at the emergency warning alert level, from about 8:00am or earlier in the morning. Those fires exceeded all the manual predictions and all the computer-based predictions for what was to be the expected fire spread. As we do routinely, we\u2019ve re-run a number of those models and forecasts and those fires have spread at the absolute worst-case scenario which typically is not what happens when it plays out on the ground. We are applying that technology given the conditions on Saturday are likely to be experienced will be worse than New Year\u2019s Eve and a lot of those areas in the south-east quad rant of the state have the potential to be impacted and impacted very heavily with the conditions forecast for Saturday. Shane Fitzsimmons talks about Friday: Tomorrow we\u2019ll be pushing out more information out tomorrow and today into Shoalhaven, as the fire spreads into the east into more populated areas. Most importantly, given the latest forecasts for the weather conditions on Saturday, the risk areas will extend not just for the far south coast and the Shoalhaven but right across the west, across the high country and out to the southern slopes, the areas west of the high country into places like Tumbarumba and Batlow. There\u2019ll be specific advice out about the community of Batlow and surrounds. Effectively from there, down to Thredbo, Perisher, Jindabyne, there\u2019ll be real challenges and very real risks associated with what\u2019s being forecast and predicted for fire spread under the sorts of weather conditions we\u2019re expecting as we head into Saturday. NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons, who is continuing to show just absolute outstanding leadership, says the state of emergency is necessary. Unfortunately we\u2019ve seen this afternoon fire activity flare up in the Shoalhaven area which has impacted the Princes Highway again, near the Sussex Inlet Road and Bendalong Road area. There is a bit of fire activity there at the moment which we\u2019re hoping to have wrapped up in the next few hours to again provide clear passage to that part of the road. We\u2019re all appreciative collectively of the decisions and patience taken by people down the south coast. We are hoping to clear the disruption to the Princes Highway over the coming hours. So please be patient. And working with police, particularly, and the RMS when it is safe to do so. It is heavily clogged with smoke and fire is burning on the edge of the road and there is backburning operations going on right on the edge of the road as we speak. This is not about waiting to clear the road and make it safe from trees and power poles. This is about active fire that is coming back in on the Princes Highway. As soon as we have that under control, it is a stretch of only about 6km or 7km but it is just a risk that\u2019s too great to allow cars to be traversing that part of the road. The warning, the alert and the messaging to go out and ask people not to be in these at-risk areas is to extend beyond the far south coast. At the moment we\u2019re talking from Batemans Bay down to the Victorian border. Gladys Berejiklian is holding a press conference \u2013 authorities will have the power to forcibly evacuate people, given the conditions which are predicted for Saturday. The reason the why we\u2019re doing it tomorrow ahead of Saturday is to make sure that Commissioner Fitzsimmons and all our personnel, all our agencies know that from tomorrow they will be subject to forced evacuations, road closures, road openings and anything else we need to do as a state to keep our residents and to keep property safe. We don\u2019t take these decisions lightly but we also want to make sure we\u2019re taking every single precaution to be prepared for what could be a horrible day on Saturday. We know temperatures will be in the mid-40s in parts of the state. We also know that there are a lot of tourists on the move and allowing us to declare the state of emergency from tomorrow morning will allow us to ensure that we can provide safe access to roads when we need to, we can also provide safe access provide safe access to roads when we need to, we can also provide safe access to and from destinations as we have been encouraging people to move back home, to travel safely ahead of what will been very difficult circumstances on Saturday. Again, we don\u2019t take these decisions lightly. Cool beans. Quick update on the Woolworths stores in the south coast. Narooma and Bermagui stores are closed, but all others are still open. Eftpos is down in the Batemans Bay store, so you will need cash for that. Stock is said to be good, although the highway closure between Ulladulla and Nowra could impact some stores, as trucks are unable to replenish supplies, but that is being closely monitored. Woolworths is also working with the Salvation Army to supply the evacuations centres \u2013 two trucks are on their way to the region just for that. From a spokesperson: We understand it\u2019s an anxious time and thank customers for their patience as we manage the increased demand and the road closures. We\u2019d also like to thank our team for their continued support in keeping stores operating and for their ongoing help in supporting their local community. We\u2019re also working closely with our partner the Salvation Army, with two truckloads of essential supplies currently being loaded to head to the evacuation centres they are managing in the regions. It is small fry given what else is going on, but the air quality in Canberra continues to be hazardous. Masks and air purifiers are sold out, with retailers unable to tell people when new stock will come in. Travellers have been urged to avoid the Eyre Highway, the main road from the east coast to Western Australia, which has been closed due to bushfires since Christmas and is not expected to open until next week. All four roads into the WA town of Norseman have been cut off by bushfire since Christmas Day, and the fire danger rating for the region on Thursday is catastrophic. But Dundas shire president Laurene Bonza stressed that they were not as badly affected as communities in the eastern states. \u201cThe whole country is on fire,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster of epic proportions.\u201d Bonza urged people not to attempt to travel on the Eyre Highway, reminding visitors that the names on the map along the Eyre Highway are just roadhouses with limited supplies, not towns that can accommodate a large number of visitors. Maureen O\u2019Halloran is the manager of the Caiguna Roadhouse, which is at the eastern edge of the Eyre Highway roadblock. She told 6PR that 120 people were booked at the roadhouse and sheltering out back, and another 60-70 trucks and cars were parked on the road verge out the front.They are running out of essential supplies. \u201cWe ran out of toilet paper so that\u2019s why they had to come in yesterday, especially for hygienic purposes,\u201d O\u2019Halloran told Perth radio station 6PR on Thursday. \u201cIt is draining our basic supplies because we wouldn\u2019t have this many people using our water. We don\u2019t have rain here so we actually make our water here, so that desalination plant is really really getting smashed at the moment.\u201d This is just so heartbreakingly tragic \u2013 as is all the loss. Massive thanks to Luke for stepping back in there for a bit, you have Amy Remeikis again Brendan, a Mallacoota resident, has been tirelessly tweeting out info from the isolated town the last few days. Trapped residents and visitors have just had a community briefing, after the arrival of defence force personnel this morning. The response is being coordinated by police, supplemented by the CFA and other services. Brendan said there were thousands of people crammed in the community hall, with speakers set up outside for those who couldn\u2019t get in. These are his notes: CFA providing an update on the fire situation. Same info as available on VicEmergency app. Some concern about hot and windy weather changes in the next several days. Mallacoota-Genoa road still blocked with trees. Very dangerous to start clearing now. Will take some time to open. ADF people and aircraft are here. 2 x CFA strike teams still here. Third coming in by water tomorrow. Confirms no active fire fronts nearby but spot fires are still happening. Police back on now. Say road to the tip is clear. Waste collection is a priority. Still working on solving the petrol shortage. Police sergeant reading the emergency information sent to people\u2019s phones. Only Telstra phones are working so many missed it. Emphasising that this is *not* a compulsory evacuation, but optional. Looks like evac by boat will be available for anyone if they want it. Personal belongings on the evac would be limited to carry-on size. Police remaining in town to secure remaining houses and vehicles. Giggles in the hall as the ADF say boarding would have to be by rope ladder hanging over the side of the ship (seriously) followed by angry shushing. Unclear what will happen to people offloaded at the evac destination. Community offering private boats to help load people. ADF day they have it under control. Can load very quickly themselves. Asked private boats to stay out of the way. Evac destination stated to be Western Port but may change. ADF and police are focusing on getting people registered to evac so they can scope the effort. Nothing else to report at this time. Briefing opened by local police senior sergeant but interrupted because speakers outside aren\u2019t working. Evac voyage estimated to be 20hrs travel time. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says 17 people are now unaccounted for across the state as more than 50 fires continue to burn. One person is confirmed dead in Victoria. In NSW, the RFS confirms the number of homes lost since New Year\u2019s Eve now stands at 382. Overall, nearly 1,300 homes have been lost. Authorities in NSW order holidaymakers to evacuate the south coast area. That prompts long lines at local supermarkets and lengthy delays for those looking to refuel their cars, while many communities are still without power. The Kosciuszko national park has been evacuated, as have other nearby smaller communities such as Tumbarumba. Between 3,000 and 4,000 people remain trapped in the town of Mallacoota, on Victoria\u2019s eastern tip. Locals and tourists say food and water is running low, and police boats have been ferrying supplies into the town. HMAS Choules, and another smaller naval boat, have arrived off the coast of Mallacoota. About 500 people will be evacuated by sea tomorrow morning. Late last night, police confirmed a woman feared missing at Conjola Park had been found safe. In total, nine people have died in bushfires across NSW and Victoria. Just to recap a few important points that might have been lost given this latest media briefing in Victoria and Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference in Sydney. My colleague Ben Smee pointed out earlier that police are turning around traffic at Milton, north of Ulladulla in NSW. This effectively cuts the Princes Highway and the key northbound route from the south coast to Sydney, Ben says. We\u2019ve also learned the entire Kosciuszko national park has been evacuated. And as we just heard, HMAS Choules should leave Mallacoota with evacuees tomorrow morning. In the past 24 hours, there have been another 11 new fires, mostly in the Upper Murray area, due to lightning strikes. The isolated communities that are being discussed are in the Ovens Valley and Buckland Valley, we\u2019re told. \u201cThere are some communities and small towns in this area that have one road in and one road out. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to become an isolated community and particularly with the fire in the landscape that we have now, not only do we not want you to be isolated but we don\u2019t want more Victorians to face some of the conditions that people have faced over these last few days in communities.\u201d On the question of those in other isolated communities, authorities say they are working as hard as possible to get people out before Saturday\u2019s predicted extreme fire danger. \u201cThe things that are stopping it are things like the conditions and the fire and the landscape,\u201d an official says. \u201cAs soon as it is humanly possible, we will get those things to those people. I want to assure the community that we are doing everything we can to support you and we will continue to support you.\u201d However, it sounds like there is no guarantee they\u2019ll be able to do this. We\u2019re told that there are still between 3,000-4,000 people at Mallacoota. A reporter asks what the message is to those who will remain in Mallacoota after tomorrow morning. She notes many people will have to stay there. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to get everyone out in one go but we are working as hard as we can with our colleagues from the defence force to extricate those that can be extricated,\u201d the police official says. \u201cWe are working very hard to open the roads as soon as we possibly can because if we can extricate people via road that is a great option for us. That takes time, given the huge area that we are talking about that is either burning or burnt.\u201d The Victoria police official is asked about the confirmed 17 missing people. \u201cI am not in a position to say where those people are missing from because it is a wide range of locations across Gippsland,\u201d he says. \u201cI can confirm that, at this stage, we have 17 unaccounted persons. We have one confirmed deceased. That is a terrible tragedy in itself. We are working as hard as we can to focus our efforts on locating those persons unaccounted for. At the moment we ask the community to consider very carefully that we have going fires, very, very hot fires going in these areas.\u201d ADF brigadier Doug Laidlaw is the commander of the emergency services operations in Victoria. He says two navy vessels have now arrived off the coast of Mallacoota. They are holding a series of community meetings to work through the evacuation plans. That will include working out who wishes to be relocated and how to prioritise them. It\u2019s likely the HMAS Choules will say to Westernport tomorrow morning. A Victoria police official talks about the evacuation efforts in Mallacoota. He says that the focus will be on evacuating people children and the sick and vulnerable. \u201cWe are working very hard across agencies to try to restore some form of communications, we are dropping satellite phones, we are able to vulnerable and isolated communities, we will continue to build efforts around that to reestablish and prioritise those vulnerable communities to start with,\u201d he says. Authorities in Victoria are currently holding a press conference at the State Control Centre. A Victorian emergency services official is addressing the media. She says that in the Alpine and East Gippsland areas authorities want people to get out of the area. There is only a small window of opportunity. \u201cWe want them to leave now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have, in the East Gippsland area, a number of isolated communities. In the alpine area where we have tourists and visitors and people residing, we don\u2019t want those people to become isolated like some of the communities that we have down and East Gippsland. \u201cAgain, I ask, please leave now, while we have this opportunity, the window that we have, and move to areas where it is much safer.\u201d This is Luke Henriques-Gomes again taking over from Amy Remeikis. Thanks for all your great work, Amy. OK, let\u2019s quickly summarise some of the main points of that press conference \u2013 Morrison\u2019s first since 29 December. The National Security Committee of cabinet will meet on Monday Morrison: We are considering every option because we know the fire season still has a long time to run and particularly now as we are calling in more ADF assets to deal with this, what we are constantly doing, as we have been doing for months, is looking at what the contingencies are going forward. Those contingencies are being worked on and the National Security Committee of cabinet will meet on Monday to consider those issues as well as the longer term response and some issues we have identified to consider amongst premiers after the fires. Emissions reduction is now being linked to protecting our environment. Morrison: Let me be clear to the Australian people, our emissions reductions policies, will both protect our environment and seek to reduce the risk and hazard we are seeing today, at the same time, it will seek to make sure the viability of people\u2019s jobs and livelihoods, all around the country. But we are not actually changing any of our policies. Morrison: Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets, emissions reduction under our government is 50 million tons more than the previous government and we want to see them continue for this country and continue to better the achievements we have already made, with measures that achieve that. That is why our policies are being improved, the minister for energy and emissions reduction has already outlined that, he has flagged additional measures, where they can be put in place. ... What we will do is make sure our policies remain sensible, that they don\u2019t move towards either extreme, and stay focused on what Australians need for a vibrant and viable economy, as well as a vibrant and sustainable environment. Getting the balance right is what Australia has always been able to achieve. Land-clearing policy is still something the government is very interested in at a national level (it announced an inquiry into land clearing, a state responsibility, late last year before parliament broke). Morrison: Other issues of how you manage hazard reduction are important, because as you say, the impact, more broadly of climate change on these issues has a pronounced effect on the length of the fire season. That, equally then has a need to address issues around hazard reduction for national parks, dealing with land clearing laws, zoning laws and planning walls around people\u2019s properties and where they can be built in countries like Australia, up and down the coast. That being the case with the climatic effects of what we are seeing, there are many restrictions around those effects that have to be reviewed on the basis of the broader climatic effect we are seeing in this country. It is still not time to panic, because this is a natural disaster and we have seen those before. Morrison: In the midst of the disaster, I understand the anxiety and I understand the fear that is there for many and I understand the frustration but this is a natural disaster. Natural disasters are best dealt with through the methodical, well coordinated response that we are seeing today. There are more resources which can be deployed, but the NSW government has not asked for more ADF assistance in evacuations, because roads are still open. Morrison: What we won\u2019t allow to happen is for governments to be tripping over each other in order to somehow outbid each other in the response. What is needed is the coordinated response that these agencies planned for in circumstances like this. Keep calm and stay patient Morrison: I would continue to ask people to be patient. I know you can have kids in the car and there is anxiety and there is stress and the traffic is not moving quickly but the best thing to do \u2013 the best thing that helps those out there volunteering, out there trying to restore some order to these situations, is for everyone to be patient. That help will arrive. Scott Morrison gets quite testy with this question: Question: Can you tell Australians about what your government is doing to mitigate the plan for the long-term economic and environmental impact of climate change over the generations as our children grow up? Morrison: Reduce our emissions because that is what a responsible country does. Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets, emissions reduction under our government is 50 million tons more than the previous government and we want to see them continue for this country and continue to better the achievements we have already made, with measures that achieve that. That is why our policies are being improved, the minister for energy and emissions reduction has already outlined that, he has flagged additional measures, where they can be put in place. Let me be clear to the Australian people, our emissions reductions policies will both protect our environment and seek to reduce the risk and hazard we are seeing today, at the same time, it will seek to make sure the viability of people\u2019s jobs and livelihoods, all around the country. What we will do is make sure our policies remain sensible, that they don\u2019t move towards either extreme and stay focused on what Australians need for a vibrant and viable economy, as well as a vibrant and sustainable environment. Getting the balance right is what Australia has always been able to achieve. Right now the focus as I said at the outset is to fight these fires, get people to safety. That is what we are focused on, that is what state agencies are focused on, that is what the commonwealth is doing through defence forces and other agencies to lend everything that can be done to get that operational response in place, to get help to where it is needed, get people to places of safety and sustain the firefighting effort. And with that, he ends the press conference and leaves the room. Scott Morrison finishes that answer with: The season has been quite extraordinary in terms of the drought that has proceded it. Lets hope, in the future, we will hope as we go through this year, we will see that drought end. That will, hopefully make sure we have a different situation as we confront next year\u2019s fire season. Other issues of how you manage hazard reduction are important, because as you say, the impact, more broadly of climate change on these issues has a pronounced effect on the length of the fire season. That, equally then has a need to address issues around hazard reduction for national parks, dealing with land clearing laws, zoning laws and planning walls around people\u2019s properties and where they can be built in countries like Australia, up and down the coast. That being the case with the climatic effects of what we are seeing, there are many restrictions around those effects that have to be reviewed on the basis on the broader climatic effect we are seeing in this country. He continues: Part of the review process will need to look at those issues at length. That is why the payments which I initiated not that many days ago was recognise the longer time of service that we saw volunteer firefighters have to engage in and states in New South Wales and Queensland have now triggered those payments. They haven\u2019t been triggered in the other states at this point but that is another factor which is assisting the commissioner in New South Wales in terms of how he is deploying and calling up his resources. There is also the issues of fuel loads which is very clear. That has been a constant source of feedback by those on the ground. Issues in national parks and issues of hazard reduction and how that has worked over a period of time, that needs to be looked at undoubtedly. The suggestion that there is a single policy, whether it be climate or otherwise, can provide a complete insurance policy on fires in Australia, well I don\u2019t think any Australian has ever understood that was the case in this country. On whether or not Scott Morrison is preparing for this to be Australia\u2019s new normal: One of the issues we will have to deal with in the review is the many contributing factors to this particular fire season and we can\u2019t go beyond the drought. As David has responsibilities in that area also, I mean one of the most striking things during this fire season was when I flew over the range and saw the two [crises] our nation has face come together on the other side of the Great Dividing Range with the drought and bushfires. The drought has created a tinder box around the country and that has, through various forms of ignition, has seen these fires run for long periods of time, particularly when there is no dousing rain that has normally followed. The longer-term impacts of what this means for fire seasons was what was looked at going into this season. There were many concerns that this type of fire season would have occurred last year. I remember those briefings very vividly and thankfully we were spared that last year but it has certainly hit us this year and that is the planning that was put in place for last year was going in place for this year. An event of this scale, you may never know specifically where it may run over the course of the country. You know the various factors that are combining together. Batlow \u2013 the former apple capital \u2013 is also being evacuated. Fire authorities called a town meeting yesterday to tell residents there is nothing they can do to stop the blazes coming and everyone should get out. The town has suffered immensely since imported varieties of apples started flooding the Australian market. There are those within the town who believe the fires, if they come through, could be the end of the town. If you are in that area, get out. Can more be done? Scott Morrison: We are considering every option because we know the fire season still has a long time to run and particularly now as we are calling in more ADF assets to deal with this, what we are constantly doing, as we have been doing for months, is looking at what the contingencies are going forward. Those contingencies are being worked on and the national security committee of cabinet will meet on Monday to consider those issues as well as the longer-term response and some issues we have identified to consider amongst premiers after the fires. I have to stress this, what the states are saying to us is \u201cLet us deal with the fires now, let us focus on that, give us every support you can to help us with that\u201d and the Victorian premier Dan Andrews has complimented the role between the commonwealth and the Victorian government in what is happening with the evacuation as we speak. That is the spirit in which we need to continue to engage this right now, right here. The longer-term issues are always being addressed. They are addressed after every single fire. One of the reasons \u2013 more homes would have been lost and more lives would have been lost and it is a tragedy how many have already been lost in this season, had it not been for the coordination and planning that our agencies have learned and put in place because of their response to previous natural disasters. What other assets are coming? Scott Morrison: At this stage it is still in a planning phase. We have a number of naval assets in New South Wales that have been assessed for how they can be tasked and to put them in a state of readiness. They haven\u2019t been called upon by the States. The Naval assets that in particular Victoria\u2019s requested are in place. We are also tasking spartans and C130s to assist with evacuations in Victoria but the weather conditions are making that difficult. Some of the other aviation efforts we have there are being used for Medivac purposes in getting those who are particularly in need of support. There is work being done over the last week, in particular, to look at all the medical response capabilities, particularly in New South Wales and in Victoria and the assessment there is very positive. Those services are not being overstretched at this point in time, in terms of the response they need to provide and that is a welcome piece of news. This is what happens when you work through managing and coordinating the response to these disasters. You are dealing with payments, medical supplies, aviation assets and what is further needed there, whether other assets need to be leased or brought to bear but we have over 140 aerial firefighting assets in Australia as part of the coordinated group we put together and put an additional $11 million to more recently as the fire season escalated. We move on to climate change: Question: You talked about anxiety and fear and terror in the community and you talked about operational issues today. What about the long-term threat? All the experts say this event is turbocharged by climate change and a lot of people would say your government is not doing enough about climate change. What about the long-term threat and what is your government doing to allay those fears and anxiety\u201d Scott Morrison: We\u2019ve always acknowledged the link between the broader issues of global climate change and what that means for the world\u2019s weather and the dryness of conditions in many places. I am sure you would also agree that no response by any one government anywhere in the world can be linked to any one fire event. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re suggesting that here in NSW, Victoria or anywhere else. Governments plans on climate change are very clear and the achievements we are making we have set out well. 2020 is the year we beat the Kyoto 2020 commitment. We don\u2019t just beat it by a bit, we beat it by a lot. We are one of the few countries that can say that. We have the policies and plans to ensure we will meet and beat our 2030 commitments and we will continue to manage those issues responsibly. Right now, as I said, my focus right now is to deal with the anxiety in the community is the support and supplies and getting people to safety and ensuring that our firefighters have every support they need and I said I am in constant contact with the premiers in terms of what, if any, other additional assistance they need to get the job done on the ground. When I speak to the firefighters, when I speak to those involved in the operational effort, that is what they want from us, they want support for what they need to do and that is what we are giving them. Question: Do you understand the frustration of people when you keep saying this is a state issue, this is the state agencies in control of this? We have fires raging all around the country and you\u2019re the prime minister. Scott Morrison: That is why the defence forces are out there and our agencies are providing for the payments. Our agencies are coordinating responses between commonwealth resources and state resources. That is what the commonwealth does in these situations and that is what the commonwealth will continue to do and what we won\u2019t allow to happen is for governments to be tripping over each other in order to somehow outbid each other in the response. What is needed is the coordinated response that these agencies planned for in circumstances like this. I understand the frustration, I understand the anxiety. I understand the fear also, but what I also understand is the need to allow the professionals and the experts who plan and then operationalise these responses to do their job and to give them every support and every resource, from the prime minister to the premier, to the mayor. Asked about residents in Lake Conjola who are without food, water or in a lot of cases, homes, Scott Morrison says: I can understand their frustration and some of these parts of the country are difficult for state authorities and agencies to get the support into. This is a fire front that was running pretty much all the way up the NSW border, all the way up to the upper reaches of the south coast and Lake Conjola sits in the middle of that. I know the area very well. There are many areas that are in that situation right now. That is why it is important to allow the response to just roll out and do it and as effectively and quickly and safely as possible. Scott Morrison continues on the \u201cdon\u2019t panic\u201d answer: We need to do that for as long as it takes and it will cost whatever it costs to ensure that we can continue to deploy this very well-coordinated response. In the midst of the disaster, I understand the anxiety and I understand the fear that is there for many and I understand the frustration but this is a natural disaster. Natural disasters are best dealt with through the methodical, well-coordinated response that we are seeing today. If it were not for their response over these many months \u2013 and you\u2019re right, we have seen far too many lost and as the premier in Victoria has indicated, still many understanding accounted for in the small communities in East Gippsland and it will be some time before we know where they are and if they are well or indeed they have been lost. Wait to ensure we do that, whether it is an evacuation or the medevacs that are occurring, is to continue to do it in the responsible and well-coordinated way we are doing. Had we not done that, many more would have been lost and many more properties. Scott Morrison is asked when is the time to actually be worried, or start panicking, given the extent of this natural disaster: There is no doubt natural disasters are termed that way because that is what they are. They are natural disasters. They wreak this sort of havoc when they affect our country as they have for a very long time. The scale and length of this bushfire season is something I have referred to now on many occasions. The first fire incident that I attended with Jenny was back in Conungra back in September. The fires have raged in Queensland, South Australia, NSW, Victoria, Tasmania and there were concerns in Western Australia. That is all true. The best way to respond is the way that Australians have always responded to these events and that is to put our confidence in those who are fighting these fires and who are experienced and know what they are doing, the agencies that prepare 24/7, seven days a week, that is what their job is. Emergency management Australia at a commonwealth level, its task is to ensure that in times like this, there is a fully coordinated response between the commonwealth and the states and even at the local level and the payments are appropriate and they are trigger and actioned and that is what is occurring. What we are saying is we cannot control the natural disaster but what we can do is control our response, what we can do is support those who are out there putting themselves at risk by showing the patience and the calm that is necessary, that enables them to do their job. Police are now turning around northbound traffic at Milton \u2013 effectively cutting the Princes Highway and the northbound route from the south coast to Sydney. Official advice from NSW Live Traffic is for people to delay their journey. David Littleproud pleads with people to be patient but also listen to emergency service personnel when they tell you to get out. We have already had too many fatalities in the fires and, sadly, we have had three brave Australians who were serving their community and their country who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Out of respect to them, it is your responsibility to listen to those emergency service personnel, to do what they tell you but to be prepared and to act now. This is not \u201cshe will be right\u201d sort of moment. This is a serious situation as we get into the weekend. It is imperative that you look after yourselves. There is a responsibility to look after yourselves and your families and you owe it to the men and women who are fighting the fires to keep you safe to do exactly what they say. Scott Morrison again asks people in the fire zone to be patient: My simple request is to be patient. To have confidence in the state agencies that are leading the operational response on the ground. If you are in a position where you can get yourself to safety, please do that and follow the instructions that are available to you. If you are in a position where you have to hold and wait, then know that there is support that will get to you. It is already on its way and in those places where it has already been able to be delivered, we thank those who were able to get that support to where it is needed. The stores will then be built up again, particularly using the assets and support of the ADF. There is a major evacuation, I have alluded to it and what is happening in Victoria at the moment with the [HMAS] Choules assisting with that. There has been no request from NSW of a similar ADF support for an evacuation of that nature on the south coast given that the roads are open. If you are able to get into your vehicle and drive back to Sydney or Canberra, then that is the advice you are receiving to follow that local instruction. Scott Morrison tells us what the emergency commissioners have already made clear \u2013 the fires will continue to burn for months in many areas, until there is a change in conditions. From this point on, what the commonwealth will continue to do is to support those operational efforts. We will also be there to support the recovery efforts and they will start coming into being in the weeks ahead and months ahead indeed and I have already had a number of discussions about the various payments and forms of assistance that go to small businesses that have been impacted and the category C assistance which is already available in so many local government areas around the country, in these affected areas. That support will be very important and there are other levels of assistance that we can move to as we saw was so effective in response to the north Queensland floods. Making sure that support flows quickly and effectively is so important to get the recovery effort up and running after these fires. Unlike a flood, where the water will recede, in a fire like this, it goes on and it will continue to go on as those in the agencies have advised us, until we can get some decent rain that can deal with some of the fires that have been burning for many, many months. Scott Morrison appeals directly to those attempting to evacuate and asks them to stay calm and be patient: I would continue to ask people to be patient. I know you can have kids in the car and there is anxiety and there is stress and the traffic is not moving quickly but the best thing to do \u2013 the best thing that helps those out there volunteering, out there trying to restore some order to these situations is for everyone to be patient. That help will arrive. There are parts of both Victoria and NSW which have been completely devastated, with a loss of power and communications. Every absolute effort is in train to ensure that those things can be stood up as soon as possible. In some cases we have been able to get tankers in to restore fuel supplies, that is greatly assisted now. There are other places which are still too difficult to get the supply into now but we will be able to do that as soon as we possibly can. Defence has been assisting in providing advice to the communications companies to assist in getting communications restored as soon as possible and the same things are being done when it comes to standing up energy supplies. In particular, down in Cobargo and places like that, where dairies have been milking and they simply have to pour the milk down the hill because of the lack of power to those areas at this time. That is the tragedy of what is occurring as a result of these disasters. But I do want to commend the state agencies and their leaders, both within the fire services and other emergency management agencies that are coordinating this response and leading it both in Victoria and in NSW. On the calls for further ADF assistance, Scott Morrison says: All of these assets, I should stress, whether it is the Black Hawks or any of the other things that are being made available, that is being done to get it in readiness to deploy and then, secondly, it is activated at the request of the state agencies. What you cannot have in these situations is governments stepping over the top of each other in responding to a natural disaster like this. It must follow a clear chain of command. It must follow the headquarters model which is in place and which commonwealth authorities are embedded in, both in NSW and in Victoria. In both NSW and Victoria, there are joint taskforces which have been stood up by defence which are coordinating the defence engagement in each of those responses and they are fully plugged into the headquarters in NSW and in Victoria. Scott Morrison on the defence force deployments: There is also the work that is being done through emergency management Australia. It is so important, particularly as we are going through what can be the very dangerous exercise of evacuations and getting people to safety, as the premier of Victoria Dan Andrews just stated a few moments ago, that this be done in a very coordinated and safe way. So it is important, as we work through those evacuations, that people continue to remain patient and remain calm and to follow instructions. For those places where there is still stores and other assistance to be provided, it is on its way. I have just now come off the phone speaking to the CDF, General Houston \u2013 Campbell I should say, to ensure that all of that effort is being deployed right around the country, as it is needed. The other important assistance that is being provided by the commonwealth is the support provided by the defence forces themselves as I have just noted. We have deployed naval efforts which we moved earlier this week and there are other assets that have been identified and are awaiting tasking. Scott Morrison: The priority today is fighting fires and evacuating, getting people to safety. What is incredibly important is we continue to maintain the focus on these very important tasks. Those tasks are being well led and run by our state authorities, both in Victoria and in NSW and I am in constant contact with premiers of both of those states. I am also mindful, though, of the emerging situation in South Australia and even in Tasmania and we will continue to work closely with those states, where the need arises. At a commonwealth level, our task has been to fully support and provide whatever assistance is necessary through all the various agencies of the commonwealth. Now, that in order has gone from the provision of disaster payments that have now exceeded some more than $21m in NSW alone and we expect more of that to continue in Victoria as the full devastation of the fires there becomes more evident and the damage assessments and people are able to make claims on those funds. But that has been an important task for the commonwealth, working with the states, where the assistance has been triggered to get those payments to people as quickly as possible and I want to thank all of those and Services Australia have been working to be able to deliver those payments and support but also the state government agencies who have directly been involved in the administering of those payments. Scott Morrison has begun his press conference from the Sydney CPO (the federal government building in NSW). He has just returned from the funeral of Horsley Park brigade deputy captain Geoff Keaton. To be there with his partner and his parents and his broader family, it was important to be able to honour his great sacrifice and his tremendous service. Sadly, we will be attending two more of these services in the not too distant future. It was also tremendous to be there with the men and women of the Rural Fire Service brigade as they provided their guard of honour for their mate. From all of the nation to Jess and the family, we extend our deepest sympathies and for those who will be gathering together for similar services in the near future, we extend that to them also. Daniel Andrews: I\u2019m sad to have to report that there are at least 17 people that at this stage we cannot account for. Their whereabouts is unknown to us, plus there is one person confirmed as deceased. Whilst Victoria police have not been through the official identification processes, it is clear that the Roberts family have identified Mr Roberts and we send our condolences to their family and the Buchan community to whom he was so well-known and very highly regarded. That\u2019s at least 17 people whose whereabouts cannot be accounted for, plus one confirmed deceased. As we get further information we\u2019ll update you, I don\u2019t propose to go through the 17 different location. That doesn\u2019t serve any purpose. They are from East Gippsland, from a number of smaller communities across East Gippsland. That number may grow or indeed people may report to authorities or we can get to them either via mobile phone coverage or getting people into those communities. It may be some of those people are safe but we hold very significant fears for the welfare of anybody who is missing at this time. The Princes Highway remains closed in the following locations: \u2022 Between Batemans Bay and Moruya \u2022 Between Narrabarba and Cann River (Victoria) - From Narrabarba, you can travel west on Imlay Road to the Monaro Highway to head north. The Snowy Mountains Highway is open between Bega and Adaminaby so anyone on the far south coast is also able to travel to Canberra or Sydney via the Snowy Mountains Highway to Cooma, the Monaro Highway to Canberra and the Hume Highway. Many other roads remain closed including: South of Nowra: \u2022 Jerrawangala to Tomerong: Turpentine Road is closed \u2022 Wandandian: Wandean Road is closed between the Princes Highway and Bollerang Road \u2022 Nowra Hill to Charleyong: Braidwood Road/Nerriga Road is closed Around Braidwood: \u2022 Braidwood to Nelligen: the Kings Highway is closed \u2022 Braidwood to Moruya: Araluen Road is closed \u2022 Braidwood to Cooma: Cooma Road is closed In and around the Snowy Mountains: \u2022 Tumut to Adaminaby: the Snowy Mountains Highway is closed \u2022 Batlow to Tumbarumba: Batlow Road is closed \u2022 Jindabyne to Khancoban: Alpine Way is closed A number of smaller local roads are also closed in the south coast and Snowy Mountains areas, and many roads crossing the NSW-Victorian border are also closed, including the Monaro Highway between Rockton and Cann River (Victoria). Up to the minute information about road closures is available at livetraffic.com. The NSW police have more information on road closures and the evacuation of the south coast and Snowy Mountains. The Transport Management Centre has provided the following information about traffic movement and road closures, which is current as at 11.30am: Motorists on the south coast are able to travel north on the Princes Highway from Batemans Bay. The Princes Highway as also recently reopened between Tilba Tilba and Brogo, as well as between Falls Creek and Milton. A reduced speed limit of 60km/h is in place, and the highway may be closed for short periods to allow emergency vehicles through. Motorists are advised to take extreme care, follow the directions of emergency services and traffic crews, and drive with headlights switched on due to smoke in the area. Motorists should also allow plenty of extra travel time and be patient as northbound traffic on the Princes Highway is very heavy approaching Wandandian and is queued back almost to Termeil. NSW authorities have once again shut the highway out of the south coast as conditions become too dangerous. While Anthony Albanese is speaking, the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has confirmed one person has died and 17 people are unaccounted for after the East Gippsland fires. The death, previously reported, was that of Mick Roberts in Buchan. But people voted for Scott Morrison and his government\u2019s policies: What we\u2019re seeing, though, I think, is the need for leadership on these issues. And, you know, you can\u2019t say \u2013 I mean it\u2019s quite right that there have been bushfires in Australia before. But what we are seeing is greater intensity, the season being longer and, unfortunately, this could be the new norm and the devastation \u2013 and when we talk about economic cost, the economic cost of this crisis, this national emergency is enormous. Not just in terms of, of course, the most important cost is the cost of lives. But the disruption as well are, the social impact of people losing their homes, the economic impact long-term of having to not just rebuild, but the impact on the south coast economy. Enter the Blue Mountains, I was up in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, this is their high-end season. You had the Victoria and Albert Hotel at Mount Victoria that normally would have a big Christmas lunch. They had bookings. I spoke to the proprietor there with [the Labor MP] Susan Templeman. Everyone had cancelled. They had to go ahead. There are businesses shut. The long-term impact of the fact that we\u2019ve lost 900,000 hectares of Blue Mountains national park, that will have an impact on bushwalkers, people staying in the mountains. The economic cost as well as the social costs, the health cost to our health system of people being admitted to hospital because of the nature of the air that we\u2019re breathing, is just extraordinary. And I think it\u2019s about time that those people who say, \u201cOh, climate change is nonsense. Acing on climate change will cost us,\u201d actually had an assessment of what the cost of inaction is, because it\u2019s astronomical and we\u2019re seeing it played out right now. The government says it will meet its Paris targets, to which Anthony Albanese said: Except, of course, that they gave up the ghost when they went to Madrid. They gave up the falsity for all to see, because they argued there that we needed to take into account the Kyoto period emissions, which were when Labor was in government \u2013 because of renewable energy target \u2013 and also, by the way, because of the Queensland, the former Queensland Labor government\u2019s policies on land clearing that made a big difference there as well. Both policies that the Coalition opposed. So they can\u2019t oppose the policies and then try and take the credit. They need to, going forward, have a serious policy of meeting their open targets. So their targets, signed up to by Tony Abbott, they need to do that without accounting tricks. Would Labor introduce a carbon price? We\u2019d have a mechanism of some form that would provide that investment service. And what else is needed, according to Anthony Albanese? Well, we also need a renewable energy target. And so the mechanism that drives change through our domestic economy as well as a renewable energy target, the sort of mechanisms that some of them are already in place \u2013 the government tried to get rid of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. That\u2019s playing a really important role in providing that financing options and it\u2019s making money, by the way, for the taxpayer at the same time, because it makes sense. And government needs to abandon the ridiculous talk of a taxpayer-subsidised coal-fired power station. The market is speaking. The cheapest way of us increasing supply and certainty in the market is through renewables and through storage, which provides that base-load capacity. What does Anthony Albanese think needs to change? Does the nation need to consider a carbon price? Well, it needs a mechanism of some form. Now, the government came up with under Malcolm Turnbull, it went through the party room, the NEG, the national energy guarantee. What you need is a signal that creates an investment certainty. Now NEG was one. There\u2019s a range of mechanisms that you can have. But you set something that is a signal to the market so that you get your lowest-cost emissions reductions, and good climate policy is actually good for jobs, it\u2019s good for lowering prices as well as lowering emissions. Anthony Albanese is using this interview, which comes ahead of Scott Morrison\u2019s doorstop interview at 1pm, to hit the government over its climate change strategy. Well, the government has to actually not say that nothing needs to change. The truth is that they\u2019re right when they say Australia acting alone is not enough, but the problem is not only are we not acting, we\u2019re actually preventing global action through the argument that we put at Madrid that, rather than reducing emissions, we should have accountancy fiddles. Australia has an interest in being strong advocates for greater global action, not being a handbrake. We need, of course, to act domestically as well, but we can\u2019t be big players on the international stage. And here\u2019s the contradiction in the government\u2019s position \u2013 they say, \u201cOh, well, we\u2019re just 1.3% of emissions, therefore we don\u2019t have a responsibility to act. It won\u2019t really make a difference,\u201d is what they\u2019re saying. But the truth is that if everyone says that, of course, no one will act \u2013 that\u2019s the first point. But the second point is we don\u2019t have credibility in those international forums. The Labor leader starts with this: Well, this is a national emergency. And the tragedy of this is it\u2019s precisely the sort of predictions that were made by scientists and, unfortunately, the science is proving itself to be correct, that Australia, as a dry continent, the nature of our climate, means we\u2019re particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. We were told that the bushfire season would be longer and more intense, and that is what we\u2019re seeing, and coming immediately after the drought, it just means that parts of tropical rainforest were burning for the first time just a couple of months ago. And it\u2019s continued to take place. This is certainly not business as usual. Anthony Albanese is in the ABC 24 studios for an interview. Looks like he is going harder on the link between these fires and climate change. A very big thank you to Luke for his work all day. You have Amy Remeikis with you for the next few hours. Further to that, the local member, Helen Haines, has told the ABC: \u201cIt is a very serious situation up here in the Corryong region and many people have been evacuated from their homes and have been coming to the emergency relief centres, both in Corryong and Tallangatta. \u201cThose people now have dispersed to other places, but there are some people still in the evacuation centres and people have been coming in with food and supplies and water and anything they can think of that can help people.\u201d I have been asked to provide an update to what is happening at Corryong in Victoria\u2019s north-east. The Herald Sun has reported that more than 100 cars left the town last night in a convoy led by fire crews. There are fears the town will come under threat again when conditions deteriorate tomorrow and particularly on Saturday. Those who have left are at a relief centre at Tallangatta. As far as warnings go, there is a watch and act in place for Biggara, Corryong, Cudgewa, Koetong, Nariel Valley, Tintaldra, Towong, Walwa and surrounding communities. There is a large bushfire within the Alpine national park north of Tom Groggin that is not yet under control. The bushfire is travelling in a south-easterly direction on a large front. There are multiple bushfires threatening communities in this area that started as a result of dry lightning. There is a significant fire activity in both NSW and Victoria, smoke will be visible from these fires. You must continue to remain vigilant as conditions may change. The weather predicted for the approaching weekend could result in significant fire movement. Use this time to review your bushfire survival plan and implement any changes. Don\u2019t wait, leaving now is the safest option \u2013 conditions may change and get worse very quickly. Emergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay. The Australian defence force has issued a statement today saying it has expanded its contribution to the bushfire effort. It is a very long press release that outlines everything Defence has done and plans to do during the crisis so I won\u2019t reproduce it for you. What appears to be new since yesterday is: An expansion of the ground transport and logistics tasks already supported to five new locations \u2013 Tamworth, Mudgee, Nowra, Maitland and Queanbeyan. This task is expected to run from 6-20 January. The provision of personnel and equipment to supplement state capabilities to clear and reopen roads in fire-affected areas of Victoria, as well as general engineering tasks to remove debris from public areas and clear fire breaks and fire trails. This will begin today with priority for the Gippsland region. Light engineering. Fire trail clearance at Mudgee from 6-10 January. Recovery operations. Provision of personnel and equipment to undertake recovery tasks as identified and assessed by the NSW government based on advice from specialist ADF advisers. These tasks \u2013 in Tamworth, Wollondilly, Nowra, Mudgee, Maitland and Wingecarribee \u2013 will start from 6 January. As we\u2019ve already reported, Defence also says HMAS Choules and MV Sycamore has begun \u201crelief operations in Mallacoota this morning, including supporting the relocation of vulnerable and high-priority people to Westernport\u201d. NSW authorities say people in the Kosciuszko national park must evacuate by 10am tomorrow. Here is the alert and evacuation notice from the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. Current situation: There are large fires to the west and south of Kosciuszko national park that will move in an easterly direction in coming days. There are multiple other fires within the park which could expand in coming days. NPWS is continuing to gather intelligence about the location, size and predicted progress of these fires. Lightning and ember attacks may result in additional fires. It is unlikely that these fires will be contained in the coming days or weeks. The current weather forecast indicates that Saturday 4 January will be a bad fire weather day. Fires are likely to spread quickly prior to and during this Saturday. This is not a fire season that NSW has seen before. It is hotter and drier than we have previously experienced. Evacuations: An evacuation order is applied to all of Kosciuszko national park and resorts and all other places located within Kosciuszko national park. All people located in Kosciuszko national park must exit Kosciuszko national park boundaries before the deadline of 10am eastern daylight savings time Friday 3 January 2020. This is an essential measure to protect life. People outside of Kosciuszko national park need to monitor advice from the NSW RFS and other fire and emergency service agencies to remain informed as to whether other areas outside of Kosciuszko national park need to evacuate. Kosciuszko national park is closed for entry. Permanent residents and essential staff may enter but must have evacuated by the deadline of 10am, Friday 3 January 2020. This good news came in from NSW police late last night. Police have confirmed a woman missing after her home was destroyed at Conjola Park yesterday is safe and well. Fears had been held for the 81-year-old woman after her home in Kurrajong Crescent was destroyed by bushfires that swept through about 2pm yesterday (Tuesday 31 December 2019). Officers from south coast police district had been unable to confirm the whereabouts of the woman, and initiated inquiries; however, about 5pm today (Wednesday 1 January 2020), the woman\u2019s family told police she\u2019d been rescued from her home as the fire was nearing the home. Police have now confirmed the woman is safe and well in nearby Manyana. Thredbo is being evacuated. The prime minister\u2019s office has told media Scott Morrison will hold a press conference at 1pm in Sydney. I\u2019ve been speaking to Kelly, who is down in the isolated town of Mallacoota who was holidaying with family when the fire hit on Tuesday. He was among the 4,000 people who took refuge on the foreshore. As we have been hearing, supplies are running low in the town as the navy and police boats bring in food and water by sea. Reports are that about 100 homes have been destroyed. \u201cThe town\u2019s food supplies are getting a belting so not sure how long the food is going last,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThe local bakery has closed as of this morning as their generator [is down] so bread is now out of the question.\u201d His wife, Stacey, is a nurse and has walked down to the medical centre to offer some help. \u201cThey could not have been happier to see her as they are so under the pump with patients,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cMy boys done a sweep of the lake and picked up all the rubbish around the edges to help out in any way. We were meant to go home Saturday but that won\u2019t be happening and to be honest we are happy to stay and help out in any way we can. \u201cOne thing I will say is fuck I\u2019m a proud Australian because when the shit hits the fan people stop their lives to help those who are struggling to give them a hand back up.\u201d For those looking to get out of the NSW south coast before Saturday, the ABC has this very useful article. Kerri Warren, a real estate agent in Mallacoota, says she estimates about 100 homes have been lost in the Victorian coastal town. That does not include other structures like sheds. I mentioned earlier this morning that Scott Morrison has declined to go on ABC News Breakfast to discuss the fires. That\u2019s according to Michael Rowland, who noted the PM was yesterday entertaining the Australian and New Zealand cricket teams at Kirribilli House. \u201cHopefully we will see the prime minister touring some of the fire-ravaged areas over the course of the next day or so,\u201d Rowland told viewers. The reaction to the fact Morrison is not front and centre during the crisis is continuing. The Ten Network\u2019s national affairs editor, Hugh Riminton, has written this devastating piece. Riminton argues that those arguing against action on the climate emergency have shifted from denial to the claim that Australia\u2019s emissions are not globally significant. But citing Australia\u2019s efforts at war time and comparing, he writes: And broadly speaking, that\u2019s true. Our emissions, at less than 2% of global totals, will not be decisive in the fight. Therefore, it follows, we can change nothing. So let\u2019s sprout new coalmines all over Queensland and leave the issue to someone else. And how gutless would that be? In a nation that rightly reveres its Anzac ideals, here\u2019s a reminder: Australia has never beaten any deadly threat on our own. Arguing the response from Canberra has equated to \u201cnothing\u201d, he concludes: We are a burning nation led by cowards. It\u2019s time we all got a lot more angry about it. The full piece is definitely worth a read. Some readers from outside Australia have been in touch about the current fundraising efforts. To remind you, the Red Cross is running a fundraising drive, which you can read about here. My colleague Naaman Zhou looked at the ways you can assist in this story. Note that he compiled this piece before the Red Cross drive was established. On the subject of the long queues at supermarkets on the NSW south coast, I have received this statement from a Woolworths spokesperson: We\u2019re working hard to keep stores on the south coast replenished with key essentials for the local community. All stores are currently open for trading with only our Bermagui store set to close at midday due to the planned evacuation of the town. We understand it\u2019s an anxious time and thank customers for their patience as we manage the increased demand and the road closures. We\u2019re also working closely with our partner the Salvation Army to ensure essential supplies are available for them to support their work in evacuation centres set up around the state. For those in Bateman\u2019s Bay, due to power and phone issues, the Woolies there is only accepting cash. Eftpos is not available. More from that press conference with authorities in eastern Victoria. My colleague, Calla Wahlquist, was in Lake Tyers this week. The Insurance Council has updated its figures this morning: there have now been 4,299 claims made totalling $297m. We\u2019ve just been to a briefing about the evacuation of Bendalong. There are about 1000 people in the caravan park, including huge numbers of kids, plus at least 3000 more in the villages of Bendalong, North Bendalong, Manyana and Cunjurong Point. We\u2019ve been told they will be letting people out in groups of 20 and we will be given time slots to leave over the next two days. They really want people out by Saturday, when the conditions are forecast to be catastrophic. The Bendalong road, the only way in and out has been impacted heavily by fire and we were told we would be driving over downed power lines. Once people reach the highway, they are expecting it to take 4 hours to reach Nowra, which usually takes 40 minutes. The big message is: don\u2019t go if you don\u2019t have enough fuel. The meeting was pretty calm but clearly families are keen to get out. Police in Victoria have charged a 36-year-old man with arson for allegedly starting a small fire in Johnsonville, which is in the midst of the bushfire-affected area in East Gippsland between Nicholson and Swan Reach, at 6.45pm last night. The charges, according to leading senior constable Natalie Dean, was \u201crecklessly cause bushfire and drug-related offences. The man will appear in Bairnsdale magistrates court this morning.\u201d There is obviously a pretty emotional reaction to these kind of charges when Australia is in the grips of a bushfire crisis and federal politicians have been highlighting the role of arsonists in starting bushfires, but it is worth noting that the vast majority of the bushfires that are burning in Australia right now were started by lightning. The three major fires that form the East Gippsland fire complex were all started by lightning, and hundreds more small fires were started by lightning when the pyrocumulonimbus from the 14km-high smoke column began generating its own thunderstorms. You can read more about that phenomenon here. According to Crime Statistics Victoria, there were 32 recorded incidents of someone being charged with causing a bushfire between 1 January and 30 September, 2019. In 2018, 48 incidents of someone being charged with causing a bushfire were recorded. The insurance industry has declared a catastrophe in hundreds of postcodes, stretching from East Gippsland in Victoria all the way north to the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. So far there have been 3,870 insurance claims totalling more than $182m \u2013 but these numbers are bound to soar once damage is assessed from the fires over the new year period. The Black Saturday fires in Victoria in 2009, which killed 173 people, caused about $1.7bn in damage, while the 1967 Black Tuesday fires in Tasmania, which killed 62 people, did more than $2bn in damage (in 2017 dollars). There is huge concern among people on the NSW south coast, as there would be in East Gippsland, in areas that have not yet burned. The situation that has fuelled much of this bushfire crisis \u2013 tinder-dry bushland after a severe drought \u2013 means the high risk remains in places that have not yet burned. The forecast for extreme weather conditions at the weekend are also scary. Katherine Boland, an artist and author from Merimbula on the NSW south coast, told Guardian Australia yesterday she would be at great risk if the bush near her property was in the path of a fire. \u201cThe worry for me is where I live at Merimbula is on the lake. My 90-year-old mother lives a couple of doors down from where I live. I\u2019m thinking about how I could get her out and where could I go. \u201cI\u2019ve actually lived in the area near the bush for 30 years. There were quite a few scary incidents but I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this in my 30 years living in this area. \u201cWe lived in the bush for all that time and never had to be evacuated. Everybody in this area knew this was going to happen, it\u2019s been so bad here that even the natives, the gum trees were stressed out and dying. It\u2019s tinder dry.\u201d Tony Murphy, the deputy emergency management Victoria commissioner, says authorities have already moved vulnerable people out of Mallacoota, the small coastal community on the Victoria-NSW border. You\u2019ll remember 4,000 people were huddled on the beach there on Tuesday as fire converged on the town. They have since been waiting for navy ship HMAS Choules to arrive. Murphy says they will \u201chave the opportunity\u201d to evacuate 500 people today, but he notes some people with 4WDs and caravans may wish to stay and leave later by road. He warns that might take two to three weeks. With the number of people inMallacoota, this is going to take days, if not weeks, to be able to achieve. But we\u2019ll do the absolute best we can with the defence force, with the other agencies in support, to get people to the place they need to be. Murphy says that the message from authorities is that those in a remote area or at-risk areas should leave, and leave early. He says the best option is to move to a major centre where there are services and support available. \u201cSo if you\u2019re in remote communities, we\u2019ll be sending out strong messaging you shouldn\u2019t be there, you should be in a safer place. That will be a very strong message.\u201d Andy Gillem, the Gippsland incident controller, says there are 900 people are working north of Bairnsdale, including towns like Clifton Creek, which was heavily impacted by the fires. He says there are active fires in the Swift\u2019s Creek Valley, and another creeping towards Ensay, the bottom of Mount Hotham and the Omeo area. \u201cThe fire crews are preparing the communities for the coming period of warm weather on the Friday and Saturday, and also to allow the emergency services to get access to the communities that are isolated,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fire-affected roads and tracks and crews are working hard to maintain or regain access to those areas.\u201d A briefing has begun in Bairnsdale in East Gippsland. There are 50 fires burning throughout the state, says Tony Murphy, the deputy emergency management Victoria commissioner. \u201cThe other issue we do have at the moment, we\u2019re anticipating some very significant fire weather coming into the weekend and on Saturday and that runs the risk of these fires growing in size yet again,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cThe other point I would like to make, we\u2019re offering some very significant relief to communities at the moment, including communities like Mallacoota, but also more remote communities in Gippsland, like Cann River.\u201d Things are looking very difficult in Narooma. Meanwhile, the ABC\u2019s Melissa Clarke is in Moruya, where she says people have been queuing outside the local supermarket since 6am. Staff have been letting people in 20 at a time to avoid chaos, Clarke says. Here is the top 10 cities with the worst air quality in the world. At 10am, Canberra again has topped the list. Sydney is in 34th place. We\u2019ve heard people have been rushing to hardware stores to pick up face masks. Some have sold out. It looks like lots of people are heeding the advice of authorities telling people to get out of the NSW south coast in the next 24 hours. I have received two separate emails from people telling me that the residents in the small NSW community of Tumbarumba have been advised to evacuate the town ahead of Saturday. Fire crews have told residents they can\u2019t guarantee the safety of those in the town with fierce winds predicted. There is currently no phone coverage or electricity. This area is outside the south coast region where the RFS has said holidaymakers must leave. Roads to the north, south and east are blocked by fire. Yesterday, the air quality in Canberra was at one point the worst of any city in the world. Yesterday, residents in the isolated community of Cann River were expressing concern about food shortages and other supply issues. Some told media they felt they were being forgotten. The town is along the Princes Highway between Orbost and Mallacoota and has been cut off due to the fires. Red Cross packages will be dropped in the town by air today. But Constance adds, \u201conce this (the fires) all goes, please come back\u201d. Tourism is crucial to communities on the south coast, which rely on the extra business during the holiday period. The NSW transport minister, Andrew Constance, is appearing on the ABC right now from the fire-impacted community of Batemans Bay. He advises that the Princes Highway is currently open to the north, allowing people to reach Sydney. To get to Canberra, they will have to go through Bega. Constance warns Saturday will be a \u201cterrible day\u201d that will force road closures through the area. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people trapped here because we are going to see, more than likely, the region cut off again, road-wise, potentially electricity-wise,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re expecting the forecasts to be as bad as Tuesday, if not worse. We just need people out of the area. That way we can use the valuable resources we\u2019ve got to look after local people.\u201d Some more on the prime minister\u2019s activities today. This was the scene at Narooma yesterday. The ABC has published this story saying that 250 truck drivers and holidaymakers are stranded at a remote roadhouse on the Nullarbor as a result of out-of-control bushfires. The Caiguna Roadhouse, which is 400km east of Norseman along the Eyre Highway, is now running out of toilet paper, beer and essential food items. The highway joins Western Australia and South Australia. The town has been cut off for extended periods over the past fortnight, the ABC reports, although the fire front is 200km away. We start the day with some sad news. The number of homes destroyed on the south coast after fires hit communities on Tuesday has risen from 176 to 381. This is a result of authorities returning to towns to assess the damage. The ABC reports that this takes the number of homes lost in NSW over the bushfire season to 1,298. Meanwhile, authorities are taking no risks ahead of what is expected to be extreme fire danger conditions on Saturday. Holidaymakers on the south coast have been told they must leave the area before Saturday. The map below shows the area involved. Good morning. I\u2019m Luke Henriques-Gomes. Thanks for joining us for another day of live bushfire coverage. Yesterday, the death toll rose as it was confirmed nine people have died since Christmas Day. But authorities are already warning that figure will rise when they are able to enter more communities devastated by the fires on Tuesday. We\u2019ll be with you throughout the day. If you want to get in touch, you can send me an email at luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or contact me on Twitter (@lukehgomes).",

Cold Blood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julien Lambert</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of that relearning is to do with the live event \u2013 unlike the film-making process of searching for the perfect shot. As Van Dormael says, Cold Blood is \u201cephemeral. It only exists if the audience is there. When making a film you have to write the whole thing precisely and then you look for the money to finance it \u2013 and if you don\u2019t get it, you rewrite. Here we are all together for a month and we don\u2019t have a story. We have nothing.\u201d<br><br>From the outside, improvising with household objects looks like playtime. They start around the kitchen table, then gradually expand. \u201cWe bring some sand, a lamp, a mobile,\u201d De Mey explains. \u201cPeople passing the house were like, \u2018This is not serious!\u2019 When the first performance was good, everyone was surprised \u2013 even us.\u201d The team still seem happily surprised while performing, sharing grins amid the elaborate scurry. \u201cEverybody\u2019s looking at everybody out of the corner of their eye,\u201d Van Dormael confirms. \u201cIt\u2019s like dancing a tango with eight people, and everybody\u2019s in the right place at the right moment.\u201d<br><br>The miracle of Cold Blood is its featherlight profundity, wit and melancholy. The collaborators began by exploring the theatrical possibilities of everyday tchotchkes, and the wry-witted writer Thomas Gunzig gradually threaded their improvisations together. The scenarios took inspiration from the Belgian comic Id\u00e9es Noires by Andr\u00e9 Franquin. \u201cEvery page is a really stupid way to die,\u201d Van Dormael says. \u201cIt\u2019s funny but frightening, and talks about dark things in a funny way.\u201d Tiny events have terrible consequences \u2013 involving a bra clasp or a trip to the carwash (brilliantly evoked using whirling feather dusters). \u201cFor the audience at the end it\u2019s cool,\u201d he muses. \u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling \u2013 not to be dead.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3fff995c50cd9b23e9d868af4a57cba609f10bf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fff995c50cd9b23e9d868af4a57cba609f10bf5/0_273_2000_2500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Brilliantly evoked ...

The best way is to do it fully.\u201d<br><br>De Mey was part of a remarkable generation that made Brussels central to contemporary dance during the 1980s and 90s. She and fellow choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker with whom she danced for many years, met in dance class when they were 13, and discovered the exuberant works of Maurice B\u00e9jart. \u201cEverybody in Belgium went to see B\u00e9jart\u2019s works,\u201d De Mey says. \u201cThey had an impact.\u201d Emerging dance-makers \u201chad an opportunity to develop a language,\u201d she continues. \u201cThat\u2019s why artists wanted to come to Belgium. Brussels is an international city but it\u2019s little. No big studios, no big stages \u2013 nothing except artists.\u201d<br><br>Who knew hands could carry such depth of emotion? \u201cIt\u2019s the part of the body we know best,\u201d Van Dormael says, \u201cbecause we see it in front of us. To see our face we need a mirror.\u201d Hands, he considers, are perfectly sized for dance on camera, which can\u2019t focus equally on the face and the dancing body. \u201cWhen you film the hand, it\u2019s face and body at the same time.\u201d<br><br>The pair have nonetheless moved on to full-body work: Amor draws on De Mey\u2019s near-death experience when she fell into a coma while touring in Toronto. Though she relinquished her signature roles for De Keersmaeker some time ago, she has never considered leaving the stage. \u201cNo, never,\u201d she says emphatically. \u201cI want to stay on stage until I die. I still have things to do.\u201d She is, her partner says fondly, \u201cthe unstoppable dancer\u201d.<br><br>\u2022Cold Blood is at the <a href=\"https://mimelondon.com/kiss-and-cry-cold-blood-2020/\">Barbican, London</a>, from 29 January to 1 February.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSzFFI3zmxw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aSzFFI3zmxw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

It\u2019s dance but just with hands. It\u2019s really funny, at 60 years old, to become incompetent and do something new.\u201d Part of that relearning is to do with the live event \u2013 unlike the film-making process of searching for the perfect shot. As Van Dormael says, Cold Blood is \u201cephemeral. It only exists if the audience is there. When making a film you have to write the whole thing precisely and then you look for the money to finance it \u2013 and if you don\u2019t get it, you rewrite. Here we are all together for a month and we don\u2019t have a story. We have nothing.\u201d From the outside, improvising with household objects looks like playtime. They start around the kitchen table, then gradually expand. \u201cWe bring some sand, a lamp, a mobile,\u201d De Mey explains. \u201cPeople passing the house were like, \u2018This is not serious!\u2019 When the first performance was good, everyone was surprised \u2013 even us.\u201d The team still seem happily surprised while performing, sharing grins amid the elaborate scurry. \u201cEverybody\u2019s looking at everybody out of the corner of their eye,\u201d Van Dormael confirms. \u201cIt\u2019s like dancing a tango with eight people, and everybody\u2019s in the right place at the right moment.\u201d The miracle of Cold Blood is its featherlight profundity, wit and melancholy. The collaborators began by exploring the theatrical possibilities of everyday tchotchkes, and the wry-witted writer Thomas Gunzig gradually threaded their improvisations together. The scenarios took inspiration from the Belgian comic Id\u00e9es Noires by Andr\u00e9 Franquin. \u201cEvery page is a really stupid way to die,\u201d Van Dormael says. \u201cIt\u2019s funny but frightening, and talks about dark things in a funny way.\u201d Tiny events have terrible consequences \u2013 involving a bra clasp or a trip to the carwash (brilliantly evoked using whirling feather dusters). \u201cFor the audience at the end it\u2019s cool,\u201d he muses. \u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling \u2013 not to be dead.\u201d De Mey and her fellow dancers aren\u2019t just twiddling digits \u2013 they give vibrant, full-body performances. \u201cIt\u2019s a movement from the body that ends at the extremity of the hands,\u201d says Van Dormael. \u201cOr,\u201d De Mey counters, \u201cit starts at the hands and comes back to the inside. The best way is to do it fully.\u201d De Mey was part of a remarkable generation that made Brussels central to contemporary dance during the 1980s and 90s. She and fellow choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker with whom she danced for many years, met in dance class when they were 13, and discovered the exuberant works of Maurice B\u00e9jart. \u201cEverybody in Belgium went to see B\u00e9jart\u2019s works,\u201d De Mey says. \u201cThey had an impact.\u201d Emerging dance-makers \u201chad an opportunity to develop a language,\u201d she continues. \u201cThat\u2019s why artists wanted to come to Belgium. Brussels is an international city but it\u2019s little. No big studios, no big stages \u2013 nothing except artists.\u201d Who knew hands could carry such depth of emotion? \u201cIt\u2019s the part of the body we know best,\u201d Van Dormael says, \u201cbecause we see it in front of us. To see our face we need a mirror.\u201d Hands, he considers, are perfectly sized for dance on camera, which can\u2019t focus equally on the face and the dancing body. \u201cWhen you film the hand, it\u2019s face and body at the same time.\u201d The pair have nonetheless moved on to full-body work: Amor draws on De Mey\u2019s near-death experience when she fell into a coma while touring in Toronto. Though she relinquished her signature roles for De Keersmaeker some time ago, she has never considered leaving the stage. \u201cNo, never,\u201d she says emphatically. \u201cI want to stay on stage until I die. I still have things to do.\u201d She is, her partner says fondly, \u201cthe unstoppable dancer\u201d. \u2022Cold Blood is at the Barbican, London, from 29 January to 1 February.",

      "bodyText": "Theatre Beckett Triple Bill Trevor Nunn\u2019s trio of short Beckett plays dwells on ageing and the unreliability of memory, kicking off with Krapp\u2019s Last Tape starring James Hayes, followed by Eh Joe, the first drama Beckett wrote for television, which features the voice of Billie Whitelaw\u2019s mentee Lisa Dwan opposite Niall Buggy. In The Old Tune, David Threlfall and Buggy play elderly men reminiscing about their lives. Separately at the Old Vic, a Beckett double bill includes Endgame with a star-studded cast (Alan Cumming, Daniel Radcliffe and Jane Horrocks) alongside a rarely staged short play, Rough for Theatre II. Jermyn Street theatre, London, 15 January-8 February. Old Vic, London, 27 January to 28 March The Welkin Maxine Peake and Ria Zmitrowicz star in Lucy Kirkwood\u2019s play about a woman waiting to be hanged for murder in 1759. When she claims she is pregnant, a jury of 12 matrons from local households in rural Suffolk is enlisted to decide whether she is telling the truth. Zmitrowicz plays the suspected murderer while Peake is a midwife and the woman\u2019s only supporter against a baying mob. National Theatre, London, 15 January-23 May. Streaming as part of National Theatre Live on 21 May Leopoldstadt Any new play by Tom Stoppard is a big event but this has added buzz for being his most personal. Set in the Jewish quarter of Vienna in 1900, it follows a prosperous Jewish family who have fled the pogroms. Stoppard, who left Czechoslovakia as a child refugee and whose grandparents died in Nazi concentration camps, says it has taken him a year to write it, though the \u201cgestation was far longer\u201d. Patrick Marber directs. Wyndham\u2019s theatre, London, 25 January-13 June I Think We Are Alone The Frantic Assembly company celebrates its 25th anniversary with this piece, co-directed by Scott Graham and Kathy Burke. Sally Abbott\u2019s play is billed as a \u201cdelicate and uplifting story about our fragility, resilience and need for love and forgiveness\u201d. Theatre Royal, Plymouth, 3-8 February. Then touring Far Away Twenty years on from its premiere, Caryl Churchill\u2019s surreal dystopia seems ever more resonant. Its world is riven with environmental chaos, ethnic cleansing and a growing disregard for humanity, all of which are wound around the sinister goings-on at a hat factory. Revived by Lyndsey Turner, it stars Bafta-winning Jessica Hynes as well as Aisling Loftus and Simon Manyonda. Graduate students from the London College of Fashion create the extravagant headwear for the hat parade scene. Donmar Warehouse, London, 6 February-28 March Pass Over Antoinette Nwandu\u2019s play was inspired by Waiting for Godot, although there are not only shades of Vladimir and Estragon but also enslaved African Americans of the plantations. When it was staged at the Lincoln Center in 2018, the New York Times thought it conjured a \u201cvivid world of injustice\u201d. Its UK premiere stars Paapa Essiedu, Alexander Eliot, and Gershwyn Eustache Jr, and is directed by Indhu Rubasingham. Kiln theatre, London, 13 February-21 March Back to the Future: The Musical The film about time-travelling teenager Marty McFly became a cultural phenomenon in 1985. This musical\u2019s production team includes Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, who wrote the screenplay. Some of the film\u2019s songs are kept in (The Power of Love, Johnny B Goode) while the Grammy award-winning Alan Silvestri, who wrote its score, composes new music and lyrics with Glen Ballard. The Tony award-winning Roger Bart stars as Doc Brown and McFly is played by Olly Dobson. Manchester Opera House, 20 February-17 May. Then West End Run Sister Run Greta Gerwig\u2019s film adaptation of Little Women has made the tender, complicated drama between sisters fashionable again. The playwright Chloe Moss probed one kind of unbreakable bond between women in her award-winning drama about former cellmates, This Wide Night. Now she brings sisterhood to the stage to examine its tensions, intimacies and dependencies through Connie and Ursula, whose stories are followed over four decades. A co-production between Sheffield theatre, Soho theatre and Paines Plough, directed by Charlotte Bennett. Sheffield theatres, 27 February-21 March; then Soho theatre, London, 25 March to 2 May Freedom Hi \u81ea\u7531\u95aa This is a synthesis of theatre and performance art made by Hong Kong artists based in the UK as well as British east Asian artists, during the autumn protests in Hong Kong by the pro-democracy movement. It aims to reflect on the right to protest as well as the gendered experience of political resistance, and combines personal testimony with geopolitical commentary in \u201can act of total theatre\u201d. Vault festival, London, 10-15 March All of Us One of the most exciting debuts of the year is Francesca Martinez\u2019s first play. A standup comedian who describes herself as \u201cwobbly\u201d (she has cerebral palsy), Martinez is a dedicated campaigner for disability rights. Her drama explores the effects of austerity and the struggle for those who don\u2019t fit in. National Theatre, London, 18 March-16 May Milky Peaks A fictional town in Snowdonia is hit by rightwing populism and dark machinations when it receives a nomination for Britain\u2019s best town award in Seiriol Davies\u2019 musical comedy about community, division and a mysterious force lurking in the mountains. Hailed as a modern Welsh fable, it features \u201cthree lost souls and a shabby drag queen\u201d who must save the town\u2019s soul. Theatr Clwyd, Mold, 20 March-11 April. Then touring Wales Mrs Puntila and Her Man Matti Bertolt Brecht\u2019s class comedy featuring a capitalist landowner and his chauffeur is given a gender switch by the crime novelist Denise Mina. Directed by DOT Theatre Istanbul\u2019s Murat Daltaban, it stars Elaine C Smith as the landowner with a split personality: unerringly avaricious when sober, spectacularly generous when drunk. Royal Lyceum theatre, Edinburgh, 28 February to 21 March. Then at Citizens theatre, Glasgow, 25 March-11 April Orlando Six years ago, Alice Birch staged Revolt. She Said. Revolt Again as part of an RSC series written by women to draw the attentions of the present generation to radicalism in the past. This latest work may be seen as an extension of that in spirit: Birch and longtime collaborator Katie Mitchell adapt Virginia Woolf\u2019s 1928 novel which deals with the very contemporary theme of gender identity and fluidity. Live cinema meets performance in this edgy iteration of the novel, performed in German with English surtitles. Barbican, London, 2-5 April Testmatch This study of sport, gender politics and the legacy of colonialism revolves around two cricket matches between England and India. In the present day, the Women\u2019s Cricket World Cup is held up by rain at Lord\u2019s, while a match in 19th-century, Raj-administered Calcutta sparks tensions between coloniser and colonised. Kate Atwell\u2019s play premiered in San Francisco in 2018 and she has been hailed as an exciting new voice in American theatre. Theatre Royal Bath, 2 April-9 May 4000 Miles Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Oscar-nominated for Call Me By Your Name, makes his West End debut alongside Eileen Atkins in a revival of Amy Herzog\u2019s 2011 drama. It\u2019s about a young man\u2019s cross-country cycle trip. Old Vic, London, 6 April-23 May Projekt Europa The RSC celebrates our relationship with Europe in three productions from leading European theatre-makers. Maria \u00c5berg and Judith Gerstenberg\u2019s adaptation of the satirical Czech novel Europeana compresses 100 years of European history into \u201ca narrative that collides the invention of the bra with the tragedy of the Holocaust\u201d. There\u2019s also a radical staging of Henrik Ibsen\u2019s Peer Gynt by Barbara Frey, and Blindness and Seeing, based on two novels by the Portuguese Nobel prize-winner Jos\u00e9 Saramago, adapted by Tiago Rodrigues. Swan theatre and the Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon. 9 April -26 September Castle Lennox This new play by Linda McLean follows a young autistic girl living in Lennox Castle, a Scottish hospital designed for the incarceration of the \u201cfeeble-minded\u201d that housed hundreds of disabled children and adults from the 1930s until its closure in 2002. The girl\u2019s story is loosely based on personal experiences collected from a similar home and the production, with songs by MJ McCarthy, will be performed by Lung Ha, a company of differently-abled artists. Royal Lyceum theatre, Edinburgh, 1-2 May The House of Shades Beth Steel has won plaudits for staging powerful stories of working-class lives. In 2014, her play Wonderland dramatised the lives of coal miners during the 1984 strike. This latest work is a broader, more epic survey of working-class Britain. Directed by Blanche McIntyre, it follows a family over half a century of social and political upheavals in a northern town and explores the evolutions of the labour movement. Almeida, London, 18 May-27 June Paradise Kate Tempest is a rapper, poet and polymath who has published award-winning poetry collections, acclaimed albums and a novel. Now there is a first play, too; billed as a \u201cpotent and dynamic reimagining\u201d of Sophocles\u2019 Philoctetes, it stars Lesley Sharp as the eponymous Greek hero and master archer. The story revolves around Philoctetes and Odysseus, once comrades but now enemies. June, National Theatre, London Hamlet In 2012, Cush Jumbo earned an Olivier award nomination for her role as Mark Antony in Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s all-female Julius Caesar. She has since worked widely across screen and stage, including the US TV series The Good Wife, and has written her own one-woman show. Now she gives us \u201ca new kind of Hamlet\u201d in a production directed by Greg Hersov, her long-standing collaborator. Young Vic, London, 6 July-20 August To Kill a Mockingbird This is Aaron Sorkin\u2019s maverick adaptation of Harper Lee\u2019s bestselling novel about racism in 1930s Alabama that her estate did not initially want staged because it allegedly deviated too greatly from the original story. Directed by Bartlett Sher, it comes to London in the 60th anniversary of the book\u2019s publication. Gielgud theatre, London, from 21 May The Glass Menagerie Tennessee Williams\u2019 autobiographical play about family love and its clash with creative freedom is perennially popular, with two major productions to be staged this year. This one is arguably the starriest of recent times: Isabelle Huppert plays Amanda Wingfield, the faded Southern belle and mother to two grownup children. Ivo van Hove directs in a collaboration with Od\u00e9on\u2013Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Europe. In French with English surtitles. Barbican, London, 5-11 June A Doll\u2019s House This hotly anticipated production of Ibsen\u2019s play marks Jessica Chastain\u2019s West End debut. Chastain is known for her work in films such as Terrence Malick\u2019s Tree of Life and The Help (which earned her an Oscar nomination) but she began her career on stage. Director Jamie Lloyd calls this \u201ca bold reappraisal of Ibsen\u2019s great masterpiece\u201d. Playhouse theatre, London, 10 June-5 September Sunday in the Park With George A garlanded musical meets a garlanded Hollywood star in Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\u2019s Pulitzer-winning masterpiece, which stars Jake Gyllenhaal as the French artist Georges Seurat, and Annaleigh Ashford as his lover. Originating at the New York City Center in 2016, it became one of the fastest-selling musicals on Broadway the following year. It is directed by the book writer\u2019s niece, Sarna Lapine. Savoy theatre, London, 11 June-5 September Semmelweis Mark Rylance had the idea of a drama based on the true story of a pioneering Hungarian doctor, Ignaz Semmelweis, who made a radical discovery that could save new mothers, only to have his sanity doubted by the medical profession. Written by Stephen Brown in collaboration with director Tom Morris and Rylance. Bristol Old Vic, 13 June-25 July The Book of Dust: La Belle Sauvage Seventeen years ago, Nicholas Hytner adapted Philip Pullman\u2019s bestselling His Dark Materials trilogy at the National Theatre. Now he takes on the first in a prequel trilogy of fantasy novels, set 12 years earlier. It is adapted by Bryony Lavery with music composed by the Tony-nominated Grant Olding. Bridge theatre, London, 11 July-10 October Is God Is Aleshea Harris won the American Playwriting Foundation award for this play in 2016. A modern myth about twin sisters who travel from the south to California to \u201cexact righteous revenge\u201d, it draws on influences that range from spaghetti westerns to hip-hop and Afropunk, and explores what it means to be black and female, alongside patricide and family dysfunction. It seems perfectly paired with Ola Ince, the director of acclaimed and edgy productions from Debris Stevenson\u2019s Poet in Da Corner to Branden Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019 Appropriate. Royal Court, London, 20 July-15 August The Wife of Willesden Zadie Smith published her debut novel, White Teeth, in 2000. Twenty years later comes her debut play: a reimagining of Chaucer\u2019s The Wife of Bath, which shed light on the role of women in the late middle ages and was the bawdiest of all the Canterbury Tales. Smith re-envisages Chaucer\u2019s story in the west London borough where she was raised, raising questions about women\u2019s place in society today. Kiln theatre, London, December Dance Black Waters Phoenix Dance Theatre\u2019s artistic director Sharon Watson continues to tackle serious political stories through dance. This time it is two shameful incidents of British colonial history: the massacre of more than 130 African slaves aboard the Zong ship in 1781, and the incarceration of freedom fighters at Kala Pani prison in Raj-era India. Black Waters is, unusually, jointly created by three choreographers \u2013 Watson, Shambik Ghose and Mitul Sengupta \u2013 bringing a trio of perspectives to the stage. Leeds Playhouse, 12-15 February. Then touring Bluebeard One of the late Pina Bausch\u2019s legendary early works for Tanztheater Wuppertal, from 1977, remarkably never before performed in the UK. Here it gets a belated premiere (and the first staging anywhere for 29 years). It\u2019s a disturbing piece, drawing loosely on B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k\u2019s opera in its illustration of a murderously dysfunctional couple \u2013 the misery between men and women being one of Bausch\u2019s enduring themes. Bluebeard is both more dancerly and more raw and radical than much of Bausch\u2019s later work. Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, 12-15 February Deluxe This year marks the 20th anniversary of the BalletBoyz company. Back in 2000 it was a breakaway project for two ex-Royal Ballet dancers, Michael Nunn and William Trevitt; now it\u2019s a strong company of young male dancers, as well as a launchpad for Nunn and Trevitt\u2019s film-making. The company\u2019s new stage show, Deluxe, features choreography from Shanghai-based Xie Xin and and a piece by Punchdrunk\u2019s Maxine Doyle, set to live music from Mercury-nominated jazz saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi. Theatre Royal, Glasgow, 1 March. Then touring. Revisor Choreographer Crystal Pite\u2019s first collaboration with writer/actor Jonathon Young yielded arguably the best dance work of the century so far, Bettroffenheit. So hopes are exceedingly high for their new piece, Revisor, an ambitious revision of Nikolai Gogol\u2019s 1836 farce The Government Inspector in which Pite and Young turn their hands to political satire. Early reviews suggest a clever, challenging and thought-provoking work. Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, 3-5 March Black Marrow If you\u2019ve seen Thom Yorke and Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s short film Anima, you\u2019ve already seen some of the choreography for Black Marrow, created by Damien Jalet and Iceland Dance Company\u2019s artistic director Erna \u00d3marsd\u00f3ttir. The cool Reykjavik company presents the full work, which asks urgent questions about humans\u2019 reliance on oil. Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, 21 March Double Murder The first show announced for 2020\u2019s Brighton festival is a new creation from choreographer Hofesh Shechter that will play in a double bill with 2016\u2019s Clowns and promises to be a foil for that piece\u2019s unsettling energy. Meanwhile Shechter\u2019s blisteringly talented apprentice company, Shechter II, celebrates the 10th anniversary of his acclaimed Political Mother by taking the work that once shredded speakers at Brixton Academy on an \u201cunplugged\u201d tour of smaller venues. Brighton festival, 2-3 May New Work for Goldberg Variations Following years of obscurity, New York choreographer Pam Tanowitz leapt to the top of everyone\u2019s must-see list when she brought her version of TS Eliot\u2019s Four Quartets to London last May, with its rich textures and Cunningham-influenced lines. Goldberg Variations is the piece that preceded Four Quartets in 2016 and pushed Tanowitz into the spotlight in the US. Here it gets its European premiere, performed by seven dancers surrounding the grand piano of Simone Dinnerstein. Barbican, London, 6-9 May The Dante Project A mega-project from choreographer Wayne McGregor and some stellar collaborators including composer Thomas Ad\u00e8s and artist Tacita Dean. McGregor dives into Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy in an epic journey through purgatory and into paradise with, no doubt, his usual questing sense of physical and intellectual exploration. And while you\u2019re booking Royal Ballet tickets, get one for Cathy Marston\u2019s new piece The Cellist, about Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 (17 Feb to 4 Mar). Royal Opera House, London, 6 May-1 June Curated by Carlos Exciting times in Birmingham as Carlos Acosta takes over as artistic director at Birmingham Royal Ballet in January. The first taste of his programming comes in the summer at a festival celebrating this new chapter for BRB. Full details are still to be announced, but we know it features Acosta\u2019s own spirited production of Don Quixote and a mixed bill that opens with a duet created by Spanish choreographer Goyo Montero for Acosta and the amazing Alessandra Ferri. Birmingham Hippodrome, June Singin\u2019 in the Rain Former Royal Ballet principal turned song-and-dance man Adam Cooper reprises his star turn as Don Lockwood, the Gene Kelly role in MGM classic Singin\u2019 in the Rain. Jonathan Church\u2019s joyful production originally opened in 2011 at Chichester Festival and played in the West End. It returns for a summer season at Sadler\u2019s Wells, with Olivier award-nominated choreography from Andrew Wright and 14,000 litres of water on stage each night. Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, 24 July-30 August Comedy Jessica Fostekew Who gets to decide what\u2019s womanly? One of the breakout acts of 2019\u2019s Edinburgh fringe, Fostekew made waves \u2013 and secured a Comedy award nomination \u2013 with her show Hench, about femininity and the muscular female body. Now touring, it\u2019s full of no-nonsense attitude and big-hitting set pieces about the dieting industry, childbirth and Fostekew\u2019s fraught relationship with her bolshy little boy. Soho theatre, London, 6-25 January. Then touring Trygve Wakenshaw The New Zealand comic with the name as twisty as his loose-limbed body was last seen on these shores performing a double act with his own baby son. Now, as part of the London international mime festival, he returns \u2013 in response to a challenge from his countryman Thom Monckton \u2013 with a pared-back solo show featuring just one performer, one technician, one light, no text and a stage of only 1m2. Soho theatre, London, 7-25 January Josie Long Josie Long\u2019s standup shows are the equivalent of open-heart surgery \u2013 with the benefit that it\u2019s her heart that\u2019s open, not yours. Through a lens of politics, love life or now family, they chronicle the ebbs and flows of Long\u2019s optimistic spirit \u2013 never more so than with Tender, her joyful latest about pregnancy and childbirth. It delighted Edinburgh audiences last summer, and now \u2013 with its blow-by-blow account of new motherhood and ruminations on child-rearing in an overheating world \u2013 it takes to the road. Warwick Arts Centre, 23 January. Then touring David Baddiel His last solo show My Family: Not the Sitcom was one for the ages, a comical but heartfelt account of his parents\u2019 eccentric lives that raised one\u2019s eyebrows to the back of one\u2019s neck and beyond. Now David Baddiel returns with a new one-man show, Trolls: Not the Dolls, about his adventures on the frontier of social media. It promises to be just as lurid. Grand Theatre Swansea, 24 January. Then touring Alexei Sayle It seems like only yesterday we were hailing Alexei Sayle\u2019s return to standup after 17 years away. In fact, it was seven years ago \u2013 and now he\u2019s touring again, for the first time since (give or take the odd festival gig). More \u201cdangerously political\u201d laughs are promised from the man who put the punk into alternative comedy \u2013 before settling down to host recent Radio 4 hit Alexei Sayle\u2019s Imaginary Sandwich Bar. HOME Manchester, 31 January-1 February. Then touring Anna and Helen Sometimes stoopid is exactly what you want from your comedy, and at such a time, Anna O\u2019Grady and Helen Cripps\u2019 Stuck in a Rat is precisely the ticket. The rookie duo made a splash on the fringe with this faux self-care seminar \u2013 the joke being that this summons to sort yourself out was delivered by two complete doofuses, barely able to keep their own show on the road. It\u2019s classic double act stuff, worth catching in February. 5-7 February, Vault festival, London Ahir Shah He made his name with heartfelt lefty cris de coeur as the country hit the reactionary skids. But in the last two years, the 28-year-old has inflected his emphatic standup with personal intimacies and spiritual doubt. In his compelling new show Dots, Shah considers the evaporation of his youthful certainties \u2013 albeit in the voice of a comic who still sounds ardent about everything. Cliffs Pavilion, Southend, 14 February. Then touring Dane Baptiste A few years ago, Dane Baptiste was a rising star of UK comedy, with a killer second show (Reasonable Doubts) and an acclaimed BBC sitcom (Sunny D) under his belt, alongside a burgeoning rep for radical commentary on race and politics. If he\u2019s yet fully to deliver on his ambition to be Britain\u2019s Chris Rock or Dave Chappelle \u2013 well, 2020 heralds another opportunity, as new show The Chocolate Chip tours the UK. South Street Arts Centre, Reading, 20 February. Then touring Rachel Parris If The Mash Report is the closest the UK has yet come to cultivating its own Daily Show, props are due to Rachel Parris, the smiling assassin whose sections on Trump, Piers Morgan and sexual harassment went viral, putting the show in the public eye. In 2020, Parris takes to the road with a new show, All Change Please, combining political satire with the tart musical comedy with which she originally made her name. Previews at Soho theatre, London, 2-4 March and the Old Market, Brighton, 24 April. Then touring Steve Martin and Martin Short You know them from TV and the movies: The Three Amigos, Father of the Bride. You may not know that Steve Martin and Martin Short are a jobbing comedy double act, Emmy-nominated for their Netflix special, and UK-bound. \u201cI like to think of this as among the funniest shows the audience has ever seen,\u201d says Martin, of a night that has variously been described as vaudeville and \u201ca children\u2019s show for adults\u201d, and which features solo standup, double-act larks, Martin on banjo and a live band. SSE Hydro, Glasgow, 9 March; Royal Albert Hall, London, 14-15 March \u2022 This article was amended on 3 January 2020 to correct a misnaming of the play The Book of Dust:La Belle Sauvage.",

A place of brilliance, resilience, yet asking now where is it?/ A place you\u2019d travel half the world for, but you hope you\u2019ll never visit.\u201d Walsh, who goes by the stage name Longfella, had been performing his poetry for 10 years before his powerful ode to Manchester was televised live to the world from Albert Square in the city, 24 hours after the Arena attack. Walsh, who himself overcame serious childhood illness, said: \u201cIt was a great honour to write and perform a piece for Royal Manchester children\u2019s hospital and it felt like one of the most important things I\u2019ve ever done. \u201cOver the months I met with families and staff and there were so many moving stories to inspire me as well as the huge sense of pride in the lifesaving work at the hospital.\u201d The specially commissioned film is to raise money for the Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital charity, which supports the families of the more than 276,000 young patients admitted to the hospital every year. Sarah Naismith, the charity\u2019s director, said: \u201cWhen we looked back over our 10 years it made us appreciate more than ever the vital work and the number of lives the hospital has touched. Tony, with his talent and personal connection, felt like the perfect partner to tell our story to the world.\u201d",

Peoples including the S\u00e1mi of Scandinavia\u2019s far north and the Inuit in Canada, Alaska and Greenland preserve ways of life superbly adapted to ice and cold. Their cultural creations include ingenious hunting and fishing gear, icebound legends and works of art. Their achievement has been to live in harmony with nature at its most extreme \u2013 but as climate change destabilises the Arctic, what will become of this extraordinary heritage?<br><em>British Museum, London, from 28 May</em></p> <h2>Heather Phillipson: The End</h2> <p>The maquette for The End, Phillipson\u2019s forthcoming commission for Trafalgar Square\u2019s fourth plinth, shows a gigantic ice-cream cone with a cherry on top. A fly climbs the swirl of ice-cream and there\u2019s a drone, ready for take off. It\u2019s a tawdry monument to national hubris, the feelgood factor turning sickly before our eyes. Phillipson\u2019s work churns with humour, autobiography, knockabout asides and a poet\u2019s sense of the unlikely and surprising conjunction. Then in June, the artist fills Tate Britain\u2019s Duveen galleries with the next Tate Britain commission.

Jan Svankmajer and Tim Burton are among the modern visionaries to have fallen down this rabbit hole. The V&amp;A isn\u2019t just showing the history of Alice, it\u2019s giving Carroll the Bowie or Pink Floyd treatment with an \u201cimmersive\u201d spectacular where you can ask Alice what the Dormouse said.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/alice-curiouser-and-curiouser\">V&amp;A</a>, London, 27 June to 10 January 2021</em></p> <h2>Liverpool Biennial 2020: The Stomach and the Port</h2> <p>Now in its 11th<sup> </sup>outing, the Liverpool Biennial thinks about the city and a wide range of interrelated exhibitions as a fluid organism that is continuously shaped by and shaping its environment. The curatorial premise talks about three entry points \u2013 the stomach, porosity and kin. Make of this what you can. Many of the art works include sound, shun direct representation, destabilise gender binaries or look at intense forms of contact. There will be dance, music, all kinds of interdisciplinary shenanigans from a roster of international artists.

One of his close friends as a boy in Aix grew up to be a geology professor and their conversations about rocks and fossils informed his understanding of landscape. His paintings of lonely sun-bleached stony hillsides and voids cut into the earth are among his most forceful, profound and unforgettable works.

By which I mean the 1990s, when shock and celebrity were everything. Politics, identity and social media matter more than elephant dung these days \u2013 or will that cliche about 21st-century British art be disrupted in turn by this latest instalment of the biggest and most ambitious survey of the scene?

Born in communist Yugoslavia in 1946, she insists in her early work on individual experience, including personal endangerment and pain \u2013 and this self-exposure is still the essence of her art even if the risk now is emotional rather than physical. A blazing star, and that\u2019s not just a reference to the one she lay in for a death-defying 1974 performance.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/marina-abramovic\">Royal Academy</a>, London, 26 September to 8 December</em></p> <h2>Jean Dubuffet</h2> <p>The first major UK exhibition of the French artist Jean Dubuffet (1901-1985) in over 50 years. Provocateur and founder of art brut, or raw art, Dubuffet began to collect what became known as \u201coutsider art\u201d in postwar Paris. One gallery focuses on Dubuffet\u2019s extensive collection of this. Immersed in French intellectual and artistic life, and in the waning idea of an avant garde, Dubuffet embraced the arbitrary and irrational. Using crude materials and working with an ironic rejection of skill and finesse belied his sophistication. A complex, fascinating man. <br><em>Barbican, London, 30 September to 17 January 2021</em></p> <h2>Ann Veronica Janssens: Hot Pink Turquoise</h2> <p>Visitors will be able to ride reflective-wheeled bikes round the main gallery of this extensive exhibition by the Folkestone-born artist, who works in Brussels. Janssens\u2019 immersive installations bathe viewers in light. Her ephemeral, perceptually arresting works often feature tinted fogs and densely coloured smoke. But there\u2019s more to her work than smoke and mirrors. Janssens can make light appear solid and make solids melt into air. This will be the first opportunity to experience the full range of her compelling and often joyous art. She tunes our eyes. <br><em>South London Gallery, September</em>.</p> <h2>Raphael</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9b1cc48b47ade859642730a4a09cda2582157cfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b1cc48b47ade859642730a4a09cda2582157cfc/80_0_2034_2541/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Madonna and Child with the Infant Baptist by Raphael.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beguiling \u2026 The Madonna and Child With the Infant Baptist by Raphael.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 National Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This good-looking as well as gifted Renaissance wonder died in 1520, at the age of 37, after exhausting himself with a night\u2019s arduous lovemaking \u2013 or so claimed his biographer Vasari, perhaps romanticising syphilis.

In an age of sculptural vapidity, Rodin rediscovered the expressive power of Michelangelo. His icons of passion and pain start in hell \u2013 all his famous statues evolved from the anguished swarming figures in his unfinished masterpiece The Gates of Hell. Out of this giant illustration of Dante\u2019s Inferno, he conceived The Thinker, The Kiss and his other visions of the agony and ecstasy of modern life.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/ey-exhibition-rodin\">Tate Modern</a>, London, 21 October to 21 February 2021</em></p> <h2>Nero</h2> <p>In our age of tinpot tyrants, prepare to meet their prototype. The Roman emperor Nero made people listen to his awful singing, killed Christians for fun and set Rome on fire - or so the historian Tacitus said. But did he exaggerate Nero\u2019s madness to prove his theory that absolute power absolutely corrupts?

His next frontier? The countryside. Almost a decade in the making, this ambitious research-driven exhibition promises to confound your every preconception about the great outdoors, tackling leisure, climate change, migration, rural preservation and digitised agriculture in a multifaceted portrait of the 98% of the Earth\u2019s surface not occupied by cities.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/countryside\">Guggenheim Museum</a>, New York, 20 February to 14 August</em></p> <h2>Congregation, exhibition by the Architecture Foundation</h2> <p>Staged in the newly refurbished crypt of St Mary Magdalene in Paddington, west London, this thoughtful exhibition will examine the way that social and economic pressures have changed the nature of faith spaces in the UK over the past decade.

That effortless creativity started with sticking newspapers on to early cubist canvases to invent collage and evolved into his own style of playful origami sculpture \u2013 yet he also found time to create some of the greatest etchings ever, including the wondrous Vollard Suite, with its minotaurs, bullfights and voluptuous lovers. Royal Academy, London, 25 January to 13 April Van Eyck: An Optical Revolution Ghent honours the greatest painter of the early northern Renaissance with numerous exhibitions and side-events, from the scholarly to the daft \u2013 including floral displays, themed food events, a Van Eyck shop, and even the Jan van Eyck Marathon. The main event however is Van Eyck: An Optical Revolution, featuring at least half of the known works by the artist and including the outer panels of Hubert and Van Eyck\u2019s astonishing Ghent Altarpiece, following six years of restoration, and also including more than 100 works by Van Eyck\u2019s contemporaries from across Europe. Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent, 1 February to 30 April Radical Figures By the end of the last century, painting had been buried but it turns out the funeral was premature. The young 21st-century artists exhuming its oily corpse in this survey include Michael Armitage, whose subtle, complex paintings draw on memories of Kenya, and Ryan Mosley, whose art is a grotesque Dada carnival of bulbous humanoid forms. This is figurative painting, but not as we know it. Whitechapel Gallery, London, 6 February to 10 May We Will Walk \u2013 Art and Resistance from the American South Bringing together artists, civil rights photographers, makers of quilts, guitars (one fashioned with wood from a hanging tree), assemblages, expansive archive material, music and much more besides, We Will Walk focuses on African-American artists from Alabama and the surrounding states. The work dates from the civil rights period and its aftermath to the present day and also features the work of contemporary artists and thinkers, including Kerry James Marshall and Angela Davis, who both migrated from Alabama. It is a story that isn\u2019t over, and not told enough. Turner Contemporary, Margate, 7 February to 3 May Steve McQueen In his film Hunger, perhaps his finest work, McQueen homes in on the dying, emaciated body of the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands in a way that evokes both Christian paintings of the passion and Sands\u2019s identification with them. It\u2019s typical of the way he brings high art into cinemas as well as film-making into the gallery. How will this retrospective capture the unique achievement of the only person to win both an Oscar and a Turner prize? Tate Modern, London, 13 February to 11 May Linderism Performance artist, zine maker, musician, documentary-photographer, Linder is known primarily for her post-punk Dadaist photomontages. This extensive show gives full reign to Linder\u2019s expanded practice. Using the Kettle\u2019s Yard Archive she will also evoke the elusive presence of Helen Ede, wife of Jim Ede, founder of Kettles\u2019s Yard. Staging interventions throughout Kettle\u2019s Yard and a new performance, at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge, Linder will shake things up. Kettle\u2019s Yard, Cambridge, 15 February to 16 April Aubrey Beardsley Victorian Britain\u2019s kinkiest reprobate gets a well-deserved airing of his refined and beautiful yet utterly sordid prints. Beardsley portrayed himself as a self-confessed \u201cmonster\u201d hiding in his four-poster bed and illustrated Lysistrata by Aristophanes with sumptuously pornographic images of bottoms. He also created a darkly beautiful illustrated edition of Oscar Wilde\u2019s Salome. This will be wicked. Tate Britain, London, 4 March to 25 May Among the Trees Tacita Dean\u2019s portraits of ancient yew trees in English churchyards, their branches propped up with crutches as their gnarled trunks send roots down the centuries, are among the most moving art works of our time. Her arboreal meditations are among the many reveries in this survey of contemporary art\u2019s relationship with trees. It starts with the arte povera movement that brought the forest into the gallery in the 1960s and brings us to the present with Peter Doig\u2019s painted firs and Anya Gallaccio\u2019s pastoral installations. Hayward Gallery, London, 4 March to 17 May Andy Warhol In his lifetime Warhol was dismissed as shallow but the further we get into a century he never lived to see, the more uncanny his insights into modern life appear. There are so many sides to his apparently simple pop art. The last Tate retrospective emphasised his dark view of America \u2013 this one discovers him as the forerunner of identity politics. He is our mirror, to quote his protege Lou Reed. Tate Modern, London, 12 March to 6 September Titian: Love, Desire, Death This once-in-a-lifetime exhibition reunites the greatest mythological paintings ever created \u2013 a cycle Titian called his \u201cpoesie\u201d in which the loves and transformations of the gods become subtle feasts of sensual paint and rich emotion. Venus begs Adonis to stay, Jupiter as a bull carries off Europa and Perseus rescues Andromeda in canvases that match the dramatic heights of Shakespeare (and that Shakespeare may have been influenced by). National Gallery, London, 16 March to 14 June Toyin Ojih Odutola The gallery becomes an outsized graphic novel in this Nigerian-American artist\u2019s first British show \u2013 but the story is far from straightforward. Powerfully delineated figures are lost in contemplative stillness. Line-drawn landscapes enfold their inaction in a mysterious limbo that could be a park or alien planet. These intense drawings illustrate a myth invented by Odutola herself. She believes drawing and writing have the same root. This is art as inspired daydream. Barbican Curve, London, 26 March to 26 July Artemisia Gentileschi The first feminist artist ever, born in Rome in 1593, gets her long-awaited due. Raped as a teenager by the painter Agostino Tassi, Gentileschi spent a lifetime fighting back. In her great canvas Judith Slaying Holofernes, two women hold a man down on his bed so they can cut his head off \u2013 he is her rapist. This and just about all her other paintings will be in this raw and bloody blockbuster. National Gallery, London, 4 April to 26 July Back to Earth To mark its 50th anniversary, the Serpentine Galleries have invited more than 50 leading artists, musicians, architects, poets, film-makers, scientists, thinkers and designers to propose artworks and projects in response to the climate emergency. Participants and collaborators include Brian Eno, Black Quantum Futurism collective, Judy Chicago, Olafur Eliasson, actor and activist Jane Fonda, indigenous Australian film collective Karrabing, Ed Ruscha, Tomas Sarraceno and many others. Imagining the future, the unthinkable and the possible, this promises to be a daunting, necessary show. Serpentine Galleries, London. Dates to be confirmed. Candice Breitz: Love Story Alec Baldwin and Julianne Moore bring a Hollywood touch to the plight of refugees by reading out their words. Wait \u2013 it\u2019s not as glib as it sounds. This installation by South African artist Breitz questions why we take celebrities more seriously than the suffering millions. Moore and Baldwin\u2019s polished performances are meant to send you to the second part of the show that gives migrants a direct voice. Tate Liverpool, 9 April to 7 June Ray Harryhausen No one forgets the myths and monsters this genius of art and cinema created. Harryhausen\u2019s animated masterpieces, from the army of skeletons in Jason and the Argonauts to Sinbad\u2019s swordfight with a Hindu goddess, have an imaginative power that lodges in your mind. He was equally at home creating flying saucers, giant crabs and Harpies. This blockbuster survey of his stop-motion menagerie should be a delight. Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, 23 May to 25 October Arctic: Culture and Climate The Arctic is not just a natural wonder but a human home. Peoples including the S\u00e1mi of Scandinavia\u2019s far north and the Inuit in Canada, Alaska and Greenland preserve ways of life superbly adapted to ice and cold. Their cultural creations include ingenious hunting and fishing gear, icebound legends and works of art. Their achievement has been to live in harmony with nature at its most extreme \u2013 but as climate change destabilises the Arctic, what will become of this extraordinary heritage? British Museum, London, from 28 May Heather Phillipson: The End The maquette for The End, Phillipson\u2019s forthcoming commission for Trafalgar Square\u2019s fourth plinth, shows a gigantic ice-cream cone with a cherry on top. A fly climbs the swirl of ice-cream and there\u2019s a drone, ready for take off. It\u2019s a tawdry monument to national hubris, the feelgood factor turning sickly before our eyes. Phillipson\u2019s work churns with humour, autobiography, knockabout asides and a poet\u2019s sense of the unlikely and surprising conjunction. Then in June, the artist fills Tate Britain\u2019s Duveen galleries with the next Tate Britain commission. What will she do? Trafalgar Square, London, March, and Tate Britain, London, 16 June to 18 October Sheila Hicks The Paris-based American artist has used weaving as the basis of her work for more than 50 years. Drawing on wildly different weaving traditions and indigenous textile practices, and working on both small woven drawings she creates on a hand-held frame and large scale installations that respond to the architecture of the gallery, this show follows major retrospectives in the US and Europe. Including more than 70 works, it promises to be as ravishing as it is overdue. The Hepworth is a perfect venue for her art. The Hepworth, Wakefield, 24 June to 7 October Alice: Curiouser and Curiouser Lewis Carroll\u2019s Victorian masterpiece of surreal nonsense has inspired art and cinema ever since Punch cartoonist Sir John Tenniel created its brilliant original illustrations with their solid renditions of the fantastic. Jan Svankmajer and Tim Burton are among the modern visionaries to have fallen down this rabbit hole. The V&amp;A isn\u2019t just showing the history of Alice, it\u2019s giving Carroll the Bowie or Pink Floyd treatment with an \u201cimmersive\u201d spectacular where you can ask Alice what the Dormouse said. V&amp;A, London, 27 June to 10 January 2021 Liverpool Biennial 2020: The Stomach and the Port Now in its 11th outing, the Liverpool Biennial thinks about the city and a wide range of interrelated exhibitions as a fluid organism that is continuously shaped by and shaping its environment. The curatorial premise talks about three entry points \u2013 the stomach, porosity and kin. Make of this what you can. Many of the art works include sound, shun direct representation, destabilise gender binaries or look at intense forms of contact. There will be dance, music, all kinds of interdisciplinary shenanigans from a roster of international artists. If you have the stomach, pass the port. Various venues, Liverpool, 11 July to 25 October C\u00e9zanne: The Rock and Quarry Paintings The craggy hard mind of Paul C\u00e9zanne found its mirror in the rugged rock formations of his native Provence. One of his close friends as a boy in Aix grew up to be a geology professor and their conversations about rocks and fossils informed his understanding of landscape. His paintings of lonely sun-bleached stony hillsides and voids cut into the earth are among his most forceful, profound and unforgettable works. This is where modern art begins. Royal Academy, London, 12 July to 18 October British Art Show 9 We\u2019ve come a long way from British art\u2019s past. By which I mean the 1990s, when shock and celebrity were everything. Politics, identity and social media matter more than elephant dung these days \u2013 or will that cliche about 21st-century British art be disrupted in turn by this latest instalment of the biggest and most ambitious survey of the scene? Kicking off in Manchester before touring, this promises to unveil a new creative generation and state of feeling. Manchester Art Gallery and the Whitworth, from September Marina Abramovi\u0107 The world\u2019s most charismatic performance artist has become part of 21st-century pop culture but here is a chance to explore the real story of Abramovi\u0107\u2019s art in a retrospective of her career. Born in communist Yugoslavia in 1946, she insists in her early work on individual experience, including personal endangerment and pain \u2013 and this self-exposure is still the essence of her art even if the risk now is emotional rather than physical. A blazing star, and that\u2019s not just a reference to the one she lay in for a death-defying 1974 performance. Royal Academy, London, 26 September to 8 December Jean Dubuffet The first major UK exhibition of the French artist Jean Dubuffet (1901-1985) in over 50 years. Provocateur and founder of art brut, or raw art, Dubuffet began to collect what became known as \u201coutsider art\u201d in postwar Paris. One gallery focuses on Dubuffet\u2019s extensive collection of this. Immersed in French intellectual and artistic life, and in the waning idea of an avant garde, Dubuffet embraced the arbitrary and irrational. Using crude materials and working with an ironic rejection of skill and finesse belied his sophistication. A complex, fascinating man. Barbican, London, 30 September to 17 January 2021 Ann Veronica Janssens: Hot Pink Turquoise Visitors will be able to ride reflective-wheeled bikes round the main gallery of this extensive exhibition by the Folkestone-born artist, who works in Brussels. Janssens\u2019 immersive installations bathe viewers in light. Her ephemeral, perceptually arresting works often feature tinted fogs and densely coloured smoke. But there\u2019s more to her work than smoke and mirrors. Janssens can make light appear solid and make solids melt into air. This will be the first opportunity to experience the full range of her compelling and often joyous art. She tunes our eyes. South London Gallery, September. Raphael This good-looking as well as gifted Renaissance wonder died in 1520, at the age of 37, after exhausting himself with a night\u2019s arduous lovemaking \u2013 or so claimed his biographer Vasari, perhaps romanticising syphilis. The National Gallery honours his 500th anniversary with a blockbuster survey of an artist who stands alongside Leonardo and Michelangelo at the apex of the canon, and whose art is just as beguiling as theirs when you surrender to its sweet harmonious musical beauty. National Gallery, London, 3 October to 24 January 2021 Bruce Nauman Possibly the most innovative, daring and influential of American artists. However familiar his art seems to be, he has constantly reinvented himself in his long career, always giving something new. Mending fences on the ranch, watching cats in the barn, evoking interrogations, domestic strife, slapstick and Samuel Beckett \u2013 they\u2019re all in there. Tate Modern, London, 6 October to 17 January 2021 Rodin This paradoxical 19th-century titan invented modern sculpture by returning to the Renaissance. In an age of sculptural vapidity, Rodin rediscovered the expressive power of Michelangelo. His icons of passion and pain start in hell \u2013 all his famous statues evolved from the anguished swarming figures in his unfinished masterpiece The Gates of Hell. Out of this giant illustration of Dante\u2019s Inferno, he conceived The Thinker, The Kiss and his other visions of the agony and ecstasy of modern life. Tate Modern, London, 21 October to 21 February 2021 Nero In our age of tinpot tyrants, prepare to meet their prototype. The Roman emperor Nero made people listen to his awful singing, killed Christians for fun and set Rome on fire - or so the historian Tacitus said. But did he exaggerate Nero\u2019s madness to prove his theory that absolute power absolutely corrupts? And will we get to see the booby-trapped boat with which Nero attempted to drown his mother Agrippina? British Museum, London, November Tracey Emin and Edvard Munch Emin is creating a colossal statue, The Mother, for the new Munch Museum (see below) that opens in Oslofjord in the spring. This exhibition explores their artistic intimacy. Her recent giant selfies showing her face exhausted by insomnia are homages to an insomniac Munch self-portrait, while her entire truth-telling confessional project emulates his terrifying honesty. Read our interview with Emin about the project. Royal Academy, London, 15 November to 28 February 2021 Architecture and design Countryside, the Future At the age of 75, the radical Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas is bored of the city. His next frontier? The countryside. Almost a decade in the making, this ambitious research-driven exhibition promises to confound your every preconception about the great outdoors, tackling leisure, climate change, migration, rural preservation and digitised agriculture in a multifaceted portrait of the 98% of the Earth\u2019s surface not occupied by cities. Guggenheim Museum, New York, 20 February to 14 August Congregation, exhibition by the Architecture Foundation Staged in the newly refurbished crypt of St Mary Magdalene in Paddington, west London, this thoughtful exhibition will examine the way that social and economic pressures have changed the nature of faith spaces in the UK over the past decade. It will feature 20 diverse projects, from the stunning new Cambridge Mosque, to a floating church designed to ply London\u2019s waterways, and a proposal for a Finchley synagogue with a striking geometric roof. From 22 February Academy Museum of Motion Pictures by Renzo Piano Standing as a great bulging sphere on Miracle Mile in Los Angeles, the new Academy Museum of Motion Pictures looks like an arrival from a Hollywood sci-fi movie. Designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano, it is an appropriate guise for what promises to be a dazzling new mecca for film buffs, bursting with movie memorabilia and offering a behind-the-scenes look into how films are made. Los Angeles, early 2020 Bags: Inside Out It might not sound like a Bowie-level blockbuster, but the V&amp;A\u2019s forthcoming foray into bags will delve deep into the duffle, probe the purse and scrutinise the sack, shining a spotlight into every velcro\u2019d pocket and zipped compartment of the ultimate accessory. From rucksacks to despatch boxes, Birkin bags to Louis Vuitton luggage, the exhibition will showcase 300 objects from the 16th century to today. V&amp;A, London, 25 April to 3 January 2021 Sneakers Unboxed: Studio to Street Can you tell your Air Jordans from your Air Force 1s? The Design Museum gets down with street style next year, with an exhibition that will track the influence of trainers from high-performance sportswear to cult objects and red carpet attire. It will look at how 3D-printing, self-lacing and recycled materials are changing footwear, and give visitors a chance to design their own pair of superfly kicks. Design Museum, London, 6 May to 6 September Munch Museum, Oslo, by Juan Herreros Housed in an enigmatic aluminium mesh tower that leans forward at the top, as if craning its neck out over Oslo\u2019s harbour, the new Munch Museum is a controversial new addition to the Norwegian capital\u2019s waterfront. The building will finally provide an adequate home for the collection of 28,000 paintings, sketches, photographs and sculptures that the artist bequeathed to the city, arranged over 13 floors, making it one of the largest museums in the world dedicated to a single artist. June (to be confirmed) Bee\u2019ah headquarters, Sharjah, by Zaha Hadid A rippling dune-like structure rising out of the desert in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, one of Zaha Hadid\u2019s last posthumous buildings will open next year. This lithe headquarters for the emirate\u2019s waste management company is one of her most futuristic works, billed as the world\u2019s first AI-powered office building. From visitor arrival to energy consumption, every aspect of the building\u2019s performance will be tracked by an omniscient digital brain. Summer (to be confirmed) Noel house and restaurant by Junya Ishigami Architect Junya Ishigami said his client asked for \u201csomething like a wine cellar\u201d, but the result couldn\u2019t be more strange. Burrowed into the ground, as if excavated by gigantic worms, this grotto-like residence and restaurant will be one of the most unusual buildings to open next year. Formed by digging a series of holes into the ground, casting concrete into the spaces, then carving out the earth beneath, it promises to be a gnarled, primitive place like no other. Yamaguchi, Japan, autumn Grand Egyptian Museum by Heneghan Peng Looking like something the pharaohs might have summoned into being, the Grand Egyptian Museum rises out of the landscape near the Great Pyramids as a chiselled, geometric form. Designed by Irish practice Heneghan Peng, the building is wrapped with a veil of translucent stone, covering a series of sunken halls that will contain almost four football pitches of permanent exhibition space, where the Tutankhamen collection will be displayed alongside innumerable other treasures. Giza, Egypt, October (to be confirmed) Taipei Performing Arts Centre, by OMA A veritable transformer of a building, the Taipei Performing Arts Centre will finally realise the architects\u2019 holy grail of a truly flexible and adaptable performance venue. It combines a 2,000-seat auditorium, a 1,500-seat theatre and a black box space, each of which can function separately and be combined into an enormous multi-sided events space, while a public loop meanders its way through the building, giving enticing backstage glimpses. Autumn (to be confirmed) Photography Visual Rights Including work from visual artists in Palestine and Israel as well as Britain, this show explores how images are used to manage people\u2019s ability to live or move freely, particularly in contested regions where the boundaries between civilian and military ways of seeing are constantly and intentionally blurred. Artists include Hagit Keysar, who experiments with aerial photography in Israel and Palestine, and Argentinian-born Miki Kratsman, who has documented the harshness of daily life in the Palestinian territories. Open Eye Gallery, Liverpool, 16 January to 22 March Wright Morris: The Home Place This underrated pioneer of the visual novel (fictional storytelling combined with photographs) travelled through the US in the immediate aftermath of the Great Depression, producing three books that form the basis of this show. Unlike more celebrated contemporaries like Walker Evans, Morris never made portraits, instead photographing everyday objects and landscapes to create a haunting depiction of human struggle and decline. Foam Amsterdam, 24 January to 5 April Haley Morris-Cafiero: The Bully Pulpit A provocative response to the often anonymous trolls who responded to Morris-Cafiero\u2019s work on social media. Following the publication of her previous series, The Watchers, she became the focus of a sustained wave of body-shaming. She has responded by dressing up like her most vociferous detractors, whom she tracked down online, and posing alongside representations of their most abusive comments. Selfies, but not as we know them. TJ Boulting, London, 13 February to 14 March Pieter Hugo: La Cucaracha Created in Mexico in 2018 and 2019, and named after a well-known Spanish folk song, La Cucaracha mixes arresting portraits and mysterious still-lifes made by the South African photographer on various visits to Mexico City, Oaxaca de Ju\u00e1rez, Juchit\u00e1n and Hermosillo. \u201cAlongside the flamboyance and high-pitched register of this series, there is the ordinariness of the everyday,\u201d Hugo has said. \u201cI am drawn to the fabulousness of the banal and the banality of the exotic.\u201d Huxley-Parlour, London, 18 February to 14 March Masculinities: Liberation Through Photography An ambitious and timely group exhibition exploring the changing nature of masculinity through the work of 50 artists. Addressing complex themes \u2013 patriarchy, power, queer identity, race, sexuality, class, fatherhood \u2013 it will show how photography and film have been crucial in shaping masculinity in its many forms. Includes work by Richard Avedon, Peter Hujar and Annette Messager. Barbican, London, 20 February to 17 May Cecil Beaton\u2019s Bright Young Things \u201cArt without snobbery didn\u2019t interest him,\u201d said Tom Wolfe of Beaton, making it a tricky moment to celebrate this photographer. This exhibition of portraits of the famous and the privileged of the 1920s will do nothing to sway sceptics. Expect glamour aplenty, though, and a cast of characters that includes socialites (Diana Mitford), film stars (Tallulah Bankhead) and the supposedly brightest of the \u201cbright young things\u201d (Stephen Tennant). National Portrait Gallery, London, 12 March to 7 June Zanele Muholi Tate Modern hosts the first major survey of the work of Zanele Muholi, the photographer-activist whose massive archive of South African black lesbian and trans people, Faces and Phases, is one of contemporary photography\u2019s great documentary projects. The exhibition will also include a more recent series of dramatic self-portraits, Somnyama Ngonyama (Hail the Dark Lioness). Tate Modern, London, 29 April to 18 October Don McCullin Having drawn huge crowds to Tate Britain in 2019, this retrospective of the revered war photographer opens in Liverpool this summer. Alongside his iconic images from the Vietnam war and famine-stricken Biafra, the show will also include an added selection of photographs depicting everyday life and the industrial landscapes of northern towns and cities during the 1960s and 70s. Among the wealth of ephemera is his Nikon camera that was struck by a bullet in Cambodia. Tate Liverpool, 5 June to 27 September Britain &amp; Photography: 1945-79 Spanning the years between the end of the second world war and the election of Margaret Thatcher, this exhibition maps out a defining period for British photojournalism and documentary photography. It will include iconic images by the likes of Bert Hardy, Lee Miller, Bill Brandt, Henri Cartier-Bresson and Don McCullin. An intriguing visual portrait of another Britain, both familiar and impossibly distant. Tate Britain, London, 30 June to 27 September Helen Levitt One of the greatest American street photographers, Helen Levitt began shooting in New York in the 1930s. Her work is quieter and more socially aware than that of the mainly male counterparts who followed in her wake, with children appearing often in her photographs. Her colour tones are richly hued and her eye for gesture second to none, bodies crouching or stretching in a wonderful choreography of the commonplace. The exhibition includes many rarely seen images and short films. The Photographers\u2019 Gallery, London, 10 July to 11 October",

      "body": "<p>\u2018Munch\u2019s mother died when he was very young,\u201d says Tracey Emin. \u201cSo I want to give him a mother.\u201d And what a mother she is giving him. The artist\u2019s nine-metre bronze colossus will be unveiled in 2020, at the new Munch Museum in Oslo harbour. Emin has been fascinated by Edvard Munch\u2019s brokenhearted art all her life. Now her giant Mother will be a permanent feature of the fjord he so famously depicted under a blood red sky in The Scream.</p> <p>Yet this monumental image of a naked woman kneeling and hunched over an invisible child began as a small, fragile, handmade object. \u201cIt started off with me playing with clay,\u201d says Emin, who didn\u2019t think she had a chance when she entered the international competition to find a public artwork for Oslo\u2019s Museum Island. Other candidates included the acclaimed Scandinavian artists Olafur Eliasson and Ragnar Kjartansson. But intimacy won.</p> <p>\u201cI put in the little maquette and then watercolours of her on the island, and all the technical stuff. Apparently when they opened it up and took it out of the box, they fell in love with it. You can see that she\u2019s old. My answer to that is, \u2018Haven\u2019t you ever loved someone who is old?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f9537caa79564b555aea36f318b672f8321ca14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f9537caa79564b555aea36f318b672f8321ca14/0_1210_5504_4562/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The stunning Munchmuseet, Oslo, designed by estudio Herreros, which opens in spring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"829\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The stunning Munchmuseet, Oslo, designed by estudio Herreros, which opens in spring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivar Kvaal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why turn this delicate creation into a nine-metre monument? Well, Emin has been experimenting with scale since 2016, when she made digitally printed enlargements of little figures she shaped in clay. When I saw the first results, in white plasticky material in her studio, the effect was startling \u2013 because her thumb and finger marks were enlarged too, perforating and scarring the statue. Before this she wasn\u2019t much interested in big art. Her (rejected) proposal for Trafalgar Square\u2019s fourth plinth was a family of little meerkats.</p> <p>So why go huge? \u201cOne reason is being close to Louise Bourgeois and seeing how she could go from small to giant. You can\u2019t just make anything big \u2013 it was about finding the right form.\u201d</p> <p>Now Mother is making the journey from maquette to 15 tonnes of bronze. \u201cIt\u2019s being sand-cast in Stoke-on-Trent by the Westley Group,\u201d says Emin. \u201cThey do submarines and stuff like that. It\u2019s being made in 97 separate pieces, then they will be welded together in three sections and shipped to Oslo in giant cargo ships.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a58a2aee298ea9b1c62187e5b1a8bf0539ece205\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a58a2aee298ea9b1c62187e5b1a8bf0539ece205/10_0_4792_5987/800.jpg\" alt=\"Munch\u2019s The Scream.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Munch\u2019s The Scream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The original setting for the statue was \u201ca sort of rocky terrain\u201d. But Emin, a keen gardener and vegetable grower, has persuaded the funders to create a green environment instead.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Munch\u2019s mother died when he was very young,\u201d says Tracey Emin. \u201cSo I want to give him a mother.\u201d And what a mother she is giving him. The artist\u2019s nine-metre bronze colossus will be unveiled in 2020, at the new Munch Museum in Oslo harbour. Emin has been fascinated by Edvard Munch\u2019s brokenhearted art all her life. Now her giant Mother will be a permanent feature of the fjord he so famously depicted under a blood red sky in The Scream. Yet this monumental image of a naked woman kneeling and hunched over an invisible child began as a small, fragile, handmade object. \u201cIt started off with me playing with clay,\u201d says Emin, who didn\u2019t think she had a chance when she entered the international competition to find a public artwork for Oslo\u2019s Museum Island. Other candidates included the acclaimed Scandinavian artists Olafur Eliasson and Ragnar Kjartansson. But intimacy won. \u201cI put in the little maquette and then watercolours of her on the island, and all the technical stuff. Apparently when they opened it up and took it out of the box, they fell in love with it. You can see that she\u2019s old. My answer to that is, \u2018Haven\u2019t you ever loved someone who is old?\u2019\u201d Why turn this delicate creation into a nine-metre monument? Well, Emin has been experimenting with scale since 2016, when she made digitally printed enlargements of little figures she shaped in clay. When I saw the first results, in white plasticky material in her studio, the effect was startling \u2013 because her thumb and finger marks were enlarged too, perforating and scarring the statue. Before this she wasn\u2019t much interested in big art. Her (rejected) proposal for Trafalgar Square\u2019s fourth plinth was a family of little meerkats. So why go huge? \u201cOne reason is being close to Louise Bourgeois and seeing how she could go from small to giant. You can\u2019t just make anything big \u2013 it was about finding the right form.\u201d Now Mother is making the journey from maquette to 15 tonnes of bronze. \u201cIt\u2019s being sand-cast in Stoke-on-Trent by the Westley Group,\u201d says Emin. \u201cThey do submarines and stuff like that. It\u2019s being made in 97 separate pieces, then they will be welded together in three sections and shipped to Oslo in giant cargo ships.\u201d The original setting for the statue was \u201ca sort of rocky terrain\u201d. But Emin, a keen gardener and vegetable grower, has persuaded the funders to create a green environment instead. People won\u2019t just be able to use the little park, she says: \u201cThey can go swimming from it as well. The Mother will welcome ships and protect everybody. She looks quite strong but also loving.\u201d Emin had already been commissioned to show her art alongside Munch\u2019s in the new museum\u2019s opening exhibition in spring, which will tour to the Royal Academy in London. Her attempt to give Munch back the mother he lost is the culmination of a lifetime\u2019s love affair with the artist who found new ways to symbolise emotion. His paintings are stains of loss, grief and isolation. \u201cMunch\u2019s my favourite artist in the whole world. He\u2019s gentle, he\u2019s emotional and he\u2019s just a really, really fantastic painter. He was spiritual, poetic, very very handsome. And he worked really hard.\u201d She has one other intriguing detail to add about the father of modern expressionism: \u201cHe was one of the first Norwegians to have a telephone.\u201d To create her double homage, the show and statue, Emin immersed herself in the life of Munch, who spent most of his time in Oslo. He died there in 1944, and the city is now setting out to celebrate him more then ever. \u201cI\u2019ve had full access to the Munch archive,\u201d says Emin. \u201cEven his hats.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>US author Kiley Reid offers a refreshing take on an age-old question: can we connect across barriers of race, gender, wealth and privilege? Emira Tucker, who works in Philadelphia as a babysitter for news anchor Peter and lifestyle guru Alix, takes their toddler, Briar, to an upscale supermarket where suspicions are stirred because she is black and the child is white. The security guard accuses her of kidnapping, and is only appeased when Emira calls Peter. (Peter is \u201can old white guy\u201d, she declares, \u201cso I\u2019m sure everyone will feel better\u201d.) A lesser novel would have lingered here, in territory that\u2019s painfully familiar from countless viral incidents. But in Reid\u2019s debut the incident heralds a caustically funny skewering of the sort of well-intentioned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/racial-inequality-niceness-white-people\" title=\"\">liberal who congratulates themselves on having black guests</a> at dinner.</p> <p>The story toggles between Emira, offbeat, aimless and fresh out of college, and Alix, wealthy overseer of a woman-centric brand built on her knack for getting free merchandise by writing letters. Alix and Peter\u2019s house gets egged after Peter blunders into a mortifying episode of on-air racism \u2013 while covering the story of a black boy inviting a white girl to prom, he blurts: \u201cLet\u2019s hope that last one asked her father first.\u201d In the wake of her husband\u2019s racist faux pas, Alix resolves to befriend her black babysitter: \u201cto wake the fuck up \u2026 To get to know Emira Tucker.\u201d This desire intensifies until it begins to seem like a kind of neurosis, leaving her in thrall to feelings that aren\u2019t \u201ccompletely unlike a crush\u201d. She spies on the lock screen of Emira\u2019s phone (\u201calways filled with information that was youthful, revealing, and completely addicting\u201d), traps her at the kitchen table for awkward chats and begs her to join the family for Thanksgiving, with disastrous results.</p> <p>When Emira starts dating Kelley, a white man who films the supermarket incident on his phone, we detect a similarly disconcerting earnestness. What threatens to scupper the relationship isn\u2019t the racial divide but Kelley\u2019s racial tourism. His keenness tips the scales suspiciously towards fetishisation: he\u2019s \u201clike that one white guy at every black wedding who\u2019s, like, super-hyped to do the Cupid Shuffle\u201d. He only dates black women, and seems to have exclusively black friends. Alix opines that Kelley surrounds \u201chimself with black people just so he can feel good about himself\u201d, failing entirely to recognise herself in the mirror of her own remark. One of the novel\u2019s deep ironies is that the white people in Emira\u2019s life are more fixated on race than she is. Like many a young person drifting between part-time jobs, she\u2019s most consumed by angst about what the hell she\u2019s doing with her life. The supermarket incident prompts not anger but wry self-reflection: \u201cmore than the racial bias, the night \u2026 came back to her with a nauseating surge and a resounding declaration that hissed, <em>You don\u2019t have a real job</em>.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Kelley is 'like that one white guy at every black wedding who\u2019s, like, super-hyped to do the Cupid Shuffle'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The illuminating examination of Emira\u2019s inner life, the deep anxiety of a young woman whose life choices are dictated by the demands of rent and health insurance, gives the novel the flavour of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/aug/17/american-coming-of-age-novels\" title=\"\">bildungsroman</a>. However, this is juxtaposed with Alix and Kelley\u2019s objectifying emphasis on her race and failure to see her as a full person, because of their quixotic, guilt-driven overcompensation. Conversations are failures in communication. Each talks at Emira, but never really listens, manufacturing an idea of her that fits their own projections. Language styles of toddlers, yummy mummies and Emira\u2019s homegirls are captured pitch-perfectly in the novel while true understanding flickers always out of reach. Emira constantly has to explain things that with her group of black female friends can go blessedly unspoken. In one scene, her frustration with Kelley spills over: \u201cI need you to get that like \u2026 being angry and yelling in a store means something different for me than it would for you.\u201d It\u2019s not opacity of vocabulary or vernacular that renders us so impenetrable to one another, the novel suggests, but rather our unwillingness to pay attention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/racial-inequality-niceness-white-people\">White people assume niceness is the answer to racial inequality. It's not | Robin diAngelo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet to call this a novel about race would be to diminish its considerable powers, just as to focus on race alone is to diminish a human being. It skillfully interweaves race-related explorations with astute musings on friendship, motherhood, marriage, love and more, underlining that there\u2019s so much more to us than skin. This is the calling card of a virtuoso talent, a thrilling millennial spin on the 19th-century novel of manners that may call to mind another recent literary sensation.

Alix and Peter\u2019s house gets egged after Peter blunders into a mortifying episode of on-air racism \u2013 while covering the story of a black boy inviting a white girl to prom, he blurts: \u201cLet\u2019s hope that last one asked her father first.\u201d In the wake of her husband\u2019s racist faux pas, Alix resolves to befriend her black babysitter: \u201cto wake the fuck up \u2026 To get to know Emira Tucker.\u201d This desire intensifies until it begins to seem like a kind of neurosis, leaving her in thrall to feelings that aren\u2019t \u201ccompletely unlike a crush\u201d. She spies on the lock screen of Emira\u2019s phone (\u201calways filled with information that was youthful, revealing, and completely addicting\u201d), traps her at the kitchen table for awkward chats and begs her to join the family for Thanksgiving, with disastrous results. When Emira starts dating Kelley, a white man who films the supermarket incident on his phone, we detect a similarly disconcerting earnestness. What threatens to scupper the relationship isn\u2019t the racial divide but Kelley\u2019s racial tourism. His keenness tips the scales suspiciously towards fetishisation: he\u2019s \u201clike that one white guy at every black wedding who\u2019s, like, super-hyped to do the Cupid Shuffle\u201d. He only dates black women, and seems to have exclusively black friends. Alix opines that Kelley surrounds \u201chimself with black people just so he can feel good about himself\u201d, failing entirely to recognise herself in the mirror of her own remark. One of the novel\u2019s deep ironies is that the white people in Emira\u2019s life are more fixated on race than she is. Like many a young person drifting between part-time jobs, she\u2019s most consumed by angst about what the hell she\u2019s doing with her life. The supermarket incident prompts not anger but wry self-reflection: \u201cmore than the racial bias, the night \u2026 came back to her with a nauseating surge and a resounding declaration that hissed, You don\u2019t have a real job.\u201d The illuminating examination of Emira\u2019s inner life, the deep anxiety of a young woman whose life choices are dictated by the demands of rent and health insurance, gives the novel the flavour of a bildungsroman. However, this is juxtaposed with Alix and Kelley\u2019s objectifying emphasis on her race and failure to see her as a full person, because of their quixotic, guilt-driven overcompensation. Conversations are failures in communication. Each talks at Emira, but never really listens, manufacturing an idea of her that fits their own projections. Language styles of toddlers, yummy mummies and Emira\u2019s homegirls are captured pitch-perfectly in the novel while true understanding flickers always out of reach. Emira constantly has to explain things that with her group of black female friends can go blessedly unspoken. In one scene, her frustration with Kelley spills over: \u201cI need you to get that like \u2026 being angry and yelling in a store means something different for me than it would for you.\u201d It\u2019s not opacity of vocabulary or vernacular that renders us so impenetrable to one another, the novel suggests, but rather our unwillingness to pay attention. Yet to call this a novel about race would be to diminish its considerable powers, just as to focus on race alone is to diminish a human being. It skillfully interweaves race-related explorations with astute musings on friendship, motherhood, marriage, love and more, underlining that there\u2019s so much more to us than skin. This is the calling card of a virtuoso talent, a thrilling millennial spin on the 19th-century novel of manners that may call to mind another recent literary sensation. I had thought of ending this review by predicting that Reid may be the next Sally Rooney. But Such a Fun Age is so fresh and essential that I predict instead that next year we\u2019ll be anxiously awaiting the next Kiley Reid. \u2022 Sara Collins\u2019s The Confessions of Frannie Langton is published by Penguin.

For the moment, that may indeed be true. Yet as long ago as 1990, the German ornithologist and migration expert <a href=\"https://www.orn.mpg.de/589467/Prof_Dr_Peter_Berthold\">Peter Berthold</a> warned that during the initial warming period many bird species would benefit from \u201cheavenly conditions\u201d. This, he explained, was a kind of honeymoon period in which warmer springs and summers, and milder winters, would allow them to expand their numbers and range.</p> <p>But if the global climate becomes hotter still, with more frequent and extreme weather events such as droughts, storms and floods, reality will inevitably begin to bite, and all but the most adaptable species will start to decline. Their fall might also be hastened by an increase in populations of parasites and diseases, which flourish in warmer climates.</p> <p>Ironically, the long-tailed blue butterfly I watched sunning itself in August cannot survive Britain\u2019s winters \u2013 at least not yet. As Neil Hulme explains, it would need a rise in average temperatures of several degrees, enough to banish winter frosts that kill their larvae, to colonise Britain permanently. But if that did happen, we would have reached a climatic tipping point, and probably lose not just much of our wildlife, but even jeopardise our own long-term existence on the planet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a0ad5caea21b91bd2afa0777d10b4a58ccaaaa20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0ad5caea21b91bd2afa0777d10b4a58ccaaaa20/0_0_1500_2000/750.jpg\" alt=\"Long-tailed blue underside\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The underside of a long-tailed blue butterfly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hulme/Butterfly Conservation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rapid environmental change is likely to hit some creatures harder than others. On a recent edition of the Radio 4 series The Life Scientific, Professor Anne Magurran of St Andrews University talked about what she calls \u201cthe shopping mall effect\u201d. She noted that wherever you go in the world nowadays, from London to Los Angeles, Madrid to Melbourne, shopping centres tend to have the same outlets \u2013 well-known international brands whose names we all recognise.</p> <p>Likewise, in response to a panoply of environmental pressures, ecosystems are tending to become more homogenous, with a few highly adaptable species beginning to dominate to the exclusion of less successful ones. As Magurran warns, if environmental conditions become more and more extreme, homogenisation will start to occur, and there will inevitably be species loss.</p> <p>However, as Magurran points out, there is still time for us to take action to help safeguard the earth\u2019s biodiversity. At the moment, she says, the dominant signal is change rather than loss. But unless we take swift and decisive action to mitigate climate change, while at the same time preventing habitat destruction, the rate of extinction will start to accelerate. Given that many governments appear to be heading in the opposite direction, with increased deregulation and a weakening of environmental protection back on the agenda, this is a very real concern. If we fail to act, the consequences for Britain\u2019s wildlife are that successful generalists will do well, while specialists will not.</p> <p>When it comes to making predictions, we also need to take into account the unusual nature of the British Isles, which stretch from Shetland, just a few degrees of latitude short of the Arctic Circle, to Scilly, which has its own \u2013 almost subtropical \u2013 microclimate.</p> <p>So, while we enjoy the short-term benefits of climate change in the south, problems are already beginning to occur at the other end of Britain. On the Cairngorm plateau, our sole example of the arctic-alpine biome, the ptarmigan \u2013 the only British bird that turns white in winter \u2013 is gradually declining, with just a few thousand pairs remaining.</p> <p>Until the start of the 19th century, the ptarmigan could be found across a wide swathe of northern Britain, south to the Lake District; but today it survives only in the Highlands. Its decline has been caused by a number of factors, including crows attracted by the rubbish left by visitors, which prey on the ptarmigan\u2019s eggs and chicks. But a more long-term factor is the warming climate, which is altering the habitat and food supply of these highly specialised birds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4dfd92339892788112916416b01e7ae24078de30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dfd92339892788112916416b01e7ae24078de30/0_0_4016_2681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ptarmigan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Only a few thousand ptarmigans remain in the Highlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christoph Ruisz/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Should the climate emergency continue to worsen, and temperatures keep rising, the ptarmigan \u2013 along with other highland specialists such as the dotterel and snow bunting \u2013 looks set to disappear as a British bird in my lifetime.</p> <p>I recall many years ago hearing someone talk about saving the planet \u201cfor our children, and our children\u2019s children\u201d. At the time, this felt like an abstract notion; even a rather sanctimonious platitude. Now that I have children and step-grandchildren of my own, who may well live to witness the 22nd century, that phrase feels far more relevant and urgent. If the worst predictions for the climate emergency come true, with devastating consequences for human and animal life on this planet, then I do not envy them living that long.</p> <p>So, much as I enjoy seeing cattle egrets on my local patch, or catching up with a new species of butterfly on the south coast, my pleasure is more than ever tinged with concern.</p> <p>My fear is that these pioneering colonists are not something to be celebrated, but a phenomenon to warn us of impending disaster in this new age of extinction.</p> <p>\u2022 Stephen Moss is a naturalist and author based in Somerset, where he is president of the Somerset Wildlife Trust; he also runs an MA in travel and nature writing at Bath Spa University</p>",

On a recent edition of the Radio 4 series The Life Scientific, Professor Anne Magurran of St Andrews University talked about what she calls \u201cthe shopping mall effect\u201d. She noted that wherever you go in the world nowadays, from London to Los Angeles, Madrid to Melbourne, shopping centres tend to have the same outlets \u2013 well-known international brands whose names we all recognise. Likewise, in response to a panoply of environmental pressures, ecosystems are tending to become more homogenous, with a few highly adaptable species beginning to dominate to the exclusion of less successful ones. As Magurran warns, if environmental conditions become more and more extreme, homogenisation will start to occur, and there will inevitably be species loss. However, as Magurran points out, there is still time for us to take action to help safeguard the earth\u2019s biodiversity. At the moment, she says, the dominant signal is change rather than loss. But unless we take swift and decisive action to mitigate climate change, while at the same time preventing habitat destruction, the rate of extinction will start to accelerate. Given that many governments appear to be heading in the opposite direction, with increased deregulation and a weakening of environmental protection back on the agenda, this is a very real concern. If we fail to act, the consequences for Britain\u2019s wildlife are that successful generalists will do well, while specialists will not. When it comes to making predictions, we also need to take into account the unusual nature of the British Isles, which stretch from Shetland, just a few degrees of latitude short of the Arctic Circle, to Scilly, which has its own \u2013 almost subtropical \u2013 microclimate. So, while we enjoy the short-term benefits of climate change in the south, problems are already beginning to occur at the other end of Britain. On the Cairngorm plateau, our sole example of the arctic-alpine biome, the ptarmigan \u2013 the only British bird that turns white in winter \u2013 is gradually declining, with just a few thousand pairs remaining. Until the start of the 19th century, the ptarmigan could be found across a wide swathe of northern Britain, south to the Lake District; but today it survives only in the Highlands. Its decline has been caused by a number of factors, including crows attracted by the rubbish left by visitors, which prey on the ptarmigan\u2019s eggs and chicks. But a more long-term factor is the warming climate, which is altering the habitat and food supply of these highly specialised birds. Should the climate emergency continue to worsen, and temperatures keep rising, the ptarmigan \u2013 along with other highland specialists such as the dotterel and snow bunting \u2013 looks set to disappear as a British bird in my lifetime. I recall many years ago hearing someone talk about saving the planet \u201cfor our children, and our children\u2019s children\u201d. At the time, this felt like an abstract notion; even a rather sanctimonious platitude. Now that I have children and step-grandchildren of my own, who may well live to witness the 22nd century, that phrase feels far more relevant and urgent. If the worst predictions for the climate emergency come true, with devastating consequences for human and animal life on this planet, then I do not envy them living that long. So, much as I enjoy seeing cattle egrets on my local patch, or catching up with a new species of butterfly on the south coast, my pleasure is more than ever tinged with concern. My fear is that these pioneering colonists are not something to be celebrated, but a phenomenon to warn us of impending disaster in this new age of extinction. \u2022 Stephen Moss is a naturalist and author based in Somerset, where he is president of the Somerset Wildlife Trust; he also runs an MA in travel and nature writing at Bath Spa University",

      "body": "<p>Prior to this bushfire season, a state of emergency had only been called four times in New South Wales since 2006, despite <a href=\"https://www.disasterassist.gov.au/Pages/australian-disasters.aspx\">hundreds of events being registered by the Australian government as \u201cdisasters\u201d</a> in the last decade alone.</p> \n<p>On 11 November last year, the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, called a state of emergency for the first time since 2013. The declaration was valid for seven days. A second state of emergency was called for a week beginning on 19 December, with the premier\u2019s office citing \u201cthe most devastating bushfire season in living memory\u201d. On 2 January, the premier called yet another state of emergency \u2013 the third for this fire season \u2013 to begin on Friday.</p> \n<p>So what governs the decision to call a state of emergency, and what powers does the state premier assume in calling one?</p> \n<h2>The powers</h2> \n<p>State emergency legislation varies from state to state. In NSW, a state of emergency is declared <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/searma1989331/\">under the State Emergency and Rescue Management Act of 1989</a> and can be done so when the premier believes there is \u201ca significant and widespread danger to life or property in New South Wales\u201d.</p> \n<p>The declaration triggers a broad range of measures. On Thursday, Berejiklian drew attention to the powers that the declaration gives emergency services to close and open roads at will, and forcibly evacuate members of the public, citing extreme high temperatures forecast for Saturday and the high volume of traffic due to tourist movement.</p> \n<p>A state of emergency declaration also allows the Rural Fire Service commissioner to exercise powers usually unavailable to them. In December, the premier\u2019s office said these powers would enable RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>direct any government agency to conduct or refrain from conducting its functions;</p></li> \n <li><p>control and coordinate the allocation of government resources;</p></li> \n <li><p>evacuate people from property within the declared area;</p></li> \n <li><p>close roads and thoroughfares to traffic;</p></li> \n <li><p>pull down or shore up infrastructure at risk of collapse;</p></li> \n <li><p>order the shutdown of essential utilities in the declared area including electricity, gas, oil, water;</p></li> \n <li><p>enter or take possession of property in the course of the emergency response.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/searma1989331/s40.html\">It is an offence</a> to obstruct emergency personnel.</p> \n<p>In announcing the third state of emergency, Berejiklian said: \u201cWe don\u2019t take these decisions lightly but we also want to make sure we\u2019re taking every single precaution to be prepared for what could be a horrible day on Saturday.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Why is a state of emergency called?</h2> \n<p>Officially declared \u201cdisasters\u201d can include bushfires, floods, cyclones and the like, as well as influenza outbreaks and terrorist acts.</p> \n<p>Other states of emergency called since 2006 include the Queensland floods and the NSW floods in 2012. The 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria did not result in a state of emergency being called.</p> \n<p>When the state of emergency was called in response to the bushfires in NSW in October 2013, Prof Jim McLennan, an expert in emergency management and decision making at La Trobe University, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/22/australian-bushfires-state-of-emergency-explained\">told Guardian Australia</a> that both the severity of the disaster and the length of time it was expected to last were both factors taken into consideration when making the call.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost emergency response facilities are set up for a 24- to 48-hour sort of situation,\u201d he said. \u201cExtraordinary powers are judged to be needed, for road closures, restriction of areas to members of the public \u2013 those kinds of things which over an extended period of time have to be managed rather than left to the judgment of citizens.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Prior to this bushfire season, a state of emergency had only been called four times in New South Wales since 2006, despite hundreds of events being registered by the Australian government as \u201cdisasters\u201d in the last decade alone. On 11 November last year, the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, called a state of emergency for the first time since 2013. The declaration was valid for seven days. A second state of emergency was called for a week beginning on 19 December, with the premier\u2019s office citing \u201cthe most devastating bushfire season in living memory\u201d. On 2 January, the premier called yet another state of emergency \u2013 the third for this fire season \u2013 to begin on Friday. So what governs the decision to call a state of emergency, and what powers does the state premier assume in calling one? The powers State emergency legislation varies from state to state. In NSW, a state of emergency is declared under the State Emergency and Rescue Management Act of 1989 and can be done so when the premier believes there is \u201ca significant and widespread danger to life or property in New South Wales\u201d. The declaration triggers a broad range of measures. On Thursday, Berejiklian drew attention to the powers that the declaration gives emergency services to close and open roads at will, and forcibly evacuate members of the public, citing extreme high temperatures forecast for Saturday and the high volume of traffic due to tourist movement. A state of emergency declaration also allows the Rural Fire Service commissioner to exercise powers usually unavailable to them. In December, the premier\u2019s office said these powers would enable RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons to: direct any government agency to conduct or refrain from conducting its functions; control and coordinate the allocation of government resources; evacuate people from property within the declared area; close roads and thoroughfares to traffic; pull down or shore up infrastructure at risk of collapse; order the shutdown of essential utilities in the declared area including electricity, gas, oil, water; enter or take possession of property in the course of the emergency response. It is an offence to obstruct emergency personnel. In announcing the third state of emergency, Berejiklian said: \u201cWe don\u2019t take these decisions lightly but we also want to make sure we\u2019re taking every single precaution to be prepared for what could be a horrible day on Saturday.\u201d Why is a state of emergency called? Officially declared \u201cdisasters\u201d can include bushfires, floods, cyclones and the like, as well as influenza outbreaks and terrorist acts. Other states of emergency called since 2006 include the Queensland floods and the NSW floods in 2012. The 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria did not result in a state of emergency being called. When the state of emergency was called in response to the bushfires in NSW in October 2013, Prof Jim McLennan, an expert in emergency management and decision making at La Trobe University, told Guardian Australia that both the severity of the disaster and the length of time it was expected to last were both factors taken into consideration when making the call. \u201cMost emergency response facilities are set up for a 24- to 48-hour sort of situation,\u201d he said. \u201cExtraordinary powers are judged to be needed, for road closures, restriction of areas to members of the public \u2013 those kinds of things which over an extended period of time have to be managed rather than left to the judgment of citizens.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Politicians and climate change activists around the globe have expressed horror at the unfolding Australian bushfire crisis, saying the devastation is an urgent reminder of the climate emergency. Former US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton said the fires \u2013 which began during Australia\u2019s hottest ever year \u2013 left no room to question the effects of climate change. \u201cWith Australia on fire and the Arctic in meltdown, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re in a climate emergency,\u201d Clinton said, going on to detail her support for the Earthshot prize, described by Sir David Attenborough as \u201cthe most prestigious environment prize in history\u201d. Bernie Sanders, in the race to become the Democrats\u2019 US presidential nominee, said the scenes in Australia would become \u201cincreasingly common around the world\u201d and issued a call to action. \u201cWhat is happening in Australia today will become increasingly common around the world if we do not aggressively combat climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuels. The future of the planet is at stake. We must act.\u201d Author Naomi Wolf shared a message from an Australian father who had been trapped by the bushfires to the prime minister, Scott Morrison. The message read: \u201cHey @ScottMorrisonMP, my family and I got out of Mallacoota just before the road closed and spent four days stranded in NSW by the #climatefires. I can assure you the cricket being on provided zero solace. I hope you\u2019re good at other things because you\u2019re a useless Prime Minister.\u201d Morrison has been heavily criticised for deflecting any talk of climate change policy during the bushfire crisis. On Thursday, he accepted a link between reducing emissions and protecting the environment but said the government\u2019s climate policies were adequate. Greta Thunberg, Time magazine\u2019s 2019 person of the year, has shared coverage of the mass evacuations taking place and video of the devastation under the hashtag #Thisisfine. The fires have been covered extensively by media around the world, from the Wall Street Journal (\u201c\u2018We Were Freaking Out.\u2019 Terrifying Fire Season Takes a Bad Turn in Australia\u201d) to the Times (\u201cThousands trapped on Australian beaches by \u2018apocalyptic\u2019 fires\u201d) and the New York Times (\u201cThousands Flee to Shore as Australia Fires Turn Skies Blood Red\u201d). The Australian fires were the top story on the BBC website, as well as CNN. CNN\u2019s headline read \u201cAustralia\u2019s deadly wildfires are showing no signs of stopping\u201d, while the BBC focused on the mass evacuations: \u201cRace to flee \u2018leave zone\u2019 as bushfire threat looms\u201d. In New Zealand, where glaciers turned brown and skies red due to smoke blown over from Australia, many criticised Morrison, with Greenpeace comparing his leadership to that of Jacinda Ardern, who has been widely praised for leading New Zealand through two mass-casualty events in 2019. Former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark said the bushfires were affecting New Zealand\u2019s pristine alpine region. \u201cImpact of ash on glaciers is likely to accelerate melting\u201d Clark tweeted. \u201cHow one country\u2019s tragedy has spillover effects.\u201d Netflix documentary filmmaker David Farrier, also a Kiwi, tweeted Matthew Abbott\u2019s picture of a kangaroo escaping the flames, along with the words: \u201c2020. you fucking idiots in charge who don\u2019t get this: global warming is real.\u201d",

The former Nissan chairman who fled the country to Lebanon while out on bail, will speak to the media in Beirut next Wednesday, media reports said, in a public appearance that could provide answers to myriad questions swirling around his daring escape. Few countries will be monitoring Ghosn\u2019s comments more closely than Japan, where his work to turn around Nissan earned him something of a saviour image. The official response in Japan has been a mixture of condemnation \u2013 including by his own lawyers \u2013 and disbelief that a high-profile suspect under strictly monitored house arrest could have fled overseas, apparently without a passport. Ghosn was carrying one of his two French passports when he left Japan, according to a Japanese media report. Public broadcaster NHK said the court had allowed him to keep a second French passport as long as it was kept \u201cin a locked case\u201d with the key held by his lawyers. The most widely circulated account of his escape \u2013 that he was carried out of his Tokyo residence in a wooden case for a musical instrument and spirited out of the country on a private jet from Kansai International airport in western Japan \u2013 has been challenged by Carole Ghosn. She described the account as \u201cfiction\u201d on Wednesday, but declined to provide details of her husband\u2019s exit. On Thursday Turkish police detained several people after the interior ministry launched a probe into the transit of Ghosn through the country, according to broadcaster NTV. Japan\u2019s government has yet to publicly comment on Ghosn\u2019s escape, news of which broke as millions of people left Tokyo and other major cities to spend the New Year holidays in their home towns. Ghosn led TV news bulletins earlier this week, but most viewers were glued to their screens for the annual red-and-white singing contest, celebrity variety shows and, on Thursday, the start of the Hakone Ekiden long-distance relay race. \u201cWhen I saw the news I thought, if you have the money you can do anything you like,\u201d said Chiaki Kurimoto, a part-time worker in Osaka . \u201cIt\u2019s just like a spy movie.

Masahisa Sato, an MP from the ruling Liberal Democratic party, described Ghosn\u2019s actions as \u201can illegal departure and an escape, and this itself is a crime. Was there help extended by an unnamed country? It is also a serious problem that Japan\u2019s system allowed an illegal departure so easily.\u201d The filmmaker Kazuhiro Soda acknowledged that Ghosn had broken the law by skipping bail, but said in a tweet: \u201cMany people are reluctant to blame him, probably because the arbitrary and unfair application of the law under the Abe administration has become a norm.\u201d Soda added the episode was proof that the rule of law in Japan \u201cis in crisis\u201d. Masaru Kaneko, an emeritus professor at Keio University, suggested double standards had been at work in Ghosn\u2019s treatment, contrasting his arrest and long detention with the decision not to take action against Noriyuki Yamaguchi, a high-profile TV journalist who is close to Abe\u2019s administration, over allegations that he raped reporter Shiori Ito. Yamaguchi has consistently denied the allegations, although Ito won damages in a civil lawsuit last month. The Lebanese presidency on Thursday denied reports that President Michel Aoun had welcomed Ghosn upon his arrival in the country. Reuters repeated claims made by the Wall Street Journal that the plan to get Ghosn out of Japan had been three months in the making. \u201cIt was a very professional operation from start to finish,\u201d one of the sources said, adding that Ghosn had thanked Aoun for the support he had given him and his wife Carole while he was in detention. It is unclear how much Ghosn, who has remained silent since releasing a statement on New Year\u2019s Eve, will reveal when he speaks to the media on 8 January, a year to the day since he proclaimed his innocence in his first public appearance since his arrest in November 2018. He is likely to be come under pressure to offer a full account of the circumstances behind his arrival in Lebanon on Monday morning, but is reportedly unwilling to share details of his escape to protect people who helped him in Japan. Ghosn, who is of Lebanese origin and holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian passports, insisted in the statement he had not fled justice after being charged with underreporting his income, transferring Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest and other charges for which he faced up to 15 years in prison. \u201cI am now in Lebanon and will no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied, in flagrant disregard of Japan\u2019s legal obligations under international law and treaties it is bound to uphold,\u201d the statement said.",

      "body": "<p>What will British identity mean in 2050? The leap is so immense, and the perils of this particular age \u2013 the climate crisis, chiefly, but also the insistent rise of fascism and the turmoil it tends to bring with it \u2013 so vast, that it feels audacious and borderline dangerous to even conceive of the nation 30 years hence, let alone predict the notions binding the people within it.</p> <p>However, holding that petrifying thought in my head, I was ambling up the stairs of a primary school, looking at the posters a bunch of kids had been forced by some Goveian idiocy to make about \u201cBritish values\u201d. This is part of what our collective identity boils down to \u2013 the beliefs we share to an exceptional degree. . And given that a faith in our continued existence is a prerequisite for thinking seriously about anything, it is reasonable, and not tempting fate, to ask: what will hold these adults of 2050 together? What hand-me-downs, if any, will they still be wearing?</p> <p>One of them had made a collage from bits of newspapers, with the words \u201crule of law\u201d, \u201cdemocracy\u201d, \u201criots\u201d and \u201carrested\u201d cut out and pasted on to a rough-hewn and rather beautiful union flag. Charmingly, he had taken \u201crule of law\u201d to mean that what we were most proud of was that, when we rioted, we (almost) always got arrested.</p> <p>Overall, the rule of law and the institutions of democracy come up a lot in our collective self-fashioning. When the Guardian raised this question in 2004 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/18/2020\" title=\"\">what would 2020 look like?</a> \u2013 the think-tanker Tom Bentley wrote of our \u201cgrand institutions\u201d all being in retreat: he lumped together membership of trades unions and churches with trust in \u201cthe monarchy, the legal system, the church, the civil service or parliament\u201d, and saw it all in terminal decline, on a downward trajectory that had been set since the mid-80s.</p> <p>This was only half-right: leaving the monarchy aside for the moment, certainly trade unions and churches have seen their memberships fall off. Democracy, however, remains core to the British identity: while trust in politicians is low, belief in representative democracy remains high, according to the most recent <a href=\"https://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Social Attitudes Survey</a>. It looks like a paradox, but it isn\u2019t. You can hate your doctor, but still believe in medicine.

It\u2019s interesting that, even in 2004, we were fretting about their addiction to phones \u2013 there wasn\u2019t even much going on with a phone back then. Now they contain the sum of all human knowledge. I wouldn\u2019t draw a significant warning from it; I bet if Wordsworth had had a smartphone, he would have spent 45% of his time looking at it, and still written poetry. Maybe not as much, but arguably, some of his poems could be shorter. However, the infinite accessibility of knowledge and culture inevitably broadens horizons; I can\u2019t remember us being very interested in Korean pop 30 years ago. The sense that this is driving a global homogeneity, so that ultimately everybody will consume the same sort of everything \u2013 food, music, sitcoms, memes, hate figures, unrest \u2013 has to be set against that very homogeneity driving a human need to differentiate. The more connected we are, the more intensely we feel our distinct identities. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a subtle intensification of regional identity, coexisting quite naturally with an increasingly global perspective.</p> <p>What really struck me about the predictions we made in 2004 was how dispiriting many of the conversations were: it was all ageing populations, individualism, consumerism, society reduced to the social life, morality reduced to manners, community reduced to the family, families reduced to the nucleus, institutions drained of relevance, ideologies abandoned by an increasingly atomised populace, who might come together over brand loyalty or gardening. Or they might not.</p> <p>There was very high consensus around things that simply weren\u2019t true: that the large questions of politics had been resolved, and our debates in the future would be largely technical; that solidarity was dated, ambition was personal; that people\u2019s dreams would hereafter be very simple: a home, a hearth, a partner, some stuff. This made the most realistic future the one that largely resembled the present, any notion of seismic change centring mainly on technology \u2013 faster stuff. Turbulent times also throw off our readings, of course: it\u2019s possible that we overestimate the pace of change in the future, when things change so fast from week to week right now. But a national crisis, whether political, social, environmental, economic, or all of them at once, also underlines the necessity of radical change, and cracks open the possibility that it might be radically for the better.</p>",

There was very high consensus around things that simply weren\u2019t true: that the large questions of politics had been resolved, and our debates in the future would be largely technical; that solidarity was dated, ambition was personal; that people\u2019s dreams would hereafter be very simple: a home, a hearth, a partner, some stuff. This made the most realistic future the one that largely resembled the present, any notion of seismic change centring mainly on technology \u2013 faster stuff. Turbulent times also throw off our readings, of course: it\u2019s possible that we overestimate the pace of change in the future, when things change so fast from week to week right now. But a national crisis, whether political, social, environmental, economic, or all of them at once, also underlines the necessity of radical change, and cracks open the possibility that it might be radically for the better.",

We spoke to experts and people who have made major life changes to get the lowdown.</p> <h2>Listen to your gut</h2> <p>Claudia, a 30-year-old teacher from London, was wedding-dress shopping with her mother in April 2018 when she broke down. \u201cMy mum looked at me in the shop and said: \u2018You seem so unhappy.\u2019\u201d Claudia confessed she had been having doubts. \u201cI had been having panic attacks, and at that moment I decided it was best not to go ahead with it,\u201d she remembers. She went home that evening and told her fiance the wedding was off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d0dc6035478b8fbc3098a14d6163a21bc3fa994f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0dc6035478b8fbc3098a14d6163a21bc3fa994f/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wedding dresses on a rack\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I feel so much more free\u2019 ... Claudia has no doubt calling off her wedding was the right decision.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: zhrkznn/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Claudia hadn\u2019t expected was for so many people to tell her she was making a mistake. \u201cEveryone around me thought I was mad,\u201d she says. But Claudia stands by her decision. \u201cI just had that feeling in my gut. It\u2019s been really hard, and there have definitely been points this year where I\u2019ve thought: what have I done? But, overall, it\u2019s better for me to be out of it. I feel so much more free.\u201d</p> <h2>Think things through ...</h2> <p>If you are unhappy with your life and are thinking about making a major change, hammer out exactly what you hope to achieve by ripping things up and starting afresh. \u201cAsk yourself: am I running away from something or walking towards something?\u201d says Dr Carole Pemberton, a career coach and personal-resilience expert. \u201cBe clear about why you\u2019re doing this and why it matters to you. That has to be your anchor. When things are challenging and you\u2019re experiencing doubt, you need your anchor to hold on to, to remind you why you\u2019re doing this.\u201d</p> <h2>... but don\u2019t overthink</h2> <p>\u201cSometimes, communication is good,\u201d says Colin, a 37-year-old marketer from London. He separated from his wife last summer, after 10 years of marriage. \u201cBut sometimes talking doesn\u2019t sort stuff out. You just talk about the same things over and over again.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to a big life change, at some point you will have to move from thinking into action \u2013 and dragging your feet on necessary change can create pointless pain. Colin advises anyone in a loveless marriage to end the relationship, rather than hoping things will improve on their own. \u201cCounselling can\u2019t make you love someone again ... Life is too short, and there\u2019s potentially someone else out there who\u2019s a better fit for you. It\u2019s a waste of everyone\u2019s time and feelings to stay.\u201d</p> <h2>Make the leap</h2> <p>\u201cJust before the decision was the hardest bit,\u201d says 30-year-old Catherine Offord. She quit her PhD to go to work as a teacher in Micronesia in 2016. \u201cAfterwards, it felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. I didn\u2019t regret it once.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65a7c24001b691046cf42abdb9eb534ae306ab0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65a7c24001b691046cf42abdb9eb534ae306ab0d/0_0_2048_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Offord\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I didn\u2019t regret it once\u2019 ... Catherine Offord moved to Micronesia in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Catherine Offord</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One thing that had been holding Offord back was a feeling of failure for not completing her PhD, even though she wasn\u2019t enjoying the course. But, over time, she realised that her happiness was more important than seeing something through for the sake of it. \u201cSometimes, you have to cut your losses.\u201d</p> <p>It helped to break down the decision into manageable steps. \u201cIt felt really overwhelming to make a decision that would potentially affect the rest of my life. It paralysed me. But when I decided that I was only going to make a decision for the next year, that was really helpful.\u201d</p> <h2>Conquer your fears</h2> <p>The first time 38-year-old Victoria Bryan got into a cockpit, she freaked out. Formerly a journalist from the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/mar/08/why-airlines-need-more-female-pilots-to-take-to-the-skies\" title=\"\">she is training in New Zealand to be a pilot</a>. \u201cI was absolutely petrified. I thought: Oh my god, what have I done?\u201d Obviously, moving to the other side of the world to retrain as a pilot is a dramatic change \u2013 and surely anyone would panic the first time they were asked to fly a plane. But more prosaic changes can be similarly terrifying.</p> <p>If you are feeling overwhelmed, reach out to family and friends. \u201cTalking to people is one of the best things you can do,\u201d says Bryan. \u201cDon\u2019t bottle everything up. When you\u2019re overwhelmed, it\u2019s tempting to hide yourself away and have a good cry. But it\u2019s better in the long run to get out there and socialise with people.\u201d</p> <h2>Build up your support system</h2> <p>After Claudia broke off her engagement, many of the friends she had shared with her fiance turned frosty. \u201cFind the people who will stick by you,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mum said: \u2018I don\u2019t agree with what you\u2019re doing, but I respect you and will support you through it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou need to have supporters,\u201d says Pemberton. \u201cPeople who will give you emotional support, but can also give you a shake and a loving boost if you\u2019re having wobbles.\u201d</p> <p>You may lose friends in the process of your change, particularly if it involves a relationship that is coming to an end, but that is par for the course. Try not to let it bother you too much. \u201cIf there\u2019s someone who\u2019s completely unsupportive of your decision, you have to question whether that person has your best interests at heart,\u201d Claudia says.</p> <h2>That strange feeling will pass</h2> <p>When Colin moved out of the family home he had shared with his wife, the sensation of living on his own again after a decade of married life felt deeply odd. \u201cThe moment I opened the front door and found myself in a new house was a shock,\u201d he remembers. The strangeness is still there now, but he is used to it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61d91c59741360f83a9e8bc9d4785d153e0e5179\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61d91c59741360f83a9e8bc9d4785d153e0e5179/0_0_1600_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria Bryan in the air over New Zealand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aiming high ... Victoria Bryan in the air over New Zealand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Victoria Bryan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One way to get over the weirdness is to focus on your new life. \u201cThrow yourself into whatever you\u2019re doing that\u2019s new,\u201d says Bryan. If you have moved somewhere completely new, try to befriend as many people as possible. \u201cYou have to give your new life your all. You can\u2019t just be longing for your old life and not committed to your new environment.\u201d</p> <h2>Accept the doubt</h2> <p>\u201cSelf-doubt is a necessary component of any major life change,\u201d says Gurpreet Singh, a therapist at the counselling charity Relate. \u201cUse your strength to overcome those feelings.\u201d Some life changes may well feel like failures: divorce, having to downsize, or retraining after a business folded, for example. Try to keep things in perspective. \u201cA lot of good can come out of making mistakes,\u201d says Singh. \u201cWe fall 100 times before we learn to walk.\u201d</p> <p>A good way to conquer doubt is to work on your emotional resilience. \u201cA big thing that undermines emotional resilience is overthinking,\u201d says Pemberton. \u201cIf something goes wrong, or you have a vision of how you want your life to be and it hasn\u2019t worked out, try not to go over the things that have unsettled you. Catch your inner voice when it is saying: this is a disaster, I\u2019ve ruined my life and I\u2019ll never have another relationship. A more useful thought to have is: this feeling will pass.\u201d</p> <h2>Swerve nostalgia</h2> <p>It is easy to be nostalgic for your old life. When Colin visits his daughter at his ex-wife\u2019s house, he sometimes misses the easy intimacy of family life: \u201cJust sitting on the sofa, the three of you, watching TV.\u201d In those moments, he reminds himself that he misses the feeling of being in a family, not his marriage. \u201cSometimes, I think: I could just stay here. But then I remember that I don\u2019t miss my ex-wife.\u201d</p> <p>Pemberton says that, after change, we often hark back to a faulty narrative about how things were better before. \u201cRemind yourself of all the reasons it wasn\u2019t a better life,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd remember that you can only lead the life you want if you are willing to take a risk.\u201d</p> <h2>Focus on your future happiness</h2> <p>Big changes are not without pain. When the going gets tough, focus on your long-term happiness. Claudia knew that calling off her wedding was the right thing to do, because she didn\u2019t want to find herself a decade down the line in an unhappy marriage. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to wake up one day and look at someone I care about and realise that we spent years making each other miserable,\u201d she explains. \u201cLife is too short, and it\u2019s important to be happy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been really good for me,\u201d says Bryan of her life change. \u201cIt\u2019s done me the power of good to do something totally different with my life.\u201d Mostly, she has learned that, if you are unhappy with your life, you have to take a leap of faith. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit there and think things will improve. You\u2019re the only one who can make positive changes in your life. You have to go out and do it.\u201d</p> <p>Above all, be optimistic. You are much stronger than you think. \u201cAs humans, we are innately resilient,\u201d says Pemberton. \u201cA big change is bound to stretch our resilience at times. But, most of the time, we can cope with the demands upon us and recover quickly.\u201d Embrace change. You\u2019ve got this.</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "When I was 26, I broke up with a long-term partner, got an ill-advised facial piercing and changed careers \u2013 all in the space of a month. What I learned during those four weeks is that life is like a cake: you can\u2019t unbake it if you don\u2019t like the flavour; sometimes, you need to chuck the entire thing in the bin and start again from scratch. It is harder that way, but who wants to spend the rest of their life eating cupcakes when really they wanted lamingtons? Change is hard. Change is scary. Change is a tedious administrative nightmare. Unfortunately, change is also critical to our continued happiness as humans. Even if we can\u2019t bring ourselves to embrace change, we should try not to avoid it at all costs. But what about life-changing changes? How do you make the leap into unknown waters \u2013 whether it is swapping jobs, moving to the other side of the world or even leaving your marriage?

      "body": "<p>Sadiq Khan has kickstarted his bid for a second term as London mayor by pledging free travel on the city\u2019s transport for anyone accompanying a disabled person.</p> <p>The promise came on the same day as rail passengers nationally were hit with annual fare increases, this year averaging 2.7%.</p> <p>The pass would provide free travel for anyone accompanying a disabled person on all services including the tube, Overground and buses.</p> <p>Although he is consistently polling better than his closest challenger, the Tory candidate Shaun Bailey, over the last 12 months Khan has been criticised for the capital\u2019s rising crime rates and knife crime. His personal popularity ratings nosedived to their lowest ever in the summer of 2019.</p> <p>Travel is a traditional battleground for mayoral candidates, with transport and making the capital more accessible a key part of Khan\u2019s pitch to voters before May\u2019s election.</p> <p>The former Labour MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-elected-mayor-of-london-labour\">became London\u2019s first Muslim mayor</a> in 2016, beating the Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith.</p> <p>Khan said: \u201cMy job is to stand up for all Londoners.

      "bodyText": "Sadiq Khan has kickstarted his bid for a second term as London mayor by pledging free travel on the city\u2019s transport for anyone accompanying a disabled person. The promise came on the same day as rail passengers nationally were hit with annual fare increases, this year averaging 2.7%. The pass would provide free travel for anyone accompanying a disabled person on all services including the tube, Overground and buses. Although he is consistently polling better than his closest challenger, the Tory candidate Shaun Bailey, over the last 12 months Khan has been criticised for the capital\u2019s rising crime rates and knife crime. His personal popularity ratings nosedived to their lowest ever in the summer of 2019. Travel is a traditional battleground for mayoral candidates, with transport and making the capital more accessible a key part of Khan\u2019s pitch to voters before May\u2019s election. The former Labour MP became London\u2019s first Muslim mayor in 2016, beating the Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith. Khan said: \u201cMy job is to stand up for all Londoners. I want to ensure everyone in our city can access our fantastic transport network, and that travel in the capital is inclusive and affordable. \u201cThe companion pass is intended to make a big difference to disabled Londoners. It will help them to move around our city more easily and take advantage of all the fantastic opportunities London has to offer.\u201d He boasted of freezing Transport for London fares for four years in a row under his leadership and rolling out his \u201chopper\u201d bus fare, which provides unlimited travel within a one-hour period. He said if he won the 2020 race he would instruct TfL to work closely with disability and accessibility groups as well as London councils to draw up details of the proposal. It is expected that anyone with a disabled persons\u2019 or older persons\u2019 freedom pass who also requires a companion in order to travel will be able to apply for the new pass. It would be issued to the person who needs assistance so it could be used by different family members, friends or carers. Alan Benson, the chair of Transport for All, which provides advice for disabled transport users, said: \u201cTransport for All have been calling for a companion pass for disabled people on public transport for many years, so we are delighted that this policy will lead Sadiq Khan\u2019s campaign.

In a survey, 43% of UK family doctors said they told parents whose children were struggling with anxiety, depression, self-harm or eating disorders to seek treatment privately if they could afford it because NHS care is heavily rationed and involves delays of up to 18 months. The fact that so many families are being directed to private treatment highlights the inability of NHS child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to cope with the growing demand for care from under-18s who have mental ill health. Many GPs who took part in the research, undertaken by the mental health charity Stem4, criticised CAMHS for not being available to see children and young people they referred for care.

The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet\u2019s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April.

Towns in East Gippsland and the New South Wales south coast are being evacuated by air and sea, after surviving the bushfire by fleeing to the beach. \u201cThe whole country is on fire,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster of epic proportions.\u201d Bonza said Norseman itself was well-stocked with supplies, but urged anyone planning to travel along the Eyre Highway to defer their travel or turn back. \u201cThey think that there are towns along that road, and there aren\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of those names along that road are just roadhouses, there are no towns. \u201cThe main message that we are trying to get out is people just can\u2019t travel on the Eyre Highway, because they are going to get stuck.\u201d The Ngadju Indigenous rangers are the firefighting force in Norseman, and they have been supported by volunteers from bush fire brigades from around WA. All accommodation in Norseman is filled with firefighters, Bonza said. The dryness index in Norseman is at 170 \u2013 meaning the town will need at least 170mm of rain to reach its saturation point. They had 19mm on Christmas night, which was just enough for give firefighters a break on Boxing Day. They had a barbecue and a swim in the pool. Crews have been conducting extensive backburns but Bonza said the fires remained uncontrolled. \u201cEvery time they think they have got it the wind changes and it runs off in another direction.\u201d The fire danger rating for both the Goldfields and Eucla regions on Thursday was catastrophic.",

The program employs Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, providing them with full-time work during the university holidays to gain professional and industry experience, while also supporting the students during their university study. I applied for a cadetship with the CSIRO\u2019s Marine National Facility \u2013 something I never would have been confident enough to do, if not for my past experiences.

The program employs Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, providing them with full-time work during the university holidays to gain professional and industry experience, while also supporting the students during their university study. I applied for a cadetship with the CSIRO\u2019s Marine National Facility \u2013 something I never would have been confident enough to do, if not for my past experiences. A few months later I got a call letting me know I had been successful, and my leap of faith in applying had been worth it. I appreciate how lucky I am to have been able to take part in several opportunities for young Indigenous people, and I also know how disappointed I felt on a few occasions when I wasn\u2019t accepted to similar programs. There is an overwhelming number of young Indigenous students, ready to learn and bond with other like-minded individuals, and not nearly enough opportunities to accommodate the growing demand. Australia must realise the value of these opportunities and the impact they have on young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples \u2013 the people of our future \u2013 and take the initiative to invest more time, money and energy into ensuring these precious educational programs are given the commitment they deserve. I look forward to the day when every single Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander student can be given the opportunities that I experienced. As part of my cadetship with the CSIRO\u2019s Marine National Facility I have been honoured to be able to assist in the planning and delivery of the Indigenous Time at Sea Scholarship (ITSS), a program that will give Indigenous university students opportunities to participate in voyages on board the marine research vessel Investigator. It is an incredible feeling knowing I can provide opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students like the one that changed my life five years ago. As I am writing this, I am on board RV Investigator, undertaking a voyage from Darwin to Fremantle, with two Indigenous university students, Sophie Gilbey and Tiahni Adamson \u2013 the first brilliant students to be awarded the Indigenous Time at Sea Scholarship. These experiences have changed my life and my future for the better, and have made a deep impact on my cultural appreciation and understanding, my love of learning and have shown me the power of knowledge. I have met brothers and sisters from across Australia, been introduced to the diversity of study within science and other educational disciplines, and now I am helping to provide similar opportunities for students just like me. There is no limit to what you can achieve as a young Indigenous person, and everything you experience, whether it be success or not, is valuable. Be brave, and you will be rewarded \u2013 and know that your mob are always walking beside you.

      "bodyText": "Snow and glaciers in New Zealand have turned brown after being exposed to dust from the Australian bushfires, with one expert saying the incident could increase glacier melt this season by as much as 30%. On Wednesday many parts of the South Island woke up to an orange haze and red sun, after smoke from the Victorian and New South Wales blazes drifted east on Tuesday night, smothering many parts of the island for most of the day. On Thursday, pictures taken from the Southern Alps showed the smoke haze carrying particles of dust had tinged snow-capped mountain peaks and glaciers a shade of caramel, with former prime minister Helen Clark expressing concern for the long-lasting environmental impacts on the mountains. \u201cImpact of ash on glaciers is likely to accelerate melting,\u201d Clark tweeted. \u201cHow one country\u2019s tragedy has spillover effects.\u201d There are more than 3,000 glaciers in New Zealand and since the 1970s scientists have recorded them shrinking by nearly a third, with current estimates predicting they will disappear entirely by the end of the century. Professor Andrew Mackintosh is head of the school of earth, atmosphere and environment at Monash University, and the former director of the Antarctic Research Centre. He said in nearly two decades of studying glaciers in New Zealand he had never seen such a quantity of dust transported across the Tasman, and the current event had the potential to increase this season\u2019s glacier melt by 20-30%, although Mackintosh stressed this was no more than an estimate. \u201cIt is quite common for dust to be transported to New Zealand glaciers, but I would say that the amount of transport right now is pretty phenomenal \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything like it,\u201d Mackintosh said.\u201cIt is concerning to me to see so much material being deposited on the glaciers.\u201d Mackintosh said the whiteness of snow and ice reflected the sun\u2019s heat, and slowed melting. But when this whiteness was obscured the glacier could melt at a faster rate. The higher glaciers around Mount Cook could likely get more snowfall soon, Mackintosh said, but the lower glaciers may not get another dump till March, and the dust would sit there until then, likely turning pink when algae began to grow. The impacts of the dust event would likely last no longer than a year, Mackintosh said, but if Australia continued to be impacted by extreme wildfires and droughts \u201cit will be one of the factors that is accelerating the demise of glaciers in New Zealand overall\u201d. The recent smoke haze drifting over New Zealand is the fourth such event this summer, the Met Service said, and despite no official health warnings being issued, many with asthma said they were choosing to remain indoors during the unusual conditions. The Met Service said most of the smoke remaining over New Zealand would clear by Friday. Early in December travel writer Liz Carlson took pictures of regions of the Southern Alps turning pink following exposure to smoke from Australia early in the bushfire season. In a blog Carlson wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty remarkable to see the impact of the fires from so far away.\u201d \u201cOur glaciers don\u2019t need any more battles as they are already truly endangered; it puts the impact of climate change into even more stark reality we can\u2019t ignore.\u201d Residents in Auckland and some parts of the North Island woke to an unusually bright orange sun on Thursday, thought to be a result of the bushfires 2,000km across the Tasman sea.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cLet me be clear to the Australian people, our emissions reductions policies will both protect our environment and seek to reduce the risk and hazard we are seeing today.

Deaths were caused by hypothermia, drowning and landslides, while four died after being electrocuted by power lines, the country\u2019s disaster mitigation agency (BNPB) said on its website on Thursday morning. Nearly 30,000 Jakaratans had been evacuated to temporary shelters throughout the city by Thursday morning, the authorities said. Social affairs ministry spokesman Joko Hariyanto said in a message to Reuters that the death toll had now reached 21 after standing at nine overnight More rain and thunderstorms were forecast for later on Thursday. Television footage showed cars almost completely submerged and people wading through murky brown water in some parts of the capital. Water levels in east and south Jakarta as well as in the satellite cities of Tangerang and Bekasi in West Java province started to rise from 3am local time (2000 GMT) on Wednesday, according to the disaster mitigation agency. Indonesia\u2019s state electricity utility said it had switched off the power in hundreds of districts in Jakarta, which is home to 30 million people. The floods also caused the temporary closure of the runway at Jakarta\u2019s domestic Halim airport, with flights redirected to the capital\u2019s bigger Soekarno airport. City authorities have in the last few years sought to improve the low-lying city\u2019s vulnerability to flooding during the rainy season. More than 50 people died in one of the capital\u2019s deadliest floods in 2007 and five years ago much of the centre of the city was inundated after canals overflowed. Daniel, whose neighborhood was waterlogged, told reporters of his disappointment with the city government\u2019s efforts to mitigate the floods, which happen yearly during the rainy season. \u201cI only have one hope, which is to ask the current governor to fix this because it impact all the people,\u201d he said. \u201cTake the right action please, look at what is happening now, bring the situation back to normal.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "If Woodford folk festival was in mourning this year, you wouldn\u2019t have known it. The death in May of festival elder and decade-long patron Bob Hawke could have loomed large over the week-long festivities in Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast hinterland. Instead, you could say, the festival\u2019s 34th year was a celebration of his life. It wasn\u2019t just the neon caricature of his face decorating the newly renamed Bob\u2019s Bar, or the speeches given by Anthony Albanese and Kevin Rudd during a session to honour Australia\u2019s 23rd prime minister (Blanche d\u2019Alpuget had to cancel her appearance due to illness); Hawke\u2019s legacy lived on in Woodford\u2019s inclusiveness, in its progressive politics, its environmental ethos and its unwavering commitment to hedonism. Certainly Bob would have wanted the party to go on \u2013 and on it did. It was a week in which eastern Australia burned and less fortunate summer festivals were cancelled due to bushfire threat. Woodford\u2019s ticket sales were down by 4.5% as some regulars stayed home to protect their properties. Remarkably, this verdant slice of rural Queensland dodged the brunt of the extreme weather over the new year, enjoying cool nights and blue-sky days and even the occasional gentle shower. For the first time, campers could cool off in the new, on-site Lake Gkula, a 1.5-acre purpose-built conservation area with a natural filtration system and some 400 native fish species. For the uninitiated, Woodford is a real-life choose-your-own-adventure story. This year more than 1,600 shows were spread across 25 stages, complete with a parallel children\u2019s festival and an \u201cartisan alley\u201d for arts and crafts classes. Even before you\u2019d eaten breakfast, you could take an \u201caerobics with joy\u201d class, get rubbed with bush leaves by traditional Arnhem Land healers, join a ukulele workshop, be serenaded by a roving one-man blues band, or gawk at a flock of humans in bird costumes perched in a giant nest 30m up a gumtree. By day you could hear Ian Lowe and Dr Karl Kruszelnicki talk about the renewable energy future or learn sultry new moves in an \u201cexotic solo blues dance\u201d class, take the kids to see Dirtgirl sings songs with Costa Georgiadis about pollination, or simply chug beer to an endless succession of bands. You could carve new shapes in a lino-cutting workshop or watch the sun set on a hilltop overlooking the Glass House Mountains while Tibetan musician Tenzin Choegyal and a group of monks led prayers for world peace. By night, you could dance to the soulful, bass-heavy dub of Kingfisha; watch the R-rated circus variety show Club Briefs; cram in to see the explicit, backwards-facing performance of Betty Grumble (who gave new meaning to the term \u201clip-syncing\u201d); or limbo beneath a broomstick at a \u201cqueer prom night\u201d. If Woodford unofficially anointed a new elder this year, it was Indigenous musician and storyteller Archie Roach.

      "bodyText": "The year 2019 was the hottest on record for Australia with the temperature reaching 1.52C above the long-term average, data from the Bureau of Meteorology confirms. The year that delivered crippling drought, heatwaves, temperature records and devastating bushfires was 0.19C hotter than 2013, the previous record holder. Climate scientists told Guardian Australia that climate change pushed what would have been a hot year into record territory, driving heat extremes and the risk of deadly bushfires. The Bureau of Meteorology data shows the average temperature across the country was 1.52C above the long-term average taken between 1961 and 1990. The second hottest year was 2013, followed by 2005, 2018 and 2017. The data, from the bureau\u2019s long-term ACORN-SAT data, will be used as part of the bureau\u2019s annual climate statement due for release on 9 January. Prof Mark Howden, the director of the ANU Climate Change Institute, said the continued rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, caused mainly by burning fossil fuels, was the underlying driver of the heat. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that greenhouse gas emissions are changing the radiation balance of the Earth. Other contributors are minor in comparison.\u201d He said two other climate systems had also played a role in delivering the record hot year. The Indian Ocean Dipole system had drawn moisture away from the centre of the continent, causing extra heat to build there. Another system known as the Southern Annular Mode had also contributed to the heat. The data also shows that 2019 was the hottest year on record for New South Wales, with temperatures 1.95C above the long-term average, beating the previous record year, 2018, by 0.27C. Western Australia also had its hottest year, with temperatures 1.67C above average, beating the previous 2013 heat record by 0.58C. The Northern Territory and South Australia both had their second hottest years, with 2019 coming in fifth hottest for Victoria and sixth hottest for Queensland, according to the data. Tasmania had a relatively cool year, but was still 0.41C above the long-term average. The previous summer of 2018-19 was the hottest on record. The spring of 2019 also delivered the worst bushfire weather since at least 1950, when the Forest Fire Danger Index data began. On Wednesday 18 December, Australia experienced its hottest day on record with an average maximum temperature of 41.9C (107.4F), beating the previous record by 1C that had been set only 24 hours earlier. Dr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales specialising in extreme events, said 2019 had started hot, with the previous summer being the hottest on record. She said: \u201cThe extremes have been seen in lots of heatwaves and, of course, the bushfires, that are a consequence of the very hot and dry conditions.\u201d She said while natural climate cycles had pushed temperatures higher, \u201cclimate change has given them a boost\u201d. \u201c2019 would not have been pleasant anyway, but climate change has made it worse. We are focusing now on the bushfires, but the underlying heat has been driving these conditions for much of the year. \u201cClimate change isn\u2019t the outright cause, but it\u2019s an undeniable contributor to this extreme year on all accounts.\u201d A bureau spokesperson said it would provide official comment on the 2019 temperatures in its annual climate statement on January 9 that would include a \u201ccomprehensive analysis of the year\u2019s weather events and climate context, including any records of note\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Rodeo season has got off to a rocky start in New Zealand, with protest numbers swelling outside events around the country. Around three dozen protesters chanted outside the Wanaka rodeo in the South Island on Thursday \u2013 \u201cthere\u2019s no excuse for animal abuse\u201d \u2013 calling for an end to the sport, which they say is cruel and demeaning to the animals. Around 100 protesters also turned out at Warkworth rodeo near Auckland calling for a council ban. The animal protection society Safe said four animals died in rodeos in New Zealand last year, and the government needed to follow the lead of the UK in outlawing all events. Earlier this year Safe claimed its first victory after the Northland Mid Northern Rodeo Club cancelled its rodeo due to financial pressures. \u201cEvery year at the Wanaka rodeo, normally docile animals are bullied, abused or killed by so-called \u2018cowboys\u2019,\u201d said Safe spokesman Will Appelbe. \u201cThe reality is that all animals used in rodeo are treated appallingly. Horses, bulls and calves are all bullied and tormented purely so a few people can play \u2018cowboy\u2019 for the day.\u201d Of particular concern to Safe was the use of \u201cflank straps\u201d on bulls and and horses, Appelbe said, with the animals being \u201criled up\u201d before the event and then fitted with the straps which were pulled tight, causing them to buck in an attempt to remove the pressure. Safe and other animal rights groups say rodeos place undue stress on the animals, as well as causing a litany of injuries including torn ligaments, broken bones, bruising and internal damage, particularly in the rope and tie and steer wrestling events, which use calves. \u201cMost people don\u2019t realise they [bulls] are prey animals, so being ridden by a \u2018cowboy\u2019 makes them feel as if a predator has jumped on their back.\u201d Appelbe added. New Zealand\u2019s rodeo is a small circuit, with just 35 events a year and 500 competitors, but draw large crowds in the holiday season. In the last few years major businesses such as Foodstuffs, Meridian Energy and House of Travel have withdrawn their sponsorship from rodeo events over animal welfare concerns, causing many clubs to struggle financially. Lyall Cocks, president of the New Zealand Rodeo Cowboys Association, said vets are on duty at every event, monitoring animals welfare and removing any animals from competition that display signs of stress. Animals are checked before and after they enter the arena, Cocks said. Cocks describes rodeos as a \u201clifeline\u201d for isolated rural communities and said the events test real-life stockman skills with on-farm application. So far the Labour coalition government has refused to cave to protesters demands, but animal rights groups say their protest action will only get bigger, placing more pressure on the government in an election year. For cowboy Chad Ormsby, the protesters are no more than an uncomfortable distraction, and he, like many in the rodeo community, criticise the activists for failing to understand the culture. \u201cI see our animals like children, they need training, education and respect \u2013 then they learn their job and what is expected of them,\u201d said Ormsby. \u201cIt is silly to think about hurting the animals or doing harm by them because in this world, we need them, we need to look after them.\u201d Queenstown Vegan Society spokesperson, Kat Gollop, who was protesting outside the Wanaka rodeo, said children should be taught to respect animals but that would not happen when they were being \u201cexploited in the name of entertainment\u201d. \u201cChildren attending rodeo are being desensitised to the distress, fear, and injury of animals,\u201d Gallop said. \u201cIn their pre-election campaign, the Labour party promised to get rid of some of the cruellest aspects of rodeo events.

The TUC released research showing that fares for commuters have risen by 46% since 2009 \u2013 in a decade when average weekly wages have risen by 23%. The TUC said many UK commuters spent seven times as much on season tickets as passengers in Europe, while private rail companies had paid out more than \u00a31.2bn in dividends to shareholders in the last five years. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cWorking people have had enough of overcrowded and unreliable services. The number one priority should be running a world-class railway service, not subsidising shareholders.\u201d The RMT union said rolling stock companies, which lease trains to operators, had paid \u00a32.4bn to shareholders in the last 10 years. The Rail Delivery Group, which speaks for the industry, said there was continued investment with more than 1,000 new carriages and more than 1,000 additional services coming in across the UK in 2020. However, politicians across Britain are losing patience. The mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, has given Abellio-run West Midlands Trains an ultimatum to sort out its \u201csimply woeful service\u201d by the end of January or he will formally request that the government ends its franchise. Meanwhile, the mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool, Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, have repeatedly urged the government to strip Arriva of the Northern rail franchise and said TransPennine Express should be next, after weeks of delays and cancellations.",

Since the runaway success of its meatless sausage roll, the chain \u2013 which serves more than 6 million customers a week from its 2,000 outlets \u2013 has been working to develop vegan versions of its other bestselling items. The new product arrives on Greggs\u2019 shelves at the start of Veganuary \u2013 a growing movement that encourages people to embrace plant-based diets during January. The vegan steak bake has been created to mirror some of the original snack\u2019s features, including 96 thin layers of puff pastry but without the egg glaze. The filling is made with pieces of the fungi-based protein Quorn instead of beef, mixed with diced onions and meat-free gravy. Costing from \u00a31.55, it will go on sale in 1,300 shops from Thursday before being rolled out to the remaining 700 outlets on 16 January.

Speculation about its successor has been mounting for months but has been rife for the last few days after a sign for a steak bake was spotted in a store and circulated on social media. The launch comes as retailers expand their vegan and plant-based offerings amid the growing popularity of flexitarian diets \u2013 where a largely vegetable-based diet is supplemented occasionally with meat. The Co-op chain is rolling out a new vegan range, called Gro, featuring 35 products, including alternatives to its steak bake, chilli con carne and sticky toffee pudding, that will be stocked in 2,000 stores and up to 4,000 independent retailers through its wholesale operation.

      "bodyText": "The UK economy ended 2019 in stagnation, under pressure from long-term uncertainty, mounting business costs and a global economic slowdown, according to a business survey. The British Chambers of Commerce\u2019s (BCC) latest quarterly economic snapshot, based on a poll of 6,500 firms across the country in November, painted a gloomy picture of the economy at the end of the last decade. The service sector, which accounts for almost 80% of economic output, worsened in the final quarter of the year. Indicators for factories\u2019 export and domestic orders were negative for two consecutive quarters for the first time in a decade, and manufacturers\u2019 investment plans hit an eight-year low. Cash flow, a key indicator of the health of businesses, improved slightly from its lowest level in eight years but remained very weak across the manufacturing and service industries. Suren Thiru, the BCC\u2019s head of economics, said: \u201cThe UK economy limped through the final quarter of 2019. \u201cThe fourth quarter was characterised by a broad-based slowdown in the dominant services sector with all key indicators weakening in the quarter, amid sluggish household expenditure and crippling cost pressures. \u201cDespite some improvements, indicators in the manufacturing sector remain very weak by historic standards. A faltering service sector together with listless manufacturing activity points to a downbeat outturn for UK GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2019.\u201d The BCC is forecasting a slowdown in economic growth to 0.2% in the final three months of 2019, from 0.3% in the third quarter. The Bank of England estimates growth of just 0.1% in the fourth quarter, when high street spending stalled and many firms put investment plans on hold before the election and due to Brexit uncertainty. The BCC estimates the UK economy grew by 1.3% in 2019. It predicts growth will slow to 1% in 2020, which would be the weakest performance since 2009. The BCC said the key indicators in the service sector remained well below their historic averages. The balance of firms reporting increased domestic sales minus those reporting lower sales worsened to 11% between October and December, from 15% in the third quarter. Those reporting increased domestic orders fell from 9% to 6%. Both are at their lowest level since the first quarter of this year. The export sales measure dropped from 6% to 5%, while export orders slipped from 1% to 0%, the lowest level since early 2019. Fewer firms are reporting improved cash flow, and the number of those looking to increase investment or training has also dropped from the third quarter. Turning to manufacturers, the measures for domestic and export sales improved slightly. However, order books were negative for the last two quarters. The export orders balance remained stuck at -3%, the first time since autumn 2009 that this measure has been negative for two quarters in a row. This is despite a decline of about 10% in the value of the pound against the dollar and the euro since the 2016 Brexit vote, which has made UK exports more competitive. The domestic orders balance for manufacturing firms improved from -7% to -1%, but has been negative for two consecutive quarters for the first time since the end of 2011. Adam Marshall, the BCC\u2019s director general, called on the government to use its newfound majority to take big decisions to stimulate growth. \u201cThe end of political deadlock at Westminster must also bring action to renew business confidence and tackle the prolonged stagnation that\u2019s affecting so much of the UK economy.
