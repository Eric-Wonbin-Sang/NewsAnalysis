      "body": "<p>Wildlife and environmental TV programmes have \u201cfailed wholeheartedly\u201d in the past to spark action on the climate, biodiversity loss and the growing human population, Chris Packham has told an audience of TV executives.</p> <p>The Springwatch presenter said that although recent series had \u201cturned a corner\u201d, programme-makers must \u201cshout more loudly\u201d to tell the truth about environmental crises and call out politicians\u2019 lies.</p> <p>He said future generations may come to regard today\u2019s leaders such as Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Jair Bolsonaro and Scott Morrison in a similar way as current generations see Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot, because they could by then have caused the deaths of millions of people.</p> <p>\u201cIf we let them, they have the capacity to become genocidal maniacs because of their inactions, because of their actions when it comes to caring for our planet,\u201d he said in the annual Bafta television lecture at the Barbican in London on Tuesday evening.</p> <p>Packham, whose Horizon documentary <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000dl6q\">7.7 Billion People and Counting</a> was broadcast on BBC Two on Tuesday night, read the audience a short story he had written, set in a future where starving people queue to look at the last tree on the planet. He said science fiction might become science fact given the rising population, the \u201cterrifying\u201d collapse in biodiversity and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s warning that runaway global heating must be tackled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">within </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">10 years</a>.</p> <p>In a video segment filmed in Tanzania, Packham said he was often told while making wildlife documentaries that it was not his job to make statements of environmental fact, \u201cbecause that\u2019s news, that\u2019s something that\u2019s got to be reported by journalists\u201d. He said the recent UK general election had been marked by many journalists\u2019 failure to challenge lies.</p> <p>\u201cIf someone tells you it\u2019s sunny and someone else tells you it\u2019s raining, you don\u2019t quote them both, you look out of the bloody window and see whether it\u2019s sunny or raining and then you tell the truth about it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAt this point in time, when it comes to environmental journalism, it is dangerous to lie because we have to tell the truth. Truth is the most essential component of progress.\u201d</p> <p>Packham added: \u201cFor most of the last 30 or 40 years we\u2019ve been making bits of the world look like paradise, absolute utopias. We go to places, there are never any people there, everything is functional, everything is beautiful. OK, we\u2019ve excited people, we\u2019ve fascinated people, we\u2019ve shown them things they could never, ever have dreamed of, and they have fallen in love with that environment through awe and wonder and affinity \u2013 but has their love actually transformed into making a real difference? No.\u201d</p> <p>Packham praised Blue Planet II for bringing plastic pollution to global attention and the One Show\u2019s campaign to raise awareness on the same issue. The BBC\u2019s Seven Worlds, One Planet contained some \u201chard-hitting stuff\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are starting to make these programmes and the BBC has a real commitment to make more,\u201d he told the Guardian before the speech, describing his Horizon documentary as \u201clike a smack in the face with a sledgehammer\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hardcore. It\u2019s the hardest programme the BBC have done yet.\u201d</p> <p>Packham said Bafta\u2019s <a href=\"https://wearealbert.org/about/\">We are Albert</a> campaign, which encourages the film and TV industries to reduce their environmental impact, was a step in the right direction but he urged programme-makers to set meaningful targets to become carbon neutral within three years.</p> <p>He described recent environmental TV productions that used single-use plastic, where crew members flew home for weekends and where two camera operators flew to a location in a private jet. Such practices were \u201can open door for enormous and justified criticism\u201d, he said.</p> <p>He told the audience: \u201cYou\u2019re going to say it\u2019s going to come with a cost, budgets are getting smaller. They are not getting as small as the wildlife populations out here in the world \u2026 you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wildlife and environmental TV programmes have \u201cfailed wholeheartedly\u201d in the past to spark action on the climate, biodiversity loss and the growing human population, Chris Packham has told an audience of TV executives. The Springwatch presenter said that although recent series had \u201cturned a corner\u201d, programme-makers must \u201cshout more loudly\u201d to tell the truth about environmental crises and call out politicians\u2019 lies. He said future generations may come to regard today\u2019s leaders such as Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Jair Bolsonaro and Scott Morrison in a similar way as current generations see Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot, because they could by then have caused the deaths of millions of people. \u201cIf we let them, they have the capacity to become genocidal maniacs because of their inactions, because of their actions when it comes to caring for our planet,\u201d he said in the annual Bafta television lecture at the Barbican in London on Tuesday evening. Packham, whose Horizon documentary 7.7 Billion People and Counting was broadcast on BBC Two on Tuesday night, read the audience a short story he had written, set in a future where starving people queue to look at the last tree on the planet. He said science fiction might become science fact given the rising population, the \u201cterrifying\u201d collapse in biodiversity and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s warning that runaway global heating must be tackled within 10 years. In a video segment filmed in Tanzania, Packham said he was often told while making wildlife documentaries that it was not his job to make statements of environmental fact, \u201cbecause that\u2019s news, that\u2019s something that\u2019s got to be reported by journalists\u201d. He said the recent UK general election had been marked by many journalists\u2019 failure to challenge lies. \u201cIf someone tells you it\u2019s sunny and someone else tells you it\u2019s raining, you don\u2019t quote them both, you look out of the bloody window and see whether it\u2019s sunny or raining and then you tell the truth about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point in time, when it comes to environmental journalism, it is dangerous to lie because we have to tell the truth. Truth is the most essential component of progress.\u201d Packham added: \u201cFor most of the last 30 or 40 years we\u2019ve been making bits of the world look like paradise, absolute utopias. We go to places, there are never any people there, everything is functional, everything is beautiful. OK, we\u2019ve excited people, we\u2019ve fascinated people, we\u2019ve shown them things they could never, ever have dreamed of, and they have fallen in love with that environment through awe and wonder and affinity \u2013 but has their love actually transformed into making a real difference? No.\u201d Packham praised Blue Planet II for bringing plastic pollution to global attention and the One Show\u2019s campaign to raise awareness on the same issue. The BBC\u2019s Seven Worlds, One Planet contained some \u201chard-hitting stuff\u201d, he said. \u201cWe are starting to make these programmes and the BBC has a real commitment to make more,\u201d he told the Guardian before the speech, describing his Horizon documentary as \u201clike a smack in the face with a sledgehammer\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hardcore. It\u2019s the hardest programme the BBC have done yet.\u201d Packham said Bafta\u2019s We are Albert campaign, which encourages the film and TV industries to reduce their environmental impact, was a step in the right direction but he urged programme-makers to set meaningful targets to become carbon neutral within three years. He described recent environmental TV productions that used single-use plastic, where crew members flew home for weekends and where two camera operators flew to a location in a private jet. Such practices were \u201can open door for enormous and justified criticism\u201d, he said. He told the audience: \u201cYou\u2019re going to say it\u2019s going to come with a cost, budgets are getting smaller. They are not getting as small as the wildlife populations out here in the world \u2026 you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d",

Also:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Disappointed. Cos the situation of the game. Deserved to go 1-0 up, not just the sending off but the general play anyway, the way we were playing. Of course we created enough in the second half, it\u2019s the same story for us that we don\u2019t finish our chances, and we make errors to give them two goals on the break. It probably shows us where we\u2019re at. We work hard but basic errors when you should control a game can end up losing you points.</p> <p>We stayed in the mode of dealing with them with 11, when really with 10 we could have been a bit more aggressive. I didn\u2019t mind that, cos at half-time it gave us a chance to reboot, recharge and go it again. Even though we\u2019re disappointed with the result and the goals [we conceded] you still look at the chances we created in the second half and actually also in the first, and say we should be scoring more goals. You let teams stay in the game it becomes really tough, and both the goals I didn\u2019t like. If we\u2019re going to get to where we want to be, and we\u2019re in the process, we\u2019ve got to stop that stuff, cos we can\u2019t get there like that.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the slip from Ngolo, that can happen, it\u2019s the fact they get away at the edge of our box. That\u2019s a moment sleeping. People should know their jobs. And then the last goal, so easy. It\u2019s a goal you see every day over the park, a right back who moves it slowly onto his left foot and rolls it into the far corner.

I\u2019m so proud of the team, how they reacted and how they stepped up when a teammate made a mistake, someone got sent off. It\u2019s a good point in the end, considering the circumstances of the game.</p> <p>I said to the team, I want to see how you behave in this stadium. Come here, away to a big team, we\u2019re hoping to stay in the Champions League race until the end, and you have to come here and you have to win. The way they did it was brilliant.

They lacked creativity again and paid for their carelessness when the electrifying Gabriel Martinelli dented their push for Champions League qualification with a stunning equaliser.</p> <p>While Lampard seethed, Mikel Arteta celebrated Martinelli\u2019s fearlessness and considered the defensive frailties that left Arsenal with a mountain to climb. For all the talk of progress, Arteta will know he must be ruthless with players like Shkodran Mustafi, whose catastrophic error led to David Luiz\u2019s red card against his old side. Yet there was resolve from Arsenal when it mattered. They fell behind again when C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta restored Chelsea\u2019s lead. It did not last. Chelsea are too soft and Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s form in goal is of grave concern.

He could have tried to get goalside of Abraham, not jumped in from behind, gone back to the goal line or just let him score. Surely any of those options were better than tackling Abraham from behind? His error was far worse than Mustafi\u2019s.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s like Steve Cook\u2019s handball for Bournemouth at the weekend: there is an instinctive streak of idiocy that some players can\u2019t control. In this instance, if David Luiz doesn\u2019t bring down Abraham Chelsea take the lead; if he does bring down Abraham Chelsea have a fantastic chance to take the lead <em>and </em>get to play the remainder of the match against 10 men.

      "bodyText": "Right then, I\u2019m off. Here\u2019s the match report again. Bye! Frank Lampard is quite disappointed. He says Tammy Abraham is still being assessed. Also: Disappointed. Cos the situation of the game. Deserved to go 1-0 up, not just the sending off but the general play anyway, the way we were playing. Of course we created enough in the second half, it\u2019s the same story for us that we don\u2019t finish our chances, and we make errors to give them two goals on the break. It probably shows us where we\u2019re at. We work hard but basic errors when you should control a game can end up losing you points. We stayed in the mode of dealing with them with 11, when really with 10 we could have been a bit more aggressive. I didn\u2019t mind that, cos at half-time it gave us a chance to reboot, recharge and go it again. Even though we\u2019re disappointed with the result and the goals [we conceded] you still look at the chances we created in the second half and actually also in the first, and say we should be scoring more goals. You let teams stay in the game it becomes really tough, and both the goals I didn\u2019t like. If we\u2019re going to get to where we want to be, and we\u2019re in the process, we\u2019ve got to stop that stuff, cos we can\u2019t get there like that. It\u2019s not the slip from Ngolo, that can happen, it\u2019s the fact they get away at the edge of our box. That\u2019s a moment sleeping. People should know their jobs. And then the last goal, so easy. It\u2019s a goal you see every day over the park, a right back who moves it slowly onto his left foot and rolls it into the far corner. That can\u2019t happen. Mikel Arteta is quite pleased: I don\u2019t know [if we\u2019ve turned a corner], time will tell, but at least I saw a reaction. What I demand always is never give up. It doesn\u2019t matter the circumstances. We do what we have to do and play with the spirit we played today. I\u2019m so proud of the team, how they reacted and how they stepped up when a teammate made a mistake, someone got sent off. It\u2019s a good point in the end, considering the circumstances of the game. I said to the team, I want to see how you behave in this stadium. Come here, away to a big team, we\u2019re hoping to stay in the Champions League race until the end, and you have to come here and you have to win. The way they did it was brilliant. [Well, they didn\u2019t quite do it, but OK] On Hector Bellerin\u2019s goalscoring comeback: I asked Hector if he was ready go play today, and his first answer was, \u2018Boss, I\u2019m ready.\u2019 So let\u2019s go. These things happen. If you want to play, you enjoy your profession, these good moments come. Arsenal\u2019s discovery of a backbone has caused some surprise: Only four times since 2006, across Europe\u2019s top five leagues, has a team scored with their only two shots of a game. That\u2019s four of about 26,500 matches. Here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg\u2019s match report from Stamford Bridge: Two inconsistent sides, two baffled managers. For Frank Lampard, this result was tough to take. Chelsea played against 10 men for more than an hour, took the lead twice and ended up dropping more points at home. They lacked creativity again and paid for their carelessness when the electrifying Gabriel Martinelli dented their push for Champions League qualification with a stunning equaliser. While Lampard seethed, Mikel Arteta celebrated Martinelli\u2019s fearlessness and considered the defensive frailties that left Arsenal with a mountain to climb. For all the talk of progress, Arteta will know he must be ruthless with players like Shkodran Mustafi, whose catastrophic error led to David Luiz\u2019s red card against his old side. Yet there was resolve from Arsenal when it mattered. They fell behind again when C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta restored Chelsea\u2019s lead. It did not last. Chelsea are too soft and Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s form in goal is of grave concern. The Spaniard was the villain when he somehow let H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn\u2019s shot squirm past him. Much more here: Arsenal were very good in the second half, and that will be a massively morale-boosting result for them, for all that it relied on a two moments when Chelsea players either slipped or snoozed. Chelsea had 19 shots to Arsenal\u2019s two. That\u2019s got to be sore. Tammy Abraham is being helped off the pitch by two members of Chelsea\u2019s medical staff. 90+5 mins: It\u2019s all over! The corner is cleared, and the referee blows his whistle to end a wild London derby. 90+4 mins: TV is watching David Luiz watching on TV, as the game enters its final moments. Chelsea have another corner, their 16th. 90+3 mins: Chelsea eventually get it back, and now they\u2019ve got themselves a corner. They play it short to Hudson-Odoi, which they\u2019ve done a lot from the left side, and he crosses straight out of play, not for the first time. 90+2 mins: Arsenal have the ball, and are happy to keep it by the left corner flag. 90+1 mins: We\u2019re into stoppage time, and there\u2019ll be about four minutes of it. 90 mins: One final substitution, as Willock comes on for Martinelli. 89 mins: What a chance for Chelsea! Hudson-Odoi sends in a low cross from the right, but Batshuayi turns it wide from the near post! Xhaka, throwing out a leg, might have got the slightest touch on it to put the striker off. 88 mins: Frank Lampard is going to give someone an absolute rollicking when he goes back over this goal in training tomorrow. Bellerin is given the ball, wide on the right-hand corner of the penalty area. Emerson and Abraham are in front of him, but neither of them makes even a vague attempt to stay with him when he jinks inside, and his left-footed shot curls into the far corner! Arsenal take their second shot of the game! 85 mins: Abraham was offside, but the officials decided he wasn\u2019t interfering with play (although he absolutely got in the way of Mustafi when the defender could otherwise pretty easily have cleared the cross). Abraham wins a corner, and then looks to injure an ankle on an advertising hoarding. As he limps back into the penalty area the corner is played short, Hudson-Odoi sends the ball in low and it\u2019s tapped in by Azpilicueta! 83 mins: Arsenal\u2019s attacking intent in this half has been commendable. Still, though, they\u2019ve only had one shot. 81 mins: After Chelsea bring on another striker, Arsenal counter by adding a centre-half, as Holding replaces Pepe. 80 mins: Save! The ball is chipped into the penalty area, where Barkley runs beyond the defence and flicks a backwards header towards the near post, but Leno dives to his right to palm it away! 79 mins: Bellerin slides in to take the ball from Willian, at the expense of a corner. That\u2019s the Brazilian\u2019s final action, Batshuayi replacing him. 77 mins: Emerson sends the free kick into the area, and Abraham heads it towards goal from 15 yards, but Leno makes an easy save. 76 mins: Guendouzi gets a yellow card for tugging Mount\u2019s shirt and then kicking him in the knee from behind. There were at least two bookable offences there. 76 mins: Chelsea haven\u2019t really created a clear chance from open play since the 15th minute. 74 mins: Torreira with a fifth-minute-of-stoppage-time clearance, from Willian\u2019s cross. Chelsea get it straight back. 72 mins: Lacazette is played in by Pepe, turns and slams the ball past Kepa, but Chelsea are saved by the fact that he was three yards offside. 70 mins: Chelsea bring Mason Mount on for Kante. 68 mins: Kante tries to bulldoze his way through Arsenal\u2019s penalty area, both Torreira and Xhaka going down as he does so and staying down, apparently for the pure love of timewasting. 66 mins: That was Arsenal\u2019s first shot of any description. Chelsea have had 11. The home side bring Ross Barkley on for Kovacic. 65 mins: Mustafi gets the assist, with that clearing header. And Arsenal run up the other end and score! Martinelli picks it up outside his penalty area and heads for the halfway line. Kante is the last man back and is about to cut out the ball when he slips, allowing Martinelli to just keep on running, all the way into the penalty area, and slide past Kepa! 63 mins: Chelsea win a corner, which Chelsea head away. 60 mins: BT Sport show the number of passes each team has made in the final third. Chelsea lead 107-27. 59 mins: Christensen is booked, for mistiming a challenge on Lacazette as Arsenal look to break. 58 mins: Kante is basically playing as a striker at the moment, alongside Abraham. 55 mins: Arsenal make their first change, bringing Guendouzi on for Ozil. 53 mins: At present, this game is a high-tempo mess. \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing Arteta can do now: station himself behind the Arsenal goal and direct his stare at any Chelsea players who come anywhere near Mustafi,\u201d writes Charles Antaki. \u201cThat, or simply replace Mustafi with a competent footballer.\u201d 51 mins: A minute of chaos in the Arsenal penalty area, featuring a couple of handball appeals and a succession of Chelsea players being about to shoot but not in fact shooting. 49 mins: Kepa passes to Jorginho, who is being very rapidly closed down by Torreira but just about gets the ball away. 46 mins: Emerson\u2019s cross from the left bounces across the area without anyone getting anything on it, and when it comes back in Kante tries to jink his way into a shooting position, then gives up and just shoots anyway, straight into Mustafi. 46 mins: Peeeeeeep! The players are back out, and Tammy Abraham is about to kick off. \u201cI dunno,\u201d writes David Flynn, \u201cwe\u2019ve all seen Luiz this season, that was about as close to winning the ball as he\u2019s gotten in a long time.\u201d Key match stat dept: Chelsea have had nine shots, three on target. Arsenal have had no shots. None. Not one. \u201cDavid Luiz\u2019s calculation was \u2018definitely conceding a goal\u2019 v \u2018probably conceding a goal\u2019,\u201d says Graeme Thorn. \u201cObviously he thought that Bernd Leno had a better chance of saving the penalty than he ultimately did. It\u2019s exactly the same calculation that Luis Suarez did so infamously against Ghana - concede a goal or have a chance of not conceding a goal. As it happens, the penalty was missed, so it paid off for Uruguay.\u201d Similar offences, but while Suarez\u2019s handball was in its way inspired - as his team would have had no time to recover from falling behind at that stage of the game, so it was worth doing anything to keep the ball out of the net - David Luiz\u2019s foul was just stupid, as Arsenal would be more likely to get something out of the game at 0-1 but 11 v 11 with more than an hour to play than they would at 0-0 but 10 v 11, and certainly a lot more likely than at 0-1 and 10 v 11. \u201cDid the referee judge that there was absolutely no way Luiz was trying to get to the ball during that challenge?\u201d asks David Flynn. \u201cThe rules clearly say that if a peno is given and there was an attempt to get the ball then it should be a yellow.\u201d There was no attempt to play the ball, or at least not before David Luiz wrestled Abraham to the floor. VAR checked it, and agreed. 45+3 mins: That\u2019s all for now. Chelsea lead by a man and a goal, and Hudson-Odoi has been excellent. 45+2 mins: Pepe kicks the ball into Emerson\u2019s arm, from all of two feet away, and then gets really angry when there\u2019s no free-kick. 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time we roll, and there\u2019ll be about two minutes of it. 45 mins: Kovacic heads wide from Hudson-Odoi\u2019s cross. Chelsea really haven\u2019t impressed since the penalty. 43 mins: An excellent attempted tackle from Xhaka on Hudson-Odoi, which involves literally lying down in front of him. It doesn\u2019t work. 41 mins: Nothing much comes from the corner, but Arsenal continue to hog possession. 38 mins: A good spell for Arsenal, who cap it with a corner. \u201cInterested in your thoughts on this,\u201d writes Lee Madden. \u201cAlthough there was a mistake by Mustafi, surely the more critical error is from David Luiz. He could have tried to get goalside of Abraham, not jumped in from behind, gone back to the goal line or just let him score. Surely any of those options were better than tackling Abraham from behind? His error was far worse than Mustafi\u2019s.\u201d It\u2019s like Steve Cook\u2019s handball for Bournemouth at the weekend: there is an instinctive streak of idiocy that some players can\u2019t control. In this instance, if David Luiz doesn\u2019t bring down Abraham Chelsea take the lead; if he does bring down Abraham Chelsea have a fantastic chance to take the lead and get to play the remainder of the match against 10 men. Obviously letting Abraham score is better for his team, but his idiot instinct took over. 32 mins: Save! Hudson-Odoi hits a vicious shot with the outside of his right boot, which Leno beats away. 31 mins: The home fans are in full voice now: \u201cHe\u2019s one of our own, he\u2019s one of our own, David Luiz, he\u2019s one of our own!\u201d they cry. 30 mins: Tactical update: Xhaka has dropped into the defence, and Ozil has shifted back into the heart of midfield. Leno does well to stand up and force Jorginho, whose penalty-taking technique seems to rely on convincing goalkeepers to fall over using his Jedi mind-powers, to find a corner, which is precisely what he does! 27 mins: This is horrific self-destruction. Mustafi hopelessly fluffs a pass back to Leno, Abraham nips in, rounds the keeper and is brought down from behind by David Luiz, leaving the referee with no option but to point to the spot and wave red! 26 mins: They\u2019re not booing now! 25 mins: Arsenal engage in another prolonged spell of largely aimless passing. Worth doing just to stem the Chelsea tide, methinks. David Luiz is being booed by a good portion of the crowd, and all this defensive passing is giving everyone many chances to vent their fury. 23 mins: Another left-wing Chelsea corner is played short and then worked back to the original taker, and again the cross when it comes is overhit and floats straight out of play, this time missing the bar by quite a distance. 21 mins: Another thing Chelsea win is the first yellow card, which is shown to Emerson for a foul in several stages on Pepe. 19 mins: Chelsea have been the better team by a distance, and seem to have the run of the right flank, where Martinelli and Saka aren\u2019t quite cutting the mustard. 16 mins: Chelsea hit the bar! Hudson-Odoi, having moved to the left to take a corner, gets the ball back. His right-footed cross worries Leno, but clips the top of the bar on its way out of play. 15 mins: What a chance for Chelsea! Hudson-Odoi is again involved, beating Martinelli on the right and sending in a deep cross which Rudiger heads back into the mixer, leaving Abraham with a free header from six yards! He heads too close to Leno, who catches. 13 mins: Arsenal settle down, taking the pace out of the game by engaging in some harmless defensive interplay. 10 mins: Nearly! It\u2019s an excellent delivery, which Rudiger looks like he\u2019s going to head in and then doesn\u2019t touch, which perhaps explains why Christensen is so astonished to see it reach him that it bounces off his face and out for a goal-kick. 9 mins: Hudson-Odoi is the source of all things good for Chelsea in these early exchanges. Now he links with Abraham, leading to another corner. 8 mins: The Arsenal physio is gamely pretending to be doing something to Mustafi while the defender lets the pain subside. 7 mins: An excellent move from Chelsea ends with Kovacic\u2019s shot thundering into a particularly sensitive part of Mustafi\u2019s anatomy. \u201cI\u2019m missing Unai Emery,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cYou knew where you were with him; confused play; misplaced running about; absent defenders; general vapidity and underachievement. With Arteta one just can\u2019t be sure, and the team might even play very well (though tonight something tells me we might be revisiting old certainties).\u201d 5 mins: Nothing comes of Chelsea\u2019s corner and Arsenal run up the other end and win one of their own, and then another, neither of which come to anything. 3 mins: Another Saka error, this time in defence. He misjudges a long ball to Hudson-Odoi, who is thus able to bring it down (with a fabulous first touch) and smack in a corner that deflects off David Luiz for a corner. 2 mins: Arsenal attack down the left, a move that ends with Saka either crossing terribly or shooting abysmally, it\u2019s hard to tell. 1 min: Peeeeeep! We\u2019re off! Elsewhere, Watford and Southampton are a goal up at Aston Villa and Crystal Palace respectively, while Everton lead Newcastle 1-0 and Bournemouth are winning a match, 2-0 at home to Brighton. The last two teams they led at any stage were Arsenal and Chelsea. The players have left the tunnel! The players are in the tunnel! \u201cThe photo of Hudson-Odoi\u2019s shirt is clearly not from tonight\u2019s game as next to it sits Tomori\u2019s shirt who isn\u2019t in the squad. This is fake news and I demand an enquiry,\u201d rages Geoff Seeley. Curious. Either he was in the initial matchday squad, or he likes to go John Terry and wear full matchday kit under his civvies. For completists, this is the away dressing-room at Stamford Bridge, which if not exactly no-frills is certainly reduced-frills. Interesting fact: Arsenal have a 100% record when wearing their home kit in away games this season (they\u2019ve only done it once): On the plus side, Chelsea have employed an absolutely elite towel-roller. That is some faultless towel-rolling right there. I get the idea of painting encouraging words and phrases on the dressing-room wall, but I do think that \u201csacrifice together\u201d sounds a little more satanist than is ideal. Mikel Arteta on Arsenal\u2019s form: I think performance-wise we\u2019ve been better than results-wise, because late goals in the last two games cost us four points and it could have been a different situation. Today\u2019s game is a different situation. We come in with a clear idea to try to win the game, and we will do that. And on Hector Bellerin\u2019s return - he has only started three league games this season, the last on 5 December: He\u2019s been training for the last few days and he\u2019s looking sharp and good, and I wanted to give opportunities for everybody. So let\u2019s see how he does. Frank Lampard on losing to Newcastle: The lads were down afterwards. I couldn\u2019t complain about the effort, we had a long go at it, and it was a bit of sign of some of our season, particularly in home games, where we create a lot, we get in good areas and we don\u2019t have that finishing touch, and then you get sucker-punched. But it\u2019s important we see today as the game it is. It\u2019s different - it\u2019s Arsenal, a London derby, a big game for us, so that one now is in the back of our minds and we look forwards. And on a lack of goals: It\u2019s something to work on. In terms of our home form we\u2019re creating a lot and not converting a lot. So that\u2019s something we\u2019re working on a lot, so the players can get up the pitch and get into good areas, and then we need more killer instinct, or more composure or whatever it is. I hope to see it tonight, against a team that maybe will come out against us. And on bringing Kovacic in for Mount: Mason\u2019s played a lot, Kovacic has played a lot of big games for us this season. I think midfield it games like this is crucial. Can we control that area and get a grip of it, and then get our wingers into the game? We\u2019ll see. This is a killer stat, as far as Arsenal\u2019s hopes are concerned: Two changes for Chelsea, for whom Reece James and Mason Mount drop out, the latter taking a place on the bench, while Emerson Palmieri and Mateo Kovacic come in. Arsenal make one change, Hector Bellerin coming into the side, and Ainsley Maitland-Niles dropping out. The names of the people playing in this game of association football are as follows: Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Rudiger, Emerson Palmieri, Kante, Jorginho, Kovacic, Hudson-Odoi, Abraham, Willian. Subs: Alonso, Barkley, Pedro, Caballero, Zouma, Mount, Batshuayi. Arsenal: Leno, Bellerin, Mustafi, Luiz, Saka, Torreira, Xhaka, Pepe, Ozil, Martinelli, Lacazette. Subs: Ceballos, Maitland-Niles, Holding, Martinez, Willock, Guendouzi, Nketiah. Referee: Stuart Attwell. There are five other games happening this evening, all of which fall under Nick Ames\u2019 purview here: Only Liverpool have won more away points than Chelsea, but at home they\u2019re really not up to much, having won 17 points - the same as Brighton, Sheffield United, Wolves and, indeed, Arsenal, and only three more than relegation-threatened Watford and Aston Villa. The question is whether Arsenal, who won their first away game of the Premier League season back in August and have repeated the feat just once since, are the team to expose this, particularly with goal-conjuring predator Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang suspended. In other news, Arsenal are the division\u2019s top drawers, 47.8% of their matches so far having ended in stalemate, but there has only been one goalless Gunners game in all competitions (compared with six 2-2s). Chelsea meanwhile really don\u2019t do draws at all: only one in the league since August, and even the draws they have had (in all competitions this season: 2-2, 1-1, 2-2, 4-4, 2-2 and 1-1) have been quite fun. Plus, expectation! \u201cIt\u2019s very, very important for us to win this game,\u201d says Mikel Arteta. \u201cWe need to win.\u201d On which subject, here\u2019s some pre-match reading from the Arsenal camp: And here\u2019s some pre-match reading from the Chelsea camp: Overall and to conclude, I\u2019m expecting an entertaining night with at the very minimum two goals. Over to you, footballers! Kick-off: 8.15pm GMT.",

While Frank Lampard seethed at Chelsea\u2019s lack of conviction at both ends of the pitch, Mikel Arteta wondered what on earth he is going to do with Shkodran Mustafi and marvelled at the fearlessness of Gabriel Martinelli. It was that sort of night, absorbing and bonkers in equal measure, and in the end it was difficult to know whether to focus on Chelsea\u2019s sense of bewilderment or Arsenal\u2019s joy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/22/mikel-arteta-spirit-fight-leadership-arsenal\">Mikel Arteta hails \u2018spirit, fight and leadership\u2019 of 10-man Arsenal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For Lampard, the twist was tough to take but easy to explain. Chelsea played for more than an hour against 10 men, led twice and still dropped more points at home. They lacked creativity again, bolstering the argument that they need attacking reinforcements before the transfer window closes, and paid for their carelessness when Martinelli, an 18-year-old winger with a wonderfully direct style, hauled Arsenal level with a stunning solo goal just after the hour.</p> \n<p>Chelsea\u2019s imprecision is hurting their push for Champions League qualification \u2013 fifth-placed Manchester United will go three points behind them if they beat Burnley at home on Wednesday \u2013 and it spoke volumes that they were incapable of holding on after C\u00e9sar Azipilicueta restored their lead with six minutes left. Lampard\u2019s side are too loose and Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s indifferent form was captured by the moment when H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, cutting on to his left foot, rescued a point for Arsenal with a shot that somehow squirmed beyond Chelsea\u2019s goalkeeper.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"v\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Arrizabalaga has conceded too many soft goals this season but Arteta was entitled to argue Arsenal merited a draw after a show of defiance in the second half.

Granit Xhaka excelled as a makeshift centre-half, Martinelli ran Azpilicueta ragged on the left and Arteta, who has lost only one of his seven games, was delighted with his new side\u2019s spirit on a ground where they have suffered in the past.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/22/david-luiz-arsenal-chelsea-red-card-philsophical-matters\">David Luiz\u2019s red card leaves Arsenal pondering philosophical matters | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Initially David Luiz was the story against his old side. There was no respectful celebration from the Brazilian when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/11/chelsea-psg-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">scored here for Paris Saint-Germain</a> in a Champions League tie in 2015 and he looked to make his presence felt from the start, attracting the ire of the Chelsea fans when he charged into the back of Tammy Abraham and kneed the striker up the backside. Battle lines had been drawn.</p> \n<p>Abraham would have the last laugh, though David Luiz\u2019s dismissal owed much to the brainlessness of Mustafi. While there have been signs of progress under Arteta, the fact remains the Spaniard has inherited a squad containing a multitude of weaknesses. There is only so much Arteta can improve with his work on the training ground and that was underlined by Mustafi\u2019s blunder.</p> \n<p>After a promising opening Chelsea simply had to wait for Arsenal\u2019s most unreliable player to self-destruct. Abraham had fooled Mustafi with a clever turn before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/29/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">scoring his side\u2019s late winner</a> at the Emirates last month and this time he was in the right place when the centre-half sold Bernd Leno horribly short with a staggeringly incompetent back-pass. Abraham raced away, rounded Leno and went down following a desperate lunge from David Luiz.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aacecd898569c4ea9c1766276473a5a5c2e14e2e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aacecd898569c4ea9c1766276473a5a5c2e14e2e/0_192_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Luiz was shown a red card for his challenge on Tammy Abraham.

David Luiz had denied Abraham a clear goalscoring opportunity and he departed with mocking chants ringing in his ears.

      "bodyText": "There were two rookie coaches hopping around on the touchline and both will feel they have spent a lifetime in management after this emotional rollercoaster. While Frank Lampard seethed at Chelsea\u2019s lack of conviction at both ends of the pitch, Mikel Arteta wondered what on earth he is going to do with Shkodran Mustafi and marvelled at the fearlessness of Gabriel Martinelli. It was that sort of night, absorbing and bonkers in equal measure, and in the end it was difficult to know whether to focus on Chelsea\u2019s sense of bewilderment or Arsenal\u2019s joy. For Lampard, the twist was tough to take but easy to explain. Chelsea played for more than an hour against 10 men, led twice and still dropped more points at home. They lacked creativity again, bolstering the argument that they need attacking reinforcements before the transfer window closes, and paid for their carelessness when Martinelli, an 18-year-old winger with a wonderfully direct style, hauled Arsenal level with a stunning solo goal just after the hour. Chelsea\u2019s imprecision is hurting their push for Champions League qualification \u2013 fifth-placed Manchester United will go three points behind them if they beat Burnley at home on Wednesday \u2013 and it spoke volumes that they were incapable of holding on after C\u00e9sar Azipilicueta restored their lead with six minutes left. Lampard\u2019s side are too loose and Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s indifferent form was captured by the moment when H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, cutting on to his left foot, rescued a point for Arsenal with a shot that somehow squirmed beyond Chelsea\u2019s goalkeeper. Arrizabalaga has conceded too many soft goals this season but Arteta was entitled to argue Arsenal merited a draw after a show of defiance in the second half. His side stood up to be counted after Mustafi\u2019s disastrous error led to David Luiz\u2019s red card on 26 minutes. Granit Xhaka excelled as a makeshift centre-half, Martinelli ran Azpilicueta ragged on the left and Arteta, who has lost only one of his seven games, was delighted with his new side\u2019s spirit on a ground where they have suffered in the past. Initially David Luiz was the story against his old side. There was no respectful celebration from the Brazilian when he scored here for Paris Saint-Germain in a Champions League tie in 2015 and he looked to make his presence felt from the start, attracting the ire of the Chelsea fans when he charged into the back of Tammy Abraham and kneed the striker up the backside. Battle lines had been drawn. Abraham would have the last laugh, though David Luiz\u2019s dismissal owed much to the brainlessness of Mustafi. While there have been signs of progress under Arteta, the fact remains the Spaniard has inherited a squad containing a multitude of weaknesses. There is only so much Arteta can improve with his work on the training ground and that was underlined by Mustafi\u2019s blunder. After a promising opening Chelsea simply had to wait for Arsenal\u2019s most unreliable player to self-destruct. Abraham had fooled Mustafi with a clever turn before scoring his side\u2019s late winner at the Emirates last month and this time he was in the right place when the centre-half sold Bernd Leno horribly short with a staggeringly incompetent back-pass. Abraham raced away, rounded Leno and went down following a desperate lunge from David Luiz. Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot and how the Chelsea fans chortled when they saw the referee reaching for his red card. David Luiz had denied Abraham a clear goalscoring opportunity and he departed with mocking chants ringing in his ears. All that was left was for Jorginho to tuck his penalty away, giving Chelsea a lead their enterprising football deserved. Yet Lampard, who hopes to beat Atl\u00e9tico Madrid to the signing of PSG\u2019s Edinson Cavani, would despair at Chelsea\u2019s inability to kill the game. While Callum Hudson-Odoi tested Leno with a rasping drive, they struggled to make the most of their numerical advantage. They lost their shape in midfield, where N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 had a disappointing game, and allowed Arsenal\u2019s belief to grow. The hosts flirted with disaster early in the second half, Arrizabalga almost playing Jorginho into trouble. Chelsea\u2019s game management was dismal and Arsenal, who looked blunt at first without the suspended Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, equalised in the 63rd minute. A Chelsea corner was cleared, Martinelli took possession in his own half, outpaced Emerson, raced clear after a slip from Kant\u00e9 and slipped the ball past Arrizabalaga. Lampard turned away in disgust. Chelsea are an infuriating side and they did not convince even after Azpilicueta turned Hudson-Odoi\u2019s cross past Leno. Arsenal fought and Lampard struggled to understand why his players turned down opportunities to put the ball out of play when Abraham went down with an ankle injury. The move progressed, Beller\u00edn drove inside and the Arsenal right-back\u2019s tame shot left Lampard fuming.",

Will Villa drop Watford back into the bottom three, will the Hornets pull themselves some way clear, or will neither of those things happen?</p> <p><strong>Bournemouth v Brighton</strong> \u2013 Not far off being the same, because Brighton really need to win a couple to stave off the threat of getting sucked into the mire. But Bournemouth\u2019s need is somewhat more desperate. This one is *big*.</p> <p><strong>Crystal Palace v Southampton</strong> \u2013 Palace are on a good run, albeit one mainly of draws, while Saints were until their unforeseen collapse against Wolves. Who\u2019s going to be on top of their game at Selhurst?</p> <p><strong>Everton v Newcastle</strong> \u2013 Two sides that sit snugly aside one another in mid-table, an eventuality that could well apply in May too.</p> <p><strong>Sheffield United v Manchester City</strong> \u2013 Another big one.

You\u2019ll note I have missed out <strong>Chelsea v Arsenal, which starts at 8.15pm</strong>. We will certainly keep an eye on that but Simon Burnton will have a separate MBM of it especially for you, the cool kids at the back. Blatant Chelsea v Arsenal bias!</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s full-time there! Chelsea 2-2 Arsenal. And it\u2019s full-time here too \u2013 thanks a lot for all your emails and tweets tonight, and for reading in general. It\u2019s been a lot of fun. See you soon! It\u2019s now Chelsea 2-2 Arsenal ... but you probably know that. Azpilicueta and Bellerin have traded goals in double-quick time. What a game that has turned into! Any thoughts on any of these games? Maybe you were at one! And finally, this from Villa\u2019s own late show: Here is Andy Hunter at Goodison \u2013 and what a fantastic report this is, given the scale of the late turnaround there: Ed Aarons, now, at Selhurst Park: And this is Ben Fisher at the Vitality Stadium: Match reports are coming through! Here is Paul Wilson\u2019s take from Bramall Lane: That Villa goal is being given to Mings by some parties \u2013 he tapped the ball to Konsa but then fell over the Konsa\u2019s shot may have glanced off him when he was grounded. Doubt they\u2019ll care overly. That was huge for them. Martinelli is one of the best 18-year-old forwards I have ever seen. Seriously. He has it. There are shades of Suarez and Batistuta. He is going all the way. Gabriel Martinelli has equalised for Arsenal\u2019s 10 men at Chelsea! Simon Burnton has more! Very, very hard to do justice to the scenes at the end in those games at Goodison and Villa Park. Everton had that game won, two goals up, in the last minute of stoppage time. Then Lejeune, who had never scored for Newcastle in 43 appearances, put two in! Utterly remarkable. His first was a cracking finish too. And that win for Villa, secured by a fairytale added-time strike by Konsa, ensures that they \u2013 like tonight\u2019s other big winners, Bournemouth \u2013 can believe again ... Sheffield United 0-1 Man City Everton 2-2 Newcastle (AND THE COMEBACK OF THE SEASON!) Aston Villa 2-1 Watford (STUNNING DRAMA THERE TOO) Palace 0-2 Saints Bournemouth 3-1 Brighton And Villa win theirs at the death! Konsa, another defender, strikes in brilliantly from the edge of the box after Mings - I think \u2013 tees him up! Remarkable scenes there! I don\u2019t believe it!!!!! He\u2019s done it again! There\u2019s an almighty scramble and Lejeune\u2019s shot crosses the line before Pickford can bundle it out \u2013 Newcastle, and the most unlikely of scorers, have pulled this right out of the fire in injury time. They go berserk!! It\u2019ll be too late, surely, but it\u2019s a very slick acrobatic finish by the defender after the hosts don\u2019t clear a corner properly. That was a hell of a battle, that, and you sense Pep knows that as he shakes hands with Wilder \u2013 both men smiling. TITLE RACE BACK ON!* *joke And some late, late pressure by the Blades at Bramall Lane but there\u2019s a minute of stoppage time to go. Aguero\u2019s goal will surely, surely decide this now ... Both sides knocking on the door for what would be a huge winner at Villa Park ... If Palace had a chance of pulling things round against Saints they probably don\u2019t now, as Connor Wickham has blazed a decent opportunity wide of the near post. Five minutes or so to go. Chelsea lead Arsenal - now minus David Luiz of course \u2013 1-0 at the break at Stamford Bridge A lifeline for the Seagulls? Mooy puts it in off the post and, via VAR check for handball, it is given ... Ryan Fraser curls just wide for Bournemouth, who have rode their luck at times defensively but looked so much more like their old selves going forward tonight. Laporte goes off at Bramall Lane but it looks more like cramp than anything else. A good return for him today. And at the other end Bournemouth make them pay! They spring from back to front and Wilson rounds Ryan to tap home \u2013 for his first league goal since 28 September! Brighton are really having a go at Bournemouth but cannot beat Ramsdale, who has just thwarted them *yet again*. He\u2019s ridiculous, isn\u2019t he? So is De Bruyne, who weights a delicious ball across from the right \u2013 impossible to defend really \u2013 that gives the substitute a chance he simply cannot miss. The Blades\u2019 good work goes up in smoke, just minutes after a big miss from close range McBurnie \u2013 who may or may not have been just offside. There\u2019s a goal, and potentially a big one in the relegation fight! Luiz crashes in at the back post after a left-sided shot is parried. The goals have dried up for now! Which means Everton, Bournemouth and Saints are all getting nearer to the points. They\u2019re all 2-0 up although Ramsdale has, again, made a decent save to nip Brighton\u2019s comeback hopes in the bud for now. Watford lead 1-0 at Villa and it\u2019s Blades 0-0 City going into the last 20. Brighton come close to a lifeline as Ramsdale bravely saves from Dunk. We are 65 minutes in there, and Graham Potter\u2019s side trail 2-0. This result would give them a little bit of a problem. The Blades might have one of those now as Aguero is on for Jesus ... Saints should seal the match at Palace but Long, in a similar position to that seemingly crucial Tosun miss from earlier, sidefoots straight at Guaita. A fine Blades move sees Basham get to the line and see his cutback fingertipped out by Ederson to the sub Mousset ... who goes for an elaborate backheel, which the keeper saves, rather than laying the ball off for a totally open \u2013 and subsequently furious \u2013 Fleck! And it\u2019s nearly 3-0 for Bournemouth, Ryan denying Billing smartly. They are half an hour away from the points they so desperately require. Not quite sure how Watford haven\u2019t scored a second at Villa Park there but Nyland has just made a quite superb double save from Deeney. Over at Stamford Bridge, David Luiz has been sent off for Arsenal and Jorginho has converted a spot-kick for Chelsea ... 1-0 there. Digne slots Calvert-Lewin, who is improving a lot these days, in and he swipes a clinical left-footed finish across Dubravka. City finding it harder to create chances early in the second half at Bramall Lane. The Blades are such a tough, tough side to face. As things stand, Southampton \u2013 a team beaten 9-0 at home a few weeks back \u2013 go into the top half. At Goodison, Bernard has a chance for 2-0 but dinks just over ... Saints\u2019 second pearler of the game! Armstrong takes possession 25 yards out, has a touch, and then whips a wonderful effort past Guaita and into the corner! Everton threatening a second against Newcastle, for whom Dubravka diverts a dangerous left-sided centre away. It\u2019s Chelsea 0-0 Arsenal after about 15 minutes there by the way, but Arsenal are yet to really get started by all accounts. Strap right in ... All we want is consistency (and for VAR to be flung in the bin, no matter the rights or wrongs here). Tom Hopkins is another among the Henderson fanclub: \u201cI was (fairly randomly) at Wembley for the play off final while Dean Henderson was on loan at Shrewsbury. He certainly looked the real deal that day, I\u2019m wondering when Southgate is going to have a look \u2013 none of his other options seem entirely compelling?\u201d Bit of a scuffle as they go off at Selhurst! It\u2019s Zaha vs Ward-Prowse. Not quite sure what happened there but there were fingers jabbed and pointed, particularly on Zaha\u2019s side. Sheffield United 0-0 Man City (Jesus missed pen) Crystal Palace 0-1 Southampton Bournemouth 2-0 Brighton Aston Villa 0-1 Watford Everton 1-0 Newcastle Get your assessments in! A smart counter almost sees the Cherries granted a chance to make it three \u2013 Brighton are, all of a sudden, absolutely all over the show. A corner is swung in from the Bournemouth right and is allowed to bounce right in front of goal. Billing challenges Gross and it\u2019s the Brighton man it ricochets off, by the looks of things. What a turnaround for Eddie Howe! Well we have goals now, don\u2019t we? And a missed penalty in the goalless game. Nearing half-time in them all but the drama is ratcheting up ... A slick move down the right, Deulofeu\u2019s ball in, Deeney\u2019s bullet of a header, and Nigel Pearson can do absolutely no wrong at the moment. The Liverpool loanee drives in a fine finish to \u2013 maybe, just maybe - reignite Bournemouth\u2019s season! On that last point \u2013 I\u2019m reliably advised by Philip Cornwall that, as Henderson salvaged the ball himself rather than a defender clearing, the encroachment thing isn\u2019t relevant. I have been at games this season where the amount of home encroachment at that penalty would have led to VAR and a retake ... What a noise! Bramall Lane goes mad as Henderson dives to his right and bats it away ... adding fuel to the earlier argument! Mahrez appears to have run into trouble but is then scythed down by a totally unnecessary Basham tackle ... Moise Kean\u2019s first goal for Everton! It comes from a spell of patient possession, which then speeds up when Bernard \u2013 I think \u2013 sends the forward through. He finishes clinically, down the middle of the goal, and the Ancelotti revoluton continues! Neal Maupay has just been thwarted by a fine Aaron Ramsdale save at Bournemouth. A lifeline in the hosts\u2019 relegation battle? Brighton shading it there. Almost 2-0 to Saints, who are starting to play some lovely stuff. Guaita has just flipped an Armstrong effort over his crossbar. Henderson has just thwarted Man City superbly for a second time and I have to say I\u2019m close to agreeing with this: No clear opportunities at Villa Park yet, although there are crosses being aimed into the box at either end whenever I glance at it. Villa just squandered a fairly useful free-kick to the right of the box. The night\u2019s scoring begins with a searing 20-yard finish from Redmond, who works space before fairly lashing the ball into the far corner! Great hit. If you didn\u2019t believe me ... And a big miss from Cenk Tosun at Selhurst! He\u2019s sent clear by some horrid Saints defending but, with time to size up the target from a central position, absolutely skies it! Still goalless everywhere. That\u2019s a chance for Man City though, 19 minutes in. A Mahrez pass finds Sterling, who finishes first time ... but is denied by a superb parry from Dean Henderson! Little in the way of big chances in any of our games so far. Bournemouth have the chance to put a useful set-piece in the box against Brighton but Ake can\u2019t turn it back towards the centre after it\u2019s played beyond the far post. Laporte will be OK, fortunately. There was some considerable distaste from the away end at that tackle given Laporte\u2019s recent absence. A yellow for Besic but a red face, really. Naughty from Mo Besic at Bramall Lane! A proper \u201cwelcome back\u201d to Laporte, which was late and rash. Laporte is down and this does not look too good at the moment ... Everton are flashing balls across the box against Newcastle, one of them from Theo Walcott just deflecting behind a poised Dominic Calvert-Lewin. No goals anywhere yet but a feisty start from the Blades against City. Brighton, meanwhile, are on the attack early on at Bournemouth ... Bournemouth fan Paul Sheppard writes: \u201cTotally backing Howe even though something is very wrong at the moment as the last few performances have been like the darkest days of supporting the club. Essentially teams have sussed how to negate our playing style but Howe should be afforded the same opportunity that Dyche was given and the opportunity to bring us straight back up if we do go down. Personally, I would also enjoy a season in the Championship which is probably for the best as I fear it will be too late to salvage the situation by the time Brooks and King return to fitness.\u201d Tonight\u2019s games are underway ... A couple of interesting points from tonight\u2019s team news, as listed earlier. Aymeric Laporte is BACK for Manchester City after his five-month absence, while Southampton have rested Danny Ings at Palace. This is why we need Twitter. The 7.30 kick-off time makes a huge difference for our reporters at those games, who do not quite have the pressure required of a 7.45 or \u2013 far worse - 8pm. So prayers with our men at Stamford Bridge, in that case. I\u2019m at Spurs v Norwich tomorrow, which is a 7.30, and having been through the mill of an 8.15 back in December I\u2019ll take it. Earlier, your friend and mine Paul Wilson joined Pep Guardiola in suggesting the League Cup is scrapped. Surely not! Do you agree? There is life outside the \u201cEPL\u201d. The African World Cup qualifying draw was made an hour or so back and here it is ... some cracking groups in there! The winners go into play-offs, whose winners go to ... Qatar. If you wanted to see Everton\u2019s lineup in cartoon form you are, errrr, in luck (thanks to Colin Flint for the spot). What\u2019s your game of the night? From our gang of 7.30s it has to be the one at Bournemouth, doesn\u2019t it? If any of their fans are reading, I\u2019d love to hear your take on the current situation. Still 100% behind Eddie Howe, right? You know I told you Simon Burnton has set up a rival MBM of Chelsea-Arsenal? He\u2019s only gone and launched it!

You know what, I thought tonight\u2019s games were on Amazon but they actually aren\u2019t. And if that opening gambit doesn\u2019t lure you in, reader, nothing will! We have five 7.30pm (if you\u2019re in the GMT) kick-offs, which are a reasonably new thing in the Modern Era, and they are as follows: Aston Villa v Watford \u2013 A proper relegation six-pointer.

Bournemouth v Brighton \u2013 Not far off being the same, because Brighton really need to win a couple to stave off the threat of getting sucked into the mire. But Bournemouth\u2019s need is somewhat more desperate. This one is *big*. Crystal Palace v Southampton \u2013 Palace are on a good run, albeit one mainly of draws, while Saints were until their unforeseen collapse against Wolves. Who\u2019s going to be on top of their game at Selhurst? Everton v Newcastle \u2013 Two sides that sit snugly aside one another in mid-table, an eventuality that could well apply in May too. Sheffield United v Manchester City \u2013 Another big one. Pep\u2019s men Won\u2019t Fancy This, while the Blades managed to draw at Arsenal and annoy their own manager in one fell swoop on Saturday. We\u2019ll try to stay on top of all five! Please send in your hopes, fears and dreams for them \u2013 or just check in and say hello. You\u2019ll note I have missed out Chelsea v Arsenal, which starts at 8.15pm. We will certainly keep an eye on that but Simon Burnton will have a separate MBM of it especially for you, the cool kids at the back. Blatant Chelsea v Arsenal bias!",

      "bodyText": "Lawyers for a Chinese telecoms executive arrested in Vancouver have argued that her extradition to the US would allow a foreign state to criminalize behavior in Canada. Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei and eldest daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, is wanted by US authorities for alleged fraud related to sanctions against Iran. In the second day of a five-day extradition hearing in Vancouver, lawyers for Meng argued that the US accusations against her would not be considered a crime in Canada, where she was arrested in 2018. \u201cCanada doesn\u2019t enforce foreign criminal law,\u201d said Meng\u2019s lawyer Eric Gottardi. \u201cWe simply cannot import that law and have it operate in Canada domestically. It\u2019s contrary to our values.\u201d The US alleges Meng lied to the bank HSBC about Huawei\u2019s relationship with its Iran-based affiliate Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Tehran. On Monday, defense attorneys argued that the US was abusing its treaty with Canada by asking it to detain Meng for prosecution as part of a campaign that Ren, Huawei\u2019s chief executive, surmised aimed to crush China\u2019s largest international company. They argued that Meng\u2019s misrepresentations, if they occurred, did not amount to fraud, and that Canada had repudiated the US sanctions against Iran. \u201cWould we be here in the absence of US sanctions? Our response is no,\u201d Richard Peck, the lead defense lawyer, told a packed courtroom. The hearing is scheduled to last until Friday. Meng\u2019s arrest during a stopover of a Hong Kong-to-Mexico flight in December 2018 placed her at the center of a US-China trade row, with Donald Trump once musing that he would gladly trade her release for Chinese trade concessions. It also put Canada in the middle of the feud between the US and China, with which Justin Trudeau had hoped to nurture closer economic ties. Nine days after Meng was taken into custody at the Vancouver airport, China arrested two Canadians \u2013 the former diplomat Michael Kovrig and the businessman Michael Spavor. Their detentions on espionage suspicions, along with Chinese restrictions on Canadian agricultural imports, have been widely interpreted as retribution by Beijing aimed at pressuring Canada to free Meng. Former Canadian political leaders have urged the prime minister to concede and release Meng in a \u201cprisoner swap\u201d for Kovrig and Spavor. But extradition experts consulted by AFP said that that would encourage \u201chostage diplomacy\u201d. China\u2019s foreign ministry on Monday characterized Meng\u2019s extradition case as a \u201cgrave political incident\u201d, while renewing calls for Ottawa to release her to normalize relations. Canada\u2019s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, responded that Ottawa \u201chonors its extradition treaty commitments\u201d and would not interfere in the case while it was before the courts. In a statement, Huawei said that it trusted Canada\u2019s judicial system and believed Meng would be found innocent.",

The hosts were cruising towards a third win in three home Premier League games until a chaotic finale fuelled by weak goalkeeping from Jordan Pickford, poor game management, careless defending and Newcastle\u2019s refusal to concede defeat. The tale should have been one of redemption for Moise Kean, the 19-year-old striker who scored his first Everton goal in his 22nd appearance for the club and produced a display that earned a standing ovation from the Goodison Park crowd. The match also provided another demonstration of Dominic Calvert-Lewin\u2019s growing prowess as he scored his 12th goal of the campaign but it will be remembered for Everton conspiring to find another ridiculous way to squander points, confidence and momentum.

Her health problems are not being addressed, and the prolonged confinement and isolation is taking its toll on her mental health. She\u2019s pleaded for lawyer visits and books and money to buy basic necessities. Evin prison is notorious for its bad conditions that both foreign and Iranian political prisoners have faced for years.\u201d</p> <p>Pearson said Iran had a long history of using foreign nationals as bargaining chips to resolve diplomatic disputes \u2013 \u201cfrom what we know so far, it clearly seems that Kylie\u2019s detention is political\u201d.</p> <p>She said Moore-Gilbert\u2019s physical and mental health was deteriorating badly in detention and the government needed to escalate its response.</p> <p>\u201cThe Australian government should publicly and privately call for Kylie\u2019s immediate release. The government should demarche the Iranian ambassador about their lack of consular access to Kylie and the myriad due process violations in her case. It is unacceptable to hold an Australian hostage like this.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps the Australian government has been doing a lot behind closed doors, but if the quiet approach isn\u2019t working, then it\u2019s time to switch gears. Kylie herself has made it very clear in her letters that she wants the Australian government to act.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Moore-Gilbert\u2019s case was a \u201cvery high priority\u201d for the government, and that foreign affairs minister Marise Payne had repeatedly raised the case with her Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif, most recently at a meeting on 16 January in New Delhi.</p> <p>The Australian government has consistently said it rejects the spying allegations against Moore-Gilbert and the legitimacy of her conviction and sentence.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we continue to work towards her release, we are doing everything possible in relation to the conditions of her imprisonment.</p> <p>\u201cThat includes reinforcing that consular officials from each of our countries have the right to visit and communicate with detained nationals without unreasonable delay.</p> <p>The spokesman said the fact Moore-Gilbert had been allowed two consular visits in recent two months - after spending months without any contact at all \u2013 was \u201can example of important progress\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe continue to believe that the best way to secure a successful outcome is through diplomatic channels and not through the media.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/21/zaghari-ratcliffe-court-hearing-over-400m-iran-debt-may-hasten-release\">Zaghari-Ratcliffe: court hearing over \u00a3400m Iran debt may hasten release</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the New York-based <a href=\"https://iranhumanrights.org/\">Center for Human Rights in Iran</a>, told the Guardian foreign ministers from countries whose nationals were imprisoned in Iran should make their citizens\u2019 safety their top priority in dealing with Iranian officials.</p> <p>\u201cBeing silent or tiptoeing around the situation gives a green light to Iran\u2019s judiciary and intelligence establishment to keep trampling on people\u2019s rights with no accountability.\u201d</p> <p>Ghaemi said Moore-Gilbert should have been moved out of isolation in July 2019 when she was sentenced, \u201cyet she remains there seven months later at the mercy of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 intelligence agents\u201d.</p> <p>Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of jailed British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is also currently in Evin prison, said that western governments\u2019 insistence on quiet diplomatic efforts over its citizens detained in Iran had proven futile, and a harder line with Tehran was needed.</p> <p>\u201cThe abuse that Kylie has been through is shocking. All the more that this has happened without protest. The failure to put down red lines has not got anyone home, and it has not made Australian or British citizens any safer.

Moore-Gilbert, imprisoned since September 2018 and sentenced to 10 years on charges of espionage, wrote that she rebuffed an offer from Iran to recruit her as a spy for Tehran in exchange for her release. \u201cI am not a spy,\u201d she wrote to a prison authority. \u201cI have never been a spy and I have no interest to work for a spying organisation in any country.

Evin prison is notorious for its bad conditions that both foreign and Iranian political prisoners have faced for years.\u201d Pearson said Iran had a long history of using foreign nationals as bargaining chips to resolve diplomatic disputes \u2013 \u201cfrom what we know so far, it clearly seems that Kylie\u2019s detention is political\u201d. She said Moore-Gilbert\u2019s physical and mental health was deteriorating badly in detention and the government needed to escalate its response. \u201cThe Australian government should publicly and privately call for Kylie\u2019s immediate release. The government should demarche the Iranian ambassador about their lack of consular access to Kylie and the myriad due process violations in her case. It is unacceptable to hold an Australian hostage like this. \u201cPerhaps the Australian government has been doing a lot behind closed doors, but if the quiet approach isn\u2019t working, then it\u2019s time to switch gears. Kylie herself has made it very clear in her letters that she wants the Australian government to act.\u201d A spokesman for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Moore-Gilbert\u2019s case was a \u201cvery high priority\u201d for the government, and that foreign affairs minister Marise Payne had repeatedly raised the case with her Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif, most recently at a meeting on 16 January in New Delhi. The Australian government has consistently said it rejects the spying allegations against Moore-Gilbert and the legitimacy of her conviction and sentence. \u201cWhile we continue to work towards her release, we are doing everything possible in relation to the conditions of her imprisonment. \u201cThat includes reinforcing that consular officials from each of our countries have the right to visit and communicate with detained nationals without unreasonable delay. The spokesman said the fact Moore-Gilbert had been allowed two consular visits in recent two months - after spending months without any contact at all \u2013 was \u201can example of important progress\u201d. \u201cWe continue to believe that the best way to secure a successful outcome is through diplomatic channels and not through the media.\u201d Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran, told the Guardian foreign ministers from countries whose nationals were imprisoned in Iran should make their citizens\u2019 safety their top priority in dealing with Iranian officials. \u201cBeing silent or tiptoeing around the situation gives a green light to Iran\u2019s judiciary and intelligence establishment to keep trampling on people\u2019s rights with no accountability.\u201d Ghaemi said Moore-Gilbert should have been moved out of isolation in July 2019 when she was sentenced, \u201cyet she remains there seven months later at the mercy of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 intelligence agents\u201d. Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of jailed British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is also currently in Evin prison, said that western governments\u2019 insistence on quiet diplomatic efforts over its citizens detained in Iran had proven futile, and a harder line with Tehran was needed. \u201cThe abuse that Kylie has been through is shocking. All the more that this has happened without protest. The failure to put down red lines has not got anyone home, and it has not made Australian or British citizens any safer. It has enabled an increasingly emboldened form of state hostage-taking by the Iranian regime, marketed by foreign minister Zarif.\u201d Ratcliffe is scheduled to meet with British prime minister Boris Johnson on Thursday. As foreign secretary in 2017, Johnson told a Commons committee that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was \u201cteaching people journalism\u201d in Iran. The statement was untrue, but Johnson\u2019s words were cited by Iranian officials as evidence that she had engaged in \u201cpropaganda against the regime\u201d. Ratcliffe said the UK and Australian governments had failed to protect their citizens in a time of extreme vulnerability. \u201cThe Australian and British governments have fallen short with Kylie in many ways \u2013 but it is the failure to ensure adequate food or money or clothes or even calls to her parents that really struck me. This is an innocent person caught in the middle of a government game of chess. If the embassy can\u2019t ensure you have enough to eat in the middle of all their high-level diplomacy, then what are they actually doing? What are they actually for?\u201d",

Armstrong has performed well in the inside-forward role since Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s switch to his favoured 4-2-2-2 and his long-range effort that swerved viciously into the corner gave Guaita no chance. Shane Long spurned a great opportunity to seal the points soon after, while Redmond also tested the Palace goalkeeper again from distance.</p> <p>Hodgson brought on Connor Wickham in place of Tosun late on but a lack of incisiveness seems to be contagious among Palace strikers these days as his only effort sailed high and wide of the target. Their manager will be thankful their FA Cup exit to Derby means they can rest some weary limbs this weekend after seven games in 26 days.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t use that as an excuse, because we\u2019ve had the same amount of rest as the other teams,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about the transfer market but rather about getting some of our regulars back.

      "bodyText": "Crystal Palace became the latest victims of Southampton\u2019s purple patch as goals either side of half-time from Nathan Redmond and Stuart Armstrong saw Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side record a fourth away victory in succession in the Premier League. On a night that Wilfried Zaha renewed hostilities with James Ward-Prowse, a lethargic and weary Palace were totally outclassed, with Southampton moving above them into the top half of the table and within three points of fifth place having looked certainties for a relegation dogfight just a few weeks ago. It could have been even worse for Roy Hodgson had VAR decided to send off Zaha after he seemed to make contact with Ward-Prowse\u2019s eye during an ugly spat as the players left the field at half-time. But having remained unbeaten in the league since the defeat to Newcastle on 21 December, the Palace manager could have no complaints about this result against opponents who have now matched their achievement away from home under Ronald Koeman in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy to win here but the way we played was one of our best performances this season,\u201d said Hasenh\u00fcttl, who reserved special praise for his two goalscorers. \u201cWhen we jump in our yellow trousers for away games we really enjoy playing for our fans. We are very brave and not scared of anything.\u201d Southampton were without two of the most influential figures behind their recent revival, with the defender Jan Bednarek missing through injury and Danny Ings surprisingly left on the bench. That meant a first league start since the end of November for the Denmark defender Jannik Vestergaard, while Irish teenager Michael Obafemi was given the opportunity to reprise his match-winning performance in the victory over Chelsea on Boxing Day. Hodgson must have been relieved to see in-form Ings left out for a team who have accumulated the highest proportion of their points away from home in the whole division. That has been Palace\u2019s speciality in recent seasons but four wins and four draws from 11 home matches have been the key to their lofty position in the table, even if Hodgson\u2019s side have still found the net only once in the first half at home this season. Yet after scoring against Manchester City on his debut at the weekend, Cenk Tosun will still not quite believe he failed to take the opportunity presented to him when Vestergaard inexplicably lost possession in the 18th minute. Palace were made to pay almost immediately as Redmond turned Martin Kelly on the edge of the area before firing an unstoppable shot past Vicente Guaita. The goalkeeper then had to be alert to divert Armstrong\u2019s effort over the bar, with Palace struggling to test the stand-in right-back Ward-Prowse after Cedric Soares had limped off just before the goal. There was a heated exchange between Zaha and Ward-Prowse as they left the pitch at half-time, with the Palace forward appearing to almost poke his opponent in the eye as he wagged his finger. They had to be kept apart as they went down the tunnel, but after the referee, Andre Marriner, had attempted to call both players back on to the pitch, VAR decided there was no violent conduct. Their feud stretches back to last season\u2019s 1-1 draw at St Mary\u2019s when Zaha was awarded a second caution for applauding Marriner\u2019s decision not to award a foul on him against Ward-Prowse, although this time he could count himself lucky to stay on the pitch. Any hopes Palace could find a way back into the game were virtually extinguished three minutes after the restart. Armstrong has performed well in the inside-forward role since Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s switch to his favoured 4-2-2-2 and his long-range effort that swerved viciously into the corner gave Guaita no chance. Shane Long spurned a great opportunity to seal the points soon after, while Redmond also tested the Palace goalkeeper again from distance. Hodgson brought on Connor Wickham in place of Tosun late on but a lack of incisiveness seems to be contagious among Palace strikers these days as his only effort sailed high and wide of the target. Their manager will be thankful their FA Cup exit to Derby means they can rest some weary limbs this weekend after seven games in 26 days. \u201cWe can\u2019t use that as an excuse, because we\u2019ve had the same amount of rest as the other teams,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about the transfer market but rather about getting some of our regulars back. That will be almost like having new players.\u201d",

But Abdulaziz fears his messages to Khashoggi could have given insights to the people who would later kill him.</p> \n<p>He was not alone. Two other dissidents, the London-based <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/28/saudi-arabia-accused-of-hacking-london-based-dissident-ghanem-almasarir\">satirist Ghanem Almasarir</a>, and <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2018/10/the-kingdom-came-to-canada-how-saudi-linked-digital-espionage-reached-canadian-soil/\">Yahya Assiri</a>, a dissident who was in frequent contact with Khashoggi, were also alleged by experts to have been targeted by Saudi cyber threats in that period.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Certain powerful people will wrongly conclude I am their enemy\u2019</h2> \n<p>Two months after the killing on 2 October 2018, another story emerged. It was seemingly unrelated to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and was far more salacious.</p> \n<p>On 10 January 2019, the National Enquirer published a special edition that exposed Bezos had had an affair.</p> \n<p>More than a dozen other articles followed across various AMI publications, in what seemed to be a campaign against the CEO.</p> \n<p>The story of the extramarital relationship included intimate details \u2013 including the text messages he had sent to his girlfriend months earlier, text messages that were sent just days after Bezos\u2019s mobile phone had been sent the WhatsApp message with the malicious file.</p> \n<p>Trump, an ardent critic of Bezos, the Washington Post, and Amazon, who was alleged in a media report to be \u201cobsessed\u201d with Amazon, appeared to revel in the news.</p> \n<p> \u201cSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHopefully the paper will soon be placed in better &amp; more responsible hands!\u201d</p> \n<p>The story did not end there. A few weeks later, on 7 February, Bezos published an <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">extraordinary blogpost</a> titled: \u201cNo thank you, Mr. Pecker\u201d<strong> </strong>in which he described an elaborate \u201cextortion\u201d attempt by the owner of the National Enquirer, which had threatened in emails to publish intimate photographs of Bezos and of his girlfriend if the CEO did not agree to stop an investigation into how the National Enquirer had obtained its information.</p> \n<p>AMI insisted that it had not been<em> </em>\u201cinstigated, dictated or influenced in any manner by external forces, political or otherwise\u201d.</p> \n<p>Bezos rejected the offer and published the email correspondence between them \u2013 which included a series of embarrassing descriptions of the photographs AMI alleged it possessed. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cPresident Trump is one of those people, obvious by his many tweets. Also, the Post\u2019s essential and unrelenting coverage of the murder of its columnist Jamal Khashoggi is undoubtedly unpopular in certain circles.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other experts also weighed in. John Brennan, the former CIA director and CIA station chief in Riyadh, commented on MSNBC: \u201cI have no doubt, given the Post\u2019s relentless and appropriate condemnation of MBS for the killing of Khashoggi, that he would try to discredit, embarrass and hurt Bezos financially if he could.\u201d</p> \n<p>A few weeks later, Bezos\u2019s head of security, Gavin de Becker, published his own <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-investigation-finds-the-saudis-obtained-his-private-information\">editorial in the Daily Beast</a>, claiming that his investigation into the National Enquirer leaks had concluded that Saudi Arabia had accessed Bezos\u2019s phone. He declined to publish any further details, but said he had given information about his investigation into the National Enquirer leaks to law enforcement officials. Both Saudi Arabia and Pecker\u2019s AMI flatly denied the allegation and any suggestion that Saudi Arabia was involved in the matter.</p> \n<p>Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst and Saudi expert, said the potential \u201chack\u201d of Bezos\u2019s phone reflected the possibility of Saudi\u2019s premeditation.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can connect the dots now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey actually weaponised this hack into Bezos\u2019s phone to publicly air some very intimate parts of his life story, I assume in an attempt to slander and smear him\u2026.[thinking] they might need dirt on him later on.\u201d</p> \n<p>It ultimately reflected a lack of understanding of how the US works, Riedel said, and how the Washington Post owner would react to such a threat. He also said the episode raised questions about what US intelligence agents may have known about the hack. It was another example, he said, of how the Trump administration had failed to hold MBS and the Saudis accountable for their alleged abuses.</p> \n<p>Last October, Bezos stood in front of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and paid tribute to Khashoggi at a vigil to commemorate the one-year anniversary of his murder.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo one should ever have to endure what you did,\u201d he said to Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee. \u201cYou paced that street for hours, pacing and waiting. And he never came out. It\u2019s unimaginable. And you need to know that you are in our hearts. We are here and you\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both Saudi Arabia and AMI have <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/national-enquirer-says-saudis-didnt-help-on-bezos-story\">denied that the kingdom</a> was involved in the publication of the Bezos story.</p> \n<p>A lawyer for Bezos who was contacted by the Guardian said: \u201cI have no comment on this except to say that Mr Bezos is cooperating with investigations.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Guardian asked the Saudi embassy in Washington about the claims. It did not immediately return a request for comment.</p> \n<p><em>Have you got new information about this story? You can message Guardian investigations using Signal or WhatsApp: +447584640566.

      "bodyText": "Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of the Washington Post, had no reason to be suspicious when he received a WhatsApp message from the account of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia in May 2018. Bezos and Mohammed bin Salman had attended a dinner together in Hollywood a few weeks earlier hosted by Brian Grazer, the Oscar-winning producer, and Ari Emanuel, the powerful talent agent, as part of the young crown prince\u2019s tour of America, which was hailed by some observers as an effort to rebrand the kingdom and set it on a new course. The then 32-year-old Saudi heir, known all over the world as \u201cMBS\u201d, had been greeted with open arms from Los Angeles to New York \u2013 with stops at the White House, MIT and Harvard. He had rubbed shoulders with celebrities ranging from Oprah to Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson. It appeared to be a PR coup for the crown prince, who had previously been criticised by human rights campaigners about his decision to wage a bloody war in Yemen \u2013 and also the alleged imprisonment and torture of rich Saudis at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh. Amazon had even been in talks about the possibility of opening data centres in Saudi Arabia. The dinner engagement could have been the start of a promising relationship between two of the world\u2019s most powerful men. But it would swiftly turn sour \u2013 and in spectacular fashion. According to sources who have spoken to the Guardian, the message sent to Bezos on that Tuesday 1 May from the personal account of the crown prince contained a video file \u2013 of what, it is not clear. But a forensic technical analysis of the file has found that it is \u201chighly probable\u201d it contained malware that penetrated Bezos\u2019s mobile phone and exfiltrated a large amount of data within hours. Bezos, it seems, had been hacked. The Guardian has no knowledge about the precise nature of the material that was allegedly taken or what was done with it. But this apparent targeting of Bezos\u2019s phone appears to fit into a broader pattern of behaviour by Saudi Arabia. The crown prince and his inner circle have been criticised for attempting to undermine real and perceived critics of his regime all over the world. Was Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post, the paper that employed the eloquent Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, considered one of them? Certainly, among all of the perceived enemies of the crown prince, Khashoggi was considered one of the most dangerous. His knowledge of the royal court \u2013 he had once worked within it \u2013 and the platform then afforded him by such a respected newspaper, gave his articles real weight. And this was causing great agitation inside the royal court. According to a New York Times report in 2019, MBS was growing \u201cincreasingly alarmed\u201d by Khashoggi\u2019s criticisms during this period. In September 2017, just as Khashoggi wrote that Saudi Arabia was becoming \u201cunbearable\u201d because of its repression, the young prince privately told an aide that he would use a \u201cbullet\u201d on Khashoggi, according to current and former US and foreign officials cited by the New York Times. At nearly the same time, the crown prince was developing a relationship with a different American publisher who would print a far more flattering portrait of the Saudi heir. According to the New York Times, in September 2017, MBS met David Pecker, the chief executive of American Media Inc (AMI), the owner of the National Enquirer supermarket tabloid, in Saudi Arabia. Pecker is an important player in Washington. Two months earlier he had had a private dinner with Donald Trump in the White House. Among the other guests was Kacy Grine, a financier who reportedly served as an advisor to Saudi royals. Pecker and Trump were longtime allies. A Department of Justice investigation would later reveal that Pecker had played a critical role in helping the Trump campaign to \u201ckill\u201d negative stories about the then-candidate\u2019s extramarital affairs and pay hush money to women who were interested in telling their stories. When MBS flew to the US for his maiden trip as crown prince in March of the following year, it was Pecker\u2019s company that published a glossy magazine hailing him as a great leader who would transform the world. Pecker, Grine, and MBS met for a second time during the crown prince\u2019s stay in New York. A few weeks after the alleged Bezos hack, another suspected cyber attack was launched. The target was an influential Saudi dissident who was living in Canada and was a close friend of Khashoggi. According to an analysis by the independent research group Citizen Lab, Omar Abdulaziz received a fake infected link about a delivery he was expecting in late June 2018 that contained malware that infiltrated his phone. The Guardian understands Khashoggi and Abdulaziz traded \u201chundreds\u201d of messages in the months that followed. Abdulaziz has claimed in a lawsuit that his communications were probably intercepted by Saudi Arabia \u2013 an allegation the kingdom has denied. But Abdulaziz fears his messages to Khashoggi could have given insights to the people who would later kill him. He was not alone. Two other dissidents, the London-based satirist Ghanem Almasarir, and Yahya Assiri, a dissident who was in frequent contact with Khashoggi, were also alleged by experts to have been targeted by Saudi cyber threats in that period. \u2018Certain powerful people will wrongly conclude I am their enemy\u2019 Two months after the killing on 2 October 2018, another story emerged. It was seemingly unrelated to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and was far more salacious. On 10 January 2019, the National Enquirer published a special edition that exposed Bezos had had an affair. More than a dozen other articles followed across various AMI publications, in what seemed to be a campaign against the CEO. The story of the extramarital relationship included intimate details \u2013 including the text messages he had sent to his girlfriend months earlier, text messages that were sent just days after Bezos\u2019s mobile phone had been sent the WhatsApp message with the malicious file. Trump, an ardent critic of Bezos, the Washington Post, and Amazon, who was alleged in a media report to be \u201cobsessed\u201d with Amazon, appeared to revel in the news. \u201cSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHopefully the paper will soon be placed in better &amp; more responsible hands!\u201d The story did not end there. A few weeks later, on 7 February, Bezos published an extraordinary blogpost titled: \u201cNo thank you, Mr. Pecker\u201d in which he described an elaborate \u201cextortion\u201d attempt by the owner of the National Enquirer, which had threatened in emails to publish intimate photographs of Bezos and of his girlfriend if the CEO did not agree to stop an investigation into how the National Enquirer had obtained its information. AMI insisted that it had not been \u201cinstigated, dictated or influenced in any manner by external forces, political or otherwise\u201d. Bezos rejected the offer and published the email correspondence between them \u2013 which included a series of embarrassing descriptions of the photographs AMI alleged it possessed. \u201cIt\u2019s unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cPresident Trump is one of those people, obvious by his many tweets. Also, the Post\u2019s essential and unrelenting coverage of the murder of its columnist Jamal Khashoggi is undoubtedly unpopular in certain circles.\u201d Other experts also weighed in. John Brennan, the former CIA director and CIA station chief in Riyadh, commented on MSNBC: \u201cI have no doubt, given the Post\u2019s relentless and appropriate condemnation of MBS for the killing of Khashoggi, that he would try to discredit, embarrass and hurt Bezos financially if he could.\u201d A few weeks later, Bezos\u2019s head of security, Gavin de Becker, published his own editorial in the Daily Beast, claiming that his investigation into the National Enquirer leaks had concluded that Saudi Arabia had accessed Bezos\u2019s phone. He declined to publish any further details, but said he had given information about his investigation into the National Enquirer leaks to law enforcement officials. Both Saudi Arabia and Pecker\u2019s AMI flatly denied the allegation and any suggestion that Saudi Arabia was involved in the matter. Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst and Saudi expert, said the potential \u201chack\u201d of Bezos\u2019s phone reflected the possibility of Saudi\u2019s premeditation. \u201cWe can connect the dots now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey actually weaponised this hack into Bezos\u2019s phone to publicly air some very intimate parts of his life story, I assume in an attempt to slander and smear him\u2026.[thinking] they might need dirt on him later on.\u201d It ultimately reflected a lack of understanding of how the US works, Riedel said, and how the Washington Post owner would react to such a threat. He also said the episode raised questions about what US intelligence agents may have known about the hack. It was another example, he said, of how the Trump administration had failed to hold MBS and the Saudis accountable for their alleged abuses. Last October, Bezos stood in front of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and paid tribute to Khashoggi at a vigil to commemorate the one-year anniversary of his murder. \u201cNo one should ever have to endure what you did,\u201d he said to Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee. \u201cYou paced that street for hours, pacing and waiting. And he never came out. It\u2019s unimaginable. And you need to know that you are in our hearts. We are here and you\u2019re not alone.\u201d Both Saudi Arabia and AMI have denied that the kingdom was involved in the publication of the Bezos story. A lawyer for Bezos who was contacted by the Guardian said: \u201cI have no comment on this except to say that Mr Bezos is cooperating with investigations.\u201d The Guardian asked the Saudi embassy in Washington about the claims. It did not immediately return a request for comment. Have you got new information about this story? You can message Guardian investigations using Signal or WhatsApp: +447584640566.

      "bodyText": "More than $1m in sport grants was handed to nine clubs that boast senior Coalition MPs as members or patrons, including one undisclosed by Bridget McKenzie, three linked to Indigenous affairs minister Ken Wyatt, one tied to treasurer and deputy Liberal leader Josh Frydenberg, and two associated with senator Sarah Henderson. The controversial $100m grant program gave money to a gun club joined by the former sports minister, a tennis club where Frydenberg is an honorary member, an Australian rules football club where Wyatt is the \u201cNo 1 ticket holder\u201d, and Henderson\u2019s football and netball club, which made personal representations for the funding to prime minister Scott Morrison. The memberships are listed in MPs\u2019 register of interests as affiliations where \u201ca conflict of interest with a member\u2019s public duties could foreseeably arise or be seen to arise\u201d \u2013 with the exception of the Wangaratta Clay Target Club which received $35,980 but was not listed on McKenzie\u2019s register of interests. The club received funding to install new toilets and amenities. It boasted McKenzie had \u201csigned up to our club as a full fee-paying member\u201d when she visited the club on 25 January 2019 to announce funding alongside Nationals candidate Mark Byatt who was contesting the independent-held seat of Indi. A spokeswoman for McKenzie told The Age that since the membership was a \u201cgift\u201d in January 2019 and valued at less than $300 a declaration to the Senate was \u201cunnecessary\u201d. Most other MPs told Guardian Australia they did no more than alert clubs in their area to the grants on offer, although Henderson wrote a letter of support in favour of one successful club. The revelation follows a week of bad press about the community sports infrastructure grant program, sparked by a scathing auditor-general\u2019s report which found the program conducted under McKenzie, the former sports minister, skewed the grants towards marginal seats. Wyatt was the patron of three clubs that received funding: Kalamunda Districts Rugby Union Club ($180,000); Swan Districts Football Club ($199,616); and the Guildford &amp; Kalamunda Districts Swimming Club ($24,195). Video shows Wyatt handing over a giant $180,000 cheque for new women\u2019s changing rooms to the Kalamunda Districts Rugby Union Club on May 5, just two weeks before the federal election. The club is in his marginal electorate of Hasluck in Western Australia. The two grants to the Swan Districts Football Club \u2013 for $31,516 and $168,100 \u2013 paid for a new women\u2019s changeroom and to upgrade the sound system at its home ground. Wyatt has not only declared himself a patron of the club, but told parliament he was the club\u2019s \u201cno. 1 ticket holder\u201d. The club is located in the neighbouring electorate of Perth, also a marginal seat, which was retained by Labor\u2019s Patrick Gorman, who is also a supporter. Chief executive Jeff Dennis said he did not see any conflict of interest. \u201cWe firmly believe both grants were successful based on the merit of the application,\u201d Dennis told the Guardian. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any conflict of interest with either Ken Wyatt or Patrick Gorman. Both support the club because we deliver many broad and deep community outreach strategies.\u201d In January 2019 Wyatt posted photos to social media handing a large-sized $24,000 cheque to the Guildford &amp; Kalamunda Districts Swimming Club to purchase new pool covers. Henderson declared that for part of 2019 she was a member of the Barwon Heads Football and Netball Club and a sponsor of the Grovedale Tigers Football and Netball Club, both of which have now lapsed. Both are in Henderson\u2019s former marginal seat of Corangamite. According to Sports Australia Barwon Heads got $370,000 in the first round of the program for new lighting at its home ground and Grovedale got $256,000 in the third round. The Barwon Heads grant was awarded after prime minister Scott Morrison, Henderson, and the club\u2019s president Tim Goddard were pictured together in October 2018. The club made personal representations to Morrison and Henderson about the need for new lighting and other facility upgrades, according to its Facebook page. Henderson told Guardian Australia she had backed clubs and organisations \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d. \u201cOf the nine Corangamite clubs and one Corio club for which I was asked to, and provided, a letter of support, only two were successful: Barwon Heads Football and Netball Club in Corangamite ($370,000) and Geelong Soccer and Sports Club in Corio ($500,000),\u201d she said. \u201cLike many MPs, I sponsored many major sporting clubs across my electorate. \u201cOf five applicant clubs in Corangamite which I sponsored, two were successful and three were unsuccessful in obtaining funding.\u201d Liberal MP Julian Leeser disclosed that he is a patron of the Eastwood-Thornleigh District Tennis Association, which received $184,000 in the second round. Liberal MP Jason Falinski declared he is a patron of the Bayview Golf Club, which got $140,372 in the third round of the program. In July Frydenberg declared to parliament that he is an honorary member of the Grace Park Tennis Club, part of the Grace Park Hawthorn Club which received $25,000 in the third round of the program. Frydenberg also held his official function for the 2019 election night at the club. Frydenberg, Falinski and Leeser said their offices had sent general alerts to sports clubs in their electorates about the grant program but clubs applied independently. Frydenberg said \u201clocal sports clubs were notified of the program but no representations were made [on their behalf]\u201d. Falinski said he \u201cmade no personal representations for grants \u2013 I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever spoken to Bridget McKenzie [about the program]\u201d. \u201cThe first I knew about the [Bayview Golf Club] application is when I was told they had been successful.\u201d A spokeswoman for Leeser said in December 2018 McKenzie visited his electorate to discuss mobile phone reception and Leeser took her to see a number of sports clubs including the Eastwood-Thornleigh District Tennis Association and some others who had applied for a grant. The auditor general\u2019s report found that 70% of projects approved by McKenzie in the second round in March 2019 were not recommended by Sport Australia, rising to 73% in the third round in April 2019 after an extra $40m was tipped into the program. Morrison, McKenzie and Frydenberg have all defended the program, arguing all projects were eligible for grants and no rules were broken in the allocation of funding. Nevertheless, the attorney general is now reviewing legal issues that could render the grants invalid, including the auditor general\u2019s finding that McKenzie lacked authority to approve grants and the program may be unconstitutional. Morrison has suggested that after cabinet approved the program his office\u2019s role was limited to relaying on representations made by his MPs, with McKenzie making the final decision on grants. Guardian Australia contacted Wyatt for comment.",

Some cabinet ministers are understood to have expressed the view that there is a need for the government to step up action in a way that is both \u201cgenuine and believable\u201d in the year ahead. However, no one argued for any substantial policy change that strayed from the Coalition\u2019s election commitments.</p> \n<p><strong>The Senate trial in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment kicked off today, </strong>with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer announcing he would introduce a series of amendments to majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s impeachment trial resolution, in the hopes of collecting new evidence for Trump\u2019s trial.

Top stories Scott Morrison\u2019s senior ministers discussed repositioning the government\u2019s climate change policies in a cabinet meeting on Monday. After Morrison claimed there were no members of his frontbench wanting stronger action on climate change policy, sources have told Guardian Australia that ministers discussed the issue at length in the cabinet meeting that followed in Canberra that day. Some cabinet ministers are understood to have expressed the view that there is a need for the government to step up action in a way that is both \u201cgenuine and believable\u201d in the year ahead. However, no one argued for any substantial policy change that strayed from the Coalition\u2019s election commitments. The Senate trial in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment kicked off today, with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer announcing he would introduce a series of amendments to majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s impeachment trial resolution, in the hopes of collecting new evidence for Trump\u2019s trial. The House impeachment managers criticised the proposed trial rules outlined in McConnell\u2019s resolution as \u201ca White House-driven and rigged process, with a truncated schedule designed to go late into the night and further conceal the president\u2019s misconduct.\u201d Follow the latest developments live. Meanwhile, Trump is at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he used a keynote speech to tell the world\u2019s business leaders to stop listening to \u201cprophets of doom\u201d and to attack the teenage activist Greta Thunberg over her climate crisis warnings. Greyhound has warned workers they could be caught \u201cin the crossfire\u201d over a contract with Adani.

Australia NAB faces a class action lawsuit for delaying the move of $6.3bn belonging to more than 330,000 super customers to low-fee accounts \u2013 a decision that allowed the big four bank\u2019s financial advisers to continue to reap lucrative fees. Crown Resorts may have breached its casino licence over a proposed share deal with Melco, and raises questions about Crown\u2019s suitability as a casino operator, the counsel assisting a New South Wales inquiry into the casino giant, Adam Bell SC, has said. Police have been accused of acting in \u201csecret\u201d to obtain key documents in the case of a Sydney professor\u2019s alleged fake harassment campaign. Prof Dianne Jolley, the dean of science at the University of Technology Sydney, was arrested in November for allegedly sending fake threats to herself after the university planned to cancel a Chinese medicine course. The first case of China\u2019s new deadly coronavirus may have reached Australia, with health authorities in Queensland confirming that a man is being monitored for the condition.

Her decision, two weeks into the campaign, came as she failed to secure any union or affiliate backing, although she secured 23 nominations from MPs to put her into the latest phase of the contest. Brazilian federal prosecutors have indicted the American journalist Glenn Greenwald for cybercrimes, alleging he \u201chelped, encouraged and guided\u201d a group of hackers who obtained mobile phone messages between leading figures in Brazil\u2019s mammoth Car Wash anti-corruption investigation.

But the benefit from Thomas Cook\u2019s demise last September probably had the greatest impact on the 9% boost in average revenue per seat in last three months of 2019; ticket prices could be nudged up.</p> <p>One can\u2019t exactly call the event a piece of good fortune since rivals go out of business all the time in the short-haul European market, but Thomas Cook was a biggie. The stock market caught the message early, of course: easyJet\u2019s share price has improved by two-thirds since last autumn. Meanwhile, Brexit suddenly feels less terrifying, at least for this summer, and easyJet now has a carbon-offset policy to wave at its critics.</p> <p>It is why Stelios Haji-Ioannou\u2019s annual exercise of his speedy grumbling rights looks pointless this time. Even he sounded slightly apologetic.

      "bodyText": "You had to travel a long way down easyJet\u2019s bullish trading update to find the main reason for the \u201cpositive momentum\u201d in the business, but eventually it appeared. Thomas Cook went bust, which is very helpful if you\u2019re a competitor. Naturally, management preferred to sing about factors under its control, such as artful teasing of \u201cancillary revenues\u201d, meaning add-ons such as allocated seating. But the benefit from Thomas Cook\u2019s demise last September probably had the greatest impact on the 9% boost in average revenue per seat in last three months of 2019; ticket prices could be nudged up. One can\u2019t exactly call the event a piece of good fortune since rivals go out of business all the time in the short-haul European market, but Thomas Cook was a biggie. The stock market caught the message early, of course: easyJet\u2019s share price has improved by two-thirds since last autumn. Meanwhile, Brexit suddenly feels less terrifying, at least for this summer, and easyJet now has a carbon-offset policy to wave at its critics. It is why Stelios Haji-Ioannou\u2019s annual exercise of his speedy grumbling rights looks pointless this time. Even he sounded slightly apologetic. The founder and 34% shareholder (with his family) would like earnings to be higher because easyJet\u2019s fleet has increased by 46% since 2015, but he\u2019ll vote only a \u201ctoken\u201d few shares against the re-election of the chairman, John Barton, because he thinks he\u2019s doing a good job.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>South Korea</h2> \n<p>At Incheon airport near Seoul, the only airport in South Korea with direct flights from Wuhan, authorities have been operating two special gates for passengers from the city since 3 January where officials use ear thermometers to check passengers\u2019 temperatures.

Here\u2019s our news story about the big news of the day - the clash between Trump and Thunberg. Goodnight! Late news: we\u2019ve heard that France and the US could agree a ceasefire in their dispute over how tech giants are taxed. Huawei\u2019s founder was in combative mood today: More than 20 top bosses are dining with Donald Trump tonight, including the bosses of Saudi Aramco, Sony, Softbank, BP and Barclays. Here\u2019s the full list, via the White House pool. Dr. Patrice Motsepe, Founder &amp; Executive Chairman, African Rainbow Minerals, South Africa Hiroshi Mikitani, Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer, Rakuten Inc., Japan Dr. Joerg Reinhardt, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Novartis AG, Switzerland Sergio P.

He is competitive... He wants to win.\u201d I\u2019m tempted to book Infantino for excessive creeping. US President Donald Trump has held a series of meetings with world leaders today, having installed his team in a prime suite in WEF\u2019s congress centre. That includes Swiss Confederation President Simonetta Sommaruga (who criticised the move towards divisive populism during her speech to WEF today). Sommaruga and Trump apparently discussed \u201cbilateral issues and reiterated their interest in boosting trade ties\u201d. ... and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Donald Trump is now enjoying a dinner with top CEOs in Davos, including FIFA President Gianni Infantino, we see.... Harvard economist Ken Rogoff has pulled Kudlow up short, over his claims that countries should just cut tax rates, deregulate, and let the economy run along. Oof! Larry Kudlow agrees that the Federal Reserve is quietly conducting a new quantitative easing scheme, even if it denies it. Donald Trump\u2019s economics expert says that the Fed\u2019s recent policy of buying $60bn of short-term Treasury bills is effectively a stimulus programme The Fed claims it\u2019s simply providing liquidity to keep the plumping of the financial system flowing. But Kudlow isn\u2019t convinced, pointing out that the markets aren\u2019t either! The net effect is that they are expanding the balance sheet, whatever you want to call it. It\u2019s no wonder the stock market and the housing market is rising. Larry Kudlow then hints that the Federal Reserve could consider cutting borrowing costs.... Speaking delicately, he says the Fed has done a good job in 2019, reversing its rate rises in 2018. I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing them be a little bolder. Our short-term rates in and around the Fed Funds market could be a little lower. I wouldn\u2019t want to criticise them, though, Kudlow adds (not that this has ever stopped his boss!). In case anyone missed his message the first time, Kudlow reiterates that: These negative rates are just not helping banks recover. Now that the excitement of Trump vs Thunberg has died down, we can focus on other matters. A heavyweight panel is gathering now, to discuss the threat of a liquidity trap. Gita Gopinath, Chief Economist at the International Monetary Fund, explains that a liquidity trap occurs when there is a massive appetite for liquid assets. That means people will still buy them at very high prices (as we currently see for eurozone sovereign debt, for example). This makes monetary policy ineffective, as interest rates no longer work as a tool. That would be a problem in the next downturn, Gopinath explains, as central banks wouldn\u2019t be able to stimulate growth. This is a timely issue, as interest rates in many countries are at or near record lows! Larry Kudlow, Donald Trump\u2019s chief economic advisor, weighs in -- he says negative interest rates are a bad idea. Negative rates are not a good idea. They\u2019re really bad for banks, they\u2019re really bad for savers, they\u2019re not good for investors. Q: But Donald Trump is envious that other countries get them and the US doesn\u2019t... He\u2019s keener than I am, Kudlow jokes, saying that Trump\u2019s background as a real estate developer means he loves the idea of low rates. Kudlow also warns that monetary stimulus can\u2019t work alone -- countries need to implement lower marginal tax rates to stimulate demand. European countries, and Japan could do \u201ca heck of a lot more\u201d to boost growth, by lowering tax rates, Kudlow insists - suggesting that Trump\u2019s tax-cutting plan has paid off (although growth has actually been below the long-term average of late) I mentioned earlier that Donald Trump\u2019s claim about creating 12,000 factories during his presidency was true... ...well, Rahaf Harfoush, a digital anthropologist here at WEF, tells me that many of these factories would be largely automated - so not creating many new jobs for Americans...... Our Davos heroes of the day are Joe Stiglitz and his partner Anya Schiffrin for drawing up his list of facts about the US economy under Trump....and handing them out liberally today: John Ferguson, Director of country analysis at The Economist Intelligence Unit, has criticised Donald Trump\u2019s attack on climate \u2018prophets of doom\u2019: \u201cMr Trump is clearly wrong on this one. We only have to look at Australia to see the devastating impacts of climate change. The science has been telling us for years that these sort of events will become both more frequent and more severe. The longer people like Mr Trump delay, the more costly and dangerous climate change will be.\u201d Moving on to another important topic, antimicrobial resistance... A biennial report from the Access to Medicine Foundation, an Amsterdam-based non-profit group, has found that many antibiotics are unavailable in poorer countries despite higher infection rates, exacerbating the threat of drug-resistant superbugs. Common infections have become increasingly harder to treat globally. The study, which assesses 30 of the biggest drugmakers on their efforts to address drug-resistant infections, also shows that the number of new treatments being developed for common infectious diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, gonorrhoea and urinary tract infections has fallen \u2013\u2013 to 138 from 175 projects two years ago. The report will be presented at Davos on Thursday. The roundtable discussion will be opened by Bruno Bruins, the Dutch minister for medical care, and moderated by Professor Dame Sally Davies, UK special envoy on antimicrobial resistance and co-convener of the UN interagency coordination group on AMR. Speakers include GSK Vaccines\u2019 chief medical officer Thomas Bruer and Charlotte Petri Gronitzka, UN assistant secretary general and the deputy executive director of partnerships at Unicef. Here is our full story on the study.JK Donald Trump\u2019s claim to the Davos throng that America was enjoying an unprecedented boom might sound good, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t ring totally true. Economist Ian Shepherdson points out that growth has been below long-term averages of late: Trump could argue that he was citing the duration of the recovery -- the longest ever. But that would mean taking credit for president Obama\u2019s work too... My colleague Larry Elliott also caught up with Nobel prize-winning economist Joe Stiglitz, who said: \u201cResearch shows that Trump normally tells five or six lies a day. He far exceeded that today.\u201d Stiglitz, who had drawn up a list of economic facts for checking purposes, also noted that growth had been faster under Obama and that life expectancy had fallen every year of Trump\u2019s presidency. Trump and Thunberg are battling for the headlines from Davos today.... and the Swedish teenager has the upper hand on the New York Times, we see: It\u2019s been an exciting first day at Davos, where about 3,000 political and business leaders, academics, activists, celebrities and journalists have gathered for the annual World Economic Forum. Appearing on a panel with other young campaigners, Greta Thunberg spoke about the 18 months since she started her climate strike outside the Swedish parliament. She told world leaders to listen to the science, and later said the world is on fire. She urged leaders to act for their children\u2019s sake. In particular, she called for an immediate end to fossil fuel investment and extraction and fossil fuel subsidies, and a general exit from fossil fuels. US president Donald Trump then spoke in the main conference hall (preceded by a traditional Swiss song performed by a group of tenors in national costume) and got some applause from the audience for his pledge to sign the US up to the 1tn tree planting initiative. The eye-catching pledge aside, he used his keynote speech to boast of his (supposed) achievements and declared the US was in \u201cin the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before\u201d. Thunberg responded: \u201cPlanting trees is good, of course, but it\u2019s nowhere near enough.\u201d (she spoke at another panel discussion). Greenpeace was also unimpressed with Trump\u2019s pledge. JK Donald Trump may have pledged to plant more trees, but he\u2019s not been converted to the realities of the climate emergency. During his speech, he took a real swipe at the \u201cperennial prophets of doom\u201d who he claims are too gloomy. Here\u2019s the full section, which shows that the US president has not accepted the message from Greta Thunberg to act now. \u201cThis is not a time for pessimism. This is a time for optimism. To embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse. They are the heirs of yesterday\u2019s foolish fortune tellers. They want to see us do badly, but we don\u2019t let that happen. They predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s, mass starvation in the 70s, and an end of oil in the 1990s. These alarmists always demand the same thing: absolute power to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives. We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy, wreck our country or eradicate our liberty.\u201d In a session on the US economy, Trump\u2019s treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin has been challenged over the president\u2019s claim that America is enjoying a boom like no other. Mnuchin is careful neither to repeat Trump\u2019s dubious boast nor to embarrass his boss.\u201dyou have to look at this on a relative basis not an absolute basis\u201d he says, noting that the US has been growing faster while the rest of the world is slowing down. The US has been affected by the global slowdown, the sharp drop in production of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max and a strike at general motors. Mnuchin says that the US trade war with China has not been a factor in slowing the global economy. Intriguingly, he says that the new US-China phase 1 trade accord will boost global growth. Han now turns to the climate emergency. He says the one trillion trees initiative launched at Davos this week is an important step. But he doesn\u2019t seem to be joining it, as Donald Trump did today. Instead, Han says China has already made progress in reforesting, and is \u201cready to share our experience with other countries\u201d. That must be disappointing for the 1t.org movement - who would like as many countries on board as possible. Han ends by repeating his pledge that China is committed to working with other countries to build a better global economy. Vice-president Han then promises that China will open its doors still wider to the word. He doesn\u2019t explicitly name the US, but we know who this passage of his speech is aimed at: Despite the protectionist and unilateral moves by some countries, we will not stop opening up and we will not move in the opposite direction. We are open to buy more high-quality goods from other countries, to encourage balanced trade, he continues. On trade, Han pledges that China will lower tariffs, cut non-tariffs barriers, and create new free trade zones to spur growth. The phase one trade deal between US and China is good for both countries, and for the world Back in the Davos congress hall, the second major speech of the day is underway -- from China\u2019s vice-premier, Han Zheng. He\u2019s a senior figure in Chinese politics - one of Xi Jinping\u2019s deputies. Klaus Schwab is introducing Han, talking about the progress China made since \u201copening up\u201d 40 years ago. China has gone from 1.8% of global GDP to 16% since it joined WEF, Schwab says, which helped to lift people out of poverty. Han then takes the podium, and launches a defence of globalisation. The world economy undergoing a profound adjustment, he says. Globalisation is facing growing attacks, protectionism is spreading, and the risks and uncertainties in global economy are notably on the rise. And he hits out at protectionism (slightly ironic, given China\u2019s track record of protecting its own companies). Here are the key points: Economic globalisation is a trend of history...and a natural result of advances in science and technology. In a world that is so deeply integrated, no country can cope entirely on its own. Rather than blaming globalisation for economic problems, we must develop an \u201cinclusive and open world economy together\u201d. He declares: We should all make the pie of the global economy bigger, and create mechanisms to share the rewards of globalisation better. This way people in all countries can share from the benefits of globalisation and global growth. Political scientist Ian Bremmer detects signs that Davos is preparing for another four years of Trump: If so, that bodes badly for the climate emergency, given he took the US off the Paris Agreement. Dr Frederik Dahlmann, Associate Professor of Sustainability at Warwick Business School, says Greta Thunberg is right to blast Davos for the lack of progress in the last year. He says WEF is an annual ritual of well-meaning talks and speeches, from which little progress flows: \u201cWhile the topics increasingly cover the broader challenges leaders from business and politics face, we have yet to see sufficient efforts to turn these discussions into real-world action. \u201cAssessments of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, which include climate change, poverty, decline in biodiversity, social inequalities, peace and justice, suggest that progress is generally slow and uneven. Our world requires strong collection action from actors across business, politics and civil society to achieve the wider ambitions of the Agenda 2030. Chris Giles of the FT was not impressed by Trump\u2019s speech, and its lack of economic rigour: Former UN climate warrier Christiana Figueres has also urged Davos attendees to think about younger generations, and take the necessary action on climate. Figueres, who was the UN\u2019s Executive Secretary on Climate Change, told leaders: \u201cWe devote our life not to climate change. We devote our life to the quality of life our children and grandchildren will have.\u201d Greta Thunberg then outlines three demands to her audience at Davos: Companies, banks, institutions and governments should halt all investment in fossil fuel investment and extraction. immediately end all fossil fuel subsidies and immediately exit from fossil fuels We don\u2019t want it done in 2050, 2030, or even 2021, we want it done now, Thunberg continues. You might think we\u2019re naive, but if you won\u2019t do it, you must explain to your children why you\u2019ve given up on the Paris Agreement goals, and knowingly created a climate crisis, she says. And she completes her speech with an appeal to the global elite\u2019s hearts, as well as minds: Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour. And we\u2019re asking you to act as if you love your children more than anything else. Thunberg now warns that the world is still on fire, due to lack of progress from world leaders. \u201cThis is not not about right and left. We couldn\u2019t care less about your party politics,\u201d Thunberg continues (she\u2019s being heard in absolute silence), From a sustainability perspective, the right, the left, and the centre have all failed. No political ideology or economic structure has managed to tackle the climate and environmental emergency and create a cohesive and sustainable world. Because that world, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, is currently on fire. Elsewhere in Davos, Greta Thunberg is speaking about the climate emergency again - to another packed room. She begins with a pointed reminder that little has happened since she wowed WEF in 2019. One year ago, I came to Davos and told you that our house is on fire. I said I wanted you to panic. I\u2019d been warned that telling people to panic about the climate crisis is a very dangerous thing to do. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s fine. Trust me, I\u2019ve done this before, and I can assure you that it doesn\u2019t lead to anything. And for the record, when children tell you to panic, we\u2019re not telling you to go on like before. Thunberg adds that: We\u2019re not telling you to rely on technologies that don\u2019t exist at scale yet, and perhaps never will. We\u2019re not asking you to cheat and fiddle numbers, or offset your emissions by just paying someone to plant trees in Africa while the Amazon is chopped down, Thunburg continues. And she also puts Trump\u2019s one trillion trees pledge in its place: Planting trees is good, of course, but it\u2019s nowhere near enough, and it cannot replace real mitigation and rewilding nature. We don\u2019t need to lower emissions....Emissions need to stop. Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace\u2019s executive director, isn\u2019t wowed by Trump\u2019s performance, though. The one trillion trees initiative doesn\u2019t make up for the lack of a wider attack on the climate emergency, she tells us. Morgan says Trump still doesn\u2019t appear to understand the crisis: To assume that you can have a great, profitable America, and happy Americans without understanding the risk to Americans from climate change is astounding. It just demonstrates the level of denial, and the capture of this government by the coal, oil and gas industries. So what should Trump, or his successor, be doing? \u201cHe should be putting in place a comprehensive, socially just, climate plan that would drive emissions down to zero by 2040, and would leave fossil fuels in the ground.\u201d Rich Buckley, AstraZeneca\u2019s global corporate affairs chief, is also pleased to hear Trump back the trillion-trees pledge today. He tells us: The applause [for Trump\u2019s pledge]...demonstrates that it is a message that appeals to a global audience. An optimistic, action-oriented approach is one that is well received. Trump\u2019s pledge to join the one trillion trees initiative is probably the best news out of his speech. This is an effort to plant 1 trillion trees across the globe; boosting reforestation would suck up carbon dioxide, and combat raising global temperatures. We just caught up with Marc Benioff, head of Salesforce, who says he\u2019s excited by Trump\u2019s move. I\u2019m very excited by the trillion trees, and that the US is joining 1t.org. It\u2019s very important for the future that we sequester 200 gigatons as fast as possible. Hopefully we\u2019ll hear the same thing from the Chinese later today, Benioff adds (vice-premier Han Zheng is addressing Davos). Wow. That\u2019s quite a pledge from Trump. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how Greta Thunberg responds. There is some scepticism on Twitter whether the US president will honour this promise, though. Earlier, Marc Benioff, the American internet entrepreneur (and a billionaire), tweeted that his cloud computing company Salesforce would plant 100m trees. Does he have a message for Greta Thunberg? Trump reiterates that he is a \u201cbig believer in the environment\u201d and that the US will join in a global initiative to plant a trillion trees. (A Swiss study published in the journal Science last year suggested fighting global heating by planting a trillion trees.) He adds: What I want is the cleanest water and the cleanest air. Outside the conference hall, Trump speaks to reporters. He reckons his speech was \u201cwell received\u201d and notes that \u201c200 of the biggest companies in the world were in the room\u201d \u2013 many of which will be investing in the US, he claims. That means jobs, that means economic development. We are doing well and we are going to do a lot better. The US president has finished his speech. I\u2019m not sure anyone\u2019s expected Notre Dame to feature, but Trump is now hailing the inspiringly reaction to its recent fire. With an eye on November\u2019s election, Trump is now attacking \u201cradical socialism\u201d... In a thinly-veiled dig at Greta Thunberg and other climate protesters, Trump says We must reject the perennial prophets of doom. This is not a time for pessimism. This is a time for optimism. But make no mistake, before he entered the conference hall the US president claimed he cared deeply about the environment. I\u2019m a big believer in the environment. The environment to me is very important. Importantly, the US president then signs the US up to the 1 trillion tree initiative -- to plant about a trillion trees around the world. On Brexit, Trump says he hopes to agree a tremendous trade deal with the UK, adding that PM Boris Johnson also wants to do this. The US president has praise for the UK\u2019s leader Boris Johnson, calling him \u201ca wonderful new prime minister\u201d who \u201cwants very much to make a deal\u201d on trade [following Brexit]. Trump has a pop at the Obama administration, talking about the \u201cwreckage\u201d that he inherited. On to trade... Trump says negotiations with China on a Phase Two trade deal will start shortly. Last week, the world\u2019s two biggest economies finally signed the long-awaited Phase One agreement. Our relationship with China has right now probably never been better. We went through a rough patch... ... but now we love each other, he says, referring to China\u2019s leader. Julia Kollewe taking over Trump continues to trumpet his achievements, now turning to families with children, saying his administration had doubled child tax credit for 40m American families. He then adds America has some of the lowest taxes in the world. Tremendous wealth is pouring into areas that for 100 years saw nothing. There is no better place on earth than the United States. No Trump speech is complete without a pop at the US central bank. The president says that the economic boom has happened \u201cdespite\u201d the US Federal Reserve, which \u201craised rates too fast and cut them too slowly\u201d. The time for scepticism is over. People are flowing back, he says, thanking business leaders who have moved factories into the US. I hold up the American model as an example to the world, Trump declares. Pro worker, pro citizen, and pro family. America is enjoying a blue-collar boom, Trump insists, citing wage data showing that those at the bottom are seeing stronger wage growth. He tells his audience of global elite: The American dream is back, bigger and better than before 60,000 factories we\u2019re lost under the last administration, and we\u2019ve gained 12,000 on my watch, Trump adds (a claim that was rated as broadly true recently). We\u2019ve gained 7 million jobs since I took over, Trump continues -- saying he had this target in his head when he took over but didn\u2019t mention it (hmmm). The president cites the good progress on unemployment, for minority groups and women. And he then claims to be tackling inequality and spreading wealth. That\u2019s questionable, given the world\u2019s top billionaires (many Americans) became 25% richer last year. Trump takes the podium, saying it\u2019s an honour to be at WEF. And he\u2019s straight into banging the drum about how well America is doing. I\u2019m proud to say that the US is in an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen before, says Trump. America is thriving, flourishing, and winning like never before, he continues, citing the trade deals signed last week with China, and Mexico-Canada. Those deals are a model for the 21st century, he claims He claims the US was flagging when he took over, and that pessimism had taken root among business leaders and other influential figures. But under his watch, things are improving..... Here comes Donald Trump! Klaus Schwab is welcoming the US president back to the stage, for the second time (after 2018). It is an honour to host you, Mr President, says Schwab -- who has never knowingly under-flattered a world leader. Over the last three years, the US economy has enjoyed growth and dynamism, Schwab continues, citing stock market growth, and the very low unemployment rate in the US Words alone cannot capture the scene.... In a classic \u2018only at Davos\u2019 moment, a group of Swiss musicians have appeared on stage in full national costume. They\u2019re singing a much-loved Swiss anthem, rather movingly (anything to break the boredom in and outside the hall). Outside the Congress Hall, a large crowd are gathered near to a white double door where president Trump should soon appear. Our live feed isn\u2019t broken, don\u2019t worry. It simply lacks a president.... The WEF are now showing a video about the loss of biodiversity, and how use of pesticides mean bees are dying out. Simonetta Sommaruga, president of the Swiss Confederation, is calling for action, saying it is a mistake to place economic interests above the functioning of the natural world. Biodiversity is like the Eiffel Tower, she says. Take away one screw a day, and nothing happens at first. But then you take away one too many....and everything collapses. Sommaruga also launches a stirring attack on populism, saying she looks at the state of the world with concern. Passions are being stirred to achieve political goals, through the use of intolerance, hatred and revenge, she says. Over to you, president Trump..... Klaus Schwabb, founder of the World Economic Forum (50 years ago!) is on the stage now. He tells the audience of \u201cglobal stake holders\u201d that there is a \u201cgeneral loss of trust and confidence among people, along with profound pessimism and cynicism\u201d. But each of us can help create a better world, Schwabb insists, whether you\u2019re a politician, business leader, the head of an NGO, an activist, a cultural leader or a young person. That\u2019s certainly what four young people -- Greta Thunberg, Natasha Mwansa, Salvador G\u00f3mez-Col\u00f3n and Autumn Peltier -- demanded this morning. Schwabb is now giving a gushing welcome to the Swiss president for all the help keeping Davos going all these years. Trump must be along soon.... While we wait for Donald Trump, here\u2019s our news story on Greta Thunberg\u2019s call for climate action. Cambridge classics professor Mary Beard adds that she\u2019s hoping to encourage the global elite to think about history during her time at Davos: History isn\u2019t going to solve the world\u2019s problems, but it can help you think about the world\u2019s problems in a more complicated and subtle way. She also suggests we shouldn\u2019t dismiss Davos as simply a place for partying. Some good can come out of it too, she tells me (before heading towards the Trump speech). Every time you hear it on the news, it\u2019s \u2018Mr So-and-So is at the schmooze-fest at Davos\u2019. Maybe it is..but there\u2019s worst things to do than schmoozing, if actually what you\u2019re doing is talking and thinking hard at the same time. I just ran into top academic Mary Beard in the Davos scrum. She\u2019s no fan of Trump, of course, but argues that it\u2019s better for people on different sides to be talking. It\u2019s her first Davos; not as monocultural and blokish as she expected, apparently As in 2018, Trump is hogging all the limelight at Davos - and he\u2019s not even here yet! But he must be close... The Davos congress hall is filling up with delegates waiting to listen to Trump. Many of the rest are hanging around outside for a glimpse of the president\u2019s arrival... No sign of Trump yet, but there\u2019s a growing buzz in the Congress Centre ahead of his arrival. People have bene queuing to get into the congress hall for an hour Heads-up. US President Donald Trump has arrived in Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum. Air Force One landed at Zurich Airport shortly after dawn this morning. The passengers then transferred to a flock of helicopters for the 45 minute journey up the mountains to Davos (the train would be more environmentally friendly...). According to the White House press pool, Trump boarded Marine One, which lifted off at 8:51 am Davos time (7.51am GMT). Salvador G\u00f3mez-Col\u00f3n, who organized Light and Hope for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, chides the media for paying too much attention to inconsequential stories, rather than issues that really matter. Finally, fellow teenage activist Autumn Peltier (who has been campaigning for cleaner water since she was 8) wraps up the session with some sage advice: If you have an idea, or a solution, or a way you can help us, just do it. And that\u2019s a wrap. Four young activists have got this year\u2019s WEF underway, with a display of passion and determination that the rest of Davos will struggle to match. Q: So how do you all deal with the haters? Autumn Peltier says she and her mother get a lot of negative comments -- and they ignore it. Greta Thunberg sweeps the question aside, and produces a statement she\u2019d like to read instead. She cites the IPCC report on climate change from 2018, which explained how few years are left to act if there\u2019s a 67% chance of keeping the global temperature rise to below 1.5%. With today\u2019s emissions levels, the remaining budget is gone in less than eight years. These aren\u2019t anyone\u2019s views, this is the science. Thunberg adds that such forecasts doesn\u2019t include feedback loops and tipping points, and also often assume that \u201cfuture generations will somehow suck hundreds of billions of tonnes of CO2 out of the atmosphere, even though such technology doesn\u2019t exist yet.\u201d She tells Davos: I\u2019ve been repeating these numbers at nearly every speech I\u2019ve given for the last 18 months. I know you don\u2019t want to report about these numbers, but I\u2019ll keep saying them until you do, Thunberg concludes. Q: What can the media do better to help young activists? Natasha Mwanga says the media has the power to put us at the centre of the conversation. But they only focus on stories for a couple of days, then get bored and drop them. She points out that the media has huge power, as the \u2018fourth estate\u2019. Journalists should use that power to \u201cbring us hope\u201d. Autumn Peltier makes another good point -- on the damaging impact of negative comments online. If you want to say something bad about us, just don\u2019t. Q: Do activists feel they are being heard enough? Greta gives the audience the giggles, by pointing out that she doesn\u2019t have a problem here. I can\u2019t complain about being heard, I\u2019m being heard all the time. But science isn\u2019t at the centre of the conversation, and it needs to be. Q: So what needs to happen to tackle environmental and social issues that you all care about? Canadian water activist Autumn Peltier says that we need more people, children and adults, to make their voices heard. Speaking at the World Economic Forum today will help, she says, as it\u2019s a global stage for young activists. But she also warns not to simply hand activists awards, instead of listening to them. I don\u2019t want your awards... Award me by making the changes I want to see, Peltier adds. Salvador G\u00f3mez-Col\u00f3n has a neat idea -- young activists could \u201cmentor leaders\u201d, and give them the knowledge and skills they need. Natasha Mwansa adds that young activists could consider more practical action, rather than limiting their work to posting on social media. Natasha Wang Mwansa, the 18-year old women\u2019s and girls\u2019 activist from Zambia, has issued a loud warning to the global elite that young activists are determined to change the world. We are able to step out and say \u2018this is what we want\u2019, explains Mwansa. \u201cWe haven\u2019t let our age stop us.\u201d And she wins whooping and clapping from the packed-out audience by declaring: The older generation has experience, but we have ideas and energy. Speaking passionately and engagingly, Mwansa says that we should put young activists in the same room as the UN secretary-general - so they can use work together and his power for good. Salvador G\u00f3mez-Col\u00f3n weights in here too, saying that young activists are tired of being given promises that aren\u2019t delivered. Salvador G\u00f3mez-Col\u00f3n, the 16-year old activist from San Juan, Puerto Rico, speaks next. He says world leaders need to stop treating climate change as a political issue, a social-economic issue or a racial issue. The climate crisis just is. And until we address that, we\u2019re not getting anywhere. G\u00f3mez-Col\u00f3n then warns his audience that the young activists are not going to wait five, 10 or 20 years to execute change.. We\u2019re not the future, we\u2019re the present. And we\u2019re acting now. Clean water advocate Autumn Peltier, speaks next. Peltier, a member of the Wikwemikong First Nation, says she has seen a lot more youths standing up for issues that matter, since she challenged Canadian PM Justin Trudeau at the age of 12 We have the courage to raise our voices, she says. The panel begins with a short film about the new wave of young climate activists around the globe -- it\u2019s pretty inspiring, and gets a round of applause from the assembled audience. Greta Thunberg then speaks about the remarkable 18 months since she started her climate strike. Lots has happened that no-one could have predicted, and this has started a movement, she tells WEF. It\u2019s not just me, she add modestly, it is lots of young people around the world who have created an \u2018alliance of movements\u2019. People are more aware now. It feels like the climate and environment is a hot topic now, thanks to young people pushing. But at the same time, nothing has been achieved, because global emissions are still going up, Thunberg points out. So what needs to happen? We need to start listening to the science, and treat this crisis with the importance it deserve, she insists, adding: Without treating this as a real crisis we cannot solve it. Greta\u2019s panel is the youngest ever convened at the World Economic Forum, if you exclude moderator Edward Felsenthal of Time Magazine (Felsenthal jokes). WEF\u2019s panel session on creating a sustainable path towards a better world is starting now. The room is packed. Greta Thunberg is joined by: Salvador G\u00f3mez-Col\u00f3n, who raised funds and awareness after Hurricane Mar\u00eda devastated his native Puerto Rico in 2017. Natasha Mwansa, a campaigner for women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights from Zambi Autumn Peltier, Chief Water Commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation of indigenous people in Canada. As usual, there\u2019s bumper-to-bumper traffic on the streets of Davos, as the global elite are shuttled around in luxury limos or in \u2018green\u2019 shuttle-buses. There\u2019s also a strong security presence -- I saw about a dozen soldiers, some armed, as I scuttled along the icy pavements to the Congress Centre. There\u2019s the usual high security on the entrances to WEF too (airport-style scanners, no liquids allowed). Davos\u2019s main street, the Promenade, has been invaded by corporations - they\u2019ve paid massive sums to turn tourist shops or cafes into their base for the week. Greta is in the building....ready for her first panel session in 15 minutes time or so. Good morning from Davos, where the 50th World Economic Forum is getting underway. Around 3,000 heads of state, business chiefs, academics, activists, celebrities and journalists have descended for their annual splurge of meetings, speeches, parties, top-level discussions and general pontificating. And today could be dominated by two extremely different individuals, who are both changing the world in their own way. In one corner, US president Donald Trump. He\u2019ll give the first keynote speech this morning - a chance to tub-thump his America First agenda, trumpet his (limited) trade deal with China, and hail the ongoing US economic expansion. The Americans are in town in force. Trump has brought a large delegation, including Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin and White House advisor Larry Kudlow. But across the congress centre, climate activist Greta Thunberg will also be in the spotlight. She\u2019s demanding that governments and corporations wake up to the climate emergency, and take decisive action before our futures are ruined. As Thunberg and allies wrote in the Guardian last week: We demand that at this year\u2019s forum, participants from all companies, banks, institutions and governments immediately halt all investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction, immediately end all fossil fuel subsidies and immediately and completely divest from fossil fuels. We don\u2019t want these things done by 2050, 2030 or even 2021, we want this done now \u2013 as in right now. The climate emergency is a massive issue at Davos this week. WEF\u2019s own Risks Report shows that it\u2019s the biggest long-term risk facing the world economy. But there\u2019s lots of other issues on the agenda too, including the state of the world economy, the technology arms race, and mental health.

In 2018, James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, announced a one-off \u00a330m funding pot for immediate support for councils to tackle rough sleeping.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How does the law treat rough sleepers?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Rough sleeping and begging are illegal in ENgland and Wales under the Vagrancy Act 1824, which makes \u2018wandering abroad and lodging in any barn or outhouse, or in any deserted or unoccupied building, or in the open air, or under a tent, or in any cart or wagon, and not giving a good account of himself or herself\u2019 liable to a \u00a31,000 fine.

      "bodyText": "Short-term lettings through Airbnb and other online platforms are \u201cgrowing out of control\u201d in London with up to one in 50 of all homes now estimated to be available, town hall bosses have claimed. The spread of short term lets is encouraging antisocial behaviour and criminality with residents increasingly complaining about them being used as party houses and for prostitution and drug dealing, councils in the capital said. They believe it is pushing up rents and reducing the availability of homes for the rising number of households who are temporarily homeless, which in England hit 56,280 last year \u2013 the highest level since 2010. Westminster city council said recent problems include a property in Knightsbridge being used as a brothel, a mansion block near Hyde Park where more than a 100 of the 530 flats are thought to be in use as short-term rentals and a mews house in Marylebone rented on Airbnb for five people where police had to shut down a party for 50. \u201cAt a time when almost one in 50 Londoners is homeless, it\u2019s ridiculous that potentially one in 50 London homes is rented out as a short-term let,\u201d said Darren Rodwell, the leader of Barking and Dagenham council and the London Council\u2019s lead on housing. \u201cThe market is growing out of control. Boroughs are hearing more and more complaints about short term lets linked to anti-social behaviour and even criminality.\u201d Airbnb disputes the figures, which it said are flawed and based on \u201cinflated data\u201d caused by counting the same properties multiple times. It also said the snapshot was taken in December, a peak period for bookings. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe are good partners to London and nearly half of local entire home listings on Airbnb are rented less than just 30 nights a year.\u201d However the London Borough of Camden, a short-term-let hotspot, said more than 7,000 properties were used as in this way last year, with 48% exceeding the 90-night limit. London Councils, a cross-party organisation, is now demanding stronger regulation and it wants government action to provide mandatory registration of short-term lets and powers to punish irresponsible property owners. Earlier this month the Scottish government announced new powers for councils north of the border to license short-term landlords with powers to insist planning permission is sought before a whole property is switched to short-term lets. Campaigners in the historic centre of Edinburgh have complained the area has been overrun by properties turned over to short-term lettings. London Councils analysed the listings on six short-term lettings websites, Airbnb, Booking.com, Homeaway, Housetrip, Niumba and Trip Advisor, to produce the first snapshot of the proportion of the total housing stock now available on a nightly basis. They found over 108,000 listings and of these more than 73,000 were listed as entire homes rather than single rooms, like a traditional bed and breakfast. Planning permission is required to rent out homes on short lets for more than 90 nights in a year, but councils say this is almost impossible to police and there have been very few prosecutions. Karen Buck, MP for Westminster North, is campaigning for a public register of hosts which she argues will \u201cnudge\u201d landlords into a greater sense of responsibility. Airbnb has also backed the plan. \u201cWe have seen parties where firearms have been discharged, but the dominant issue is the toll on residential properties and the fact that neighbourhoods become extensions of the hospitality industry without the husbandry you get in a hotel,\u201d she said. \u201cThe benefits fall on the owner but all the costs fall on the neighbours or the council.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 22 January 2020.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England will examine how Britain could adopt a bitcoin-style digital currency as part of a global group of central banks that have joined together to examine the possible pitfalls of relying on electronic money. Bank officials will meet with the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Sveriges Riksbank, the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to pool research and experiences of the potential for a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The BoE deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe will co-chair the group with Benoi\u0302t C\u0153ure\u0301, a former ECB board member and head of the BIS innovation hub. The move comes amid the emergence of private sector digital currencies, such as bitcoin and Facebook\u2019s libra, which is due to be launched this year. Facebook\u2019s plans for its libra coin and a digital wallet have caught the attention of regulators and central banks worldwide, with Threadneedle Street being among those vowing tough new rules. The BoE was among several central banks to warn that libra would need to be regulated, leading many supporters to end their relationship with the digital currency. The idea of a central bank digital currency has been increasingly mooted worldwide to help improve payment systems and cross-border transactions. The Bank said the new working group would look at \u201cCBDC use cases; economic, functional and technical design choices, including cross-border interoperability; and the sharing of knowledge on emerging technologies\u201d. It will also work closely with other global forums and groups, such as the Financial Stability Board and the committee on payments and market infrastructures (CPMI), which is also chaired by Cunliffe. Just last month, Sweden\u2019s central bank said it would sign a deal with the consultancy firm Accenture to create a pilot platform for a digital currency, known as the e-krona. The Riksbank has been exploring the idea of its own digital currency for some time, especially given the rapid decline in the use of cash in Sweden. The European Central Bank has also been investigating the possible benefits of CBDC since last year. Fran Boait, executive director of Positive Money, said policymakers had been slow to realise how much enthusiasm there was for digital money. \u201cThey have been asleep at the wheel over the future of our money system being determined by a small number of banks, payment companies and now tech giants. \u201cThe rapid decline of cash and threat of private digital currencies like Facebook\u2019s libra have served as a much-needed wake-up call, but central bankers have a lot of catching up to do. \u201cCentral banks need to accelerate plans for a central bank digital currency, which would both ensure that people have the choice of a safe public banking option and prevent our monetary system being completely surrendered to unaccountable private interests.

But it remains to be seen what would be the exact scope of its powers, as well as whether it could direct the president to execute certain policies or if it would remain as more of an advisory body. The amendments did less to limit the powers of the presidency than was initially expected after Putin\u2019s speech, appearing to leave the presidency with key powers to direct security and foreign policy. A public vote on the amendments has been scheduled for April, and the Kremlin has said it will not be a formal referendum.",

Kirsty Williams, the Welsh education minister, confirmed the plans \u2013 part of the government\u2019s overhaul of relationships and sexuality education (RSE) and religious education \u2013 but said they would require \u201ccareful and sensitive\u201d implementation after the government\u2019s public consultation revealed strong feelings. Williams said the decision \u201censures that all pupils will learn about issues such as online safety and healthy relationships\u201d in state schools, and pledged to take into account the views expressed in the consultation. \u201cI recognise this is a sensitive matter and the consultation responses reflected strong and deeply-held concerns.

A number of religious and church groups reported concerns to the government\u2019s consultation, which suggested renaming the religious education lessons as \u201creligion, values and ethics\u201d and widening the curriculum to include different religions and humanism. Most Christian groups \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d the ending of the parental right to withdraw their children from RSE classes, according to the consultation summary, with some warning that it could lead to parents deciding to home-school in response. \u201cThere were concerns that the values of the state would dominate and could change with the political mood, leaving parents with no ability to prevent their child from being \u2018indoctrinated\u2019 in ways they do not approve,\u201d the consultation reported. There are more than 200 Christian faith schools in Wales, but headteachers across the country were broadly supportive, according to the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru, which described the subjects as \u201ctoo important for young people to miss\u201d. The new relationships and sexuality education curriculum would be drawn up over the next two years, Williams said. It would encompass primary school pupils learning about family relationships, friendships and kindness up to the age of seven, followed by lessons on gender equality, respectful relationships and online safety between the ages of seven and 11. At secondary school the lessons are to include sexuality, consent, rights and equity, as well as reproduction, with lessons on sexual health following at an \u201cappropriate stage,\u201d the Welsh government said. In England, relationships lessons in primary schools and sex education in secondary schools will be compulsory from September.

In the 1950s your name was changed and your identity sealed, never to be revealed. I was supposed to be grateful to the devout and emotionally cruel couple who supposedly \u201cchose me\u201d. I did not want to call them mummy or daddy but was forced to. I was continually told how lucky I was, and any questions were immediately hushed for fear of upsetting the adults. I was bad blood in need of tight control so I did not stray like my mother.</p> <p>I have seen over the years how adoption has swung in and out of fashion, but what I haven\u2019t seen is any recognition of the trauma experienced by the child when they are taken from their mother. Added to that, the trauma of never knowing what happened to you, why you were \u201cgiven away\u201d and who you really are is so cruel. When the law changed in the late 1970s it was still difficult to find anything out, and social workers had all the power. I eventually got my file, but most of it was blacked out or cut out for fear of upsetting third parties! What about me?</p> <p>Speak and really listen to adopted adults and you will hear the truth. It might not be the truth you want to hear, but it is the only way that change for the better can be implemented. <br><strong>Janice McKinley </strong><br><em>Leeds</em></p>",

And what was the Conservative party slogan for the 1951 general election? \u201cPreserving our traditional way of life.\u201d So from my perspective, the Conservatives have had their way. And here we are having the same old debate. Alan Graham Robinson Bjerreby, Denmark \u2022 I am 66 years old and I have never recovered from the harm that adoption did to me; I live with the trauma every day. In the 1950s your name was changed and your identity sealed, never to be revealed. I was supposed to be grateful to the devout and emotionally cruel couple who supposedly \u201cchose me\u201d. I did not want to call them mummy or daddy but was forced to. I was continually told how lucky I was, and any questions were immediately hushed for fear of upsetting the adults. I was bad blood in need of tight control so I did not stray like my mother. I have seen over the years how adoption has swung in and out of fashion, but what I haven\u2019t seen is any recognition of the trauma experienced by the child when they are taken from their mother. Added to that, the trauma of never knowing what happened to you, why you were \u201cgiven away\u201d and who you really are is so cruel. When the law changed in the late 1970s it was still difficult to find anything out, and social workers had all the power. I eventually got my file, but most of it was blacked out or cut out for fear of upsetting third parties! What about me? Speak and really listen to adopted adults and you will hear the truth. It might not be the truth you want to hear, but it is the only way that change for the better can be implemented. Janice McKinley Leeds",

The club\u2019s former president Miguel Archanco denied that the club had fixed games during his testimony, which followed that of Vizcay.</p> <p>Vizcay claimed Osasuna had paid \u20ac400,000 in cash for Getafe to lose at Osasuna in 2013 and that Betis were paid \u20ac250,000 to throw a match against them the following year. He said Osasuna had also paid Valladolid a \u20ac150,000 win bonus to beat Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a and a further \u20ac150,000 to Betis to defeat Celta Vigo. Deportivo and Celta were two teams fighting against relegation along with Osasuna in the 2012-13 season.</p> <p>The following season Vizcay claimed Osasuna made a \u20ac250,000 payment to Espanyol in return for a draw. A point was sufficient for Espanyol to survive; Osasuna ended up being relegated anyway.</p> <p>He further claimed Betis were paid another \u20ac400,000 for beating Valladolid, with whom Osasuna were competing to avoid relegation. Betis had already been relegated and might not have been sufficiently motivated without that payment, Vizcay said.</p> <p>Vizcay also said one of the two payments to Betis was made directly to three of their players in a garage in Seville. Jordi Figueras, Xavi Torres and Antonio Amaya are the three Betis players on trial. Vizcay identified Figueras and Torres in court but said he could not be sure the third man was Amaya on that occasion but he did identify him as the recipient of the earlier payment.</p> <p>He said he had confessed everything he knew to the president of the league, Javier Tebas, when he became aware La Liga\u2019s investigation was under way and that the Sports Council was carrying out an audit of the club\u2019s accounts. That confession was central to the case making it to court.</p> <p>Only the payments allegedly made to Betis are under investigation in this case, not the others.</p> <p>Archanco denied those allegations, telling the judge Osasuna had not fixed games nor ever paid players to that end. The only payment he admitted to was for Betis to beat Valladolid in 2014, a result that suited Osasuna.</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Spanish top-flight club Osasuna fixed football matches in an attempt to avoid relegation over two seasons, a court heard on Tuesday. The club\u2019s former secretary said Osasuna had paid Getafe and Real Betis to lose against them in 2012-13 and 2013-14 respectively and had made a further payment to Espanyol in return for a draw. \u00c1ngel Vizcay testified in the case led by the investigating judge Ferm\u00edn Otamendi and brought against 11 men: six former Osasuna directors, three former Betis players and two estate agents also accused of being involved. Vizcay also told the provincial court in Pamplona that Osasuna had paid third-party win bonuses to Valladolid and Betis. The club\u2019s former president Miguel Archanco denied that the club had fixed games during his testimony, which followed that of Vizcay. Vizcay claimed Osasuna had paid \u20ac400,000 in cash for Getafe to lose at Osasuna in 2013 and that Betis were paid \u20ac250,000 to throw a match against them the following year. He said Osasuna had also paid Valladolid a \u20ac150,000 win bonus to beat Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a and a further \u20ac150,000 to Betis to defeat Celta Vigo. Deportivo and Celta were two teams fighting against relegation along with Osasuna in the 2012-13 season. The following season Vizcay claimed Osasuna made a \u20ac250,000 payment to Espanyol in return for a draw. A point was sufficient for Espanyol to survive; Osasuna ended up being relegated anyway. He further claimed Betis were paid another \u20ac400,000 for beating Valladolid, with whom Osasuna were competing to avoid relegation. Betis had already been relegated and might not have been sufficiently motivated without that payment, Vizcay said. Vizcay also said one of the two payments to Betis was made directly to three of their players in a garage in Seville. Jordi Figueras, Xavi Torres and Antonio Amaya are the three Betis players on trial. Vizcay identified Figueras and Torres in court but said he could not be sure the third man was Amaya on that occasion but he did identify him as the recipient of the earlier payment. He said he had confessed everything he knew to the president of the league, Javier Tebas, when he became aware La Liga\u2019s investigation was under way and that the Sports Council was carrying out an audit of the club\u2019s accounts. That confession was central to the case making it to court. Only the payments allegedly made to Betis are under investigation in this case, not the others. Archanco denied those allegations, telling the judge Osasuna had not fixed games nor ever paid players to that end. The only payment he admitted to was for Betis to beat Valladolid in 2014, a result that suited Osasuna. The case continues.",

According to <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/01/18/keir-starmer-beats-rebecca-long-bailey-63-37-secon\">the most recent YouGov poll of Labour members</a>, Phillips\u2019 supporters are more likely to say that Corbyn has done badly as leader than the supporters of other candidates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27320575e4c8f31e1e074fee012292b959e8ad1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27320575e4c8f31e1e074fee012292b959e8ad1a/0_0_699_386/500.jpg\" alt=\"Polling of Labour members\" width=\"500\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling of Labour members</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouGov</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The<a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/bpvaml3meh/TimesResults_200115_LabMembers_w2.pdf\"> tables (pdf)</a> from the most recent YouGov poll also show that 60% of Labour members who say they would give Phillips their first-preference vote would choose Starmer as their second choice, and 25% would choose Nandy.

For example, a few days before polling day, on a visit to a factory near Sunderland in the north east, Johnson was repeatedly asked, by workers and journalists, about the impact of his Brexit plan on companies like Nissan. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/09/general-election-labour-sets-out-plan-for-first-100-days-in-office-live-news?page=with:block-5dee6a058f08951c7479d312#block-5dee6a058f08951c7479d312\">He insisted that companies reliant on EU supply chains had nothing to fear. </a>The Newcastle Chronicle has <a href=\"https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/chancellor-sajid-javid-backtracks-boris-17593151?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=sharebar\">accused Javid of going back on an election pledge made by Johnson.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Javid dismissed suggestions the government\u2019s \u2018no alignment\u2019 policy would damage business.</strong> When it was put to him that some firms thought his stance was irresponsible, he claimed that the government was working closely with business.

      "bodyText": "Jess Phillips has pulled out of the Labour leadership contest to replace Jeremy Corbyn, saying she is not the person to unite the party. Lisa Nandy\u2019s campaign to become the next Labour leader has received a significant boost after the UK\u2019s third biggest union endorsed her nomination. Boris Johnson has been defeated twice in the House of Lords today on his Brexit bill (see 3.48pm and 5.18pm), including on an amendment from Lord Dubs to reinsert provisions into the bill protecting unaccompanied child refugees. The government says it will reverse the defeats when the legislation returns to the Commons tomorrow. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has claimed the government is not politicising the death of the London Bridge terror attack victims by unveiling tougher prison sentences for the most serious offenders. The Welsh assembly has voted to withhold consent from the government\u2019s EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. Following the Stormont vote yesterday, and a Scottish parliament vote earlier this month, that means all three devolved assemblies in the UK have rejected the legislation. However, these votes only have symbolic force and will not stop Johnson implementing Brexit. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has dismissed suggestions that the government\u2019s decision not to align with EU rules after Brexit will damage British manufacturing. (See 9.31am.) In response the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: Increasingly Sajid Javid is looking completely out of touch with the reality our businesses are facing. He is reneging on the commitment that [Boris] Johnson gave to manufacturers during the election campaign that they would be protected. Jobs are being put at risk by Javid\u2019s rightwing ideology overriding common sense. Social mobility is in decline in Britain, with more than half of people saying the government is failing to do enough to help the least well off, according to a survey by ministers\u2019 advisory body on life chances. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. My colleague Heather Stewart has written an excellent long read giving the inside story of how Labour lost the election. It\u2019s here. Talking of YouGov, the polling organisation has this afternoon published some more results from its recent polling of the Labour party membership. The whole post is well worth reading, but here are three findings, and charts, that are particularly interesting. 1) Labour members, by a very large margin, would prefer the party to be a pro-fairness party than an anti-capitalist party. 2) While three-quarters of Labour members see Rebecca Long-Bailey as Corbynite, at least half of members see all her remaining rivals as neither Corbynite or Blairite but \u201csomething else\u201d. This is particularly helpful for Starmer who has been keen not to be identified with either the Corbynite or Blairite wing of the party. 3) Being Corbynite may have its advantages - because Corbyn is the most popular Labour leader from the last century with members. The government has just lost a fifth vote on the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. Peers voted for a Labour/Lib Dem amendment to include in the bill a line saying the government should take account of the Sewel convention, which says the UK government should not normally legislate on a matter devolved to one of the devolved administrations without the devolved body granting legislative consent. But this defeat was much narrower than the others. The opposition won by just 239 votes to 235 - a majority of four. Sorry. I wrongly had this down earlier as a Game of Thrones reference. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s from the Hunger Games. YouGov has published two polls of Labour membership since the leadership contest started, both suggesting Sir Keir Starmer is on course to win. This afternoon it has recalculated the numbers from its last poll, to take into account Jess Phillips dropping out, and it says this means Starmer could win on the first ballot. Polling party members is not easy, but in 2015, and again in 2016, the YouGov Labour leadership polls turned out to provide a good guide to the eventual result. Here is the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush on Lisa Nandy getting the GMB nomination. Here is Tim Roache, the GMB general secretary, explaining why his union is backing Lisa Nandy for Labour leader. Lisa Nandy is a breath of fresh air in the debate over Labour\u2019s future. The more members see of Lisa in this contest the more impressed they will be by her ambition, optimism and decisive leadership. GMB is proud to nominate her. Lisa won\u2019t shy away from the tough challenges or bold decisions that lie ahead, because she knows that after fifteen years of losing elections, more of the same won\u2019t cut it. A candidate entrenched in the union movement, Lisa gets the scale of the challenge. She will raise Labour\u2019s game with a bold agenda that puts people first and grounds politics in their lives. And this is what he said about why the GMB was backing Angela Rayner for deputy. For the members I represent, Angela Rayner shows that politics is about them and rooted in real life. To those people who believe that politics is not for the likes of them or have been told their whole lives not to get ideas above their station, Angela Rayner is a role model and an inspiration. One who walks the talk. The GMB is depicting Lisa Nandy as a Game of Thrones character, which may or may not be appropriate. Game of Thrones must be one of the few environments where the infighting and feuding is even worse than it is in the Labour party ... Lisa Nandy has issued this statement about getting the GMB nomination. She said: Labour is at a crossroads. To win again we will have to up our game, recover our ambition, and inspire a movement. The GMB, the biggest industrial union which speaks for more than half a million workers, has been offering that leadership time and time again in recent years. As I seek permission to lead us back to power as Labour\u2019s next prime minister I could not be more proud to have their support. The GMB is nominating Lisa Nandy for the Labour leadership, Sky\u2019s Joe Pike reports. Nandy already has the backing of the NUM. That means she just needs an endorsement from another union or from a socialist society. There are 20 of the latter, and only one of those has endorsed a candidate (Sera - Sir Keir Starmer), and so Nandy should not find it hard to pick up the final endorsement she needs. It might come from Chinese for Labour. This means that there are likely to be three names on the final ballot: Nandy, Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey. Emily Thornberry is still in the contest, but unless she gets a very surprise endorsement from either Unite or the CWU (Unite will almost certainly back Long-Bailey, and the CWU will almost certainly go for someone to the left of Thornberry), she will have to get nominations from 33 CLPs to stay in the contest. She has had almost a week already to work on these, and so far she has just two. In the remaining two and a half weeks, she needs to pick up another 31. It will be tricky ... Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, has said his Fine Gael party will only vote for an EU trade agreement that ensures a level playing field for Irish farmers, if they are re-elected after Ireland\u2019s general election on 8 February. His declaration is a sign of the complexity to come on the EU side of the next stage of Brexit talks with member states battling to protect their own interests. Coveney, who was in Brussels yesterday but back on the campaign stump at home today said: I was with Michel Barnier yesterday and we spent a lot of time talking about farming and fishing. He\u2019s somebody who understands this brief, only too well. If we do not succeed in getting a good trade deal in place, then the \u20ac5bn of food that we sell to the UK each year becomes a trade that that will be put under threat. With almost 50% of Ireland\u2019s beef exports and 47% of cheddar cheese going to the UK, reducing trade barriers in agriculture will be a red line for Ireland. Speaking in Fermoy Mart, in County Cork, he said that a seamless trade deal would include a zero tariff or quota regime. \u201cThese are serious issues, and they impact on every farm in the country, and by extension on every rural community in the country as well,\u201d he told farmers. Peers have passed the Dubs amendment by 300 votes to 220 - a majority of 80. That is Boris Johnson\u2019s fourth defeat in the Lords on the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. There were three last night. But this defeat is much bigger. Yesterday the government lost by 40 votes, 36 and 20 respectively. Tomorrow the bill will return to the Commons, and the government is planning to reverse all the Lords defeats. (See 12.55pm.) At that point, or soon after, the Lords is likely to back down. It almost always gives way when it gets involved in a stand-off with the elected house, and given that Johnson has just won a large majority on a manifesto promising to pass this legislation, which needs to become law quickly, it is hard to imagine peers getting involved in protracted \u201cping-pong\u201d (the process when a disputed bill goes back and forth between the Commons and the Lords) over this. In the debate on the Dubs amendment, just before the division was called a few minutes ago, Lady Williams of Trafford, a Home Office minister, said that there were more than 5,000 unaccompanied child refugees being cared for in England alone, a 146% increase since 2014. And she said in 2018 there were more than 3,000 asylum claims from unaccompanied children - the third highest intake of any EU member state. And she said the government was committed to resettling 5,000 people in the next year alone. Williams said the current rules already provided a route by which child refugees could join family members in the UK. Emily Thornberry and Lisa Nandy, two of the Labour leadership candidates, have both tweeted about Jess Phillips\u2019 decision to withdraw from the contest. In the Lords peers are now voting on the Dubs amendment. (See 12.23pm and 3.18pm.) Peers have resumed their debate on the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill and on the Dubs amendment. (See 12.23pm.) They had a break for lunch (unlike MPs, peers halt proceedings for lunch and dinner) and then there were Lords amendments. Here are some quotes from the morning debate on the Dubs amendment. I\u2019ve taken them from the Press Association wire. From Lord Kerr, the crossbencher and former head of the Foreign Office I have absolutely no idea why clause 37 [the original Dubs provision, taken out when the bill was redrafted after the election] isn\u2019t in this bill. I do not understand what the government are planning to do. I agree with Lord Dubs, wearing my Refugee Council hat I see [he is a Refugee Council trustee] a lot of evidence that the country takes this very seriously indeed, and that of all the issues we are discussing here, some of them constitutionally very important, some of them politically very important, of all the issues that we are discussing on this bill, this is probably the one that has the most public resonance that these unfortunate children should be looked after. And why the government want to take out of the statute book a commitment to try to look after them is something that the public will not understand, so I strongly urge the government to withdraw this clause. From the Bishop of Durham From these benches, my right reverend colleagues and I view this particular issue as a moral bellwether for the future of our country. We want to be known as a country that is welcoming and passionate and committed to playing our full part in responding to the deep issues that arise from the reality of refugees around the world. I believe the minister and the government do want to act with compassion, it is simply that what is proposed is not conveying this. In my mind this is not just a matter of trust, but a matter of priority. Where do the government\u2019s priorities lie? The action of including clause 37, removing the family reunion obligation from primary legislation, speaks louder and will be heard further beyond this place than promises of other legislation yet to be announced. From Lady Butler-Sloss, a crossbencher and a former high court judge What I am concerned about is urgency. It would be very easy for the government, intentionally or unintentionally, with everything else that goes along on Brexit, not to have a priority about these children. What we need to do is to retain the sense of urgency. Here is the full text of the statement Jess Phillips has released explaining why she is withdrawing from the Labour leadership contest. The election defeat that the Labour party faced at the last election was cataclysmic. We need to win 124 seats to just get a majority of one. I truly believe that unless we talk to the country on their terms, not just on ours, that we won\u2019t be able to make the gains we need to win an election - and do what everyone in the Labour movement wants to do, and that is make people\u2019s lives better. In order to do that, The Labour party will need to select a candidate who can unite all parts of our movement, the union movement, members and elected representatives. And I have to also be honest with myself, as I said I always would be throughout this campaign. At this time, that person is not me. In order to win the country, we are going to have to find a candidate, in this race, who can do all of that, and then take that message out to the country. A message of hope and change, that things can be better. Now, I want to send a message to all of the people who joined our campaign. Tens of thousands of people have signed up, and in doing that, tens of thousands of new people have joined the Labour party. It is brilliant they will get a say in this race.I want to say to those people. This is not the end. Together, we can now use our strength, to make the changes we want to make. To use our voices in the Labour party, and in the country, to make sure that the Labour party win elections again. This isn\u2019t the end. It\u2019s the beginning.I also want to send a message to all of those in the Jewish community, many of whom have been in touch with me to say that in me, they found somebody who would stand up for them. That doesn\u2019t change. I will always stand up, I will always speak out and I promise that we will change the problems in our party that we have seen. I\u2019m going to go out into the country and join the fight back. Because the Labour party is not about the job description you have. We are the strength of our common endeavour, and everybody who has joined in, now we go out into the country, in the local elections, the mayoral elections and we fight back. We make sure we are out there, speaking to the country, and making sure the Labour party can win elections again. Jess Phillips has released a video message confirming she is withdrawing from the leadership contest. Here is my colleague Owen Jones\u2019 take on Jess Phillips. Boris Johnson has had meeting with two foreign leaders in Downing Street today. Here he is with the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. And here he is with the Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta. The Unite union has finally paid the former Labour MP Anna Turley after her victory over the union in a libel case, my colleague Rajeev Syal reports. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, will update the Scottish parliament on her government\u2019s next steps toward a second independence referendum next week, it has been confirmed, a week after prime minister Boris Johnson refused in perpetuity to grant her the powers necessary to hold a legal vote. With various senior SNP figures suggesting that there will definitely/will definitely not be a second referendum in 2020 or invoking the civil disobedience of Ghandi\u2019s Indian independence movement, it\u2019s difficult to plot a course that sticks to Sturgeon\u2019s preferred timetable while maintaining a referendum that is a \u201cgold standard\u201d, as she has insisted when rejecting suggestions of a Catalonia-style poll. This comes as the Welsh parliament is expected later today to vote against Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill, following similar votes by the Stormont assembly on Monday and at Holyrood earlier in January, presenting the fairly unprecedented situation where all three devolved nations have rejected this most significant piece of legislation but, because all three votes are symbolic, it has zero impact on the bill\u2019s passage. There are currently five candidates still in the Labour leadership contest. (Clive Lewis pulled out in phase one, because he could not secure enough nominations from MPs.) If Jess Phillips does pull out this afternoon, some people may find that surprising because the two YouGov polls of Labour members conducted since the contest started have both shown her in third place - a long way behind the two favourites, Sir Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey, but ahead of Lisa Nandy and Emily Thornberry. But it is not enough to be popular with members. Under the party\u2019s leadership rules, which have been amended under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, candidates have to have a certain amount of support from constituency Labour parties (CLPs) or affiliates (unions or socialist societies) to be sure of a place on the final ballot. (See 10.13am and 11.17am.) One of the golden rules of politics is that the result of any election is hugely influenced by the rules that apply, and if the new thresholds were introduced under union pressure to keep a maverick centrist off the ballot (as many suspect), then they seem to have done the job. Phillips has always been disliked by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s supporters because she has been vocal in her criticism of him. According to the most recent YouGov poll of Labour members, Phillips\u2019 supporters are more likely to say that Corbyn has done badly as leader than the supporters of other candidates. The tables (pdf) from the most recent YouGov poll also show that 60% of Labour members who say they would give Phillips their first-preference vote would choose Starmer as their second choice, and 25% would choose Nandy. Second preferences are crucial because Labour uses the alternative vote in leadership contests and, with multiple candidates, a candidate would normally need second-preference votes (after the weakest person has been eliminated) to win. Next week\u2019s cabinet meeting will take place on Friday in the north of England to mark the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, Downing Street has said. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman told the lobby briefing: The prime minister and the cabinet have set out that they want to work for the entire country and they want to engage more widely across the UK and this is one of many opportunities to do so. And while we are talking about the lobby briefing, the Guido Fawkes website was live tweeting from the meeting this morning. You can read the feed here. The convention has always been that the meetings are embargoed until they are over (on the grounds that that saves journalists from having to file copy and ask questions at the same time), but the Guido Fawkes lot don\u2019t like the lobby and want to disrupt the status quo. Where this will all end up remains to be seen. As you can see from a glimpse at the Guido feed, quite a lot of what gets said at these briefings is unremarkable and a bit dull. From my colleague Rowena Mason, who was at the Downing Street lobby briefing These are from my colleague Heather Stewart on the Labour leadership. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From Sky\u2019s Joe Pike And here is Emily Thornberry on the GMB hustings. According to the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith, Thornberry says she is confident of getting enough nominations from CLPs or affiliates to make it onto the final ballot. (Other observers don\u2019t share her confidence - see 10.13am.) This is from the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith on the private Labour leadership hustings this morning hosted by the GMB\u2019s central executive committee. Earlier today my colleague Owen Jones posted this on Twitter. Sky\u2019s Joe Pike says union sources expect Jess Phillips to announce this afternoon that she will withdraw from the contest. As explained earlier (see 10.13am and 11.17am), because of the way the Labour leadership rules are operating, Phillips has very little chance of making it onto the final ballot anyway. In the light of that, it would be easy to see why she might be tempted to concede now. In the House of Lords peers are debating the report stage of the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill for the second day, and they have just started debating amendment 18, the one tabled by the Labour peer Lord Dubs that would reinstate provisions in the bill ensuring that the government remained bound by a commitment to accept unaccompanied child refugees wanting to join family members in the UK. The original EU (withdrawal agreement) bill contained this provision. But it was dropped when Boris Johnson published a new version of the bill after the general election. Ministers claim that their policy has not changed, and that they remain committed to allowing unaccompanied child refugees to join relatives in the UK. But they argue that this bill is not the right place for this to be set down in law. They say it could be addressed in a forthcoming immigration bill. Dubs told peers that he was prepared to accept the word of individual ministers. But he did not trust the government as a whole, he said. And he also insisted that this was a matter of decency, and that members of the public would support what he was proposing. He concluded his speech: If the argument is put to the British public, they tend to respond positively ... What we are talking about here is a very small number of children who would be positively affected by this measure. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m pretty keen on it. We\u2019ve had over 200,000 signatures on a petition supporting this provision. I believe we are essentially on the side of public opinion. I believe we are essentially on the side of humanity. I beg to move. The government is expected to lose when peers vote later this afternoon, although, with a majority of 80-plus in the Commons (it depends how you measure it), Boris Johnson should have no trouble reversing the defeat when the bill returns to the lower house tomorrow. From Bloomberg There is more coverage of President Trump\u2019s speech at Davos on my colleague Graeme Wearden\u2019s Davos live blog. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has claimed the government is not politicising the death of the London Bridge terror attack victims by unveiling tougher prison sentences for the most serious offenders, my colleague Kate Proctor reports. The Labour MP Justin Madders may be the first person in the party to call for a review of the way the party\u2019s leadership election rules are currently working. When Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader in 2015, candidates just needed nominations from 15% of MPs to get on the ballot. But subsequently the rules were changed. The 15% threshold was reduced to 10%, but, as a concession to the trade unions, a second hurdle was introduced - requiring candidates to get a certain number of nominations either from constituency Labour party, or from affiliate organisations. (See 10.13am.) At the time it was not widely acknowledged how restrictive this rule might be, particularly for a candidate like Emily Thornberry or Jess Phillips. The Labour party has refused Lisa Nandy\u2019s request to change the format of the leadership hustings, at least for now, HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh reports. Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite in the Labour leadership contest, told Sky News as he arrived for the private GMB hustings this morning this morning that his message to the union would be: \u201cThat the Labour party and the trade unions need to be shoulder to shoulder.\u201d And Lisa Nandy, another leadership candidate, told reporters as she arrived: I\u2019m looking forward to seeing a lot of friends in that room and working out how we rebuild the Labour party. HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh says that Nandy is right to expect a warm welcome, but that this does not mean she will get the GMB nomination. In a briefing written last night he says: The GMB has a strong tradition of promoting smart, soft left women (new MP Sarah Owen replaced the legendary late Mary Turner on the NEC until her election to parliament) and with Nandy campaign chair Louise Haigh another alumnus, it could be \u2018the women-wot-win-it\u2019. A big endorsement could provide the launchpad she desperately needs to show members she\u2019s a heavyweight figure in this race (remember her \u2018preferential strategy\u2019 depends entirely on coming ahead of Long-Bailey, a big ask). But the GMB\u2019s central executive council (CEC) is made up of 55 \u2018lay\u2019 members and they\u2019re proud of the democratic, regional structure. Although there are big Nandy fans (dubbed \u2018Nandynistas\u2019 by one party insider who shares my age and knowledge of Latin American leftists) in senior GMB posts, it\u2019s possible that the 55 council members have picked up the same pro-Starmer rank-and-file sentiment as other unions. According to Sky\u2019s Joe Pike, Jess Phillips is not attending the private hustings for the GMB\u2019s central executive committee taking place before the union decides which candidate it will nominate. She was not likely to win the GMB nomination anyway, The BBC\u2019s Jessica Parker says Phillips had a prior engagement. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain Emily Thornberry, the Labour leadership candidate, said the party should choose a woman to replace Jeremy Corbyn because she said Boris Johnson had a problem dealing with female political opponents. She said:L It is an advantage to be a woman leader at this time because I think Boris Johnson has a woman problem, most definitely. He certainly has a problem with me. I think the Labour Party should think about that. She also said she favoured the wealthy and businesses paying more in tax. She said: Of course, if you have broader shoulders, then you should be paying more. Tax rates have changed under 10 years of the Tories - people who earn the most are actually paying less in terms of the percentage. Tax rates have gone down, tax rates on big companies have gone down. I\u2019d put them back up to make them the average for rich countries around the world. This is broadly in line with what Labour was proposing in its 2019 election manifesto. Thornberry is one of five candidates still in the race, but she and Jess Phillips face a high risk of being eliminated on Friday 14 February, the next deadline in the contest. All five candidates have already cleared the first hurdle in the election - getting nominations from 22 MPs or MEPs. But by 14 February they need to hit another threshold: either nominations from at least three affiliate organisations, of which at least two must be unions, comprising at least 5% of the entire affiliate vote; or nominations from at least 33 constituency Labour parties (5% of the total). Sir Keir Starmer has already cleared this second hurdle, through the affiliates route, and Rebecca Long-Bailey is thought to be safe. Lisa Nandy\u2019s fate may hinge on whether the GMB decide to nominate her this afternoon. But Thornberry and Phillips seem to have very little chance of getting the big union backing they need to qualify through affiliates (without the support of one of the big five unions, it is impossible to reach the 5% target), and they will probably find it hard to win the backing of 33 CLPs. According to the @CLPNominations Twitter feed, a reliable guide to CLP nominations, Starmer has 13 nominations so far, Long-Bailey has four, Thornberry and two, and Nandy and Phillips have none. The number of people who are unemployment dropped by 7,000 to just below 1.31m in the three months to November, according to new data. As the Press Association reports, that means that 3.8% of people who want to work do not have a job, largely unchanged on the previous quarter. However, the figure is 0.2 percentage points lower than a year earlier, according to numbers from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It means that unemployment is currently at its lowest level since December 1974. UPDATE: I\u2019ve amended this post to make it clear that these figures refer to the unemployment figures, not the claimant count figures. The UK will leave the EU at the end of next week and this morning Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is attending his last Ecofin, the regular meeting for EU finance ministers, as a member. In a clip for broadcasters on his way, he was asked about the row generated by his interview with the Financial Times (paywall) at the weekend in which he insisted that that the UK would not stay aligned to EU rules after Brexit. He made two main points. Javid claimed that business had had ample warning about the government\u2019s plan not to remain aligned to EU rules. Asked about the reaction to his FT interview, in which he said \u201cthere will not be alignment, we will not be a rule taker, we will not be in the single market and we will not be in the customs union\u201d, he said: We have been very clear now for many months, and of course in our recent election as well, as we leave the EU we will not be in the single market, we will not be in the customs union, and we will not be rule takers. At the same time, of course, we want a deep, comprehensive free trade agreement, and that\u2019s what we are working on. This is not wholly true because there were times during the general election campaign when Boris Johnson implied the opposite. For example, a few days before polling day, on a visit to a factory near Sunderland in the north east, Johnson was repeatedly asked, by workers and journalists, about the impact of his Brexit plan on companies like Nissan. He insisted that companies reliant on EU supply chains had nothing to fear. The Newcastle Chronicle has accused Javid of going back on an election pledge made by Johnson. Javid dismissed suggestions the government\u2019s \u2018no alignment\u2019 policy would damage business. When it was put to him that some firms thought his stance was irresponsible, he claimed that the government was working closely with business. And when asked if his comment to the FT about how some firms would not benefit from Brexit meant the government was prepared to \u201csacrifice some elements of manufacturing and industry\u201d, he replied: No, not at all. We look forward with confidence as we strike that new free trade agreement with our European friends, as we strike new free trade agreements across the world, it will be a very important time for British business. And I can see a British economy that continues to go from strength to strength. This is slightly different from the message he gave to the FT. Speaking to the FT, he said: \u201cThere will be an impact on business one way or the other, some will benefit, some won\u2019t.\u201d We are expecting more Brexit news as the day goes on, not least from the House of Lords, where the government faces more defeats on the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 9.30am: Unemployment figures are published. 10am: Labour leadership candidates address the GMB\u2019s 60-strong central executive committee at a private meeting. 11am: Peers resume their debate on the EU (withdrawal agreement bill). The government is facing further defeats following the three votes it lost last night. 11.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 11.35am: Johnson meets the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, in Downing Street. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. Around 4pm: The GMB is due to announce who it is nominating for the Labour leadership and deputy leadership. And in Brussels at some point today European commission officials will be briefing EU27 diplomats on their plans for how to schedule the next phase of the Brexit talks. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news.

      "bodyText": "UK investors could seize a $24bn investment opportunity by helping to connect millions of people without access to electricity to off-grid home solar power systems. The market for pay-as-you-go home solar packages is expected to boom in Africa, where millions of homes are using mobile technology to rent low-cost solar panels. UK companies have played a leading role in helping more than five million households sign up to pay-as-you-go home solar systems in the past four years. But with 600 million people without access to an electricity grid, there is huge potential for future investment. A report by Kleos Advisory, published during the first UK-Africa Investment Summit in London, has found that the commercial opportunity from off-grid solar panels could generate about $24bn (\u00a318bn) a year. The market is growing rapidly since the collapse in the cost of solar panel technologies and the emergence of mobile banking and affordable financing in the continent\u2019s fast-growing economies. Households that earn an income are increasingly using mobile phones to rent small-scale solar panels, and ultra-efficient electric lighting strips and appliances to access electricity for the first time. Once the solar panels are paid off, households own the equipment outright and in effect have free energy. Many then choose to upgrade their packages to add televisions and electric cookers. The off-grid solar market is expected to grow rapidly, in part because eight of the world\u2019s 15 fastest-growing economies are in Africa. Tedd George, the author of the report, said the combination of solar technology and affordable financing was \u201cdriving an economic transformation in Africa, making the \u2018unbankable\u2019 bankable and embedding African consumers in the digital economy\u201d. UK companies including Azuri Technologies, which commissioned the report, and Bboxx are racing to corner the market for off-grid solar in Africa with the help of private investment and major international companies. Azuri sells its home solar systems in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Nigeria, and Bboxx is active in Kenya, Togo, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mali, Rwanda, Senegal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria. The scale of the off-grid solar market across Africa has emerged as UK investment leaders consider future investment in the continent after Brexit. Tony Blair said the summit this week \u201cshould open a new chapter in Britain\u2019s relationship with Africa\u201d to one based on \u201ceconomic cooperation rather than simply an aid-based, donor-recipient relationship\u201d. The former Labour prime minister said: \u201cIf we can use the UK-Africa Investment Summit to become a true economic partner to African countries, it would be of great strategic benefit to the continent and to the UK.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK toy industry suffered \u201cdifficult\u201d trading conditions last year due to falling consumer confidence as a result of Brexit and the snap general election, manufacturers have said. The British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA) \u2013 which represents more than 80% of the industry in the UK \u2013 released fresh figures showing that overall sales had slumped by 6% to \u00a33.2bn in 2019 amid high street gloom. However, online sales of toys and games were up 2% over the 12 months to give a 37% market share. Predictions that 2019 would be \u201cthe year of the movies\u201d failed to materialise, with many blockbuster titles such as Frozen II and Star Wars launched too late \u2013 and too close to Christmas \u2013 to give the sector a much-needed boost.

      "body": "<h2><strong>HUGS AND SQUIRRELS</strong></h2> \n<p>Less than two and a half years have passed since the evening in October 2017 when Manchester City squeaked past Wolves on penalties in the Rumbelows Cup, but in case the match has slipped your mind here\u2019s a reminder of the key incidents: a squirrel ran on the pitch, did a fair bit of squeaking past Wolves itself, and eventually had to be captured by groundstaff, who had previously and unsuccessfully attempted to literally sweep it away with a broom. Also, there were some penalties.</p> \n<p>That squirrel, readers, was a bushy-tailed beauty. A fluffy-bellied acorn-obsessive of the most endearing sort. If forced to compare it with, say, the squirrel that interrupted the Arsenal v Villarreal Big Cup quarter-final of 2006, it was far more impressive of tail and also, in our humble opinion, attitude, even if it lacked the catchy nickname (Highbury\u2019s rodent having been instantly christened Squirrel Regis). In 2013 a match between QPR and Leicester was held up by a pitch-invading squirrel, which presumably hadn\u2019t been informed that the Foxes no longer play at Filbert Street (a filbert being an archaic word for a hazelnut, you see). And anyway they were playing away, which further hindered its pursuit of nuts but, on the positive side, at least allowed the critter to be named the Loftus Rodent.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/20/arsenal-chelsea-mikel-arteta-hopes-transfers\">Beating Chelsea is essential for Arsenal\u2019s top-four hopes, says Mikel Arteta</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Today is a great day to share a squirrel story or two, because it\u2019s International Squirrel Appreciation Day. Happy International Squirrel Appreciation Day everyone! Except to whoever decided to hold it while a good number of squirrels are hibernating, which seems the kind of wilfully unkind act that only a squirrel non-appreciator would consider.</p> \n<p>Also today: International Hugging Day. Hugs have even more footballing associations than squirrels. Everybody\u2019s at it, with varying results. As Damien Duff once said of then-Chelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: \u201cI was coming into the tunnel and he saw me and gave me a hug. He said a couple of words into my ear and I went out there and had probably the best half of football I had all season.\u201d Which was probably not Mourinho\u2019s intention, given that Duff was playing for Fulham against Chelsea at the time. Mourinho once spoke about a hug he shared with Frank Lampard\u2019s Frank Lampard after the 2005 Carling Cup final. \u201cThis looks like a hug, but it\u2019s more,\u201d he cooed. \u201cThis is a hug that shows we trust each other. Without words he\u2019s saying to me \u2018Thanks\u2019 and I\u2019m saying to him \u2018Thanks\u2019.\u201d This is rather a lot for a simple squeeze to communicate, but that\u2019s why hugs are good enough to deserve a day.</p> \n<p>Six Premier League games will be played on Tuesday night, and we are more likely to see hugs than squirrels. The Fiver certainly recommends them to all readers, and not only on International Hugging Day. Just remember to ask for permission.</p> \n<h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live\">Join Simon Burnton from 8.15pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Chelsea 2-1 Arsenal</a>.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that the result made you cry.

As well as a couple of hundred words on ghostbustin\u2019 Pards, the letter o\u2019 the day was written by David Madden, either a namesake of the man who came on as a substitute in both the first match and the replay or perhaps (I can dream) the man himself. More recently, Jason Puncheon\u2019s goal in the 2016 final was one of the most joyous moments I have ever experienced in football, only to be shot to pieces 10 seconds later \u2013 the mere sight of Pardew dancing on the sideline made it inevitable Palace were going to lose. For ADO\u2019s sake, let\u2019s hope he forgot to pack his dancing shoes\u201d \u2013 Ed Taylor.</p> \n<p>\u201cBet this is the only missive you get regarding Pardew that is not 100% negative. As a Baggie, I too was dismayed that his few months in charge turned out so badly. Players are influenced by the media so he had challenges in the dressing room from the off. And, worse, he was trying to overcome Pulisball, which most of us hated.

      "bodyText": "HUGS AND SQUIRRELS Less than two and a half years have passed since the evening in October 2017 when Manchester City squeaked past Wolves on penalties in the Rumbelows Cup, but in case the match has slipped your mind here\u2019s a reminder of the key incidents: a squirrel ran on the pitch, did a fair bit of squeaking past Wolves itself, and eventually had to be captured by groundstaff, who had previously and unsuccessfully attempted to literally sweep it away with a broom. Also, there were some penalties. That squirrel, readers, was a bushy-tailed beauty. A fluffy-bellied acorn-obsessive of the most endearing sort. If forced to compare it with, say, the squirrel that interrupted the Arsenal v Villarreal Big Cup quarter-final of 2006, it was far more impressive of tail and also, in our humble opinion, attitude, even if it lacked the catchy nickname (Highbury\u2019s rodent having been instantly christened Squirrel Regis). In 2013 a match between QPR and Leicester was held up by a pitch-invading squirrel, which presumably hadn\u2019t been informed that the Foxes no longer play at Filbert Street (a filbert being an archaic word for a hazelnut, you see). And anyway they were playing away, which further hindered its pursuit of nuts but, on the positive side, at least allowed the critter to be named the Loftus Rodent. Today is a great day to share a squirrel story or two, because it\u2019s International Squirrel Appreciation Day. Happy International Squirrel Appreciation Day everyone! Except to whoever decided to hold it while a good number of squirrels are hibernating, which seems the kind of wilfully unkind act that only a squirrel non-appreciator would consider. Also today: International Hugging Day. Hugs have even more footballing associations than squirrels. Everybody\u2019s at it, with varying results. As Damien Duff once said of then-Chelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: \u201cI was coming into the tunnel and he saw me and gave me a hug. He said a couple of words into my ear and I went out there and had probably the best half of football I had all season.\u201d Which was probably not Mourinho\u2019s intention, given that Duff was playing for Fulham against Chelsea at the time. Mourinho once spoke about a hug he shared with Frank Lampard\u2019s Frank Lampard after the 2005 Carling Cup final. \u201cThis looks like a hug, but it\u2019s more,\u201d he cooed. \u201cThis is a hug that shows we trust each other. Without words he\u2019s saying to me \u2018Thanks\u2019 and I\u2019m saying to him \u2018Thanks\u2019.\u201d This is rather a lot for a simple squeeze to communicate, but that\u2019s why hugs are good enough to deserve a day. Six Premier League games will be played on Tuesday night, and we are more likely to see hugs than squirrels. The Fiver certainly recommends them to all readers, and not only on International Hugging Day. Just remember to ask for permission. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Simon Burnton from 8.15pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Chelsea 2-1 Arsenal. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI\u2019m sorry that the result made you cry. We promise that from now until the end we will have a great championship and you will smile with us again. We are waiting for you at the stadium. A big hug\u201d \u2013 Napoli\u2019s Lorenzo Insigne apologises to a nine-year-old after the team\u2019s 2-0 home defeat by Fiorentina made the boy burst into tears. FIVER LETTERS \u201cContinuing on the Alan Pardew/Ghostbusters riff (yesterday\u2019s Fiver), will ADO Den Haag appoint a female manager in 30 years\u2019 time, who does a perfectly serviceable job before being hounded out by an army of inexplicably angry keyboard warriors?\u201d \u2013 Tom Atkins. \u201cAs a Crystal Palace fan, yesterday\u2019s Fiver evoked some fond memories of one of the greatest moments in my team\u2019s long history, and indeed the earliest football thing from my own lifetime I can properly remember \u2013 the 1990 FA Cup final. As well as a couple of hundred words on ghostbustin\u2019 Pards, the letter o\u2019 the day was written by David Madden, either a namesake of the man who came on as a substitute in both the first match and the replay or perhaps (I can dream) the man himself. More recently, Jason Puncheon\u2019s goal in the 2016 final was one of the most joyous moments I have ever experienced in football, only to be shot to pieces 10 seconds later \u2013 the mere sight of Pardew dancing on the sideline made it inevitable Palace were going to lose. For ADO\u2019s sake, let\u2019s hope he forgot to pack his dancing shoes\u201d \u2013 Ed Taylor. \u201cBet this is the only missive you get regarding Pardew that is not 100% negative. As a Baggie, I too was dismayed that his few months in charge turned out so badly. Players are influenced by the media so he had challenges in the dressing room from the off. And, worse, he was trying to overcome Pulisball, which most of us hated. His big mistake was thinking he could do that without any new players (no money, which continues to dog the future despite our revived fortunes). I wish him well\u201d \u2013 Peter Hehir.

      "body": "<p>Danny McBride has been a lot of arrogant men over the years. He\u2019s napalmed jungles for fun. He\u2019s pronounced himself the world\u2019s greatest baseball player \u2013 despite a paunch like a department-store Santa. He has made deluded braggadocio into an artform and recently, he achieved its holiest of holy grails.</p> <p>\u201cKanye asked me to play him in a movie of his life,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThat was a pretty stunning phone call to get. I don\u2019t know why he wanted me to do it. Maybe that sense of ego I\u2019m able to portray? I have no clue.\u201d</p> <p>This, however, is not the project he is here to promote, though it is just as riotous as you imagine a Kanye biopic would be. McBride is in the UK for the launch of his third HBO sitcom, The Righteous Gemstones, a spoof about a money-grubbing church family in the US South. As he lolls affably on a sofa at a Soho hotel, it\u2019s hard to reconcile the humble McBride with characters like West, or the conceited televangelist Jesse Gemstone.</p> <p>He emphasises the luck behind his big break, which thrust him almost instantaneously from dead end jobs into critically acclaimed comedies and Hollywood roles alongside Tom Cruise, Ben Stiller and Robert Downey Jr. And it\u2019s all down to the fact that one day in high school, he decided to go to the toilet in the middle of a class.</p> <p>\u201cAh, I think about that piss often,\u201d says McBride. \u201cI passed this kid in the hall by chance who was dropping his resume off for the North Carolina School of the Arts. I was like: \u2018What\u2019s that? I\u2019ve never heard of that!\u2019 and he was like: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s this new film school.\u2019 I applied and got in and he sadly didn\u2019t.

McBride as Kenny Powers in Eastbound and Down.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There, he met long-term collaborators Jody Hill and David Gordon Green. Inspired by a love of English comedy (think Ricky Gervais and Steve Coogan), Hill and McBride decided to write a character \u201cthat had an underlying sadness \u2013 something pathetic about them which makes you unsure whether you\u2019re meant to hate or like them\u201d. Fist Foot Way, a low-budget film starring McBride as an egotistical taekwondo teacher, saw Will Ferrell sign the pair to his production company. It also earned them an invite to the set of Judd Apatow\u2019s Knocked Up, where McBride found the likes of Seth Rogen quoting lines back to him. \u201cIt was nuts.

      "bodyText": "Danny McBride has been a lot of arrogant men over the years. He\u2019s napalmed jungles for fun. He\u2019s pronounced himself the world\u2019s greatest baseball player \u2013 despite a paunch like a department-store Santa. He has made deluded braggadocio into an artform and recently, he achieved its holiest of holy grails. \u201cKanye asked me to play him in a movie of his life,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThat was a pretty stunning phone call to get. I don\u2019t know why he wanted me to do it. Maybe that sense of ego I\u2019m able to portray? I have no clue.\u201d This, however, is not the project he is here to promote, though it is just as riotous as you imagine a Kanye biopic would be. McBride is in the UK for the launch of his third HBO sitcom, The Righteous Gemstones, a spoof about a money-grubbing church family in the US South. As he lolls affably on a sofa at a Soho hotel, it\u2019s hard to reconcile the humble McBride with characters like West, or the conceited televangelist Jesse Gemstone. He emphasises the luck behind his big break, which thrust him almost instantaneously from dead end jobs into critically acclaimed comedies and Hollywood roles alongside Tom Cruise, Ben Stiller and Robert Downey Jr. And it\u2019s all down to the fact that one day in high school, he decided to go to the toilet in the middle of a class. \u201cAh, I think about that piss often,\u201d says McBride. \u201cI passed this kid in the hall by chance who was dropping his resume off for the North Carolina School of the Arts. I was like: \u2018What\u2019s that? I\u2019ve never heard of that!\u2019 and he was like: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s this new film school.\u2019 I applied and got in and he sadly didn\u2019t. I stole his life.\u201d There, he met long-term collaborators Jody Hill and David Gordon Green. Inspired by a love of English comedy (think Ricky Gervais and Steve Coogan), Hill and McBride decided to write a character \u201cthat had an underlying sadness \u2013 something pathetic about them which makes you unsure whether you\u2019re meant to hate or like them\u201d. Fist Foot Way, a low-budget film starring McBride as an egotistical taekwondo teacher, saw Will Ferrell sign the pair to his production company. It also earned them an invite to the set of Judd Apatow\u2019s Knocked Up, where McBride found the likes of Seth Rogen quoting lines back to him. \u201cIt was nuts. I\u2019d never even been on a real movie set before,\u201d he recalls. \u201cJody and I went back to his apartment and were like: \u2018Is this happening? Is this real?\u2019\u201d Within a year, McBride was playing a dopey drug dealer in Pineapple Express and an explosives expert in action movie parody Tropic Thunder.

      "bodyText": "On Monday, Dior\u2019s haute couture show took place within the mighty womb of a female deity, created by formidable American artist Judy Chicago. Guests were seated within a custom version of an unrealised sculpture the influential feminist had first proposed in 1977 as Inflatable Mother Goddess. Chicago\u2019s proposition \u201cWhat If Women Ruled the World?\u201d set the tone for a fashion collection inspired by proto-feminist heroines dating back to prehistory. Embroidered banners, three-metres high, posed follow-on questions: \u201cWould Buildings Resemble Wombs?\u201d \u201cWould God Be Female?\u201d \u201cWould There Be Violence?\u201d \u201cWould Both Women and Men Be Gentle?\u201d It was a spectacular backdrop for the fashion show, though Chicago pointed out that the sculpture and its hangings were more than that. \u201cWe made art,\u201d she told the New York Times. This is not the first time Maria Grazia Chiuri, artistic director of Dior, has looked to women artists for inspiration. For her second collection, models trod the runway in Breton tops embroidered with \u201cWhy Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\u201d in tribute to art historian Linda Nochlin. Ever since, feminist art has been as much of a house signature as the bar jacket. The spring/summer 2018 couture show paid tribute to sexually upfront surrealist Leonor Fini. Last spring, ready-to-wear was shown surrounded by Italian gender provocateur Tomaso Binga\u2019s naked Mural Alphabets. The setting for the couture show last June was designed by the magnificently forthright and inventive Penny Slinger: the collection closed with a golden dress shaped like a doll\u2019s house in tribute to the British-born artist\u2019s psychologically charged work. These spectacular collaborations are not gimmicks. As an art nerd they may excite me, but I don\u2019t kid myself that the fashion world will necessarily thrill to collaborations with less-known octogenarian feminists. These are not easy or flippant references: internationally renowned, Chicago is a better-known exception among those whose work Chiuri has celebrated on the runway. For all, the Dior collaboration offered a wider audience \u2013 and, I imagine, a welcome injection of cash toward the end of uncommercial careers. As Chicago has pointed out: \u201cIt\u2019s no fun to be old and poor.\u201d Chiuri is to be congratulated.

      "bodyText": "Sevilla have agreed a fee with LA Galaxy for the Mexico striker Javier Hern\u00e1ndez. In an interview published on Tuesday with the Los Angeles Times, the 31-year-old said it was \u201cthe right time, the right opportunity\u201d to make the move to the MLS club. The Galaxy confirmed the move on Tuesday morning, and a photo of Hern\u00e1ndez in the club\u2019s shirt appeared at the top of their Twitter page. Reports say the Galaxy paid \u20ac8.5m ($9.4m) for Hern\u00e1ndez, and he will earn around $6m a year under the terms of a three-year deal. During his career in Europe, Hern\u00e1ndez played for high-profile clubs including Manchester United and Real Madrid. However, many believe he never quite lived up to his potential, and the last time Hern\u00e1ndez scored more than 10 league goals in a campaign was for Bayer Leverkusen in the 2016-17 season. However, he denied he was moving to MLS for an easier ride. \u201cI\u2019m going to be playing,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez told the LA Times. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want in my life. People are going to say it was because I couldn\u2019t make it [in Europe], but sometimes in football there are things that are not in your hands.\u201d He added that he had spoken to his compatriot Jonathan Dos Santos, who also plays for the Galaxy, about life in MLS before making the move. \u201cJonathan told me the league is very underrated,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cI really believe you don\u2019t go there to retire.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez is Mexico\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer with 52 goalsand has been viewed as an attractive target for MLS clubs, particularly the LA teams, who have large Mexican-American fanbases. \u201cI\u2019m going to be able to play in front of a lot of Mexican fans, Galaxy fans, American fans,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s great about football. They give you a lot of opportunities.\u201d Chris Klein, Galaxy\u2019s president, hailed the signing as a signal of the club\u2019s ambition. \u201cThe LA Galaxy continue to pursue top talent across the world that will improve our team,\u201d said Klein. \u201cJavier is one of the most successful players in our region and an iconic figure in this community.\u201d The Galaxy are the most successful club in MLS history, with five titles, although they have not reached an MLS Cup final since their last victory in 2014. They lost their highest profile player, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, at the end of last season shortly before he rejoined Milan.",

At the grass roots, it is strongly leaning towards Starmer, and it is this, rather than any resurgence of the centre, which explains his early and consistent lead in all members\u2019 polls.

      "bodyText": "Lisa Nandy\u2019s campaign to become the next Labour leader has received a significant boost after the UK\u2019s third biggest union endorsed her nomination. The Wigan MP was confirmed as the GMB\u2019s pick on Tuesday after a hustings involving the four remaining candidates. The union\u2019s 60-strong executive also nominated Angela Rayner in the deputy leadership race, in which Rayner is the runaway favourite. The GMB\u2019s backing was seen as the only viable route for Nandy to gain enough affiliate support to make it to the next round. She already has the support of the National Union of Mineworkers and will have to seek a further endorsement by a socialist society. \u201cTo win again we will have to up our game, recover our ambition and inspire a movement,\u201d Nandy said after the decision was announced. \u201cThe GMB, the biggest industrial union, which speaks for more than half a million workers, has been offering that leadership time and time again in recent years. As I seek permission to lead us back to power as Labour\u2019s next prime minister, I could not be more proud to have their support.\u201d On Monday Keir Starmer became the first candidate to confirm his place in the final ballot after receiving the support of the retail union Usdaw. He had already been backed by Unison and the environmental group Sera. Rebecca Long-Bailey is also expected to make the final ballot. She is favourite to win the support of Unite and the Communication Workers Union and has already received the backing of the grassroots organisation Momentum. Party rules say a candidate must win the nomination of at least two trade unions plus another affiliate comprising 5% of affiliate members. The only other route on to the ballot is by receiving nominations from at least 5% of constituency Labour parties. Earlier on Tuesday, Jess Phillips dropped out of the race after failing to gain the support of a single socialist society or trade union. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, is still in the race but also lacks support from affiliates. Tim Roache, the GMB\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cLisa Nandy is a breath of fresh air in the debate over Labour\u2019s future.

I am not naturally athletic and was sluggish and tired from changing jobs and cities. So I decided to give it a crack for reasons I\u2019m still unsure about.</p> <p>The first class consisted of various warm-up drills, which included hip escapes, where you scoot backwards on the floor down the mat, forward rolls (sort of like a somersault) and backwards rolls, where you roll over your shoulder. I was startled and embarrassed by my lack of coordination in these seemingly basic moves, but I was with lots of beginners, at least.</p> <p>I had never felt so confused, embarrassed and out of sync with my body before, but by the end of the class, I felt the expansive excitement of having learned something.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After that first class, it became all I could think about</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was going to have to come back to get the hang of this.

That night, at home, I repeatedly googled \u201cHow to survive your first month of BJJ\u201d and \u201cWhat every new white belt should know\u201d. I had to know.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/14/fitness-tips-brazilian-jiujitsu\">Fitness tips: three benefits of Brazilian jiu-jitsu</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though the nerd vs jock trope is as old and tired as most clich\u00e9s, as a book editor and poet I definitely over-identified as the nerd my whole life. But over time, jiu jitsu has sunk itself deep into my veins. After that first class, it soon became all I could think about.</p> <p>To those outside, it can appear to be a cult.

      "bodyText": "Three years ago \u2013 five months after moving cities and one week after quitting smoking cold turkey \u2013 I turned up at a mixed martial-arts gym in Melbourne for the free trial class I\u2019d booked: Introduction to Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I am not naturally athletic and was sluggish and tired from changing jobs and cities. So I decided to give it a crack for reasons I\u2019m still unsure about. The first class consisted of various warm-up drills, which included hip escapes, where you scoot backwards on the floor down the mat, forward rolls (sort of like a somersault) and backwards rolls, where you roll over your shoulder. I was startled and embarrassed by my lack of coordination in these seemingly basic moves, but I was with lots of beginners, at least. I had never felt so confused, embarrassed and out of sync with my body before, but by the end of the class, I felt the expansive excitement of having learned something. I was going to have to come back to get the hang of this. As I watched the coach demonstrate a sweep effortlessly over and over again, the part of my brain that thought \u201cI want to do that!\u201d won out over the parts that were embarrassed and scared. That night, at home, I repeatedly googled \u201cHow to survive your first month of BJJ\u201d and \u201cWhat every new white belt should know\u201d. I had to know. Though the nerd vs jock trope is as old and tired as most clich\u00e9s, as a book editor and poet I definitely over-identified as the nerd my whole life. But over time, jiu jitsu has sunk itself deep into my veins. After that first class, it soon became all I could think about. To those outside, it can appear to be a cult. We wear funny-looking outfits (either a gi \u2013 jacket, pants and belt \u2013 or, for no-gi, spats and a tight-fitting rashguard). If you are friends with a BJJ practitioner, they\u2019ve likely tried more than once to coax you to try a class at their gym. The sport was introduced to Australia in 1994, and interest in it has been on the rise lately. Figures are hard to come by, but it is estimated there are 15,000 practitioners in Australia today.

You don\u2019t have to worry about being kicked or punched in the face. Instead, you could tear an anterior cruciate ligament, or even knee yourself in the nose. How could you not like that?

      "bodyText": "The boss of the Australian bus company Greyhound has warned its workers they could be caught \u201cin the crossfire\u201d after signing a contract to help build the Adani coal project in Queensland. The email from the chief executive, Alex de Waal, seen by Guardian Australia, asked staff not to \u201cundermine your colleagues or brand\u201d by sharing internal updates or posting to social media. Before the 6 January email, Greyhound had not been linked to the Adani project and the company told Guardian Australia it had not been targeted by protesters. The email revealed the company, which has more than 600 staff, had won a three-month contract \u201cwith an opportunity for extension\u201d with the construction firm BMD, which is building the mine\u2019s railway from the Galilee Basin to Abbot Point. \u201cThe project may create concerns to individual team members in light of the international political, environmental, social and economic debate about climate change underway in the media,\u201d the message read. Greyhound is a widely recognised Australian brand that says it carries 5 million passengers more than 38m kilometres a year. The company actively promotes bus travel as a less emissions intensive alternative to flying and driving private cars. Construction work has begun on the Indian-owned Adani mine \u2013 one of the most controversial fossil fuel projects in Australia\u2019s history, which will extract coal for export to power stations. \u201cServicing BMD is not Greyhound taking a stand on climate change or any other important environmental topic facing our nation and the world,\u201d the email said. \u201cGreyhound could become one of many companies in the crossfire of the anti-Adani campaign,\u201d De Waal said in the email. \u201cThank you for being courageous in servicing the regions and customers that mean so much to our business.\u201d Staff in Townsville, Emerald, Clermont, Belyando Crossing and Mackay would \u201cplay a role\u201d in transferring workers, the email said. \u201cYou are entitled to your views and we respect them,\u201d it said. Employees were asked to \u201cutilise the internal communication channels rather than discussing sensitive business matters with external parties\u201d. In a Q&amp;A section of the email, the company told staff it had \u201cdecided to be courageous\u201d in taking the contract. Instructions were provided to staff \u201cif you are approached by media or protestors\u201d, asking them to \u201cstay calm\u201d, to refer people to Greyhound\u2019s head office, and then to \u201cwalk away and go to a place of safety\u201d before contacting a manager \u201cimmediately\u201d. Defending the company\u2019s environmental credentials, the email said the company wanted to \u201ctransition to electric vehicles on reef routes\u201d. The email noted that De Waal is the chairman of the Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, a conservation group led by Andy Ridley, a co-founder of Earth Hour, and promoted by Alan Jones at its launch in 2016. Ridley joined as chief executive in 2017 and relaunched the project with \u201cthe climate crisis as a focus\u201d. The email said the company was the foundation\u2019s \u201ceco-friendly travel partner\u201d and more than $40,000 had been raised for the foundation by offering customers the option of an extra dollar cost on their tickets. Ridley told Guardian Australia the foundation was \u201cnot aware\u201d of Greyhound\u2019s contract with BMD. He said: \u201cWe have a clear ethical charter and for Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 it\u2019s critically important that we follow that charter. I need to look and check this immediately.\u201d Guardian Australia has also seen a report prepared by a public relations company advising Greyhound on how it should handle its association with BMD and the Adani mine. The report included the text of the email written by De Waal, saying \u201cGreyhound Australia must be conscious this update could be forwarded to activists and the media\u201d. The company\u2019s messages should have \u201cthree pillars\u201d that refer to supporting local employment, \u201cdelivering environmentally friendly and safe services\u201d and \u201csupporting regional communities\u201d, the report said. Several major companies associated with the controversial coalmine have been targeted by campaigners. Billie Tristram, 14, is a climate change campaigner who has helped organise school strike marches in Townsville. \u201cWe travel to school camps using Greyhound buses \u2013 a lot of schools use them. [Greyhound] is putting economics first instead of the environment. It\u2019s like a slap in the face. I won\u2019t be travelling with them until they back out.\u201d In January, the German technology company Siemens said it would honour its Adani contract after carrying out a review. In December, the engineering firm GHD ended a 10-year association with Adani after that company was also targeted by campaigners. Julien Vincent, the executive director of Market Forces, a group that tracks the relationships between corporations and fossil fuel industries, said Greyhound was now being placed on its \u201cAdani list\u201d of contractors associated with the mine. He said the company\u2019s email suggested it was aware of the \u201creputational risk\u201d of being associated with the project. \u201cThis is not to let any other fossil fuel projects off the hook, but we are drawing a line in the sand [on Adani].\u201d In a statement, Greyhound verified the email and its contents, and said its Greyhound Resources business had been operating for more than 10 years in Queensland\u2019s Bowen basin and in Gladstone. \u201cGreyhound\u2019s work in the resources sector reduces companies\u2019 overall carbon footprint,\u201d the statement said. The company said it had not yet been targeted by anti-Adani campaigners. \u201cWe want our team to be safe and secure while delivering a transport solution that takes light vehicles off the road and provides safe transfers for workers from towns and cities to camps and site.\u201d Asked if the company anticipated criticism from young people who used their services, the statement said: \u201cAll generations can make appropriate ethical choices in contributing to lessoning their carbon footprint on this planet. \u201cGreyhound is not only a comfortable and scenic way to travel, it is the most carbon efficient per person for long distances. We have younger customers choosing bus as a greener way to travel over planes, trains and automobiles.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison\u2019s senior ministers discussed how best to reposition the government\u2019s climate change policies in a cabinet meeting on Monday. After Morrison claimed that there were no members of his frontbench wanting stronger action on climate change policy, sources have told Guardian Australia that ministers discussed the issue at length in the cabinet meeting that followed in Canberra that day. Some cabinet ministers are understood to have expressed the view that there is a need for the government to step up action in a way that is both \u201cgenuine and believable\u201d in the year ahead. However, no one argued for any substantial policy change that strayed from the Coalition\u2019s election commitments, with senior members of the Coalition unified around the government\u2019s emissions reduction targets of 26% to 28% of 2005 levels by 2030. The potential of carryover credits not being used to meet the Paris target was also discussed in line with the government\u2019s changing public rhetoric that the credits would only be used \u201cif needed\u201d. It is understood that the cabinet discussion was focused on what more could be done in the area of climate change policy other than emissions reduction targets, including in the areas of transport, energy and fuel. The government has been talking up the importance of technologies such as hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, lithium production, biofuels and waste-to-energy as ways to reduce Australia\u2019s carbon footprint as it has sought to deflect criticism about its response to climate change. Morrison has been under mounting pressure to explain how he intends to \u201cevolve\u201d the government\u2019s climate change policies after he indicated the government would do more in the wake of the bushfire crisis. The prime minister has conceded the severity of the fire season is partly caused by climate change, but has sought to shift the focus to \u201cadaptation and resilience\u201d and a \u201cpractical\u201d response, rather than on emissions reduction measures. Speaking on Sky News on Tuesday night, Morrison said \u201chazard reduction is as important as emissions reduction, and many would argue more so because it has a direct practical impact\u201d, he said. He also flagged the possibility of new national standards that would report on how states were tracking on hazard reduction performance. Some Coalition MPs believe that the government can not win any political fight on climate change, and that no policy change is needed. There is particular concern among some conservatives about a possible shift to a net zero emissions target by 2050. The government has undertaken to look at shifting to a net zero by 2050 commitment through the Pacific Islands Forum, but Morrison said this week that \u201cpeople who make these commitments need to be able to tell people what it will cost them\u201d. \u201cWe need to understand what that means \u2013 I mean, people can say that, but what does that mean for jobs? Now I can\u2019t answer that question right now \u2026 But I\u2019m concerned it wouldn\u2019t be a good thing.\u201d But in a sign of the political challenge facing Morrison, moderate MPs in inner-city seats are at the same time pushing for more ambitious action, amid concern that climate change will be a hot button issue at the next election. On Tuesday, the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, talked up the government\u2019s \u201coverachievement\u201d for emissions reduction, saying the government\u2019s position was clear that Australia would only use carryover credits if needed. \u201cThe result of Australians overachieving on our 2012 targets and on our 2020 targets \u2026 means there is less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a result of the hard work of Australian families, households and businesses, and we believe that we should be given credit for that,\u201d Taylor told Sky News. \u201cWe are ahead of the game and our targets are a floor, not a cap, they are not a cap on our ambition and we will continue to work hard to meet and beat those targets by 2030.\u201d According to the latest government projections of Australia\u2019s emissions, Australia will only meet its 2030 target of reducing emissions by between 395m tonnes and 462m tonnes by relying on 411m tonnes of carryover credits. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said on Monday he wanted the government\u2019s \u201cambition\u201d to be achieving the emissions reduction targets without the need for carryover credits. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be the ambition in terms of the way in which we seek, as a government, to be able to reduce our emissions and reduce Australia\u2019s emissions into the future and applying all of those new technologies,\u201d Birmingham said. Morrison this week smacked down the New South Wales environment minister, Matt Kean, for suggesting federal Liberals were pushing the government to increase its ambition on emissions reduction and abandon the use of carryover credits. \u201cMatt Kean doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the federal cabinet [and] most of the federal cabinet wouldn\u2019t even know who Matt Kean was. \u201cWe are dealing with our climate policies in the same way as we took them to the election \u2026 we will meet and beat our emission reduction targets,\u201d Morrison said.",

      "bodyText": "Law firm Maurice Blackburn will on Wednesday launch a class action lawsuit against National Australia Bank for delaying the move of $6.3bn belonging to more than 330,000 super customers to low-fee accounts \u2013 a decision that allowed the big four bank\u2019s financial advisers to continue to reap lucrative fees. The lawsuit, to be filed in the Victorian supreme court, will accuse two NAB subsidiaries that acted as superannuation trustees, Nulis Nominees (Australia) and MLC Nominees, of failing in their duty to put fund members first when there was a conflict of interest. In his final report last February, the banking royal commissioner Kenneth Hayne found that the two companies \u201cprioritised the commercial interests of the NAB group or the interests of advisers, or more probably, both\u201d by dragging out the transfers. The new class action is the latest Hayne pain felt by the bank, which lost its chief executive, Andrew Thorburn, and chairman, the former treasury secretary Ken Henry, after the commissioner excoriated them in his report. Profit has slumped more than 10% because of the scandal and the bank has set aside more than $2bn to compensate customers it has ripped off. It has already settled one class action related to the royal commission, paying almost $50m in November to people who took out worthless credit card insurance. It also faces a series of lawsuits from the corporate regulator for charging fees without providing a service that includes one lodged just before Christmas that carries a theoretical maximum penalty running into the billions of dollars. Maurice Blackburn\u2019s class action covers customers who had super accounts with the MasterKey Business Super and Personal Super funds. Customers with money in the two funds originally paid a commission to financial advisers who organised the funds, but in 2012 this was replaced with a \u201cplan service fee\u201d of about the same size. About $33.8m was deducted from the accounts of 220,000 members who had no adviser to give them any service, and an additional $67m was taken from members who did have an adviser, Hayne found. Under reforms brought in by the Gillard government, NAB was required to move dormant accounts, called \u201caccrued default amounts\u201d or ADAs, to new low-cost MySuper accounts by a deadline of 1 July 2017. But, Hayne said, this was \u201cthe outer limit for compliance and does not take account of trustees\u2019 other obligations\u201d towards members. Other funds moved their customers earlier, he found. In evidence to the commission, NAB \u201cacknowledged that one of the consequences of the delay was that members paid higher fees for longer than they would have had their ADAs been transferred earlier\u201d, Hayne said. \u201cAdvisers, including advisers within the NAB group, stood to benefit from this to the financial detriment of those members.\u201d Maurice Blackburn\u2019s head of class actions, Andrew Watson, said the saga was \u201canother regrettable case of mismanagement in the superannuation sector\u201d. \u201cMySuper was introduced to protect the retirement outcomes of Australians,\u201d he said. \u201cMLC Nominees and Nulis\u2019s job was to move default member balances into MySuper at the time that best met their members\u2019 needs, not the needs of NAB or financial advisers.\u201d",

And that even in leave areas, the vast majority of our voters were remain. But, while it\u2019s true that the proportions are something like 70% to 30% nationally, in strong leave areas, as many as 40% to 50%-plus of Labour voters are leavers,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He and other sceptics about Labour\u2019s shift towards a referendum always felt it was fruitless to try to skirt the issue. \u201cIn the end, you can\u2019t just fight a battle and ignore your opponent. You can\u2019t just say: \u2018We\u2019re fighting at sea\u2019, if your opponent is mounting a land invasion,\u201d said one party strategist. </p> \n<p>Even Labour\u2019s attack line on the NHS \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/03/jeremy-corbyn-on-the-offensive-over-donald-trumps-plans-for-nhs\">focusing on the risk</a> that it would be handed to Donald Trump as part of a trade deal \u2013 had an anti-Brexit undertone to it. And focusing on austerity, which still featured heavily in Corbyn\u2019s stump speeches, was perhaps a less potent weapon against a Tory party that had ditched Philip Hammond\u2019s rigid fiscal discipline.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat was one of the things that we were a bit caught on the hop about: Boris suddenly started throwing austerity overboard. He had deprived us of our core message,\u201d said the adviser.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s approach to targeting was almost a mirror image of 2017\u2019s. Then, Corbyn and his lieutenants blamed the excessive caution of party officials for blunting their attacking edge.</p> \n<p>This time, they began with an ambitious list of 96 targets \u2013 66 of which were attacking seats, and 30 defensive.</p> \n<p>That was partly because the job of any opposition is to get into government, and it would have appeared defeatist to target fewer seats than Labour needed for a majority.</p> \n<p>But the campaign team also hoped some of the magic that propelled them to such a close result in 2017 would spark the campaign into life again: the rousing rallies, Corbyn\u2019s comfortable-in-his-own-skin authenticity, Tory missteps. \u201cWe were all too hypnotised by our achievement in 2017, and we thought that however bad the situation was, once the campaign got going we would catch up,\u201d said one party source.</p> \n<p>Some events \u2013 including an upbeat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/oct/31/this-general-election-is-not-about-me-jeremy-corbyn-video\">launch at Battersea Arts Centre</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/labour-manifesto-to-slap-11bn-tax-on-oil-and-gas-firms-to-fund-green-plan\">unveiling of the manifesto</a> at Birmingham City University, where Corbyn held the document triumphantly aloft against a dark pink backdrop \u2013 almost recaptured the buzz of two years earlier. But veterans of that election remarked that the crowds in 2019 were generally smaller this time, and failed to build as the weeks went on.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"24e26e95-41f8-4972-a832-e738993b5850\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SmBBpulqb3w?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Labour\u2019s manifesto itself was a casualty of the fractious working relationships that dogged the campaign. Milne was widely viewed internally as the most important single decision-maker in the 2017 campaign. But this time, a day before the crucial clause V meeting at which the manifesto was to be signed off, he had not seen the final printed version.</p> \n<p>Key policies had been thrashed out in discussions, including among the strategy group \u2013 but Fisher\u2019s policy team kept a firm hold on the finished document, and his relationship with Milne had been badly frayed by the Brexit battle.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo one really knew what was coming until it emerged, from a process only really accessible to Andrew Fisher and John McDonnell,\u201d said one Labour source. \u201cAnd so major policies were coming out \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/15/free-broadband-essential-uk-compete-john-mcdonnell-labour-policy-openreach\">free broadband</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/23/labour-fifty-eight-billion-pound-pledge-women-pension-age-trap\">Waspi women</a> \u2013 which really nobody knew was coming.\u201d But Labour\u2019s policy wonks insist they were just doing what they could to fill the hole where they felt an electoral strategy should have been. Unlike in 2017, policy and strategy were working in silos.</p> \n<p>The general election was Fisher\u2019s final job for Corbyn, after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/21/remain-mps-accuse-jeremy-corbyn-shutting-down-brexit-debate\">resigned in September</a>, with an email leaked to the Sunday Times in which he gave a blistering critique of Labour\u2019s incompetence, including what he called \u201ca blizzard of lies and excuses\u201d about the party\u2019s failure to come up with a strapline for its conference until the last minute.</p> \n<p>The same indecision dogged Labour\u2019s election slogan. \u201cIt\u2019s Time for Real Change\u201d was meant as a riposte to Johnson\u2019s phoney claim to be offering a fresh start for Britain, but was the outcome of a fraught debate, including external consultants and focus grouping, and as such was little loved by anyone.</p> \n<p>As the campaign went on, and anxiety increased at the risks Labour faced in defensive seats, \u201cLabour Is On Your Side\u201d took over \u2013 though one insider laments with hindsight that voters in leave seats who felt the party had betrayed them over Brexit appear to have been moved to respond with \u201cfuck off\u201d.</p> \n<p>The \u201cgrid\u201d, overseen by the combative Murphy, and discussed at a 10am daily meeting, was packed with policy announcements: but there was scant sense of a theme or direction for each week or phase of the campaign.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey had all these policies drafted and waiting, and that would lead the grid \u2013 a different policy announcement every day,\u201d said one member of the campaign team. \u201cI think it was pretty obvious that there was a lot of throwing a lot of stuff at a lot of walls and hoping it would stick.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e15e2305ee10e475eea4df671a28c05934b98f19\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e15e2305ee10e475eea4df671a28c05934b98f19/267_205_5709_3779/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corbyn gives a speech to supporters in Whitby, North Yorkshire.

On Tuesday, as the party prepared to launch its race and faith manifesto, the Times splashed with <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/labour-antisemitism-corbyn-not-fit-for-high-office-says-ephraim-mirvis-0thlclsns\">a letter</a> from the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, claiming Corbyn\u2019s handling of allegations of anti-Jewish racism <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/labour-has-let-poison-of-antisemitism-take-root-says-chief-rabbi\">meant he was \u201cunfit for high office\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>At the Bernie Grant Arts Centre in Tottenham that morning, Corbyn was more than half an hour late for the race and faith event, and the MP Dawn Butler filled the time by reciting the lyrics to the Labi Siffre classic (Something Inside) So Strong, to a bemused audience of hacks, who bombarded Labour aides with questions and requests. Until the last moment, it was unclear whether she and Corbyn would take questions from journalists.</p> \n<p>Later that day, the Labour leader recorded a pre-planned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/what-the-papers-say-about-jeremy-corbyns-interview-with-andrew-neil\">interview with Andrew Neil</a>. Corbyn was at his most petulant, as the broadcaster challenged him to apologise over antisemitism, grumpily interjecting \u201cwill you let me finish?\u201d \u2013 a clip of which found its way on to that week\u2019s Have I Got News for You.</p> \n<p>Colleagues say that throughout the campaign Corbyn was keener to be personally involved in day-to-day decisions than in 2017 \u2013 and grumpier, sometimes even angry if he felt his views had been disregarded.</p> \n<p>Labour tried to use a moment of political theatre to seize back the agenda the next day, by staging a press conference where Corbyn dramatically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/27/jeremy-corbyn-reveals-dossier-proving-nhs-up-for-sale\">held aloft a 400-plus page leaked dossier</a> suggesting the government was ready to put the NHS up for sale. \u201cThese uncensored documents leave Boris Johnson\u2019s denials in absolute tatters!\u201d he cried.</p> \n<p>But the impact was nothing like the furore in 2017 when Labour\u2019s manifesto was leaked \u2013 or when Theresa May insisted \u201cnothing has changed\u201d, after executing a swift U-turn on her social care policy. \u201cIt worked for a day, and we had a 36-hour row about whether Donald Trump was going to buy the NHS, but that was it,\u201d said one insider.</p> \n<p>And as the strategy group tried to hone Labour\u2019s message, focusing on a bread-and-butter offer to leavers, some began to fear Corbyn\u2019s straight-from-the-heart, unscripted authenticity was not the best medium for delivering it. \u201cIt\u2019s just Jeremy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said one exasperated member of the campaign team. \u201cYou judge him on a different marking scheme, almost. Did this person in this stump speech hit the five key messages to get on the evening news? No. Was he ever going to?

      "bodyText": "As Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s top aide, Seumas Milne, drove to Finsbury Park on election night to watch the exit poll with his boss in an anonymous office lent by a charity to skirt the media scrum, he took a call from the Scottish National party\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford. The genial Scottish MP wanted to prepare the ground for the two parties to enter into immediate talks, if the result was a hung parliament \u2013 but Milne told him there was no chance of that. After a bruising six-week campaign, he and Corbyn\u2019s lieutenants were resigned to humiliation at the hands of Boris Johnson. Labour\u2019s defeat was a long time in the making. Two years of parliamentary warfare over Brexit had left deep scars on the personal relationships that once formed the glue for Corbyn\u2019s radical political project. Speaking to many of the leading figures in Labour\u2019s election campaign, a picture emerges of tactical spats, mixed messages and frayed tempers \u2013 not least Corbyn\u2019s own. Many of the senior players were the same as in 2017 \u2013 the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, chaired the daily 7.30am calls to set the agenda for the day ahead; the policy chief, Andrew Fisher, oversaw the manifesto; the former Corbyn aide Karie Murphy led the operational side of the campaign, and Milne was in charge of strategy and communications. Jennie Formby, handpicked by Corbyn to be Labour\u2019s general secretary, oversaw management and budgets. Yet this group had been on different sides in the painful dispute about Labour\u2019s Brexit stance \u2013 McDonnell and Fisher were instrumental in helping to persuade Corbyn that backing a second referendum was the only way of safeguarding the leftwing political movement they had built. By contrast, Milne and Murphy \u2013 as well as the Unite union\u2019s chief of staff, Andrew Murray, and the Corbynite PR Steve Howell, both of whom sat on the election strategy group \u2013 believed that fateful decision would cost Labour dear in leave-supporting seats. And this difference of analysis continued to reverberate throughout the campaign. There was a strongly held perception in Labour\u2019s HQ at the outset that Labour still had more work to do to pacify remain voters, after its switch to backing a second referendum. As for leave voters, many of whom were heavily concentrated in a swath of Labour-held seats being targeted by the Tories, the plan was to change the subject \u2013 focusing as much as possible on other issues, including public services and the NHS. \u201cIt felt like the People\u2019s Vote campaign in there,\u201d said one senior member of the campaign team, who recalled being warned, in respect of Labour leave voters: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to prod the beast!\u201d Howell, who had overseen Labour\u2019s digital campaigning in 2017 and was brought in this time to look at targeting and polling, was alarmed by the prevalence of the view that Labour could win by focusing on remainers. \u201cA mythology developed \u2013 Paul Mason was one of the early advocates of it \u2013 that we could win an election on remain votes. And that even in leave areas, the vast majority of our voters were remain. But, while it\u2019s true that the proportions are something like 70% to 30% nationally, in strong leave areas, as many as 40% to 50%-plus of Labour voters are leavers,\u201d he said. He and other sceptics about Labour\u2019s shift towards a referendum always felt it was fruitless to try to skirt the issue. \u201cIn the end, you can\u2019t just fight a battle and ignore your opponent. You can\u2019t just say: \u2018We\u2019re fighting at sea\u2019, if your opponent is mounting a land invasion,\u201d said one party strategist. Even Labour\u2019s attack line on the NHS \u2013 focusing on the risk that it would be handed to Donald Trump as part of a trade deal \u2013 had an anti-Brexit undertone to it. And focusing on austerity, which still featured heavily in Corbyn\u2019s stump speeches, was perhaps a less potent weapon against a Tory party that had ditched Philip Hammond\u2019s rigid fiscal discipline. \u201cThat was one of the things that we were a bit caught on the hop about: Boris suddenly started throwing austerity overboard. He had deprived us of our core message,\u201d said the adviser. Labour\u2019s approach to targeting was almost a mirror image of 2017\u2019s. Then, Corbyn and his lieutenants blamed the excessive caution of party officials for blunting their attacking edge. This time, they began with an ambitious list of 96 targets \u2013 66 of which were attacking seats, and 30 defensive. That was partly because the job of any opposition is to get into government, and it would have appeared defeatist to target fewer seats than Labour needed for a majority. But the campaign team also hoped some of the magic that propelled them to such a close result in 2017 would spark the campaign into life again: the rousing rallies, Corbyn\u2019s comfortable-in-his-own-skin authenticity, Tory missteps. \u201cWe were all too hypnotised by our achievement in 2017, and we thought that however bad the situation was, once the campaign got going we would catch up,\u201d said one party source. Some events \u2013 including an upbeat launch at Battersea Arts Centre, and the unveiling of the manifesto at Birmingham City University, where Corbyn held the document triumphantly aloft against a dark pink backdrop \u2013 almost recaptured the buzz of two years earlier. But veterans of that election remarked that the crowds in 2019 were generally smaller this time, and failed to build as the weeks went on. Labour\u2019s manifesto itself was a casualty of the fractious working relationships that dogged the campaign. Milne was widely viewed internally as the most important single decision-maker in the 2017 campaign. But this time, a day before the crucial clause V meeting at which the manifesto was to be signed off, he had not seen the final printed version. Key policies had been thrashed out in discussions, including among the strategy group \u2013 but Fisher\u2019s policy team kept a firm hold on the finished document, and his relationship with Milne had been badly frayed by the Brexit battle. \u201cNo one really knew what was coming until it emerged, from a process only really accessible to Andrew Fisher and John McDonnell,\u201d said one Labour source. \u201cAnd so major policies were coming out \u2013 free broadband, Waspi women \u2013 which really nobody knew was coming.\u201d But Labour\u2019s policy wonks insist they were just doing what they could to fill the hole where they felt an electoral strategy should have been. Unlike in 2017, policy and strategy were working in silos. The general election was Fisher\u2019s final job for Corbyn, after he resigned in September, with an email leaked to the Sunday Times in which he gave a blistering critique of Labour\u2019s incompetence, including what he called \u201ca blizzard of lies and excuses\u201d about the party\u2019s failure to come up with a strapline for its conference until the last minute. The same indecision dogged Labour\u2019s election slogan. \u201cIt\u2019s Time for Real Change\u201d was meant as a riposte to Johnson\u2019s phoney claim to be offering a fresh start for Britain, but was the outcome of a fraught debate, including external consultants and focus grouping, and as such was little loved by anyone. As the campaign went on, and anxiety increased at the risks Labour faced in defensive seats, \u201cLabour Is On Your Side\u201d took over \u2013 though one insider laments with hindsight that voters in leave seats who felt the party had betrayed them over Brexit appear to have been moved to respond with \u201cfuck off\u201d. The \u201cgrid\u201d, overseen by the combative Murphy, and discussed at a 10am daily meeting, was packed with policy announcements: but there was scant sense of a theme or direction for each week or phase of the campaign. \u201cThey had all these policies drafted and waiting, and that would lead the grid \u2013 a different policy announcement every day,\u201d said one member of the campaign team. \u201cI think it was pretty obvious that there was a lot of throwing a lot of stuff at a lot of walls and hoping it would stick.\u201d As the campaign went on, and reports flooded into the Victoria HQ from anxious candidates in defensive seats, those who had always believed Brexit was Labour\u2019s overriding challenge felt increasingly vindicated \u2013 and alarmed. On Sunday 24 November, about halfway through, the strategy group met to review how things were going \u2013 and agreed it was necessary to make more of a pitch to leavers \u2013 and to resource defensive seats more generously. As a result, Howell recommended adding another 16 seats to the target list, and it was decided to ask Labour\u2019s regional directors for more recommendations \u2013 a process that resulted in a further 21 seats being put on the list, taking the total to more than 130, though not all of those were fully resourced. The group also decided to focus more on Labour\u2019s bread-and-butter offer to working-class voters in leave-supporting communities \u2013 including giveaways such as free prescriptions and social care \u2013 and to extend the party chairman Ian Lavery\u2019s campaigning Brexit bus tour. But in the event, much of the following week was overshadowed by Labour\u2019s record on tackling antisemitism. On Tuesday, as the party prepared to launch its race and faith manifesto, the Times splashed with a letter from the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, claiming Corbyn\u2019s handling of allegations of anti-Jewish racism meant he was \u201cunfit for high office\u201d. At the Bernie Grant Arts Centre in Tottenham that morning, Corbyn was more than half an hour late for the race and faith event, and the MP Dawn Butler filled the time by reciting the lyrics to the Labi Siffre classic (Something Inside) So Strong, to a bemused audience of hacks, who bombarded Labour aides with questions and requests. Until the last moment, it was unclear whether she and Corbyn would take questions from journalists. Later that day, the Labour leader recorded a pre-planned interview with Andrew Neil. Corbyn was at his most petulant, as the broadcaster challenged him to apologise over antisemitism, grumpily interjecting \u201cwill you let me finish?\u201d \u2013 a clip of which found its way on to that week\u2019s Have I Got News for You. Colleagues say that throughout the campaign Corbyn was keener to be personally involved in day-to-day decisions than in 2017 \u2013 and grumpier, sometimes even angry if he felt his views had been disregarded. Labour tried to use a moment of political theatre to seize back the agenda the next day, by staging a press conference where Corbyn dramatically held aloft a 400-plus page leaked dossier suggesting the government was ready to put the NHS up for sale. \u201cThese uncensored documents leave Boris Johnson\u2019s denials in absolute tatters!\u201d he cried. But the impact was nothing like the furore in 2017 when Labour\u2019s manifesto was leaked \u2013 or when Theresa May insisted \u201cnothing has changed\u201d, after executing a swift U-turn on her social care policy. \u201cIt worked for a day, and we had a 36-hour row about whether Donald Trump was going to buy the NHS, but that was it,\u201d said one insider. And as the strategy group tried to hone Labour\u2019s message, focusing on a bread-and-butter offer to leavers, some began to fear Corbyn\u2019s straight-from-the-heart, unscripted authenticity was not the best medium for delivering it. \u201cIt\u2019s just Jeremy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said one exasperated member of the campaign team. \u201cYou judge him on a different marking scheme, almost. Did this person in this stump speech hit the five key messages to get on the evening news? No. Was he ever going to? No. I went to rallies where there was a billboard and he didn\u2019t say what was on the fucking billboard. He just talked about whatever he wanted.\u201d As polling day loomed, some aides would have liked Corbyn to make more aggressive attacks on Johnson, whose loose relationship with the truth was openly laughed at by the Question Time audience when the pair met in a head-to-head debate. But \u201cno personal attacks\u201d was one of the rules written for Corbyn\u2019s 2015 leadership campaign by Fisher, and he stuck to it doggedly. The Labour leader told the Guardian at the outset of the campaign, \u201cthey go low, we go high\u201d \u2013 though one despairing party aide described it as \u201cthey go low, we go wandering across the country\u201d. After six gruelling weeks of criss-crossing the country, including a dawn rally in Glasgow on the final day of campaigning, Corbyn watched the grim exit poll with his wife, Laura, his fiercely loyal sons \u2013 who released a statement shortly afterwards lambasting the media for treating him badly \u2013 and a few officials, including Milne. They had been on a long journey together, from the political wilderness to the brink of government, but they believed their electoral chances had been crushed, in what one rueful Labour source called, \u201cthe Brexit vice\u201d. \u201cThis campaign was lost before it began,\u201d the source added. \u201cEven if nothing had gone wrong in terms of targeting, messaging, Jeremy\u2019s schedule, TV interviews, anything \u2013 I still think we would not have won.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Iran says its armed forces mistakenly launched two surface-to-air missiles at a Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed with 176 people onboard earlier this month, its first acknowledgement of the precise number of rounds fired at the airliner. Assessments by western intelligence agencies and video footage from the launch site had pointed to two missiles being fired at the Boeing 737-800 on the morning of 8 January, but Iranian officials had so far referenced only one until the release of preliminary report on Tuesday by the country\u2019s civil aviation authority. The black boxes recovered from the aircraft were still to be examined and could remain so for the time being, the report said. Iranian flight-crash investigators lacked the technology to download data from the aircraft\u2019s black boxes and had asked the US National Transportation Safety Board and its French counterpart for assistance, but neither had \u201cso far responded positively\u201d, it said. \u201cIf devices are provided, the information [on the boxes] can be restored and retrieved in a short period of time,\u201d the report said. Ukraine has made repeated requests for Iran to send the black boxes to Kyiv for analysis, which an Iranian aviation official was quoted agreeing to do on Saturday, before contradicting himself in remarks carried by state-run media outlets two days later. Canada, which lost 57 citizens onboard the flight, has called for France to handle the investigation. The report said Russian-made Tor-M1 missiles were launched at the Kyiv-bound Ukraine International Airlines jet shortly after it took off from Tehran at 6.12am local time. The aircraft last contact with air-traffic control at 8,100ft and disappeared from Iranian surveillance radars at 6.18am. After being struck, it descended over a residential area and crashed in a public park, tearing apart as it moved through a football pitch, farmlands and gardens and killing everyone onboard, investigators said. The report did not definitively blame the missiles for the crash, saying their impact \u201con the accident and the analysis of this action is under investigation\u201d. Footage from the site where the missiles were fired that was published on social media last week showed a 23-second gap between the two launches. The aerospace chief of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite, hardline branch of the Iranian military, said earlier this month a missile operator misidentified the plane as a cruise missile and had a 10-second window to decide whether to fire at the target. \u201cUnder such circumstances, he decides to make that bad decision: he engages, the missile is fired, and the plane is hit,\u201d Ali Hajizadeh said. Iranian air defences around the capital had been bolstered the previous night in anticipation of Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack on US forces stationed in neighbouring Iraq about five hours before the plane crashed on the same morning. Those missiles were fired in reprisal for the US\u2019s assassination five days earlier of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, the head of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 external operations and one of the country\u2019s most popular political figures. Iran had initially blamed the plane crash on a technical malfunction, but doubts over that explanation grew when Ukrainian officials said they were actively investigating the possibility the plane had been shot down. Photos purporting to be from the crash site also showed what appeared to be debris from a Tor-M1 missile. Officials admitted to accidentally shooting down the plane four days later, triggering protests in Tehran and other cities across the country and a wave of resignations and criticism from journalists at state-run outlets.",

It is now embedded in every aspect of our lives: our banks, high streets, television screens and football teams. When we talk about gambling, we enter a vast world that spans questions from addiction and isolation to market failure and machine learning. It is a world that stretches the limits of the relationship between freedom and the protection of the state. And, in the breakdown of that relationship, many people have been harmed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/PDF/survey-data/Gambling-participation-in-2018-behaviour-awareness-and-attitudes.pdf\" title=\"\">Research suggests</a> that there are just under half a million problem gamblers who have their lives damaged by debt, depression, family breakdown and, in the worst cases, suicide.</p> <p>The stories stack up. The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/16/betfred-owners-make-millions-from-company-treating-gambling-addicts\" title=\"\">recently showed</a> how one operator profits from a company that treats gambling addicts. Similar scandals have highlighted the industry use of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/02/it-keeps-you-coming-back-the-rise-of-vip-gambling-schemes\" title=\"\">VIP schemes</a>, and the fact that some FA Cup games have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/08/fa-cup-seven-uk-betting-companies-streaming-games\" title=\"\">exclusively streamed</a> via betting giants such as Bet365.</p> <p>These stories have led to outrage. Figures from John Simpson to Gary Lineker have joined the condemnation, with Lineker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garylineker/status/1214871285408382977\" title=\"\">calling</a> the Bet365 story \u201call kinds of wrong\u201d.</p> <p>Politically, the outrage has led to a cross-party consensus that it is time for change. Early voices in parliament for reform, such as Tom Watson, Tracey Crouch and Carolyn Harris, have been joined by a coterie of support from all sides, including the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, the prime minister\u2019s trade envoy Richard Graham and the SNP\u2019s Ronnie Cowan. There has also been a Lords inquiry into gambling, an all-party parliamentary group inquiry into gambling-related harm, and material published by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee. Echoing both the Labour party and campaigners, the government has just committed to a review of the 2005 Gambling Act.</p> <p>The last major gambling review was conducted in 2001 by Alan Budd, a founding member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. Budd worked on the premise that a balance could be struck between economic freedom and social protection. This was the right question to ask at the time, but since 2001 the world has experienced technological change that Budd could not have foreseen.</p> <p>A review of the 2005 act will require a Budd report fit for the digital age. It will face four big challenges.</p> <p>First is the question of its premise. Budd sought a balance between the freedom to gamble and protection from harm. Technological change is mentioned, but the report could not have foreseen the rise of smartphones and social media \u2013 let alone recent developments in data analytics and algorithmic intelligence. A new review must be based on a premise that incorporates the reality of machines as well as humans and the market. Today\u2019s gambling landscape is less about casinos and seaside piers and more about computer random number generators, <a href=\"https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/for-gambling-businesses/Compliance/Sector-specific-compliance/Betting/In-play-betting.aspx\" title=\"\">in-play betting</a> and hybrid, often predatory, online forms of product and marketing.</p> <p>Second is the question of scope. The 2005 act reads like a Victorian novel. It categorises and it promulgates, it espouses key concepts in subclauses. It is a hefty tome. There is an argument that new legislation should be leaner and agile enough to respond to innovation and change. In other words, a new review should be more novella than novel.</p> <p>Third is the question of time. The Budd report took over a year to write and was published in 2001. The act became law in 2005 and was fully implemented in 2007. The whole process took the best part of a decade. If the same happens now, then by the time a new act comes into effect, in 2027, the industry will have changed beyond recognition, with new products, new markets and new types of currency. It is important that a new review does not create a similar delay.</p> <p>Fourth is the question of scale.

      "bodyText": "Not a day goes by without another horror story about gambling. A familiar theme now dominates the front pages: for too long, the betting industry has encouraged excessive spending, exploited vulnerable people, and failed to tackle money laundering or protect its customers. Gambling has become a canary in the coalmine of our economy. It is now embedded in every aspect of our lives: our banks, high streets, television screens and football teams. When we talk about gambling, we enter a vast world that spans questions from addiction and isolation to market failure and machine learning. It is a world that stretches the limits of the relationship between freedom and the protection of the state. And, in the breakdown of that relationship, many people have been harmed. Research suggests that there are just under half a million problem gamblers who have their lives damaged by debt, depression, family breakdown and, in the worst cases, suicide. The stories stack up. The Guardian recently showed how one operator profits from a company that treats gambling addicts. Similar scandals have highlighted the industry use of VIP schemes, and the fact that some FA Cup games have been exclusively streamed via betting giants such as Bet365. These stories have led to outrage. Figures from John Simpson to Gary Lineker have joined the condemnation, with Lineker calling the Bet365 story \u201call kinds of wrong\u201d. Politically, the outrage has led to a cross-party consensus that it is time for change. Early voices in parliament for reform, such as Tom Watson, Tracey Crouch and Carolyn Harris, have been joined by a coterie of support from all sides, including the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, the prime minister\u2019s trade envoy Richard Graham and the SNP\u2019s Ronnie Cowan. There has also been a Lords inquiry into gambling, an all-party parliamentary group inquiry into gambling-related harm, and material published by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee. Echoing both the Labour party and campaigners, the government has just committed to a review of the 2005 Gambling Act. The last major gambling review was conducted in 2001 by Alan Budd, a founding member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. Budd worked on the premise that a balance could be struck between economic freedom and social protection. This was the right question to ask at the time, but since 2001 the world has experienced technological change that Budd could not have foreseen. A review of the 2005 act will require a Budd report fit for the digital age. It will face four big challenges. First is the question of its premise. Budd sought a balance between the freedom to gamble and protection from harm. Technological change is mentioned, but the report could not have foreseen the rise of smartphones and social media \u2013 let alone recent developments in data analytics and algorithmic intelligence. A new review must be based on a premise that incorporates the reality of machines as well as humans and the market. Today\u2019s gambling landscape is less about casinos and seaside piers and more about computer random number generators, in-play betting and hybrid, often predatory, online forms of product and marketing. Second is the question of scope. The 2005 act reads like a Victorian novel. It categorises and it promulgates, it espouses key concepts in subclauses. It is a hefty tome. There is an argument that new legislation should be leaner and agile enough to respond to innovation and change. In other words, a new review should be more novella than novel. Third is the question of time. The Budd report took over a year to write and was published in 2001. The act became law in 2005 and was fully implemented in 2007. The whole process took the best part of a decade. If the same happens now, then by the time a new act comes into effect, in 2027, the industry will have changed beyond recognition, with new products, new markets and new types of currency. It is important that a new review does not create a similar delay. Fourth is the question of scale. Because of the risks of scope and time, there is an argument that instead of One Single Big Act, a series of smaller interventions could be drafted around specific questions \u2013 not dissimilar to the approach taken in the shorter 2014 act on online gambling. The advantage to this approach would be that it ensures leanness and agility. The disadvantage would be that it risks being piecemeal. None of these four challenges will be easy to resolve. A new review will require someone of the stature and integrity of Alan Budd to lead it, and its success will depend on the quality of the relationship between the Department of Health, the Treasury and \u2013 if the rumours in Whitehall are true \u2013 whatever is about to replace DCMS. But if the government does get this balance right, then there is no reason why the horror stories of recent years cannot be transformed into a foundation for positive change, turn Britain\u2019s regulation of gambling into an example to the world \u2013 and allow us to redefine what we mean by gambling in the 21st century. \u2022 James Noyes is a former adviser to Tom Watson and fellow of the Social Market Foundation \u2022 Free help and advice about problem gambling is available online at BeGambleAware.org or by calling the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133",

Perhaps these observations, rather than a disregard for scientific evidence, are the basis of the latest polygraph rollout. Prof Thomas Ormerod, a polygraph expert at the University of Sussex, said: \u201cThe use of lie detector tests in this context will, at best, be a waste of police resources, and at worst will exacerbate problems associated with terrorism. Their use will give the public false confidence that they are being protected, while for terrorists who take and pass the tests, it gives them a free pass out of the legal system and cover to carry out attacks unimpeded. Moreover, for genuinely reformed offenders or innocent people implicated in terrorist activity, use of a technique that cannot be used in UK courts as admissible evidence will likely appear discriminatory.\u201d \u201cIt seems a missed opportunity that the UK government is failing to use the research results it has contributed to funding, preferring instead to rely on techniques that seem to offer a magic technology but in fact are deeply flawed and potentially dangerous.\u201d",

Rather, it is meant to be a preparatory process that could lead the European council (the leaders of the 27 governments) to initiate them. Crucially, however, this time the conference is supposed to be \u201ca bottom-up exercise where European citizens are listened to and their voices contribute to the debates on the future of Europe\u201d.</p> <p>Yet, when measured against this ambition, the plans for this exercise in democratic renewal, published by the European parliament last week, disappoint everyone but the three bodies that already run the EU. The council, the commission and the parliament are currently fighting to be in the conference\u2019s driving seat. Indeed, none of the proposed governance bodies foresees the participation of citizens or \u2013 shockingly \u2013 civil society organisations, other than European trade unions and the employers\u2019 organisation BusinessEurope. With a contingent of 135 MEPs out of a total membership of 200, the European parliament is set to dominate the conference plenary. So will the self-proclaimed most bottom-up experiment in EU democracy go down in history as one of the most top-down?</p> <p>The choice of former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt as a chair of the conference is certainly a tactical blunder. It smacks more of a consolation prize for the veteran arch-federalist \u2013 who previously failed to get an EU top job \u2013 than a thoughtful, consensual and timely choice. A Verhofstadt-led conference risks being perceived as a pro-EU hijack and could well alienate anti-Europeans and EU sceptics who now represent a quarter of seats in the European parliament and thus have a role in shaping Europe\u2019s political reality. Verhofstadt is a committed European but paradoxically could contribute to undermining the conference\u2019s legitimacy and its ability to reimagine Europe\u2019s future.</p> <p>The only participatory dimension comes from <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/B-9-2020-0036_EN.html\" title=\"\">six citizens\u2019 assemblies</a> \u2013 or agoras \u2013 which will deliberate throughout the conference process on a set of predefined policy areas, from the climate crisis the digital revolution to the redrafting of EU electoral law. Each agora will be made up of between 200 and 300 participants, randomly selected, demographically stratified (to ensure they are a microcosm of the wider population) who will peripatetically meet across the EU.</p> <p>While such an attempt at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/20/citizens-assembly-brexit-article-50-britain\" title=\"\">involving citizens</a> is long overdue in the EU and must be praised, it remains unclear how the agoras will actually be run and moderated, and, more importantly, how their conclusions will feed into the work and final conclusions of the conference. Will the agoras be useful sounding boards for the main event, or a cosmetic add-on imposed by the growing participatory zeitgeist?</p> <p>Besides the methodological vagueness and doubtful contribution to the eventual outcome of the conference, the agoras are not expected to play any agenda-setting role either. Thus, by being left out of the business of choosing themes to be debated, the citizens\u2019 agoras risk being the decorative cherry on top of a very Brussels-baked cake.</p> <p>The three big EU institutions should go back to the drawing board and come up with a more meaningful, sophisticated format aimed at capturing the unprecedented vivacity and readiness of EU civil society to engage with the union. The EU needs to move away from ad hoc and one-off participatory processes that are designed as quick, often patronising fixes for the original democratic deficit of the union.</p> <p>Why doesn\u2019t it learn from \u2013 and capitalise on \u2013 the countless democratic innovations already taking shape across the continent, from the <a href=\"https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitutional_convention.html\" title=\"\">Irish citizens\u2019 Constitutional Convention</a>, which reviewed the constitution, to the <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/files/10-17-19_Chwalisz_Deliberative.pdf\" title=\"\">Ostbelgien Citizens\u2019 Council</a> in the German-speaking community in eastern Belgium \u2013 a permanent mechanism and the first of its kind, letting randomly chosen ordinary citizens take part with parliamentarians in developing recommendations for the local parliament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/20/europe-responsible-brexit-eu-uk\">It\u2019s not just British leavers \u2013 the rest of Europe is responsible for Brexit, too | Eric Jozsef</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ultimate success of Von der Leyen\u2019s conference will be defined by its ability to devise a mechanism that is capable of capturing the most relevant of citizens\u2019 proposals and turning that into a permanent channel to feed into EU decision-making. Existing channels, from public consultations and petitions to complaints to the <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/149/european-citizens-initiative\" title=\"\">European Citizens Initiative</a> (ECI), are not intended to have a direct impact on the decision-making process. Worse, while unknown to most EU citizens they are overused by corporate lobbyists. The challenge is to be able to gauge the strength of the often chaotic popular demand for direct involvement and to accommodate it within the EU\u2019s rigid institutional framework.</p> <p>Europe will not find its democratic soul in a large-scale, standalone and pre-cooked exercise. It should instead set up an accessible, permanent and safe space in which citizens, from all corners of Europe, can regularly engage with EU decision-making. This is the only way that the EU will overcome its own chronic democratic malaise. It could in turn foster a Europe-wide debate on matters of common interest, shape policymaking and lead to more helpful electoral conversations.</p> <p>\u2022 Alberto Alemanno is a professor of EU law at HEC Paris</p>",

Indeed, none of the proposed governance bodies foresees the participation of citizens or \u2013 shockingly \u2013 civil society organisations, other than European trade unions and the employers\u2019 organisation BusinessEurope. With a contingent of 135 MEPs out of a total membership of 200, the European parliament is set to dominate the conference plenary. So will the self-proclaimed most bottom-up experiment in EU democracy go down in history as one of the most top-down? The choice of former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt as a chair of the conference is certainly a tactical blunder. It smacks more of a consolation prize for the veteran arch-federalist \u2013 who previously failed to get an EU top job \u2013 than a thoughtful, consensual and timely choice. A Verhofstadt-led conference risks being perceived as a pro-EU hijack and could well alienate anti-Europeans and EU sceptics who now represent a quarter of seats in the European parliament and thus have a role in shaping Europe\u2019s political reality. Verhofstadt is a committed European but paradoxically could contribute to undermining the conference\u2019s legitimacy and its ability to reimagine Europe\u2019s future. The only participatory dimension comes from six citizens\u2019 assemblies \u2013 or agoras \u2013 which will deliberate throughout the conference process on a set of predefined policy areas, from the climate crisis the digital revolution to the redrafting of EU electoral law. Each agora will be made up of between 200 and 300 participants, randomly selected, demographically stratified (to ensure they are a microcosm of the wider population) who will peripatetically meet across the EU. While such an attempt at involving citizens is long overdue in the EU and must be praised, it remains unclear how the agoras will actually be run and moderated, and, more importantly, how their conclusions will feed into the work and final conclusions of the conference. Will the agoras be useful sounding boards for the main event, or a cosmetic add-on imposed by the growing participatory zeitgeist? Besides the methodological vagueness and doubtful contribution to the eventual outcome of the conference, the agoras are not expected to play any agenda-setting role either. Thus, by being left out of the business of choosing themes to be debated, the citizens\u2019 agoras risk being the decorative cherry on top of a very Brussels-baked cake. The three big EU institutions should go back to the drawing board and come up with a more meaningful, sophisticated format aimed at capturing the unprecedented vivacity and readiness of EU civil society to engage with the union. The EU needs to move away from ad hoc and one-off participatory processes that are designed as quick, often patronising fixes for the original democratic deficit of the union. Why doesn\u2019t it learn from \u2013 and capitalise on \u2013 the countless democratic innovations already taking shape across the continent, from the Irish citizens\u2019 Constitutional Convention, which reviewed the constitution, to the Ostbelgien Citizens\u2019 Council in the German-speaking community in eastern Belgium \u2013 a permanent mechanism and the first of its kind, letting randomly chosen ordinary citizens take part with parliamentarians in developing recommendations for the local parliament. The ultimate success of Von der Leyen\u2019s conference will be defined by its ability to devise a mechanism that is capable of capturing the most relevant of citizens\u2019 proposals and turning that into a permanent channel to feed into EU decision-making. Existing channels, from public consultations and petitions to complaints to the European Citizens Initiative (ECI), are not intended to have a direct impact on the decision-making process. Worse, while unknown to most EU citizens they are overused by corporate lobbyists. The challenge is to be able to gauge the strength of the often chaotic popular demand for direct involvement and to accommodate it within the EU\u2019s rigid institutional framework. Europe will not find its democratic soul in a large-scale, standalone and pre-cooked exercise. It should instead set up an accessible, permanent and safe space in which citizens, from all corners of Europe, can regularly engage with EU decision-making. This is the only way that the EU will overcome its own chronic democratic malaise. It could in turn foster a Europe-wide debate on matters of common interest, shape policymaking and lead to more helpful electoral conversations. \u2022 Alberto Alemanno is a professor of EU law at HEC Paris",

There is so much stuff out there to binge-watch it\u2019s impossible to keep up with everything, and that opens the door to an insidious argument that streaming services could now take care of providing the fun stuff while a skeletal BBC does earnest good works in the background.

      "bodyText": "The BBC is a public good. It\u2019s a mark of the existential danger the corporation is now in that this statement has become controversial; that the home of David Attenborough and Panorama, of Blue Peter and In the Night Garden and groundbreaking drama and comedy, from Cathy Come Home to Fleabag, is now so friendless. Barely anyone has a good word to say for the poor old Beeb, consumed as it is by accusations of supposed political bias against every political faction going; which is why whoever succeeds the outgoing director general, Tony Hall, has their work cut out. But it\u2019s a public good all the same, and one we will regret letting slip through our fingers. I am not here to argue that the BBC gets nothing wrong. Like every organisation on the planet, it employs humans who make mistakes, some serious. It\u2019s been slow to respond to everything from equal pay claims to the risks of its journalists using social media to express personal opinions; it has rushed to break stories that haven\u2019t been thoroughly fact-checked. But every pointless row over whether Newsnight maliciously made Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s hat look more Russian, every accidental cockup blown up into a scandal by social media partisans, must be almost as welcome in Downing Street as among the BBC\u2019s commercial rivals. The more the spotlight falls on the programmes that divide viewers, not the ones everyone loves, the better; the more discredited the BBC, the more easily it can be thrown to the vultures. It\u2019s not news that some Conservatives have longed to break up the BBC for decades; but what\u2019s often missed is that this is as much about business as pleasure. All governments gripe about news coverage, but what energises Tories in particular is a profound ideological belief in the merits of private over public and a conviction that the BBC is abusing its monopoly to hold the private sector back. The siren voices here aren\u2019t ministers moaning that Andrew Neil was mean to them, but lobbyists for Apple and Amazon, Sky and Netflix, who would love to knock a powerful competitor out of the market. Imagine how much easier their life would become if the BBC could somehow be confined to the worthy stuff that doesn\u2019t make money, like local radio or educational children\u2019s programming, or if even part of the licence fee were split between rival providers. The likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime have established themselves in a crowded market by throwing vast amounts of cash at content, and so far viewers have been the winners from a golden era of telly. There is so much stuff out there to binge-watch it\u2019s impossible to keep up with everything, and that opens the door to an insidious argument that streaming services could now take care of providing the fun stuff while a skeletal BBC does earnest good works in the background. Expect to hear more Tories arguing, as the 2022 licence fee review grows nearer, that it\u2019s unfair to make viewers pay a compulsory fee for content they might not even watch, plus voluntary subscriptions for channels they might prefer. Why not just let viewers decide what they want to pay for? Don\u2019t be surprised to see this free-market argument couched as a consumer-friendly bid to cut household bills. Yet it\u2019s the safety net of public funding that lets the BBC take risks creatively \u2013 bringing on new screenwriters, say, or showcasing new music \u2013 and commercially, cross-subsidising current affairs programmes that everyone thinks are important but relatively few actually watch compared with, say, Strictly Come Dancing. Let its commercial rivals pick away at the popular bits and the BBC would emerge a horribly shrivelled thing, losing the authority and reach a national public service broadcaster should enjoy. There\u2019s no guarantee, meanwhile, that streaming services will keep churning out the high-quality drama they\u2019re currently offering, in effect as loss leaders. The Amazon model was always to spend big and make losses upfront in order to achieve dominance.

The works start from the 1930s and go through to the early 2000s with a special highlight on craft materials, which women have largely brought into the mainstream art world.</p> <p>The exhibition includes works by Louise Bourgeois, Helen Frankenthaler, Betye Saar and Carolee Schneemann, among others \u2013 including some anonymous artists.

Last fall, the Brooklyn Museum received a gift from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/nov/21/souls-grown-deep-the-foundation-helping-to-preserve-black-artists\">Souls Grown Deep Foundation</a>, an Atlanta-based collection boasting more than 1,000 works of African American art from the south.

The exhibit also features a 1978 painting by Joan Snyder, whose neo-expressionist artworks were largely overlooked in a time when male painters were celebrated. The same can be said of Frankenthaler, who is also featured in this exhibition.</p> <p>What is coincidental, is that a feminist artwork is the destination piece for the museum.

      "bodyText": "Like most museums, the Brooklyn Museum keeps much of its art collection in storage. For this particular institution, this includes a large amount of work from women which has been collecting dust, until now. A new exhibition featuring some of this rarely seen, sometimes never seen, work from women will be on view from 24 January, called Out of Place: A Feminist Look at the Collection. More than 60 artworks from 44 artists will be on display, featuring work that has traditionally been viewed as \u201cout of place\u201d in major museums. The works start from the 1930s and go through to the early 2000s with a special highlight on craft materials, which women have largely brought into the mainstream art world. The exhibition includes works by Louise Bourgeois, Helen Frankenthaler, Betye Saar and Carolee Schneemann, among others \u2013 including some anonymous artists. Hot off the heels of this weekend\u2019s Women\u2019s March, it\u2019s certainly timely. \u201cWe live in a historic moment where there is questioning and critique of institutions and where they originated, their founding principles and civic history,\u201d said Catherine Morris, who co-curated the exhibition with Carmen Hermo in the museum\u2019s Elizabeth A Sackler Center for Feminist Art. \u201cWhat does it mean to look at the world through a feminist lens?\u201d asks Morris. \u201cHow has this political movement impacted the world and how we understand what we look at?\u201d The idea for this exhibition started last year, after the success of their other feminist-centered exhibition Half the Picture: A Feminist Look at the Collection. Last fall, the Brooklyn Museum received a gift from the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, an Atlanta-based collection boasting more than 1,000 works of African American art from the south. Among the works in the donation is an anonymous cotton and wool quilt from 1890, in patterned abstract stripes of blue, red, black and white. \u201cQuestioning who is part of an institutional history, and who is deciding on what\u2019s having an impact on cultural institutions, which have been out of place, is something,\u201d said Morris. \u201cSo, there\u2019s lots of things that that can mean, and how it can impact culture.\u201d The exhibition is divided into three sections: the role of museums and galleries, artwork made outside of the mainstream and the domestic world\u2019s connection to feminism. There\u2019s a painting by the Colombian artist Gala Porras-Kim featuring 13 different dog breeds, as well as paintings by the New York artist Polly Apfelbaum, which imagines Snow White\u2019s seven dwarves without her. There is also a piece by Saar, Liberation of Aunt Jemima: Cocktail, from 1973, and an untitled portrait by May Wilson, an albumen silver print photo covered in glitter and paint. The exhibit also features a 1978 painting by Joan Snyder, whose neo-expressionist artworks were largely overlooked in a time when male painters were celebrated. The same can be said of Frankenthaler, who is also featured in this exhibition. What is coincidental, is that a feminist artwork is the destination piece for the museum. The main artwork crowning the fourth floor is Judy Chicago\u2019s 1979 sculpture, The Dinner Party, which has been seen by more than 1.5 million people, and is often referred to as the most famous feminist artwork of all time. It\u2019s also symbolic of this exhibition, being \u201cout of place\u201d. \u201cWhen Judy made it, it was not accepted by the mainstream art world. When it came out, it was vehemently rejected,\u201d said Morris. \u201cIt lifts craft-based materials to the same important level as oil painting, that\u2019s part of the dialogue that feminism brought very early to the conversation of what is valuable, and what is art.\u201d A large percentage of the works on view have never been shown before or are new to the collection. \u201cWe are \u2018shopping our own closet\u2019, so to speak,\u201d said Morris. \u201cAs a curator, that\u2019s what you\u2019re always looking for, you\u2019re energized by contemporary concern.\u201d One of the rarest works on view is a sculpture by Mary Frank, which has been hiding in the collection for decades. \u201cIt\u2019s on view now for the first time in literally decades,\u201d said Morris. A carving by Tonnie Jones is going on view for the first time, a photo series of Schneemann alongside her cats, and works by Stella Waitzkin, who was a longtime resident of the Chelsea hotel in New York City. \u201cShe devoted herself to this idiosyncratic project of making sculptural objects out of books,\u201d said Morris. \u201cSuddenly, to me, certain objects look really pertinent to this moment, like these artworks.\u201d With the onslaught of political art expected to hit museums and galleries ahead of the presidential election in November, and the Feminist Art Coalition\u2019s countrywide takeover of art exhibitions in museums and institutions in 2020, this is just a sign of what\u2019s to come this year. This exhibition also falls ahead of the centennial of the 19th amendment, women\u2019s constitutional right to vote. Institutional critique is a large part of the show. \u201cHow an artwork gets incorporated into the larger art world dialogue, and what happens when it does, or doesn\u2019t, is part of this,\u201d said Morris. \u201cWere the artists part of the original vision of what would be collected, and how has that changed?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhen someone is told they\u2019re \u2018out of place\u2019, it\u2019s a way for them to be put in their place. That\u2019s what brought us to this project.\u201d Out of Place: A Feminist Look at the Collection will be showing at Brooklyn Museum from 24 January to 13 September",

      "bodyText": "EasyJet said it was on course for a strong winter, after reporting a leap in revenues for the last quarter of 2019, partly boosted by the demise of Thomas Cook. Passenger numbers grew by 2.8% year on year, despite widespread disruption from strikes in France during which 871 flights were cancelled between October and December. The airline said that robust demand and slow capacity growth, with only 1% more seats flown, contributed to an increase in revenue per seat of almost 8.8%. It ascribed about one-fifth of that growth to the collapse of rival Thomas Cook last September. While it traditionally struggles to make money through the winter months, easyJet said it was on target for losses \u201cbetter than 2019\u201d in the first half of the financial year, despite an increased fuel bill. Johan Lundgren, easyJet chief executive, said the airline had \u201cmade a strong start to the year with continued positive momentum\u201d. EasyJet shares rose 4%, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100 on Tuesday. The results were met with relative approval by the company\u2019s founder and main shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, previously a thorn in the side of the airline\u2019s management.

Adults are not getting turned on to alcohol in the dairy aisle and, unless you are one of those saintly parents who never drinks around their children, then, you might argue, we as much as major food manufacturers are all culpable of normalising alcohol for the next generation.</p> <p>It seems strange, moreover, to single-out yoghurt as a gateway drug for impressionable teens when, from G&amp;T crisps and chocolate, or Joe &amp; Seph\u2019s gin and tonic popcorn to Jude\u2019s gin and tonic ice-cream, there are so many other gin and alcohol-flavoured products available which, intuitively, would appear more tempting to kids.

      "bodyText": "Fulfilling its PR team\u2019s wildest dreams, M\u00fcller finds itself in a spot of bother over the launch of two new gin and tonic flavoured yoghurts. Despite its G&amp;T, pink gin and elderflower pots containing less than 0.5% alcohol (effectively, alcohol-free), there has been hot debate online between those decrying this as reckless normalisation of alcohol and those polishing their \u201cgetting M\u00fcllered\u201d puns. One Yorkshire GP, Dr Nigel Wells, told the BBC that, particularly in Dry January: \u201cGiven the problems we have with alcohol as a society \u2013 very visible in our GP practices and A&amp;E departments \u2013 the creation of alcohol-inspired yoghurts seems unnecessary and counterproductive to public health.\u201d But is it? Adults are not getting turned on to alcohol in the dairy aisle and, unless you are one of those saintly parents who never drinks around their children, then, you might argue, we as much as major food manufacturers are all culpable of normalising alcohol for the next generation. It seems strange, moreover, to single-out yoghurt as a gateway drug for impressionable teens when, from G&amp;T crisps and chocolate, or Joe &amp; Seph\u2019s gin and tonic popcorn to Jude\u2019s gin and tonic ice-cream, there are so many other gin and alcohol-flavoured products available which, intuitively, would appear more tempting to kids. And yet which, current evidence suggests, remain far less exciting to them than, well, cheap alcohol. Instead, is the real controversy here the wanton misuse of a great spirit? Not only are firms flavouring gin with anything these days (elephant dung, brussels sprouts, rhubarb), they are also deploying gin\u2019s flavours in myriad foods. \u201cThe world has gone mad,\u201d says Jack Wakelin, manager at Sheffield cocktail bar, Public. \u201cThe best thing about gin is picking out its different botanicals. If you distilled cream or yoghurt as one of those it would probably add nice depth, sweetness and texture. But I can\u2019t say gin would be best enjoyed in yoghurt.\u201d Nonetheless, expect more gin-food mashups. Gin sales topped a record \u00a33bn last year. Everyone wants a piece of that gin-craze action.",

The commitment comes as lenders face heightened criticism over their role in fuelling the climate crisis by funding projects and companies that rely heavily on fossil fuels. Lloyds did not go into detail about how it would achieve that goal over the next decade, but said it would start by creating \u201cgreen products and services\u201d that would make it easier for customers to make lifestyle changes aimed at tackling the climate emergency. Lloyds, which is the UK\u2019s largest domestic bank with 26 million customers, is designing a green mortgage that will lend money to customers looking to improve the energy efficiency of their homes and developing a way for customers to compare the carbon impact of vehicles before they buy. The bank will also continue to offer discounted loans to businesses if those funds are aimed at reducing their environmental impact. While Lloyds was not able to confirm the current value of its carbon-linked loans, climate campaign groups including ShareAction and Greenpeace welcomed the commitment and called for other lenders to follow suit. Christian Wilson, senior research officer at ShareAction, said: \u201cParis [agreement] alignment needs emissions to be cut by 50% by 2030 so this is a great ambition by Lloyds. \u201cWhile other European banks have committed to align parts of their energy portfolio with a 1.5C scenario, Lloyds is the first to apply an explicit 1.5C-aligned target to its loan book. However, as always, the devil is in the detail. We need to see how this is implemented in practice and how this impacts lending to carbon-intensive sectors.\u201d Global emissions must fall by 7.6% every year from now until 2030 to stay within the 1.5C ceiling on temperature rises that scientists say is necessary to avoid disastrous consequences. Greenpeace this week shamed some of Lloyds\u2019 rivals including Barclays, which it says is among the top 10 global banks providing $1tn (\u00a3766bn) of the financial support for fossil fuel firms. Barclays is also being urged to stop offering loans to fossil fuel companies as part of the first ever shareholder climate resolution aimed at a UK bank.

Johnson sustained his injury seven weeks to the day before the opening afternoon of the 2020 Festival on 10 March, while the Professional Jockeys\u2019 Association lists the average recovery time from a broken arm as 62 days. However, trainer Philip Hobbs, who retains Johnson as his stable jockey, said that the rider hopes to return to action in \u201ca month or so\u201d. \u201cHe has broken his right arm in between the elbow and the hand,\u201d Hobbs said. \u201cHe is going to have an operation on it, to have it plated either today or tomorrow. He expects to be off for a month or so. He sounded very positive about Cheltenham.\u201d Despite Johnson\u2019s confidence, he is clearly in a race against time to be fully fit for National Hunt\u2019s showpiece event.

      "body": "<p>In a change of tactics in the bitter dispute over pension reform in France, hardline union leaders have cut power supplies and plunged tens of thousands of people into darkness.</p> <p>On Tuesday, just 24 hours after public transport drivers returned to work after six weeks of strikes and disruption, militant union federations showed their determination to continue their battle to force the government to back down over its proposed law.</p> <p>French energy workers cut electricity supplies to a swathe of the suburbs south of Paris, including to Orly airport and the city\u2019s fresh food market. Between 30,000 and 35,000 people were reported to have been affected.</p> <p>Members of the hardline CGT union\u2019s branches said the action was targeted to \u201chave an impact on the economy and above all make ourselves heard\u201d.</p> <p>Franck Jouanno, a CGT-\u00c9nergie representative, told French media: \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world to have a power cut. In general it doesn\u2019t last more than a morning.\u201d</p> <p>Orly, which has its own generators, was unaffected by the early morning power outages, but the airport\u2019s Orlyval automated train network was hit. A spokesperson for Rungis international market said emergency power kicked in when the power outage began and there was no disruption to trade.</p> <p>Energy company Enedis said it would be taking legal action over what it called \u201can act of spite\u201d. Julien Denormandie, a city and housing minister, described the action as \u201cscandalous and irresponsible\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCan you imagine, not only the inconvenience, but that people were put at risk? It\u2019s scandalous, it\u2019s irresponsible and it destroys dialogue [between parties],\u201d Denormandie told BFMTV.</p> <p>The power cuts affected several suburban towns from around 6am. S\u00e9bastien Menesplier, a CGT representative, said there were 30,000 workers on strike in the energy sector and the aim was to \u201ctake the mobilisation up a notch\u201d.</p> <p>CGT members also briefly cut electricity supplies at the Paris headquarters of the moderate CFDT, France\u2019s biggest union, which has voted to halt strikes and protests after the government made concessions in the pension reforms. Its decision has infuriated members of the CGT who want proposed changes to pensions entirely withdrawn and has pledged to continue industrial action.</p> <p>CGT militants forced their way into the CFTD offices on Friday, where they were accused of \u201cverbally and physically attacking\u201d union staff.</p> <p>CGT-\u00c9nergie admitted it was responsible for the power cuts. Union officials said they had cut the electricity to the Rungis, the wholesale fresh food market, and to Orly airport, plunging them \u201cinto darkness\u201d for between 90 minutes and two hours.</p> <p>\u201cRight now all we\u2019re hearing about in the media are the actions of the RATP [Paris transport company] and SNCF [national rail network],\u201d Jouanno said.</p> <p>Prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe told the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale the sudden power cuts were not compatible with \u201cdemocracy or the law\u201d and criticised the hit-and-run attacks on the CFDT headquarters, which he said was a \u201cprivate place\u201d . \u201cAll of this must be punished because it is not acceptable,\u201d Philippe said.</p> <p>Most striking public transport staff who had been engaged in six weeks of protests and industrial action since early December \u2013 against plans by Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist government to create a single points-based national pension scheme to replace the 42 existing schemes \u2013 returned to work on Monday.</p> <p>The industrial action brought the French capital to a standstill and disrupted train and other public services in the rest of France.

      "bodyText": "In a change of tactics in the bitter dispute over pension reform in France, hardline union leaders have cut power supplies and plunged tens of thousands of people into darkness. On Tuesday, just 24 hours after public transport drivers returned to work after six weeks of strikes and disruption, militant union federations showed their determination to continue their battle to force the government to back down over its proposed law. French energy workers cut electricity supplies to a swathe of the suburbs south of Paris, including to Orly airport and the city\u2019s fresh food market. Between 30,000 and 35,000 people were reported to have been affected. Members of the hardline CGT union\u2019s branches said the action was targeted to \u201chave an impact on the economy and above all make ourselves heard\u201d. Franck Jouanno, a CGT-\u00c9nergie representative, told French media: \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world to have a power cut. In general it doesn\u2019t last more than a morning.\u201d Orly, which has its own generators, was unaffected by the early morning power outages, but the airport\u2019s Orlyval automated train network was hit. A spokesperson for Rungis international market said emergency power kicked in when the power outage began and there was no disruption to trade. Energy company Enedis said it would be taking legal action over what it called \u201can act of spite\u201d. Julien Denormandie, a city and housing minister, described the action as \u201cscandalous and irresponsible\u201d. \u201cCan you imagine, not only the inconvenience, but that people were put at risk? It\u2019s scandalous, it\u2019s irresponsible and it destroys dialogue [between parties],\u201d Denormandie told BFMTV. The power cuts affected several suburban towns from around 6am. S\u00e9bastien Menesplier, a CGT representative, said there were 30,000 workers on strike in the energy sector and the aim was to \u201ctake the mobilisation up a notch\u201d. CGT members also briefly cut electricity supplies at the Paris headquarters of the moderate CFDT, France\u2019s biggest union, which has voted to halt strikes and protests after the government made concessions in the pension reforms. Its decision has infuriated members of the CGT who want proposed changes to pensions entirely withdrawn and has pledged to continue industrial action. CGT militants forced their way into the CFTD offices on Friday, where they were accused of \u201cverbally and physically attacking\u201d union staff. CGT-\u00c9nergie admitted it was responsible for the power cuts. Union officials said they had cut the electricity to the Rungis, the wholesale fresh food market, and to Orly airport, plunging them \u201cinto darkness\u201d for between 90 minutes and two hours. \u201cRight now all we\u2019re hearing about in the media are the actions of the RATP [Paris transport company] and SNCF [national rail network],\u201d Jouanno said. Prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe told the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale the sudden power cuts were not compatible with \u201cdemocracy or the law\u201d and criticised the hit-and-run attacks on the CFDT headquarters, which he said was a \u201cprivate place\u201d . \u201cAll of this must be punished because it is not acceptable,\u201d Philippe said. Most striking public transport staff who had been engaged in six weeks of protests and industrial action since early December \u2013 against plans by Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist government to create a single points-based national pension scheme to replace the 42 existing schemes \u2013 returned to work on Monday. The industrial action brought the French capital to a standstill and disrupted train and other public services in the rest of France. Other public sector professions including lawyers, teachers, hospital workers, opera singers and ballet dancers have also joined protests, but there have been few walk-outs in the private sector. The CFDT, which is broadly behind the pension reforms, called off its strikes and protests after the government made concessions. Last weekend, Laurent Djebali, representative of the UNSA-RATP union that represents the majority of drivers on the Paris Metro network, where many lines have been closed or severely disrupted December, said members had voted to return to work \u201cfor financial reasons\u201d; strikers in France are not paid. However, he said there was \u201cno question\u201d of calling off the strike altogether. The CGT, the country\u2019s oldest and most powerful union, has accused the CFDT of selling out to the government. This week is crucial to the government and union opposition in the pension reform dispute. The final text of the reform, a key element of Macron\u2019s successful 2017 election campaign, will be presented to the council of ministers on Friday. Leaked documents suggest much of the original bill \u2013 drawn up after an 18-month consultation of unions and management \u2013 remains intact. The most controversial point remains a move to keep the legal pension age at 62, but reduce the pensions paid to those who choose to leave work at that age and introduce a \u201cfull pension\u201d age of 65 by 2037. The government has a large parliamentary majority to push the reform through, but few expect the CGT, which has called for protests across France on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week to give up without a further fight.",

Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, who is also an Iran expert, is understood to have been seeking alternatives to paying off the debt, including through humanitarian aid such as food and medicine. Iranian officials have been trying to find out whether the UK regards this as a serious option, and some senior officials may visit London for talks.",

Ballistic missiles hit a mosque on Saturday at al-Estiqbal military camp in the central province of Ma\u2019rib, where soldiers had gathered for evening prayers. Pictures and video from the scene showed a huge impact crater in the spot where the mosque had stood. A spokesperson for the Yemeni armed forces, Abdu Abdullah Magli, said on Monday that the death toll was likely to rise again because of the serious nature of the injuries caused. While the government blamed the Houthi movement, which seized the capital, Sana\u2019a, six years ago, none of the many groups fighting in Yemen has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. Yemen\u2019s civil war escalated in 2015 when President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi fled to neighbouring Saudi Arabia and a Saudi-led coalition of 20 Arab nations intervened to try to defeat the Iran-backed Houthis. Since then the conflict has morphed into the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, killing an estimated 100,000 people and leaving 80% of the population \u2013 about 24 million people \u2013 dependent on aid to survive. Both sides have been accused of indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets. The attack on Saturday was followed by fierce fighting on Monday between government forces and the Houthis for control of a junction east of Ma\u2019rib on the road connecting the province to Sana\u2019a, as well as reports of Saudi-led airstrikes on both Sana\u2019a and the rebel-held Saada province. The senior Houthi commander Jaber Al Muwaed was killed on Monday, according to Saudi television channel al-Arabiya. The escalation comes after the UN special representative for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, last week celebrated a fall in violence across the country despite the heightened tensions between the US and Iran after the killing of the Iranian general, Qassem Suleimani, on 3 January. On the same day that a drone strike killed Suleimani in Baghdad, the US tried, but failed, to kill Abdul Reza Shahlai, a senior Iranian commander who was in Yemen. Suleimani\u2019s death prompted demonstrations against the US in Sana\u2019a and promises of revenge from the Houthi leadership. \u201cI have said before that the hard-earned progress that Yemen has made on de-escalation is very fragile.

      "bodyText": "The global chairman of PwC has warned that heads could roll at the professional services firm over its links to Isabel dos Santos, Africa\u2019s richest woman, who is battling allegations that she obtained her wealth through corruption and nepotism. Bob Moritz, whose firm advised companies belonging to Dos Santos and her husband across multiple jurisdictions, told the Guardian he was \u201cshocked and disappointed\u201d by recent disclosures about the British-headquartered accounting firm\u2019s work for the daughter of Angola\u2019s former president. The complex financial schemes that helped Dos Santos amass an estimated $2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) fortune at the expense of the Angolan state have been revealed this week in the Luanda Leaks investigation, based on a huge cache of documents leaked from her business empire. Moritz said a PwC investigation would examine whether any individuals at the partnership should lose leadership positions, have their bonuses docked or lose their jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ll look at the individual behaviours, as to whether they come out of leadership roles or have compensation implications, or maybe even [come] out of jobs,\u201d Moritz said, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for the investigation, I don\u2019t want to rush.

After being shut out by some of the world\u2019s biggest banks, Dos Santos had been relying increasingly on Eurobic, in which she holds a 42.5% stake, to move money. Eurobic issued a statement distancing itself from its main shareholder. Citing the Luanda Leaks, and the \u201cpublic perception that this bank may not entirely fulfil its obligations\u201d because Dos Santos was a shareholder, Eurobic said its board had decided to \u201cterminate the commercial relationship with entities controlled by [Dos Santos] and people closely related [to her]\u201d. The move comes as the fallout from the Dos Santos revelations shifts to the lawyers, accountants and other western companies that aided her business empire. The Luanda Leaks consist of a cache of 715,0000 files from the administrators of her empire, examined by the Guardian and media outlets in 20 countries in an investigation led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The documents suggest PwC, one of the big four global accountancy firms, acted as auditor, consultant and tax adviser to companies controlled by Dos Santos and her husband in Switzerland, Malta, the Netherlands and Angola. According to the New York Times, another ICIJ partner, PwC worked with 20 of their companies. Moritz said that from a reputational perspective, the Dos Santos story was the worst thing to have happened to PwC under his chairmanship, but he believed it was an exception and not the norm. The company, which made millions from its work for Dos Santos, previously said it was terminating any work for entities controlled by members of her family \u201cin response to the very serious and concerning allegations\u201d. After graduating from a British university, Dos Santos began her career at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which went on to become PricewaterhouseCoopers, or PwC. She later hired former PwC staff as close advisers. They include the chair of Fidequity, the Lisbon wealth management outfit that helped administer her empire and whose data forms part of the leak. When Dos Santos was appointed to run the Angolan state oil company, Sonangol, she recruited her chief financial officer from PwC. Moritz said he was disappointed that PwC had not picked up warning signals from its work in Angola. \u201cWhen we look at some of the signs that were there, we should have picked them up earlier, and that was our mistake,\u201d he said. Moritz said the investigation at PwC would go as high as it needed to, but he denied that his own job was at risk. Appointed in 2016, he is the chairman of the PwC International Network, which supports more than 276,000 employees in 157 countries.

Welcome to our night session coverage of day 2 of the Australian Open. And what a day this is. Rain washing out most of the matches on outside courts yesterday meant that we started the day with <em>96 </em>matches on the schedule. Some courts have seven matches scheduled for the day. At the time of writing, 6pm Melbourne time, 46 matches have been played and there are still 50 to be played. Last year the Australian Open had matches finishing at 3am so we are in for an extremely late finish.</p> <p>Daniil Medvedev will open the night session on Rod Laver Arena against Frances Tiafoe, who went viral in Melbourne last year as he marched to the quarters and did his best Lebron James impression to celebrate each win. A year later, he returns with a horrible draw and the knowledge that his ranking will tank should he lose today. In the women\u2019s night match, 18 year-old Italian Elisabetta Cocciaretto will face off against 2016 champion Angelique Kerber, who returns to the scene of her first slam in a slump and after some injury problems. Could a new star be born on Rod Laver Arena today?</p> <p>Over on Margaret Court Arena, Wimbledon champion Simona Halep will take to the court against Jennifer Brady, a young American with a big game who has started the season well and could provide a challenge for Halep. Alexander Zverev will follow the Romanian against clay court specialist Marco Cecchinato. Not too many people are picking Zverev after his horrendous start to the year at the ATP Cup, in which he served countless double faults and reduced his father to tears with his verbal abuse. However, this is a nice opening round to get his tournament started and perhaps find some rhythm.</p> <p>Finally, Nick Kyrgios will headline his own one-match night session on the Melbourne Arena where he will face Italy\u2019s Lorenzo Sonego. These are just the top courts and there will be a million other things going on today and we will be following it all.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me on day two of the Australian Open. Thanks for following and until tomorrow. Below is our coverage of today\u2019s action. John Isner says that he is donating $100 for each ace. This may add up quickly. US number one John Isner finally reaches the second round, beating Thiago Monteiro 6-7(5) 7-6(4) 7-6(7) 7-6(5). Between them, they only generated 5 break points in 3 hours and 27 minutes and there were zero breaks. Despite the fact that the big names have gone home, this crazy day of 88 matches is still not over. Casper Ruud just took Egor Gerasimov into a fifth set from two sets down and Kevin Anderson leads 6-4 2-6 2-4 6-4 *3-2 against Ilya Ivashka after looking almost down at 4-1* down in the fourth set. Two more to go. Here is Kevin Mitchell on the doubt surrounding Maria Sharapova\u2019s future and shoulder after her straight sets loss to Donna Vekic today. Just a regular day at the office for John Isner. Here is Russell Jackson on Nick Kyrgios\u2019 win today. More scores: Angelique Kerber opens her tournament with a solid 6-2 6-2 win over Elisabetta Cocciaretto. A brilliant win for 21 year-old Aussie wildcard Priscilla Hon, who dispatched Kateryna Kozlova 6-3 6-4 to reach the second round of her home slam for the first time. It is only her second slam win in total. A huge moment for her. The eternal giant Ivo Karlovic is through 7-6(4) 6-4 7-5 over Vasek Pospisil. Karlovic is 40 years old and he turned professional in 2000. On he goes. Sascha Zverev wins his first match of 2020 and it wasn\u2019t bad at all. There was none of the dire serving that blighted him at the ATP Cup, with only four double faults. A good performance that should give him some confidence. An update from around the grounds: Angelique Kerber currently leads 18 year old Elisabetta Cocciaretto 6-2 4-0* and is well on her way. Alexander Zverev is in a good position against Marco Cecchinato, closing down on victory at 6-4 7-6(4) 3-2*. He has served only four double faults today, which, frankly, is a miracle after his serving disasters at the ATP Cup. Aussie wildcard Priscilla Hon leads Kateryna Kozlova 6-3 *3-0. John Isner is in a tiebreak battle with Brazil\u2019s Thiago Monteiro. The score is split at one set all, with everything still to play for: 6-7(5) 7-6(4) *4-4 After her routine loss to Donna Vekic today, Maria Sharapova\u2019s future is far from clear. An astonishing sequence of events. Dart held double match point on her serve at *6-5 in the third set, then she badly missed two forehands in a row and lost 9 of the next 10 points to fall down 1-5 in the third set tiebreak. From 1-5 in the tiebreak, Dart then won 9 of the next 10 points herself to win the match. Dart cut out her errors and forced Doi to hit through her. The Japanese player simply couldn\u2019t do so. A year after suffering the humiliation of a double bagel against her hero Maria Sharapova on Rod Laver Arena, Dart is only the second Brit through to the second round so far. This also marks her first slam win outside of Wimbledon. In the end, the Frenchman just had too much firepower for Cameron Norrie. He trusted himself, he kept on moving forward to the net and he smothered Norrie at times towards the end. A tough defeat for Norrie to swallow after leading two sets to one and generating ample break points in the fourth set. Third set: Harriet Dart 2-6 6-4 6-6 Misaki Doi: Oh dear. Dart courageously moved up two match points, defending well and imposing herself whenever she could. However, she completely blinked on both match points, firing two successive forehand errors well wide. The second was particularly dire - a forehand error an easy short ball after a good serve. A ten point tiebreak will decide the battle and Dart will need to demonstrate a lot of resilience to see it through. Elsewhere, Pierre-Hugues Herbert will serve for the match against Cameron Norrie at *5-4 in the fifth. Third set: Harriet Dart 2-6 6-4 *6-5 Misaki Doi: Harriet Dart will serve for the match after an error-strewn service game from Doi, sealed with a forehand into the bottom of the net. Fifth set: Cameron Norrie 5-7 6-3 6-3 5-7 3-4* Pierre-Hugues Herbert: Herbert\u2019s game is starting to flow and after finally breaking Norrie\u2019s serve with some bruising forehands, he held for 4-2 to consolidate the break. A good hold by Norrie followed, sealed to 15 with an unreturned serve. But this is an uphill battle and he desperately needs a break. Meanwhile, Harriet Dart has levelled at 5-5 with a brilliant backhand down the line winner. Third set: Harriet Dart 2-6 6-4 *4-5 Misaki Doi: Dart had break point to move up 5-4, but she failed to convert. The Brit finally gave the game away with a return error and now she must serve to stay in the match after dropping her last two service games. Tense moments. Svetlana Kuznetsova takes out fifteenth seed Marketa Vondrousova 6-2 4-6 6-4. A great win for the veteran champion. Third set: Harriet Dart 2-6 6-4 4-4* Misaki Doi: This is so intense. With her back to the wall, Dart saved four break points, barking \u2018c\u2019mon\u2019 with each reprieve. However, Doi\u2019s groundstrokes just cut through the court a lot better than Dart\u2019s. After too many unforced errors on big points, Doi snapped a backhand down the line winner followed by a forehand inside out winner to hold. There was just not much that Dart could do. Third set: Harriet Dart 2-6 6-4 *4-3 Misaki Doi: Impressive resilience from Dart, who lost her break lead at 3-3 and then fell down 30-0 in Doi\u2019s service game. But the Brit battled hard and restored her break, with Doi sending a forehand well wide on break point. Fifth set: Cameron Norrie 5-7 6-3 6-3 5-7 1-0* Pierre-Hugues Herbert: Norrie coolly saves a break point in a long opening deuce game in the final set, sealed by a missed return from Herbert after a solid swinging Norrie serve. Plenty of long, tentative rallies. Who will step up? Fourth set: Cameron Norrie 5-7 6-3 6-3 5-7 Pierre-Hugues Herbert: Cameron Norrie is heading to a fifth set on Court 15. After an extremely tight fourth set, Herbert edged it out with his only break point of the entire set. It was quite a scrappy set all round with 9 winners and 18 unforced errors by Herbert and 7 winners, 20 unforced errors from Norrie. Both players are feeling the weight of the occasion and the huge opportunity here. It should make for a gripping third set. More from Nick Kyrgios. John McEnroe, the interviewer, congratulated him for helping with the bushfire relief: I appreciate that. You\u2019ll make me tear up again. I thought the ATP Cup was great preparation. Obviously I\u2019m still heartbroken about Demon [Alex de Minaur withdrew from the Australian Open]. If you\u2019re watching this, that was for you little fella. I hope you\u2019re resting up. I feel good, I\u2019m not looking ahead at the draw. Everyone can play in the draw. They\u2019re all capable, so I\u2019m not looking ahead at all. Nicholas Hilmy Kyrgios on his solid first round win: I was just really excited to get out here. Obviously it\u2019s been a pretty emotional couple of months for all of us so I just wanted to come out here and put on a good performance. I was really excited. It was awesome. He\u2019s a tough competitor, he\u2019s a very good player. I played him once and I knew it was gonna be tough. I\u2019m just super excited to get out here and play in front of you guys. Kyrgios also noted that an overzealous fan had too many beers to drink. Drink responsibly. A solid performance from Kyrgios who served well and produced his best tennis whenever he needed to on the important points. The Australian looks as relaxed as ever. We\u2019ll see where it takes him. An up-and-down performance from the US Open finalist, but every time his level dropped, he responded with pure quality. He is going to be so tough to beat in these conditions. For Tiafoe, a first round loss is a tough pill to swallow after his quarterfinal run last year. He is now down to around 78th in the rankings and he will need to find some form soon. A quick general update: Fourth seed Daniil Medvedev leads Frances Tiafoe 6-3 4-6 6-4 5-2* and is well on his way to victory. Seventh seed Alexander Zverev just nabbed the first set 6-4 against Marco Cecchinato. Nick Kyrgios just guaranteed himself nothing worse than a tiebreak in set three, the score now 6-2 7-6(3) 6-5*. Marketa Vondrousova has just pushed Svetlana Kuznetsova to a third set, with the score 2-6 6-4. Harriet Dart has taken a break in the third set and now leads Misaki Doi 2-6 6-4 *1-0. Cameron Norrie and Pierre-Hugues Herbert remain on serve in the fourth set, with Norrie leading 5-7 6-3 6-3 4-3*. Some tennis players live in bubbles. Giorgi\u2019s next opponent is either two-time slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova and last year\u2019s French Open runner up Marketa Vondrousova. They are not exactly nobodies. Then again, this isn\u2019t quite as bad as when Giorgi was due to face Serena Williams at Wimbledon in 2018. Her response when asked about Williams: \u201cI don\u2019t follow tennis, women\u2019s tennis, and I don\u2019t follow tennis.\u201d Third set: Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(3) 5-4* Lorenzo Sonego: Nick Kyrgios is within a game of the second round. He sealed the hold with what is fast becoming one of his many trademark shots: a beautiful forehand drop shot winner. Second set: Harriet Dart 2-6 6-4 Misaki Doi: Quite an effort from Harriet Dart, who has levelled the match after losing 8 games in a row between the first and second sets. This is a huge opportunity for her first overseas slam win. An underrated storyline in tennis today is the resilience of Gael Monfils, who continues to command a spot in the top 10 at 33 and was a reserve at the ATP Finals in London last year. He will not win this title, but he is certainly capable of a nice run if the cards fall his way. He moves on. Third set: Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(3) 3-2* Lorenzo Sonego: Kyrgios was understandably seething and muttering as he failed to nab break points at 2-1, and his frustration seeped into his service game as he double faulted before watching Sonego crush a return winner to move up 0-30. How did Kyrgios respond from 0-30? Unreturned serve, unreturned serve, a volley winner after a magnificent cat and mouse point, unreturned serve. Easy. In one of the more mouthwatering first round matches, an \u201cupset\u201d is brewing on court one. French Open finalist and 15th seed Marketa Vondrousova is down 6-2 2-1 to two time slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, who is still playing quality tennis at 34 as she enters her third decade on tour. Third set: Daniil Medvedev 6-3 4-6 6-4 Frances Tiafoe: Daniil Medvedev is one set away. He wrestled control of the set with style, breaking Tiafoe to love in the final game after an incredible final point: after an incredible run to meet a drop volley from Tiafoe, the Russian responded with his own angled dropshot to outwit the American and take the set. For such a wiry, lanky six foot two man, Medvedev\u2019s athleticism is quite astounding. Third set: Cameron Norrie 5-7 6-3 6-3 Pierre-Hugues Herbert: Quite an effort from Norrie to take the third set. The errors are beginning to pile up for Herbert, who was the author of his own misfortune as he serve and volleyed on set point but failed to deal with a quite simple Norrie return. Norrie has cut down on his errors (20 from Herbert, 10 from Norrie) and he is reaping the rewards. Third set: Cameron Norrie 5-7 6-3 5-3* Pierre-Hugues Herbert: Good work from Cameron Norrie, who is grinding hard and has turned this match around. After breaking serve, he immediately holds to move to within a game of taking a 2-1 sets lead. Alexander Zverev is warming up against Marco Cecchinato on Margaret Court Arena. This is a nice opening match for the German against a clay court specialist, but the big question is whether he can keep his double faults down after an abysmal opening week of the season at the ATP Cup. Second set: Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(3) Lorenzo Sonego: Nick Kyrgios moves ahead by two sets after a really mature tiebreak. At 4-3, he was extremely patient until Sonego\u2019s backhand broke down. Then he bunted a brilliant point-ending backhand down the line at 5-3. He took the set with another perfectly weighted forehand dropshot. He is playing very well and, more importantly, rising on the big points. One set away. Second set: Nick Kyrgios 6-2 6-6 Lorenzo Sonego: Melbourne Arena is heading to a tiebreak after ample big serving and quick holds from both. Kyrgios served three aces in a row from 0-15 down at *5-6. He went for a fourth ace, but he had to settle for an unreturned serve. Heartbreaking. Second set: Harriet Dart 2-6 *0-1 Misaki Doi: A tough run of games for qualifier Harriet Dart, who has lost 6 games in a row from 2-1 up in the first set. This is a winnable match but she urgently needs to halt the momentum. Another Aussie is through. This time the fiery Arina Rodionova. Definitely was a tough match. I knew because we played against each other a few months ago and it was 6-4 in the third so I was expecting to play as much as possible. I\u2019m really happy to be through to the third round and it\u2019s a very nice feeling to play here in Australia. What a brutally tough first set that was. Halep saved three points, battled back as Brady served for the set and then flourished in the second set. As tough as the opening set was in the moment, Halep will surely look back on it as very helpful as she attempts to move forward in the draw. A very good win for the Wimbledon champion. We will probably see a lot more of Jennifer Brady this year. Second set: Jennifer Brady 6-7(5) *1-5 Simona Halep: Simona Halep has hit three winners and three unforced errors so far in the second set. She is giving absolutely nothing away and, across the net, Brady is surely still thinking of those three missed set points. One game away. Also, keep an eye out for Andrey Rublev in Melbourne. The 22 year old has won two titles in two weeks this year and today\u2019s victory was his 13th consecutive win. He may eventually burn out at some point over the next two weeks but few players are quite as confident as him right now. It is 8:40 in Melbourne right now. There are still 27 matches to be completed today. It is fair to say that a lot is happening right now: Daniil Medvedev opened the third set with a hold to move up 6-3 4-6 1-0* on Frances Tiafoe. Simona Halep has broken early in the second set against Jennifer Brady. She leads 7-6 3-1* and is well on her way to victory. Nick Kyrgios is still on serve in the second set against Lorenzo Sonego, the score standing at 6-2 *3-4. Gael Monfils is cruising on the 1573 arena with a 6-1 6-4 lead over Lu Yen-hsun Harriet Dart has started on court 11 against Misaki Doi and the pair are level at 2-2. Cameron Norrie is level with Pierre-Hugues Herbert early in set three: 7-5 3-6 1-1* Second set: Cameron Norrie 5-7 6-3 Pierre-Hugues Herbert: At last, a British player has finally won a set today. Cameron Norrie levels Herbert at one set all. Second set: Daniil Medvedev 6-3 4-6 Frances Tiafoe: Tiafoe has levelled fourth seed Medvedev at one set all in style. Some brilliant serving from Tiafoe to dig out the final game from 15-30 down. No problems for the Dutch number one, a dark horse in Melbourne, who moves on. First set: Jennifer Brady 6-7(5) Simona Halep: Great effort from Simona Halep, who saved three set points before finally edging ahead after a 70 minute first set. Brady has proven the great challenge many people expected her to be, but when the rallies lengthen and the points become heavier, it is a heck of a lot more difficult to beat a top player. First set: Nick Kyrgios 6-2 Lorenzo Sonego: Nick Kyrgios pulls out a great hold from 0-30 down to take the first set on his favourite court. Kyrgios from 0-30 down: Ace, unreturned serve, point ending backhand, unreturned serve. Kyrgios ended the set with 5 games in a row from *1-2. Momentum building. First set: Nick Kyrgios *5-2 Lorenzo Sonego: Nick Kyrgios is cleaning up on Melbourne Arena. He now leads by a double break and will serve for the set. First set: Jennifer Brady 6-6 (3-4*) Simona Halep: Tense, tense moments on Margaret Court Arena as Brady fails to serve out the set at *6-5. Halep saved three set points before breaking with a slick backhand passing shot. The rallies are long and tense and this tiebreak will be decided in the head. Halep holds a slender lead at the break. First set: Nick Kyrgios *3-2 Lorenzo Sonego: After four quick opening service games, Kyrigos finally made his move in the fifth game, generating three break points and putting immense pressure on Sonego\u2019s service game by moving him from side to side whenever possible in the baseline rallies. Kyrgios broke with typical variety: a lovely forehand drop shot on break point. Sonego reached the dropper with some good movement but his response flew wide. Second set: Cameron Norrie 5-7 1-0* Pierre-Hugues Herbert: Bad news for Norrie, who loses a tight first set to Herbert. There was not too much at all to separate the pair - Herbert has 17 winners to 13 unforced errors while Norrie has 14 winners to 12. But Herbert took his one break point in the opening set and Norrie missed his one break point. Simple. A long way to go in this one. First set: Nick Kyrgios *1-2 Lorenzo Sonego: All eyes will be on Kyrgios as usual, but Sonego has a big serve, a huge forehand and plenty of talent himself. The Italian holds to 30 with a booming ace out wide to keep himself ahead. First set: Daniil Medvedev 6-3 Frances Tiafoe: After looking like he had lost concentration in the middle of the opening set, Daniil Medvedev recovered in spectacular fashion. He held serve with the most insane defence at the net, fielding five bullet groundstrokes from Tiafoe before finally dispatching his fifth volley via his frame to hold. A couple of incredible demonstrations of athelticism followed at 5-3 as he recovered the double break to take the set. First set Jennifer Brady *4-5 Simona Halep: Simona Halep has weathered the storm and moved ahead for the first time on Margaret Court Arena. Halep is being a little more aggressive, cutting out her errors and putting more pressure on the American, who is finally starting to miss more. As Nick Kyrgios and Lorenzo Sonego begin on Melbourne Arena, check out Russell Jackson on Kyrgios. First set: Daniil Medvedev *4-3 Frances Tiafoe: On Rod Laver Arena, Daniil Medvedev burst out of the starting blocks, flitting to a double break lead at *4-1. But he seems to have lost his concentration and he has been extremely erratic over the past couple of games, allowing Tiafoe to retrieve one of the breaks. This is a huge match for Tiafoe, who really failed to kick on after his great run to the quarters in Melbourne last year. Should he lose today, Tiafoe will fall to around 78th in the rankings. That is not ideal. First set: Jennifer Brady *4-3 Simona Halep: Let\u2019s talk about Jennifer Brady. The 24 year-old American is currently ranked at a career high of 49 and she started the year with an exclamation mark, qualifying in Brisbane before defeating Maria Sharapova and world number one Ashleigh Barty back-to-back to reach the quarters. She is a very typical American player with a big serve and a huge, heavy topspin forehand and she is currently bullying Halep around the court with her big weapons. Brady\u2019s average forehand speed so far today is 77mph, which would be a big number for male players. Halep\u2019s average forehand speed? 67mph. The question is whether the challenger can keep up this high level. There is plenty happening around Melbourne Park right now: In-form American Jennifer Brady has started as fast as many predicted she would, breaking fourth seed Simona Halep in the opening game and moving to a 3-1* lead. Men\u2019s fourth seed Daniil Medvedev and Frances Tiafoe are out on court, with Medvedev snatching the opening break for a *2-1 lead. Jo Wilfried Tsonga was forced to retire against Alexei Popyrin with the score at (5)6-7, 6-2, 6-1. Britain\u2019s Cameron Norrie has begun his first round against Pierre Hugues-Herbert. All even at 2-2 so far. It will not be easy. The fifth seed comes through. After being pegged back to 5-5, Boulter regained her focus and was extremely solid, seeing out the win with a whistling forehand down the line passing shot. A good workout for Svitolina and a good showing for Boulter, who should be very happy with her level in only her second match back at WTA level. Second set: Elina Svitolina 6-4 6-5* Katie Boulter: Svitolina gets herself back on track with aplomb, sealing a hold to 15 by forcing a Boulter error with a slick forehand down the line. The pressure returns to the shoulders of the Brit as she serves to stay in the match. Second set: Elina Svitolina 6-4 *5-5 Katie Boulter: Katie Boulter does indeed hold to level the match. Just more vicious hitting from the Brit - a huge forehand crosscourt winner brought her to 40-15 and then she held with a 112mph ace down the T. It doesn\u2019t get much better than that. Now it is for Svitolina to respond. Second set: Elina Svitolina 6-4 5-4* Katie Boulter: Impressive work from Katie Boulter to break back at the death thanks to a mixture of brutal hitting and touch. After a violent backhand down the line winner earlier on in the game, she broke to love with a beautiful backhand lob. Back on serve now, but she still has to hold. Heather Watson will not take to the court today against Kristyna Pliskova. Her match has been cancelled along with 7 other matches. It\u2019s past 7pm in Melbourne and there are still just the 38 matches to complete today... Second set: Elina Svitolina 6-4 5-2* Katie Boulter: Svitolina captures her fourth and fifth consecutive games to move to within a game of victory. The fifth seed is so solid and refusing to give up any free points now, while Boulter is just beginning to be a little too erratic. Boulter closed off her service game with two consecutive backhand unforced errors, then Svitolina strolled to another easy hold. Second set: Elina Svitolina 6-4 3-2* Katie Boulter: Boulter hit extremely well to eke out a tight deuce hold to consolidate her break for a 2-0 lead, but she is just a little too overzealous on the ball right now. At *2-1 30-30, she sprayed a wild forehand wide and then moved forward to the net on a dire approach, allowing Svitolina to pick her off with an easy passing shot and break her back. Svitolina had no trouble holding with ease to edge ahead again. Boulter clearly understands that she has to be aggressive but it has to be done with slightly more guile. What a score! Muguruza withdrew from her last match before the Australian Open with a viral illness and during the first set it was all too easy to assume that she was feeling the effects in the first set. Evidently not. Regardless of how she got there, an essential win for Muguruza as she tries to rebuild her career. Muguruza is currently ranked 32nd and she is unseeded in Melbourne after another torrid season which finally forced her to split with her former coach Sam Sumyk. She has arrived in Australia with her new coach Conchita Martinez and we will see if the former number one and two-time slam champion can work her way back to the top. Second set: Elina Svitolina 6-4 0-1* Katie Boulter: Some brutal hitting from Boulter to open the second set and she immediately breaks. She sealed her first break of Svitolina\u2019s serve with a flat, searing forehand winner. Game on. Elina Svitolina 6-4 Katie Boulter: As she often does, Elina Svitolina pounced in the final game of the first set, nabbing the break and set with a big forehand winner. A good showing from Boulter so far. We\u2019ll see how long she can hang with the fifth seed in set two. It is particularly great to see Katie Boulter back after the terrible 9 months she has had. Last April, Boulter performed admirably as she helped Great Britain defeat Kazakstan in a dramatic Fed Cup tie. But her commitment came at a cost as Boulter was competing with an injured back that she aggravated during the tie, forcing her out until she returned to some lowly ITF challenger events in November. Her ranking fell as low as 351 after she sat around her career high of 82 in April. That was unfortunate enough, but a few months later she was also subjected to some intense criticism at the French Open. Despite the severity of her injury, she entered the French Open draw and didn\u2019t withdraw until after the qualifying draw had begun. By withdrawing late, she was entitled to 50% of the first round prize money. In hindsight, thank heavens she did since she didn\u2019t have any playing income for 7 months after that. Svitolina leads 5-4 on serve. A few things are happening right now: Britain\u2019s Katie Boulter is facing off against fifth seed Elina Svitolina and she is currently performing well, with the match on serve at 4-3 to Svitolina in the 1573 Arena. Jo Wilfried Tsonga just took the first set 7-6(5) against young Australian Alexei Popyrin in the Melbourne Arena. Garbine Muguruza is en route to a completely bizarre win over qualifier Shelby Rodgers. The score is now 0-6 6-1 4-0. 17th seed Andrey Rublev, one of the most talented and in-form young players around, is just starting against Australian wildcard Christopher O\u2019Connell. It has not been a great day for British interests. Here is Kevin Mitchell on the defeats of Kyle Edmund and Johanna Konta, both of whom came up against tough first round opposition in Dusan Lajovic and Ons Jabeur. Hello! Welcome to our night session coverage of day 2 of the Australian Open. And what a day this is. Rain washing out most of the matches on outside courts yesterday meant that we started the day with 96 matches on the schedule. Some courts have seven matches scheduled for the day. At the time of writing, 6pm Melbourne time, 46 matches have been played and there are still 50 to be played. Last year the Australian Open had matches finishing at 3am so we are in for an extremely late finish. Daniil Medvedev will open the night session on Rod Laver Arena against Frances Tiafoe, who went viral in Melbourne last year as he marched to the quarters and did his best Lebron James impression to celebrate each win. A year later, he returns with a horrible draw and the knowledge that his ranking will tank should he lose today. In the women\u2019s night match, 18 year-old Italian Elisabetta Cocciaretto will face off against 2016 champion Angelique Kerber, who returns to the scene of her first slam in a slump and after some injury problems. Could a new star be born on Rod Laver Arena today? Over on Margaret Court Arena, Wimbledon champion Simona Halep will take to the court against Jennifer Brady, a young American with a big game who has started the season well and could provide a challenge for Halep. Alexander Zverev will follow the Romanian against clay court specialist Marco Cecchinato. Not too many people are picking Zverev after his horrendous start to the year at the ATP Cup, in which he served countless double faults and reduced his father to tears with his verbal abuse. However, this is a nice opening round to get his tournament started and perhaps find some rhythm. Finally, Nick Kyrgios will headline his own one-match night session on the Melbourne Arena where he will face Italy\u2019s Lorenzo Sonego. These are just the top courts and there will be a million other things going on today and we will be following it all.",

      "bodyText": "Workers\u2019 rights and protections for women could be under threat after Boris Johnson added a range of changes to the withdrawal agreement bill following the December general election, the Labour leadership contender Lisa Nandy has claimed. The MP for Wigan said a series of answers to parliamentary questions that she tabled showed key protections embedded in European court of justice case law could be ignored by the government. They include provisions for pregnant women, equal pay for men and women, and holiday pay. Nandy said: \u201cIt is absolutely disgraceful that Boris Johnson wants to cast new doubt on rights for women at work that we have taken for granted for decades. \u201cThe withdrawal agreement bill means women in Belfast will be protected permanently against discrimination at work, but women in Bolsover won\u2019t have the same guarantees from next year. That\u2019s completely unacceptable.\u201d Nandy presented the government with a series of European court of justice judgments to check what their new status would be under the European withdrawal bill following the election. They included a key judgment from 1994 on equal pay that means employers who pay men more than women have to explain why the difference is not due to discrimination. Others included judgments from 2006 and 2011 that stopped the practice of rolling holiday pay into wages and employers refusing to pay allowances as part of paid leave. Judgments on pregnant women from 1990 and 1994, which ruled against employers refusing to employ women when they found out they were pregnant, were also included. The Brexit minister James Duddridge confirmed that \u201ceach of the cases named in the parliamentary questions will be categorised as retained EU law\u201d under the bill. Nandy claims this gives ministers a new power to tell lower courts dealing with routine cases that they can set aside EU case law when making judgments. This has led to fears that standards could be set at a lower level than current EU rules. Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, also confirmed that the legal obligation not to roll back EU law on discrimination against women in work applied only in Northern Ireland, not the rest of the UK. In a parliamentary question asking whether specific EU council directives on equal employment rights would apply to the whole of the UK, Smith replied that they applied to \u201cNorthern Ireland only\u201d. Downing Street has insisted that details on workers\u2019 rights would be contained in a new employment bill to ensure that the country was the \u201cbest place in the world to work\u201d and that they would not be watered down. A spokesperson for the prime minister said in December: \u201cOnce Brexit is done, we will continue to lead the way and set a high standard, building on existing employment law with measures which protect those in low-paid work. \u201cThis is on top of the largest upgrade to workers\u2019 rights in a generation that the government is bringing forward.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The publication of photographs showing the Duchess of Sussex with her baby son in Canada has prompted a warning by the royal couple\u2019s lawyers against running images taken in such circumstances. The warning comes as a debate over paparazzi photos was reignited after some sections of the press broke a self-imposed embargo introduced after the death of Prince Harry\u2019s mother, Diana, more than two decades ago. Since then, there has been a long running, often bitter feud between Prince Harry and the paparazzi. Here is some of the background. How did the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, change the British media? No formal pact was entered into, but the death of Harry\u2019s mother following a high speed pursuit of her car through Paris by photographers resulted in a public backlash against sections of the press who had chronicled her every move. Eight days after her death in 1997, the Daily Mail pledged to ban paparazzi photographs from its pages, claiming that it was \u201cleading the way\u201d with the move. Others too embraced hitherto alien notions of privacy in an echo of a \u201cgentlemen\u2019s\u201d agreement that had already been in place from 1995 in relation to coverage, or the lack of it, of Prince William going to Eton at the age of 13. Other changes included a strengthening of the editor\u2019s code of practice by the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) and, after Diana\u2019s death, the introduction of The Protection from Harassment Act (PHA). The PPC made specific provisions for the young princes, affording them protection while conceding that there could not be a \u201ctotal blackout\u201d on all stories about them at school. By 1999 it had judged its code to have been so successful that paparazzi who were once very much in evidence in and around Eton had virtually disappeared \u2013 \u201caware that there is no market for their pictures in the British press\u201d. Did it last? While the informal understanding between the royals and Fleet Street was renewed in 2000, the pact began to fray after William went to university. There was a change in pace too after the profile of the Duchess of Cambridge \u2013 then Kate Middleton \u2013 grew. While much has been made recently of the intensely critical attitude taken by Harry and Meghan towards media coverage, back in 2007 Kate was making complaints to the police about the paparazzi\u2019s pursuit of her after a breakup from William. What provoked the latest row? The images that sparked a legal warning by the couple show Meghan walking with the couple\u2019s son, Archie, in Canadian woodland. They have been used in a number of outlets, notably on the front page of the Sun, and were said to have been taken by photographers concealed in bushes. Last year Harry accepted substantial damages and an apology from a news agency that took aerial photographs of his Cotswolds home, forcing him and Meghan to move out. However, the new photos from Canada are said by lawyers for the Sussexes to have been part of a spate of \u201cunacceptable\u201d paparazzi behaviour, including attempts to photograph them inside their home using long-range lenses. Will the couple\u2019s move toward spending most of their time in North America make a difference to how the media cover them? According to Mark Thompson, CEO of the New York Times and a former BBC director general, it is possible that by \u201cnot doing the kind of things that the paparazzi and celebrity hounds find interesting, you begin to have a quieter life\u201d. On the other hand, in the US at least, there are broader freedoms over issues such as privacy, the paparazzi are not constrained by the informal rules drawn up following the death of Diana and the couple are moving to an environment in which supermarket tabloids and websites such as TMZ remain as popular as ever. As for Canada, relevant laws have been in flux in recent years with \u201cintrusion upon seclusion\u201d now recognised as a tort, or civil wrong. In comparison to its southern neighbour, the country\u2019s media have also had more of a culture of self-censorship according to Lisa Taylor, an assistant professor at Ryerson University\u2019s school of journalism. \u201cThat more genteel approach is beginning to change however and it\u2019s going to be interesting given that we tend to take some cues from the US and UK in equal measure,\u201d she added. A figure at one of the Fleet Street outlets deeply invested in coverage of the Sussexes said: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that photos of Meghan are red hot at the moment and people will be making a few bob out of it.\u201d Images could change hands for tens of thousands of pounds, he added, and there was an expectation that new freelance operations will spring up in Canada to cover the Sussexes. But he cautioned: \u201cIt\u2019s notable that a lot of papers have held off on using what the Sun published today and I think people will abide by the rules.\u201d The notion that the \u201cgloves will come off\u201d in terms of UK press coverage of Meghan and Harry was also rejected by Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors. Will the move mean anything in terms of their legal protection and remedies available to them? The existence in British Columbia, where Meghan has recently been photographed, of a \u201cprivacy act\u201d enabling people to take legal action \u201cagainst someone who unreasonably invades their privacy\u201d has been cited in some quarters. As for Britain, the same codes governing press use of images irrespective of where they have been taken remain in place . The Sussexes are also likely to draw succour from a 2014 high court decision to award \u00a310,000 of privacy damages to three of the musician Paul Weller\u2019s children after photographs taken of them on a California shopping trip were \u201cplastered\u201d over Mail Online. A subsequent unsuccessful attempt to appeal argued that the judgment created what was, in effect, an \u201cimage right\u201d for the first time. Ian Murray argued that the press had taken great care and made strong steps towards self-regulation through initiatives such as the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), and said: \u201cThat is not going to be thrown out just because Harry and Meghan have said they want to step out of the limelight.\u201d But he predicted that there would be a \u201chealthy debate\u201d about privacy and censorship, which would take account of how the press had the right to cover public figures. \u201cThere are guidelines there about what is public and what is private and they will still apply,\u201d he added. Within them, it was \u201ca bit rich saying you can only take photos when we want you to.\u201d",

Turing, a great of British science, was persecuted for his homosexuality and died in 1954, aged 41, his death ruled a suicide. His reputation has since been fully restored and celebrated. In July 2019 a member of the government committee which decided he should appear on the new \u00a350 note, Dr Emily Grossman, wrote in the Guardian: \u201cHis contribution to science is clear. \u201c[He was] the father of computer science, a significant influence on the modern field of artificial intelligence and most importantly, his work at Bletchley Park during the second world war led a team of code-breakers to crack the German Enigma code.\u201d In 2008, the Princeton Alumni Weekly named Turing the college\u2019s second-most influential graduate, behind only James Madison, the fourth American president who was one of the authors of the US constitution.

On Friday, in court filings reported by the Boulder Daily Camera and other outlets, federal officials said they had recovered and were seeking the forfeiture of Turing\u2019s degree certificate, the medal and photos, reports and letters from his time at boarding school.

I was not aware that she had taken them, nor indeed was the librarian! I asked him to make a list of the missing items but it proved to be incomplete because we had no inventory anyway. \u201cI gave up any hope of ever getting AT\u2019s things back \u2019til one day she wrote saying she was sending them back. A parcel arrived. It contained more than the librarian had listed, which made me cross. I wrote thanking her and she told me she intended to join the US Army and was training hard for the US Olympic team (track). I wished her luck and heard no more.\u201d That package evidently did not contain the certificate, medal and other items. In 2018, prompted by their being offered to the Colorado university library, federal officials searched a home and recovered the items. Should they ever reach the market, they could prove valuable: in 2015 one of Turing\u2019s notebooks sold for more than $1m at auction in New York. In her piece for the Guardian last year, Grossman wrote: \u201cTuring\u2019s importance goes beyond science. \u201cShortly after the war, he was prosecuted by the British government for \u2018gross indecency\u2019 due to his relationship with another man. He chose to undergo a year of chemical castration rather than face a prison sentence, but he died two years later, aged 41. The inquest found that his death from cyanide poisoning had been suicide. \u201cIn 2009 Gordon Brown issued Turing an apology on behalf of the government \u2013 and in 2013 the Queen officially pardoned him. \u201cThis may have seemed too little, too late, but such public acknowledgment of his mistreatment by the state helped pave the way for the subsequent government pardoning of nearly 50,000 homosexual men who had been historically cautioned or convicted for homosexual acts.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u2018When we filmed this,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/15/ai-weiwei-remembering-sichuan-earthquake\">Ai Weiwei</a>, \u201cthe elephants didn\u2019t know what to do. Once they were used for labour, and now they have lost their job.\u201d The artist is talking about the groundbreaking documentary he has just made about unemployed logging elephants in Myanmar. You watch the film, shot with 360-degree virtual reality technology, through a special headset. Turn your head slowly and your view gradually changes. Turn your head 180 degrees and the picture changes completely.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they lost their job,\u201d he continues, \u201ceach elephant had a few people to take care of it, so those people also lost their job.\u201d Ai (Weiwei is his first name and means unknown or future) relates to the elephants as readily as he does to the subject of the second part of his VR project \u2013 this one about the lives of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/22/rohingya-refugees-turn-down-second-myanmar-repatriation-effort\">Rohingya refugees</a> in a Bangladeshi camp.</p> <p>Rather than showing the suffering in the camp, Ai focuses on moments of joy: we see the wonder of children as the food trucks arrive, the generous portions of meat given out to celebrate Eid, the dazzling school built for the kids. \u201cI feel [there are] a lot of positive things about humanity even in the worst conditions,\u201d Ai says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to show there is just sadness.\u201d</p> <p>The Chinese artist and activist understands loss, displacement and existential danger as well as anybody. And what he wants to talk about today is his personal sense of threat. It\u2019s four months since Ai quit Germany for Britain, and he is adapting quickly to his new home. He orders English breakfast tea and lays into the country that gave him refuge after fleeing China in 2015. Germany is intolerant, bigoted and authoritarian, he says. And he\u2019s barely started.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woeI8i5Yd_M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/woeI8i5Yd_M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Unemployed elephants \u2026 Ai Weiwei\u2019s first virtual reality artwork, Omni</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Does he really believe that post-Brexit Britain will prove a haven of tolerance? He smiles and says he\u2019s here primarily for his son. He believes 10-year-old Lao will get a good education in Britain \u2013 and will be safe. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to live in harsh conditions. I don\u2019t think Germany provides a good environment for foreigners.\u201d He mentions that Lao was recently threatened by a shop owner there.</p> <p>While Ai insists he has no illusions about Britain, he still thinks it will be better for his family. \u201cIn Britain they are colonial. They are polite at least. But in Germany, they don\u2019t have this politeness. They would say in Germany you have to speak German. They have been very rude in daily situations. They deeply don\u2019t like foreigners.\u201d If Britain does let him down, he assures me <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/13/ai-weiwei-brits-brexit-chinese-dissident\">he\u2019ll let us all know</a>.</p> <p>We meet at an upmarket hotel in Cambridge, the city where the 62-year-old now lives. He is dressed in trademark black, head shaved and beard clipped. There is something mesmerising about him: he has the appearance of a bouncer, the manner of a priest and the language of a revolutionary. With the gentlest of voices, he continues to eviscerate Germany. \u201cI don\u2019t like a state or culture that so obeys authority.\u201d Ai has never been one for obeying authority.</p> <p>He slurps his tea and smiles. \u201cGermany is a very precise society. Its people love the comfort of being oppressed. In China, too, you see that. Once you\u2019re used to it, it can be very enjoyable. And you can see the efficiency, the show, the sense of their power being extended through the connected-mind condition.\u201d You mean there is no room for individuality? \u201cYes. They have a different kind of suit: it doesn\u2019t look like what they wore in the 1930s, but it still has the same kind of function. They identify with the cult of that authoritarian mindset.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b122726d58f9f2a3ce050a22bf5f67f5c369a9d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b122726d58f9f2a3ce050a22bf5f67f5c369a9d1/0_0_3437_2062/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rohinga children in a scene from Ai Weiwei\u2019s VR artwork Omni.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rohinga children in a scene from Ai Weiwei\u2019s VR artwork Omni.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ai Weiwei/Courtesy of Acute Art and the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ai has been left devastated by his time in Germany, where he still has a studio. In 2017, the AFD \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/03/afd-germany-reformed-eu-immigration-parties-europe\">the anti-immigrant, right</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/03/afd-germany-reformed-eu-immigration-parties-europe\">wing populist party with far-right elements</a> \u2013 entered the federal parliament for the first time with 12.6% of the vote, becoming Germany\u2019s biggest opposition party. In 2018, thousands of rightwing extremists took to the streets of Chemnitz, to the east of the country, shouting \u201cForeigners out\u201d and chasing people they believed were refugees. Ai believes the country has become indifferent to the suffering of others, both within Germany and outside. He says it doesn\u2019t care about what is happening in Hong Kong because keeping in with China\u2019s markets is the priority.</p> <p>Is he comparing today\u2019s Germany with Nazi Germany? \u201cFascism is to think one ideology is higher than others and to try to purify that ideology by dismissing other types of thinking. That\u2019s Nazism. And that Nazism perfectly exists in German daily life today.\u201d</p> <p>Then there is his own experience. He mentions the three times he has been thrown out of taxis. There was no overt racism, he says, but he was pretty sure what lay beneath it all. Tell me, I say. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d Ai replies, as he often does. \u201cOn one occasion, there was a strong perfume. I am sensitive to perfume, so I have to take down the window, and they say, \u2018Pull up the window.\u2019 I say, \u2018No, the perfume is too strong.\u2019 And they say, \u2018Just get out of my taxi.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Where was this? \u201cBerlin! Berlin, every time. And another time in a taxi, the driver was listening to music and my phone rings. My mum calls me from China, I have to answer. He says, \u2018Shut off your phone.\u2019 I say, \u2018This is my mum.\u2019 He says, \u2018You have to shut off your phone.\u2019 Then he suddenly braked and me, my son and girlfriend were thrown forward.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7c3b9f163843eddc936b2011b3cf0f28726c40a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c3b9f163843eddc936b2011b3cf0f28726c40a7/0_0_2895_2148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018He was a passionate, romantic fighter.

Perhaps it\u2019s in his blood. His father, the poet Ai Qing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/02/refugee-crisis-human-flow-ai-weiwei-china\">was sent to a labour camp in the countryside</a> for criticising Maoist communism. Ai shows me a photo of the family home \u2013 a cave in the middle of nowhere. \u201cMy family had to live in this black hole for five years.\u201d Ai Qing\u2019s new job was to clean the ditch that served as the village toilet. How did he cope with his change in circumstances? \u201cHe was a man with a big heart, and had great acceptance.\u201d</p> <p>Following Mao\u2019s death in 1976 and after 19 years of manual labour, Ai Qing and the family returned to Beijing. His work was \u201cunbanned\u201d and he regained his prominence. \u201cHe is still considered the number one national poet,\u201d Ai says proudly. \u201cThey call him the people\u2019s poet. He was a really passionate, romantic fighter. A soldier. He always talked about justice, beauty and integrity. He believed in a perfect world. I believe life is a struggle for it.\u201d</p> <p>Ai enrolled in the Beijing Film Academy and studied animation \u2013 one of many courses he failed to complete. He then became one of the first of his generation allowed to study in the US. He was told by his tutor that his drawings lacked heart. He never drew again. (Ai shows me a drawing of a forest he did as a student, which his father used to illustrate a book of poems. It is exceptionally beautiful). He did all sort of jobs to support himself: collecting rubbish, factory work, carpentry, babysitting and barbering.</p> <p>He befriended beat poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/23/allen-ginsberg-howl-poem-film\">Allen Ginsberg</a>, went to the same parties as Andy Warhol, whose work he adored, discovered Marcel Duchamp and dadaism, and began transforming readymade objects into art (including Hanging Man, a homage to Duchamp made from a wire coat hanger).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"335e9bc7cc5e9819052d9837e3b101cc0137346a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/335e9bc7cc5e9819052d9837e3b101cc0137346a/0_0_4760_3193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The installation Forever Bicycles in Rio de Janeiro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The installation Forever Bicycles in Rio de Janeiro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ai returned to Beijing in 1993. Since then there is little he hasn\u2019t done in the name of art, protest and fun \u2013 often in the same work. So we have the 100m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/oct/11/tate-modern-sunflower-seeds-review\">hand-painted porcelain sunflower seeds that </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/oct/11/tate-modern-sunflower-seeds-review\">filled the floor of the Turbine Hall in London\u2019s Tate Modern</a>; the gorgeous <a href=\"https://publicdelivery.org/ai-weiwei-forever-bicycles/\">Forever Bicycles</a> sculpture composed of 1,254 stainless steel bikes; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/feb/18/ai-weiwei-han-urn-smash-miami-art\">Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn</a>, in which he smashes a 2,000-year-old vase. His art delivers social critique as visual puns. With the sunflower seeds he suggests we are all different despite appearances; with the vase he destroys history just as Mao did; and with the bikes he comments on cultural uniformity.</p> <p>Some work is more solemn: a list of names of the 5,219 schoolchildren who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake (obtained from a year\u2019s research); the documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/07/human-flow-review-ai-weiwei-migration-documentary\">Human Flow</a>, in which he visits refugee camps around the world and reflects on man\u2019s inhumanity to man.

      "bodyText": "\u2018When we filmed this,\u201d says Ai Weiwei, \u201cthe elephants didn\u2019t know what to do. Once they were used for labour, and now they have lost their job.\u201d The artist is talking about the groundbreaking documentary he has just made about unemployed logging elephants in Myanmar. You watch the film, shot with 360-degree virtual reality technology, through a special headset. Turn your head slowly and your view gradually changes. Turn your head 180 degrees and the picture changes completely. \u201cWhen they lost their job,\u201d he continues, \u201ceach elephant had a few people to take care of it, so those people also lost their job.\u201d Ai (Weiwei is his first name and means unknown or future) relates to the elephants as readily as he does to the subject of the second part of his VR project \u2013 this one about the lives of Rohingya refugees in a Bangladeshi camp. Rather than showing the suffering in the camp, Ai focuses on moments of joy: we see the wonder of children as the food trucks arrive, the generous portions of meat given out to celebrate Eid, the dazzling school built for the kids. \u201cI feel [there are] a lot of positive things about humanity even in the worst conditions,\u201d Ai says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to show there is just sadness.\u201d The Chinese artist and activist understands loss, displacement and existential danger as well as anybody. And what he wants to talk about today is his personal sense of threat. It\u2019s four months since Ai quit Germany for Britain, and he is adapting quickly to his new home. He orders English breakfast tea and lays into the country that gave him refuge after fleeing China in 2015. Germany is intolerant, bigoted and authoritarian, he says. And he\u2019s barely started. Does he really believe that post-Brexit Britain will prove a haven of tolerance? He smiles and says he\u2019s here primarily for his son. He believes 10-year-old Lao will get a good education in Britain \u2013 and will be safe. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to live in harsh conditions. I don\u2019t think Germany provides a good environment for foreigners.\u201d He mentions that Lao was recently threatened by a shop owner there. While Ai insists he has no illusions about Britain, he still thinks it will be better for his family. \u201cIn Britain they are colonial. They are polite at least. But in Germany, they don\u2019t have this politeness. They would say in Germany you have to speak German. They have been very rude in daily situations. They deeply don\u2019t like foreigners.\u201d If Britain does let him down, he assures me he\u2019ll let us all know. We meet at an upmarket hotel in Cambridge, the city where the 62-year-old now lives. He is dressed in trademark black, head shaved and beard clipped. There is something mesmerising about him: he has the appearance of a bouncer, the manner of a priest and the language of a revolutionary. With the gentlest of voices, he continues to eviscerate Germany. \u201cI don\u2019t like a state or culture that so obeys authority.\u201d Ai has never been one for obeying authority. He slurps his tea and smiles. \u201cGermany is a very precise society. Its people love the comfort of being oppressed. In China, too, you see that. Once you\u2019re used to it, it can be very enjoyable. And you can see the efficiency, the show, the sense of their power being extended through the connected-mind condition.\u201d You mean there is no room for individuality? \u201cYes. They have a different kind of suit: it doesn\u2019t look like what they wore in the 1930s, but it still has the same kind of function. They identify with the cult of that authoritarian mindset.\u201d Ai has been left devastated by his time in Germany, where he still has a studio. In 2017, the AFD \u2013 the anti-immigrant, rightwing populist party with far-right elements \u2013 entered the federal parliament for the first time with 12.6% of the vote, becoming Germany\u2019s biggest opposition party. In 2018, thousands of rightwing extremists took to the streets of Chemnitz, to the east of the country, shouting \u201cForeigners out\u201d and chasing people they believed were refugees. Ai believes the country has become indifferent to the suffering of others, both within Germany and outside. He says it doesn\u2019t care about what is happening in Hong Kong because keeping in with China\u2019s markets is the priority. Is he comparing today\u2019s Germany with Nazi Germany? \u201cFascism is to think one ideology is higher than others and to try to purify that ideology by dismissing other types of thinking. That\u2019s Nazism. And that Nazism perfectly exists in German daily life today.\u201d Then there is his own experience. He mentions the three times he has been thrown out of taxis. There was no overt racism, he says, but he was pretty sure what lay beneath it all. Tell me, I say. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d Ai replies, as he often does. \u201cOn one occasion, there was a strong perfume. I am sensitive to perfume, so I have to take down the window, and they say, \u2018Pull up the window.\u2019 I say, \u2018No, the perfume is too strong.\u2019 And they say, \u2018Just get out of my taxi.\u2019\u201d Where was this? \u201cBerlin! Berlin, every time. And another time in a taxi, the driver was listening to music and my phone rings. My mum calls me from China, I have to answer. He says, \u2018Shut off your phone.\u2019 I say, \u2018This is my mum.\u2019 He says, \u2018You have to shut off your phone.\u2019 Then he suddenly braked and me, my son and girlfriend were thrown forward.\u201d Ai has spent his life fighting for justice. Perhaps it\u2019s in his blood. His father, the poet Ai Qing, was sent to a labour camp in the countryside for criticising Maoist communism. Ai shows me a photo of the family home \u2013 a cave in the middle of nowhere. \u201cMy family had to live in this black hole for five years.\u201d Ai Qing\u2019s new job was to clean the ditch that served as the village toilet. How did he cope with his change in circumstances? \u201cHe was a man with a big heart, and had great acceptance.\u201d Following Mao\u2019s death in 1976 and after 19 years of manual labour, Ai Qing and the family returned to Beijing. His work was \u201cunbanned\u201d and he regained his prominence. \u201cHe is still considered the number one national poet,\u201d Ai says proudly. \u201cThey call him the people\u2019s poet. He was a really passionate, romantic fighter. A soldier. He always talked about justice, beauty and integrity. He believed in a perfect world. I believe life is a struggle for it.\u201d Ai enrolled in the Beijing Film Academy and studied animation \u2013 one of many courses he failed to complete. He then became one of the first of his generation allowed to study in the US. He was told by his tutor that his drawings lacked heart. He never drew again. (Ai shows me a drawing of a forest he did as a student, which his father used to illustrate a book of poems. It is exceptionally beautiful). He did all sort of jobs to support himself: collecting rubbish, factory work, carpentry, babysitting and barbering. He befriended beat poet Allen Ginsberg, went to the same parties as Andy Warhol, whose work he adored, discovered Marcel Duchamp and dadaism, and began transforming readymade objects into art (including Hanging Man, a homage to Duchamp made from a wire coat hanger). Ai returned to Beijing in 1993. Since then there is little he hasn\u2019t done in the name of art, protest and fun \u2013 often in the same work. So we have the 100m hand-painted porcelain sunflower seeds that filled the floor of the Turbine Hall in London\u2019s Tate Modern; the gorgeous Forever Bicycles sculpture composed of 1,254 stainless steel bikes; and Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn, in which he smashes a 2,000-year-old vase. His art delivers social critique as visual puns. With the sunflower seeds he suggests we are all different despite appearances; with the vase he destroys history just as Mao did; and with the bikes he comments on cultural uniformity. Some work is more solemn: a list of names of the 5,219 schoolchildren who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake (obtained from a year\u2019s research); the documentary Human Flow, in which he visits refugee camps around the world and reflects on man\u2019s inhumanity to man. Other work has transformed the landscape \u2013 Ai co-designed the Bird\u2019s Nest, as the 2008 Olympic stadium in Beijing became known, though he has since said he regretted creating such a monument for the state and has never stepped foot inside the finished building. And some work, if it is work at all, is just plain bonkers, such as the joyous video of Ai and his friends dancing Gangnam Style. With the Bird\u2019s Nest, he became famous as a dissident artist and seemed untouchable, protected by his popularity. Then in 2010, he claimed to have been beaten by police while trying to report a previous incident, in which he was punched in the head by a policeman, leading to him suffering a brain haemorrhage. \u201cI was hours away from dying,\u201d he says. That same year, the authorities tore down his government-funded studio. Rather than protesting, he turned the event into a piece of performance art, holding a crab feast to celebrate the act of destruction. (This was another classic Ai pun. He xie, the word for crab, sounds just like \u201charmonious\u201d in Mandarin \u2013 a word used by the government to describe society, and reclaimed by critics to mean censorship.) In 2011, Ai was jailed and told he faced 13 years in prison for subversion of state power, but was released after 81 days and given a $2.4m (\u00a31.5m) fine for tax evasion. The money was raised by supporters worldwide. Ai\u2019s passport was confiscated and he was placed under house arrest for four years. When his passport was returned, he left for Germany, where he had been offered a professorship at Berlin University of the Arts. I ask if he thinks he would have been an artist if he hadn\u2019t grown up in China. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cNo, I would not be an artist because an artist is not something I would have rated as important.

She then added that the right, the left, and the centre of politics had all failed the sustainability test. \u201cNo political ideology or economic structure has managed to tackle the climate and environmental emergency and create a cohesive and sustainable world.\u201d Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cThe 1tn trees initiative didn\u2019t make up for the lack of a wider attack on the climate emergency, and Trump had failed to appreciate the scale of the crisis. \u201cTo assume you can have a great, profitable America, and happy Americans without understanding the risk to Americans from climate change is astounding. It just demonstrates the level of denial, and the capture of this government by the coal, oil and gas industries.\u201d Trump said the American dream was back, \u201cbigger, better and stronger\u201d than before, adding that the benefits of growth were going primarily to low-income workers rather than the better off. Trump added that 7m jobs had been created and 12,000 factories opened during his presidency. Many of the president\u2019s claims were rejected by the Columbia University economics professor Joseph Stiglitz. \u201cResearch shows that Trump normally tells five or six lies a day. He far exceeded that today,\u201d he said, noting that growth had been faster under Barack Obama than it was currently under Trump, and that life expectancy had fallen every year of his presidency. Although the US economy grew far more rapidly in previous decades than it has since he was elected in November 2016, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that the US is in an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen before.\u201d The main hall in Davos, together with an overspill room, were packed to hear the president, although there were some titters as he ran through a litany of boasts. \u201cI hold up the American model as an example to the world,\u201d Trump said, contrasting his record with that of his predecessor, Obama. The US was \u201cthriving, flourishing and winning\u201d unprecedentedly, he added, citing trade deals signed last week with China and Mexico-Canada as models for the 21st century. \u201cI am looking forward to a tremendous new trade deal with the UK,\u201d Trump said, noting that Britain had a \u201cwonderful new prime minister\u201d in Boris Johnson, who was keen on a deal. The president said the economic boom had happened despite the US Federal Reserve, which \u201craised rates too fast and cut them too slowly\u201d.",

It is the latest instalment in a long-running drama that some observers have described as a \u201cgame of thrones\u201d in the poor mountainous kingdom in southern Africa. Investigators hope Thomas Thabane, 80, can cast light on the death of Lipolelo Thabane, who was shot dead two days before his inauguration. The couple had been embroiled in bitter divorce proceedings and the killing of the 58 year old outside her home in the Lesotho capital, Maseru, sent shockwaves through the country. Lipolelo Thabane had reportedly refused to divorce her husband and won a court battle to retain her privileges as the country\u2019s first lady until any formal separation. Thabane remarried two months after the murder. His second wife, Maesaiah, 42, is also sought by the police. The case was brought back into the spotlight this month by a letter from Lesotho\u2019s police chief, which claimed communication records showed that someone at the murder scene had called Thabane\u2019s mobile phone on the day of the crime. The killing had originally been blamed on unknown criminals. Lesotho has one of the highest murder rates in the world. \u201cThis case does not only attract the attention of Basotho nation [Lesotho] but it is of international concern,\u201d the deputy police commissioner, Paseka Mokete, said. Thabane said last week he planned to resign after senior members of the All Basotho Convention party accused him of hampering investigations into the killing. He gave no timetable for when he would be stepping down. He is expected to report to the police on Wednesday and has said he will cooperate with the investigation. \u201cAs the prime minister I have undertaken an oath to respect and protect the constitution and all other laws of Lesotho,\u201d he told reporters in Maseru, promising to \u201cget to the bottom of this matter\u201d. Lesotho has been in political crisis for several months, with Thabane confronting his party and parliament indefinitely suspended. Several high-profile figures have also been summoned to provide information on the case, including Thabane\u2019s second wife. Police have been unable to trace the whereabouts of Maesaiah Thabane since she failed to turn up for questioning on 10 January. A court has since issued a warrant for her arrest.

Always looking at the external appearance rather than the beauty and sensitivity within.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s only a dog. </strong>But it\u2019s a dog that has suffered. Jubilee was bred in the US and abandoned by its breeder, who said no one wanted to buy her because of her idiosyncratic appearance.</p> <p><strong>Idiosyncratic is putting it politely. </strong>You\u2019re not Laurence Fox, are you? Anyway, Jubilee ended up at the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Husky House shelter in New Jersey</a>, where she languished for 18 months because no one wanted her.</p> <p><strong>Probably because Siberian huskies are generally attractive and noble-looking dogs that pull sleds across the Arctic tundra, rather than creatures with a look of permanent surprise that scare small children. </strong>I think I\u2019ll just ignore you and carry on with the story. After getting no interest for 18 months, Husky House hit on the idea of putting the whole saga, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HuskyHouseNJ/posts/10157345027182562\" title=\"\">with pictures, on Facebook</a> in a post from Jubilee.</p> <p><strong>I fear you are about to quote from Jubilee\u2019s missive.</strong> You\u2019re dead right I am. \u201cHuskies are majestic-looking dogs and I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t look like them,\u201d it said. \u201cI wish I was beautiful so someone would want me to be their dog. I love people, but I\u2019m a little shy because people mostly laugh at the way I look. Doesn\u2019t anyone want a funny-looking husky? I wish I had a family of my own who could love me even though I\u2019m not pretty.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Yuk! Typical American schmaltz. No doubt it worked.</strong> Like a dream.

      "bodyText": "Name: Jubilee the cross-eyed Siberian husky. Age: Four. Appearance: Er, unusual. What do you mean? Well, look at the picture. The dog is cross-eyed. We prefer to say wide-eyed. It does look weird. That\u2019s the trouble with conventional people like you. Always looking at the external appearance rather than the beauty and sensitivity within. It\u2019s only a dog. But it\u2019s a dog that has suffered. Jubilee was bred in the US and abandoned by its breeder, who said no one wanted to buy her because of her idiosyncratic appearance. Idiosyncratic is putting it politely. You\u2019re not Laurence Fox, are you? Anyway, Jubilee ended up at the Husky House shelter in New Jersey, where she languished for 18 months because no one wanted her. Probably because Siberian huskies are generally attractive and noble-looking dogs that pull sleds across the Arctic tundra, rather than creatures with a look of permanent surprise that scare small children. I think I\u2019ll just ignore you and carry on with the story. After getting no interest for 18 months, Husky House hit on the idea of putting the whole saga, with pictures, on Facebook in a post from Jubilee. I fear you are about to quote from Jubilee\u2019s missive. You\u2019re dead right I am. \u201cHuskies are majestic-looking dogs and I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t look like them,\u201d it said. \u201cI wish I was beautiful so someone would want me to be their dog. I love people, but I\u2019m a little shy because people mostly laugh at the way I look. Doesn\u2019t anyone want a funny-looking husky? I wish I had a family of my own who could love me even though I\u2019m not pretty.\u201d Yuk! Typical American schmaltz. No doubt it worked. Like a dream. The post went viral and more than 150 people applied to adopt Jubilee. \u201cWe received an overwhelming amount of love, support and inquiries,\u201d said a spokesperson from the shelter. \u201cWe are so happy to see that everyone feels she is as wonderful as we always knew she was.\u201d Presumably she is now happily housed and we can all move on? Jubilee has found what Husky House calls her \u201cforever home\u201d with a family that has two other \u201cfur siblings\u201d and has previously adopted from the shelter. Forever home, fur siblings \u2026 I think I\u2019m going to be sick. Jubilee\u2019s plight has produced some handy publicity for Husky House, which has even produced a \u201cTeam Jubilee\u201d T-shirt, a snip at $25. American capitalism lives on! I\u2019ll order two. I quite like the fact the shelter is cashing in. Funny. I had a feeling you would. Not to be confused with: Clarence the cross-eyed lion in the 60s TV show Daktari.

With the aftershocks of the civil war manifesting in bloody voter suppression and racially motivated terrorism across the South, Johnson\u2019s presidency was immediately thrown into tumult by demands that the new president take steps to cement the war\u2019s promise of racial equality.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump is on the precipice of becoming the third president in US history to be impeached. It\u2019s an exclusive club that no one wants to join \u2013 but who else is in it, and why? Here\u2019s a look back at the two prior impeachments and a third near-miss case. Impeachment #1: Andrew Johnson (1868) The assassination of Abraham Lincoln in April 1865 unexpectedly elevated his vice-president, Johnson, an outspoken white supremacist but strong anti-secessionist, to the White House. With the aftershocks of the civil war manifesting in bloody voter suppression and racially motivated terrorism across the South, Johnson\u2019s presidency was immediately thrown into tumult by demands that the new president take steps to cement the war\u2019s promise of racial equality. But Johnson vetoed civil rights legislation, unilaterally pardoned hundreds of former Confederate leaders and called for the murder of his political enemies. Johnson was in essence impeached for undermining the cause of racial equality, the historian Brenda Wineapple wrote in her book The Impeachers. But the bulk of the impeachment clauses against him were predicated on a relatively narrow charge of violating a contemporary \u201ctenure of office\u201d law (repealed soon thereafter) by removing his secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, who was instrumental in opposing racist attacks on suffrage for former slaves. Johnson remained in office after being acquitted in the Senate by one vote \u2013 a bribed victory, historians have speculated. Impeachment #2: Bill Clinton (1998) While the Clinton impeachment is linked in popular memory to his relationship with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky, he was impeached for lying to a grand jury in a separate case, brought by a former Arkansas state employee, Paula Jones. In response to a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Jones, Clinton denied in a sworn deposition and a later video interview that he had a sexual relationship with Lewinsky. That assertion was contradicted by a report submitted to Congress by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who documented Clinton\u2019s relationship with Lewinsky in lurid detail. Impeachment proceedings against Clinton were opened in October 1998, and the House of Representatives approved two articles of impeachment against him, for perjury and obstruction of justice, in December. Two other proposed articles \u2013 for abuse of power and perjury a second time \u2013 were voted down. The Republican-led Senate \u2013 stronger than today\u2019s, with a 55-seat majority at the time \u2013 acquitted Clinton easily on both counts, with the closer case drawing only 50 votes out of 67 needed. Near-miss: Richard Nixon (1974) In November 1972, Nixon won re-election by what was then the largest margin of victory in the history of US presidential elections. But five months earlier, a burglary at Democratic offices in the Watergate hotel complex had set in motion a chain of events that would end his presidency. In his investigation of the burglaries, special prosecutor Archibald Cox uncovered a dirty campaign to attack Nixon\u2019s political opponents, financed by a secret slush fund and directed by Nixon himself. For months, Nixon publicly denied all involvement. But an impeachment inquiry was opened in October 1973, after Nixon fired the top two officials in the justice department for their refusal to fire Cox. A fight over evidence ensued, including tapes of Nixon\u2019s Oval Office conversations. In late July 1974, a third of elected Republicans on the House judiciary committee joined Democrats to approve three articles of impeachment, for obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress. The release of a \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape a week later, fixing Nixon at the center of the conspiracy, sealed the president\u2019s fate. Under pressure from fellow Republicans, Nixon resigned on 9 August 1974, before the full House could vote on impeachment.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump Democrats announced an official impeachment inquiry into Trump on 24 September following a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about Trump\u2019s interactions with the president of Ukraine. A White House summary of a 25 July call shows Trump pressed Volodymyr Zelenskiy to work with the US attorney general and Rudy Giuliani, to investigate his political rival Joe Biden in the run-up the 2020 US election. Trump told Zelenskiy to look into unfounded and debunked allegations that Biden helped remove a Ukrainian prosecutor who investigated a company tied to his son Hunter. Volodymyr Zelenskiy Ukraine\u2019s new president was a wildcard candidate who had no experience of politics save for playing the president in a TV comedy. In a remarkable plot twist, he\u2019s now been thrust into the centre of an American political scandal. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be involved in democratic elections of the USA,\u201d Zelenskiy said in September, visibly embarrassed after the release of the summary. \u201cWe had a good phone call. It was normal. You read it. Nobody pushed me.\u201d Joe Biden Currently a strong candidate in the 2020 race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Biden was vice-president in 2016, when the Obama administration pressured Ukraine to remove Viktor Shokin, the country\u2019s top prosecutor: the US and other western countries said Shokin was corrupt. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden. \u201cThis is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It is a national security issue,\u201d Biden said. Hunter Biden Joe Biden\u2019s second son served on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas producer, from 2014 to 2019. Burisma had been investigated by Shokin for alleged corruption, but the investigation had been dropped by the time the US government urged Ukraine to fire Shokin. Viktor Shokin The former Ukrainian prosecutor general was widely seen as having blocked the prosecutions of corrupt oligarchs. Reform-minded Ukrainian politicians and international partners pressured the Ukrainian government to remove him for some time, and he was finally dismissed in 2016. He was later reinvented as a kind of heroic victim by Giuliani, who claimed \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that Shokin was fired on Biden\u2019s orders. Rudy Giuliani The former mayor of New York is Trump\u2019s personal attorney, most strident TV defender and, it seems, an occasional diplomat. The rough transcript of the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call shows Trump telling the Ukraine president to work with Giuliani in investigating Joe Biden. Trump also repeatedly told US officials running Ukraine policy to \u201ctalk to Rudy\u201d, they said. But US officials testified they were alarmed by Giuliani\u2019s role, which included a campaign against ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. William \u2018Bill\u2019 Barr The attorney general is named by Trump in the call with Zelenskiy, the president saying Zelenskiy should work with Barr to investigate a conspiracy theory blaming Ukraine, instead of Russia, for 2016 election tampering. The Department of Justice, which Barr oversees, said Trump had not asked Barr to work with Ukraine. The DoJ examined the Trump-Zelenskiy call but decided not to open an investigation \u2013 a decision which has been criticized by legal analysts. The whistleblower The anonymous author of a detailed complaint in mid-August that set the impeachment inquiry in motion, warning that Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election\u201d. The account has been corroborated by witness testimony and public statements by Republicans. Yet Trump, in an apparent attempt to deflect attention from his alleged misconduct, has led a campaign to unveil the whistleblower, whose identity is purportedly protected by federal law. Kurt Volker The former US special envoy to Ukraine resigned from the state department and met with congressional investigators, turning over records of WhatsApp chats in which he and other US diplomats worked to arrange a deal between Zelenskiy and Trump in which Trump would invite Zelenskiy to the White House and Zelenskiy would make a public statement that Ukraine had opened investigations of Burisma and election tampering. \u201cI think Potus really wants the deliverable,\u201d Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, said on the chats. Gordon Sondland A wealthy hotelier, Trump mega-donor and now US ambassador to the European Union. In the chats turned over by Volker, Sondland, whose usual portfolio does not include Ukraine, pushed Volker and a third diplomat, Bill Taylor, to get what Trump wanted from Zelenskiy. In closed-door testimony, Sondland initially said he took Trump at his word that there \u201cwas no quid pro quo\u201d. Sondland later revised his testimony, saying, \u201cI now recall speaking individually with [Zelenskiy aide Andriy] Yermak, where I said that resumption of US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.\u201d William \u2018Bill\u2019 Taylor A public servant for 50 years, the former military officer was appointed ambassador to Ukraine by George W Bush and asked by Trump to take charge of the embassy in Kyiv. Taylor delivered testimony in October seen as devastating. He described how diplomats and Giuliani pursued Trump\u2019s demand that Zelenskiy go on CNN and announce of investigation of Biden. Taylor said Sondland told him that both military aid and a White House visit \u2013 \u201ceverything\u201d \u2013 hinged on Zelenskiy\u2019s willingness to announce the investigation.In the chats, Taylor repeatedly expressed alarm about the deal Sondland was trying to put together. \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor wrote. Taylor was scheduled to be the first witness to testify in public hearings. George P Kent A deputy assistant secretary of state, Kent was nominally in charge of Ukraine policy \u2013 until Trump reportedly put Giuliani and his EU ambassador in charge instead. Kent testified that Trump wanted to hear three words out of the Ukrainian president\u2019s mouth: \u201cinvestigations\u201d, \u201cBiden\u201d and \u201cClinton\u201d. Kent described his outrage over the plot to destroy the career of ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, which he attributed to \u201ctwo snake pits\u201d in Ukraine and the US. \u201cI was told to keep my head down,\u201d he said, \u201cand lower my profile in Ukraine.\u201d Kent was scheduled to be the second witness to testify in public hearings. Marie Yovanovitch Yovanovitch was US ambassador to Ukraine for almost three years before being unexpectedly recalled by Trump in May this year. US officials have described a plot \u2013 successful, it turned out \u2013 by her political enemies in Ukraine to destroy her ambassadorship. Trump criticized Yovanovitch in his call with Zelenskiy, saying, \u201cWell, she\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it meant,\u201d said Yovanovitch. \u201cI was very concerned. I still am.\u201d In March, Yovanovitch called on Ukraine to do more to address corruption. Then Ukraine prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko accused Yovanovitch of giving Ukraine \u201ca list of people whom we should not prosecute\u201d. Lutsenko has since said Yovanovitch did not give him such a list. Yovanovitch was scheduled to be the third witness to testify in public hearings. Joseph Maguire The acting director of national intelligence only took on the role on 16 August. Maguire has been criticized for not sharing the whistleblower\u2019s complaint with Congress \u2013 as is normal procedure. The acting director said he thought issues raised in the complaint might be covered by executive privilege, and said he consulted with officials at the justice department and White House lawyers over whether to pass the complaint to Congress. The White House eventually published the complaint. Michael Atkinson After receiving the complaint, Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, recommended it be shared with Congress. This put Atkinson at odds with his superior, Maguire, who blocked it from being shared. While the complaint was being withheld, Atkinson alerted lawmakers to its existence, saying it raised issues of \u201curgent concern\u201d. Nancy Pelosi The speaker of the House, and the most powerful woman in Congress, Pelosi decided to initiate an impeachment inquiry after the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelenskiy call was published. In doing so, Pelosi succumbed to long-mounting pressure from Democratic members of Congress, some of whom had been pushing for an impeachment inquiry to begin for more than a year. Yuriy Lutsenko A veteran on the political scene, Lutsenko replaced Shokin as Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general but was also viewed with suspicion by reformers. Lutsenko met Giuliani and appears to have been amenable to opening an investigation into unsubstantiated claims of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election on behalf of the Democrats. Ukrainian officials have denied any effort to help Hillary Clinton in the election. Serhiy Leshchenko One of the new brand of politicians who entered the scene after Ukraine\u2019s Maidan revolution, Leshchenko was a leading political journalist who wrote widely on corruption and became an MP. In May 2016, he published information from a so-called \u201cblack ledger\u201d that showed under-the-table payments from the pro-Russian former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s regime to figures including Trump\u2019s then campaign manager Paul Manafort.

      "bodyText": "Many antibiotics are unavailable in poorer countries despite higher infection rates, exacerbating the threat of drug-resistant superbugs, according to a report to be presented to world leaders and the bosses of top pharmaceutical companies in Davos. The report, released by the Access to Medicine Foundation, an Amsterdam-based non-profit group, also shows that the number of new treatments being developed for common infectious diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and gonorrhoea has fallen. Common infections have become increasingly harder to treat globally. In 2018, a British man was the first person in the world to be diagnosed with a strain of gonorrhoea resistant to all antibiotics normally used to treat the disease. In less wealthy countries, when the best antibiotics are unavailable, doctors are often forced to use inferior drugs or delay treatment, leading to the rise of drug-resistant bacteria. In Brazil, Indonesia and Russia, 40-60% of infections are caused by superbugs. In India, the proportion rises to more than 70% for several common bacteria. The study, which assesses 30 of the world\u2019s top drugmakers on their efforts to address drug-resistant infections, was funded by UK Aid and the Dutch ministry of health. Poorer countries have rising rates of drug-resistance as they struggle to access effective treatments. The report found that, of 13 newly developed antibiotics, only three are available in 10 or more of the world\u2019s 102 low- and middle-income countries. However, many older, off-patent antibiotics that are still effective are also unavailable: of 24 such \u201cforgotten\u201d antibiotics, only 14 are supplied to poorer countries. More people die from a lack of access to medicine than from drug resistance, the report says. A total of 138 vaccines or drugs are in development worldwide targeting 18 bacterial and fungal infections, down from 175 projects two years ago. However, 51 are in late-stage clinical trials, compared with 40 in 2018. This is a cause for concern, says the Access to Medicine Foundation. Because of the low profitability of antibiotics, just a handful of pharmaceutical companies are developing and manufacturing them, led by the UK\u2019s GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which is developing almost a fifth of all projects, along with US firms Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Japan\u2019s Shionogi and Otsuka. Since 2018, two more companies \u2013 Switzerland\u2019s Novartis and France\u2019s Sanofi \u2013 have retreated from developing new antibiotics, while two US companies \u2013 Achaogen and Melinta \u2013 have filed for bankruptcy. Drugs in late-stage clinical trials include treatments from GSK for tuberculosis and gonorrhoea, and a medicine from Johnson &amp; Johnson for drug-resistant tuberculosis in adolescents. Among smaller firms, the Massachusetts-based antibiotics developer Entasis, which was spun off from AstraZeneca in 2015, leads on research. It is developing four medicines that target bacteria in the highest threat category defined by the World Health Organisation such as A baumannii, which can cause pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Moreover, more companies are taking steps to reduce the risk of overselling antibiotics and antifungal medicines to doctors, and Pfizer has become the first company to publicly share its data on drug resistance from its surveillance programmes. Jayasree Iyer, executive director of the Access to Medicine Foundation, stressed the need for companies and public sector organisations to work together to combat the rise of superbugs, and held up a subscription-based \u201cNetflix model\u201d as a way of spurring on drugmakers to invest more in new treatments. The UK government revealed in July an NHS project to test a subscription-style model that offers pharmaceutical companies upfront payment for an unlimited supply of drugs over a certain time period, rather than payment based on the volume of drugs sold, as is currently the case.

Still, Huang\u2019s mother was not tested for the mystery illness, nor quarantined from other patients.</p> \n<p>On 14 January she took a turn for the worse and was slipping in and out of consciousness. A CT scan showed her lungs covered in white nodules. The next evening, Huang\u2019s brother and father watched her die. The official cause of death was severe pneumonia.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000.

There had been reports of a strange new virus with similar symptoms, and the hospital staff were dressed in full hazmat suits. Still, Huang\u2019s mother was not tested for the mystery illness, nor quarantined from other patients. On 14 January she took a turn for the worse and was slipping in and out of consciousness. A CT scan showed her lungs covered in white nodules. The next evening, Huang\u2019s brother and father watched her die. The official cause of death was severe pneumonia. Two doctors told the family privately that she had probably contracted the virus, but provided no documentation. The hospital pressured the family to immediately cremate Huang\u2019s mother, but they refused, asking for more information. A few days later, they relented and workers from a funeral home, also in protective clothing, retrieved, cremated and buried her within a few hours, leaving the family no time to say goodbye. Afterwards, the staff disinfected the van they had travelled in and threw away their hazmat suits. \u201cMy mother\u2019s death was dealt with without any dignity,\u201d said Huang, 40, who did not want to give his or his mother\u2019s full name. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t even counted as a number on the government\u2019s list,\u201d he said, referring to the six people authorities say have been killed by the virus.

The number of confirmed infections is likely to have been underestimated, according to international public health experts, who say there could be as many as 1,700 cases.

Most likely the Carabao Cup. \u201cWe need less games, less competitions, less games,\u201d Guardiola said. That should have been fewer, or course, but this is not the time to be picking up a non-native English speaker on his grammar.

Let us not forget also that when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/05/liverpool-everton-fa-cup-third-round-match-report\" title=\"\">Klopp played his youth team in the FA Cup</a> against Everton, he lost one of the few senior players on the pitch after six minutes when James Milner suffered a hamstring injury.</p> <p>Klopp always maintains that his first duty is to look after his players, not the fans, the television companies or the game\u2019s administrators, and Guardiola would doubtless say the same.

      "bodyText": "When J\u00fcrgen Klopp was asked last week for his thoughts on the Africa Cup of Nations being moved to January next year he spoke uninterrupted for almost eight minutes, detailing his dissatisfaction with the burden on players and clubs and the complete lack of meaningful response from anyone in charge of the game when managers complained of the dangers of trying to cram too much into an already crowded fixture list. A few days later when Pep Guardiola was asked for his views on fixture congestion, bearing in mind that Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford had been sidelined long term, almost certainly as a result of playing too many games in too short a space of time, the Manchester City manager was ready with a plan of action. Scrap a competition, was the gist of his reply. Most likely the Carabao Cup. \u201cWe need less games, less competitions, less games,\u201d Guardiola said. That should have been fewer, or course, but this is not the time to be picking up a non-native English speaker on his grammar. What Guardiola said next was spot on. \u201cPeople can live without football for a while. It\u2019s too much.\u201d While sympathy for the very top clubs is often tempered by their tendency to take part in ill-conceived money-spinners such as next year\u2019s 24-team Club World Cup in China, the injuries to Kane and Rashford are real. Let us not forget also that when Klopp played his youth team in the FA Cup against Everton, he lost one of the few senior players on the pitch after six minutes when James Milner suffered a hamstring injury. Klopp always maintains that his first duty is to look after his players, not the fans, the television companies or the game\u2019s administrators, and Guardiola would doubtless say the same. Coming from abroad, as those managers do, it is probably easy to identify the English problem as one cup competition too many. Most leagues around Europe are not quite as big as the English professional pyramid, and most have one main cup knockout. The question now is whether English clubs and supporters can agree on the same thing. The problem here is that over the last quarter of a century or so, since the arrival of the Premier League and the gradual expansion of the Champions League into something involving four or five English clubs, priorities have changed at the top end of the game and the appeal of the cup competitions has become relatively niche and minor.

In the previous year more than 85,000 women between 25 and 34 years old found employment, representing about a quarter of the annual increase.</p> <p>The figures from the Office for National Statistics appeared to show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/27/uk-employment-levels-brexit-stalling-investment\">a slowdown in job creation</a> over recent months had turned a corner.</p> <p>Signs of weakness in the jobs market prompted two of the nine-member committee of Bank of England interest-rate setters to vote for a cut to borrowing costs at the end of last year.</p> <p>Three others including the governor, Mark Carney, have said a further deterioration in the economy could persuade them to vote for a rate cut from 0.75% currently. The Bank is due to announce its decision on 30 January.</p> <p>Wages growth stagnated at 3.2%, unchanged from the previous period and down from 3.9% in May to July, which was the highest since the 2008 crisis.</p> <p>Pay including bonuses dropped to 3.4% from 3.5%, the ONS said. Unemployment remained at a 45-year low of 3.8%.</p> <p>A reliance on self-employment to bolster jobs growth also waned. However, an increase in the number of self-employed workers over the previous year of 145,000 took the total to a record 5 million people and 15.2% of the workforce. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/10/uk-employers-pause-job-hiring-demand-falls-seven-year-low\">Vacancies also fell</a>, down 11,000 to 805,000 and more than 49,000 fewer than a year ago.</p> <p>A statistician at the ONS, David Freeman, said: \u201cWhile pay growth has eased since last summer, with inflation remaining subdued, earnings are continuing to increase in real terms.\u201d</p> <p>Karen Ward, an economist at JP Morgan Asset Management, said the employment gains should be enough to deter the Bank of England from raising rates. She said the \u201csizeable fiscal stimulus in the pipeline meant the jobs market would come under increasing pressure from rising wages again\u201d.</p> <p>However, the TUC general secretary said weaker wages growth in recent months meant the Treasury should focus on ways to improve living standards in the March budget.</p> <p>\u201cThe long-promised return to healthy pay growth still hasn\u2019t happened and working families are being forced into the red to get by,\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady said. \u201cNo more excuses: the government needs a plan to boost workers\u2019 pay and living standards.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The official data represented a snapshot of the economy before the election on 12 December. John Philpott, a labour market analyst and the director of the Jobs Economist, said the latest figures represented a surprising jobs surge that exceeded expectations.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, the jobs surge has made no difference to wage pressure. This combination of employment and pay figures presents Bank of England interest-rate setters with a dilemma,\u201d he said. \u201cHawks will see the jobs surge as a signal to be cautious about a possible rate cut, whereas doves will point to slower wage growth as evidence that the economy needs a cut.</p> <p>\u201cAll, however, may be concerned by the hidden message in these figures: a jobs surge in a stagnant economy means even weaker labour productivity, highlighting a threat to long-term sustainable growth.\u201d</p> <p>Gerwyn Davies, a senior labour market analyst at the HR body the CIPD, said the rise in 25- to 34-year-old women was probably a result of changes to childcare subsidies and the demand for workers attracting people previously considered economically inactive.</p> <p>\u201cThe big winners to emerge have been women aged between 25 and 34. This suggests the government\u2019s enhanced childcare offering may be working in tandem with the tightening labour market, which is nudging more employers to offer flexible working arrangements,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s jobs market staged a stronger than expected recovery in the three months to November, according to official figures, easing pressure on Bank of England policymakers to cut interest rates at their meeting next week. The number of people in employment jumped by 208,000 over the period to a joint record high of 32.9 million, nearly double the 110,000 increase forecast by economists. A surge in the number of younger women joining the labour market accounted for much of the rise. In the previous year more than 85,000 women between 25 and 34 years old found employment, representing about a quarter of the annual increase. The figures from the Office for National Statistics appeared to show a slowdown in job creation over recent months had turned a corner. Signs of weakness in the jobs market prompted two of the nine-member committee of Bank of England interest-rate setters to vote for a cut to borrowing costs at the end of last year. Three others including the governor, Mark Carney, have said a further deterioration in the economy could persuade them to vote for a rate cut from 0.75% currently. The Bank is due to announce its decision on 30 January. Wages growth stagnated at 3.2%, unchanged from the previous period and down from 3.9% in May to July, which was the highest since the 2008 crisis. Pay including bonuses dropped to 3.4% from 3.5%, the ONS said. Unemployment remained at a 45-year low of 3.8%. A reliance on self-employment to bolster jobs growth also waned. However, an increase in the number of self-employed workers over the previous year of 145,000 took the total to a record 5 million people and 15.2% of the workforce. Vacancies also fell, down 11,000 to 805,000 and more than 49,000 fewer than a year ago. A statistician at the ONS, David Freeman, said: \u201cWhile pay growth has eased since last summer, with inflation remaining subdued, earnings are continuing to increase in real terms.\u201d Karen Ward, an economist at JP Morgan Asset Management, said the employment gains should be enough to deter the Bank of England from raising rates. She said the \u201csizeable fiscal stimulus in the pipeline meant the jobs market would come under increasing pressure from rising wages again\u201d. However, the TUC general secretary said weaker wages growth in recent months meant the Treasury should focus on ways to improve living standards in the March budget. \u201cThe long-promised return to healthy pay growth still hasn\u2019t happened and working families are being forced into the red to get by,\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady said. \u201cNo more excuses: the government needs a plan to boost workers\u2019 pay and living standards.\u201d The official data represented a snapshot of the economy before the election on 12 December. John Philpott, a labour market analyst and the director of the Jobs Economist, said the latest figures represented a surprising jobs surge that exceeded expectations. \u201cHowever, the jobs surge has made no difference to wage pressure. This combination of employment and pay figures presents Bank of England interest-rate setters with a dilemma,\u201d he said. \u201cHawks will see the jobs surge as a signal to be cautious about a possible rate cut, whereas doves will point to slower wage growth as evidence that the economy needs a cut. \u201cAll, however, may be concerned by the hidden message in these figures: a jobs surge in a stagnant economy means even weaker labour productivity, highlighting a threat to long-term sustainable growth.\u201d Gerwyn Davies, a senior labour market analyst at the HR body the CIPD, said the rise in 25- to 34-year-old women was probably a result of changes to childcare subsidies and the demand for workers attracting people previously considered economically inactive. \u201cThe big winners to emerge have been women aged between 25 and 34. This suggests the government\u2019s enhanced childcare offering may be working in tandem with the tightening labour market, which is nudging more employers to offer flexible working arrangements,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a historical fact that the Biafran war lasted from 1967 until 1970. But like all apparently objective historical facts, this one feels more subjective the more you look at it. For whom, exactly, did the war end? Active hostilities may have ended on 15 January 1970, but politically, Biafran independence remains a fraught question. Meanwhile, one of war\u2019s tragedies is always that it never really ends for those who survive. Ceasefires cannot erase scars, loss or memories.</p> <p>This lack of closure must have presented a challenge for Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie as she wrote Half of a Yellow Sun. On the one hand, there\u2019s the natural breaking-off point at the declaration of peace. On the other, there\u2019s the knowledge that to accurately represent the experience of her characters is to acknowledge the fact that they can never really leave their suffering behind.</p> <p>Those dates provide a further set of issues for readers. The knowledge that there must be some kind of end in sight kept me able to turn the pages during the harrowing descriptions of starvation and military brutality. But the probability that not all the characters would survive induced a certain amount of trepidation. Adichie wasn\u2019t writing a fairy story. </p> <p>The decisions she made in navigating these difficult waters say a lot about her writing.</p> <p>In conventional dramatic terms, the character you might think is most likely to die is Ugwu. Almost as soon as war breaks out, he has a sword of Damocles hanging over him. He is the right age to be forced into the military \u2013 and also easily daft enough to wander on to the streets where the press gangs are likely to catch him. This latter quality makes you dread his fate.</p> <p>As well as making him an admirable, tender character, notable for his academic ability as much as his eagerness to fall in love, Adichie makes Ugwu the main focus for comedy in the novel. He is prone to doing absurd things like sleeping with chicken bones in his pockets and delighting in the sound of his master calling him an \u201cignoramus\u201d \u2013 and this also makes him feel like a good potential victim.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a historical fact that the Biafran war lasted from 1967 until 1970. But like all apparently objective historical facts, this one feels more subjective the more you look at it. For whom, exactly, did the war end? Active hostilities may have ended on 15 January 1970, but politically, Biafran independence remains a fraught question. Meanwhile, one of war\u2019s tragedies is always that it never really ends for those who survive. Ceasefires cannot erase scars, loss or memories. This lack of closure must have presented a challenge for Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie as she wrote Half of a Yellow Sun. On the one hand, there\u2019s the natural breaking-off point at the declaration of peace. On the other, there\u2019s the knowledge that to accurately represent the experience of her characters is to acknowledge the fact that they can never really leave their suffering behind. Those dates provide a further set of issues for readers. The knowledge that there must be some kind of end in sight kept me able to turn the pages during the harrowing descriptions of starvation and military brutality. But the probability that not all the characters would survive induced a certain amount of trepidation. Adichie wasn\u2019t writing a fairy story. The decisions she made in navigating these difficult waters say a lot about her writing. In conventional dramatic terms, the character you might think is most likely to die is Ugwu. Almost as soon as war breaks out, he has a sword of Damocles hanging over him. He is the right age to be forced into the military \u2013 and also easily daft enough to wander on to the streets where the press gangs are likely to catch him. This latter quality makes you dread his fate. As well as making him an admirable, tender character, notable for his academic ability as much as his eagerness to fall in love, Adichie makes Ugwu the main focus for comedy in the novel. He is prone to doing absurd things like sleeping with chicken bones in his pockets and delighting in the sound of his master calling him an \u201cignoramus\u201d \u2013 and this also makes him feel like a good potential victim. It\u2019s often the comic relief and the lovable rogue who has to die. Think of Four Weddings and a Funeral. You don\u2019t have to progress much beyond the first wedding to realise that the funeral will be held for Simon Callow\u2019s sweary, wacky-dancing Gareth. But Half of a Yellow Sun isn\u2019t that predictable. The usual dramatic arc is disrupted when Ugwu, having finally been forced into the army, is involved in a gang rape. He is no longer the adorable innocent we expect to love and lose. Now it even starts to feel like death may be a way for him to escape his burden of guilt. I know I had mixed feelings when the report came back to Ugwu\u2019s employers that he had died. And more again when it was revealed that this report was wrong and Ugwu was in hospital. Still more complicated is the question of what happens to Kainene \u2013 and what to make of that loss. In the end it\u2019s this character, who has always seemed the cleverest, the wittiest and the strongest, who doesn\u2019t make it home. One day, she sets off to try to trade across enemy lines \u2013 and that\u2019s the last anyone sees or hears of her. Rationally and emotionally, we know she must be dead.

They do not include long journeys within countries, which are becoming more frequent due to a trend that has seen smaller slaughterhouses close down.</p>\n    <p>We\u2019re taking a moment to focus on some of the implications of&nbsp;this global trade.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jeroen Dewulf, a veterinarian at Ghent University in Belgium, said the introduction of the African swine fever virus (ASF) into Belgium had almost certainly been caused by human interference: either through imported contaminated animal products or by illegal movements of wild boar.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are several drivers of spreading diseases, but live animals are the largest source of infection,\u201d Dewulf said. \u201cThe more you are going to move animals, the more you run the risk that diseases will be spread through these animals. There are other routes, the virus can be transmitted in meat products for example, but it\u2019s much more efficient to transmit via live animals.\u201d</p> \n<p> David McIver, a senior scientist and epidemiologist at biotech company Metabiota, said the rise in live animal exports was a growing issue for many other diseases, such as avian influenza virus, mad cow disease and Nipah virus, while he warned that ASF could one day feasibly threaten humans in some form.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe first case of Nipah virus in 1998 came after an outbreak in Malaysia following the expansion of pig farming in pristine rainforest areas,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cBats were eating fruit, they dropped it with their saliva on it, it was eaten by pigs, then it gets into humans and there were 105 deaths.

      "bodyText": "The growth of the live animal export trade will make the spread of diseases more likely, experts have warned. Almost 30% more pigs, goats, cows and sheep were shipped, flown and driven across the world in 2017 than a decade earlier, according to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization. The figure is set to rise further, partly because it is still often cheaper to move live animals than use refrigerated transport, despite advances in technology. Consumer demand for fresh meat is also rising as the global population approaches 8 billion, including many who are increasingly adopting diets rich in meat. But transporting live animals around the world increases the risk of disease transmission, according to veterinarians and epidemiologists who fear the growing industry may have already caused viruses to spread. Jeroen Dewulf, a veterinarian at Ghent University in Belgium, said the introduction of the African swine fever virus (ASF) into Belgium had almost certainly been caused by human interference: either through imported contaminated animal products or by illegal movements of wild boar. \u201cThere are several drivers of spreading diseases, but live animals are the largest source of infection,\u201d Dewulf said. \u201cThe more you are going to move animals, the more you run the risk that diseases will be spread through these animals. There are other routes, the virus can be transmitted in meat products for example, but it\u2019s much more efficient to transmit via live animals.\u201d David McIver, a senior scientist and epidemiologist at biotech company Metabiota, said the rise in live animal exports was a growing issue for many other diseases, such as avian influenza virus, mad cow disease and Nipah virus, while he warned that ASF could one day feasibly threaten humans in some form. \u201cThe first case of Nipah virus in 1998 came after an outbreak in Malaysia following the expansion of pig farming in pristine rainforest areas,\u201d he said. \u201cBats were eating fruit, they dropped it with their saliva on it, it was eaten by pigs, then it gets into humans and there were 105 deaths. Tons of swine had to be culled to get the outbreak under control. If we\u2019re exporting those animals around the world we\u2019re potentially moving unknown pathogens to new places.\u201d In another well-known case, British live cattle exports, as well as those of beef products, were banned in the 1990s due to the fear of spreading bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow disease. It is believed that variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare, fatal brain disorder, is likely to be caused by people ingesting meat contaminated with mad cow disease.

      "body": "<p>Heston Blumenthal doesn\u2019t stop talking. At speed. His thoughts veer off in a thousand directions, seemingly simultaneously. \u201cQuestion everything\u201d is the motto the chef plumped for on the coat of arms he was granted a few years back, and he does just that: our conversation takes in Newton, Darwin, Homer, Harry Potter, the Bible, the Qu\u2019ran, the invention of the telephone, the invention of social media, breathing, Jaws and saws.</p> <p>The violence of the last two make me blink. Having spoken out in 2015 about TV becoming \u201ctoo formulaic\u201d and subsequently disappearing from our screens, Blumenthal likens the need to take a step back to the scene in Jaws where Roy Scheider is on the beach and hears a scream in the water, as the camera simultaneously zooms out and moves in. He segues swiftly into another metaphor, of a carpenter sawing away with an ever-blunter implement. \u201cHe should stop and have a rest,\u201d he says, \u201cresharpen his saw and start again. But when you\u2019re in the middle of it, you think \u2018I can\u2019t stop, I don\u2019t have time.\u2019\u201d Is this a sign of the culinary wizard coming back an even more intense character? Or perhaps he\u2019s just bringing the drama he\u2019s famous for in the kitchen to our conversation. \u201cI have some funny metaphors I still need to work on,\u201d he concedes.</p> <p>In any case, Blumenthal is very much back. This week, the man famous for serving up giant lit candles, \u2018dismembered corpses\u2019 and edible icebergs as food returns to television as one of the \u201ckitchen gods\u201d on Channel 4\u2019s super-kitsch new cooking show, Crazy Delicious. Styled like a cross between Willy Wonka\u2019s garden and the My Little Pony universe, Crazy Delicious is all puffy clouds and cherry blossom, babbling brooks and blue skies. Crucially, it is TV\u2019s first entirely edible set \u2013 just the thing to bring Blumenthal out of his hiatus.</p> <p>In each episode, three intrepid home cooks are let loose in the fairytale garden to go forth and forage. With their haul, they compete in three tasks, presenting their spectacular, offbeat creations to Blumenthal and his cronies \u2013 American soul-food big-hitter Carla Hall and Michelin-starred Swedish fire-pit master Niklas Ekstedt \u2013 to compete for the golden apple.</p> <p>\u201cIt taps right into my heart, my blood, my culinary DNA,\u201d says Blumenthal. The challenge he has always embraced, he says, is to make things that taste as good as they look, while being at odds with exactly <em>what</em> they look like. Doing it all in chocolate would be too easy. Instead, unleashing wild creativity \u2013 travelling to the outer rim of Bake Off, so to speak \u2013 is what he\u2019s all about.</p> <p>Creativity is one thing, but the past decade has also brought Blumenthal a lot of pain. A norovirus outbreak got his signature restaurant The Fat Duck shut down not once but twice, in 2009 and again in 2014. Blumenthal and Zanna, his wife of 28 years, split up in 2011, then divorced six years later. And the tabloids had him in their gossip-spewing sights in the interim. The Daily Mail couldn\u2019t stop <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2025433/Heston-Blumenthal-leaves-wife-Zanna-US-cookbook-goddess-Suzanne-Pirret.html\">quoting</a> his next girlfriend, US food writer Suzanne Pirret, saying food and sex were her favourite two things, \u201cbest one after the other in either order; I\u2019m not picky.\u201d And the secrets that followed \u2013 the affair, the baby and subsequent nuptials with French real estate agent and lover 20 years his junior Stephanie Gouveia \u2013 sent the red tops into a tail spin.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MOmpoGcd00\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1MOmpoGcd00?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to go through those things again. But I wouldn\u2019t want to change them either. I wouldn\u2019t have anything to learn from if it wasn\u2019t for failure.\u201d All those experiences have given him the opportunity, he says, to question a lot about himself. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/23/the-fat-duck-flies-again-heston-blumenthal\">The last time</a> he was interviewed by the Guardian, he was asked if he\u2019d been in therapy. \u201cOf course I have,\u201d he replied. Now, he tells me he\u2019s been thinking a lot about the importance of breathing: \u201cIt\u2019s the most intimate relationship a human being can have, that with themselves and their breath.\u201d</p> <p>Personal and professional trials aren\u2019t the only things that have thrust Blumenthal into the spotlight. Comments he made in an interview last October landed him in hot water with women everywhere, when he brought up evolution, biology and women struggling with \u201cthe physical strain of lifting heavy pots and pans\u201d when asked why there weren\u2019t more female chefs at the top. He was misquoted, he insists, before digging right back into the evolutionary differences between men (they\u2019re physically stronger) and women (they have a more advanced sense of smell, are emotionally more robust). They \u201cshould both be in the picking\u201d was his point, he says.

      "bodyText": "Heston Blumenthal doesn\u2019t stop talking. At speed. His thoughts veer off in a thousand directions, seemingly simultaneously. \u201cQuestion everything\u201d is the motto the chef plumped for on the coat of arms he was granted a few years back, and he does just that: our conversation takes in Newton, Darwin, Homer, Harry Potter, the Bible, the Qu\u2019ran, the invention of the telephone, the invention of social media, breathing, Jaws and saws. The violence of the last two make me blink. Having spoken out in 2015 about TV becoming \u201ctoo formulaic\u201d and subsequently disappearing from our screens, Blumenthal likens the need to take a step back to the scene in Jaws where Roy Scheider is on the beach and hears a scream in the water, as the camera simultaneously zooms out and moves in. He segues swiftly into another metaphor, of a carpenter sawing away with an ever-blunter implement. \u201cHe should stop and have a rest,\u201d he says, \u201cresharpen his saw and start again. But when you\u2019re in the middle of it, you think \u2018I can\u2019t stop, I don\u2019t have time.\u2019\u201d Is this a sign of the culinary wizard coming back an even more intense character? Or perhaps he\u2019s just bringing the drama he\u2019s famous for in the kitchen to our conversation. \u201cI have some funny metaphors I still need to work on,\u201d he concedes. In any case, Blumenthal is very much back. This week, the man famous for serving up giant lit candles, \u2018dismembered corpses\u2019 and edible icebergs as food returns to television as one of the \u201ckitchen gods\u201d on Channel 4\u2019s super-kitsch new cooking show, Crazy Delicious. Styled like a cross between Willy Wonka\u2019s garden and the My Little Pony universe, Crazy Delicious is all puffy clouds and cherry blossom, babbling brooks and blue skies. Crucially, it is TV\u2019s first entirely edible set \u2013 just the thing to bring Blumenthal out of his hiatus. In each episode, three intrepid home cooks are let loose in the fairytale garden to go forth and forage. With their haul, they compete in three tasks, presenting their spectacular, offbeat creations to Blumenthal and his cronies \u2013 American soul-food big-hitter Carla Hall and Michelin-starred Swedish fire-pit master Niklas Ekstedt \u2013 to compete for the golden apple. \u201cIt taps right into my heart, my blood, my culinary DNA,\u201d says Blumenthal. The challenge he has always embraced, he says, is to make things that taste as good as they look, while being at odds with exactly what they look like. Doing it all in chocolate would be too easy. Instead, unleashing wild creativity \u2013 travelling to the outer rim of Bake Off, so to speak \u2013 is what he\u2019s all about. Creativity is one thing, but the past decade has also brought Blumenthal a lot of pain. A norovirus outbreak got his signature restaurant The Fat Duck shut down not once but twice, in 2009 and again in 2014. Blumenthal and Zanna, his wife of 28 years, split up in 2011, then divorced six years later. And the tabloids had him in their gossip-spewing sights in the interim. The Daily Mail couldn\u2019t stop quoting his next girlfriend, US food writer Suzanne Pirret, saying food and sex were her favourite two things, \u201cbest one after the other in either order; I\u2019m not picky.\u201d And the secrets that followed \u2013 the affair, the baby and subsequent nuptials with French real estate agent and lover 20 years his junior Stephanie Gouveia \u2013 sent the red tops into a tail spin. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to go through those things again. But I wouldn\u2019t want to change them either. I wouldn\u2019t have anything to learn from if it wasn\u2019t for failure.\u201d All those experiences have given him the opportunity, he says, to question a lot about himself. The last time he was interviewed by the Guardian, he was asked if he\u2019d been in therapy. \u201cOf course I have,\u201d he replied. Now, he tells me he\u2019s been thinking a lot about the importance of breathing: \u201cIt\u2019s the most intimate relationship a human being can have, that with themselves and their breath.\u201d Personal and professional trials aren\u2019t the only things that have thrust Blumenthal into the spotlight. Comments he made in an interview last October landed him in hot water with women everywhere, when he brought up evolution, biology and women struggling with \u201cthe physical strain of lifting heavy pots and pans\u201d when asked why there weren\u2019t more female chefs at the top. He was misquoted, he insists, before digging right back into the evolutionary differences between men (they\u2019re physically stronger) and women (they have a more advanced sense of smell, are emotionally more robust). They \u201cshould both be in the picking\u201d was his point, he says. Still, this leaves his detractors\u2019 arguments (\u201cThank goodness [women] can find the strength to lift their children, their buggies and all the shopping\u201d tweeted a reader at the time) unanswered. Meanwhile, last week, he\u2019s taken flak for suggesting diners should stop Instagramming their meals and just eat them instead. \u201cOh keep up\u201d has been the general response to that bit of boomerism, which makes the undeniable tongue-in-cheek quality of Crazy Delicious most welcome.

But when you think of the pedestal on which celebrity chefs are placed \u2013 their books as Bibles, their followers as disciples (incidentally, in 2014 Blumenthal invested in a racehorse named Acolyte) \u2013 it is refreshing to see the three of them so game. Was irony part of the appeal? \u201cNo, I was very scared of that,\u201d says Blumenthal. \u201cWhen we first walked up the stairs with our white trousers and shoes on, Niklas and I looked at each other and went, \u2018gods??\u2019\u201d White being the worst colour for food-tasting notwithstanding, they thought to hell with it, and tucked right in.

      "body": "<p>Three weeks after my first book was published, I sat on a ragged couch in a greenroom at a studio in San Francisco, working furiously on two cough drops in my mouth, debating whether to chew them.</p> <p>On a small table in front of me was a paper cup containing tea too hot to drink. My husband, who\u2019d joined me through most of my book tour, didn\u2019t complain about my sweaty hand clutching his. I\u2019d finished my 17th and final event on the road that afternoon and looked forward to having an evening off before flying home the next day, but my publicist had emailed about one last thing: a live interview with Ana Cabrera of CNN.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/27/why-i-came-out-as-being-poor\">Why I came out as being poor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Through a fog of cold medicine, my introverted, weary mind tried to comprehend what that meant. The interview was set for six minutes. I knew I couldn\u2019t keep that cough quiet for that long. When they sat me at a table in a dark room, a green screen behind me, I muttered \u201cJust don\u2019t cough\u201d while someone put an ear piece in my ear, then directed me to look at the red light. \u201cThat\u2019s where the camera is,\u201d he said.</p> <p>I searched for a monitor to see what they were showing onscreen, and there was none. It was me, a curved table, a bright light on my face, and a silent black room.</p> <p>When Ana asked me how I wrote my story, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/23/porn-opiods-cigarettes-what-cleaner-saw-in-america-homes-staphanie-land-maid\">the one about making ends meet in America as a single mom</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/23/porn-opiods-cigarettes-what-cleaner-saw-in-america-homes-staphanie-land-maid\"> cleaning houses</a>, my response was, un-intellectually, \u201cI don\u2019t know, honestly.\u201d But then I looked down (I wasn\u2019t supposed to look down, I was supposed to stare at the red light) and thought about the dozens of messages I had been receiving every day for over a month. I said: \u201cThe more vulnerable you\u2019re willing to be, the more nerves you touch with other people who have been through similar situations but might be too scared to admit it. And, really, that\u2019s how we no longer feel alone.\u201d</p> <p>The messages had started coming in shortly after I began doing interviews about my story. Messages filled every inbox on every social media platform.

      "bodyText": "Three weeks after my first book was published, I sat on a ragged couch in a greenroom at a studio in San Francisco, working furiously on two cough drops in my mouth, debating whether to chew them. On a small table in front of me was a paper cup containing tea too hot to drink. My husband, who\u2019d joined me through most of my book tour, didn\u2019t complain about my sweaty hand clutching his. I\u2019d finished my 17th and final event on the road that afternoon and looked forward to having an evening off before flying home the next day, but my publicist had emailed about one last thing: a live interview with Ana Cabrera of CNN. Through a fog of cold medicine, my introverted, weary mind tried to comprehend what that meant. The interview was set for six minutes. I knew I couldn\u2019t keep that cough quiet for that long. When they sat me at a table in a dark room, a green screen behind me, I muttered \u201cJust don\u2019t cough\u201d while someone put an ear piece in my ear, then directed me to look at the red light. \u201cThat\u2019s where the camera is,\u201d he said. I searched for a monitor to see what they were showing onscreen, and there was none. It was me, a curved table, a bright light on my face, and a silent black room. When Ana asked me how I wrote my story, the one about making ends meet in America as a single mom cleaning houses, my response was, un-intellectually, \u201cI don\u2019t know, honestly.\u201d But then I looked down (I wasn\u2019t supposed to look down, I was supposed to stare at the red light) and thought about the dozens of messages I had been receiving every day for over a month. I said: \u201cThe more vulnerable you\u2019re willing to be, the more nerves you touch with other people who have been through similar situations but might be too scared to admit it. And, really, that\u2019s how we no longer feel alone.\u201d The messages had started coming in shortly after I began doing interviews about my story. Messages filled every inbox on every social media platform. There were hundreds. Surprisingly, only a few were like the ones I\u2019d received in the past \u2013 ones that were full of hate and disgust that I\u2019d dared to have children when I was poor. Many asked me for help in writing their own story, which was impossible for me to give individually. Every other one seemed to be an invitation to speak at a festival, conference, library, or bookstore. And then, lines like these seemed to stand out so much it was like they were in bold: \u201cJust knowing that I am not alone in my experience has been uplifting and powerfully healing today.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. Sometimes, if I did, I\u2019d get several longer messages. People seemed desperate to feel seen, and for that brief moment, I did see them. I carried their stories with me, and still do. \u201cYour story is my story, only my daughter\u2019s name is Molly.\u201d Some of them just stated: \u201cI am Mia,\u201d the name of my daughter. Some wrote about their current struggles, thanking me for giving a voice to the working poor. \u201cI got a job at a daycare making $9 an hour and because of that they cut my food stamps down to $40 a month. $10 a week to feed my daughter and I.\u201d People sent me photos of their kids at college graduations, saying they still cleaned houses and struggled to get by, but their kid would have a better life.

Many of our friends watched two good people get married, start a family, move to three different cities, start and finish school, and so much more. We didn\u2019t tell anyone for almost a year because we were afraid of what people might think. My main focus at the time was not flunking law school or failing the bar exam because of all the emotional stress.

Short-lived relationships can make us more beautiful and long-term relationships can turn us ugly. Neither length should be romanticized. Both should be critically entered.

      "body": "<p>Physical theatre company <a href=\"https://www.thepappyshow.co.uk/\">The PappyShow</a> devises its material through workshops, games and role-playing for its racially diverse ensemble, who have varied backgrounds and training. That approach explains some of the qualities of their 10-man performance <a href=\"https://mimelondon.com/the-pappyshow-boys-2020/\">Boys</a>: part confessional, part standup, part community theatre, it is by turns taut, scrappy, hard-hitting, offhand, deeply felt \u2013 and always personable.</p> <p>The vibe on stage is cheerfully boisterous. Since the piece is about young men and the relations between them, explains one of them, it might as well kick off with a commonplace: a fight. The vibe evaporates. In a viscerally choreographed and sickeningly recognisable scene, one man is singled out from the group, brutally attacked, humiliated and finally killed \u2013 by the hand of one other man, yes, but even more clearly by the dynamics of the group itself. The moment is later revisited in another impressively physical scene that now intimates the pain behind the pathology, with mourner and murderer implicated within the same dance of blind flails and staggers.</p> <p>Other sections are more hit and miss. A competition with categories for \u201cbest Beyonc\u00e9\u201d and \u201cmost shocked face\u201d yields genuine if easy laughs; lineups with the men revealing fragments of personality and personal history are more intermittently engaging. The turns come thick and fast \u2013 haka dance, self-conscious comic, endurance test challenge, a teeter in pink stilettos \u2013 and the general ambience is jokey, blokey, sometimes a bit hokey.</p> <p>Yet there are exceptional moments. One man\u2019s solitary fury, vent upon kicked chairs, transmutes into the heartbreakingly simple song of a boy whose father has left. The closing image of brotherhood, the men forming supportive chains of linked limbs, offers a touching alternative to the opening scene. But the strongest counter to that violent beginning turns out to be of a different order: a kind of love scene. With tenderness, interest and playfulness, two men find ways of being together with each other \u2013 clasps, caresses, balances, flips and feints \u2013 that don\u2019t turn into conflict, display or jokes. At first, you think they must be portraying lovers, but when they return it looks almost as if they are different parts of the same man, learning how to love himself.</p> <p>\u2022 At the <a href=\"https://www.thepappyshow.co.uk/boys\">Purcell Room, London</a>, until 21 January. The <a href=\"https://mimelondon.com/\">London international mime festival</a> continues until 2 February. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Physical theatre company The PappyShow devises its material through workshops, games and role-playing for its racially diverse ensemble, who have varied backgrounds and training. That approach explains some of the qualities of their 10-man performance Boys: part confessional, part standup, part community theatre, it is by turns taut, scrappy, hard-hitting, offhand, deeply felt \u2013 and always personable. The vibe on stage is cheerfully boisterous. Since the piece is about young men and the relations between them, explains one of them, it might as well kick off with a commonplace: a fight. The vibe evaporates. In a viscerally choreographed and sickeningly recognisable scene, one man is singled out from the group, brutally attacked, humiliated and finally killed \u2013 by the hand of one other man, yes, but even more clearly by the dynamics of the group itself. The moment is later revisited in another impressively physical scene that now intimates the pain behind the pathology, with mourner and murderer implicated within the same dance of blind flails and staggers. Other sections are more hit and miss. A competition with categories for \u201cbest Beyonc\u00e9\u201d and \u201cmost shocked face\u201d yields genuine if easy laughs; lineups with the men revealing fragments of personality and personal history are more intermittently engaging. The turns come thick and fast \u2013 haka dance, self-conscious comic, endurance test challenge, a teeter in pink stilettos \u2013 and the general ambience is jokey, blokey, sometimes a bit hokey. Yet there are exceptional moments. One man\u2019s solitary fury, vent upon kicked chairs, transmutes into the heartbreakingly simple song of a boy whose father has left. The closing image of brotherhood, the men forming supportive chains of linked limbs, offers a touching alternative to the opening scene. But the strongest counter to that violent beginning turns out to be of a different order: a kind of love scene. With tenderness, interest and playfulness, two men find ways of being together with each other \u2013 clasps, caresses, balances, flips and feints \u2013 that don\u2019t turn into conflict, display or jokes. At first, you think they must be portraying lovers, but when they return it looks almost as if they are different parts of the same man, learning how to love himself. \u2022 At the Purcell Room, London, until 21 January. The London international mime festival continues until 2 February.",

If approved by MPs and peers, the new powers will come into force on 1 April and apply to relevant sentences imposed on or after that date. \u201cTime and again victims tell me they feel let down by a system that can see violent and sexual offenders back on the streets after serving just half their sentence,\u201d the justice secretary and Lord Chancellor, Robert Buckland QC, said. \u201cSo we will end the automatic halfway release for these offenders \u2013 ensuring punishment truly fits the crime and restore the public\u2019s faith in the justice system.\u201d Since 2005, the majority of offenders serving standard determinate sentences have been released automatically at the halfway point. They tend to serve the rest of the sentence in the community. Judges do already have powers to delay the automatic release of prisoners. In 2018, more than 4,000 standard determinate sentences were imposed for sexual or violent offences which carry a maximum penalty of life. On Tuesday, Buckland claimed the government was not politicising the deaths of Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones at the hands of Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist who had been released halfway through his jail sentence. The justice secretary denied he was \u201crushing\u201d new anti-terror laws and said ministers had to act, otherwise the public would think they were \u201cdragging their feet\u201d on the issue. Changes to be introduced in March include ending automatic early release from prison for terror offenders and a minimum jail term of 14 years for serious criminals. Lie detector tests could also be used to assess someone before their potential release. Merritt\u2019s father had said publicly he did not want his son\u2019s death to be used to roll out more draconian prison sentences, considering the 25-year-old\u2019s work in prisoner rehabilitation. Speaking on Sky News\u2019s Kay Burley show, Buckland said: \u201cCertainly I do not want to politicise any tragedy, which is why although we move at pace with this legislation, it\u2019s not just about the top end of sentencing, important though that is. It\u2019s about resources we put into our prisons because whilst there are some of these people sadly not capable of rehabilitation, there are examples of others who are.\u201d The interview was the first time a government minister had appeared on Burley\u2019s breakfast news show since the general election campaign, when she \u201cempty-chaired\u201d the party chairman, James Cleverly, who she claimed did not arrive for an interview. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live later on Tuesday, Buckland said he did not disregard rehabilitation as a method but in some cases people could not turn their lives around. \u201cI do not disregard the work of people like Jack and everybody else who spend so much of their time to help rehabilitate prisoners. \u201cBut the truth is, the first duty of the government is to protect the public and I have to be frank and acknowledge the fact that whilst there are some of these offenders who are capable of reform, there are others who are not.\u201d",

I wanted to be as helpful as I can to the cause,\u201d Jackson tells the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019m very busy during the season, putting a lot of hours in. So it was the perfect storm with the new year and my season ending.\u201d</p> <p>And he sees parallels between the life of a politician and an athlete. \u201cI want to push for things that help the most people, and that\u2019s a progressive champion like Bernie and progressive policies,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s consistency. Being an athlete, consistent improvement is what I\u2019m always thinking about. For Bernie, it\u2019s consistency in his policies, and really his principles. He\u2019s been fighting for these things, even when they weren\u2019t on the minds of most Americans, when they weren\u2019t polling well. I know when it comes down to it, you\u2019re going to have to fight the Republicans tooth and nail for everything, and Bernie has a movement behind him. He\u2019s going to have to have a movement of people in the streets, putting pressure on Democrats and Republicans \u2013 especially Democrats \u2013 to come around and vote for his platform.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson is hardly the first professional athlete to use social media as a political vehicle, but few have done so as relentlessly as he has in the last few weeks. It\u2019s one thing to fire off a tweet in support of a candidate; it\u2019s another to be a poster<em>.</em> Jackson\u2019s politics are not just a peripheral part of his Twitter persona.<em> </em></p> <p>There\u2019s a generational element to all that, of course \u2013 and not just because Jackson, like so many of his contemporaries, spends plenty of time online. His political awakening came in 2016, when he was in the midst of an illustrious career at Northwestern University. That was the first year Jackson, 23, was eligible to vote in a presidential election; up to that point, he hadn\u2019t given politics much thought. But Jackson was on a politically minded squad. (In 2015, the Northwestern football team tried unsuccessfully to become <a href=\"https://www.si.com/college/2016/02/24/northwestern-union-case-book-indentured\">the first college athletes\u2019 union</a> in the United States.) And as he listened to his teammates discuss the 2016 race, Jackson\u2019s interest was piqued.</p> <p>\u201cWe were having all these conversations in the locker room,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk out of my ass, so I knew I had to get more knowledgeable on these issues.\u201d</p> <p>What ensued was a crash course in progressive media. He began reading The Intercept and The Nation, and tuning in to online programs like The Kyle Kulinski Show and The Rational National. The Young Turks, a left-wing YouTube channel, quickly became one of Jackson\u2019s touchstones.</p> <p>\u201cI was not very politically active before that, which I think really helped me because once I became politically conscious I realized how much people are socialized and herded,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t even think for yourself.\u201d</p> <p>All that makes Jackson illustrative of the type of voter who the Sanders campaign believes it has a unique ability to attract: young, previously disengaged from politics, unwedded to either party.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping in reality it\u2019s even better than the polling because of all the grassroots support he has,\u201d Jackson says of Sanders\u2019 chances. \u201cI\u2019m hoping he has a lot of people who didn\u2019t vote. That\u2019s the biggest voting bloc: the people who didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson was selected by the Chargers in <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-jackson?id=32194a41-4328-3219-d5e0-94e7d9512273\">the seventh round of the 2018 draft</a> after finishing his four-year career at Northwestern as the school\u2019s all-time leading rusher. He said that some current teammates and former NFL players have applauded him for his politically charged tweets, and that no one associated with the Chargers franchise has told him to dial it back. That last part can\u2019t be taken for granted, given the ongoing league-wide freezeout of Colin Kaepernick, the uproar surrounding players kneeling during the national anthem and the oft-invoked admonitions for athletes to \u201cstick to sports.\u201d </p> <p>Jackson, who was still in college when the anthem protests began, said he has even greater appreciation for the likes of Kaepernick since entering the NFL.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a hard profession to stay in,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much focus you have to have on keeping your job, performing year in and year out, that it is a little bit harder to step outside the box. It\u2019s different than the NBA, it\u2019s different than these other leagues, where each player has their own face. It\u2019s a much more collective team game [in the NFL]. It\u2019s just a tough tough arena to be a part of and try to step outside the box, which is why I commend Kaepernick so much. He\u2019s definitely a martyr for the cause.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson says politics aren\u2019t brought up as often in the Chargers locker room as when he was at Northwestern in part because of the structure of an NFL workday, which offers less downtime and fewer opportunities for team-wide discussion. But he said the roster includes both fellow leftists as well as \u201cTrump Republican voters of all races.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it comes down to messaging. A lot of times, you might not want to pay taxes if you don\u2019t think those taxes are going to come back to help you. When you\u2019re not seeing your taxes work for you, of course you don\u2019t want to pay your taxes,\u201d Jackson says, in reference to his Trump-supporting peers. \u201cThat\u2019s where I think a true progressive candidacy and presidency can change a lot. You could see your tax dollars working in a substantial way.\u201d</p> <p>Whether Jackson ends up making that case outside the confines of Twitter remains to be seen. He has already donated to the Sanders\u2019 campaign but, for now, he says he\u2019s more comfortable tweeting than canvassing. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about volunteering, but as far as walking around and talking to people, I\u2019m actually not that great at that.\u201d</p>",

The Young Turks, a left-wing YouTube channel, quickly became one of Jackson\u2019s touchstones. \u201cI was not very politically active before that, which I think really helped me because once I became politically conscious I realized how much people are socialized and herded,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t even think for yourself.\u201d All that makes Jackson illustrative of the type of voter who the Sanders campaign believes it has a unique ability to attract: young, previously disengaged from politics, unwedded to either party. \u201cI\u2019m hoping in reality it\u2019s even better than the polling because of all the grassroots support he has,\u201d Jackson says of Sanders\u2019 chances. \u201cI\u2019m hoping he has a lot of people who didn\u2019t vote. That\u2019s the biggest voting bloc: the people who didn\u2019t.\u201d Jackson was selected by the Chargers in the seventh round of the 2018 draft after finishing his four-year career at Northwestern as the school\u2019s all-time leading rusher. He said that some current teammates and former NFL players have applauded him for his politically charged tweets, and that no one associated with the Chargers franchise has told him to dial it back. That last part can\u2019t be taken for granted, given the ongoing league-wide freezeout of Colin Kaepernick, the uproar surrounding players kneeling during the national anthem and the oft-invoked admonitions for athletes to \u201cstick to sports.\u201d Jackson, who was still in college when the anthem protests began, said he has even greater appreciation for the likes of Kaepernick since entering the NFL. \u201cIt\u2019s such a hard profession to stay in,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much focus you have to have on keeping your job, performing year in and year out, that it is a little bit harder to step outside the box. It\u2019s different than the NBA, it\u2019s different than these other leagues, where each player has their own face. It\u2019s a much more collective team game [in the NFL]. It\u2019s just a tough tough arena to be a part of and try to step outside the box, which is why I commend Kaepernick so much. He\u2019s definitely a martyr for the cause.\u201d Jackson says politics aren\u2019t brought up as often in the Chargers locker room as when he was at Northwestern in part because of the structure of an NFL workday, which offers less downtime and fewer opportunities for team-wide discussion. But he said the roster includes both fellow leftists as well as \u201cTrump Republican voters of all races.\u201d \u201cI think it comes down to messaging. A lot of times, you might not want to pay taxes if you don\u2019t think those taxes are going to come back to help you. When you\u2019re not seeing your taxes work for you, of course you don\u2019t want to pay your taxes,\u201d Jackson says, in reference to his Trump-supporting peers. \u201cThat\u2019s where I think a true progressive candidacy and presidency can change a lot. You could see your tax dollars working in a substantial way.\u201d Whether Jackson ends up making that case outside the confines of Twitter remains to be seen. He has already donated to the Sanders\u2019 campaign but, for now, he says he\u2019s more comfortable tweeting than canvassing. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about volunteering, but as far as walking around and talking to people, I\u2019m actually not that great at that.\u201d",

In the past 20 years, manicures have gone from being an extravagant luxury mostly enjoyed by a moneyed elite to an affordable treat, easily accessible to everyone. But the public awareness of what the low costs may mean for those who work there remains hazy. It is easier to associate cannabis farms and brothels with exploitation.

I\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Anti-trafficking experts believe that they were brought in to the country to work in nail bars, restaurants and cannabis farms. Southwark council has been working with the Metropolitan police on inspecting nail bars since last summer, and the operations have been stepped up in the wake of the Essex tragedy. Yet even news of these deaths has done little to dampen customers\u2019 enthusiasm for \u00a310 manicures.</p> <p>The venue in Peckham is one of five in Southwark being raided simultaneously by 100 police officers. The shop\u2019s thin veneer of frivolity is rapidly stripped away. Inside, there is confusion as eight of the 20 officers crowd inside the narrow space between a row of battered, mismatched treatment chairs, where two startled customers are having their nails painted, and a wall lined with rainbow-coloured pots of varnish. \u201cThis is a search warrant giving police the authority to search these premises for evidence of human trafficking,\u201d one of the officers announces.

And in this operation it is hampered by a decision to allocate just one interpreter to the 25-strong team of police, social workers, immigration officers and council staff squeezed inside the shop and gathering on the pavement outside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c3314c9375798aabae20fb7cd15167fca5d55772\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3314c9375798aabae20fb7cd15167fca5d55772/0_0_5519_3757/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nail bar sign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The nail-bar workers, who are told by the translator they face questioning, look alarmed, but say nothing. By the window, a boy in a grey top, clearly a teenager, sits on a swivel chair, his hands pressed anxiously between his legs, his feet not quite touching the floor. With the translator elsewhere, two social workers try without success to speak to him.</p> <p>\u201cHow old are you? How old are you? You don\u2019t know how old you are? Your age?\u201d one asks, using the time-honoured British technique of communicating with a non-English speaker, of slowly repeating the same question, louder and louder. He replies quietly in Vietnamese, looking unhappy. \u201cHow old are you? Do you speak English? I can\u2019t get anything out of him,\u201d she says, with unreasonable irritation.</p> <p>A teenage girl, who, like all the staff, is wearing a grey top, tells officers through the interpreter that she is 17, but says she isn\u2019t actually working in the shop, and has just stopped by to say hello to a friend as she was in the neighbourhood. \u201cAre your parents here? You mum or dad?\u201d a police officer asks. She shakes her head.</p> <p>The only adult man among the staff is very agitated, and repeatedly requests to be allowed to go to the toilet. Police refuse, concerned that he wants to get rid of something incriminating. Instead, he sits gloomily, snipping his nails, dropping the clippings on the floor. An older woman says she is worried about her baby at home, and asks to leave, but she is told that no one can go until checks have been made on everyone\u2019s immigration status; she is later arrested. One of the younger women says all the takings (the nail bar accepts only cash) are put in a drawer until the end of the day; no one will give a clear answer about how, or how much, they are paid.</p> <p>Figures released last month suggest that the government\u2019s determination to crack down on modern slavery is failing, with only 42 convictions on slavery and human trafficking in 2018, down from 59 in 2017 and 69 in 2016 \u2013 despite the fact that 6,993 potential victims were identified in 2018, a 36% rise on 2017. Theresa May introduced legislation to combat modern slavery in 2015, describing it as one of the \u201cgreat human rights issues of our time\u201d. There was scepticism from some about whether this concern about human trafficking was just the acceptable face of the government\u2019s preoccupation with cutting net migration numbers, and creating a hostile environment for illegal immigration, but most charities welcomed the initiative. However, since then there <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/dec/19/theresa-may-under-fire-anti-slavery-scheme-failure\" title=\"\">has been disappointment</a> about the lack of funding for implementing its measures. There have been very few successful prosecutions of nail-bar owners. In the only high-profile case, two years ago, four teenage girls were found to have been trafficked from Vietnam, forced to work without pay and made to sleep in a loft above Nail Deluxe in central Bath. Police frequently state that victims are too frightened to give evidence against traffickers, but on the evidence of the Southwark operation, their reticence may sometimes simply be down to insufficient interpreters.</p> <p>Outside the shop, more police officers are questioning a tired-looking Vietnamese man who has been peering through the back of the building, then watching proceedings from the other side of the high street and making calls. They ask him to hand over and unlock his phone.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my phone,\u201d he tells them, speaking Vietnamese to the translator. \u201cSome lady just gave it to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you just tell him I\u2019ve never heard such rubbish in my life,\u201d the police officer says, holding the phone in front of the man\u2019s face to see if it would unlock with facial recognition.</p> <p>\u201cTell him we are going to arrest him on suspicion of theft of a mobile phone.\u201d The man unlocks his phone and officers look through the 20 calls he has made and received during the 45 minutes since the raid began, establishes that a number of calls have been made to staff inside the shop and decide to arrest him on suspicion of involvement in modern slavery and people trafficking.</p> <p>Shortly, another man comes to the shop, pushing a small baby in a pram, and looks through the windows at the staff inside. \u201cIs this your shop?\u201d police ask him. He shakes his head, but when asked to show ID, police recognise him as the man named as the shop\u2019s manager on a notice inside. Another officer takes the pram, handcuffs him and tells him: \u201cYou are under arrest for arranging and facilitating modern slavery. We\u2019ll look after the baby, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p> <p>The mother of the baby has already been taken from the shop to a waiting police car. \u201cHe\u2019s been nicked; she\u2019s been nicked. Do we bring the baby to the police station?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want that. We\u2019ll have to take her into care.\u201d</p> <p>Beneath the pram\u2019s plastic rain cover, the baby peeps out, waving its arms around peacefully.</p> <p>\u201cIs there anyone else who can look after the baby?\u201d a police officer asks the translator to ask the man, adding in an aside: \u201cWe\u2019re getting our money\u2019s worth out of you \u2026 Ask him: Is there another family member? When does the baby need food and drink?\u201d</p> <p>A lorry driver waiting at the traffic lights by the shop in a truck piled high with scaffolding, shouts: \u201cLet him off!\u201d before driving away, laughing.</p> <p>In total, 13 people working in the five shops are arrested on suspicion of modern slavery and human trafficking offences, and another seven are arrested on suspicion of immigration offences and possessing counterfeit goods, mostly counterfeit cigarettes. Five children and nine adults are deemed to be vulnerable and taken to a temporary reception centre. The council says later that no one was taken into care, because \u201cpolice weren\u2019t able to establish that any of the young people were children\u201d, although 10 children were found working in Southwark\u2019s nail bars earlier in the year and placed with foster carers. It is unclear what happened to the baby.</p> <p>Mark Rogers, the detective chief inspector leading the operation for the Metropolitan police\u2019s central specialist crime unit, says he is happy with how things have gone. \u201cHuman trafficking, modern slavery and sexual exploitation often occur in plain sight, and it is often the case those carrying out these offences exploit those from less fortunate backgrounds who have travelled to our country for a better life, in the knowledge these individuals will carry out hard, labour-intensive work to provide for themselves.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The industry is very underregulated. Bad products are used, people get fungi, skin problems and there are slaves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So, how can customers tell if a nail bar is not all it seems? Kevin Hyland recommends looking out for anything that doesn\u2019t look right. \u201cThe price is sometimes an indicator but there are other signs.\u201d Are the instructions given through a third party? Are you told: sit here, and that person will do your nails? There should be some ability to interact with the staff; does the worker carry on in silence, never removing the protective face mask? Is there a man sitting at the door, behaving in a dominant way?</p> <p>Yet, ultimately, it shouldn\u2019t be up to the customer to navigate this uncertainty, he argues, and councils should be doing more to inspect and shut down dubious salons. Southwark council has been more proactive than most, but points out that with a 50% cut in government funding over the past decade, protecting the work of trading standards teams is challenging.</p> <p>Samantha Sweet, who runs Creative Nail Design, says it is impossible to tell which discount salons are likely to be exploitative. \u201cIf we knew more about the discount places I think we would choose different places. Some of them are absolutely fine and employ people legally. But I don\u2019t think the general public think about it; they think \u2013 well it\u2019s dead cheap and dead quick.\u201d As a benchmark she said the average gel polish treatment should cost at least \u00a325. But, she says \u201cpart of the problem is that in the cheaper salons, people don\u2019t talk anyway \u2013 they hold out one hand and they\u2019re on their mobile on the other, and then they swap hands.\u201d</p> <p>Millie Kendall, CEO of the British Beauty Council, says two decades ago she only knew of two nail salons in London, but new products, (extensions, fillers, shellac) and the rise of instagram sharing of nail art has made this a rapidly accelerating industry with multiple shops on most high streets. \u201cThe business has changed beyond recognition. Nail art has changed the game and made it a more creative industry. The flip side is that we are very under regulated and that\u2019s a real problem for us. Bad products are being used, people get funguses, skin problems and there are slaves.\u201d She hopes the government will move to license the industry.</p> <p>Mark Rogers says he hopes media coverage of the arrests will \u201ccontinue to raise the public\u2019s awareness of these shocking crimes.\u201d But even when people learn about the issue they tend not to believe it could affect the salon they use; it is hard to understand that you could be in such close proximity to someone who has been trafficked, holding your hand, and silently painting bright varnish on your nails.</p> <p>Despite Southwark\u2019s high-profile campaigns, online reviews of other nail bars in the borough continue to reveal how clients\u2019 irritation with the language barrier is carefully weighed up against the joy of a cheap pedicure. Despite the intimacy involved in the treatment, hands and feet being washed and tended to by strangers, many seem remarkably uncurious about the workers, and concern for their welfare seems negligible. One customer writes: \u201cThe staff were rude both in person and on the phone, some barely spoke any English, you could clearly see they didn\u2019t want to be doing the job. Got a manicure and pedicure \u2013 the job was just about mediocre.\u201d</p>",

There was scepticism from some about whether this concern about human trafficking was just the acceptable face of the government\u2019s preoccupation with cutting net migration numbers, and creating a hostile environment for illegal immigration, but most charities welcomed the initiative. However, since then there has been disappointment about the lack of funding for implementing its measures. There have been very few successful prosecutions of nail-bar owners. In the only high-profile case, two years ago, four teenage girls were found to have been trafficked from Vietnam, forced to work without pay and made to sleep in a loft above Nail Deluxe in central Bath. Police frequently state that victims are too frightened to give evidence against traffickers, but on the evidence of the Southwark operation, their reticence may sometimes simply be down to insufficient interpreters. Outside the shop, more police officers are questioning a tired-looking Vietnamese man who has been peering through the back of the building, then watching proceedings from the other side of the high street and making calls. They ask him to hand over and unlock his phone. \u201cIt\u2019s not my phone,\u201d he tells them, speaking Vietnamese to the translator. \u201cSome lady just gave it to me.\u201d \u201cCan you just tell him I\u2019ve never heard such rubbish in my life,\u201d the police officer says, holding the phone in front of the man\u2019s face to see if it would unlock with facial recognition. \u201cTell him we are going to arrest him on suspicion of theft of a mobile phone.\u201d The man unlocks his phone and officers look through the 20 calls he has made and received during the 45 minutes since the raid began, establishes that a number of calls have been made to staff inside the shop and decide to arrest him on suspicion of involvement in modern slavery and people trafficking. Shortly, another man comes to the shop, pushing a small baby in a pram, and looks through the windows at the staff inside. \u201cIs this your shop?\u201d police ask him. He shakes his head, but when asked to show ID, police recognise him as the man named as the shop\u2019s manager on a notice inside. Another officer takes the pram, handcuffs him and tells him: \u201cYou are under arrest for arranging and facilitating modern slavery. We\u2019ll look after the baby, don\u2019t worry.\u201d The mother of the baby has already been taken from the shop to a waiting police car. \u201cHe\u2019s been nicked; she\u2019s been nicked. Do we bring the baby to the police station?\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want that. We\u2019ll have to take her into care.\u201d Beneath the pram\u2019s plastic rain cover, the baby peeps out, waving its arms around peacefully. \u201cIs there anyone else who can look after the baby?\u201d a police officer asks the translator to ask the man, adding in an aside: \u201cWe\u2019re getting our money\u2019s worth out of you \u2026 Ask him: Is there another family member? When does the baby need food and drink?\u201d A lorry driver waiting at the traffic lights by the shop in a truck piled high with scaffolding, shouts: \u201cLet him off!\u201d before driving away, laughing. In total, 13 people working in the five shops are arrested on suspicion of modern slavery and human trafficking offences, and another seven are arrested on suspicion of immigration offences and possessing counterfeit goods, mostly counterfeit cigarettes. Five children and nine adults are deemed to be vulnerable and taken to a temporary reception centre. The council says later that no one was taken into care, because \u201cpolice weren\u2019t able to establish that any of the young people were children\u201d, although 10 children were found working in Southwark\u2019s nail bars earlier in the year and placed with foster carers. It is unclear what happened to the baby. Mark Rogers, the detective chief inspector leading the operation for the Metropolitan police\u2019s central specialist crime unit, says he is happy with how things have gone. \u201cHuman trafficking, modern slavery and sexual exploitation often occur in plain sight, and it is often the case those carrying out these offences exploit those from less fortunate backgrounds who have travelled to our country for a better life, in the knowledge these individuals will carry out hard, labour-intensive work to provide for themselves.\u201d So, how can customers tell if a nail bar is not all it seems? Kevin Hyland recommends looking out for anything that doesn\u2019t look right. \u201cThe price is sometimes an indicator but there are other signs.\u201d Are the instructions given through a third party? Are you told: sit here, and that person will do your nails? There should be some ability to interact with the staff; does the worker carry on in silence, never removing the protective face mask? Is there a man sitting at the door, behaving in a dominant way? Yet, ultimately, it shouldn\u2019t be up to the customer to navigate this uncertainty, he argues, and councils should be doing more to inspect and shut down dubious salons. Southwark council has been more proactive than most, but points out that with a 50% cut in government funding over the past decade, protecting the work of trading standards teams is challenging. Samantha Sweet, who runs Creative Nail Design, says it is impossible to tell which discount salons are likely to be exploitative. \u201cIf we knew more about the discount places I think we would choose different places. Some of them are absolutely fine and employ people legally. But I don\u2019t think the general public think about it; they think \u2013 well it\u2019s dead cheap and dead quick.\u201d As a benchmark she said the average gel polish treatment should cost at least \u00a325. But, she says \u201cpart of the problem is that in the cheaper salons, people don\u2019t talk anyway \u2013 they hold out one hand and they\u2019re on their mobile on the other, and then they swap hands.\u201d Millie Kendall, CEO of the British Beauty Council, says two decades ago she only knew of two nail salons in London, but new products, (extensions, fillers, shellac) and the rise of instagram sharing of nail art has made this a rapidly accelerating industry with multiple shops on most high streets. \u201cThe business has changed beyond recognition. Nail art has changed the game and made it a more creative industry. The flip side is that we are very under regulated and that\u2019s a real problem for us. Bad products are being used, people get funguses, skin problems and there are slaves.\u201d She hopes the government will move to license the industry. Mark Rogers says he hopes media coverage of the arrests will \u201ccontinue to raise the public\u2019s awareness of these shocking crimes.\u201d But even when people learn about the issue they tend not to believe it could affect the salon they use; it is hard to understand that you could be in such close proximity to someone who has been trafficked, holding your hand, and silently painting bright varnish on your nails. Despite Southwark\u2019s high-profile campaigns, online reviews of other nail bars in the borough continue to reveal how clients\u2019 irritation with the language barrier is carefully weighed up against the joy of a cheap pedicure. Despite the intimacy involved in the treatment, hands and feet being washed and tended to by strangers, many seem remarkably uncurious about the workers, and concern for their welfare seems negligible. One customer writes: \u201cThe staff were rude both in person and on the phone, some barely spoke any English, you could clearly see they didn\u2019t want to be doing the job. Got a manicure and pedicure \u2013 the job was just about mediocre.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Social mobility is in decline in Britain, with more than half of people saying the government is failing to do enough to help the least well off, according to a survey by ministers\u2019 advisory body on life chances. The poll, by the Social Mobility Commission, found stark regional differences in people\u2019s perceptions of their life prospects, with people in the north-east and north-west of England significantly less optimistic than their southern counterparts Just under a third of people in the north-east said they felt they had a good chance to get on in life in their own region, compared with 74% of those in the south-east and 78% of Londoners. The commission said the survey, carried out for its annual social mobility barometer, revealed deep unease in many regions about whether people had the same access to good education, jobs and housing as those living in the more prosperous south. Dame Martina Milburn, the chair of the commission, said the survey was a call to action for politicians, who should start to reverse \u201cthe inequalities of generations\u201d and give people an equal chance in life. \u201cRegions which have been marginalised for decades should get the investment they need to provide opportunities for young people, so they don\u2019t have to move out to move up,\u201d she said. Although 63% of people felt they had received a better school education compared with their parents, nearly half said they had a worse standard of living than the previous generation, and only 29% felt they had better job security. Despite feeling they had good opportunities to progress, Londoners were more likely to say they were worse off than their parents when it came to housing, job security, overall living standards and personal finances. Young people have a particularly pessimistic outlook, the poll suggests. Only a third of 18- to 24-year-olds said they thought everyone in Britain today had a fair chance to progress, compared with almost half of those aged 65 and over. Most people of all ages agreed there were fewer opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds to go to a top university or to own their own home compared with their better-off peers. Other findings include: Of those surveyed, 44% agreed that where a person ends up in society was largely determined by their background. Only 35% felt that everyone had a fair chance to get on. The majority of people (77%) felt there was a large gap between the social classes in Britain, a finding that has not changed from previous years, suggesting it is a deeply entrenched view. Twice as many middle-class people (50%) felt their background gave them an advantage in their education (50%), career choice and career progression, than working-class people (22%). The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said the findings were unsurprising. \u201cFor the last nine years, Tory-led austerity has had a devastating impact throughout the country,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need real change and meaningful policies. Ministers must focus on securing social justice for all, rather than a leg-up for a few.\u201d The Social Mobility Barometer was based on a poll just under 5,000 people carried out online by YouGov in March 2019.",

      "body": "<p>Mikel Arteta isn\u2019t anticipating major transfer activity involving Arsenal this month, but <strong>Barcelona</strong> have other ideas. The Spanish champions are keen to kickstart the Quique Seti\u00e9n era with a headline signing up front and <strong>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</strong> could be just the man. With the injured Luis Su\u00e1rez possibly on the move in the summer, the Express reckons Aubameyang\u2019s desire for Champions League football might be decisive in prising him to the Camp Nou from the Europa League perennials.</p> <p>Currently frustrated in their attempts to get a deal for the Sporting midfielder Bruno Fernandes over the line, <strong>Manchester United</strong> have scanned the rumourmongers and gossip rags for another oft-mentioned name and decided Lyon\u2019s <strong>Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9</strong> could be the man to provide much-needed firepower up top. FootMercato suggests United are lining up a \u00a343m bid for the former Celtic forward in an attempt to silence Gary Neville\u2019s carping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/20/gary-neville-rails-at-ed-woodward-over-manchester-united-mess\">about the state of their squad-building</a>. They also have a plan B lined up for a midfielder as hopes fade of securing Fernandes, in the form of <strong>Internazionale\u2019s Matias Vecino</strong>. The 28-year-old Uruguay international has played 17 times for Inter this season but is not considered a first-choice by Antonio Conte, and could be ripe for plucking by Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, reports the Mirror, though much may depend on Inter getting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/20/inter-milan-christian-eriksen-tottenham-transfer-news-premier-league\">that pesky Christian Eriksen deal done</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/dec/30/football-january-transfer-window-latest-deals-premier-league-europe\">Transfer window January 2020 \u2013\u00a0every deal from Europe's top five leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Away from the Eriksen saga, <strong>Tottenham</strong> like the look of Sheffield United\u2019s <strong>Jack O\u2019Connell</strong>. The 25-year-old has impressed in Chris Wilder\u2019s funky defensive formation this season, having moved through the divisions with the Blades, but he is out of contract in the summer and Spurs think he could be the man to replace Jan Vertonghen in the heart of their defence, according to the Daily Star. United may also have to fend off interest from Arsenal in their midfielders <strong>John Fleck</strong> and <strong>George Baldock</strong> come the summer.</p> <p><strong>Wolves</strong> have been quiet during this window but you can\u2019t keep a good agent down and Jorge Mendes has been told by Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo to get busy with trying to bring in Olympiakos\u2019s Portuguese forward <strong>Daniel Podence</strong> to the Black Country. Podence scored for the Greek side in their Champions League draw with Spurs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/18/olympiakos-tottenham-hotspur-champions-league-match-report\">earlier in the season</a> and Wolves are reportedly closing on a \u00a320m deal.

      "bodyText": "Mikel Arteta isn\u2019t anticipating major transfer activity involving Arsenal this month, but Barcelona have other ideas. The Spanish champions are keen to kickstart the Quique Seti\u00e9n era with a headline signing up front and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang could be just the man. With the injured Luis Su\u00e1rez possibly on the move in the summer, the Express reckons Aubameyang\u2019s desire for Champions League football might be decisive in prising him to the Camp Nou from the Europa League perennials. Currently frustrated in their attempts to get a deal for the Sporting midfielder Bruno Fernandes over the line, Manchester United have scanned the rumourmongers and gossip rags for another oft-mentioned name and decided Lyon\u2019s Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 could be the man to provide much-needed firepower up top. FootMercato suggests United are lining up a \u00a343m bid for the former Celtic forward in an attempt to silence Gary Neville\u2019s carping about the state of their squad-building. They also have a plan B lined up for a midfielder as hopes fade of securing Fernandes, in the form of Internazionale\u2019s Matias Vecino. The 28-year-old Uruguay international has played 17 times for Inter this season but is not considered a first-choice by Antonio Conte, and could be ripe for plucking by Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, reports the Mirror, though much may depend on Inter getting that pesky Christian Eriksen deal done. Away from the Eriksen saga, Tottenham like the look of Sheffield United\u2019s Jack O\u2019Connell. The 25-year-old has impressed in Chris Wilder\u2019s funky defensive formation this season, having moved through the divisions with the Blades, but he is out of contract in the summer and Spurs think he could be the man to replace Jan Vertonghen in the heart of their defence, according to the Daily Star. United may also have to fend off interest from Arsenal in their midfielders John Fleck and George Baldock come the summer. Wolves have been quiet during this window but you can\u2019t keep a good agent down and Jorge Mendes has been told by Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo to get busy with trying to bring in Olympiakos\u2019s Portuguese forward Daniel Podence to the Black Country. Podence scored for the Greek side in their Champions League draw with Spurs earlier in the season and Wolves are reportedly closing on a \u00a320m deal. Wolves have also been linked with another Greece-based forward, the AEK Athens striker Nelson Oliveira, as they look to reinforce their squad during their 1,000-game season. At the foot of the Premier League Bournemouth need something, anything, to arrest their slump and, though Eddie Howe is downplaying reports of major January transfer activity, the local Daily Echo believes the Cherries are interested in a securing the Borussia Dortmund winger Jacob Bruun Larsen on a loan deal. And you just can\u2019t keep Inter out of this column, with the latest reported item on the merry-go-round being their winger Valentino Lazaro, 23, in whom Newcastle are reportedly interested. Lazaro\u2019s agent was on Tyneside at the weekend and the Newcastle Chronicle suggests a deal could be done in the next 24-48 hours.

      "body": "<p>The last time we saw Jean-Luc Picard, Patrick Stewart\u2019s venerable Starfleet captain, he was aboard a box-fresh Enterprise at the end of 2002\u2019s Star Trek: Nemesis, ready to continue boldly going where no man has gone before. Goody-two-shoes android Data was dead. William Riker, Picard\u2019s ever-reliable No 1, had flown the roost to command a ship of his own. It was a bittersweet send-off for Picard: never mind that Nemesis wasn\u2019t a great film, really only notable for a young Tom Hardy\u2019s up-to-11 mugging as an evil Picard clone, its denouement succeeded in tying a graceful bow around the arc of Stewart\u2019s character. In the imaginations of fans he lived out his days in happiness, whizzing amiably around the galaxy, or pottering about his vineyard getting gently sozzled. Fifteen years after it arrived on TV, Star Trek\u2019s Next Generation had reached a satisfying end.</p> <p>Or not, as it turns out. Picard is back in a new big-budget Trek series called, well, Picard, and it transpires Jean-Luc\u2019s dotage wasn\u2019t quite as relaxing as we hoped. \u201cI was haunted by my past,\u201d Stewart intones solemnly in a trailer, \u201cbut now I have a mission.\u201d The Federation of Planets, whose values of honour and equality Picard has spent a lifetime upholding, has apparently taken an alarming turn for the Brexit, and our erstwhile captain is wrenched from well-earned retirement into a gritty, sweary, violent new Trek universe. It all looks to be a rather serious affair. And while it\u2019s goose-pimplingly lovely seeing Sir Pat back in the Starfleet-issue spandex that made him Forbidden Planet royalty, it\u2019s a joy tempered with betrayal, because it means Nemesis\u2019s ending \u2013 the one the character and audience both deserved \u2013 has been effectively nullified. There are no conclusive happily-ever-afters for our beloved heroes of sci-fi and fantasy. Welcome to the era of the \u201cbleakquel\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"973dcfa8ef44f78d8a4e7e96f69bc7acfc26ee3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/973dcfa8ef44f78d8a4e7e96f69bc7acfc26ee3e/129_262_2228_2652/840.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Luc who it is...

Before, any fan with R2-D2 on their jim-jams could envisage the three of them growing old together, with a grey-muzzled Chewbacca snoozing contentedly by a crackling hearth. The new films suddenly forced them to confront a new reality in which Han and Leia are estranged because their son became a mass-murderer, and a PTSD-ravaged Luke lives a life of solitude on a remote skerry somewhere uncannily reminiscent of Ireland. And what happens next? Oh, they all die. Miserably. Great. Thanks.</p> <p>It\u2019s an amazingly bleak way of elongating a franchise, and it\u2019s happening everywhere. Spoilers follow, so beware. Terminator: Dark Fate killed off a young John Connor in its opening minutes, condemning John\u2019s bereaved mother Sarah to a lifetime of guilt and revenge. Independence Day: Resurgence nobbled the original\u2019s hero, Will Smith\u2019s Steven Hiller, leaving behind a grieving son who then had to watch Roland Emmerich drop a million tonnes of masonry on his mum. The resuscitated X-Files in 2016 caught up with a Mulder and Scully at low ebbs. Serenity offered fans of the prematurely cancelled Joss Whedon series Firefly closure, but did so by murdering \u2013 yes, murdering \u2013 two of its most popular characters.

      "bodyText": "The last time we saw Jean-Luc Picard, Patrick Stewart\u2019s venerable Starfleet captain, he was aboard a box-fresh Enterprise at the end of 2002\u2019s Star Trek: Nemesis, ready to continue boldly going where no man has gone before. Goody-two-shoes android Data was dead. William Riker, Picard\u2019s ever-reliable No 1, had flown the roost to command a ship of his own. It was a bittersweet send-off for Picard: never mind that Nemesis wasn\u2019t a great film, really only notable for a young Tom Hardy\u2019s up-to-11 mugging as an evil Picard clone, its denouement succeeded in tying a graceful bow around the arc of Stewart\u2019s character. In the imaginations of fans he lived out his days in happiness, whizzing amiably around the galaxy, or pottering about his vineyard getting gently sozzled. Fifteen years after it arrived on TV, Star Trek\u2019s Next Generation had reached a satisfying end. Or not, as it turns out. Picard is back in a new big-budget Trek series called, well, Picard, and it transpires Jean-Luc\u2019s dotage wasn\u2019t quite as relaxing as we hoped. \u201cI was haunted by my past,\u201d Stewart intones solemnly in a trailer, \u201cbut now I have a mission.\u201d The Federation of Planets, whose values of honour and equality Picard has spent a lifetime upholding, has apparently taken an alarming turn for the Brexit, and our erstwhile captain is wrenched from well-earned retirement into a gritty, sweary, violent new Trek universe. It all looks to be a rather serious affair. And while it\u2019s goose-pimplingly lovely seeing Sir Pat back in the Starfleet-issue spandex that made him Forbidden Planet royalty, it\u2019s a joy tempered with betrayal, because it means Nemesis\u2019s ending \u2013 the one the character and audience both deserved \u2013 has been effectively nullified. There are no conclusive happily-ever-afters for our beloved heroes of sci-fi and fantasy. Welcome to the era of the \u201cbleakquel\u201d. Take the recent Star Wars trilogy, whose entire existence is predicated on the revelation that Han, Leia and Luke all had a miserable old time of it after the events of Return of the Jedi. Before, any fan with R2-D2 on their jim-jams could envisage the three of them growing old together, with a grey-muzzled Chewbacca snoozing contentedly by a crackling hearth. The new films suddenly forced them to confront a new reality in which Han and Leia are estranged because their son became a mass-murderer, and a PTSD-ravaged Luke lives a life of solitude on a remote skerry somewhere uncannily reminiscent of Ireland. And what happens next? Oh, they all die. Miserably. Great. Thanks. It\u2019s an amazingly bleak way of elongating a franchise, and it\u2019s happening everywhere. Spoilers follow, so beware. Terminator: Dark Fate killed off a young John Connor in its opening minutes, condemning John\u2019s bereaved mother Sarah to a lifetime of guilt and revenge. Independence Day: Resurgence nobbled the original\u2019s hero, Will Smith\u2019s Steven Hiller, leaving behind a grieving son who then had to watch Roland Emmerich drop a million tonnes of masonry on his mum. The resuscitated X-Files in 2016 caught up with a Mulder and Scully at low ebbs. Serenity offered fans of the prematurely cancelled Joss Whedon series Firefly closure, but did so by murdering \u2013 yes, murdering \u2013 two of its most popular characters. Even the outstanding Logan, the final piece in the original X-Men saga, had to put a knackered Wolverine and Professor X through a gruelling wringer, culminating in them both being morally redeemed, yet no less dead for their efforts. For all its missteps, 2008\u2019s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull at least gifted archaeology\u2019s sexiest whip enthusiast a serviceable farewell: Jones was content, married, and father to Shia LaBeouf\u2019s Mutt. When we left him he was as close to happiness as it\u2019s possible to be. Next year, another Jones film is due.

With the economic damage done by the devastating 2003 Sars virus still fresh in the mind of many traders, stocks were sold heavily on Tuesday and expectations grew that the markets were in for more falls in the days ahead. The fears across the region were particularly acute given the threat of contagion as hundreds of millions travel for the forthcoming lunar new year holidays when up to 400 million are expected to be on the move across China.

The Sars outbreak claimed the lives of at least 650 people in China and Hong ong in 2002-03 and caused lasting economic damage and disruption. The impact on the Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index was not helped on Tuesday after Moody\u2019s said it had lowered its rating in a fresh blow to the financial hub, which is expected to have fallen into recession last year owing to the unrest as well as the China-US trade war. Investors had already been guarded after the International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts, mostly due to a surprisingly sharp slowdown in India and other emerging markets. There had been some relief as Donald Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron seemed to have struck a truce over a proposed digital tax. The two agreed to hold off on a potential tariffs war until the end of the year, a French diplomatic source said. Trump is due to deliver a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos later on Tuesday, and trade and tariffs could be on the agenda.

      "bodyText": "A former Catalan police chief has denied being close to the deposed regional president who led the failed bid for independence from Spain two years ago, as he appeared in court accused of rebellion over his alleged role in the push for secession. Josep Llu\u00eds Trapero, who served as the chief of the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra until he was sacked by the central government in October 2017, faces up to 11 years in prison if convicted of colluding with the regional government of Carles Puigdemont. Trapero is one of four senior Catalan officials whose trial began on Monday at Spain\u2019s highest criminal court, the Audiencia Nacional. Pere Soler, a former regional police director, and C\u00e9sar Puig, a former Catalan interior ministry official, are accused of rebellion, while Teresa Laplana a senior Mossos officer, is charged with sedition. The proceedings, which are expected to last until mid-March, come three months after the jailing of nine Catalan separatist leaders prompted furious protests in the region. Prosecutors allege that the four defendants \u201cwere key players in hindering or seriously complicating the fulfilment of court orders with the aim of carrying out the secessionist plan\u201d. As the trial opened, Trapero was asked about his relationship with Puigdemont, who staged an illegal independence referendum and made a unilateral declaration of independence before fleeing Spain to avoid arrest. Trapero said he and the former regional premier had not been close and that their personal relationship was \u201cneither good nor bad\u201d. He also denied the prosecution\u2019s suggestions that his officers had failed to act properly when a huge crowd of pro-independence Catalans gathered outside the region\u2019s economy ministry as it was searched by Guardia Civil officers \u2013 a force that operates across Spain \u2013 in the run-up to the unilateral referendum. Trapero said his officers had not acted passively as the crowd moved in and trapped the Guardia Civil officers inside the building. He also recalled an angry phone call with Jordi S\u00e0nchez, who was then the head of the powerful pro-independence civil society group the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), which had called the demonstration. Trapero said S\u00e0nchez had criticised his handling of the situation, \u201cand I told him he wasn\u2019t going to tell me how to deploy my officers\u201d. He added: \u201cI can\u2019t accept this idea of passivity. You can\u2019t conclude that we didn\u2019t want to do anything. There were many scenarios. Maybe with more officers and planning we could have done things differently but it\u2019s not fair to suggest we only acted as mediators because it\u2019s not true.\u201d",

It took almost three years for the album to catch on, by which time Flack had had already released two more impressive solo albums, Chapter 2 and Quiet Fire. Flack\u2019s breakthrough came through a fluke. One day Clint Eastwood heard her version of Ewan MacColl\u2019s oft-recorded The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, which appeared on her debut, on his car radio. \u201cHe called me at home in Alexandria, Virginia,\u201d Flack wrote. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe Clint Eastwood was calling me. I almost passed out!\u201d</p> <p>He told her he wanted to use her record in a movie that would be his directorial debut, Play Misty For Me, a thriller about a female stalker that served as a kind of precursor to Fatal Attraction. \u201cHe wanted to use my song only in a part of the movie where there was pure and absolute love,\u201d wrote Flack. \u201cI told him OK, but that I wanted to re-record it because I thought it was too slow. He said: \u2018No, it\u2019s not.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The film became a hit, and so did the song (for which Eastwood paid just $2,000), ending up as Billboard\u2019s No 1 single for 1972. The next year, it won both the record and song of the year Grammy. And the First Take album shot to the top of Billboard\u2019s Top 200, selling nearly 2m copies in the process. By the time of her breakthrough, Flack was \u201cold\u201d by pop standards, 33, with a long history in music. She grew up in North Carolina, where her mother was a church organist who encouraged her daughter\u2019s interest in music. At nine, she began to play classical piano, which she continued studying through her time at Howard University, which she entered when she was just 15.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8_fLu2yrP4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d8_fLu2yrP4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>After graduating four years later, she began to teach music and English in her new home of Washington DC. By night, she sang and played piano at local clubs, having moved on from classical works to perform blues, folk and pop standards. At a popular local spot, Mr Henry\u2019s, she earned a loyal audience and, there, she was discovered by jazz singer/pianist Les McCann. He got her an audition with the label he recorded for, Atlantic Records, whose tsar, Ahmet Ertegun, signed her based on the massive repertoire of songs she not only performed but arranged. Working with producer Joel Dorn, who would later oversee Bette Midler\u2019s debut for Atlantic, she recorded her debut in 10 hours, a feat reflected in the album\u2019s title, First Take. The set featured just eight songs, unified by their languorous length and the singer\u2019s contemplative style. Yet, the compositions themselves varied widely.</p> <p>The opening, Compared to What, which had been recorded earlier by McCann, spat out a biting critique of the Vietnam war in a lyric that also attacked the public\u2019s apathy (\u201cWe\u2019re all chicken feathers / without one gut,\u201d Flack sniped, over her sarcastic piano). The song\u2019s socio-political focus found a kindred spirit in another piece on the album, Tryin\u2019 Times, co-written by Flack\u2019s college friend, singer Donny Hathaway. In between, she sang a song in Spanish, Angelitos Negros, interpreted a Leonard Cohen piece, Hey, That\u2019s No Way to Say Goodbye, and delivered another song co-written by Hathaway, Our Ages or Our Hearts, about an intergenerational love affair.</p> <p>Still, the most dramatic song was a seven-minute rumination called Ballad of the Sad Young Men, whose lyrics, by Fran Landesman, originally appeared in a 1959 musical about the Beat Generation titled The Nervous Set. A highly literate piece, the song spoke of lonely young men drawn to a bar where they forever seek \u201csomeone they can love / for just a little while\u201d. They\u2019re caught in a loop, \u201cdrinking up the night / trying not to drown,\u201d while \u201cchoking on their youth\u201d as age beckons. At the song\u2019s astounding climax, Flack hits a note of operatic power. \u201cFran Landesman is one of the greatest lyricists of all time,\u201d Flack wrote. \u201cI sang it about soldiers, then, later, about gay men. It touches me deeply every time. I used to perform this song at Mr Henry\u2019s and people would be totally silent. I knew it moved them.\u201d</p> <p>Performances like that, and those on the rest of the album, cast Flack as an ace cabaret interpreter. Only one track on the album, the traditional I Told Jesus, had any root in gospel music. Likewise, little of the music referenced gutsy soul. In the process, Flack upended every stereotype about the kinds of sounds an African American artist could successfully market. \u201cI didn\u2019t try to be a soul singer, a jazz singer, a blues singer \u2013 no category,\u201d Flack wrote. \u201cMy music is my expression of what I feel and believe in a moment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e0c4487ff4375dbbbd8be12da3ae68e93ab264c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0c4487ff4375dbbbd8be12da3ae68e93ab264c9/0_140_4080_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flack in 2013.\u2019I didn\u2019t try to be a soul singer, a jazz singer, a blues singer \u2013 no category.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flack in 2013: \u2018I didn\u2019t try to be a soul singer, a jazz singer, a blues singer \u2013 no category.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brad Barket/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a result, she sometimes endured accusations of being \u201ctoo white\u201d, a prejudicial view which, she admits, hurt. \u201cOf course, it did,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI hope that one day we will be seen for the people we are, not for our race, gender, age or nationality.\u201d</p> <p>She also endured criticism from the very person who wrote The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face.

To put it crudely, these things sounded to me, as a child under the age of 10, as sad but strange, with no connection to the safe kind of life I lived.</p> <p>A bit later, on a trip to Germany in 1957, my parents said that they were being taken on a visit somewhere that was too awful for my brother and I to go with them. It was Buchenwald. When my mother came back, her face was grey. She tried to explain that thousands of people were tortured and killed there, people like us: Jews. I was 11. I thought of a place I had visited a few weeks earlier: the torture room at the Tower of London. Again, I think now of how my mind worked then: using a horror that I knew as a way of trying to understand the horror my mother was talking about.</p> <p>All this was before the days of the internet, Wikipedia, documentaries about the Nazis on TV, or novels for children such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/23/judith-kerr-obituary\" title=\"\">Judith Kerr</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/27/hitler-pink-rabbit-judith-kerr-childrens-book\" title=\"\">When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit</a>.</p> <p>My childhood curiosity about the disappearances of my relatives turned into an adult quest, fuelled at first by irritation that nothing more was known other than my father saying he didn\u2019t know.

I\u2019d wonder, how could they have just disappeared? How could there only be a nothing? At weddings and wider family gatherings, we would meet his cousin Michael and later we would be told that Michael had been \u201cput on a train in Poland\u201d by his parents, been sent to a prison camp in the Soviet Union, fought with Polish forces in General Anders\u2019 army, and had somehow arrived on our aunt\u2019s doorstep in east London, but had never seen his parents again. Living in the London suburbs of the 1950s, I couldn\u2019t figure out how any of this could have happened. How could you lose your parents? When I am drawn into doing Holocaust education with children of the age I was then, I often think of how I heard these terrible things without understanding them or fully feeling them.

I thought of a place I had visited a few weeks earlier: the torture room at the Tower of London. Again, I think now of how my mind worked then: using a horror that I knew as a way of trying to understand the horror my mother was talking about.

For hospitals are largely places of cure, of restoring people to life and to time.

A doctor specialising in palliative medicine, she spends her days in a hospice where people come when all hope of a cure has gone. In her heart-wrenchingly tender and candid account of being alongside people at their endings, she shines a light into the world of the dying. Where her job used to be about saving lives and she often felt like she was battling in a war zone, now it is about accompanying people to their final threshold when the long fight is over, in a place of safety. While medical science remains imperative (with the miracles of modern drugs, few people need to die in agony), equally important is the imaginative kindness that the task requires, the imperative of seeing the patient as a vulnerable and beloved person, the ability to witness and sometimes carry the anguish of others and the great endeavour of enabling those in her care to meaningfully live until they painlessly cease.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Clarke repeatedly describes her own fallibility: the mistakes she makes, the fear and recoil she feels</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clarke is unerringly good at telling stories and <em>Dear Life</em> is full of them \u2013 of the young woman who 24 hours before her death joyfully got married in the hospice and died in her new husband\u2019s arms still dressed in her white chiffon; of the mother who was shown by one of the staff how to wash her 19-year-old son\u2019s dead body; of the distressingly agitated old man who found peace once the double doors had been opened and he had been turned to face the garden \u2013 but overarching them all are two larger stories.</p> <p>One (mirroring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/02/being-mortal-review-atul-gawande-death-palliative-care-alzheimers\" title=\"\">Atul Gawande</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/being-mortal-9781846685828.html\" title=\"\"><em>Being Mortal</em></a>, in which the death of a parent is the organising narrative) is the death of Clarke\u2019s adored father, a doctor and her role model and mentor. Her book opens with the diagnosis of his cancer and it closes with his beautifully managed ending, at home with his family around him. In this way, the chapters track her growing understanding of what it is to be frail and mortal creatures.</p> <p>The other is how Clarke, who in her 20s worked as a news reporter, became a doctor and then a specialist in palliative care. In much of the first half of <em>Dear Life</em>, she describes her time in frenzied A&amp;E departments, \u201camid the stabbed, the shot, the broken-boned, the overdosed, the dog-bitten, the knived, the burned and the impaled\u201d, where injury and death can seem random and brutal, endangered bodies are stacked in corridors, overworked and often exhausted doctors and nurses run rather than walk and a handful of seconds can make all the difference.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/12/atul-gawande-being-mortal-older-sicker-autonomy-interview\">Atul Gawande: \u2018Why, as you become older and sicker, should you give up your autonomy?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To work in a hospice felt like a welcome alternative to the traditional medical paradigm, \u201cone with people, not diseases, at its heart\u201d. Curiously, once she is writing about palliative care, not only does the crisis and clamour of acute medicine fade; so too the body, in all its mess and indignity and many frailties, recedes. Time slows down as it runs out. It is the gallant human heart that takes centre stage.</p> <p>Clarke repeatedly describes her own fallibility: the mistakes she makes, the fear and recoil she feels, the cases that go wrong. She lets us see her as a doctor, but also as a daughter, a wife, a mother. The compartments are not neat: she works as a scientist, but also as a counsellor, a teacher, a priest, a fellow human being. Her heart is in her job. There are many thrilling doctor-as-hero accounts, and they are often by men; there are fewer doctor-as-healer ones, and those I know of share the kind, unironic and emotionally invested quality of <em>Dear Life</em>.</p> <p>The title is appropriate. Clarke is writing about dying, but also, eloquently, about living. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/04/life-saul-bellow-fame-fortune-review-detailed-case-defence\" title=\"\">Saul Bellow</a> wrote that death is \u201cthe dark backing that a mirror needs if we are to see anything\u201d: it gives life its value and time its precious meaning. In Clarke\u2019s hospice, on good days, she sees her patients living as they approach their ends, freshly aware of life\u2019s everyday loveliness. And the passages in her book that made me want to weep were not the ones about dying, but the ones about living, loving, learning how to say goodbye.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Dear Life: A Doctor\u2019s Story of Love and Loss </em>by Rachel Clarke is published by Little, Brown (\u00a316.99).

Clarke is unerringly good at telling stories and Dear Life is full of them \u2013 of the young woman who 24 hours before her death joyfully got married in the hospice and died in her new husband\u2019s arms still dressed in her white chiffon; of the mother who was shown by one of the staff how to wash her 19-year-old son\u2019s dead body; of the distressingly agitated old man who found peace once the double doors had been opened and he had been turned to face the garden \u2013 but overarching them all are two larger stories. One (mirroring Atul Gawande\u2019s Being Mortal, in which the death of a parent is the organising narrative) is the death of Clarke\u2019s adored father, a doctor and her role model and mentor. Her book opens with the diagnosis of his cancer and it closes with his beautifully managed ending, at home with his family around him. In this way, the chapters track her growing understanding of what it is to be frail and mortal creatures. The other is how Clarke, who in her 20s worked as a news reporter, became a doctor and then a specialist in palliative care. In much of the first half of Dear Life, she describes her time in frenzied A&amp;E departments, \u201camid the stabbed, the shot, the broken-boned, the overdosed, the dog-bitten, the knived, the burned and the impaled\u201d, where injury and death can seem random and brutal, endangered bodies are stacked in corridors, overworked and often exhausted doctors and nurses run rather than walk and a handful of seconds can make all the difference. To work in a hospice felt like a welcome alternative to the traditional medical paradigm, \u201cone with people, not diseases, at its heart\u201d. Curiously, once she is writing about palliative care, not only does the crisis and clamour of acute medicine fade; so too the body, in all its mess and indignity and many frailties, recedes. Time slows down as it runs out. It is the gallant human heart that takes centre stage. Clarke repeatedly describes her own fallibility: the mistakes she makes, the fear and recoil she feels, the cases that go wrong. She lets us see her as a doctor, but also as a daughter, a wife, a mother. The compartments are not neat: she works as a scientist, but also as a counsellor, a teacher, a priest, a fellow human being. Her heart is in her job. There are many thrilling doctor-as-hero accounts, and they are often by men; there are fewer doctor-as-healer ones, and those I know of share the kind, unironic and emotionally invested quality of Dear Life. The title is appropriate. Clarke is writing about dying, but also, eloquently, about living. Saul Bellow wrote that death is \u201cthe dark backing that a mirror needs if we are to see anything\u201d: it gives life its value and time its precious meaning. In Clarke\u2019s hospice, on good days, she sees her patients living as they approach their ends, freshly aware of life\u2019s everyday loveliness. And the passages in her book that made me want to weep were not the ones about dying, but the ones about living, loving, learning how to say goodbye. \u2022 Dear Life: A Doctor\u2019s Story of Love and Loss by Rachel Clarke is published by Little, Brown (\u00a316.99).

      "body": "<p>For purveyors of snake oil, January is an especially lucrative month. Fresh from our festive excesses, our bodily insecurities are readily exploited by those looking to make a quick buck from a worthless ware. This month has already seen the unedifying sight of a Kardashian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drg1985/status/1215025118851796999\">pushing a \u201cflat-tummy\u201d shake to her 27.7 million Twitter followers</a>, while Netflix has abandoned any pretension of quality-control by allowing the actor Gwyneth Paltrow <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/1/10/21056426/gwyneth-paltrow-is-straight-up-trolling-her-critics-now\">her own show</a>, effectively a glorified promotional vehicle for Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle brand Goop.</p> <p>For those so inclined, Paltrow sells all manner of pseudoscientific regimes, from \u201cjade eggs\u201d (essentially rocks that Paltrow recommends women carry in their vagina, despite gynaecologists <a href=\"https://drjengunter.com/2017/01/17/dear-gwyneth-paltrow-im-a-gyn-and-your-vaginal-jade-eggs-are-a-bad-idea/\">imploring people</a> not to do this) to \u201chealing stickers\u201d to a $75 candle that ostensibly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/13/why-is-gwyneth-paltrow-selling-a-candle-that-smells-like-her-vagina-goop\">smells of Paltrow\u2019s vagina</a>. Sadly, neither repeated admonishment by scientists and doctors <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gwyneth-platrows-goop-lawsuit-vaginal-egg-claims-2018-9?r=US&amp;IR=T\">nor a lawsuit against Goop</a> for medically unsupported claims have done anything to impede their popularity, and the candles have already sold out, as did the jade eggs before them.</p> <p>Across social media, influencers perpetuate wellness trends and dubious diets, frequently promoting completely useless or even dangerous advice. The perennial market for \u201cdetox\u201d and \u201ccleanse\u201d diets and products is a recurrent theme. As has been written <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/18/angry-chef-debunking-detox-diets-wellness-nutrition-alternative-facts\">frequently here</a>, these are completely useless from a scientific standpoint, given our liver and kidneys filter toxins quite admirably. Despite this, detox products and their offspring diets <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/11/juice-cleanses-not-healthy-not-virtuous-just-expensive.html\">top $5bn</a> in sales annually, driven to a large extent by celebrity and influencer endorsement. </p> <p>If celebrity itself is a nebulous term, influencer is an even more amorphous and vague dystopian concept; one <a href=\"https://businessteacher.org.uk/assignments/influence-of-youtubers-on-buying-decision-in-beauty-industry.php\">fitting and ominous definition</a> describes the role as a \u201cthird party who significantly shapes the customer\u2019s purchasing decision but may never be accountable for it\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to laugh and utter something about fools and their money, but it is undeniable that celebrity influence has a tangible effect on public perception. Jade Goody\u2019s untimely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/22/jade-goody-dies\">death from cervical cancer</a> in 2009 is a case in point. During her ordeal, appointments for cervical smears surged by up to 70% above projected figures, resulting in an estimated extra 500,000 screenings in the UK. Dubbed the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/oct/22/jade-goody-cervical-cancer-screening\">Goody effect</a>\u201d, the rise was particularly pronounced in those from lower socioeconomic groups, whom public health campaigns frequently miss.</p> <p>The reason for the surge was probably down to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic\">availability heuristic</a>, the phenomenon by which immediate and easily accessed information is afforded a greater weight. Consequently, we tend to skew our judgments toward more recent information, biasing our opinions towards the latest news or most easily accessed example. But conversely, as examples become less vivid and recent they dissipate from our collective consciousness. By 2017, once public memory of Goody\u2019s plight had faded, cervical screening in the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2018/jan/21/whatever-happened-to-the-jade-goody-effect\">fell to a 19-year low</a>.</p> <p>Crucially, celebrity coverage appears to be what affects screening statistics, not any inherent benefit of the test itself. And unfortunately, this increased focus is not always beneficial; following Kylie Minogue\u2019s breast cancer diagnosis in 2005, requests for mammograms in Australia <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16138798\">more than doubled</a>. Yet this was in many respects detrimental, as the vast majority of these requests came from young women, for whom screening was likely to yield <a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2480757/screening-breast-cancer-u-s-preventive-services-task-force-recommendation\">false positives and needless invasive procedures.</a></p> <p>Nor did the increased discussion of breast cancer correlate with improved understanding; as with most cancers, age is the greatest risk factor for breast malignancies, and the overwhelming majority occur in older patients. As Lesley Walker of Cancer Research UK <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6076642.stm\">cautioned</a>, the net effect of celebrity-skewed coverage can \u201cset up a chain of panic among young women, while misleading older women to think that ageing is not a relevant factor in breast cancer\u201d.</p> <p>But while endorsing relatively inert quackery is one thing, it is an order of magnitude worse when a celebrity uses their platform to push debunked nonsense. This is perhaps most prevalent on vaccination, where it is not uncommon for celebrities to push discredited and dangerous narratives on social media and on air.

That\u2019s more than the psychological boost you get from finding a new job or a new life partner.</p> <p>And that makes it highly significant, explains economist Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, professor at Sa\u00efd Business School in Oxford and director of the Oxford University Wellbeing Research Centre, who <a href=\"http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1671.pdf\">conducted the study</a>. \u201cWe know a lot about what drives wellbeing, and we know a lot about mental health issues in our society and the fact that they\u2019re on the increase, despite improving economic conditions,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cBut what hasn\u2019t been properly looked at until now is what can make a difference \u2013 what can move the dial on life satisfaction in a meaningful and sustained way.\u201d</p> <p>Like Newstead, he wasn\u2019t sure how much difference a short course of eight sessions could make when he started his randomised control trial involving 146 people. \u201cBut the results were really impressive \u2013 the course delivers significant improvements in wellbeing and reductions in mental health symptoms,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this intervention has huge potential and really does work.\u201d</p> <p>So how does the course work? Another of its graduates is Rebecca Newey, 47, who lives near Aldershot.</p> <p>She was feeling angry, suffering mood swings and snapping at her husband and two sons, aged 12 and 10, when she signed up for the happiness course two years ago after hearing about it from another mother at the school gate. \u201cThe sessions start with being mindful: you stop what you\u2019re doing and notice how you\u2019re breathing. And then there\u2019s a structured discussion about how to feel happier: so you\u2019re with a bunch of people who are all aspiring to be happier, and there\u2019s power in that.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most important things she learned, says Newey, was how to react to an event. \u201cYou choose how to respond to something, and your gut reaction isn\u2019t always the best way to react. You learn to take a moment to breathe, and to make a decision about what to do next.\u201d</p> <p>That knowledge continues to make a difference in her life. \u201cThe other day my car had a flat tyre. Two years ago I\u2019d have moaned and thought it was the end of the world: instead, I started to count my blessings. The previous day I\u2019d been on a motorway, so it was good it hadn\u2019t happened then; and it happened when my husband was around, so it wasn\u2019t leaving me in the lurch unable to pick up the children.\u201d</p> <p>So is finding happiness, in essence, a lot easier than we\u2019ve been led to believe?

      "bodyText": "When an email popped up in Jo Newstead\u2019s inbox promising a course that could make her happier, she was \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 sceptical. \u201cBut then I thought, what have I got to lose?\u201d she says. In her early 60s, she\u2019d recently lost a close friend, and had stopped working. \u201cI was at a crossroads, with a lot to deal with \u2013 but I wasn\u2019t at all sure a course could help.\u201d She went along to the first session, she says, with her arms folded, pretty certain she wouldn\u2019t be back. So what made her end up cancelling parties so she could get to the classes \u2013 and why is she now a stalwart of the ongoing monthly get-togethers with her other happiness graduates? In a nutshell, she says, the course helped her understand how to view life through a positive rather than a negative lens. It gave her strategies to cope when things seemed to be going into a downward spiral, as well as a supportive environment and the space to talk things through. \u201cIt sounds trite and airy-fairy, but it was anything but \u2013 it was really useful, and very genuine,\u201d she says.

      "body": "<p>Apple\u2019s new 16in MacBook Pro is bigger and heavier, but that\u2019s a very good thing, with the largest battery you can have in a laptop and a new keyboard that looks to kick the troubles of the past few years to the kerb.</p> <p>It\u2019s a bit of a U-turn from Apple and demonstrates that the Californian tech firm is finally listening to its hardcore audience: the professionals.</p> <p>The 16in MacBook Pro is the largest, most expensive laptop that Apple makes and is a direct replacement for the 15in MacBook Pro that was made up until November 2019. Starting at \u00a32,399 and reaching \u00a35,769 with all the options ticked, it\u2019s clear this is no ordinary computer for general users.</p> <p>This is a machine is designed for developers, video editors, sound engineers and other people working in industries that demand power and performance for as long as possible.</p> <p>But there are two new things that might interest general buyers as a preview of what\u2019s likely to come to Apple\u2019s other laptops that are more suitable general computers: a new keyboard and a new battery.</p> <h2>Thicker, heavier and better</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2d994ef38976bbb4ee818899e416f8f133529b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2d994ef38976bbb4ee818899e416f8f133529b8/0_100_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple 16in macbook pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The design remains broadly the same, despite being larger with some important tweaks to crucial parts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fundamentally the design of the MacBook Pro hasn\u2019t changed much since the introduction of the fourth-generation machine in late 2016. From the outside it looks practically identical, except it\u2019s ever-so-slightly bigger than the 15in MacBook Pro.</p> <p>This fifth-generation machine is 8.6mm wider, 5.2mm deeper, 0.7mm thicker and 170g heavier than the old version, increasing the screen size from 15.4in to a round 16in on the diagonal. It has the same four Thunderbolt 3 ports and still has a headphone socket. The keyboard has different mechanisms under the keys but is otherwise very similar, as is the gigantic trackpad. Apple makes the best trackpads in the business and this one is no different.</p> <p>On the audio front the speakers and mics have been upgraded. The machine now comes with a six-speaker system built into it, which are still laptop speakers and won\u2019t replace a set of headphones or a dedicated sound system, but sound phenomenal for what they are.</p> <p>A three-mic array is capable of beamforming, cancelling background noise and is of high-enough quality that you don\u2019t necessarily need to reach for a dedicated microphone for impromptu recording sessions.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Screen:</strong> 16in LCD 3072x1920 (226 ppi)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Processor:</strong> 9th gen 6-core Intel Core i7 or 8-core Intel Core i9</p></li> <li><p><strong>RAM:</strong> 16, 32 or 64GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> 512GB, 1, 2, 4 or 8TB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel UHD 630 + AMD Radeon Pro 5300M or Radeon Pro 5500M</p></li> <li><p><strong>Operating system:</strong> macOS Catalina</p></li> <li><p><strong>Camera:</strong> 720p FaceTime HD camera</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> wifi ac, Bluetooth 5, 4x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3, headphone</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 245.9 x 357.9 x 16.2mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 2kg</p></li> </ul> <h2>The new Magic Keyboard</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"431011daf7ae25479449282f445066cb195653cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/431011daf7ae25479449282f445066cb195653cd/0_182_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple 16in macbook pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Magic keyboard is great, and hopefully will be free of issues from Apple\u2019s butterfly keyboard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much has been written about Apple\u2019s recent laptop keyboards. The butterfly keyboard introduced with the 2015 MacBook was thinner, crisper, louder and with only a small amount of travel. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/12/apple-macbook-pro-review-the-best-computer-you-shouldnt-buy\">I quite liked it</a>, but it was plagued with failures due to dust getting under the keys and stopping them from depressing.</p> <p>The 16in MacBook Pro has a new \u201cmagic keyboard\u201d that moves back to the traditional scissor switches used by older Apple laptops and practically every other manufacturer. The keys are more stable and the travel is slightly shallower than Apple\u2019s pre-butterfly keyboards, arriving at a nice combination of the best bits of the butterfly and scissor-switch keyboards.</p> <p>Most will like the feel. It\u2019s stable and has enough travel. It\u2019s also <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/16-inch-macbook-pro-magic-keyboard-throwback\">easier to repair</a>, so while it shouldn\u2019t suffer from the same dust issues plaguing the butterfly keyboard, at least it should be easier to fix if something goes wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5276bd477f77feed9a864130273ec0f093f98c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5276bd477f77feed9a864130273ec0f093f98c3/0_153_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple 16in macbook pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The escape key makes a triumphant return.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apple has also added a dedicated ESC key in the top left, which is separated from the Touch Bar. This is something developers in particular have asked for and was a welcome addition for the Guardian\u2019s developers\u2019 team.</p> <p>The direction arrows are now back in an inverted T arrangement, too, which was a frequent request. The Touch ID fingerprint scanner has also been separated from the Touch Bar, which led to far fewer accidental triggers of Siri \u2013 the first key by default on the Touch Bar \u2013 when I attempted to authenticate something with my fingerprint.</p> <h2>The 16in screen</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"893384929a2699a879a1361344feb37fadb1eca0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/893384929a2699a879a1361344feb37fadb1eca0/0_0_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple 16in macbook pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Touch Bar continues to be as useful or not depending on the software you have to use, with most tools available through it in Affinity Photo, for instance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The screen is marginally bigger at 16in on the diagonal rather than 15.4in, although you can only really tell side by side. The display has a higher resolution, which provides slightly more screen real estate in use, as well as being slightly crisper on paper with a density of 226 pixels per inch (up from 220ppi).</p> <p>On the whole it\u2019s one of the nicest displays I\u2019ve used on a laptop. Rich, bright, easy to use in most lighting conditions, it is individually calibrated at the factory and it has a mode that simulates high dynamic range. But it is not a true HDR display nor is it 4K, which may be an issue for those looking to work with content in both although most will likely transition to an dedicated edit suite for serious work.

      "bodyText": "Apple\u2019s new 16in MacBook Pro is bigger and heavier, but that\u2019s a very good thing, with the largest battery you can have in a laptop and a new keyboard that looks to kick the troubles of the past few years to the kerb. It\u2019s a bit of a U-turn from Apple and demonstrates that the Californian tech firm is finally listening to its hardcore audience: the professionals. The 16in MacBook Pro is the largest, most expensive laptop that Apple makes and is a direct replacement for the 15in MacBook Pro that was made up until November 2019. Starting at \u00a32,399 and reaching \u00a35,769 with all the options ticked, it\u2019s clear this is no ordinary computer for general users. This is a machine is designed for developers, video editors, sound engineers and other people working in industries that demand power and performance for as long as possible. But there are two new things that might interest general buyers as a preview of what\u2019s likely to come to Apple\u2019s other laptops that are more suitable general computers: a new keyboard and a new battery. Thicker, heavier and better Fundamentally the design of the MacBook Pro hasn\u2019t changed much since the introduction of the fourth-generation machine in late 2016. From the outside it looks practically identical, except it\u2019s ever-so-slightly bigger than the 15in MacBook Pro. This fifth-generation machine is 8.6mm wider, 5.2mm deeper, 0.7mm thicker and 170g heavier than the old version, increasing the screen size from 15.4in to a round 16in on the diagonal. It has the same four Thunderbolt 3 ports and still has a headphone socket. The keyboard has different mechanisms under the keys but is otherwise very similar, as is the gigantic trackpad. Apple makes the best trackpads in the business and this one is no different. On the audio front the speakers and mics have been upgraded. The machine now comes with a six-speaker system built into it, which are still laptop speakers and won\u2019t replace a set of headphones or a dedicated sound system, but sound phenomenal for what they are. A three-mic array is capable of beamforming, cancelling background noise and is of high-enough quality that you don\u2019t necessarily need to reach for a dedicated microphone for impromptu recording sessions. Specifications Screen: 16in LCD 3072x1920 (226 ppi) Processor: 9th gen 6-core Intel Core i7 or 8-core Intel Core i9 RAM: 16, 32 or 64GB Storage: 512GB, 1, 2, 4 or 8TB Graphics: Intel UHD 630 + AMD Radeon Pro 5300M or Radeon Pro 5500M Operating system: macOS Catalina Camera: 720p FaceTime HD camera Connectivity: wifi ac, Bluetooth 5, 4x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3, headphone Dimensions: 245.9 x 357.9 x 16.2mm Weight: 2kg The new Magic Keyboard Much has been written about Apple\u2019s recent laptop keyboards. The butterfly keyboard introduced with the 2015 MacBook was thinner, crisper, louder and with only a small amount of travel. I quite liked it, but it was plagued with failures due to dust getting under the keys and stopping them from depressing. The 16in MacBook Pro has a new \u201cmagic keyboard\u201d that moves back to the traditional scissor switches used by older Apple laptops and practically every other manufacturer. The keys are more stable and the travel is slightly shallower than Apple\u2019s pre-butterfly keyboards, arriving at a nice combination of the best bits of the butterfly and scissor-switch keyboards. Most will like the feel. It\u2019s stable and has enough travel. It\u2019s also easier to repair, so while it shouldn\u2019t suffer from the same dust issues plaguing the butterfly keyboard, at least it should be easier to fix if something goes wrong. Apple has also added a dedicated ESC key in the top left, which is separated from the Touch Bar. This is something developers in particular have asked for and was a welcome addition for the Guardian\u2019s developers\u2019 team. The direction arrows are now back in an inverted T arrangement, too, which was a frequent request. The Touch ID fingerprint scanner has also been separated from the Touch Bar, which led to far fewer accidental triggers of Siri \u2013 the first key by default on the Touch Bar \u2013 when I attempted to authenticate something with my fingerprint. The 16in screen The screen is marginally bigger at 16in on the diagonal rather than 15.4in, although you can only really tell side by side. The display has a higher resolution, which provides slightly more screen real estate in use, as well as being slightly crisper on paper with a density of 226 pixels per inch (up from 220ppi). On the whole it\u2019s one of the nicest displays I\u2019ve used on a laptop. Rich, bright, easy to use in most lighting conditions, it is individually calibrated at the factory and it has a mode that simulates high dynamic range. But it is not a true HDR display nor is it 4K, which may be an issue for those looking to work with content in both although most will likely transition to an dedicated edit suite for serious work. The MacBook Pro does support output to up to two 6K or four 4K displays simultaneously, for those who use this as their sole machine working at a desk. 100Wh of battery Other than the slightly bigger screen and marginally thicker keyboard, the majority of the increased weight and thickness of the 16in MacBook Pro is down to its significantly larger battery. There\u2019s a cap on the size of battery allowed on a flight of 100Wh and that\u2019s what Apple has fitted here, just shy of a 20% increase from the 83.6Wh battery in the previous generation machine. Battery life on a machine like this entirely depends on what you\u2019re using for. The laptop would manage a full nine-hour work day of writing, browser tabs, image editing and a suite of chat apps, both work and personal open, with the screen set to 75% brightness on battery power with about 10% left. But you\u2019re looking more like a few hours of video editing, which is more than enough for quick adjustments in the field in between connections to a power socket. The larger battery was welcomed by the Guardian\u2019s video team, who said the increased weight was negligible in the grand scheme of things. Observations This is a big, heavy machine, which means while you can lug it about everywhere, it\u2019s likely to be used mostly at a desk You can only record three fingerprints on the Touch ID sensor You can run the machine with the lid closed perfectly fine, which makes it suitable for slotting into docking stations Price The 16in MacBook Pro starts at \u00a32,399 with a 6-core Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and an AMD Radeon Pro 5300M with 4GB of VRAM. The laptop as tested cost \u00a33,789 equipped with an 8-core Intel Core i9, 32GB of RAM, 2TB of storage and an AMD Radeon Pro 5500M with 8GB of VRAM. For comparison, the 15in Razer Blade Studio Edition costs \u00a33,999.99, the Dell XPS 15 with an Intel Core i7 starts at under \u00a31,500. Verdict If you were looking for a new Mac laptop as a workstation, but were put off buying one because of the troubles with the keyboard, or that it just didn\u2019t last long enough to get whatever you needed to done in the field, the 16in MacBook Pro is the answer. Aside from the new keyboard, it\u2019s clear Apple has listened to at least a few requests from power users. The escape key is back by popular demand, as is the T-shaped layout of the arrow keys, while a separated power/Touch ID button is much more user friendly. You can even fix some things without fully dismantling the machine, which is a step forward. There\u2019s still no SD card slot or any port option not USB-C but by now most will have hubs, dongles or new replacement cables for the necessary things. The 16in MacBook Pro is most certainly not the laptop for general users who just want a big screen \u2013 the price alone should be able to tell you that. But if you know you need this sort of capability, then the MacBook Pro is in a similar price bracket to competitors and can be specified with a frankly absurd amount of capacity, which might make the difference. The first of the fifth-generation MacBook Pros is a return to form for Apple, and bodes well for further refreshes of the company\u2019s slightly more affordable laptop lines expected in the near future. Pros: good keyboard compromise, escape key, t-shape arrow keys, 100Wh battery, gorgeous screen, brilliant trackpad, powerful and customisable (at point of purchase), USB-C/Thunderbolt 3, Touch ID Cons: fairly heavy for some, no card slot or legacy ports, no user-serviceable RAM or storage, no Face ID Other reviews Apple 13in MacBook Pro (2017) review: battery life to get through a working day Apple MacBook Air review: the new default Mac Microsoft Surface Book 2 review: a powerful yet pricey laptop-tablet combo",

I don\u2019t believe they have any intent to endanger life or property.</p> <p>If I was told I had to, as part of my job, I would contest that. If the point was pushed, I would involve my union, which would support me.</p> <p>Suggesting that peaceful protesters from Extinction Rebellion are somehow equivalent morally to far-right activists who seek to intimidate and spread hate and fear is offensive and, frankly, silly.</p> <p>To include Extinction Rebellion in a list alongside terrorist organisations criminalises precisely the intelligent, thinking young people most likely to be an asset to the country in the future.</p> <p>If I believed a young person had the motive, the intent and the ability to cause criminal damage or to endanger life, I would deal with that as a matter of urgency. I would not report them for an Extinction Rebellion logo on a schoolbag or for an interest in Greta Thunberg.</p> <h2><strong>Roshan Doug</strong></h2> <p><strong>Education consultant</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e2ffa9011ccbd03a94e40eee5bfc40f9713bca0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2ffa9011ccbd03a94e40eee5bfc40f9713bca0e/4_56_743_743/500.jpg\" alt=\"Roshan Doug.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Yes, if the student was breaking the law or was likely to endanger other people or themselves. If Extinction Rebellion was categorised as an extremist organisation on the Prevent list, I would report a student who was a member of it.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think I would report a student for going on a peaceful protest. It depends on what he or she was going to do. If it starts interfering with transport or impinging on people\u2019s ability to get to work, causing havoc and inconvenience, that would be a concern for me.</p> <p>I think parts of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s ideology are extreme. There are certain people who are blowing up [the issue of climate emergency], like a certain young girl, Greta Thunberg, who is accusing our generation of messing up the world and saying we should be ashamed of ourselves. </p> <p>Too many teachers have a leftwing agenda. Some are allowing youngsters to miss a whole day of lessons to protest. That is irresponsible. </p> <p>Everyone talks about the changing climate and its effects, but there are countries that don\u2019t take it at face value. In Russia and India, educationists do not put forward this idea that there\u2019s climate change taking place and it\u2019s going to affect the world, and we are going to be flooded in 30 or 40 years.</p> <p>I think students don\u2019t really question, in a critical way, the information about climate change they are being fed through the education system and the media. I don\u2019t understand how 16- or 17-year-olds know enough about it to be protesting. I would like to see youngsters being more sceptical about the information that is being given to them.</p> <h2><strong>Niamh Sweeney</strong></h2> <p><strong>Teacher, Long Road sixth-form college, Cambridge</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d61384a7f1b16dabd621a05e37af7f65d8808ce9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d61384a7f1b16dabd621a05e37af7f65d8808ce9/0_628_3840_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Niamh Sweeney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I would report someone for extremism, because extremism is the opposition to rule of law, liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of faiths and beliefs. It would be a safeguarding concern.</p> <p>But involvement in climate activism \u2013 absolutely not. I want my students to be radical thinkers. Students getting involved in political issues is really important to their personal development.</p> <p>Extremism, for me, is about behaviour \u2013 particularly with regard to risk-taking or acts that could be deemed terrorism or illegal. For example, the climate extremists who climbed on top of a train: I would have safeguarding concerns about behaviour like that.</p> <p>If one of my students were contemplating doing something that risked their lives or the lives of others, I would perceive that as extremism and I would consider reporting them. Initially, though, I would have a conversation with them. Safeguarding concerns are unlikely to arise overnight - there are often changes in behaviour over time that teachers notice.</p> <p>I would not consider Extinction Rebellion to be extremism. We have to be really careful not to label something as extreme just because we don\u2019t like it.</p> <h2><strong>Lee Jones</strong></h2> <p><strong>(not her real name) Art teacher, Greater London</strong></p> <p>No. I am an Extinction Rebellion (XR) activist myself and, as a teacher, I\u2019m horrified by the prospect of teachers being asked to report students supporting XR as extremists.</p> <p>I would not report them and I would feel incredibly compromised, professionally, if I was asked to. If that was part of my role as a teacher, I would be wholly uncomfortable with it. I would rather quit my job.</p> <p>As educators, we have a duty to make sure students know about the extent of the climate crisis and are armed with the facts. The young people I\u2019ve met through XR and the climate strikes have, without exception, been passionate, well-informed and articulate. They are also genuinely fearful about climate change and I think their reactions are entirely proportionate. I don\u2019t think we should be reporting them or locking them up. I think we should be championing these young people, because they\u2019re compassionate and responsible. We have so much to learn from them.</p> <h2><strong>Malcolm Wilson</strong></h2> <p><strong>Primary school teacher, Buckinghamshire</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"07688c95a8c01ee9da6c0ed7c0efdb4c5804a654\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07688c95a8c01ee9da6c0ed7c0efdb4c5804a654/497_276_2744_2744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Wilson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I would report an eco-terrorist who was planning to do something dangerous. But I would not report a student for being a member of Extinction Rebellion. I would, however, report a child for changes in their behaviour or anything they said or did that led me to believe they were moving away from straightforward protest into extremism.</p> <p>I am a Quaker and one of my beliefs is that I must care for the planet. If guidance was issued to me from the police suggesting that Extinction Rebellion was an extremist organisation, I would ask for evidence. If the evidence was not forthcoming and it was clear this was a politically motivated decision as opposed to a real risk-based decision, as a Quaker, I might be guided by my beliefs to break the law and not report the child. And I would accept the consequences of that.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 January 2020. The original said that Roshan Doug was an education academic at the University of Birmingham.

      "bodyText": "Counter-terror police issued guidance requiring teachers to report members of Extinction Rebellion to the authorities under the Prevent powers. The guide was recalled after the Guardian revealed its existence, but later another list emerged citing the group, as well as Greenpeace and Stop the Badger Cull. Ed Finch Teacher, Larkrise primary school, Oxford No. While I would report a pupil for extremism if I believed they had motive, intent and ability to endanger property or life, I know numerous people who are involved in Extinction Rebellion, including pupils. I don\u2019t believe they have any intent to endanger life or property. If I was told I had to, as part of my job, I would contest that. If the point was pushed, I would involve my union, which would support me. Suggesting that peaceful protesters from Extinction Rebellion are somehow equivalent morally to far-right activists who seek to intimidate and spread hate and fear is offensive and, frankly, silly. To include Extinction Rebellion in a list alongside terrorist organisations criminalises precisely the intelligent, thinking young people most likely to be an asset to the country in the future. If I believed a young person had the motive, the intent and the ability to cause criminal damage or to endanger life, I would deal with that as a matter of urgency. I would not report them for an Extinction Rebellion logo on a schoolbag or for an interest in Greta Thunberg. Roshan Doug Education consultant Yes, if the student was breaking the law or was likely to endanger other people or themselves. If Extinction Rebellion was categorised as an extremist organisation on the Prevent list, I would report a student who was a member of it. I don\u2019t think I would report a student for going on a peaceful protest. It depends on what he or she was going to do. If it starts interfering with transport or impinging on people\u2019s ability to get to work, causing havoc and inconvenience, that would be a concern for me. I think parts of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s ideology are extreme. There are certain people who are blowing up [the issue of climate emergency], like a certain young girl, Greta Thunberg, who is accusing our generation of messing up the world and saying we should be ashamed of ourselves. Too many teachers have a leftwing agenda. Some are allowing youngsters to miss a whole day of lessons to protest. That is irresponsible. Everyone talks about the changing climate and its effects, but there are countries that don\u2019t take it at face value. In Russia and India, educationists do not put forward this idea that there\u2019s climate change taking place and it\u2019s going to affect the world, and we are going to be flooded in 30 or 40 years. I think students don\u2019t really question, in a critical way, the information about climate change they are being fed through the education system and the media. I don\u2019t understand how 16- or 17-year-olds know enough about it to be protesting. I would like to see youngsters being more sceptical about the information that is being given to them. Niamh Sweeney Teacher, Long Road sixth-form college, Cambridge I would report someone for extremism, because extremism is the opposition to rule of law, liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of faiths and beliefs. It would be a safeguarding concern. But involvement in climate activism \u2013 absolutely not. I want my students to be radical thinkers. Students getting involved in political issues is really important to their personal development. Extremism, for me, is about behaviour \u2013 particularly with regard to risk-taking or acts that could be deemed terrorism or illegal. For example, the climate extremists who climbed on top of a train: I would have safeguarding concerns about behaviour like that. If one of my students were contemplating doing something that risked their lives or the lives of others, I would perceive that as extremism and I would consider reporting them. Initially, though, I would have a conversation with them. Safeguarding concerns are unlikely to arise overnight - there are often changes in behaviour over time that teachers notice. I would not consider Extinction Rebellion to be extremism. We have to be really careful not to label something as extreme just because we don\u2019t like it. Lee Jones (not her real name) Art teacher, Greater London No. I am an Extinction Rebellion (XR) activist myself and, as a teacher, I\u2019m horrified by the prospect of teachers being asked to report students supporting XR as extremists. I would not report them and I would feel incredibly compromised, professionally, if I was asked to. If that was part of my role as a teacher, I would be wholly uncomfortable with it. I would rather quit my job. As educators, we have a duty to make sure students know about the extent of the climate crisis and are armed with the facts. The young people I\u2019ve met through XR and the climate strikes have, without exception, been passionate, well-informed and articulate. They are also genuinely fearful about climate change and I think their reactions are entirely proportionate. I don\u2019t think we should be reporting them or locking them up. I think we should be championing these young people, because they\u2019re compassionate and responsible. We have so much to learn from them. Malcolm Wilson Primary school teacher, Buckinghamshire I would report an eco-terrorist who was planning to do something dangerous. But I would not report a student for being a member of Extinction Rebellion. I would, however, report a child for changes in their behaviour or anything they said or did that led me to believe they were moving away from straightforward protest into extremism. I am a Quaker and one of my beliefs is that I must care for the planet. If guidance was issued to me from the police suggesting that Extinction Rebellion was an extremist organisation, I would ask for evidence. If the evidence was not forthcoming and it was clear this was a politically motivated decision as opposed to a real risk-based decision, as a Quaker, I might be guided by my beliefs to break the law and not report the child. And I would accept the consequences of that. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 January 2020. The original said that Roshan Doug was an education academic at the University of Birmingham. Doug holds a doctorate in education from the university but he is not on its academic staff.",

Many targets and deadlines for taking action are pegged to 2020, and governments and businesses will have to answer for any failure to meet those goals. The world is changing and leaders in all spheres are recognising that people are no longer willing to passively accept environmental destruction.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what to look out for in 2020.</p> <h2>Climate</h2> <p>Nearly five years have passed since the signing of the Paris agreement pledging to prevent global heating of more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. Since then, progress has stalled. Last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world\">UN climate conference</a> in Madrid ended inconclusively with no agreement on some basic aspects of implementing Paris. More importantly, countries\u2019 commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions under the 2015 accord are inadequate to stay within the 2C limit and would lead to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/world-on-track-for-3c-of-warming-under-current-global-climate-pledges-warns-un\">disastrous 3C </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/world-on-track-for-3c-of-warming-under-current-global-climate-pledges-warns-un\">rise</a>.</p> <p>That makes this year\u2019s climate summit the biggest since Paris. Governments must come to <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/10/glasgow-to-host-key-un-summit-on-tackling-climate-crisis\">COP26 in Glasgow</a> </strong><strong>in November</strong> armed with new emissions targets commensurate to the risk of climate breakdown. If Donald Trump is still in power, other countries must press ahead without the US and face down challenges to the Paris accord from Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Russia and others. That will be a massive struggle, and strong clear messages from civil society will be vital to its success.</p> <h2>US presidential election</h2> <p>Trump has blasted through federal protections ranging from clean air and water to Alaskan drilling and pipeline construction, and if he wins a second term he is likely to continue on that track. In international terms his influence has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/31/paris-climate-deal-trump-exit-resistance\">baleful on climate action</a>: he started the formal process to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/31/donald-trump-withdraw-paris-climate-change-agreement\">withdraw the US</a> from the Paris climate agreement in 2017, and that decision that will come into effect the day after the <strong>presidential election on 3 November</strong>. COP26 begins on 9 November and the US delegation will be drawn from the Trump White House whatever the election outcome. British diplomats will be looking to use the supposedly friendly relationship between Trump and Boris Johnson to try to ensure the US does not play a disruptive role.</p> <p>Trump will also preside over the <strong>G7 meeting in June</strong>, which means environmental issues will be off the agenda. In some previous years, notably 2005-07, the then G8\u2019s focus on the climate proved a valuable spur to progress in the UN climate talks. This year that will be missing.</p> <h2>Oceans</h2> <p>Plastic pollution, overfishing, overheating and acidification from climate change are driving a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/20/marine-life-oceans-extinction-threat\">crisis in the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/20/marine-life-oceans-extinction-threat\">oceans</a>. The <strong>World Ocean Summit in early March </strong>in Tokyo will set out the latest science on ocean health and present possible solutions. Later that month, from 23 March to 3 April, comes the final scheduled meeting of the UN effort to draft a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/22/un-poised-to-move-ahead-with-landmark-treaty-to-protect-high-seas\">new global treaty</a> on the seas. IGC4 aims to set out a new legally binding instrument on \u201cthe conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction\u201d.</p> <h2>Biodiversity</h2> <p>Ecosystems around the world, from the Amazon to the Antarctic, are on the verge of collapse owing to human encroachment and exploitation, pollution, water scarcity and the impacts of global heating. </p> <p>Two meetings will focus attention on the loss of biodiversity and ways to stem further destruction. The <strong>World Conservation Congress in mid-June</strong> in Marseille is a four-yearly meeting of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the organisation that compiles the global red lists of endangered and threatened species.</p> <p>A series of meetings held under the UN convention on biological diversity will culminate in a meeting at Kunming, China, in October where progress \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 on protecting wildlife and plants will be assessed. The current global biodiversity action plan runs from 2011 to 2020 and its key aims are likely to be missed. A new action plan for the next decade should be adopted at the Kunming conference.</p> <h2>Sustainable development goals</h2> <p>The Paris agreement was not the only major international achievement of 2015: there was also the signing of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/sustainable-development-goals\">UN sustainable development goals</a>, a set of 17 plans to remedy social and environmental ills \u2013 including eliminating poverty and hunger, empowering women and girls, improving access to healthcare and education in developing countries, and providing access to clean water and sanitation. Most of the goals are pegged to 2030, and this year is a staging post to assess progress at the <strong>UN high-level political forum in New York in July</strong>.</p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>The last few years have seen a new wave of environmental activism targeting businesses, whether through divestment campaigns aimed at fossil fuel investors, arts sponsorship deals or direct action. That is likely to increase in 2020 as the impact has become clearer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/14/blackrock-says-climate-crisis-will-now-guide-its-investments\">BlackRock</a> made an unprecedented decision last week to start stepping out of investments with a high climate risk, and other funds will come under pressure to follow suit. There are a variety of ways people can make their views known to company boards, from questioning their pension funds to joining protests or even becoming a shareholder.</p> <h2>Transport and the climate emergency</h2> <p>Globalisation has led to a massive increase in carbon from shipping, which now represents 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions but will reach 17% by 2050 if unchecked. But shipping has been deliberately excluded from UN climate negotiations and little progress has been made in the last two decades on cutting greenhouse gases from one of the dirtiest forms of transport. At the <strong>International Maritime Organisation meeting in March</strong> in London, countries are supposed to come up with a new way forward to fulfil the UN agency\u2019s aims of halving shipping emissions by mid-century \u2013 a goal that campaigners say is still inadequate. Last year Extinction Rebellion led effective protests. This year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/14/un-agency-meets-to-tackle-pollution-and-emissions-by-ships\">decisions deferred last year</a> will come back to the agenda.</p> <h2>Deforestation</h2> <p>In 2010, companies from around the world joined forces on a target to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/17/biggest-food-brands-failing-goals-to-banish-palm-oil-deforestation\">banish deforestation </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/17/biggest-food-brands-failing-goals-to-banish-palm-oil-deforestation\">for palm oil</a> from their supply chains permanently by 2020. That target looks far from being met, but at the <strong>Consumer Goods Forum in June</strong> in London the signatory companies will have to explain their progress and what they hope to do to improve their performance. Palm oil is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/19/palm-oil-ingredient-biscuits-shampoo-environmental\">one of the biggest drivers</a> of deforestation, particularly in south-east Asia where wildlife ranging from the orangutan to the Sumatran elephant and rhino are being endangered. Consumers have the chance to make their views felt: nobody wants their grocery shopping to contribute to species loss, and there are ways to grow natural resources without causing ecological disaster. It is up to producer companies and retailers to make the difference.</p> <h2>EU green deal and China EU summit</h2> <p>The new European commission took office in Brussels late last year with one central promise: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/11/eu-aims-to-stir-global-action-with-pledge-on-climate-crisis\">green deal for Europe</a>, by which the whole of the European economy and EU regulations would be overhauled to put environmental protections at the heart of continued prosperity. Clean energy, transport and industry will create new green jobs to replace those lost in polluting industries, and citizens will enjoy cleaner air, water, a healthier natural environment and a stable climate. That is the goal, at least. Living up to that promise will involve hard choices and skilful diplomacy, and in the course of this year the European commission, member states and EU parliament will face a series of key votes and decisions.</p> <p>The EU will also play a leading role in COP26, and the <strong>EU-China summit pegged for mid-September</strong> in Leipzig in Germany will be key. With the US rejecting the Paris agreement, cooperation between the world\u2019s other biggest emitters will be vital, so the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/31/china-eu-climate-lead-paris-agreement\">EU must forge a partnership with China</a> or face failure at COP26.</p>",

The World Ocean Summit in early March in Tokyo will set out the latest science on ocean health and present possible solutions. Later that month, from 23 March to 3 April, comes the final scheduled meeting of the UN effort to draft a new global treaty on the seas. IGC4 aims to set out a new legally binding instrument on \u201cthe conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction\u201d. Biodiversity Ecosystems around the world, from the Amazon to the Antarctic, are on the verge of collapse owing to human encroachment and exploitation, pollution, water scarcity and the impacts of global heating. Two meetings will focus attention on the loss of biodiversity and ways to stem further destruction. The World Conservation Congress in mid-June in Marseille is a four-yearly meeting of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the organisation that compiles the global red lists of endangered and threatened species. A series of meetings held under the UN convention on biological diversity will culminate in a meeting at Kunming, China, in October where progress \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 on protecting wildlife and plants will be assessed.

Most of the goals are pegged to 2030, and this year is a staging post to assess progress at the UN high-level political forum in New York in July. Business The last few years have seen a new wave of environmental activism targeting businesses, whether through divestment campaigns aimed at fossil fuel investors, arts sponsorship deals or direct action. That is likely to increase in 2020 as the impact has become clearer. BlackRock made an unprecedented decision last week to start stepping out of investments with a high climate risk, and other funds will come under pressure to follow suit. There are a variety of ways people can make their views known to company boards, from questioning their pension funds to joining protests or even becoming a shareholder. Transport and the climate emergency Globalisation has led to a massive increase in carbon from shipping, which now represents 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions but will reach 17% by 2050 if unchecked. But shipping has been deliberately excluded from UN climate negotiations and little progress has been made in the last two decades on cutting greenhouse gases from one of the dirtiest forms of transport. At the International Maritime Organisation meeting in March in London, countries are supposed to come up with a new way forward to fulfil the UN agency\u2019s aims of halving shipping emissions by mid-century \u2013 a goal that campaigners say is still inadequate. Last year Extinction Rebellion led effective protests. This year, decisions deferred last year will come back to the agenda. Deforestation In 2010, companies from around the world joined forces on a target to banish deforestation for palm oil from their supply chains permanently by 2020. That target looks far from being met, but at the Consumer Goods Forum in June in London the signatory companies will have to explain their progress and what they hope to do to improve their performance. Palm oil is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation, particularly in south-east Asia where wildlife ranging from the orangutan to the Sumatran elephant and rhino are being endangered. Consumers have the chance to make their views felt: nobody wants their grocery shopping to contribute to species loss, and there are ways to grow natural resources without causing ecological disaster. It is up to producer companies and retailers to make the difference. EU green deal and China EU summit The new European commission took office in Brussels late last year with one central promise: a green deal for Europe, by which the whole of the European economy and EU regulations would be overhauled to put environmental protections at the heart of continued prosperity. Clean energy, transport and industry will create new green jobs to replace those lost in polluting industries, and citizens will enjoy cleaner air, water, a healthier natural environment and a stable climate. That is the goal, at least. Living up to that promise will involve hard choices and skilful diplomacy, and in the course of this year the European commission, member states and EU parliament will face a series of key votes and decisions. The EU will also play a leading role in COP26, and the EU-China summit pegged for mid-September in Leipzig in Germany will be key. With the US rejecting the Paris agreement, cooperation between the world\u2019s other biggest emitters will be vital, so the EU must forge a partnership with China or face failure at COP26.",

Dr Dirk Obbink, associate professor in papyrology and Greek at Christ Church, is the owner of the artefact \u2013 a unique book dating from around 1414. The arts minister, Helen Whateley, has announced a temporary export bar on the precious Myrowr of Recluses, or \u201cMirror of Recluses\u201d, a Middle-English volume of advice addressed to female anchorites and religious hermits. Last summer, Obbink put it up for sale at Bloomsbury Auctions in London where, on 2 July, it was sold to an overseas buyer. The temporary export bar has now been placed on the item because of its outstanding importance for British history and culture.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s weekly Brexit briefing, which, after more than three and a half years and nearly 170 instalments, will be landing in your inbox for the last time on 4 February \u2013 four days after Britain formally leaves the EU. Full live and daily coverage of the key talks on the future relationship between the bloc and its first ex-member will, of course, continue in the Guardian as they advance, while our Brexit Means \u2026 podcast will provide monthly in-depth insights. As Britain gradually disengages from the EU, the Guardian\u2019s European coverage will be developing and deepening. In the meantime, tap into the continental conversation on our Europe Now pages here, and subscribe to our fortnightly Europe newsletter. Top stories A farcical row about whether Big Ben should ring out as the UK leaves the EU dominated the week, with Boris Johnson \u2013 who said government was \u201cworking up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong\u201d \u2013 forced to backtrack. With the cost of halting Westminster restoration work and getting the bells into a ringable state put at \u00a3500,000 and diehard Brexiters howling with indignation, various crowdfunders were set up to raise money, one amassing more than \u00a3227,000. But the government had no plan and could not accept public donations, so now a giant clock will be projected on to No 10 counting down the minutes until 11pm, union flags will fly in Parliament Square and a commemorative coin will be unveiled. In all, the whole sorry saga felt very fitting for Brexit. Rather more significantly, meanwhile, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, sparked business alarm by telling the Financial Times there would be no alignment with EU regulations after transition: There will not be alignment, we will not be a rule taker, we will not be in the single market and we will not be in the customs union \u2013 and we will do this by the end of the year. We\u2019re \u2026 talking about companies that have known since 2016 that we are leaving the EU. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said alignment \u201csupported jobs and competitiveness for many firms, particularly in some of the most deprived regions of the UK\u201d, while the British Chambers of Commerce said continuing uncertainty about the degree of future divergence now \u201crisks firms moving production elsewhere\u201d. With the next phase of talks just weeks away, trust between Brussels and London will not be improved by the Guardian\u2019s revelation that Britain had failed to pass on the details of 75,000 convictions of foreign criminals to their home EU countries, then concealed the scandal for fear of damaging the UK\u2019s reputation in Europe\u2019s capitals. And as the government said an estimated 900,000 EU citizens in the UK had yet to apply for the settled status most will need to remain long-term after Brexit, MEPs said those who had settled status risked discrimination in jobs and housing because the government will not issue physical documents. What next Talks on trade and the future relationship, due to start in early March, are not going to be straightforward. In the latest of the its briefings to member states, the EU made clear that if the UK wanted \u201cto encourage trade and investment\u201d it would have to maintain higher labour and environmental standards than some of the 27. The bloc also said it expects the UK to sign up to Brussels\u2019 state aid rules, and that it would put the \u201csocioeconomic interests\u201d of the bloc\u2019s fishing communities at the centre of its post-Brexit negotiating strategy. The EU would also be granted the possibility of interim measures to react quickly should the UK lower its standards, the European commission said. Its president, Ursula von der Leyen, stressed the difficulty of reaching agreement on the many issues in trade and beyond by the end of 2020: We have to make enormous progress before the summer \u2026 You cannot expect to have a level playing field if there\u2019s a huge divergence in taxation or social standards or environmental standards. So it\u2019s the choice of the UK how far they want to align or diverge. But this is decisive for how good the access to the single market will be or not, in short. You cannot have the cake and eat it at the same time. Best of the rest UK immigration will \u2018put people before passports\u2019, Johnson tells African leaders Unsettled status: EU citizens want card to prove right to stay in UK House of Lords may move out of London to \u2018reconnect\u2019 with public EU\u2019s funding for UK\u2019s poorest areas \u2018must be matched after Brexit\u2019 UK has ruled out automatic deportation of EU citizens, says Verhofstadt UK must get post-Brexit \u2018defence privileges\u2019, says German minister No union jack-lowering ceremony in European parliament Food security plan after Brexit: biggest shake-up to farming in 40 years \u00a330m no-deal Brexit scheme dismantled on roads to Dover French oil firm Total to move financial hub from London to Paris after Brexit Top comment In the Guardian, Fintan O\u2019Toole argues that Brexiters may be lamenting the fact that Big Ben will not ring for Brexit \u2013 but being thwarted is just how they like it: Brexit is inherently anticlimactic. This is because the act of liberation itself is fundamentally spurious. Revolutions unleash euphoria because they create tangible images of change and inaugurate, at least in the fevered minds of their supporters, a new epoch. Brexit can\u2019t do either of these things. The problem with a revolt against imaginary oppression is that you end up with imaginary freedom. How do you actually show that the yoke of Brussels has been lifted? You can\u2019t bring prawn cocktail-flavoured crisps back into the shops, or release stout British fishermen from the humiliation of having to wear hair nets at work on the high seas, or unban donkey rides on beaches, or right any of the other great wrongs that fuelled anti-EU sentiment \u2013 because all of it was make-believe.

      "body": "<p>Like \u201cpolitically correct\u201d before it, the word \u201cwoke\u201d has come to connote the opposite of what it means. Technically, going by the Merriam-Webster dictionary\u2019s definition, woke means \u201caware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice)\u201d, but today we are more likely to see it being used as a stick with which to beat people who aspire to such values, often wielded by those who don\u2019t recognise how un-woke they are, or are proud of the fact.</p> <p>Laurence Fox nailed his colours to the latter mast this weekend, doubling down on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/18/question-time-clash-lecturer-tells-of-hate-mail\" title=\"\">his defence of the privileged white male on last week\u2019s Question Time</a> to a Sunday Times article under the banner \u201cWhy I won\u2019t date \u2018woke\u2019 women\u201d. Toby Young piled in, applauding how Fox was \u201cterrorising the Wokerati\u201d, while the Sun last weekend branded Harry and Meghan \u201cthe oppressive King and Queen of Woke\u201d.</p> <p>For those who would broadly consider themselves woke, the word has been weaponised against them. But the Fox/Young brigade often claim the same.</p> <p>The origins of woke, in this context \u2013 as forged by African American communities \u2013 dates back at least to the 60s, but its mainstream ubiquity is a recent development. Fuelled by black musicians, social media and the #BlackLivesMatter movement, the term entered the Oxford English Dictionary only in 2017, by which time it had become as much a fashionable buzzword as a set of values. Some of those who didn\u2019t keep up with the trend felt left behind: if you didn\u2019t know the meaning of woke, you weren\u2019t.</p> <p>Rather than rejecting the concept of wokeness outright, today\u2019s detractors often claim they are rejecting the word as a signifier of pretentiousness and \u201ccultural elitism\u201d. However, as Fox and others have shown, it is as much to do with the issues of racial and social justice. Criticising \u201cwoke culture\u201d has become a way of claiming victim status for yourself rather than acknowledging that more deserving others hold that status. It has gone from a virtue signal to a dog whistle. The language has been successfully co-opted \u2013 but as long as the underlying injustices remain, new words will emerge to describe them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Like \u201cpolitically correct\u201d before it, the word \u201cwoke\u201d has come to connote the opposite of what it means. Technically, going by the Merriam-Webster dictionary\u2019s definition, woke means \u201caware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice)\u201d, but today we are more likely to see it being used as a stick with which to beat people who aspire to such values, often wielded by those who don\u2019t recognise how un-woke they are, or are proud of the fact. Laurence Fox nailed his colours to the latter mast this weekend, doubling down on his defence of the privileged white male on last week\u2019s Question Time to a Sunday Times article under the banner \u201cWhy I won\u2019t date \u2018woke\u2019 women\u201d. Toby Young piled in, applauding how Fox was \u201cterrorising the Wokerati\u201d, while the Sun last weekend branded Harry and Meghan \u201cthe oppressive King and Queen of Woke\u201d. For those who would broadly consider themselves woke, the word has been weaponised against them. But the Fox/Young brigade often claim the same. The origins of woke, in this context \u2013 as forged by African American communities \u2013 dates back at least to the 60s, but its mainstream ubiquity is a recent development. Fuelled by black musicians, social media and the #BlackLivesMatter movement, the term entered the Oxford English Dictionary only in 2017, by which time it had become as much a fashionable buzzword as a set of values. Some of those who didn\u2019t keep up with the trend felt left behind: if you didn\u2019t know the meaning of woke, you weren\u2019t. Rather than rejecting the concept of wokeness outright, today\u2019s detractors often claim they are rejecting the word as a signifier of pretentiousness and \u201ccultural elitism\u201d. However, as Fox and others have shown, it is as much to do with the issues of racial and social justice. Criticising \u201cwoke culture\u201d has become a way of claiming victim status for yourself rather than acknowledging that more deserving others hold that status. It has gone from a virtue signal to a dog whistle. The language has been successfully co-opted \u2013 but as long as the underlying injustices remain, new words will emerge to describe them.",

Heather Watson\u2019s opening match, against Kyrstina Pliskova, was moved to Wednesday, and Dan Evans will be there also. Although Birmingham\u2019s most popular tennis player still regards the absent Murray as the true British No 1, that badge is Evans\u2019s to carry into the second round against Yoshihito Nishioka.

Both Britons were beaten on merit; both would have expected to win. Konta\u2019s departure was a surprise more than a shock, given she had played just once (and lost) since the US Open more than four months ago, so she leaves Melbourne disappointed but characteristically optimistic that her game would improve in the coming months. She dismissed suggestions that her knee \u2013 which has troubled her since last January \u2013 might need surgery and a long break from the game. She will not reconsider her decision to miss the Fed Cup, a week after this tournament, but will return on the American hardcourt swing in Indian Wells and Miami, and might play one or more of Dubai, Doha, Monterrey or St Petersburg. \u201cHow I physically felt out there is obviously a massive tick for me compared to where I was in September,\u201d she said. Edmund was downbeat but philosophical, a union of the mind made easier in defeat. Asked how he felt about the state of British tennis given another near wipeout in a slam after just one round, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. We as in British? I don\u2019t really know that question. I am sure everyone is trying their best.\u201d Did he think Britain\u2019s supposedly improving tennis battalion should be doing better, though? \u201cMaybe, yes. You could expect better, yes. But I don\u2019t really know. It is hard to answer that because you ask that as if it is a team [event] \u2013 but it is an individual sport, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t have any control over Dan or Jo or Katie or Heather or Cam, so it is hard to answer that isn\u2019t it? \u201cI am sure we are all trying our best, but I can just do my best. I can\u2019t dictate results of other people. People can obviously have hopes and expectations \u2013 that is just natural of everything in life.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 January 2020 to remove text that contravened the Guardian\u2019s editorial guidelines.",

John, a local driver, had picked me up from Granada, 90 minutes\u2019 drive to the north-west, and we were climbing steadily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jan/2020-01-15T12:59:51.html\" data-alt=\"Casa Ana\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jan/2020-01-15T12:59:51.html\">Casa Ana</a> </figure>  <p>I learned that John was part of an informal network of multi-tasking immigrants from the UK and other parts of Europe who now \u2013 among many other types of work \u2013 cater to the likes of me, booked on a two-week writing retreat somewhere in the mountains above. The bare brown hills here are alive not only with walkers, nature- and bird-lovers, but with alternative projects of all kinds.</p> <p>As if in illustration, we saw a couple of hitchhikers, on their way to the still-thriving hippy community in Beneficio. John told me that higher in the hills, a small Tibetan Buddhist retreat provides a haven for meditators, and in the following fortnight I would also hear about a school for doulas, a pet rescue centre, and all kinds of massage, cookery and walking holidays.</p> <p>The Alpujarras mountain ridges and ravines stretch for 45 miles between Almer\u00eda and Granada provinces, between the city and the sea. When temperatures rise towards the mid-30s in Granada \u2013 last year as early as May \u2013 city-dwellers decamp to the hills and mountains to sit out the summer in cooler air. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f26fb95a7d70f6007e45c381b5deda6429f354e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f26fb95a7d70f6007e45c381b5deda6429f354e/0_213_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casa Ana\u2019s terrace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A terrace at Casa Ana: a fertile spot for writing</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This makes the Alpujarras the ideal environment for any kind of retreat or reinvention \u2013 religious, secular or spiritual, individual or collective \u2013 with its inhabitants turning their own practices and passions into businesses, and providing places to stay.</p> <p>Writing courses are everywhere these days, but environments that support writers at work are much harder to find. A few moments after arriving at Casa Ana, in pretty whitewashed Ferreirola, I was sure I was in the right place. Just as in Moroccan and Algerian mountain villages, the plain doors of flat-roofed houses on narrow, empty streets belie the spread of life and colour within: Casa Ana\u2019s door opened to a courtyard of bright flowers, the sound of water and laughter, a shaded terrace and a view of the mountains that stuns newcomers to silence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0e8f8f632c2d93228ed0a28484a7794f7b52e79c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e8f8f632c2d93228ed0a28484a7794f7b52e79c/0_0_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Local area around Casa Ana Water and mountains Puente Palo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nearby countryside</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anne Hunt bought the property as a ramshackle ruin in 2004 and set about bringing it back to life. Having in the past managed an arts charity and a record company \u2013 promoting concerts by Youssou N\u2019Dour and Salif Keita, launching Ali Farka Tour\u00e9\u2019s career and setting up World Circuit Records, which would later record the Buena Vista Social Club \u2013 she immediately saw the house\u2019s potential for hosting creative projects: \u201cFerreirola is a quiet village with about 28 inhabitants, and there are few distractions.\u201d Her aim has been \u201cto inspire, to give time for thinking, relaxing and recharging\u201d. To that end, in addition to writing retreats and courses, she hosts walking holidays with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2010/mar/28/chris-stewart-rain-spain-granada\" title=\"\">Chris Stewart</a>, the author of Driving over Lemons and the original drummer of Genesis, who lives nearby, and transformational life-coaching weekends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8d07be316f2dc9d5185de3d1f84935ae0a88aab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8d07be316f2dc9d5185de3d1f84935ae0a88aab/0_28_3960_2376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast time at Casa Ana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breakfast time at Casa Ana</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hunt has a sure sense of what people need to work creatively. The way the house is designed and run feels simple and natural. Casa Ana has no \u201crules\u201d as such \u2013 there\u2019s no danger of being organised or forced to join in. Writers or walkers come for one- or two-week stints (and can extend their stay on a B&amp;B basis once the retreat or holiday is over).</p> <p>My fellow scribblers last spring were a varied, international bunch. There were poets, novelists and one playwright, beginners as well as established writers, and, unusually, almost as many men as women. Very soon we all felt like old friends, but with no social obligation involved. Because the beauty of this kind of holiday or retreat is being left to get on with it \u2013 with all the security and regularity of routine but diversion not far off when you need it. The terrace is the natural place to congregate at the end of the day, to discuss writing progress \u2013 or, failing that, walking progress \u2013 with reports of hearing stonechats or spotting golden orioles and squirrels with cream bellies and red and black tails.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"656f7276eb14a04560555cc80de7574e321711d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/656f7276eb14a04560555cc80de7574e321711d8/0_131_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A village street in Ferreirola.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A village street in Ferreirola</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Hartley/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the day, the silence is unbroken but for a door closing, someone coughing, the bell for lunch. Occasionally, the tinny tinkle of goats\u2019 bells in the distance, or the guttural roar of the weekly vegetable hawker calling his wares provide welcome interruptions. The en suite rooms, each with desk and chair, are built into the cliff like little eyries from which to stare at the mountain ridge opposite. After a time, my eye began to search crevices and ravines, following little stone slides, pathways, or the wind-bent angles of tiny trees.</p> <p>Breakfast and lunch are provided every day, as well as a few (optional) shared evening meals: delicious combinations of seasonal fresh food in healthy, usually plant-based meals. Practical necessities, which at home might take up half the day, are taken care of: here, there\u2019s no need even to clear plates, let alone wash up or shop for food. Next to the cosy sitting room \u2013 which has armchairs, books and an open fire for the winter, as well as a printer \u2013 is a small kitchen for making tea and coffee, with a fridge that\u2019s magically replenished with bottles of water, snacks and chocolate, as well as wine and beer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f009238912848fce302d9aaf8850f04c9ff1a2b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f009238912848fce302d9aaf8850f04c9ff1a2b6/0_141_3531_2120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A room at Casa Ana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A room at Casa Ana</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the workday was done, I could wander into the hills and disappear into nature, stroll to the local bar or swim in a nearby hotel pool. I could stay home and request an on-site massage or hook up with others for hikes of varying lengths (maps and explanations provided). Concentrated stretches of writing can induce a strange unreality. At first, the stony landscapes and scraggy bushes that sprout bulbous thistles with their enormous purple spike-faces and those rampant, giant cactuses appeared hallucinatory, as if I\u2019d just beamed down into a scene from Star Trek, or perhaps an early Almod\u00f3var film.</p> <p>The great Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca was born and died near here and he drew much of his imagery and poetic force from these hills, saying that \u201call Spanish art is bound to our soil, so full of thistles and definitive stone\u201d. Unusually heavy rainfall last winter and early spring meant wildflowers of every kind had sprouted all over these scrubby, rocky hills. On the smaller roads and paths higher up, little circles of scarlet and purple petals shed by vetch or salvia lay like puddles of confetti, and cascades of white and pink hawthorn blossom, patched with red-berry mistletoe, turned fields into fairylands. The strict rows of trees in almond, olive or citrus groves were softened at the edges by poppies and daisies, or dotted with pink wild orchids and cotton lavender.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b7a4e228b6483c7079227280fd19971d2b9ed72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b7a4e228b6483c7079227280fd19971d2b9ed72/0_120_3834_2300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casa Ana Guest House in Ferreirola in the Alpujarras, Andalucia, Spain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An outdoor area at the house</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Griffiths</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What really sets Casa Ana apart as a writing retreat, though, is that there is help at hand if you are stuck, or writing badly and don\u2019t know why, or just need to discuss your work with someone experienced and impartial.

      "bodyText": "We were looping the southern foothills of the Alpujarras, which in turn form the foothills of the mighty Sierra Nevada, on our way to the little village of Ferreirola, near the town of Pitres. John, a local driver, had picked me up from Granada, 90 minutes\u2019 drive to the north-west, and we were climbing steadily. I learned that John was part of an informal network of multi-tasking immigrants from the UK and other parts of Europe who now \u2013 among many other types of work \u2013 cater to the likes of me, booked on a two-week writing retreat somewhere in the mountains above. The bare brown hills here are alive not only with walkers, nature- and bird-lovers, but with alternative projects of all kinds. As if in illustration, we saw a couple of hitchhikers, on their way to the still-thriving hippy community in Beneficio. John told me that higher in the hills, a small Tibetan Buddhist retreat provides a haven for meditators, and in the following fortnight I would also hear about a school for doulas, a pet rescue centre, and all kinds of massage, cookery and walking holidays. The Alpujarras mountain ridges and ravines stretch for 45 miles between Almer\u00eda and Granada provinces, between the city and the sea. When temperatures rise towards the mid-30s in Granada \u2013 last year as early as May \u2013 city-dwellers decamp to the hills and mountains to sit out the summer in cooler air. This makes the Alpujarras the ideal environment for any kind of retreat or reinvention \u2013 religious, secular or spiritual, individual or collective \u2013 with its inhabitants turning their own practices and passions into businesses, and providing places to stay. Writing courses are everywhere these days, but environments that support writers at work are much harder to find. A few moments after arriving at Casa Ana, in pretty whitewashed Ferreirola, I was sure I was in the right place. Just as in Moroccan and Algerian mountain villages, the plain doors of flat-roofed houses on narrow, empty streets belie the spread of life and colour within: Casa Ana\u2019s door opened to a courtyard of bright flowers, the sound of water and laughter, a shaded terrace and a view of the mountains that stuns newcomers to silence. Anne Hunt bought the property as a ramshackle ruin in 2004 and set about bringing it back to life. Having in the past managed an arts charity and a record company \u2013 promoting concerts by Youssou N\u2019Dour and Salif Keita, launching Ali Farka Tour\u00e9\u2019s career and setting up World Circuit Records, which would later record the Buena Vista Social Club \u2013 she immediately saw the house\u2019s potential for hosting creative projects: \u201cFerreirola is a quiet village with about 28 inhabitants, and there are few distractions.\u201d Her aim has been \u201cto inspire, to give time for thinking, relaxing and recharging\u201d. To that end, in addition to writing retreats and courses, she hosts walking holidays with Chris Stewart, the author of Driving over Lemons and the original drummer of Genesis, who lives nearby, and transformational life-coaching weekends. Hunt has a sure sense of what people need to work creatively. The way the house is designed and run feels simple and natural. Casa Ana has no \u201crules\u201d as such \u2013 there\u2019s no danger of being organised or forced to join in. Writers or walkers come for one- or two-week stints (and can extend their stay on a B&amp;B basis once the retreat or holiday is over). My fellow scribblers last spring were a varied, international bunch. There were poets, novelists and one playwright, beginners as well as established writers, and, unusually, almost as many men as women. Very soon we all felt like old friends, but with no social obligation involved. Because the beauty of this kind of holiday or retreat is being left to get on with it \u2013 with all the security and regularity of routine but diversion not far off when you need it. The terrace is the natural place to congregate at the end of the day, to discuss writing progress \u2013 or, failing that, walking progress \u2013 with reports of hearing stonechats or spotting golden orioles and squirrels with cream bellies and red and black tails. During the day, the silence is unbroken but for a door closing, someone coughing, the bell for lunch. Occasionally, the tinny tinkle of goats\u2019 bells in the distance, or the guttural roar of the weekly vegetable hawker calling his wares provide welcome interruptions. The en suite rooms, each with desk and chair, are built into the cliff like little eyries from which to stare at the mountain ridge opposite. After a time, my eye began to search crevices and ravines, following little stone slides, pathways, or the wind-bent angles of tiny trees. Breakfast and lunch are provided every day, as well as a few (optional) shared evening meals: delicious combinations of seasonal fresh food in healthy, usually plant-based meals. Practical necessities, which at home might take up half the day, are taken care of: here, there\u2019s no need even to clear plates, let alone wash up or shop for food. Next to the cosy sitting room \u2013 which has armchairs, books and an open fire for the winter, as well as a printer \u2013 is a small kitchen for making tea and coffee, with a fridge that\u2019s magically replenished with bottles of water, snacks and chocolate, as well as wine and beer. When the workday was done, I could wander into the hills and disappear into nature, stroll to the local bar or swim in a nearby hotel pool. I could stay home and request an on-site massage or hook up with others for hikes of varying lengths (maps and explanations provided). Concentrated stretches of writing can induce a strange unreality. At first, the stony landscapes and scraggy bushes that sprout bulbous thistles with their enormous purple spike-faces and those rampant, giant cactuses appeared hallucinatory, as if I\u2019d just beamed down into a scene from Star Trek, or perhaps an early Almod\u00f3var film. The great Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca was born and died near here and he drew much of his imagery and poetic force from these hills, saying that \u201call Spanish art is bound to our soil, so full of thistles and definitive stone\u201d. Unusually heavy rainfall last winter and early spring meant wildflowers of every kind had sprouted all over these scrubby, rocky hills. On the smaller roads and paths higher up, little circles of scarlet and purple petals shed by vetch or salvia lay like puddles of confetti, and cascades of white and pink hawthorn blossom, patched with red-berry mistletoe, turned fields into fairylands. The strict rows of trees in almond, olive or citrus groves were softened at the edges by poppies and daisies, or dotted with pink wild orchids and cotton lavender. What really sets Casa Ana apart as a writing retreat, though, is that there is help at hand if you are stuck, or writing badly and don\u2019t know why, or just need to discuss your work with someone experienced and impartial. I\u2019d been going over and over old texts, unable to break any new ground, and by the time I arrived I was fed up and had no idea how to progress. As well as leading (optional) group critiquing sessions a couple of times a week \u2013 where I could hear voices from all genres, receive insight into my work and comment on others\u2019 \u2013 the brilliant resident mentor, poet Mary-Jane Holmes, offers one-to-one sessions. Able to turn her hand to any style or subject, be it fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or even translation, she will read your work closely beforehand in order to talk over ideas and suggest potential solutions, some of which you will no doubt have been mulling.

On an isolated peak overlooking the town, a romantic ruin glowed orange in the setting sun, as if ablaze; in 1500, the Moorish Emir of Lanjar\u00f3n is said to have thrown himself off its ramparts rather than surrender to the Christian army led by King Ferdinand II.

Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/01/khan-attack-will-put-sentencing-and-release-of-terrorists-under-scrutiny\">was out on licence</a> when he murdered two people in Fishmongers\u2019 Hall, in central London before he was shot dead by police. The new measures will include lie-detector tests, a doubling of counter-terrorism specialised probation officers and closer monitoring and reporting requirements including polygraph tests, the Home Office and Ministry of Justice said in a joint announcement. An independent review of the way different agencies including the police, the probation service and the security services investigate, monitor and manage terrorist offenders will also be launched. Critics say the overhaul is too little, too late: \u201cAfter 10 years in government, a major overhaul now is actually an admission of failure,\u201d Diane Abbott says. She said cuts to policing had undermined the fight against terrorism.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trump impeachment </strong>\u2013 The long-awaited trial of the president will kick off today at around 6pm UK time. Late last night the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/mitch-mcconnell-outlines-proposals-for-speedy-impeachment-process\">outlined his proposals</a> for a speedy trial and, he hopes, acquittal, with no guarantees about witnesses or new evidence. Democrats, who demanded votes on witnesses to be held straight away, branded McConnell\u2019s proposals a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d. Senators will debate the rules of the trial when they convene. Trump won\u2019t be there, as he is scheduled to give a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-senate\">key-note address at the Davos World Economic Forum</a> in Switzerland. The Guardian will have comprehensive coverage of the trial, including a live blog, details of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/20/what-are-trump-articles-of-impeachment\">articles of impeachment</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/trump-impeachment-trial-key-senators-mitt-romney-lisa-murkowski-susan-collins\">key senators who could cross the floor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/mitch-mcconnell-impeachment-trial-trump-who-is-senate-leader\">profiles of McConnell</a> and one of Trump\u2019s other key backers in the chamber, Lindsey Graham, who has promised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/lindsey-graham-senator-trump-bulldog-impeachment-trial\">not to \u201cpretend to be a fair juror\u201d.</a></p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Dangerous moment\u2019</strong> \u2013 Conservative MPs have seized on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/20/bbc-faces-dangerous-moment-after-tony-halls-departure\">Tony Hall\u2019s departure as the BBC\u2019s director general in the summer</a> to call for an overhaul of funding and the licence fee. The former culture secretary, John Whittingdale called for a debate on the broadcaster\u2019s funding at its 2022 mid-term review. He wants Hall\u2019s successor to consider how the BBC can compete in the Netflix era. The combination of an unfriendly government and an ageing audience <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/20/tony-hall-gave-bbc-stability-but-failed-to-see-digital-crisis-ahead\">will likely give Hall\u2019s successor sleepless nights</a>.

Action on Sugar at the university found that the pre-mixed drinks sold in supermarkets contain up to nine teaspoons of sugar in just 250ml. \u201cIf consumers knew how much sugar was really in these drinks, would they still happily choose to drink their way to tooth decay, obesity and type 2 diabetes?\u201d asked Katherine Jenner, the group\u2019s campaign director.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Admission of failure\u2019 in fight against terrorism Good morning and welcome to this Tuesday briefing with Alison Rourke. A raft of new measures is being drawn up to monitor convicted terrorists in the community, in the wake of the December\u2019s London Bridge attack. Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist was out on licence when he murdered two people in Fishmongers\u2019 Hall, in central London before he was shot dead by police. The new measures will include lie-detector tests, a doubling of counter-terrorism specialised probation officers and closer monitoring and reporting requirements including polygraph tests, the Home Office and Ministry of Justice said in a joint announcement. An independent review of the way different agencies including the police, the probation service and the security services investigate, monitor and manage terrorist offenders will also be launched. Critics say the overhaul is too little, too late: \u201cAfter 10 years in government, a major overhaul now is actually an admission of failure,\u201d Diane Abbott says. She said cuts to policing had undermined the fight against terrorism. * * * Trump impeachment \u2013 The long-awaited trial of the president will kick off today at around 6pm UK time. Late last night the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, outlined his proposals for a speedy trial and, he hopes, acquittal, with no guarantees about witnesses or new evidence. Democrats, who demanded votes on witnesses to be held straight away, branded McConnell\u2019s proposals a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d. Senators will debate the rules of the trial when they convene. Trump won\u2019t be there, as he is scheduled to give a key-note address at the Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland. The Guardian will have comprehensive coverage of the trial, including a live blog, details of the articles of impeachment, the key senators who could cross the floor, profiles of McConnell and one of Trump\u2019s other key backers in the chamber, Lindsey Graham, who has promised not to \u201cpretend to be a fair juror\u201d. * * * \u2018Dangerous moment\u2019 \u2013 Conservative MPs have seized on Tony Hall\u2019s departure as the BBC\u2019s director general in the summer to call for an overhaul of funding and the licence fee. The former culture secretary, John Whittingdale called for a debate on the broadcaster\u2019s funding at its 2022 mid-term review. He wants Hall\u2019s successor to consider how the BBC can compete in the Netflix era. The combination of an unfriendly government and an ageing audience will likely give Hall\u2019s successor sleepless nights. The mid-term review is likely to be used to discuss both the abolition of the license fee and decriminalisation of non-payment. Since Christmas, the former chair of Ofcom Patricia Hodgson has called for a subscription model to be introduced. * * * \u2018I am not a spy\u2019 \u2013 The British-Australian academic, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who is being held in prison in Iran, claims Tehran tried to recruit her as a spy in exchange for her release. In a letter to her \u201ccase manager\u201d that was smuggled out of prison, the Cambridge-educated academic wrote: \u201cPlease accept this letter as an official and definitive rejection of your offer to me to work with the intelligence branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\u201d She said she could not be persuaded under any circumstances to change her mind. \u201cI am not a spy. I have never been a spy and I have no interest to work for a spying organisation in any country. When I leave Iran, I want to be a free woman and live a free life, not under the shadow of extortion and threats,\u201d the letter said. * * * Sugar tax \u2013 Alcopops have the equivalent of four doughnuts-worth of sugar, according to Queen Mary University experts in London, and should be subject to the sugary drinks tax. Action on Sugar at the university found that the pre-mixed drinks sold in supermarkets contain up to nine teaspoons of sugar in just 250ml. \u201cIf consumers knew how much sugar was really in these drinks, would they still happily choose to drink their way to tooth decay, obesity and type 2 diabetes?\u201d asked Katherine Jenner, the group\u2019s campaign director. Of 154 drinks the group surveyed in stores, just 14 (9%) had information on sugar on the pack and only 63 (41%) had any form of nutritional information. * * * Earth sandwich \u2013 Two men have created a sandwich with 12,724 km of the planet as its filling. New Zealander Etienne Naude, 19, placed his slice of white bread on an Auckland beach, while a Spanish man who responded to Naude\u2019s callout on Reddit, placed his slice on exactly the opposite site of the world. \u201cWe made sure to get the exact location with Google Maps, to get us within a few metres range, and then we used the actual image data on Google Maps to pinpoint ourselves even closer than that,\u201d Naude, a computer science student, said. Bon app\u00e9tit. Today in Focus podcast Today in Focus podcast: The trial of Harvey Weinstein \u2013 Ed Pilkington looks ahead to Weinstein\u2019s court battle where he faces charges of rape and sexual assault, which he denies. And Jamie Grierson on why counter-terror police have listed Extinction Rebellion as a \u201ckey threat\u201d. Lunchtime read: actor Jonathan Pryce on being a \u2018newcomer\u2019 at 72 Jonathan Pryce\u2019s best-actor Oscar nomination has been a long time coming. \u201cBest newcomer,\u201d he says ruefully. \u201cAlthough I already do have a best newcomer award. It was for Breaking Glass. Back in 1980.\u201d His best actor nomination for his role in Netflix drama The Two Popes has won him accolades and his phone has barely stopped buzzing with congratulations, requests and demands on his time. It\u2019s a change for the man who has spent much of his career as the quiet man of British acting; the coiled spring in the works, unobtrusive, precise and usually critical, whether he is playing a Bond villain on screen or Shylock on stage; Cardinal Wolsey in Wolf Hall or the High Sparrow in Game of Thrones. Like Pope Francis, perhaps, he is the connoisseur\u2019s choice, the progressive dark horse, writes Xan Brookes.

A two-thirds majority of members present in the Republican-controlled Senate would be required to remove him.</p> <p>But the Senate trial may hold hidden pitfalls for Trump, including some that could be beyond the power of his sworn allies in the Senate leadership to prevent.</p> <p>To make their case, Democrats will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/20/trump-impeachment-trial-witnesses-senate-democrats-schumer\">seek to call</a> witnesses who might change the way the public perceives Trump\u2019s alleged scheme to wield the unique powers of his office for his own political advantage.</p> <p>But under the McConnell rules, potential witnesses would need to be deposed before testifying at the trial, and individual Senate votes would be required to call the witnesses. It appeared that McConnell had enough votes from his caucus to push the rules package through as soon as the trial convenes on Tuesday afternoon.</p> <p>Republicans have vowed to prevent witnesses from appearing in order to testify, but just a few temporary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jan/10/trump-news-today-live-impeachment-pelosi-iran-democrats-2020-election-latest-updates\">defections</a> from that party line would give Democrats the narrow majority required to force witnesses through or obtain new documents.</p> <p>Presiding at the trial will be John Roberts, chief justice of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/us-supreme-court\">US </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/us-supreme-court\">supreme </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/us-supreme-court\">court</a>, who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/03/trump-impeachment-john-roberts-chief-justice-trial\">expected to rule with a light touch</a> but who will have the power to admit evidence or testimony that Trump might prefer omitted.</p> <p>On the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/20/trump-impeachment-lawyers-brief-senate-trial\">eve</a> of the trial, a dozen lawyers for the president revealed the full scope of their legal strategy, which will follow Trump\u2019s lead in taking a scorched-earth approach to the allegations against him.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Trial-Memorandum-of-President-Donald-J.-Trump.pdf\">110-page legal brief</a> filed with the Senate on Monday, the lawyers called the impeachment \u201can affront to the constitution and to our democratic institutions\u201d and \u201ca brazenly political act by House Democrats that must be rejected\u201d.</p> <p>The document attacked the Democrats\u2019 case on constitutional grounds, arguing that the impeachment was invalid because Trump had not been accused of violating a particular law.</p> <p>But that interpretation of the constitution was unrecognizable to constitutional law experts, many of whom expressed public dismay at what they called the reckless language of the document.</p> <p>\u201cTheir argument is wrong, particularly when they contend that \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors\u2019 requires proof of an indictable crime,\u201d Frank O Bowman III, a professor at the University of Missouri school of law and an impeachment expert, told the Guardian in an email.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cNot true. Never has been, either in England or the US. To argue otherwise, they cherry-pick their sources and ignore the massive body of contrary evidence.\u201d</p> <p>While skipping past most of Trump\u2019s alleged conduct \u2013 all but ignoring the role in the Ukraine scheme of Trump\u2019s main emissary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rudygiuliani\">Rudy Giuliani</a>, and ignoring evidence showing Trump\u2019s role in withholding military aid to Ukraine \u2013 the legal document staked out a narrow band of conduct by Trump and advanced familiar defenses of that conduct.</p> <p>In a July 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trumps-phone-call-with-ukraines-president-read-the-full-transcript\">phone call</a> in which Trump reminded the Ukrainian president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a>, that \u201cthe United States has been very, very good to Ukraine\u201d and then asked for \u201ca favor\u201d, Trump was motivated by a desire to stamp out internal Ukrainian corruption, the document argued.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like Presidential tweets reformatted to look like a legal document,\u201d <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1219321490438381569\">tweeted</a> Orin Kerr, a prominent scholar of constitutional law and law professor at the University of California-Berkeley.</p> <p>One of the most flagrant assertions in the Trump legal brief, according to scholars, was an attack on subpoenas issued by the House during the impeachment proceedings as \u201cdefective\u201d. The White House relied on that reasoning to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/08/trump-impeachment-investigation-letter-constitutional-crisis\">deny</a> witnesses and testimony to the House inquiry, which prompted the obstruction of Congress charge.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the argument of a monarch,\u201d wrote Schiff, \u201cwith no basis in the constitution.\u201d</p> <p>But as he prepared to depart for Switzerland, Trump got well out ahead of his lawyers on Twitter, in a pattern that could repeat itself during the trial, which is expected to last at least two weeks and could run for much longer.</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t want John Bolton and others in the House,\u201d Trump tweeted, referring to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-bolton\">former national security adviser</a>, who could recount direct conversations with the president about Ukraine, in testimony that could be damaging.</p> <p>In fact, the intelligence committee <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/us/politics/john-bolton-ukraine-impeachment.html\">requested</a> in October that Bolton appear to testify, but he declined, threatening the committee with a lawsuit if they attempted to subpoena him.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Mr. President, we did ask John Bolton to testify,\u201d Schiff <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1219304406237241351\">replied</a> on Twitter. \u201cYou ordered him not to, and blocked others, like [acting chief of staff] Mick Mulvaney.</p> <p>\u201cAll Americans know what [sic] a fair trial includes documents and witnesses.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you hiding?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "As Donald Trump prepared on Tuesday to address the billionaires gathered in Davos, the US Senate prepared to hear opening arguments in an impeachment trial that could remove Trump from the presidency, if not from his seemingly unassailable perch in the public eye. For only the third time in history, prosecutors sent by the House of Representatives will rise on the Senate floor to charge the president with \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d and declare that he must be turned out of the White House. Trump \u201cis the framers\u2019 worst nightmare come to life\u201d, Adam Schiff, chair of the intelligence committee and the lead impeachment prosecutor, wrote in a brief filed Monday, referring to the authors of the US constitution. Trump was impeached in a party-line vote on two articles, or charges, in the House last month, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, relating to accusations that he threatened US national security with his conduct towards Ukraine. But as his Senate trial got under way in earnest, Trump received a powerful boost of support from the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who on Monday night unveiled a resolution designed to move the trial forward with unanticipated speed. The schedule laid out by McConnell would consign key proceedings to late, potentially post-midnight hours and left in doubt whether the Senate would admit evidence gathered in the House \u2013 much less call any witnesses to testify about Trump\u2019s conduct. Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, called the resolution \u201ca national disgrace\u201d. It is \u201cclear Senator McConnell is hell-bent on making it much more difficult to get witnesses and documents and intent on rushing the trial through\u201d, Schumer said. Cocooned by the fidelity of a Republican party intolerant of the least criticism of their leader, even as the trial begins Trump appeared to be safe in his post. A two-thirds majority of members present in the Republican-controlled Senate would be required to remove him. But the Senate trial may hold hidden pitfalls for Trump, including some that could be beyond the power of his sworn allies in the Senate leadership to prevent. To make their case, Democrats will seek to call witnesses who might change the way the public perceives Trump\u2019s alleged scheme to wield the unique powers of his office for his own political advantage. But under the McConnell rules, potential witnesses would need to be deposed before testifying at the trial, and individual Senate votes would be required to call the witnesses. It appeared that McConnell had enough votes from his caucus to push the rules package through as soon as the trial convenes on Tuesday afternoon. Republicans have vowed to prevent witnesses from appearing in order to testify, but just a few temporary defections from that party line would give Democrats the narrow majority required to force witnesses through or obtain new documents. Presiding at the trial will be John Roberts, chief justice of the US supreme court, who is expected to rule with a light touch but who will have the power to admit evidence or testimony that Trump might prefer omitted. On the eve of the trial, a dozen lawyers for the president revealed the full scope of their legal strategy, which will follow Trump\u2019s lead in taking a scorched-earth approach to the allegations against him. In a 110-page legal brief filed with the Senate on Monday, the lawyers called the impeachment \u201can affront to the constitution and to our democratic institutions\u201d and \u201ca brazenly political act by House Democrats that must be rejected\u201d. The document attacked the Democrats\u2019 case on constitutional grounds, arguing that the impeachment was invalid because Trump had not been accused of violating a particular law. But that interpretation of the constitution was unrecognizable to constitutional law experts, many of whom expressed public dismay at what they called the reckless language of the document. \u201cTheir argument is wrong, particularly when they contend that \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors\u2019 requires proof of an indictable crime,\u201d Frank O Bowman III, a professor at the University of Missouri school of law and an impeachment expert, told the Guardian in an email. He continued: \u201cNot true. Never has been, either in England or the US. To argue otherwise, they cherry-pick their sources and ignore the massive body of contrary evidence.\u201d While skipping past most of Trump\u2019s alleged conduct \u2013 all but ignoring the role in the Ukraine scheme of Trump\u2019s main emissary, Rudy Giuliani, and ignoring evidence showing Trump\u2019s role in withholding military aid to Ukraine \u2013 the legal document staked out a narrow band of conduct by Trump and advanced familiar defenses of that conduct. In a July 2019 phone call in which Trump reminded the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that \u201cthe United States has been very, very good to Ukraine\u201d and then asked for \u201ca favor\u201d, Trump was motivated by a desire to stamp out internal Ukrainian corruption, the document argued. \u201cIt\u2019s like Presidential tweets reformatted to look like a legal document,\u201d tweeted Orin Kerr, a prominent scholar of constitutional law and law professor at the University of California-Berkeley. One of the most flagrant assertions in the Trump legal brief, according to scholars, was an attack on subpoenas issued by the House during the impeachment proceedings as \u201cdefective\u201d. The White House relied on that reasoning to deny witnesses and testimony to the House inquiry, which prompted the obstruction of Congress charge. \u201cThis is the argument of a monarch,\u201d wrote Schiff, \u201cwith no basis in the constitution.\u201d But as he prepared to depart for Switzerland, Trump got well out ahead of his lawyers on Twitter, in a pattern that could repeat itself during the trial, which is expected to last at least two weeks and could run for much longer. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want John Bolton and others in the House,\u201d Trump tweeted, referring to his former national security adviser, who could recount direct conversations with the president about Ukraine, in testimony that could be damaging. In fact, the intelligence committee requested in October that Bolton appear to testify, but he declined, threatening the committee with a lawsuit if they attempted to subpoena him. \u201cNo, Mr. President, we did ask John Bolton to testify,\u201d Schiff replied on Twitter. \u201cYou ordered him not to, and blocked others, like [acting chief of staff] Mick Mulvaney. \u201cAll Americans know what [sic] a fair trial includes documents and witnesses. \u201cWhat are you hiding?\u201d",

Joe Manchin The moderate West Virginia Democrat has revealed he is \u201cvery much torn\u201d about whether to vote to convict the president \u2013 fuelling the suggestion he could vote against removing Trump from office. Speaking in December he told CNN: \u201cWe have a divided country. On the other hand, we have equal branch of governments, responsibilities in the constitution. There are a lot of things at stake here.\u201d",

As one of the most capable \u2013 and ruthless \u2013 tacticians in the history of the US Senate, McConnell, the political infighter who became legendary for frustrating the agenda of Barack Obama and monkey-wrenching a supreme court nomination, looks like the ideal figure for Trump to have in charge at this most tenuous moment.

Not the tallest player, but strong and compact, gets into his work speedily and hits through his forehand with plenty of zing. He advances to 40-15 with no little help from Nadal, who goes long with a couple of forehands, but the world No 1 fights back to deuce by keeping the ball alive long enough to induce errors. </p> <p>Dellien comes out on top of the next long rally, hitting the outside of the baseline right in Nadal\u2019s forehand corner. The excellence of that winner is quickly undermined by a double fault. </p> <p>Nadal ups the ante to force an early break point but Dellien works hard to defend it. The 19-time grand slam champion forces another soon afterwards though, displaying beautiful movement across the baseline to keep ball after ball in play, driving Dellien to distraction.

The second seed is a tour-leading server, and has been for some time, but slips to deuce after lobbing a second serve right in the slot for her opponent to run around and slam a forehand down the line. </p> <p>Mladenovic ups the ante one point later, slapping a forehand crosscourt for consecutive clean return winners. She fails to convert though, missing her fourth break point of the match. </p> <p>She earns a fifth with some gorgeous court craft, lulling Pliskova into a false sense of security from the back of the court then finessing a drop shot winner. Again though, Pliskova serves her way out of trouble, sending down three booming right-handers to level at 2-2.</p> <p>In the first set Pliskova made just four unforced errors - she\u2019s up to seven already this set.

The headline acts hit the show courts at 11am. </p> <p>Yesterday was as straightforward as an opening day gets for the big names with the likes of Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic progressing in the men\u2019s draw and Ash Barty and Serena Williams in the women\u2019s. Federer and Williams in particular looked their vintage selves despite their advancing years.</p> <p>A few seeds tumbled out but only the departure of 13th-ranked Denis Shapovalov caused anything like a ripple of shock.</p> <p>Today attention turns initially to Rafael Nadal, and the start of his quest to match Federer\u2019s record haul of 20 grand slam titles. Before we get to him Maria Sharapova has a chance to kickstart her stuttering career on Rod Laver Arena, while second seed Karolina Pliskova will have her hands full against Fed Cup hero Kristina Mladenovic.</p> <p>If you want to join in at any point throughout the day, you can reach me by email: <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com</a> or Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft\">@JPHowcroft</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30d9324294b5153db412c38d56eca0b2c3b561b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30d9324294b5153db412c38d56eca0b2c3b561b5/0_117_1848_1109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafael Nadal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafael Nadal is the star attraction on day two of the Australian Open.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Owen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s where our coverage of the afternoon session ends. Rafael Nadal was brilliant in seeing off Hugo Dellien, British No 1 Jo Konta will have lots of time for reflection after losing to Ons Jabeur and one wonders if we\u2019ll see Maria Sharapova at the Australian Open again after she was beaten by Donna Vekic. Be sure to join us tonight for our live coverage of the evening session. Bye for now. Around the courts ... 12th seed Fabio Fognini needed five sets to get past Reilly Opelka. 19th seed Madison Keys was untroubled in seeing off Russian Daria Kasatkina, winning 6-3 6-1. Australia\u2019s Jordan Thompson, the world No 63, was a straight-sets winner over Alexander Bublik. Australia\u2019s Marc Polmans emerged victorious in a five-set epic against Mikhail Kukushkin, winning the first two sets before taking the final set 6-4. Nadal strolls through this third set in barely over half an hour to advance to the second round. Dellien gave it his all - in the first two sets he matched it with the world No 1 at times - but the effort took its toll and the final set was a celebration of all things Nadal. As you would expect from a man who has eyes on the big prize, he got better as the game wore on. As tenacious and brave as Dellien was, Nadal hit more winners, committed fewer unforced errors and was simply the better player. Twenty in 20? Why not? Third set: Nadal 6-2 6-3 5-0 Dellien* (*denotes server): Another unforced error from Dallien, another backhand winner and service break for Nadal, and the world No 1 is now one game away from winning this match in straight sets. He\u2019s been ruthless in this third set. Completely without ruth. Third set: Nadal* 6-2 6-3 4-0 Dellien (*denotes server): Where Dallien is tiring, Nadal is getting stronger. The Spaniard rips another winner - his 11th of the set - to set up game point, finishing the deal with his fourth ace. Not long now. Third set: Nadal 6-2 6-3 3-0 Dellien* (*denotes server): A brutal double-handed backhand winner sets up break point for Nadal. Dellien then finds the net - yet another unforced error - and this, ladies and gentlemen, is where we are at in this match. With two breaks under his belt, Nadal is steaming towards victory. Third set: Nadal* 6-2 6-3 2-0 Dellien (*denotes server): Brilliant from Nadal, who at 0-30 down again gives Dellien a modicum of optimism before closing the game with clinical ease. Shot of the game, of the match, is a sliced cross-court backhand winner that draws applause from everyone in Rod Laver Arena - Dallien included. Meanwhile, back in the land of Maria Sharapova ... Third set: Nadal 6-2 6-3 1-0 Dellien* (*denotes server): Dellien is looking more than a little punch drunk out there. He\u2019s taken some torrid hits at the hands of Nadal. Not literally, of course, but you know what I mean. The thing is, tired, bruised and inevitably deflated, he keeps coming back for more. Nadal holds a 15-40 lead, Dellien withstands the 10-count to take the game to deuce and even sees off five break points, but it\u2019s hard to deliver the killer punch when you\u2019re on the ropes, legs like jelly. Nadal breaks and one wonders how much Dellien has left in the tank. Second set: Nadal* 6-2 6-3 Dellien (*denotes server): Nadal holds to love. Nadal wins the second set. Dellien hides under his chair, in the foetal position, sucking his thumb. Second set: Nadal 6-2 5-3 Dellien* (*denotes server): Oh the pain for Dellien! Nadal breaks back. You can count on one hand (and a finger) how many unforced errors he\u2019s made in this set, but Dellien continues to be best by them. And that tells the tale of this game as Nadal moves to within a held service game of the second set. Second set: Nadal* 6-2 4-3 Dellien (*denotes server): Dellien recovers from that service lapse to hold two break points. He lets one go begging before sending Nadal on a run around the court, forcing an error and breaking back! Well played. Could easily have rolled over and allowed Nadal to go to 5-2. But he didn\u2019t. I\u2019d hate to get into an argument with Dellien. He\u2019d probably be able to convince me climate change isn\u2019t real. Second set: Nadal 6-2 4-2 Dellien* (*denotes server): Dellien hits long to hand a service break to Nadal ... to love. Ouch. That hurts. Thing is, the difference between Nadal\u2019s best and worst is about 10%. Dellien, at his best, rubs shoulders with Nadal. At his worst, he\u2019s rubbing the Spaniard\u2019s bootlaces. Dellien was almost non-existent on serve in this game. A massive drop on his output. And Nadal made him pay. Second set: Nadal* 6-2 3-2 Dellien (*denotes server): Nadal holds his serve to love. Easier than Ernie Els. Second set: Nadal 6-2 2-2 Dellien* (*denotes server): When Dellien goes for his shots, which is always, and they find their desired destination, which isn\u2019t always, boy he looks good. A crunching cross-court forehand winner highlights this game and, on serve, this set is game on. Second set: Nadal* 6-2 2-1 Dellien (*denotes server): Easy is as easy does for Nadal, who holds his serve with ease. Easy. Second set: Nadal 6-2 1-1 Dellien* (*denotes server): Point of the match, unquestionably, goes to Dellien as does the game itself. The Bolivian looks right at home against - as good as, even - the world No 1 during a breathless 21-point rally that ends with Nadal crashing a forehand into the net. Dellien paints the blueprint. Now to follow it. Second set: Nadal* 6-2 1-0 Dellien (*denotes server): New set, same story. Dellien goes after Nadal\u2019s serve but - like a cat with a undersized, overawed and frightened mouse - the world No 1 more or less toys with his opponent to take the opening game of the third set. First set: Nadal 6-2 Dellien* (*denotes server): Nothing so debilitating as hope. Nadal gives Dellien a peek into the promised land by dropping his serve, but shuts the door as quickly as he opened it. Dellien, again, has his chances, but Nadal keeps his composure better, goes easier on the unforced errors, and breaks serve (for the third time this match) to take the first set. Dellien must be wondering what he has to do. Statistically, he\u2019s in the match - his first serve is going at 75% to Nadal\u2019s 54%; he\u2019s won just eight fewer points to this juncture - but Nadal just doesn\u2019t give away easy points. And Dellien does. First set: Nadal* 5-2 Dellien (*denotes server): Toothpicks in hand, Dellien breaks Nadal with what can only be described as a minimum of fuss - the Spaniard wins just one point for the game - and has clawed back one of his service breaks. One gets the impression that no matter the scoreline, Dellien will play his game to the bitter end. This man\u2019s jib, I like the cut of it. First set: Nadal 5-1 Dellien* (*denotes server): Again, it\u2019s not easy but finally, finally, Dellien holds serve and takes a gamer off the world No 1. The scoreline looks bad for the Bolivian, and it is, but he isn\u2019t playing badly. He\u2019s energetic, has initiative, and is brave with his shots. But unless you\u2019re Federer or Djokovic, or intermittently someone else, beating Nadal is like trying to crack a nut with a pair of toothpicks. Around the courts ... Australia\u2019s Jordan Thompson, the world No 63, has taken the first set 6-4 against Alexander Bublik. 2014 Australian Open champ Stan Wawrinka is a set and 4-3 to the good (on serve) over Damir Dzumhur. Australia\u2019s Marc Polmans is two-sets-to-love up against Mikhail Kukushkin - but 4-2 down in the third set. First set: Nadal 4-0 Dellien* (*denotes server): These two are using the full expanses of the court: backhand to forehand to forehand to backhand and any combination in between. Dellien has shown already in this match that he does a good trade in gumption. He holds five game points but can\u2019t capitalise on any of them. Nadal doesn\u2019t give anyone, sucker or otherwise, an even break. Against the world No 1, you need more than gumption. You need to take the take the chances when they arise. Because there won\u2019t be many of them. Nadal breaks again essentially because he made fewer mistakes. That was an epic game counting a total of 18 points. And Dellien still isn\u2019t off the mark. Must be galling for him. First set: Nadal* 3-0 Dellien (*denotes server): Gracias, Jonathan. Dellien shows plenty of ticker, and no small amount of hustle, to take Nadal\u2019s serve to 0-30 but the Spaniard\u2019s court coverage is just ferocious. He attacks the net, cranks a few volleyed winners and looks set to win the game at 40-30 before ... ... Dellien peels off a ridiculous winner down the line to take the game to deuce. The Bolivian keeps up the good work to hold two break points but unforced errors are his undoing. And, as easy as that, what he might look back on as a gilt-edged chance falls by the wayside. Nadal, anything but comfortably, holds serve. But he holds nonetheless. First set: Nadal 2-0 Dellien* (*denotes server): This is my first ever look at Dellien and he\u2019s easy to warm to. Not the tallest player, but strong and compact, gets into his work speedily and hits through his forehand with plenty of zing. He advances to 40-15 with no little help from Nadal, who goes long with a couple of forehands, but the world No 1 fights back to deuce by keeping the ball alive long enough to induce errors. Dellien comes out on top of the next long rally, hitting the outside of the baseline right in Nadal\u2019s forehand corner. The excellence of that winner is quickly undermined by a double fault. Nadal ups the ante to force an early break point but Dellien works hard to defend it. The 19-time grand slam champion forces another soon afterwards though, displaying beautiful movement across the baseline to keep ball after ball in play, driving Dellien to distraction. He repeats the trick to secure the break, hammering an emphatic forehand winner. Rafa is rolling. Right, time for me to handover to Scott Heinrich. First set: Nadal* 1-0 Dellien (*denotes server): Nadal holds to 30 but he doesn\u2019t land many first serves. Across the net Dellien isn\u2019t afraid to step in and give it some welly but aside from one vicious second serve return he struggles to hold his own in the rallies Nadal lives for. Plenty of interest in Nadal\u2019s conditioning after he looked fatigued during the ATP Cup. Remember, his 2019 season only ended a few weeks ago after leading Spain to glory in the Davis Cup Finals. Nadal, by the way, is a picture in hot pink, his massive guns glistening in the sun as per usual for the Australian Open. Rafael Nadal is out on Rod Laver Arena. And so is his 26-year-old opponent, Hugo Dellien from Bolivia. Dellien is ranked 73 in the world and on an upward curve over the past 18-months, but he has never been on a stage like this before, and never come up against an opponent like Rafa. Next up on Rod Laver Arena, Rafael Nadal. This is not a good grand slam for Great Britain. As my colleague Tumaini Carayol points out, \u201cSharapova is now down to 366 in the rankings, which is not very good.\u201d Second set: Vekic* 6-3 6-4 Sharapova (*denotes server): Vekic double faults to open the game and she should be 0-30 behind but Sharapova overhits after dominating the point. Superb defence from the 19th seed, really scrambling desperately to remain alive. It\u2019s a crucial juncture because a couple of good first serves soon hand the Croatian two match points. The first is saved with a highlights reel forehand winner down the line but the second attempted to line drive is wide and Vekic prevails! That was a topsy-turvy contest, and one that Sharapova will rue, especially the way she relinquished the initiative in the second set after scrapping so hard to get back into the match. The Russian remains a wildcard-earning sponsor-pleasing drawcard, but her on-court performances are starting to beg the question: for how long? Second set: Vekic 6-3 5-4 Sharapova* (*denotes server): Sharapova steadies her nerves with a couple of cheap points but at 30-0 she has some issues with her ball toss and when she finally gets her serve away Vekic is waiting to pound a huge clean forehand winner. Another solid return sets up a second point in a row and the pressure tells - Sharapova double faulting for the fifth time in the match. And Vekic wins her fourth game in a row, breaking the Sharapova serve again when the Russian fluffs a backhand into the net. Vekic will serve for the match. Second set: Vekic* 6-3 4-4 Sharapova (*denotes server): Sharapova\u2019s forehand woes start to come back to haunt her but a searing return down the line keeps her alive at 40-30. Vekic then defends brilliantly at full stretch to keep the ball in play, avoid deuce, and consolidate her break. Pressure right back on the Russian now. Good news for Australia! Millman one win away from a possible date with Roger Federer. Benoit Paire (21), also in that ridiculous eighth of the draw with Tsitsipas, Bautista Agut, Cilic and Raonic. He takes on Cilic next. Second set: Vekic 6-3 3-4 Sharapova* (*denotes server): Out of nowhere Sharapova looks tight on serve and double faults on her way to 30-all. Vekic then comes out on top in a reflex volley exchange at the net after failing to nail a drop shot. The 19th seed takes full advantage of her good fortune, drilling a second serve return right on the baseline to force the break back. An unexpected twist in this second set. You need to get used to the dialect, but Brad Gilbert is a good value grand slam follow. Second set: Vekic* 6-3 2-4 Sharapova (*denotes server): How Vekic must wish grand slams allowed coaching. She has yet to figure out Sharapova\u2019s forehand is back on song and serving to it is no longer the smart option. Still, she escapes with a hold despite looking second best. Second set: Vekic 6-3 1-4 Sharapova* (*denotes server): Maria Sharapova is absolutely flying now. After a slow start to the opening set she has dominated this contest. The 19th seed has to figure out a response, and fast. Woah! That is one heck of a comeback from Fabio Fognini. The 12th seed was down and out overnight but he has regrouped to squeak past big-serving Reilly Opelka. The Italian very grateful for the Melbourne rain. Madison Keys (10) is in excellent form, and that result is a lot more comprehensive than I might have expected it to be. Second set: Vekic* 6-3 1-3 Sharapova (*denotes server): That momentum swing finally tells on the scoreboard for Sharapova! 0-40 arrives in quicktime with Vekic targeting her opponent\u2019s forehand but Sharapova has tightened up her game and is no longer a liability on that flank. Vekic claws a point back but at 15-40 double faults to hand the initiative to the former champion. That feels like a decisive moment in this contest - if Sharapova has the legs to run the match out. The young Pole is on course to meet Roger Federer in round three. Second set: Vekic 6-3 1-2 Sharapova* (*denotes server): Another easy hold to love for Sharapova. Vekic has her hands full now. Second set: Vekic* 6-3 1-1 Sharapova (*denotes server): Late in that first set the momentum definitely swung Sharapova\u2019s way and Vekic\u2019s latest service game continues the trend of points being played on her opponent\u2019s racket. Sharapova earns 0-30 with some purposeful tennis but a low-percentage forehand opens the door for the 19th seed and she backs that up with a strong first serve to claw her way back to 30-30. But here Sharapova executes a flowing forehand return winner that has balletic lines under the bright sunshine on RLA. Vekic is a fighter though and nails a couple of first serves to save break point and move up in the game before seeing off the threat with a forehand winner off the net tape following a long grunt-filled rally. Second set: Vekic 6-3 0-1 Sharapova* (*denotes server): Excellent hold to love from Sharapova to start the second set. She\u2019s not far off the mark today despite obvious rustiness, especially with those forehand errors. A big service game coming up for Vekic. First set: Vekic* 6-3 Sharapova (*denotes server): Is this match swinging Sharapova\u2019s way? A very fortunate net cord lands favourably to secure the first point of the game. But then consecutive unforced errors on the forehand side (her 10th and 11th of the match) gift the initiative back to Vekic. An assertive point from the Russian puts her opponent under pressure at 30-30 and Vekic cracks, allowing an easy second serve to be thumped back at her with interest. But with the crucial break at her mercy Sharapova dumps yet another forehand into the net. Guess what? Another Sharapova forehand error at deuce hands Vekic set point - and the Croatian finally accepts the invitation - nailing her first serve that her opponent can only deflect way over the baseline. First set: Vekic 5-3 Sharapova* (*denotes server): A few errors creeping into Vekic\u2019s game now, coinciding with Sharapova finding some rhythm and not overplaying, just keeping the ball in court. Sharapova wins her best point of the match at 30-15, controlling from the baseline then advancing and putting away a tough volley on her shoelaces. Can Vekic take her second chance at serving out the set? First set: Vekic* 5-2 Sharapova (*denotes server): Vekic can\u2019t serve out and Sharapova gets a break back. First set: Vekic 5-1 Sharapova* (*denotes server): Vekic\u2019s power is pushing Sharapova deep during their baseline exchanges and the 19th seed exploits that advantage with a canny drop shot to move up 0-15. Sharapova double faults to invite pressure on her serve but she responds, forcing Vekic wide and controlling a couple of points from the centre of the court. The same pattern repeats at 30-30 but the veteran misses an easy forehand winner to concede a break point. And another unforced error - Sharapova\u2019s tenth (to Vekic\u2019s three) - gifts a second break of the set. First set: Vekic* 4-1 Sharapova (*denotes server): Sharapova wins the opening point but Vekic responds with consecutive aces and eases to 40-15 by getting in quickly behind her serve and hitting behind her wrong-footed opponent. Sharapova digs in but at 40-30 she can\u2019t find the baseline with her return. First set: Vekic 3-1 Sharapova* (*denotes server): Superb start to the game from Vekic, defending and moving smartly across the baseline, advancing to 0-30 with a terrific point. That quickly becomes 0-40 with a Sharapova error and the break follows soon after with the Russian quickly looking off the pace and lacking match sharpness. Vekic, by contrast, is buzzing. First set: Vekic* 2-1 Sharapova (*denotes server): Still no threat to either serve. Vekic looks on her game today, hitting some skimming forehands so flat they are a nightmare to send back over the net. First set: Vekic 1-1 Sharapova* (*denotes server): Easy hold for Sharapova, dispelling concerns over her fitness, especially her serving arm which has been the subject of a number of injuries recently. 23-year-old Vekic in enjoying the form of her life. The Croatian reached two WTA finals in 2019, and progressed to the US Open quarter-finals. First set: Vekic* 1-0 Sharapova (*denotes server): Vekic holds the opening service game comfortably. The Sharapova factor obviously gives this match a high profile, but it remains to be seen where the 32-year-old\u2019s game is at. The Russian has five grand slam trophies in her cabinet but she has only reached two slam quarter-finals since the beginning of 2016 as suspension and injury have wreaked havoc with her career. Ok, time to focus our attention on the next contest on Rod Laver Arena, the court now bathed in sunshine, between 19th seed Donna Vekic and wildcard Maria Sharapova. The 32nd seed is also in that ridiculous eighth of the draw featuring Tsitsipas, Cilic and Bautista Agut. A quick whip around the courts... Belinda Bencic (6) is leading Anna Karolina Schmiedlova by a set but it\u2019s currently 5-5 in a rollercoaster second set over on MCA. Fabio Fognini (12) started the day two sets down to Reilly Opelka but the Italian has won the first set of the day on 1573 Arena to remain in the tournament. Roberto Bautista Agut (9) is on the brink of victory against Davis Cup and ATP Cup teammate Feliciano Lopez over on court 13. While on court 15, Dusan Lajovic (24) took the opening set against 2018 semi-finalist Kyle Edmund. Some rare good news for Australian fans: Second set: Pliskova* 6-1 7-5 Mladenovic (*denotes server): Plsikova doesn\u2019t look confident serving from the glare end either and stumbles to 0-30. She picks up her game quickly though, levelling at 30-30 then forcing an error to enjoy her first match point - which Mladenovic gifts her with an overhit return. That was a tough workout in the second set after racing through the opener. The second seed is probably grateful of being pushed, preparing her for higher-pressure challenges to come. Tough on Mladenovic who played well enough to beat plenty of other players in the draw. Marin Cilic reached the final here just two years ago but after a shocking 2019 finds himself unseeded. He remains a dangerous floater in the section of the draw featuring Roberto Bautista Agut and Stefanos Tsitsipas. Second set: Pliskova 6-1 6-5 Mladenovic* (*denotes server): Back serving from the danger end Mladenovic lacks the same rhythm as recent games and she slides to 15-40. At this point she fluffs her lines, double faulting tamely to hand Pliskova a vital break. The No 2 seed will serve for the match. Second set: Pliskova* 6-1 5-5 Mladenovic (*denotes server): Pliskova gallops to a hold to love. Serving clearly much easier from the side nearest the TV cameras in RLA at present. In case you weren\u2019t aware, Pliskova has a new coaching team this season after splitting from Conchita Martinez. Former WTA player Olga Savchuk and stalwart of the men\u2019s coaching circuit Dani Vallverdu are now in her box. There\u2019s long been a suspicion Pliskova has had the talent but not the mentality to win the biggest prizes and she\u2019s been through a number of coaches in her career in a bid to find that missing piece of the puzzle. Second set: Pliskova 6-1 4-5 Mladenovic* (*denotes server): Mladenovic once again races to 40-0 but then drops a point with a very edgy double fault. She pushes it out of her mind quickly though, securing the game with a forehand winner. Pliskova now serving to stay in the set. Second set: Pliskova* 6-1 4-4 Mladenovic (*denotes server): There is one end at RLA (I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t be more specific about which) where the ball toss is directly into the sun, increasing the degree of difficulty. Mladenovic struggled with it in her previous service game, and Pliskova is ill at ease here, slipping to 30-40 and offering Mladenovic her seventh break point of the match. And finally she takes one! Pliskova dumping the ball into the net after Mladenovic kept the ball on her toes from the baseline. This one is not over just yet. Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report from Jo Konta\u2019s first round defeat. Second set: Pliskova 6-1 4-3 Mladenovic* (*denotes server): Mladenovic races to 40-0 but nerves seem to creep in and suddenly it\u2019s deuce. The Frenchwoman needs a big point - and that\u2019s exactly what she gets, roaring an Allez after dominating behind her second serve. She follows that up with a double fault though, then concedes a break point that Pliskova swarms all over, suffocating Mladenovic until she forces the error. Crucial break of serve, and what feels like a decisive moment in this contest. Second set: Pliskova* 6-1 3-3 Mladenovic (*denotes server): Pliskova holds to love in the time it took me post a tweet and confirm who Sinner faces in the second round. Shame to see Max Purcell bow out so early, but Jannik Sinner is a kid going places. The Next Gen Finals champ has M\u00e1rton Fucsovics next. Second set: Pliskova 6-1 2-3 Mladenovic* (*denotes server): A curious hold from Mladenovic. At 30-30 she seems confused, following up a 110 kph nothing serve with a 180 kph howitzer. Pliskova can\u2019t fathom how she\u2019s behind on the scoreboard after controlling a series of rallies, but she forces deuce with a running forehand down the line. She can\u2019t capitalise though and Mladenovic holds after a long gritty game. The set now seems to depend on Mladenovic\u2019s second serve. Occasionally she is lobbing down some very tame efforts that are inviting trouble. Pliskova is currently a fraction off her range but if/when she settles back into her groove there are some easy second serve returns on offer. Second set: Pliskova* 6-1 2-2 Mladenovic (*denotes server): Mladenovic is grinding her way into this contest after a slow start, chasing every ball and forcing Pliskova to hit winners. The second seed is a tour-leading server, and has been for some time, but slips to deuce after lobbing a second serve right in the slot for her opponent to run around and slam a forehand down the line. Mladenovic ups the ante one point later, slapping a forehand crosscourt for consecutive clean return winners. She fails to convert though, missing her fourth break point of the match. She earns a fifth with some gorgeous court craft, lulling Pliskova into a false sense of security from the back of the court then finessing a drop shot winner. Again though, Pliskova serves her way out of trouble, sending down three booming right-handers to level at 2-2. In the first set Pliskova made just four unforced errors - she\u2019s up to seven already this set. We have a match on our hands. Over to Rod Laver Arena now for some close attention on second seed, and genuine title contender, Karolina Pliskova. The Czech scorched the first set 6-1 against Kristina Mladenovic, the star of France\u2019s recent Fed Cup triumph. The Frenchwoman won all three matches against Australia, including victory over Ash Barty. We\u2019re on serve at 1-1 in the second set. The biggest seeded casualty of the opening round of the Australian Open so far is 12th seeded Johanna Konta. For nine games it was pretty even but from the moment Jabeur broke Konta to take the opening set the momentum was all with the Tunisian, and by the end it was a straightforward upset. Konta looked to be playing within herself - injury perhaps? - I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find out more with Kevin Mitchell soon enough. Next up for the promising 19-year-old Yastremska - Caroline Wozniacki. Johanna Konta (12) holds to love to snap Ons Jabeur\u2019s four-game streak, but the Tunisian hits back with a comfortable hold of her own. Konta is now serving to stay in the championship 2-5 down in the second set. Jabeur holds for 4-1. Time running out for Konta (12). This is going off script fast for Jo Konta (12)! Three games in a row for Ons Jabeur, including two breaks. Jabeur is all over Konta\u2019s serve at the moment. The Sydney-born Great Briton is floating her serves conservatively and Jabeur is making her pay. The outsider a set and 3-1 up. Meanwhile, over on RLA Karolina Pliskova (2) is a break up early on Kristina Mladenovic, while Belinda Bencic (6) is cruising through the opening set against Anna Karolina Schmiedlova on Margaret Court Arena. Fazed? Not Ons Jabeur. She breaks back immediately, showcasing her trademark variety, including a game-winning drop-shot from the baseline that checks like a Tiger Woods pitching wedge. She follows that up by holding to love for a 2-1 second set advantage. Jo Konta has some thinking to do to figure out a strategy to force her way beyond the world No 85. These two have met twice before, sharing a win apiece, although Jabeur took out their most recent meeting in Eastbourne last year. Chastened by losing the opening set, Konta has come out all guns blazing in the second, breaking Jabeur in quicktime. She\u2019s moving well despite some fitness concerns, and looking especially dangerous mixing things up and coming into the net. The first break of the match comes at the worst possible moment for Jo Konta. The 12th seed is now one set down on Ons Jabeur who stepped up a level at 30-30, monstering a Konta second serve then hammering a forehand down the line. This is interesting. Anyone who saw Serena yesterday knew she served superbly, but a rating of 96 for Sam Querrey! Poor Borna Coric (25) on the other side of the net. Jabeur holds for 5-4, despite Konta forcing a break point and a couple of deuces. For people who care about this kind of thing it\u2019s an old-school European tennis apparel clash with Konta (Ellesse) up against Jabeur (Lotto). Very late 80s football casual areas. Still on serve at 4-4 between Konta and Jabeur. The Briton is striking cleanly from the back of the court while her Tunisian opponent is offering more variety, looking to unsettle Konta\u2019s rhythm. 1573 Arena, in case you wondered, is not the 1573rd court on the precinct. It\u2019s the old show court 2 - the fourth-biggest venue, and largest without a roof. It\u2019s named after a Chinese booze company. For our UK audience who may still be up hoping for some news on Jo Konta (12), she was one of the 10.30am starters and is currently 3-3 against Ons Jabeur on 1573 Arena. Miss any of the action yesterday? We\u2019ve got you covered. The headline news is it\u2019s dry and forecast to remain dry all day. However, it will be cool, with temperatures in the 17-21C range kept in check by a southerly breeze. There will be more cloud than bright sunshine for the majority of the action. The air quality forecast is good to moderate. Second up on Melbourne Arena is the in-form Madison Keys (10) against the dangerous Daria Kastakina. After them comes Stan Wawrinka (15) before a match-up that promises plenty of entertainment with crowd favourite Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (28) taking on Australian Alexei Popyrin. Lots to enjoy on 1573 Arena (show court 2) with Jo Konta (12) in action early, followed by the resumption of Fabio Fognini\u2019s first round match - the 12th seed is two sets to love down to the giant Reilly Opelka. Then we have our first look at teenage phenom Felix Auger-Aliasime (20) before perennial contender Elina Svitolina (5) has a hit-out. In a quirk of scheduling Svitolina\u2019s match precedes that of her partner Gael Monfils (10). The tigerish Aryna Sabalenka (11) rounds off a bumper line-up. Aussies John Millman and Jordan Thompson are in the first two matches on court 3, while court 7 is where you need to be for the conclusion of Max Purcell\u2019s grand slam debut (he\u2019s two sets to love down overnight), as well as Marc Polmans, Alex Bolt, and Priscilla Hon. Three more Australians in action on court 8 with James Duckworth, Arina Rodionova, and Astra Sharma taking the court. There\u2019s plenty more besides and we\u2019ll bring you all the breaking news as it arrives throughout the day. Rod Laver Arena: Up first we have possibly the battle of the round with big-serving second seed Karolina Pliskova taking on the dangerous Kristina Mladenovic. After that, wildcard Maria Sharapova will be up against it when she takes on 19th seed Donna Vekic. By mid-afternoon it will be time for world number one Rafael Nadal to strut his stuff against Bolivian outsider Hugo Dellien. Margaret Court Arena: Not a show-stopping line-up on MCA with sixth seed Belinda Bencic leading off, followed by fifth seed Dominic Thiem. Ajla Tomljanovic will then hope to improve on Australia\u2019s poor showing yesterday but she will start as underdog against the wily 31st seed Anastasija Sevastova. Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of day two of the year\u2019s first grand slam. We\u2019ll be around here to cover the day session at Melbourne Park before handing over to a separate liveblog for all the action under lights. After yesterday\u2019s rain we\u2019re in for an action-packed session with play getting underway on the outside courts at 10.30am to begin the process of making up lost time. The headline acts hit the show courts at 11am. Yesterday was as straightforward as an opening day gets for the big names with the likes of Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic progressing in the men\u2019s draw and Ash Barty and Serena Williams in the women\u2019s. Federer and Williams in particular looked their vintage selves despite their advancing years. A few seeds tumbled out but only the departure of 13th-ranked Denis Shapovalov caused anything like a ripple of shock. Today attention turns initially to Rafael Nadal, and the start of his quest to match Federer\u2019s record haul of 20 grand slam titles. Before we get to him Maria Sharapova has a chance to kickstart her stuttering career on Rod Laver Arena, while second seed Karolina Pliskova will have her hands full against Fed Cup hero Kristina Mladenovic.

      "bodyText": "Crown Resorts\u2019 failure to alert authorities about a sale of shares to the Macau-based Melco International before the deal was announced publicly could be a breach of its casino licence and raises questions about Crown\u2019s suitability as a casino operator, the counsel assisting a New South Wales inquiry into the casino giant, Adam Bell SC, has said. The inquiry, which began on Tuesday, is expected to call the billionaire businessman James Packer and the Melco International chairman, Lawrence Ho. It is also expected to hear from a raft of Crown and Melco executives as it seeks to probe whether both Crown and Melco are suitable to exercise control over the high-roller casino licence at Barangaroo in Sydney granted in 2014. The inquiry was sparked by last year\u2019s announcement that Melco plans to buy 19.9% of Crown from Packer\u2019s CPH Holdings and by allegations of money laundering and the involvement of organised crime in Crown\u2019s Melbourne casino made in the Nine newspapers. The former supreme court judge Patricia Bergin SC held an opening hearing on Tuesday, but the inquiry gets under way in earnest on 24 February, when it will begin the first part of its investigation. This will look into the vulnerability of casinos to money laundering and the role of junkets and links to organised crime. A second tranche of hearings is scheduled for March and will look into the sale agreement with Melco and whether the transfer of shares would give rise to any breach of the licence. A third set of hearings will look into allegations made in the Nine publications about Crown\u2019s involvement with money laundering and organised crime, while two final blocks of the inquiry will look at Melco and the suitability of any close associates, and strengthening future regulation. In his opening remarks, Bell said Crown had not alerted the casino authority about the CPH-Melco deal ahead of time in order to allow it to assess the suitability of the new shareholder. This had opened up a question about Crown\u2019s suitability. Crown has said it was not aware of the share sale by its largest shareholder, CPH Holdings, to Melco until the sale was announced publicly. This is despite CPH having four directors on the Crown board. The NSW Casino Control Act requires a licence holder to alert state authorities ahead of time if a new person proposes to become a \u201cclose associate\u201d of the holder of the licence so that authorities can assess whether they are of good repute and do not have any business associations that would raise issues. Bell argued that the NSW act required commissioner Bergin to take a very wide view of who were close associates and that it was not limited to shareholding or directorships but also financial power and influence over a casino\u2019s operation. Lawrence Ho\u2019s Melco group raises particular questions because of his father, Stanley Ho, whose STDM group had a monopoly over gaming in Macau until 2000. Stanley Ho has been linked by casino regulators in New Jersey to triads and organised crime, Bell said. When the Barangaroo licence was granted, the concerns led to special conditions being included in Crown\u2019s licence that prohibited Stanley Ho and 59 companies associated with him from being \u201cclose associates\u201d of the Sydney casino. Lawrence Ho, who had previously been in a joint venture with Crown in Macau, had been cleared in earlier inquiries as a suitable person. But both Bell and his fellow counsel assisting, Naomi Sharp SC, outlined the limits of those investigations, and flagged that there would be a much more detailed investigation of the links between Melco group and the business interests of the father. In particular the inquiry is likely to delve into a company, Great Respect, a British Virgin Islands company that is owned by the family trust in which Stanley Ho is a beneficiary. Great Respect holds 20% of Melco International. Bell noted that despite findings by other casino regulators that Stanley Ho was not suitable, Ho senior has strongly disputed the findings and has not been convicted of any offence. He also noted that Lawrence Ho has said Melco is independent of his father\u2019s gaming interests. Two earlier NSW inquiries that occurred when Crown briefly owned shares in Echo Entertainment, which in turn owned the rival Star casino, had not found any issues of suitability, integrity and honesty in relation to Lawrence Ho, Sharp said Those findings fed into the 2014 inquiry into Crown\u2019s application for a high-roller restricted gaming licence at Barangaroo. \u201cBecause NSW authorities had already looked into suitability in the 2012-13 review, the conduct of the suitability review in 2014 was completed in a short timeframe,\u201d she said. Crown has also faced scrutiny from Victorian authorities. The most recent review in 2018 found that Crown was suitable, Sharp said. But by that time Melco and Crown had ended the joint venture and so the suitability of Lawrence Ho and Melco was not the subject of the review, she said. Sharp also foreshadowed that the inquiry would go into great detail about the role of junkets in Australian casinos and overseas. She noted that junkets are well recognised entities in the gambling landscape and assist casino businesses by bringing VIP and VVIP gamblers to casinos. But junkets also play an important role in providing credit and enforcing gambling debts, and it is these roles that open up vulnerabilities to organised crime, she said. The third part of the inquiry will look into the allegations made by the Nine newspapers and 60 Minutes in July 2019. This will include that Crown resorts knowingly broke the law in China by requiring and incentivising staff to operate in China to lure Chinese high rollers to gamble in Crown\u2019s casinos; that Crown partnered with two junket operators with organised crime backgrounds, including one known as the Company; and that Crown Resorts helped bring criminals through Australian borders that raised serious security concerns. Sharp noted that Crown had denied the allegations and took out an advertisement claiming that the media reporting was based on unsubstantiated claims and falsehoods. On junkets, Crown claimed it dealt with these independent operators in the same way as other companies do around the world. Sharp said the inquiry would hear detailed evidence on how Australia regulates junkets as well as how they are regulated overseas. She revealed that in 2015 and 2018 there were two reviews in NSW conducted by a former Victorian official, Peter Cohen, which had led to NSW\u2019s regulation of junkets being watered down through changes to the regulations in December 2018. She said this Casino Modernisation Review, as it was called, had led to responsibility for scrutiny of junkets being moved from the NSW casino regulators to the licensees in what was said to be a \u201crisk-based approach\u201d. This meant that the casinos themselves were responsible for vetting and approving junket operators to ensure they were not linked to organised crime. The final part of the inquiry will look at the adequacy of regulation. Changes to the regulatory arrangements had stripped the Casino Control Authority of its autonomy and had brought it under the direction of the minister, Sharp said. Recent changes meant the regulator could not make changes to the restricted gaming licence held by Crown without its agreement, she said. Bergin concluded the inquiry by asking the parties to cooperate. She said the inquiry had already assembled 58,000 documents and was in ongoing consultation with state and federal regulators which were providing information. \u201cIf it be the case that the present structures and arrangements in place do not facilitate and enable effective control of the risks of casinos, then you will expect a robust and cutting-edge approach will need to be adopted to control those risks,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>It is the day after the Oscar nominations, and Jonathan Pryce is perched at a corner table in a humdrum London bar, guest of honour at the saddest celebration in town. His first best-actor nomination has been a long time coming. At the age of 72, he has arrived. \u201cBest newcomer,\u201d he says ruefully. \u201cAlthough I already do have a best newcomer award. It was for Breaking Glass. Back in 1980.\u201d</p> <p>It is no surprise to see Pryce honoured for his lovely performance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/01/the-two-popes-review-anthony-hopkins-jonathan-pryce-netflix\" title=\"\">The Two Popes</a>, a likable Netflix drama that spotlights the bromance between Benedict and Francis, but it knocked him sideways all the same. He had not thought he stood a chance; he had just come out of the shower when the news came through. Since then, his phone has barely stopped buzzing. Congratulations and requests. Demands on his time. \u201cBut it\u2019s great,\u201d he adds quickly, and almost sounds as if he means it.</p> <p>Whether by accident or design, Pryce has spent much of his career as the quiet man of British acting; the coiled spring in the works, unobtrusive, precise and usually critical, whether he is playing a Bond villain on screen or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/22/the-merchant-of-venice-review-lincoln-center-new-york\" title=\"\">Shylock on stage</a>; Cardinal Wolsey in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/25/wolf-hall-mark-rylance-hilary-mantel-box-set\" title=\"\">Wolf Hall</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/may/25/game-of-thrones-recap-season-five-episode-seven-the-gift\" title=\"\">High Sparrow</a> in Game of Thrones. Like Pope Francis, perhaps, he is the connoisseur\u2019s choice, the progressive dark horse. Still, you should never make the mistake of confusing an actor with the characters they play.</p> <p>His latest appearance, in Terry Gilliam\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/18/the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-review-cannes-2018-terry-gilliam\" title=\"\">The Man Who Killed Don Quixote</a>, brings him full circle. It was Gilliam who provided Pryce with his breakthrough role in 1985\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/brazil-gilliam-fantasy\" title=\"\">Brazil</a>, and the two have remained firm friends ever since.

Because if I\u2019m not very good as Don Quixote, you can blame it on the shoemaker, who\u2019s not a very good actor. But also Quixote\u2019s playing a role himself, the noble knight. So it\u2019s all role play and the masks are always slipping.\u201d</p> <p>Pryce was offered a slot in Gilliam\u2019s first, ill-fated, stab at the film in 2000, but turned it down because he thought the script was weak. Since then, the role of Quixote has bounced from Jean Rochefort to John Hurt to Michael Palin before landing in Pryce\u2019s lap. Gilliam now suspects this was preordained. \u201cJonathan has basically been waiting to play this part ever since our first collapse,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The director has said some other things, too. Earlier this month, Gilliam told the journalist Alexandra Pollard that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/terry-gilliam-interview-harvey-weinstein-victims-metoo-race-a9269136.html\" title=\"\">#MeToo was a witch-hunt</a>. He said that women in Hollywood should take more responsibility for themselves and that he was \u201ctired of white men being blamed for everything\u201d. But that\u2019s Terry, Pryce says. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a provocateur. That\u2019s what he thrives on: being outrageous, going to extremes.\u201d Besides, he adds, the whole #MeToo issue remains so fresh and raw; people are still working out how to discuss it. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say he was misunderstood or misconstrued,\u201d he adds. \u201cI think it was very clear what he was saying.\u201d</p> <p>Until now, I have filed Gilliam and Pryce as odd-couple collaborators: the disreputable old goat and his cerebral, soft-spoken alter ego. Pryce nods. \u201cThe straight man and the clown. Except that, in this case, the clown is playing the role of straight man. Meanwhile, I\u2019m stuck on the horse, playing the clown.\u201d</p> <p>In contrast to Gilliam, Pryce would rather stay out of the limelight; steer clear of trouble. By and large, he has been successful. But in 1991, he sparked fury in the US with his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/theater/the-battle-of-miss-saigon-yellowface-art-and-opportunity.html\" title=\"\">portrayal of a Eurasian pimp</a> called the Engineer in the Broadway production of Miss Saigon. Equity labelled the role \u201can affront to the Asian community\u201d and demanded he withdraw. The ensuing standoff almost derailed the production.</p> <p>I ask whether, three decades on, he has more sympathy for Equity\u2019s objection. He says that, on the contrary, he had sympathy for it then. The experience was horrific. He felt like the lightning rod for a wider cultural storm. \u201cI mean, I was always confident that I wasn\u2019t portraying a stereotype,\u201d he insists. \u201cBut all I could do was sit back and let other people have the argument. And I got support from very strange and unwanted quarters. Charlton Heston sent me a photo of him playing Fu Manchu. He signed it: \u2018From one yellowface to another.\u2019 And I thought: \u2018That\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing, Charlton. Thanks for your support.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The point is that Pryce had always been at pains to work with multi-ethnic casts. In Stratford, on Broadway, wherever it was. \u201cSo you\u2019re thinking: \u2018What the hell is this? I\u2019m the nice guy here.\u2019 But that\u2019s the way change happens. It showed there was an inequality in the casting process. It\u2019s just tough when you\u2019re on the receiving end.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"846de730942f5e7925d5fa9cad2ec79d55ebf122\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/846de730942f5e7925d5fa9cad2ec79d55ebf122/0_0_2160_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Pryce (right) as Cardinal Bergoglio, right, and Anthony Hopkins as Pope Benedict in The Two Popes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Pryce (right) as Cardinal Bergoglio, right, and Anthony Hopkins as Pope Benedict in The Two Popes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Mountain/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It infuriated him then. It still rankles today. \u201cYou know, I was in New York recently, at an influencer, as I think they call them. Academy members watch your film. You meet them. Schmooze-fest. And this Asian lady grabbed my arm and was shouting: \u2018I protest you! I protest you!\u2019 Talking about what she\u2019d done 30 years ago. \u2018I stuck paper down your toilet in the theatre!\u2019 Because we had protesters who used to come to the show to disrupt it.\u201d</p> <p>Pryce appears to be giving the protester a comedy accent. I hope this wasn\u2019t the voice he used for his Eurasian pimp. Anyway, he continues, the upshot was that, at the end of this rant, she still wanted to have her picture taken with him. \u201cAnd then, in the photo, she\u2019s pointing like this in my face. Saying: \u2018I protest him!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>We are still sitting in the corner of our becalmed London bar. By this point, Pryce has turned a little wild-eyed. A woman sidles over and apologises for interrupting, but says she simply had to say hello. She says she is from his home town of Holywell in north Wales and adds: \u201cDid you know there\u2019s a big picture of you up in the local pub?\u201d</p> <p>Pryce shakes his head distractedly. \u201cYou should go back and see it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It is funny, he confides, people tend to think he is Jewish. Even Mel Brooks, of all people, assumed that he was. In fact, he is a Celt, raised Presbyterian, the son of a miner who later ran a grocer\u2019s shop. \u201cBut I left home when I was 18,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve got fond memories of home and I\u2019ve got negative memories of home. I don\u2019t really get back there as much as I should.\u201d</p> <p>Some years back, he returned to Holywell for a school reunion. It was nice; he met classmates he hadn\u2019t seen in decades. \u201cBut I was thinking: \u2018Oh my God, they all look really old. Thank God I don\u2019t look like that.\u2019 Then we did a group picture. And then they sent it to me.\u201d He dissolves with laughter. \u201cAnd in among all those old people was just another old person.\u201d</p> <p>Our conversation has been a little choppy. All the same, I am pleased Pryce is finally being honoured by the Academy. By rights, he should have been nominated for Brazil, for Carrington or for his role as Glenn Close\u2019s preening novelist husband in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/12/the-wife-review-glenn-close-brilliant-toronto-film-festival-tiff-2017\" title=\"\">The Wife</a>. I ask which of his roles he feels was unfairly overlooked, and he chuckles and says it is not a question he can answer. \u201cIt reminds me of the argument we\u2019re having now about women who should have been nominated, or ethnic minorities who should have been nominated, when people forget that it\u2019s a competition, it\u2019s a \u2018Who\u2019s best?\u2019 I mean, when I vote or when I look at a film, I don\u2019t think: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a woman director, therefore I\u2019ll watch it in a different way.\u2019 I\u2019ll watch it as a film and judge it as that.\u201d</p> <p>Hang on, I tell him, it is not as simple as that. He is assuming there exists an objective standard of excellence. The truth surely, is that our ideas of what is good and what is bad are conditioned by a whole bunch of factors: gender, ethnicity, class, what have you. If people are angered by this year\u2019s Oscars, it is because they feel the Academy is not representative of cinema as a whole. If you broadened the voter base, you would get a richer spread of nominees.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve heard this argument forward. But it\u2019s rather patronising to say: if we get more African-Carribean actors they\u2019ll only vote for African-Carribean films. And I\u2019ll only vote for Welsh films! In some ways you can\u2019t believe we\u2019re still having these arguments. But we are and they\u2019re real and they can be addressed. </p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s only a fucking prize! And what we have to do is tackle the industry at large and society at large \u2013 because people generally are herd-like and tribal.\u201d</p> <p>He reaches for his water. People view the world \u2013 or the Oscar nominations \u2013 from their own particular vantage point, he says. He gulps his drink and attempts a joke: \u201cI think there\u2019s a definite shortage of 72-year-old Welsh men.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Man Who Killed Don Quixote is released on 31 January.

      "bodyText": "It is the day after the Oscar nominations, and Jonathan Pryce is perched at a corner table in a humdrum London bar, guest of honour at the saddest celebration in town. His first best-actor nomination has been a long time coming. At the age of 72, he has arrived. \u201cBest newcomer,\u201d he says ruefully. \u201cAlthough I already do have a best newcomer award. It was for Breaking Glass. Back in 1980.\u201d It is no surprise to see Pryce honoured for his lovely performance in The Two Popes, a likable Netflix drama that spotlights the bromance between Benedict and Francis, but it knocked him sideways all the same. He had not thought he stood a chance; he had just come out of the shower when the news came through. Since then, his phone has barely stopped buzzing. Congratulations and requests. Demands on his time. \u201cBut it\u2019s great,\u201d he adds quickly, and almost sounds as if he means it. Whether by accident or design, Pryce has spent much of his career as the quiet man of British acting; the coiled spring in the works, unobtrusive, precise and usually critical, whether he is playing a Bond villain on screen or Shylock on stage; Cardinal Wolsey in Wolf Hall or the High Sparrow in Game of Thrones. Like Pope Francis, perhaps, he is the connoisseur\u2019s choice, the progressive dark horse. Still, you should never make the mistake of confusing an actor with the characters they play. His latest appearance, in Terry Gilliam\u2019s The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, brings him full circle. It was Gilliam who provided Pryce with his breakthrough role in 1985\u2019s Brazil, and the two have remained firm friends ever since. The film itself is a rackety, rambunctious affair. Adam Driver headlines as a jaded commercials director at large in rural Spain. Pryce co-stars as Javier, a deluded old shoemaker who fancies himself as Quixote. He comes clip-clopping through the desert in tin-pan armour, his peevish stare fixed on the far horizon. The way Pryce tells it, he was essentially playing two men at the same time. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the get-out-of-jail card.

      "body": "<p>Twenty minutes after we meet, I worry that I\u2019ve given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/toby-jones\">Toby Jones</a> some kind of existential crisis. \u201cWhy are people so interested in what performers have to <em>say</em>?\u201d he exclaims, genuine angst etched on to his face. \u201cActors talking about acting has to be has to be one of the most appalling things to read. I mean, it makes you scream!\u201d</p> <p>He swivels on his chair, gazing towards the window and into the night beyond. \u201cIt\u2019s just \u2026 well, it\u2019s not something you can \u2026 sort of really describe,\u201d he adds, turning back towards me and looking at me with his big, boyish eyes.</p> <p>Blimey. All I\u2019d asked is what drew him to acting in the first place. But, if he\u2019s worried about taking himself too seriously \u2013 if it all feels a little, well, inexplicable \u2013 you can perhaps understand why.

I mean, it makes you scream!\u201d He swivels on his chair, gazing towards the window and into the night beyond. \u201cIt\u2019s just \u2026 well, it\u2019s not something you can \u2026 sort of really describe,\u201d he adds, turning back towards me and looking at me with his big, boyish eyes.

A pitch-perfect turn as Truman Capote in the 2006 docudrama Infamous stole the show from Daniel Craig and Sandra Bullock, and the bit parts and voiceovers transmogrified into meaty roles.

The woman was sexually assaulted by the men, believed to be rugby players from south Wales, in a hotel room in Plymouth, Devon, in 1978. She said she had left home after the attack because she felt ashamed and still suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Detectives have released efit images of two witnesses who were thought to be part of the team but were apparently shocked at the actions of the other men and seemed to want to stop them. The woman said: \u201cIn late January 1978, aged 17, I was raped by a group of men who claimed to be part of a south Wales touring rugby team. \u201cThese rapes took place in a room at the top of the Strathmore hotel, Plymouth. At the time, I was around eight and a half stone [55kg] and incapable of preventing these men from physically overpowering me.\u201d Appealing directly to the two featured in the efit, the woman said: \u201cYou appeared at the time to want to stop the attack and you also appeared to be shocked by the action of your team mates. I would like you to know that I was very young and very scared and that the impact of your team-mates\u2019 rape on that Saturday afternoon has affected me every day for 42 years. \u201cThe shame of not being able to stop the attack caused me to leave home, aged 17. Even now at 59, I suffer from PTSD. \u201cYou may well have daughters or granddaughters of your own by now. There are not many people who truly get the opportunity in their lives to right such a dreadful wrong. The fact that you actually know the identities of all of my rapists gives you this unique opportunity. Please help me by coming forward and identifying your team-mates who raped me.\u201d Making a wider appeal to anyone who has information, she said: \u201cThe men who raped me came home after that event and carried on with their lives. I have lived with this trauma day in, day out for 42 years. \u201cIf you recall someone you know going away to Plymouth to play rugby or any other sport with his team-mates around this time, or you recall any gossip associated with a tour of south-west England, please contact the police.\u201d The woman added: \u201cMy rapists may now be in charge of coaching or training your loved ones as young players.

All of which is true as far as it goes (which isn\u2019t very far, or fresh) and only credible if you are the kind of romantic optimist who believes that a non-league team has a chance of winning the FA cup while 7-0 down to Man City at half time.</p> <p>What Blair\u2019s argument conveniently ignores is that other and more powerful players have long been in this game, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/04/china-defends-plans-to-spend-60bn-in-africa-over-three-years\">prominent among them China</a> which has poured billions into pursuing just this influence, while more recently Russia has used the deployment of mercenaries and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/leaked-documents-reveal-russian-effort-to-exert-influence-in-africa\">military aid</a> as leverage to the same end.</p> <p>But it is where Blair ties his ambitions to development goals that he is on perhaps the shakiest ground with its emphasis on the \u201ctransformative\u201d power of private investment.</p> <p>\u201cThe unequivocal demand I hear from African leaders,\u201d he says, reminding us of his access to those African leaders, \u201cis for investment that will spur the industrialisation of the continent and eradicate poverty \u2013 a pressing challenge, given the population growth and the fourth industrial revolution.\u201d</p> <p>And while superficially, at least, Blair\u2019s nostrum is an appealing one, the problem is that its promises have not only been largely overtaken by the harsh reality of facts on the ground, but proved hazardous as well.</p> <p>Let\u2019s begin with the sugar coating on this prospect, the notion of a \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d that will eradicate poverty even as Africa\u2019s population surges in the coming decades.</p> <p>The premise of its promoters is that, with their potential for a vast, young and untapped workforce, African countries can replicate the miracle of the east-Asian tiger economies during their emergence.</p> <p>The catch, according to a compelling school of thought, is that this is unlikely to take place. Unit costs for production on the African continent, for a variety of reasons, remain uncompetitively high and supply chains are too slow.</p> <p>Moves towards automation and cost cutting in the established tiger economies, say the same voices, make it likely that any fourth industrial revolution will be a technological one that skips Africa entirely, unfair as that seems.</p> <p>And the harsh truth is that far from promising an economic miracle which Britain can cash in on as it exits Europe, the outlook on the African continent is not a rosy one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/30/west-austerity-africa-debt-aid-loans\">The west is exporting austerity to Africa.

And even then it feels like wishful thinking.</p> <p>As Nick Dearden, the director of Global Justice Now, pointed out in the wake of the summit\u2019s announcement of some \u00a36.5bn in new British investment: the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/abolition/scramble_for_africa_article_01.shtml\">scramble for Africa</a>\u201d was carefully disguised as a humanitarian project. One hundred and fifty years later, what we saw at the UK-Africa summit today was a desperate and unseemly grab for markets, dressed up as \u2018development\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Pretending otherwise is just a grubby sleight of hand.<br></p>",

With the Davos-y zeal that is the hallmark of what might be called the business-development complex, Blair suggests \u2013 like some latterday Milo Minderbinder out of Catch 22 \u2013 that what\u2019s good for Britain plc inevitably will be good for African countries. Blair\u2019s is a \u201cgreat game\u201d kind of spin, talking up the \u201cfresh competition for influence in Africa\u201d. All of which is true as far as it goes (which isn\u2019t very far, or fresh) and only credible if you are the kind of romantic optimist who believes that a non-league team has a chance of winning the FA cup while 7-0 down to Man City at half time. What Blair\u2019s argument conveniently ignores is that other and more powerful players have long been in this game, prominent among them China which has poured billions into pursuing just this influence, while more recently Russia has used the deployment of mercenaries and military aid as leverage to the same end. But it is where Blair ties his ambitions to development goals that he is on perhaps the shakiest ground with its emphasis on the \u201ctransformative\u201d power of private investment. \u201cThe unequivocal demand I hear from African leaders,\u201d he says, reminding us of his access to those African leaders, \u201cis for investment that will spur the industrialisation of the continent and eradicate poverty \u2013 a pressing challenge, given the population growth and the fourth industrial revolution.\u201d And while superficially, at least, Blair\u2019s nostrum is an appealing one, the problem is that its promises have not only been largely overtaken by the harsh reality of facts on the ground, but proved hazardous as well. Let\u2019s begin with the sugar coating on this prospect, the notion of a \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d that will eradicate poverty even as Africa\u2019s population surges in the coming decades. The premise of its promoters is that, with their potential for a vast, young and untapped workforce, African countries can replicate the miracle of the east-Asian tiger economies during their emergence. The catch, according to a compelling school of thought, is that this is unlikely to take place. Unit costs for production on the African continent, for a variety of reasons, remain uncompetitively high and supply chains are too slow. Moves towards automation and cost cutting in the established tiger economies, say the same voices, make it likely that any fourth industrial revolution will be a technological one that skips Africa entirely, unfair as that seems. And the harsh truth is that far from promising an economic miracle which Britain can cash in on as it exits Europe, the outlook on the African continent is not a rosy one. The money that China has gifted to African countries in recent years means that, far from enjoying an economic renaissance, the continent may be on the brink of a painful new debt crisis. Replicating the last debt crisis in the 1990s \u2013 when high commodity prices fuelled a borrowing spree that became unaffordable as those same commodity prices collapsed \u2013 the only difference this time round is that, with the current debt held in more opaque circumstances, it will be far harder to forgive than at the successful culmination of the Drop the Debt campaign. As the International Monetary Fund\u2019s managing director Kristalina Georgieva warned in November, echoing the World Bank\u2019s own alarm, about 40% of countries on the continent have worrying levels of debt including Ethiopia, one of the success stories cited by Blair. It has not only been the IMF and World Bank ringing the warning bell. As the UN\u2019s World Economic Situation and Prospects [WESP] report, published last week, makes clear, the global economy, and Africa in particular, faces serious challenges in the immediate future that not only cloud the medium-term economic outlook, but raise major questions over the achievability of the 2030 goal of poverty eradication in the sustainable development goals. Indeed, the continent\u2019s most developed economy, South Africa, is expected to grow at just 0.7% this year and 1.1% in 2020 while leading oil exporter Nigeria will grow at 2.3% this year and 2.5% next. The reality \u2013 despite the fine words and window dressing \u2013 is that the UK-Africa investment summit has little to do with development and good governance in Africa, and everything to do with a diminished Britain desperately looking for new markets post-Brexit. And even then it feels like wishful thinking. As Nick Dearden, the director of Global Justice Now, pointed out in the wake of the summit\u2019s announcement of some \u00a36.5bn in new British investment: the \u201cscramble for Africa\u201d was carefully disguised as a humanitarian project. One hundred and fifty years later, what we saw at the UK-Africa summit today was a desperate and unseemly grab for markets, dressed up as \u2018development\u2019.\u201d Pretending otherwise is just a grubby sleight of hand.",

But it would be impossible to scan the centuries of Britain\u2019s history without coming across a few incidents that evoke not pride but shame. Among those I would list are the creation by British officialdom in South Africa of the concentration camp, to persecute the families of Boers. Add to that the Amritsar massacre of 1919 and the <a href=\"https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1959/jun/16/hola-detention-camp\" title=\"\">Hola camps</a> set up and run during the struggle against Mau Mau.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The northern and western regions were swept by a pogrom in which thousands of Igbo were slaughtered</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But there is one truly disgusting policy practised by our officialdom during the lifetime of anyone over 50, and one word will suffice: Biafra.</p> <p>This referred to the civil war in Nigeria that ended 50 years ago this month. It stemmed from the decision of the people of the eastern region of that already riot-racked country to strike for independence as the Republic of Biafra. As I learned when I got there as a BBC correspondent, the Biafrans, mostly of the Igbo people, had their reasons.</p> <p>The federal government in Lagos was a brutal military dictatorship that came to power in 1966 in a bloodbath. During and following that coup, the northern and western regions were swept by a pogrom in which thousands of resident Igbo were slaughtered. The federal government lifted not a finger to help. It was led by an affable British-educated colonel, Yakubu Gowon. But he was a puppet. The true rulers were a group of northern Nigerian colonels. The crisis deepened, and in early 1967 eastern Nigeria, harbouring about 1.8 million refugees, sought restitution. A British-organised conference was held in Ghana and a concordat agreed. But Gowon, returning home, was flatly contradicted by the colonels, who tore up his terms and reneged on the lot. In April the Eastern Region formally seceded and on 7 July, the federal government declared war.</p> <p>Biafra was led by the Eastern Region\u2019s Oxford-educated former military governor, \u201cEmeka\u201d Ojukwu. London, ignoring all evidence that it was Lagos that reneged on the deal, denounced the secession, made no attempt to mediate and declared total support for Nigeria.</p> <p>I arrived in the Biafra capital of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enugu\" title=\"\">Enugu</a> on the third day of the war. In London I had been copiously briefed by Gerald Watrous, head of the BBC\u2019s West Africa Service. What I did not know was that he was the obedient servant of the government\u2019s Commonwealth Relations Office (CRO), which believed every word of its high commissioner in Lagos, David Hunt. It took two days in Enugu to realise that everything I had been told was utter garbage.</p> <p>I had been briefed that the brilliant Nigerian army would suppress the rebellion in two weeks, four at the most. Fortunately the deputy high commissioner in Enugu, Jim Parker, told me what was really happening. It became clear that the rubbish believed by the CRO and the BBC stemmed from our high commissioner in Lagos. A racist and a snob, Hunt expected Africans to leap to attention when he entered the room \u2013 which Gowon did. At their single prewar meeting Ojukwu did not. Hunt loathed him at once.</p> <p>My brief was to report the all-conquering march of the Nigerian army. It did not happen. Naively, I filed this. When my report was broadcast our high commissioner complained to the CRO in London, who passed it on to the BBC \u2013 which accused me of pro-rebel bias and recalled me to London. Six months later, in February 1968, fed up with the slavishness of the BBC to Whitehall, I walked out and flew back to west Africa. Ojukwu roared with laughter and allowed me to stay. My condition was that, having rejected British propaganda, I would not publish his either. He agreed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"367f6988a009b2b4372189898513b0a1eabf898b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/367f6988a009b2b4372189898513b0a1eabf898b/0_262_3906_2344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harold Wilson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Weapons and ammunition poured in quietly as Whitehall and the Harold Wilson government lied and denied it all.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But things had changed. British covert interference had become huge. Weapons and ammunition poured in quietly as Whitehall and the Harold Wilson government lied and denied it all. Much enlarged, with fresh weapons and secret advisory teams, the Nigerian army inched across Biafra as the defenders tried to fight back with a few bullets a day. Soviet Ilyushin bombers ranged overhead, dropping 1,000lb bombs on straw villages. But the transformation came in July.</p> <p>Missionaries had noticed mothers emerging from the deep bush carrying children reduced to living skeletons yet with bloated bellies. Catholic priests recognised the symptoms \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/kwashiorkor/\" title=\"\">kwashiorkor</a> or acute protein deficiency. </p> <p>That same July the Daily Express cameraman David Cairns ran off a score of rolls of film and took them to London. Back then, the British public had never seen such heartrending images of starved and dying children. When the pictures hit the newsstands the story exploded. There were headlines, questions in the House of Commons, demonstrations, marches.</p> <p>As the resident guide for foreign news teams I became somewhat overwhelmed. But at last the full secret involvement of the British government started to be exposed and the lies revealed. Wilson came under attack. The story swept Europe then the US.</p> <p>Donations flooded in. The money could buy food \u2013 but how to get it there? Around year\u2019s end the extraordinary <a href=\"https://rememberingbiafra.com/timeline/formation-of-the-joint-church-aid-jca-a-group-of-churches-from-33-countries-that-worked-together-to-increase-the-aid-flow-to-biafra\" title=\"\">Joint Church Aid</a> was born.</p> <p>The World Council of Churches helped to buy some clapped-out freighter aircraft and gained permission from Portugal to use the offshore island S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 as a base. Scandinavian pilots and crew, mostly airline pilots, offered to fly without pay. Joint Church Aid was quickly nicknamed Jesus Christ Airlines. And thus came into being the world\u2019s only <em>illegal</em> mercy air bridge.</p> <p>On a visit to London in spring 1969 I learned the efforts the British establishment will take to cover up its tracks. Every reporter, peer or parliamentarian who had visited Biafra and reported on what he had seen was smeared as a stooge of Biafra \u2013 even the utterly honourable John Hunt, leader of the Everest expedition.</p> <p>Throughout 1969 the relief planes flew through the night, dodging Nigerian MiG fighters, to deliver their life-giving cargoes of reinforced milk powder to a jungle airstrip. From there trucks took the sacks to the missions, the nuns boiled up the nutriments and kept thousands of children alive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/jan/07/half-of-a-yellow-sun-summons-a-gilded-age-as-well-as-an-atrocious-war\">Half of a Yellow Sun summons a gilded age as well as an atrocious war</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Karl Jaggi, head of the Red Cross, estimated that up to a million children died, but that at least half a million were saved.

Why? Did they love the corruption-riven, dictator-prone Nigeria? No. From start to finish, it was to cover up that the UK\u2019s assessment of the Nigerian situation was an enormous judgmental screw-up. And, worse: with neutrality and diplomacy from London it could all have been avoided.</p> <p>Biafra is little discussed in the UK these days \u2013 a conflict overshadowed geopolitically by the Vietnam war, which raged at the same time.

My brief was to report the all-conquering march of the Nigerian army. It did not happen. Naively, I filed this. When my report was broadcast our high commissioner complained to the CRO in London, who passed it on to the BBC \u2013 which accused me of pro-rebel bias and recalled me to London. Six months later, in February 1968, fed up with the slavishness of the BBC to Whitehall, I walked out and flew back to west Africa. Ojukwu roared with laughter and allowed me to stay. My condition was that, having rejected British propaganda, I would not publish his either. He agreed. But things had changed. British covert interference had become huge. Weapons and ammunition poured in quietly as Whitehall and the Harold Wilson government lied and denied it all. Much enlarged, with fresh weapons and secret advisory teams, the Nigerian army inched across Biafra as the defenders tried to fight back with a few bullets a day. Soviet Ilyushin bombers ranged overhead, dropping 1,000lb bombs on straw villages. But the transformation came in July. Missionaries had noticed mothers emerging from the deep bush carrying children reduced to living skeletons yet with bloated bellies. Catholic priests recognised the symptoms \u2013 kwashiorkor or acute protein deficiency. That same July the Daily Express cameraman David Cairns ran off a score of rolls of film and took them to London. Back then, the British public had never seen such heartrending images of starved and dying children. When the pictures hit the newsstands the story exploded. There were headlines, questions in the House of Commons, demonstrations, marches. As the resident guide for foreign news teams I became somewhat overwhelmed. But at last the full secret involvement of the British government started to be exposed and the lies revealed. Wilson came under attack. The story swept Europe then the US. Donations flooded in. The money could buy food \u2013 but how to get it there? Around year\u2019s end the extraordinary Joint Church Aid was born. The World Council of Churches helped to buy some clapped-out freighter aircraft and gained permission from Portugal to use the offshore island S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 as a base. Scandinavian pilots and crew, mostly airline pilots, offered to fly without pay. Joint Church Aid was quickly nicknamed Jesus Christ Airlines. And thus came into being the world\u2019s only illegal mercy air bridge. On a visit to London in spring 1969 I learned the efforts the British establishment will take to cover up its tracks. Every reporter, peer or parliamentarian who had visited Biafra and reported on what he had seen was smeared as a stooge of Biafra \u2013 even the utterly honourable John Hunt, leader of the Everest expedition. Throughout 1969 the relief planes flew through the night, dodging Nigerian MiG fighters, to deliver their life-giving cargoes of reinforced milk powder to a jungle airstrip. From there trucks took the sacks to the missions, the nuns boiled up the nutriments and kept thousands of children alive. Karl Jaggi, head of the Red Cross, estimated that up to a million children died, but that at least half a million were saved. As for me, sometimes in the wee small hours I see the stick-like children with the dull eyes and lolling heads, and hear their wails of hunger and the low moans as they died. What is truly shameful is that this was not done by savages but aided and assisted at every stage by Oxbridge-educated British mandarins. Why? Did they love the corruption-riven, dictator-prone Nigeria? No. From start to finish, it was to cover up that the UK\u2019s assessment of the Nigerian situation was an enormous judgmental screw-up. And, worse: with neutrality and diplomacy from London it could all have been avoided. Biafra is little discussed in the UK these days \u2013 a conflict overshadowed geopolitically by the Vietnam war, which raged at the same time. Yet the sheer nastiness of the British establishment during those three years remains a source of deep shame that we should never forget. \u2022 Frederick Forsyth is a former war correspondent and an author",

      "bodyText": "A decision on the future of the disputed site of Ihum\u0101tao outside Auckland is imminent, according to a protest organiser Pania Newton. The sacred site in south Auckland was seized by the Crown in 1863, and sold to private developer Fletcher Building in 2016, which planned to put housing on the land. In August last year M\u0101ori activists seized Ihum\u0101tao and staged a mass occupation, with thousands of New Zealanders travelling from around the country to take part in the sit-in. The aim of the occupation was to reclaim the land for M\u0101ori and all New Zealanders as a public space. On Tuesday, Fletcher building took down their fences and infrastructure on the disputed site, and Newton said an agreement between the government and protestors was close. \u201cFor us here on the whenua [land] it\u2019s a huge relief and for us its a sign that our conversations are progressing well and that we can expect a resolution in the coming days\u201d said Newton, on Tuesday and looking relaxed, as Fletchers packed up fences behind her. \u201cTonight we\u2019ll hold a whanau [family] hui [meeting] to discuss matters moving forward and it\u2019s amazing that we\u2019re able to tell them today that Fletchers are packing away the last of their equipment on the whenua [land] \u2013 to us that indicates that a resolution is just around the corner.\u201d Newton said it was a relief the final details of the agreement were being worked through: \u201cthe sooner the better for us\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re working towards ensuring this land is returned back to mana whenua [people of the land] for all New Zealanders to enjoy and for all those who whakapapa [geneology] back to this land.\u201d Last year, the M\u0101ori king ruled that the disputed land of Ihum\u0101tao should be returned, paving the way for an intervention by the government that could set a precedent in indigenous land disputes across the country. Kiingi T\u016bheitia Potatau Te Wherowhero VII ruled that Ihum\u0101tao should be returned to M\u0101ori ownership, and that the process would sit outside the Treaty of Waitangi process to find an \u201cinnovative and modern solution that does not financially disadvantage iwi [tribes]\u201d. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has refused repeated calls to visit the site, and has been criticised for her hands-off approach to the dispute, leaving negotiating to her senior M\u0101ori ministers. However Ardern did ask Fletchers to halt construction on the site, and the atmosphere at Ihum\u0101tao remained peaceful throughout months of occupation.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s health ministry has confirmed human-to-human transmission of a mysterious Sars-like virus that has spread across the country and fuelled anxiety about the prospect of a major outbreak as millions begin travelling for lunar new year celebrations. Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert and head of the national health commission team investigating the outbreak, confirmed that two cases of infection in China\u2019s Guangdong province had been caused by human-to-human transmission and medical staff had been infected, China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency said on Monday. Authorities earlier reported 139 new cases of the new strain of coronavirus over the weekend, bringing the total number of infected patients to 217 since the virus was first detected last month in the central city of Wuhan. It was also confirmed on Tuesday that an 89-year-old man had died from the virus in Wuhan, bringing the number of fatalities to four. Cases were confirmed in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong province in the south, heightening fears ahead of the lunar new year holiday, when more than 400 million people are expected to travel domestically and internationally. State broadcaster CCTV said on Monday evening there were seven suspected cases in other parts of the country, including Shandong in the east, and the south-western provinces of Sichuan, Guangxi and Yunnan. Five people who travelled from Wuhan were also being treated for fevers in Zhejiang province. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed,\u201d said China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, weighing in on the matter for the first time. The strain has caused alarm because of its connection to severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03. The current outbreak has spread to Thailand, Japan and South Korea. A man was in isolation in Brisbane, Australia after being suspected of having the virus after he returned from a visit to Wuhan. China\u2019s National Health Commission said it had sent working groups to all provinces to oversee outbreak prevention, describing the situation as \u201ccontrollable\u201d. Hospitals in Shanghai and Beijing and in Zhejiang province have \u201ccomprehensively\u201d strengthened examination procedures. In Shenzhen, temperature checks have been put in place in airports, ports and railway stations. More than 100 patients with symptoms were waiting to be seen at the Xiehe hospital in Wuhan at 6am on Monday. \u201cIf you are coming now, you have to wait between three and four hours before you can see the doctors,\u201d a hospital worker said by phone. At a hospital in Chaoyang district in Beijing, patients were being given masks and forms to fill out, detailing any recent travel to Wuhan. A nurse said preventive measures were also being taken to protect doctors Coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people, and the outbreak in Wuhan has been linked to a now-closed seafood market where live animals were reportedly sold. The World Health Organization has said an animal source was \u201cthe most likely primary source\u201d of the outbreak, with \u201csome limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts\u201d. Researchers worry the number of infections has been severely underestimated. The WHO said it would convene an emergency meeting in Geneva on Wednesday to discuss whether the new coronavirus constituted an international health emergency. Xi Chen, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said the likelihood of human-to-human transmission had appeared large given how many cases were confirmed. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see all these cases coming from animals at the same market,\u201d Chen said. For weeks, the only reported cases were in Wuhan and areas outside mainland China, prompting many people to question whether other cities were simply not reporting or testing for the virus.

Central banks also needed to overhaul the way they valued assets \u201c to reflect climate-related risks\u201d. The BIS said a carbon price alone might not be enough to drive change because of the large amount of inertia in the global economic system. \u201cFor instance, proactive fiscal policy may be an essential first step to build adequate infrastructure (eg railroads), before carbon pricing can really lead agents to modify their behaviour (eg by switching from car to train).\u201d",

      "body": "<p> With a toothless grin and a clenched fist raised to the heavens, 90-year-old Asma Khatun chanted exuberantly. \u201cAzadi,\u201d she cried, using the Hindi word for freedom and joining a loud chorus that rang out across Shaheen Bagh, a neighbourhood in South Delhi that over the past few weeks has become a nationwide symbol of resistance.</p> \n<p>In her nine decades, Khatun has lived through British colonial rule, the war of independence and India\u2019s bloody partition with Pakistan, but as a housewife she had always stayed behind closed doors and barely brushed with politics. That was until last month.</p> \n<p>For over 40 days, the frail but feisty 90-year-old has been camped out on the streets day and night, side by side with hundreds of women and braving Delhi\u2019s coldest temperatures for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-50953950\">more than a century</a>. \u201cI am old, my bones hurt in the cold and my children are very worried about my health, but I am sitting here because I will not stand by as Mr Modi tries to break up India, to tell me that this is not my home after 90 years,\u201d said Khatun.</p> \n<p>She added defiantly: \u201cScared? Who said anything about fear. I have never been in a protest before but I will not be moving and if I die here, then I will die fighting for my children and my country.\u201d</p> \n<p>The unrest that engulfed India last month after the passing of a new citizenship law that many believe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/india-to-bring-in-law-denying-citizenship-to-muslim-migrants\">openly discriminates against Muslims</a> and undermines the secular foundations of India\u2019s constitution has shown no sign of abating. Every week, millions have continued to take to the streets against the Citizenship Amendment Act, and what many see as an unacceptable attempt by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his BJP government to implement their Hindutva [Hindu nationalist] agenda and redefine India as a purely Hindu country. While the government has attempted to quash the protests, with bans on gatherings of more than four people and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/we-are-not-safe-indias-muslims-tell-of-wave-of-police-brutality\">increasing police violence and torture</a>, it has only fuelled the fire of discontent across India.</p> \n<p>Strikingly, the loudest voices of dissent have largely been women. From activists and lawyers to students, housewives and grandmothers, both Hindu and Muslim, women across India have been at the forefront of the resistance to the new citizenship law, and a nationwide citizenship test, known as the NRC, which could result in millions of Muslims being declared illegal aliens in their own country. For many, it is the first time they have had any political engagement at all.</p> \n<p>The female-driven political awakening sparked by the CAA has been most jubilantly epitomised by the gathering at the Muslim-majority neighbourhood of Shaheen Bagh that began in late December, when hundreds of women blocked a main road and began a sit-in demonstration against the new citizenship law. Since then, numbers have swelled, drawing in a cross-generational, largely female crowd unlike any protest seen in India before.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff805759a746bd069161853f1a22ff9486ef59a3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff805759a746bd069161853f1a22ff9486ef59a3/0_155_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women holding a sit-in in Shaheen Bagh in December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women holding a sit-in in Shaheen Bagh in December.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Among them was 82-year-old Bilkis, who had been camped out for over a month. \u201cIn my whole life, this is the first time I have taken part in any political movement,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore this I was a housewife, I never left the house. Now I eat here and sleep here, I go back home just every couple of days to get new clothes. It is cold sometimes but it is not difficult. How can I sit by knowing that my children might be thrown out of this country which is their home and made to go to prison or sent to Pakistan? I will only leave this place when my children\u2019s lives are safe. We are powerful and Modi is now afraid.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nusrat Asra, 43, said she had abandoned her life as a housewife for the first time, to sit with the women of Shaheen Bagh every day. Her husband had initially been resistant, she said, \u201cbut now he knows why I am fighting\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am not afraid of anything, I am not afraid of the police, I am not afraid of being beaten, I am here just to stand up for freedom,\u201d said Asra animatedly, her face lit up in defiance. \u201cWe are not fighting for any god or any political party, we are fighting for our rights. And I have brought my 12-year-old daughter here every day to teach her to stand up and fight for her rights too.\u201d</p> \n<p>The reasons the protests have struck a chord with India\u2019s women are multifaceted. On a pragmatic level, they are likely to suffer disproportionately from the CAA, which requires certain documents to prove citizenship. Across India, women generally tend to have less documentation, to be poorer, more excluded from the ambit of official administration, often don\u2019t have their names on property documents, have frequently moved away from where they were born to get married and are less likely to have their births registered.</p> \n<p>Yet according to Karuna Nundy, one of India\u2019s most prominent lawyers who has been vocal against the CAA and spoken at multiple demonstrations in opposition to the law, it runs deeper than that for India\u2019s women. \u201cBeing a woman in India feeds into the experience of, and resistance to oppression. We know exclusion, and we know it viscerally,\u201d said Nundy.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s important to see how the rise of Hindutva has been powered in part by a toxic masculinity. A lot of the imagery and action around it, is very macho, violent, explicitly supremacist and hostile to women. Our constitution speaks of camaraderie between citizens. What we are seeing in some women\u2019s leadership and at Shaheen Bagh is an energy that\u2019s gentler. It\u2019s happier, more nurturing and yet strong and determined. And I think that is really speaking to the country as a counter to the toxic masculinity of Hindutva.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7aae4f19-e3dc-4d50-becd-2d1a229b093f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The new citizenship law provides a path to citizenship for religious minorities who have immigrated into India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before 31 December 2014. It explicitly lists Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians as being able to take advantage of the new provisions, excluding Muslims.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Besides stoking concern among Muslims, the proposed changes have also led to protests by residents unhappy about an influx of Hindus from Bangladesh, who stand to gain citizenship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As well as the women of Shaheen Bagh, some of the most iconic images and footage of the protests have been of women, often Hindu and Muslim side-by-side, bravely standing up to an onslaught of all-male police officers frequently sent to disperse peaceful demonstrations.</p> \n<p>One such video that went viral was five female students at Delhi\u2019s Jamia Millia Islamia university who surrounded a young man to <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/india-women-rescued-friend-police-attack-viral-video-191216150934526.html\">prevent the police beating him with batons</a> after they violently descended onto the university campus. Chanda Yadav, a 20-year-old student who was one of the five women in the clip, said she came from a conservative household in rural Uttar Pradesh where women were taught not to speak up or fight back and was the first woman from her village to take part in the demonstrations.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am not afraid,\u201d said Yadav. \u201cI wanted to save my friends and my country and that is why I fought back against the police on that day and why I have been fighting against CAA since.\u201d</p> \n<p>The spirit of Shaheen Bagh has proved infectious, and over the past two weeks, similar female-led sit-ins have cropped up across the country, including in Kolkata\u2019s Circus Maidan park. Sitting among the protestors was Navamita Chandra, 25, a student of Jadavpur University in Kolkata. She had already taken a vocal stand against CAA when she refused to accept her degree from the vice chancellor of her university in protest against the attacks by police on the students in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh during the anti-CAA and anti-NRC demonstrations. Walking onto the stage, she held a placard, which read: \u201cI cannot take my degree ceremonially when fellow students are beaten, blinded and killed.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWomen from all background are waking up and taking to the streets in unprecedented numbers, it\u2019s incredible to see ,\u201d said Chandra. \u201cWe will not let our Muslim brothers and sisters be demonised and threatened. My father is not a fan of me taking part in protests but my mother is definitely still more of a trooper \u2013 she understands why I\u2019m taking to the streets and she realises that we\u2019ve come to a point where it is more important now than ever to raise our voices.\u201d</p> \n<p>For Shafqat Rahim, a 25-year-old law student from a conservative Muslim family, the anti-CAA protests in Kolkata had been a moment of political awakening. \u201cThe protests are shaping up like a revolution where women have taken the leading roles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe, the women, will remove the fascist rulers.\u201d</p>",

In her nine decades, Khatun has lived through British colonial rule, the war of independence and India\u2019s bloody partition with Pakistan, but as a housewife she had always stayed behind closed doors and barely brushed with politics. That was until last month. For over 40 days, the frail but feisty 90-year-old has been camped out on the streets day and night, side by side with hundreds of women and braving Delhi\u2019s coldest temperatures for more than a century. \u201cI am old, my bones hurt in the cold and my children are very worried about my health, but I am sitting here because I will not stand by as Mr Modi tries to break up India, to tell me that this is not my home after 90 years,\u201d said Khatun. She added defiantly: \u201cScared? Who said anything about fear. I have never been in a protest before but I will not be moving and if I die here, then I will die fighting for my children and my country.\u201d The unrest that engulfed India last month after the passing of a new citizenship law that many believe openly discriminates against Muslims and undermines the secular foundations of India\u2019s constitution has shown no sign of abating. Every week, millions have continued to take to the streets against the Citizenship Amendment Act, and what many see as an unacceptable attempt by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his BJP government to implement their Hindutva [Hindu nationalist] agenda and redefine India as a purely Hindu country. While the government has attempted to quash the protests, with bans on gatherings of more than four people and increasing police violence and torture, it has only fuelled the fire of discontent across India. Strikingly, the loudest voices of dissent have largely been women. From activists and lawyers to students, housewives and grandmothers, both Hindu and Muslim, women across India have been at the forefront of the resistance to the new citizenship law, and a nationwide citizenship test, known as the NRC, which could result in millions of Muslims being declared illegal aliens in their own country. For many, it is the first time they have had any political engagement at all. The female-driven political awakening sparked by the CAA has been most jubilantly epitomised by the gathering at the Muslim-majority neighbourhood of Shaheen Bagh that began in late December, when hundreds of women blocked a main road and began a sit-in demonstration against the new citizenship law. Since then, numbers have swelled, drawing in a cross-generational, largely female crowd unlike any protest seen in India before. Among them was 82-year-old Bilkis, who had been camped out for over a month. \u201cIn my whole life, this is the first time I have taken part in any political movement,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore this I was a housewife, I never left the house. Now I eat here and sleep here, I go back home just every couple of days to get new clothes. It is cold sometimes but it is not difficult. How can I sit by knowing that my children might be thrown out of this country which is their home and made to go to prison or sent to Pakistan? I will only leave this place when my children\u2019s lives are safe. We are powerful and Modi is now afraid.\u201d Nusrat Asra, 43, said she had abandoned her life as a housewife for the first time, to sit with the women of Shaheen Bagh every day. Her husband had initially been resistant, she said, \u201cbut now he knows why I am fighting\u201d. \u201cI am not afraid of anything, I am not afraid of the police, I am not afraid of being beaten, I am here just to stand up for freedom,\u201d said Asra animatedly, her face lit up in defiance. \u201cWe are not fighting for any god or any political party, we are fighting for our rights. And I have brought my 12-year-old daughter here every day to teach her to stand up and fight for her rights too.\u201d The reasons the protests have struck a chord with India\u2019s women are multifaceted. On a pragmatic level, they are likely to suffer disproportionately from the CAA, which requires certain documents to prove citizenship. Across India, women generally tend to have less documentation, to be poorer, more excluded from the ambit of official administration, often don\u2019t have their names on property documents, have frequently moved away from where they were born to get married and are less likely to have their births registered. Yet according to Karuna Nundy, one of India\u2019s most prominent lawyers who has been vocal against the CAA and spoken at multiple demonstrations in opposition to the law, it runs deeper than that for India\u2019s women. \u201cBeing a woman in India feeds into the experience of, and resistance to oppression. We know exclusion, and we know it viscerally,\u201d said Nundy. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to see how the rise of Hindutva has been powered in part by a toxic masculinity. A lot of the imagery and action around it, is very macho, violent, explicitly supremacist and hostile to women. Our constitution speaks of camaraderie between citizens. What we are seeing in some women\u2019s leadership and at Shaheen Bagh is an energy that\u2019s gentler. It\u2019s happier, more nurturing and yet strong and determined. And I think that is really speaking to the country as a counter to the toxic masculinity of Hindutva.\u201d As well as the women of Shaheen Bagh, some of the most iconic images and footage of the protests have been of women, often Hindu and Muslim side-by-side, bravely standing up to an onslaught of all-male police officers frequently sent to disperse peaceful demonstrations. One such video that went viral was five female students at Delhi\u2019s Jamia Millia Islamia university who surrounded a young man to prevent the police beating him with batons after they violently descended onto the university campus. Chanda Yadav, a 20-year-old student who was one of the five women in the clip, said she came from a conservative household in rural Uttar Pradesh where women were taught not to speak up or fight back and was the first woman from her village to take part in the demonstrations. \u201cI am not afraid,\u201d said Yadav. \u201cI wanted to save my friends and my country and that is why I fought back against the police on that day and why I have been fighting against CAA since.\u201d The spirit of Shaheen Bagh has proved infectious, and over the past two weeks, similar female-led sit-ins have cropped up across the country, including in Kolkata\u2019s Circus Maidan park. Sitting among the protestors was Navamita Chandra, 25, a student of Jadavpur University in Kolkata. She had already taken a vocal stand against CAA when she refused to accept her degree from the vice chancellor of her university in protest against the attacks by police on the students in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh during the anti-CAA and anti-NRC demonstrations. Walking onto the stage, she held a placard, which read: \u201cI cannot take my degree ceremonially when fellow students are beaten, blinded and killed.\u201d \u201cWomen from all background are waking up and taking to the streets in unprecedented numbers, it\u2019s incredible to see ,\u201d said Chandra. \u201cWe will not let our Muslim brothers and sisters be demonised and threatened. My father is not a fan of me taking part in protests but my mother is definitely still more of a trooper \u2013 she understands why I\u2019m taking to the streets and she realises that we\u2019ve come to a point where it is more important now than ever to raise our voices.\u201d For Shafqat Rahim, a 25-year-old law student from a conservative Muslim family, the anti-CAA protests in Kolkata had been a moment of political awakening. \u201cThe protests are shaping up like a revolution where women have taken the leading roles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe, the women, will remove the fascist rulers.\u201d",

In an email sent to staff last December, Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy said the department was looking into what he said were \u201ca number of allegations regarding the conduct of a Treasury employee\u201d. \u201cI am taking appropriate steps to investigate the allegations,\u201d the note said. Staff at the Department of Social Services were notified of Flavel\u2019s new appointment on Friday by acting secretary Nathan Williamson, and he began the new role this week. \u201cI want to assure you that we have robust processes and procedures, including independent reviews, to deal with such matters, and these are being closely followed,\u201d Kennedy said. The email from Kennedy said his \u201cnumber one priority\u201d was the welfare of staff. \u201cI want all employees to feel comfortable to raise difficult matters at any time, without fear of any adverse action. I want every Treasury employee to feel safe in the knowledge that these matters will be dealt with sensitively and respectfully.\u201d The email encouraged staff to take up support through the department\u2019s \u201cwellbeing team\u201d or through an external employee assistance provider, with the assurance that conversations will be treated \u201cin strict confidence\u201d. Asked about the investigation at the time, Scott Morrison said the department would follow a \u201cproper process\u201d in investigating the allegations. Flavel was appointed deputy secretary of Treasury\u2019s corporate services and business strategy group in July 2017, and was serving in that role until the final week of October. He had worked at Treasury for 16 years and was previously head of the budget policy division, responsible for the delivery of three federal budgets.",

      "bodyText": "Australia will begin screening passengers on high-risk flights from China for signs of a new Sars-like coronavirus following confirmation from the Chinese health authorities that the virus has begun spreading from human to human. The outbreak was first reported in Wuhan City in China on New Year\u2019s Eve and tied to a seafood market, but officials have since confirmed that it has spread to other humans who had not frequented the market, as well as to health workers. As of Tuesday, 220 people are confirmed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus \u2013 a type of virus that spreads from animals to humans \u2013 and three people have died. Chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy announced the new screening measures on Tuesday, four days after saying additional screening at points of entry into Australia was unnecessary. A handful of cases of the new virus have been confirmed in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Chinese cities other than Wuhan, all in people who had recently been in Wuhan. There are no confirmed cases of the disease in international travellers to Australia and a number of potential passengers have been assessed by state health authorities without the presence of the disease being confirmed, Murphy said. The new screening measures will focus on a direct flight from Wuhan City to Sydney, which flies three times a week. It will be met by Border Force staff and biosecurity officers from New South Wales Health from its next scheduled arrival on Thursday. \u201cThey will be providing to all the passengers an information pamphlet in English and Mandarin, outlining the symptoms this disease might deliver and asking them to identify themselves at the border. If anyone has a fever or suspect they might have this disease and if they are suspected of having this condition, New South Wales Health will follow up as per our normal border security and biosecurity protocols,\u201d Murphy said. The most common symptom is a high fever, but patients can also show other respiratory symptoms like coughing, a sore throat and breathlessness. Murphy said authorities were also conducting \u201ccareful modelling\u201d to determine which flights form China pose the highest risk and should also be met by biosecurity staff. This includes the 160 flights that fly directly from China to Australia each week, as well as hundreds more indirect flights. Information about the virus will be placed in Mandarin and English at all points of entry into Australia, and the Australian government will also target Chinese-language media. Murphy said temperature scanning at airports would not be reinstated because it was found during the 2009 swine flu pandemic to be \u201cineffective\u201d. One of the cases of the virus in Thailand was reportedly detected by an airport temperature scanner. \u201cIt missed a large number of cases ... cases that may be incubating or afebrile,\u201d he said. \u201cIt leads to a false sense of security. It\u2019s not an effective public health mechanism.\u201d He said Australia was well-prepared to diagnose, treat and isolate anyone suspected of having the disease, but that there was no failsafe way to keep it out of the country. \u201cThe important thing to remember is with border screening you cannot absolutely prevent the spread of disease into the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe incubation period is probably a week. Many people who have this may present as asymptomatic. So it\u2019s about identifying those with a high risk and making sure those who have a high risk know about it and now how to get medical attention. \u201cThere\u2019s no way of preventing this getting into the country if this becomes bigger. We need to respond to it as we always do.\u201d Australia has not yet updated its travel advisory to China, but Murphy said the health department was in discussions with the department of foreign affairs and trade about providing some \u201cspecific advice\u201d for Wuhan \u201cas the evolving situation requires.\u201d",

It\u2019s been quite an undertaking.</p> <p>Asia TOPA is dedicated to art and performance from the Asia-Pacific region, with artists from 17 countries and regions represented this year. The festival\u2019s first iteration in 2017 spanned 280 events.

Photograph: Garth Oriander / Asia TOPA.</p></li> </ul> <p>But sheer size isn\u2019t the only thing that makes the festival\u2019s program special - what really sets Asia TOPA apart is its commitment to supporting new art from a region that doesn\u2019t get to grace the world stage as often as it should. For Australian audiences, Armstrong says, that presents the opportunity to \u201cthink outside of London, New York, Berlin as the [places] where our creative inspiration should come from\u201d.</p> <p>Armstrong also wants to showcase the breadth of the creative work that comes out of the region, and expand conceptions of what contemporary art from China, or Indonesia, or Singapore actually looks like.</p> <p>\u201cThere are so many traditions and lived experiences within these regions,\u201d he says. \u201cSocially and culturally, it couldn\u2019t be more diverse. So we\u2019re interested in promoting and profiling that diversity.\u201d</p> <p>For instance, this year\u2019s program includes<a href=\"https://www.asiatopa.com.au/whats-on/2020/contemporary-music/the-planet-a-lament\" rel=\"nofollow\"> The Planet - A Lament</a>, by pioneering Indonesian director Garin Nugroho.

Of particular importance was ensuring these curators had lived experience in the Asia-Pacific region.</p> <p>\u201c[The curators] are all young, they\u2019re dynamic and really smart. It\u2019s really enlightening and exciting. I think that the energy that comes from collaborating is felt by everybody,\u201d says Armstrong.</p> <p>\u201cThe old model of the artistic director pretending that they\u2019ve done it all by themselves - those days are gone.\u201d</p> <p>To help foster collaboration, Asia TOPA staged a series of creative labs, in which artists from Australia and the Asia-Pacific region were brought together to collaborate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"578833bc8e794ef0498fc5b6f20705caea8741c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/578833bc8e794ef0498fc5b6f20705caea8741c6/0_0_1600_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abida Parveen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abida Parveen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mobeen Ansari/Asia TOPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>There are few artists who are spoken about with the same rapturous fervour as <em><strong>Abida Parveen</strong></em>. Photograph: Mobeen Ansari / Asia TOPA.</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cEssentially, what the labs are is an opportunity for the artists to be paid to be here, to share practice and share cultural values with other artists who they could actually consider collaborating with,\u201d Armstrong says.</p> <p>\u201cBut the beauty of the labs is they do not require outcomes.

      "bodyText": "Asia TOPA has grown so big that even the team behind the festival doesn\u2019t know precisely how many events it has scheduled for this summer. \u201cFor our own sanity\u2019s sake we stopped counting as the free public program is still evolving,\u201d says Stephen Armstrong, Asia TOPA\u2019s creative director. Together with associate director Kate Ben-Tovim and a team of curators, Armstrong has spent the past three years pulling together the mammoth 2020 program. It\u2019s been quite an undertaking. Asia TOPA is dedicated to art and performance from the Asia-Pacific region, with artists from 17 countries and regions represented this year. The festival\u2019s first iteration in 2017 spanned 280 events. The 2020 festival will be even bigger, with an array of music, dance, theatre, film and visual art spread across three full months from January to March. The Planet \u2013 A Lament (left) imparts a moving story of creation set against the backdrop of environmental disaster. Photograph: Asia TOPA. BLACK TIES (right) is a hilarious and heart-warming immersive theatre experience that reminds us of the power of love to reach across the gulfs that divide us. Photograph: Garth Oriander / Asia TOPA. But sheer size isn\u2019t the only thing that makes the festival\u2019s program special - what really sets Asia TOPA apart is its commitment to supporting new art from a region that doesn\u2019t get to grace the world stage as often as it should. For Australian audiences, Armstrong says, that presents the opportunity to \u201cthink outside of London, New York, Berlin as the [places] where our creative inspiration should come from\u201d. Armstrong also wants to showcase the breadth of the creative work that comes out of the region, and expand conceptions of what contemporary art from China, or Indonesia, or Singapore actually looks like. \u201cThere are so many traditions and lived experiences within these regions,\u201d he says. \u201cSocially and culturally, it couldn\u2019t be more diverse. So we\u2019re interested in promoting and profiling that diversity.\u201d For instance, this year\u2019s program includes The Planet - A Lament, by pioneering Indonesian director Garin Nugroho. It\u2019s a work that blends film, dance and song to highlight the religious and cultural diversity in contemporary Indonesia. \u201cWorks that look at the complexity of the region are really important,\u201d says Kate Ben-Tovim. Asia TOPA celebrates the legendary composer-conductor Joe Hisaishi with a huge encore performance of his music from the films of Studio Ghibli. Photograph: Daniel Aulsebrook / Asia TOPA. Armstrong and Ben-Tovim have plenty to be proud of in this year\u2019s program, including a strong focus on female artists (\u201cThat was really important to us,\u201d Ben-Tovim says) and being able to give new opportunities to First Nations creators. They\u2019re also excited to have been able to book iconic shows such as the Studio Ghibli extravaganza with Joe Hisaishi, which have an important cultural meaning to specific communities, and artists such as legendary Sufi singer Adiba Parveen, who rarely plays outside her native Pakistan and will be making her Australian debut at Asia TOPA. To pull the program together, the pair worked with a number of curators who had deep expertise in their field. Of particular importance was ensuring these curators had lived experience in the Asia-Pacific region. \u201c[The curators] are all young, they\u2019re dynamic and really smart. It\u2019s really enlightening and exciting. I think that the energy that comes from collaborating is felt by everybody,\u201d says Armstrong. \u201cThe old model of the artistic director pretending that they\u2019ve done it all by themselves - those days are gone.\u201d To help foster collaboration, Asia TOPA staged a series of creative labs, in which artists from Australia and the Asia-Pacific region were brought together to collaborate. There are few artists who are spoken about with the same rapturous fervour as Abida Parveen. Photograph: Mobeen Ansari / Asia TOPA. \u201cEssentially, what the labs are is an opportunity for the artists to be paid to be here, to share practice and share cultural values with other artists who they could actually consider collaborating with,\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cBut the beauty of the labs is they do not require outcomes. You come, you experience, you share and that\u2019s it. The experience has profound impacts on everybody and if that results in a new collaborative project that is a total bonus.\u201d One of the festival\u2019s key focuses is supporting original work, and many of this year\u2019s commissions originated from those labs. The 2020 co-commissions include BLACK TIES, a laugh-out-loud play that follows the wedding of a Maori woman to an Aboriginal man; Metal, an Indonesian heavy metal choir created by Lucy Guerin; and Virtual Intimacy, an Australian and Taiwanese collaboration that explores queer culture through technology and dating apps. By co-commissioning with other festivals and arts bodies, Asia TOPA has been able to share the financial load of putting together a production, and ultimately create more work.

Virtual Intimacy explores our relationships with technology and the ways in which it shapes our relationships with others.

      "body": "<p>The average low-income family in the UK\u2019s most deprived areas \u2013 including \u201cleft behind\u201d communities in the north of England \u2013 is likely to be worse off under universal credit, according to a study by the <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/\">Resolution Foundation</a>.</p> <p>Although the government\u2019s reversal of some of the cuts it made five years ago to universal credit will make the average UK family \u00a31 a week better off than under previous benefits, the study says those living in the poorest areas will be on average worse off.</p> <p>The thinktank says the economies of those areas with high numbers of disabled, unemployed or single-parent claimants \u2013 all groups likely to lose out under the new system \u2013 will see falls in spending power when universal credit is fully rolled out.</p> <p>Official data indicates that the deprived areas most closely matching this profile and where, on average, families will be worse off under universal credit, include places that unexpectedly voted for the government at the last election such as Blackpool, Middlesbrough, Redcar, Hyndburn and Wolverhampton.</p> <p>After its victory, the government promised to regenerate fragile post-industrial economies in the Midlands, the north and north-east of England where it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/boris-johnson-plans-to-go-on-spending-spree-in-north\">won a swath of previously staunch Labour-voting parliamentary</a> seats known as the \u201cred wall\u201d. </p> <p>Other areas where families are on average likely to be worse off when they move on to universal credit include Liverpool, Birmingham, Glasgow, Burnley, Kingston-upon-Hull, Blaenau Gwent, Knowsley and Hartlepool.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/03/why-iain-duncan-smith-knighthood-was-a-slap-in-the-face\">Why Iain Duncan Smith knighthood was \u2018slap in the face\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Universal credit will pay out more than \u00a360bn a year nationally by 2023. That many of the UK\u2019s poorest local areas will be net average losers under universal credit is \u201csomething currently being ignored amid growing debates about how to level up economic outcomes across Britain\u201d, says the foundation.</p> <p>Laura Gardiner, research director at Resolution, said some areas of the country would fare particularly badly under universal credit and understanding that \u201cshould be central to policy debates that are rightly focusing on what can be done to close economic gaps between parts of the UK\u201d.</p> <p>The foundation also called for further changes to the design and generosity of universal credit to make the system easier for claimants to use and to ensure it meets its original aims of simplifying benefits, improving incentives to move into work and cutting poverty.</p> <p>\u201cWith the reputation of universal credit under significant threat, now is the time for the government and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to really understand how it is working on the ground in order to make necessary changes,\u201d it says.</p> <p>While overall UK benefit spending will be maintained under universal credit, this masks a \u201csubstantial redistribution\u201d of support between different areas of the country, says Resolution, with resources skewed towards families in high-rent areas like London and the south-east over the north and Midlands.</p> <p>The thinktank illustrates this by highlighting the effect on Liverpool and its surrounding boroughs, where 52% of all claimants will be worse off on universal credit by 2024, compared with a national average of 46%. This rises to 65% for Merseyside families with a disabled member (60% UK-wide). On average, Merseyside families will lose \u00a37 a week.</p> <p>With the return of a Tory government, the foundation concludes that universal credit, despite its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/15/universal-credit-savaged-by-public-spending-watchdog-nao\">turbulent history</a>, is now \u201cdefinitely going ahead\u201d. Labour had promised a root-and-branch overhaul of what it had called a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/27/labour-promises-to-overhaul-cruel-universal-credit-system\">\u201ccruel and inhuman\u201d</a> system.

      "bodyText": "The average low-income family in the UK\u2019s most deprived areas \u2013 including \u201cleft behind\u201d communities in the north of England \u2013 is likely to be worse off under universal credit, according to a study by the Resolution Foundation. Although the government\u2019s reversal of some of the cuts it made five years ago to universal credit will make the average UK family \u00a31 a week better off than under previous benefits, the study says those living in the poorest areas will be on average worse off. The thinktank says the economies of those areas with high numbers of disabled, unemployed or single-parent claimants \u2013 all groups likely to lose out under the new system \u2013 will see falls in spending power when universal credit is fully rolled out. Official data indicates that the deprived areas most closely matching this profile and where, on average, families will be worse off under universal credit, include places that unexpectedly voted for the government at the last election such as Blackpool, Middlesbrough, Redcar, Hyndburn and Wolverhampton. After its victory, the government promised to regenerate fragile post-industrial economies in the Midlands, the north and north-east of England where it won a swath of previously staunch Labour-voting parliamentary seats known as the \u201cred wall\u201d. Other areas where families are on average likely to be worse off when they move on to universal credit include Liverpool, Birmingham, Glasgow, Burnley, Kingston-upon-Hull, Blaenau Gwent, Knowsley and Hartlepool. Universal credit will pay out more than \u00a360bn a year nationally by 2023. That many of the UK\u2019s poorest local areas will be net average losers under universal credit is \u201csomething currently being ignored amid growing debates about how to level up economic outcomes across Britain\u201d, says the foundation. Laura Gardiner, research director at Resolution, said some areas of the country would fare particularly badly under universal credit and understanding that \u201cshould be central to policy debates that are rightly focusing on what can be done to close economic gaps between parts of the UK\u201d. The foundation also called for further changes to the design and generosity of universal credit to make the system easier for claimants to use and to ensure it meets its original aims of simplifying benefits, improving incentives to move into work and cutting poverty. \u201cWith the reputation of universal credit under significant threat, now is the time for the government and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to really understand how it is working on the ground in order to make necessary changes,\u201d it says. While overall UK benefit spending will be maintained under universal credit, this masks a \u201csubstantial redistribution\u201d of support between different areas of the country, says Resolution, with resources skewed towards families in high-rent areas like London and the south-east over the north and Midlands. The thinktank illustrates this by highlighting the effect on Liverpool and its surrounding boroughs, where 52% of all claimants will be worse off on universal credit by 2024, compared with a national average of 46%. This rises to 65% for Merseyside families with a disabled member (60% UK-wide). On average, Merseyside families will lose \u00a37 a week. With the return of a Tory government, the foundation concludes that universal credit, despite its turbulent history, is now \u201cdefinitely going ahead\u201d. Labour had promised a root-and-branch overhaul of what it had called a \u201ccruel and inhuman\u201d system. The foundation warns ministers against complacency, saying that universal credit remained a \u201cnegative symbol\u201d of a decade of conservative welfare reform and that some of its central features \u2013 like the controversial minimum five-week wait for an initial payment \u2013 remained intensely disliked by claimants. Its qualitative research with claimants in Liverpool \u2013 supported financially by Liverpool city region \u2013 found that despite official insistence, there was no evidence that claimants believed that digitally administered benefits under universal credit were an improvement on the old system. Responding to the report, a DWP spokesperson said: \u201cUniversal credit supports more than 2.7 million people across every part of the country, introducing tailored support to replace a complicated old system. This report rightly recognises improvements we\u2019ve made, like boosting work allowances for some families to \u00a31,000 and making it much easier to apply online.\u201d Universal credit, which rolls six working-age benefits into a single monthly payment, was initially due to be fully rolled out in 2017, but a series of blunders means it will not be completed until at least 2023, by which time approximately 6 million families will have been signed up. Ministers originally argued the new system would reduce poverty by improving incentives for people to work. But Gardiner said the \u201cjury was still out\u201d on this as wider benefit cuts such as the benefit freeze and the two-child limit, which apply to people on universal credit, were likely to push up poverty rates.",

In a survey, the IoD found that directors are holding back on investment in business because of the continued uncertainty over Brexit. \u201cTo give businesses any chance of being ready for the new relationship by the end of 2020, the government needs to be as clear as possible about what its intended destination is,\u201d Allie Renison, the IoD\u2019s head of Europe and trade policy, said. \u201cWith directors clear that negotiations with the EU are the priority right now, clarity is crucial for so many companies.\u201d The IoD found that while businesses welcomed the certainty given by the withdrawal agreement struck by the prime minister in October, it was not enough to unlock investment and planning decisions. More than half of 952 directors surveyed (55%) said they would only be able to \u201cmake planning and investment decisions\u201d with certainty when \u201cwe understand our future with the EU\u201d. More than 60% of businesses said the EU deal was \u201cmore important\u201d to their business than a US deal with just 20% agreeing a deal with the US and other non-EU countries was \u201cimportant\u201d to their businesses. The survey underlines the continued anxiety in the business sector over the future relationship with the EU. On Saturday Sajid Javid raised alarm bells when he warned that the UK would not be \u201caligned\u201d with EU rules after the trade talks, sparking fears of trade barriers where none currently exist. Business leaders warned this could lead to unwelcome friction on cross-border trade with consequences for investment, jobs and the economy. The IoD is now pressing the government to publish its negotiating goals urgently. Brussels expects to publish draft negotiating guidelines on 1 February with its goals agreed among member states at a meeting on 25 February. The commission is currently holding a series of seminars in Brussels with member state representatives on its goals in areas including fisheries, energy, transport and law enforcement. The future mobility of EU citizens was discussed on Monday while space, the European defence fund, cyber security were the topics on Friday. The prime minister is expected to set out his hopes in a major speech in the first half of February but so far there has been little to no parallel consultation with business to mirror what is going on in Brussels. European commission spokesman Eric Mamer warned on Monday that it could be March before formal talks can begin. \u201cWe have said we will start negotiations as quickly as we can, but it will certainly not be before the end of February, beginning of March,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a slowing down or speeding up of the process. \u201cThis is simply the nature of the institutional process and the consultations that need to take place before the negotiation directives can be formally adopted.\u201d Renison added: \u201cAvoiding the chaotic uncertainty of leaving the EU without a deal is clearly a relief to business leaders, but they are still much more inclined to feel this Brexit deal on its own doesn\u2019t provide the certainty they need to invest and make plans for the future. \u201cOnly clarity on the next phase of Brexit talks on trade and the wider economic relationship with the EU will resolve that uncertainty, particularly for Northern Ireland and trade within the UK itself.\u201d",

Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, has called for a \u201cmajor overhaul\u201d of the policy of separating children in young offender institutions (HMYOIs). He said this in effect amounted to them being held in \u201charmful solitary confinement with little human contact and in conditions which risk damaging their mental health\u201d. He called for an entirely new approach after his report found fundamental flaws in the use of separation at the five establishments in England and Wales, which hold about 600 offenders aged 15-18. About one in 10 young offenders spoken to by inspectors had been separated during their time in custody and \u201cin the worst cases children left their cells for just 15 minutes a day\u201d. In one case, a child in crisis was \u201cleft to lie on a mattress on the floor of a filthy cell for more than 22 hours a day with no meaningful contact\u201d, the report says. Responding to the findings, Anne Longfield, the children\u2019s commissioner for England, told the Guardian: \u201cThis report paints a grim picture of the treatment of some of the most vulnerable children in YOIs.

      "bodyText": "Convicted terrorists will face lie-detector tests under a raft of measures drawn up in the wake of the most recent London Bridge attack to toughen up the monitoring of offenders in the community. The number of counter-terrorism specialist probation officers will double and they will work to a set of updated national standards for managing terrorists on licence, with closer monitoring and reporting requirements including polygraph tests, the Home Office and Ministry of Justice said in a joint announcement. Polygraphs, commonly known as lie-detector tests, remain inadmissible in UK courts but their use within the probation service for monitoring offenders is increasing. Sex offenders and domestic abuse perpetrators are already subject to the technology, and failures to pass a test can lead to further investigation or supervision. The government is to launch an independent review of the way different agencies including the police, the probation service and the security services investigate, monitor and manage terrorist offenders \u2013 a process known as Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (Mappa). The review will be led by Jonathan Hall QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist who was out on licence when he murdered two people in Fishmongers\u2019 Hall, in central London, last month before trying to flee across London Bridge where he was shot dead, was subject to Mappa for his previous offending. The atrocity, which happened in the midst of the general election campaign, led to renewed debate over the impact of austerity on the probation service, which has been crippled by cuts to budgets and staff numbers over the past decade. A counter-terrorism bill to be unveiled within the first 100 days of the new government will end automatic release on licence for terrorist offenders who receive extended determinate sentences and will introduce a mandatory minimum of 14 years in prison for those convicted of preparing acts of terrorism or directing a terrorist organisation. Khan\u2019s attack triggered calls for an overhaul of sentencing regimes for terrorist offenders. The father of Jack Merritt, one of the two people killed, accused politicians of capitalising on his son\u2019s death. The government will also increase the number of specialist psychologists and specially trained imams in prisons and probation who assess the risk of radicalised offenders. Counter-terrorism policing will increase by \u00a390m to \u00a3906m in 2020-21, the Home Office announced, while the Victims of Terrorism Unit will receive an additional \u00a3500,000 in funding. Critics said the overhaul was too little, too late. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said: \u201cAfter 10 years in government, a major overhaul now is actually an admission of failure. Major terrorist outrages have occurred all too frequently, including attacks by perpetrators who were known to the security services. \u201cThe fight against terrorism has been undermined by cuts to policing, including community policing, a lack of effective coordination between police and security services as well as the flawed Prevent programme. All of these need to change if we are going to improve the safety of our citizens.\u201d Khan is understood to have been cooperating with the probation service, which is why he was allowed to travel to London to attend the rehabilitation event at which he launched his frenzied attack. The chief inspector of probation alluded last week to a lack of \u201cprofessional curiosity\u201d among inexperienced probation officers who were unable to spot signs of \u201cfalse compliance\u201d \u2013 an industry term for offenders who cooperate with their licence terms in an attempt to conceal their true intentions.
