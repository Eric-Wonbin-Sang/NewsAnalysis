      "body": "<p>The shock death of Caroline Flack left many wondering what would be next for the Love Island villa. This year\u2019s contestants are one week away from the end of the first ever winter edition of the hit reality contest and two broadcasts \u2013 Saturday\u2019s Unseen Bits and Sunday\u2019s main show \u2013 had already been halted.</p> \n<p>While ITV are yet to confirm whether this year\u2019s Islanders had been informed about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/16/caroline-flack-obituary\">death of the show\u2019s former presenter</a> on Saturday, they released a statement on Monday saying that a tribute to Flack would air during Monday\u2019s episode. The broadcaster also added that they and their sponsor \u2013 the food delivery company Just Eat \u2013 had worked with the Samaritans to replace the show\u2019s idents with information on mental health support.</p> \n<p>Despite these adjustments, prior to broadcast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/17/no-10-calls-on-social-media-firms-to-act-after-caroline-flack-death\">it remained unclear exactly how ITV would handle</a> Flack\u2019s death while also returning to the often drama-fuelled villa. Tensions often run high and now-eliminated contestant Shaughna Phillips had already been shown under visible mental strain in the past few weeks. Even if ITV acknowledged Flack\u2019s suicide, the fourth associated with the series, was it not a message that would be totally incompatible with the mood of their most popular reality show, which can jolt unexpectedly from flippancy to heartache?</p> \n<p>The programme began not with a montage of Flack\u2019s \u2018best bits\u2019, as many viewers had expected. Rather, in a sombre voiceover accompanied by footage of lapping waves, Iain Stirling, the show\u2019s narrator, declared that the Love Island team were \u201cabsolutely devastated\u201d by Flack\u2019s death. He went on to praise the presenter\u2019s \u201cpassion, warmth and infectious enthusiasm\u201d, before imploring viewers to \u201cbe kinder, always show love and listen to one another\u201d. Far from his usual sardonic commentary, Stirling\u2019s voice cracked as he delivered the final line of the tribute: \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, Caz\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/16/caroline-flack-death-turns-spotlight-on-tabloids-once-again\">\u2018We\u2019ve had enough\u2019: Caroline Flack\u2019s death turns spotlight on tabloids once again</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It felt somewhat strange, then, to segue from this tribute straight into the episode, with footage seemingly intended for Sunday\u2019s show and presumably filmed on Friday (the Islanders have the day off each Saturday). However, the producers had clearly tempered the mood to fit with the circumstances; a game where the Islanders\u2019 had to answer provocative questions, among them\u201cwhich couple is the laziest\u201d, was edited into a largely frivolous section, with far more laughter and less backbiting than one might expect.

      "bodyText": "The shock death of Caroline Flack left many wondering what would be next for the Love Island villa. This year\u2019s contestants are one week away from the end of the first ever winter edition of the hit reality contest and two broadcasts \u2013 Saturday\u2019s Unseen Bits and Sunday\u2019s main show \u2013 had already been halted. While ITV are yet to confirm whether this year\u2019s Islanders had been informed about the death of the show\u2019s former presenter on Saturday, they released a statement on Monday saying that a tribute to Flack would air during Monday\u2019s episode. The broadcaster also added that they and their sponsor \u2013 the food delivery company Just Eat \u2013 had worked with the Samaritans to replace the show\u2019s idents with information on mental health support. Despite these adjustments, prior to broadcast it remained unclear exactly how ITV would handle Flack\u2019s death while also returning to the often drama-fuelled villa. Tensions often run high and now-eliminated contestant Shaughna Phillips had already been shown under visible mental strain in the past few weeks. Even if ITV acknowledged Flack\u2019s suicide, the fourth associated with the series, was it not a message that would be totally incompatible with the mood of their most popular reality show, which can jolt unexpectedly from flippancy to heartache? The programme began not with a montage of Flack\u2019s \u2018best bits\u2019, as many viewers had expected. Rather, in a sombre voiceover accompanied by footage of lapping waves, Iain Stirling, the show\u2019s narrator, declared that the Love Island team were \u201cabsolutely devastated\u201d by Flack\u2019s death. He went on to praise the presenter\u2019s \u201cpassion, warmth and infectious enthusiasm\u201d, before imploring viewers to \u201cbe kinder, always show love and listen to one another\u201d. Far from his usual sardonic commentary, Stirling\u2019s voice cracked as he delivered the final line of the tribute: \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, Caz\u201d. It felt somewhat strange, then, to segue from this tribute straight into the episode, with footage seemingly intended for Sunday\u2019s show and presumably filmed on Friday (the Islanders have the day off each Saturday). However, the producers had clearly tempered the mood to fit with the circumstances; a game where the Islanders\u2019 had to answer provocative questions, among them\u201cwhich couple is the laziest\u201d, was edited into a largely frivolous section, with far more laughter and less backbiting than one might expect. Stirling, clearly grieving his colleague, did not provide his usual dry, witty asides, instead providing more of a functional audio description than a narration. Until the final scene \u2013 where couples had to choose two other pairs to send home \u2013 the entire show felt both strangely light-hearted and unusually subdued, an uncanny version of its usual self. Whether ITV had done what they chose to and air the show in an altered form, or pay tribute to Flack in a more extensive way before bringing the show back later in the week, they were bound to strike the wrong tone for some viewers. While some online found the contrast between the #bekind idents and the programme itself jarring, many praised the channel for finding a way to continue the series while also referencing the wider context of social media trolling and media harassment which contributed to its former presenter\u2019s death.

      "body": "<p>More than 600 Amazon workers have been seriously injured or narrowly escaped an accident in the past three years, prompting calls for a parliamentary inquiry into safety at the online retailer\u2019s vast UK warehouses.</p> <p>Amazon, whose largest shareholder is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/26/jeff-bezos-philanthropy-donations-top-50\">world\u2019s richest man Jeff Bezos</a>, recently launched an advertising campaign fronted by contented staff members, after a string of embarrassing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/05/amazon-workers-protest-unsafe-grueling-conditions-warehouse\">revelations about working conditions</a>.</p> <p>But new figures obtained by the GMB trade union under the Freedom of Information Act suggest safety at its more than 50 UK warehouses has not improved, and may be worsening.</p> <p> Local authorities have received 622 accident reports involving Amazon warehouses over the past three years. The annual total has risen from 152 in 2016-17 to 230 the following year and 240 last year.</p> <p>In one case, a self-employed contractor at a London warehouse lost consciousness and appeared to stop breathing following a head injury, having attempted to restart work.</p> <p>The accident investigation report found that sorting baskets had been overfilled and that \u201cthe main root cause of this incident was failing to provide a safe working environment\u201d.</p> <p>A report covering an incident in 2015, before the period covered by the figures, concluded that a lapse of concentration due to \u201clong working hours\u201d was behind an incident in which a forklift truck driver reversed into a steel structure, bringing some of it down.</p> <p>Internal emails from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) show that the accident was reported by an Amazon worker who would not give their name because they were \u201cworried about getting sacked\u201d.</p> <p>Lisa Nandy, the MP for Wigan and a Labour leadership contender, called for an investigation into Amazon. She said: \u201cThe warehouse injuries suffered by Amazon workers are beyond appalling. I stand ready, if and when Amazon\u2019s workers take strike action and protest, I will be there with them.</p> <p>\u201cThe Tories need to start taking workers\u2019 rights seriously and standing up to businesses like Amazon. I call on an urgent investigation \u2013 workers simply cannot wait for their conditions to improve.\u201d</p> <p>Jack Dromey, MP for Birmingham Erdington, said: \u201cIn my 30 years in the world of work I cannot remember any company clock up so many injuries to its workers.</p> <p>\u201cI have been inside the giant Rugeley depot and heard first-hand from frightened workers of the 77 serious incidents in Rugeley alone.</p> <p>\u201cAmazon purports to be a 21st century company. It behaves like a 19th century mill-owner. [Its] owner, the American billionaire, Jeff Bezos, should be called to account by parliament for his actions.</p> <p>\u201cHow can he or Amazon justify refusing to talk to their workers\u2019 union, the GMB, on safety? Their behaviour is disgraceful.\u201d</p> <p>The GMB said the escalation in the number of accidents and near-misses demonstrated the need for parliament to investigate the online retailer.</p> <p>Mick Rix, GMB national officer, said: \u201cAmazon are spending millions on PR campaigns trying to persuade people its warehouses are great places to work. But the facts are there for all to see \u2013 things are getting worse.</p> <p>\u201cHundreds of stricken Amazon workers are needing urgent medical attention. Conditions are hellish.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried over and over again to get Amazon to talk to us to try and improve safety for workers. But enough is enough \u2013 it\u2019s now time for a full parliamentary inquiry.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon became the second company in the world to be valued by Wall Street at $1tn, while its founder Jeff Bezos is the world\u2019s richest man with an estimated net worth of $137bn (\u00a3104bn).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the company has been dogged by allegations that its success is founded on the backs of workers enduring poor safety and low pay, leading to claims that Scottish staff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/11/amazon-accused-of-intolerable-conditions-at-scottish-warehouse\">resorted to living in tents</a> to cut commuting costs.</p> <p>Bezos is paying $165m for a house in the exclusive Beverly Hills area of Los Angeles, according to the Wall Street Journal, more than Amazon is due to pay in US federal taxes in 2019.</p> <p>An Amazon spokesman said: \u201cAmazon is a safe place to work. Yet again, our critics seem determined to paint a false picture of what it\u2019s like to work for Amazon. They repeat the same sensationalised allegations time and time again.</p> <p>\u201cOur doors are open to the public, to politicians, and indeed to anyone who truly wants to see the modern, innovate and, most importantly, safe environment we provide to our people. The fact is we benchmark against UK national data, published by the Health &amp; Safety Executive, confirming we have over 40% fewer injuries on average than other transportation and warehousing businesses in the UK.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than 600 Amazon workers have been seriously injured or narrowly escaped an accident in the past three years, prompting calls for a parliamentary inquiry into safety at the online retailer\u2019s vast UK warehouses. Amazon, whose largest shareholder is the world\u2019s richest man Jeff Bezos, recently launched an advertising campaign fronted by contented staff members, after a string of embarrassing revelations about working conditions. But new figures obtained by the GMB trade union under the Freedom of Information Act suggest safety at its more than 50 UK warehouses has not improved, and may be worsening. Local authorities have received 622 accident reports involving Amazon warehouses over the past three years. The annual total has risen from 152 in 2016-17 to 230 the following year and 240 last year. In one case, a self-employed contractor at a London warehouse lost consciousness and appeared to stop breathing following a head injury, having attempted to restart work. The accident investigation report found that sorting baskets had been overfilled and that \u201cthe main root cause of this incident was failing to provide a safe working environment\u201d. A report covering an incident in 2015, before the period covered by the figures, concluded that a lapse of concentration due to \u201clong working hours\u201d was behind an incident in which a forklift truck driver reversed into a steel structure, bringing some of it down. Internal emails from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) show that the accident was reported by an Amazon worker who would not give their name because they were \u201cworried about getting sacked\u201d. Lisa Nandy, the MP for Wigan and a Labour leadership contender, called for an investigation into Amazon. She said: \u201cThe warehouse injuries suffered by Amazon workers are beyond appalling. I stand ready, if and when Amazon\u2019s workers take strike action and protest, I will be there with them. \u201cThe Tories need to start taking workers\u2019 rights seriously and standing up to businesses like Amazon. I call on an urgent investigation \u2013 workers simply cannot wait for their conditions to improve.\u201d Jack Dromey, MP for Birmingham Erdington, said: \u201cIn my 30 years in the world of work I cannot remember any company clock up so many injuries to its workers. \u201cI have been inside the giant Rugeley depot and heard first-hand from frightened workers of the 77 serious incidents in Rugeley alone. \u201cAmazon purports to be a 21st century company. It behaves like a 19th century mill-owner. [Its] owner, the American billionaire, Jeff Bezos, should be called to account by parliament for his actions. \u201cHow can he or Amazon justify refusing to talk to their workers\u2019 union, the GMB, on safety? Their behaviour is disgraceful.\u201d The GMB said the escalation in the number of accidents and near-misses demonstrated the need for parliament to investigate the online retailer. Mick Rix, GMB national officer, said: \u201cAmazon are spending millions on PR campaigns trying to persuade people its warehouses are great places to work. But the facts are there for all to see \u2013 things are getting worse. \u201cHundreds of stricken Amazon workers are needing urgent medical attention. Conditions are hellish. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried over and over again to get Amazon to talk to us to try and improve safety for workers. But enough is enough \u2013 it\u2019s now time for a full parliamentary inquiry.\u201d Amazon became the second company in the world to be valued by Wall Street at $1tn, while its founder Jeff Bezos is the world\u2019s richest man with an estimated net worth of $137bn (\u00a3104bn). But the company has been dogged by allegations that its success is founded on the backs of workers enduring poor safety and low pay, leading to claims that Scottish staff resorted to living in tents to cut commuting costs. Bezos is paying $165m for a house in the exclusive Beverly Hills area of Los Angeles, according to the Wall Street Journal, more than Amazon is due to pay in US federal taxes in 2019. An Amazon spokesman said: \u201cAmazon is a safe place to work. Yet again, our critics seem determined to paint a false picture of what it\u2019s like to work for Amazon. They repeat the same sensationalised allegations time and time again. \u201cOur doors are open to the public, to politicians, and indeed to anyone who truly wants to see the modern, innovate and, most importantly, safe environment we provide to our people. The fact is we benchmark against UK national data, published by the Health &amp; Safety Executive, confirming we have over 40% fewer injuries on average than other transportation and warehousing businesses in the UK.\u201d",

The Ode brought emphatic, communicative singing from the chorus and a quartet of soloists including baritone Florian Boesch and tenor Robert Murray; it ended in a jubilant blaze, but the most striking moment had come with the very first entry of the theme, on cellos and basses, which Rattle held to such a hush that it seemed to be coming from beyond some far horizon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.iwonasobotka.com/\">Iwona Sobotka</a>, who soared through the Beethoven solo soprano lines, had in the first half been the soloist in Berg\u2019s Lulu Suite, her tone luscious, her highest notes teetering on the edge of vulnerability. From the opening moments, glowing with longing and tenderness, to the way the strings dug deep for the elegiac final movement, the orchestra\u2019s performance was one of heightened colour and feverish energy \u2013 an unlikely springboard for the Beethoven, but in context an effective one.</p>",

The Ode brought emphatic, communicative singing from the chorus and a quartet of soloists including baritone Florian Boesch and tenor Robert Murray; it ended in a jubilant blaze, but the most striking moment had come with the very first entry of the theme, on cellos and basses, which Rattle held to such a hush that it seemed to be coming from beyond some far horizon. Iwona Sobotka, who soared through the Beethoven solo soprano lines, had in the first half been the soloist in Berg\u2019s Lulu Suite, her tone luscious, her highest notes teetering on the edge of vulnerability. From the opening moments, glowing with longing and tenderness, to the way the strings dug deep for the elegiac final movement, the orchestra\u2019s performance was one of heightened colour and feverish energy \u2013 an unlikely springboard for the Beethoven, but in context an effective one.",

And now he\u2019s being asked to play as a proper centre forward rather than a wide attacking player coming in from the left, where he played most of his games before this season. True, that\u2019s where he says he wants to play, but it still takes a while to really develop in a new-ish position, as shown by the way Henry was far from the deadly striker he became when first arriving at Arsenal.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s true, but Henry had pretty much cracked it after three or four months, and he was a couple of years younger. Martial has the ability and intelligence to improve as a centre-forward - tonight\u2019s goal is an example of that - but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll ever have the attitude or temperament to be a great player.

It\u2019s a pretty big game, this, in the race for fourth/fifth/whichever place will ensure a share of next season\u2019s Champions League coin. </p> <p>Chelsea are fourth at the moment, a point ahead of Spurs in fifth and six ahead of United in ninth, but their home form has been dodgy for most of the season. Southampton are the only other Premier League team to have picked up more points away than at home, and Chelsea failed to beat 10-man Arsenal in their last game at Stamford Bridge. What started as a slight tactical problem is in danger of becoming a mental block. This would be a very good time to get over it: in the next nine days they host Manchester United, Spurs and Bayern Munich.</p> <p>Manchester United\u2019s away form isn\u2019t exactly tickety-boo, either. They have managed 12 points and 12 goals in 12 league games, which is admirably symmetrical but a little incongruous for a team whose main/only strength is counter-attacking. But they have also won twice at the Etihad, drew away to Liverpool at Old Trafford and beat Chelsea here in the Carabao Cup.<br></p> <p>Marcus Rashford scored both goals that night. Since his injury United have scored precisely no goals in three league games. (Yes, they did beat Tranmere 6-0 in the FA Cup, but why don\u2019t you behave yourself.) The new signings Bruno Fernandes and Odion Ighalo will hope to change that.</p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 8pm GMT.</strong><br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-17T19:11:39.485Z\">at 7.11pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Lampard wanted Maguire sent off ... Jonathan Liew on Bruno Fernandes ... That\u2019s all for me - I\u2019ll leave you with Jacob Steinberg\u2019s report from Samford Bridge. Night! Peep peep! That\u2019s an excellent victory for Manchester United, who have beaten Chelsea three times this season by a combined score of 8-1. Anthony Martial and Harry Maguire scored superb headers, although the post-match talk will doubtless be about VARZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. Chelsea had two goals disallowed, while Maguire should have been sent off in the first half for studding Michy Batshuayi in a very personal space. 90+3 min: Ighalo misses a great chance to score! Fred put him through with a nice short pass, and Ighalo poked an instinctive shot that was blocked by the outrushing Caballero. He probably should have scored. 90+2 min Diogo Dalot replaces Bruno Fernandes, who had another encouraging game and made the second goal. 90+1 min Odion Ighalo comes on to make his Manchester United debut in place of Anthony Martial, who scored a lovely opening goal. There will be five added minutes. 90 min \u201cIf you look back at the moment they froze the play for the VAR on Giroud\u2019s goal (the first shot showing the cross), that blurry thing representing the ball was well on its way off the foot of the crosser,\u201d says Mike Greville. \u201cJust too late. Just saying. He probably was not offside when the ball was struck. Cue indignation at \u2018factual\u2019 decisions.\u201d Yes, I\u2019ve thought this all along \u2013 I don\u2019t trust the accuracy at all, especially not when there are so many moving parts. 89 min Mount hits the post with an ingenious free-kick! Everyone expected a cross from an inside-right position, but Mount hammered it low and hard towards the near post. De Gea scrambled across and hit the post himself, just after the ball. He looks groggy and needs treatment. 88 min A Chelsea corner pinballs around the area. Eventually Reece James\u2019s low shot is deflected behind for another corner. This one is headed away by Bailly. 87 min I\u2019m not the biggest fan of Luke Shaw but he\u2019s had a really good game as the left-sided centre-back. 85 min A win would take United up to seventh, three points behind Chelsea in fourth. The game is petering out; all connected with Chelsea look thoroughly VARed off. 84 min \u201cHaha lolz Varchestvar Varnited?!\u201d says Niall Mullen. 83 min Azpilicueta looks like he wants to hurt someone. His head went about 20 minutes ago. 82 min \u201cDo you think if the refs took the rule from rugby - any backchat about decisions and the decision reverses or it goes forward by 10 yards - would work in football?\u201d asks Ruth Purdue. \u201cTaylor is getting a lot of abuse for every call, as per usual.\u201d Didn\u2019t they try that in the early 2000s? Everyone just ignored it and it was scrapped after a few years. 80 min A Manchester United change: Andreas Pereira replaces Daniel James. 79 min Wan-Bissaka is booked for an altercation with Azpilicueta. I\u2019m not sure why only one of them was booked, but anyway. Oh dear. It was a superb diving header from Giroud, but his foot was fractionally offside. Olivier Giroud brings Chelsea back into the game with a lovely goal (VAR permitting). 76 min Williams is booked for a foul on Willian. 75 min Fernandes goes down holding his face after wearing a straight arm from Giroud. Welcome to England! Kovacic is also struggling, and Chelsea have used all three subs. 73 min A lovely flick from Giroud finds Kovacic, who scoots into the area and looks certain to score until Bailly appears from nowhere to make a spectacular block. That was brilliant defending. 71 min Fernandes\u2019s set-pieces have been good tonight. He hits them with so much pace. 70 min Maguire\u2019s dangerous header across goal, from Fernandes\u2019s booming free-kick, is nutted behind by Azpilicueta. Martial was waiting behind him to score. 68 min Olivier Giroud replaces Michy Batshuayi, who had a bit of a nightmare. 68 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Bobby Moore. \u201cOne of football\u2019s great delights is watching two of your rivals kick each other to bits. Throw in floodlights, some VAR shenanigans, and a can or two, and you\u2019ve got yourself a lovely evening.\u201d Here\u2019s some post-match entertainment for you. It was made by Bruno Fernandes, who bulleted a corner from the left towards the penalty spot. Maguire arrived late, got in front of Rudiger and planted an emphatic downward header into the net. He shouldn\u2019t be on the field, but that was a brilliant header. Harry Maguire doubles United\u2019s lead with a superb header! 64 min ... and Fernandes whips it off the post! It was a superb effort, curled around the wall, and it thumped off the bottom of the near post. Caballero may have it covered but it was a lovely strike. 64 min The free-kick is almost on the right edge of the area. Fred and Fernandes are over it... 63 min Pedro dithers on the edge of his own area, is robbed by Fred and pulls him down. It was definitely outside the area. 60 min The ever impressive Reece James wins a corner for Chelsea. Nothing comes on this one. 58 min Zouma leads with his studs while tackling Martial, who goes over in a heap. Fred then gets involved and is booked, as is Zouma for the original tackle. 56 min Azpilicueta definitely pushed Williams. But there\u2019s a good argument that Fred eased Azpilicueta into Williams in the first place. It could have gone either way, but when you add it to the Maguire incident Chelsea have good reason to be hacked off. Zouma volleyed a right-wing corner smartly into the net. But the goal has been disallowed for a push by Azpilicueta on Williams. Kurt Zouma equalises from a corner! It\u2019s going to be checked by VAR though. 54 min Mount\u2019s shot is pushed onto the post by de Gea, though the whistle had gone for handball by Batshuayi. 51 min Bailly, who has had a very encouraging game on his return, steps in to win the ball and start another United attack. Eventually Shaw overruns the ball and is dispossessed by Pedro. 50 min \u201cDoes Martial deserve a bit more patience to develop into a really consistent centre forward?\u201d says David Wall. \u201cHe\u2019s still relatively young and although he has been at United a while now he seemed pretty much ostracised during the last year or so of Mourinho\u2019s time there (in spirit if not in body, never getting a consistent run after Sanchez arrived). And now he\u2019s being asked to play as a proper centre forward rather than a wide attacking player coming in from the left, where he played most of his games before this season. True, that\u2019s where he says he wants to play, but it still takes a while to really develop in a new-ish position, as shown by the way Henry was far from the deadly striker he became when first arriving at Arsenal.\u201d That\u2019s true, but Henry had pretty much cracked it after three or four months, and he was a couple of years younger. Martial has the ability and intelligence to improve as a centre-forward - tonight\u2019s goal is an example of that - but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll ever have the attitude or temperament to be a great player. That said, United are not really in a position to sell players like Martial. 47 min Rudiger is booked for a cynical foul on Fernandes. 46 min Chelsea begin the second half. Christensen is being checked for concussion, which makes you wonder why he was allowed back on the field. I have no idea how these things work. Chelsea have made a half-time substitution, with Kurt Zouma on for the injured Andreas Christensen. The replays of the Maguire incident suggest he was exceedingly lucky to avoid a red card. At first I thought you could at least argue it was a reflex action, but the replays are pretty damning. He studded Batshuayi in the business area! Half-time reading Peep peep! Manchester United lead through Anthony Martial\u2019s classy header. It\u2019s been a slightly odd game - full of enthusiasm and good intentions but without much quality in the final third. Martial\u2019s goal was the only shot on target from either side. See you in 15 minutes for the second half. 45+4 min Batshuayi misses another chance, driving tamely wide of the far post after a good through pass from Pedro. It was a pretty tight angle, in his defence, but the shot was painfully lacking in conviction. 45+1 min That was the first shot on target in the match. That\u2019s another one for Martial\u2019s YouTube compilation. Wan-Bissaka made the goal, twisting Willian one way and then the other before crossing to the near post. Martial got above Christensen, who had just come back on the field, and flicked an accomplished header into the far corner. Nobody ever doubted his class, and that was another demonstration. Anthony Martial gives United the lead with a masterful finish. 44 min There\u2019s a break in play while Christensen receives treatment for a bloody nose. He\u2019ll be fine. 41 min There\u2019s another example. Chelsea move the ball smoothly from right to left, only for the overlaaping Azpilicueta to hit his cross straight at Wan-Bissaka. 39 min This match has flattered to deceive. There have been lots of promising attacks from both teams, and precisely no shots on target. Abraham and Rashford are having good games. 37 min A half chance for Martial. He played a nice one-two with Fernandes on the left, moved into the area and drove a low, left-footed shot that went a few yards wide of the far post. 36 min It was just outside the area, so VAR can\u2019t get involved. Replays suggest it was a clear foul. 35 min Willian is booked for diving. I thought he was fouled by Fernandes, right on the edge of - and possibly inside - the area. This will be checked. 33 min \u201cTo me, Martial is a YouTube great in the making,\u201d says Vibanshu Bisht. \u201cAs in, 10 years down the line, his 10 min highlights clip would make great viewing, making United fans who never saw him play 90 minutes think he was the greatest. A bit like what Berbatov is now.\u201d That\u2019s a really good comparison, certainly in terms of temperament and flattery to deceive. Unlike Berbatov, though, I can\u2019t imagine Martial in Eyes Wide Shut. 31 min A corner is cleared to Bruno Fernandes, who rakes a shot well wide from 30 yards. 31 min Williams surges down the left and plays a dangerous low cross towards James that is kicked behind by Kovacic. There still hasn\u2019t been a shot on target. 30 min \u201cI do like Luke Shaw and I do feel that Mourinho broke him really as a player,\u201d says Rachel Clifton. \u201cBut he does always look a touch like someone woke him up three minutes before kick-off.\u201d I\u2019ve never understood the fuss about Shaw, really. He\u2019s in terrible shape and I\u2019ve never seen much evidence that he is anything more than a decent full-back. 28 min \u201cIf Chelsea do not win, Liverpool will have qualified for the Champions League even if City are reinstated,\u201d writes my colleague Philip Cornwall. \u201cIt would be impossible for both Chelsea and Spurs to finish ahead of the leaders, given they meet on Saturday. Both would kick off needing to win all their final 12 games to match or overhaul Liverpool\u2019s 76 points, if that game kicks off with Spurs on 40 and Chelsea on 41 or 42 - and only one of them can win that match.\u201d Yes, but what have they actually won? 26 min Batshuayi misses a sitter! It was beautifully set up: Pedro slid a penetrative pass down the inside-left channel to Mount, who looked up and picked out Batshuayi with a precise cutback pass. He made a mess of a simple chance, steering just wide from 12 yards with his left foot. 24 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cAs a seasoned United watcher can you tell me is Martial really good or just alright? Everything about him screams elite attacking player but his record is unspectacular. He\u2019s also 24 now so he should be approaching his peak years.\u201d He\u2019s the kind of player you\u2019d be scared to sell, because he could be a superstar, but I suspect he\u2019ll always be a bit too easygoing to fulfil his potential. It\u2019d be interesting to see what he\u2019d be like under a great man-manager/motivator like Klopp. 23 min Chelsea miss a good opportunity when Willian\u2019s cutback is just behind Batshuayi on the six-yard line. A better ball would have given him an open goal. 22 min Maguire survives a VAR check for a red card. He was pushed over by Batshuayi, and fell into the Chelsea dugout. As he did so he left his legs in the air and ended up gently studding Batshuayi in the thigh. It\u2019s hard to be certain of intent, I suppose, but I\u2019m pretty sure he knew what he was doing. 21 min A promising break from United ends when Martial whacks a shot that is blocked by Rudiger. 18 min Pedro pulls Wan-Bissaka over, gets away with it and hits a dangerous low cross that is cleared by Shaw. 16 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Stephen Carr. \u201cQuite a lot of pointless running about isn\u2019t there?\u201d Hang on, how did you get into the office? 13 min Mason Mount replaces Kante. 12 min Fernandes and Fred combine really nicely on the edge of the area before Fred\u2019s drive is blocked by Rudiger. 11 min Kante walks off slowly - \u201cnot the most sorry sight if you\u2019re a Manchester United fan,\u201d says Gary Neville on Sky - and will be replaced as soon as Mason Mount is ready. 10 min Kante is receiving treatment, and it doesn\u2019t look good. He\u2019s not in any obvious pain but it looks like a muscle problem and I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to continue. 8 min It\u2019s been a breezy, attacking start to the game, with Chelsea in particular looking good. Willian runs at Williams just inside the area, makes some space with a stepover and drives a left-footed shot that goes a few yards wide of the far post. 7 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Matt Pearson. \u201cChelsea fan here. Given that both our goalkeepers teeter pretty evenly on the axis of unspectacular and gaffe-prone, do you think Frank has kept Kepa on the bench just because he knows what a nightmare it would be to try and sub him off? Or does this spell the beginning of the end for the \u00a372 million sometime-shot-stopper?\u201d I don\u2019t say this with any authority, as I\u2019m not in any of Frank Lampard\u2019s WhatsApp groups, but I suspect that at this stage it\u2019s no more or less than a kick up the trousers. From afar, it feels like Chelsea have more pressing requirements than a new goalkeeper. 6 min A fine effort from Reece James flies just wide. He controlled a cross on the chest on the edge of the area, moved the ball onto his right foot and drove a low shot that took a slight touch off Brandon Williams and rolled just wide of the far post. 4 min United are playing 3-4-1-2, as expected. Chelsea\u2019s formation is 4-3-3, also as expected, but with Pedro on the left and Willian on the right. 3 min Bailly is robbed by Pedro, spraking the first Chelsea attack. Matic ends it with a decent interception. 2 min \u201cYou once mentioned my name almost 10 years ago, when I was reading an MBM in the British Library instead of writing an essay,\u201d says Chris Ioannou. \u201cI asked politely and you accommodated. See, Rob is one of the good ones... also, have you really been writing MBMs for that long?\u201d No, you\u2019re confusing me with the other Rob Smyth. Such a shame what happened to him. 1 min Peep peep! Manchester United kick off from left to right. They are in red; Chelsea are in blue. \u201cThanks for sharing the Harry Gregg obituary,\u201d says Ryan Grubb. \u201cOne hell of a life lived there. I can only imagine how much everyone, everywhere rooted for that team in the FA Cup run in 58. Really puts our habits as modern supporters in perspective. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me I\u2019ve got some clouds to yell at.\u201d \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says John Ryan. \u201cWhat\u2019s your prediction for tonight? Can see both sides scoring.\u201d I fancy Chelsea to win fairly convincingly, maybe 2-0, although both teams are so unpredictable that anything could happen. United have looked bereft in attack without Marcus Rashford, though Bruno Fernandes should improve that side of their play. \u201cAs a Watford fan, I want to see Odion Ighalo do well (except against the Hornets on Sunday),\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cAnd as a dreadful puns fan, I want to see him named in an all-time Cinema XI: IMAXwell Emlyn Vues Odeon Ighalo Alex Roxylade-Chamberlain Alessandro Rialtobelli Roberto 3-D Matteo Pearl and Dean Holdsworth Ritz Hall Lobby Robson Savoy Hodgson Leroy San\u00e9world \u201cIf I simply say \u2018Hi Rob\u2019 to Rob Smyth, am I likely to get a mention?\u201d asks Graham Moger. \u201cWe will see... and could indicate the extent of interest, or otherwise, in tonight\u2019s game. Or simply how polite and accommodating Rob is?\u201d Oh, I\u2019m one of the good guys. This has been established over a number of years, but it never hurts to gratuitously advertise my inherent magnificence. \u201cA win for United will get them closer to magic number of 40 points and eliminate any relegation fears,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cHow the mighty have fallen.\u201d They haven\u2019t fallen that far, at least not yet. Pre-match soundtrack \u201cMan Utd drew away to Liverpool at Old Trafford?\u201d sniffs Alec Smith. They played like the away side that day. That\u2019s not a criticism; they did it brilliantly. Pre-match reading Harry Gregg died yesterday at the age 0f 87. He was a hero in ways that shame our silly modern lives, and it\u2019s telling that most tributes dwelt even more on his character than his enormous football ability. There\u2019s no recall in the Chelsea goal for Kepa Arrizabalaga, with Willy Caballero keeping his place. Tammy Abraham is injured so Michy Batshuayi starts up front. Eric Bailly plays for the first time since Manchester United\u2019s match against Chelsea at Old Trafford in April. Odion Ighalo is on the bench. Chelsea (4-3-3) Caballero; James, Christensen, Rudiger, Azpilicueta; Kante, Jorginho, Kovacic; Pedro, Batshuayi, Willian. Substitutes: Arrizabalaga, Zouma, Alonso, Tomori, Barkley, Mount, Giroud. Manchester United (3-4-1-2) de Gea; Bailly, Maguire, Shaw; Wan-Bissaka, Fred, Matic, Williams; Fernandes; James, Martial. Substitutes: Romero, Jones, Dalot, Mata, Pereira, Ighalo, Greenwood. Referee Anthony Taylor. Hello and welcome to live coverage of Roy Keane v Jamie Carr\u2026 sorry, of Chelsea v Manchester United from Stamford Bridge. It\u2019s a pretty big game, this, in the race for fourth/fifth/whichever place will ensure a share of next season\u2019s Champions League coin. Chelsea are fourth at the moment, a point ahead of Spurs in fifth and six ahead of United in ninth, but their home form has been dodgy for most of the season. Southampton are the only other Premier League team to have picked up more points away than at home, and Chelsea failed to beat 10-man Arsenal in their last game at Stamford Bridge. What started as a slight tactical problem is in danger of becoming a mental block. This would be a very good time to get over it: in the next nine days they host Manchester United, Spurs and Bayern Munich. Manchester United\u2019s away form isn\u2019t exactly tickety-boo, either. They have managed 12 points and 12 goals in 12 league games, which is admirably symmetrical but a little incongruous for a team whose main/only strength is counter-attacking. But they have also won twice at the Etihad, drew away to Liverpool at Old Trafford and beat Chelsea here in the Carabao Cup. Marcus Rashford scored both goals that night. Since his injury United have scored precisely no goals in three league games. (Yes, they did beat Tranmere 6-0 in the FA Cup, but why don\u2019t you behave yourself.) The new signings Bruno Fernandes and Odion Ighalo will hope to change that. Kick off is at 8pm GMT.",

The bigger shock would come when the federal government complained it had not been consulted before the announcement. Memories may be short in politics, but it is hard to forget how former federal treasurer Joe Hockey set events in motion when he dared General Motors to leave from the floor of Parliament. Who could have known how that would end? Now another 600 Holden workers will follow thousands of automotive workers who stepped bravely into an increasingly precarious job market, with the company said to pay up to $1bn in redundancy payouts. What future they will find remains an open question. In November last year, the AMWU released the findings of a small survey of former car workers. Though 80% reported finding other work a year out from the closure, their new jobs were part-time, casual, and on contract \u2013 all different ways of saying \u201cprecarious\u201d. An interim federal government survey would similarly find car workers were now working harder, longer and for less pay than they did before, though it tried to put a happy spin on the story. Its breakdown on non-standard work found 39% of workers at the major car makers were now precariously employed, while the same was true for 49% of those in the supply chain. Though the government has promised to release the full report, it has yet to do so. If Holden truly is a symbol, than the decision to throw the makers out of work may instead be read as a metaphor for an economy now increasingly reliant on mines and mortgages. Some of this background explains how Australia is about as complex as Senegal and Pakistan. Since 1995, Australia fell from 57th out of 133 listed economies to 93rd in 2017. The implications are profound. The lack of skills and basic infrastructure makes it harder to transition to zero carbon economy while at the individual level it means a new kind of fragility. As the social security system has been shredded and the numbers of those in full-time work has hit historic lows, those looking for a little upward social momentum are swallowed by a yawning wealth gap. If Holden was a national icon in the good times, it remains so in the bad.

Some days they disappear in seconds, but on others, when the air is already full of moisture, they join together to form cirrus clouds which can linger for up to 18 hours.

      "bodyText": "Anyone living in Britain will be familiar with the white contrails that aircraft produce as transatlantic flights cross the country. Some days they disappear in seconds, but on others, when the air is already full of moisture, they join together to form cirrus clouds which can linger for up to 18 hours. They make the sun hazy and prevent heat escaping back into space from the atmosphere, adding to climate warming. Scientists from Imperial College London calculate that these contrails add as much again to heating the atmosphere as the carbon dioxide produced by the aircraft but have found a solution. By altering the altitude of aircraft flying into humid air up or down by 2,000ft (610 metres) to reach drier layers, the formation of contrails and the resultant warming is cut by 59%.

Wine</h2> <p>Chile\u2019s varied geography - arid desert in the north, cool coastal climes washed by the Pacific, rich volcanic soils further south, and windswept steppe in the cold far south - make it a wonderland for winemakers, with a different terroir round every corner. It\u2019s also famous for being home to a long-lost grape variety, <em>carm\u00e9n\u00e8re</em>, wiped out by the vine disease phylloxera in its native France in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, then rediscovered in Chile in 1994. But there are plenty more reasons to try a tipple in Chile.</p> <p>A few highlights: <a href=\"https://www.elprincipal.cl/en/inicio/\" rel=\"nofollow\">El Principal vineyard</a> in the Alto Maipo Valley produces stellar cool-climate wines; <a href=\"https://matetic.com/visit-us/?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matetic</a> in the Rosario Valley makes excellent organic, biodynamic syrah; and <a href=\"https://www.kingstonvineyards.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingston Family Vineyards</a>\u2019 sauvignon blanc, from its Casablanca Valley winery, is crisp and fresh.

You can\u2019t leave Chile without trying the zesty, fresh cocktail. Pisco is brandy made from grapes grown in the northern desert region, and the cocktail is made by mixing it with lemon juice, sugar and egg white. It\u2019s delicious and citrusy - and deceptively strong. <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Restaurant_Review-g294305-d7161213-Reviews-Chipe_Libre_Republica_Independiente_del_Pisco-Santiago_Santiago_Metropolitan_Regi.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chipe Libre</a> in Santiago offers a vast array of Chilean piscos.

Curanto</h2> <p>The island of Chilo\u00e9 in southern Chile is thought to be the birthplace of the potato. Try <em>milcaos</em> -steamed potato cakes studded with bacon - and <em>chapaleles</em>, mashed potato dumplings. Seafood is also a staple, and <em>curanto</em> is a wonderful way to try it. A shellfish, meat, vegetable and dumpling stew, <em>curanto</em> is cooked in a hole in the ground with hot rocks.

Barbecued lamb</h2> <p>A hearty dish fit for a <em>huaso</em> (a skilled horseman and countryman, like the Chilean version of a cowboy), <em>cordero al palo</em> is classic Patagonian fare: lamb barbecued on a spit. Visit Puerto Natales, the lakeside town that\u2019s the gateway to Torres del Paine National Park, and enjoy it at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/asadorpatagoniconatales\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asador Patag\u00f3nico</a> for the real deal.

Merluza austral</h2> <p>Chile\u2019s coastline is about 4000km long - so you\u2019d expect fish dishes to make a good showing. And sometimes, the simplest recipes are the best. The most popular fish in Chile is the <em>merluza austral</em>, or southern hake, which is fished from the frigid waters off Patagonia. Fried, its firm white flesh is crispy and delicious. Try it at local favourite <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pimenton.valpo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">El Pimenton</a> in the seaside port of Valpara\u00edso.</p> <h2>11. Arrollado</h2> <p>Renowned foodie and TV presenter Anthony Bourdain declared the <em>arrollado</em> at <a href=\"https://elhoyo.cl/\" rel=\"nofollow\">El Hoyo</a> restaurant in Santiago to be his absolute favourite Chilean dish. It\u2019s a tender marinated pork loin that\u2019s rolled and sliced, and El Hoyo has been dishing it up, among other rustic delights, from its spot near Estaci\u00f3n Central since 1912. El Hoyo is one of the city\u2019s preeminent <em>picadas</em> (casual restaurants serving classic Chilean cuisine).</p> <h2>12. Caldillo de congrio</h2> <p>If the sound of eel chowder doesn\u2019t immediately strike your fancy, don\u2019t worry: in combination with spices, seasoning and vegetables, the eels create an ocean flavour that\u2019s so heavenly, Chile\u2019s national poet Pablo Neruda wrote an entire poem in praise of it.

      "bodyText": "And that closes the debate. In the context of the debate on Labour\u2019s antisemitism problem, the candidates are asked by an audience member about the rights of the Palestinian people. All three say it\u2019s perfectly possible to simultaneously avoid being antisemitic and stand up for the rights of the Palestinian people. The candidates are hearing from voters who abandoned Labour at the last election. One such tells them the next leader needs to move the party towards the centre and cites Starmer as the candidate most likely to do so. Another voter says antisemitism was the greatest factor in his view and asks for a commitment from the candidates to deal with it. Nandy calls it \u201cexistential\u201d. Starmer says any antisemite should not be in the party, adding he would make it a personal responsibility. Long-Bailey says Labour has not dealt with antisemitism properly and must \u201crebuild trust by educating our membership on this issue\u201d. The candidates are facing quick-fire questions before the final ad break. Would they decriminalise cannabis? Long-Bailey: No Starmer: No Nandy: No Would they vote to keep or discard the monarchy in a referendum? Nandy: Scrap it Starmer: Keep it, but downsize Long-Bailey: Wouldn\u2019t vote to abolish the monarchy Would they keep Labour\u2019s free broadband policy? Starmer: Refuses to give a definite answer, saying \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d is too simplistic Long-Bailey: Supports the principle but believes it needs to be better explained to voters Nandy: Calls it an important policy but says she\u2019d start with buses Who\u2019s the greatest Labour leader of the last 50 years? Long-Bailey: Lauds Clement Attlee, whose leadership was not within the last half-century and then declines to name another whose does Starmer: Harold Wilson Nandy: Says she hopes the greatest is about to be elected and then cites the \u201cgreatest Labour leader that never was \u2013 Barbara Castle\u201d. The candidates ask how their economic policies would differ from the last manifesto and what the party would do to tackle inequality. Starmer says the party was right to talk about solidarity with people on lower incomes but that it didn\u2019t talk enough about opportunity for people. He says the UK is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and shouldn\u2019t have the levels of inequality \u2013 including regional inequality \u2013 it currently sees. Nandy says the country needs proper public services and a plan to pay for them. She repeats previous comments about targeting assets, saying the party needs to look at wealth taxes alongside income taxes. And she says it \u201ccosts more to be poor\u201d, citing things such as ATM costs in poorer areas. Long-Bailey says she recently met someone from the north-west of England who had got a job he was very pleased with but said it depressed her because it\u2019s not true of many people in Labour areas. She cites her plans for industrial strategy and improvements in education \u2013 including adult education. While the programme goes to an ad break, here\u2019s a comment from Labour on the resignation of the PM\u2019s adviser, Andrew Sabisky. Ian Lavery, the party chair, has said: It\u2019s right that Andrew Sabisky is no longer working in government. He should never have been appointed in the first place. After No 10 publicly stood by him today, Boris Johnson has serious questions to answer about how this appointment was made and whether he agrees with his vile views. The candidates are asked if trans rights pledges risk alienating female voters. The candidates have faced scrutiny over this issue. Nandy explained her support for trans women being held in prisons designated for females, saying she backed that \u2013 but not holding people who are risk to the safety of women in such areas. She says she does not want the debate to become a \u201czero-sum game\u201d. Long-Bailey calls on people to recognise the \u201cdehumanising\u201d process many trans people face in transitioning. Both Long-Bailey and Nandy have signed a pledge calling several organisations \u201ctrans-exclusionist hate groups\u201d. Echoing his comments in the last TV debate, Starmer says \u201ctrans rights are human rights\u201d and points out he signed a separate pledge he felt more accurately reflected his position. He says part of the problem with the debate on this issue is that it has been used as a \u201cpolitical football\u201d and declines to be drawn further. An audience member, Tamika Smith, asks about the death of Caroline Flack: \u201cWhat does it say about modern Britain?\u201d Starmer says social media sites have to take more responsibility for what is put on their platforms and mainstream media outlets need to stop amplifying the \u201cyards of abuse\u201d that can go on there. He adds that it is not helpful to attribute a single cause to the tragedy \u2013 he does not know and he does not want to pretend to know. There are always many causes and Flack\u2019s family will not want people to \u201cpontificate\u201d on television about her death. He suggests people display some human empathy. Nandy agrees, saying there is an unkindness in public life. She refers to a suicide case in her own constituency in which there had been significant bullying. She implores anyone suffering to seek help. Long-Bailey, similarly, does not want to focus on Flack\u2019s death in particular. In general terms, she agrees with Starmer\u2019s points about social media and cals on the government to take more enforcement action. She adds: \u201cIt costs nothing to be kind and that costs nothing and it comes from leadership from government.\u201d Long-Bailey is asked to elaborate on which of Labour\u2019s 2019 policies she would drop for the next election and she tells the audience she believed the issue was more about presentation. Asked by an audience member if Labour will simply \u201ctry Corbynism again\u201d, Long-Bailey says there were numerous reasons people abandoned Labour \u2013 including media attacks on the leadership. \u201cBut, ultimately, there was Brexit,\u201d she says. Asked what elements of Corbynism she would ditch, Long-Bailey says the policies were good but the party failed to communicate them. Starmer says Labour has lost four elections in a row and needs to come up with the answers. He says the leadership of the party, Brexit, the \u201cmanifesto overload\u201d and antisemitism all came up on the doorstep. But none of those on its own explains it, he adds. Asked what was wrong with Corbyn\u2019s leadership, Starmer says it was partly press vilification and that the former leader set up Labour as an anti-austerity party, among other things.

She lays the blame at the door of the leadership, saying voters did not believe Corbyn was \u201cfor\u201d them. Nandy adds that deindustrialisation of core Labour areas and an orthodoxy that insisted overall progress as a result of the current global economic system was more important than the prosperity and concerns of individual communities that did not fee they had benefited to the same degree. As the debate opens, the candidates hear from former Labour voters, as well as those who will vote for the next leader. They are told there was a lack of credibility in Labour\u2019s manifesto and that Brexit was one of the factors that drove people away; including one emotional Leave voter who said she privately apologised to her father as she voted Tory at the last election. You can read more details on the departure of the controversial Downing Street adviser here: This blog will be focusing more on the Labour leadership debate, which is due to start now. Andrew Sabisky has stepped down as an adviser to the prime minister amid intense scrutiny over his views on eugenics and other issues. Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman had earlier refused to say whether or not the prime minister agreed black people had lower IQs on average or that benefit claimants should be encouraged to have fewer children than people in work \u2013 all among the views expressed by Sabisky. Labour had called on No 10 to sack Sabisky, who was believed to have been contracted by Downing Street under Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, to work on special projects. The three remaining Labour leadership hopefuls \u2013 Lisa Nandy, Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey \u2013 face each other in another televised debate this evening. It follows the news on Friday evening that Emily Thornberry had not made it on to the ballot paper. You can read a bit more about that here: Since then, Starmer has been forced to defend Labour\u2019s Brexit policy amid claims it was the reason for the party\u2019s general election defeat. And Long-Bailey and Nandy have come under fire over their decision to sign a pledge drawn up by the Labour Campaign for Trans Rights group calling several organisations \u201ctrans-exclusionist hate groups\u201d. The Channel 4 debate airs at 8pm and will last about an hour. We\u2019ll bring you live coverage right here.",

It is understood several Tory politicians from black and minority ethnic backgrounds had made representations to No 10 about how the row of Sabisky\u2019s appointment was damaging for the party\u2019s relations with the black community. One Conservative MP from a BME background said: \u201cI\u2019m not necessarily against hiring intellectually interesting people with sometimes controversial views, but this guy just doesn\u2019t seem very smart, and if you are not very smart and at the very least appear bigoted that cannot be a good look for the party.

At least one Tory special adviser had also threatened to boycott meetings where Sabisky was present. Dr Adam Rutherford, a geneticist and author, accused Sabisky and Cummings of being \u201cbewitched by science, without having made the effort to understand the areas he is invoking, nor its history\u201d. He said the \u201cmoral repugnance\u201d of the remarks was \u201coverwhelming\u201d, adding: \u201cI am all for scientifically minded people advising government ...

      "bodyText": "Severe flood warnings remain in place and rescue operations were continuing in stricken communities on Monday evening, as the government faced criticism for its response to what has been described as unprecedented flooding in parts of the country. With thousands of properties flooded after a month\u2019s worth of rain fell on parts of Britain over the weekend, and more than 200 flood warnings still in place, Labour said it was \u201ca disgrace\u201d that the prime minister was not visiting affected towns and villages and was resisting calls to convene the Cobra emergencies committee. The political row came as police confirmed a body had been found in the search for a woman whose car is believed to have got stuck in high water in the West Midlands. She has been named as Yvonne Booth, 55, from Great Barr in Birmingham. Another five people are thought to have died in the flooding this weekend. Six \u201csevere\u201d flood warnings \u2013 meaning that there is a danger to life \u2013 were in place on Monday in Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Gloucestershire. Authorities said that the scale of flooding had been \u201cunprecedented\u201d in Wales. As Johnson was accused by the acting Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, of \u201cpretending that the floods were not happening\u201d, Downing Street said that he had no plans to visit any of the areas affected by flooding from Storm Dennis, and would instead spend the day working from a country house in Kent. A No 10 spokesman said he was being kept updated from Chevening, a government-owned historic property near Sevenoaks being used while work is continuing at Chequers, the official prime ministerial country retreat. Johnson was heckled last year and faced an angry response when he visited flood-hit communities in the north of England, as he declined to apologise over his government\u2019s slow response to events. The new environment secretary, George Eustice, on Monday defended the government\u2019s record on responding to the storms, and to the wider issue of flooding. \u201cThe government has a firm grip on this,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult situation, with widespread flood alerts, but our flood defences are working as intended.\u201d In the past year, he said, new flood-response infrastructure had protected more than 200,000 properties, with a further 100,000 due to be protected. The government had also pledged an extra \u00a34bn in funding for flood defences over the next five years, said Eustice. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got in place is working, and in these recent flood events nearly 20,000 properties have been protected,\u201d he said. The devolved Labour-led administration in Wales was also defending its response and preparedness as the first minister, Mark Drakeford, visited several homes in some of the worst hit-communities. \u201cOf course there is more to do. We have a \u00a3350m investment programme over this assembly term in flood and coastal flooding programmes,\u201d he said after visiting Oxford Street in Nantgarw, which saw heavy flooding this weekend, leaving properties and businesses ruined. In south Wales, police declared a \u201cmajor incident\u201d on Sunday after more than a month\u2019s rain fell in 48 hours, leading to multiple landslides and people being trapped in their homes. Pontypridd town centre was left underwater and surrounding towns and villages were told by the Met Office they could be cut off \u201cperhaps for several days\u201d because of the floods. More than 600 people in Pontypridd have been displaced and about 1,000 homes badly damaged. Alex Davies-Jones, the Labour MP for Pontypridd, criticised the prime minister\u2019s failure to visit the region: \u201cWhere is he? He\u2019s the Scarlet Pimpernel \u2013 you can never find him in an emergency.\u201d She said: \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Cobra been convened? This is a massive national emergency in my book. Parts of Wales have been hit that have never been hit before \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s so shocking about this. We need to understand why this has happened. The UK government needs to wake up and realise serious things are happening here in terms of climate change and our planet and it needs to address them now.\u201d Sian Williams, the head of operations for north-west Wales at Natural Resources Wales, said: \u201cThis is unprecedented. The worst-hit area was from the Brecon Beacons into the south Wales valleys. \u201cWe have had some of the highest levels we have ever seen in some rivers. The River Taff reached its highest level in over 40 years. This is unprecedented in terms of the scale of the rainfall and the levels of the rivers as well.\u201d Elsewhere, residents in Upton upon Severn and Uckinghall, in Worcestershire, were being advised to evacuate with water levels expected to rise on Monday evening. Towns including Shrewsbury in Shropshire, Bewdley in Worcestershire, and Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire were identified as being the government\u2019s greatest concern after the River Severn burst its banks. \u201cOur absolute priority is keeping people safe and as such we are asking the community in the affected areas to make alternative arrangements to stay with family and friends or to head to the rescue centre, where provisions are in place,\u201d said Ch Supt Tom Harding of West Mercia police. More torrential rain of the sort which had swelled rivers to \u201cexceptional\u201d levels was meanwhile forecast to fall later this week, warned the Environment Agency (EA). It warned that the flood risk continues, with further heavy rain forecast in the north of England for Wednesday and Thursday, possibly falling on already flooded areas. Boats were used to evacuate residents in towns such as Hereford, where water levels were described as \u201ctruly exceptional\u201d by David Throup, the EA\u2019s West Midlands environment manager. \u201cThey are the highest levels we\u2019ve ever recorded on the River Wye and those records go back 200 years,\u201d he told Sky News. Britain\u2019s transport network was also hit by a third day of disruption, including at Heathrow, where more than 90 flights at the UK\u2019s largest airport were cancelled due to the knock-on effect of what was described as a \u201ctechnical issue\u201d. Motorists continued to face treacherous driving conditions, with roads rendered impassable around the country, while fallen trees caused chaos to train services. CrossCountry, Great Western Railway, Northern, South Western Railway, Southern, Thameslink and Transport for Wales were among the operators with delays and cancellations.",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Sabisky, who resigned as a No 10 adviser on Monday night, had been criticised for a series of controversial opinions he had expressed publicly. He claimed in 2014 in a blogpost that there was a racial difference in intelligence: There are excellent reasons to think the very real racial differences in intelligence are significantly \u2013 even mostly \u2013 genetic in origin, though the degree is of course a very serious subject of scholarly debate. That debate busily bustles on, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have more precise answers in another 5 years or so, though whether the politicians will pay any attention is debatable. It would be nice if they did from the standpoint of immigration control (in the UK, that is). He suggested in a 2014 blogpost reply that black Americans are on average less intelligent than white Americans: If the mean black American IQ is (best estimate based on a century\u2019s worth of data) around 85, as compared to a mean white American IQ of 100, then if IQ is normally distributed (which it is), you will see a far greater percentage of blacks than whites in the range of IQs 75 or below, at which point we are close to the typical boundary for mild mental retardation. Typically criminals with IQs below 70 cannot be executed in the USA, I believe. That parsimoniously explains the greater diagnostic rates for blacks when it comes to \u2018Intellectual disability\u2019. Sabisky suggested introducing compulsory contraception under a blogpost by Dominic Cummings in 2014: One way to get around the problems of unplanned pregnancies creating a permanent underclass would be to legally enforce universal uptake of long-term contraception at the onset of puberty. Vaccination laws give it a precedent, I would argue. He proposed allocation of government money based on IQ tests for all 11-year-olds under a blogpost by Dominic Cummings in 2015: Why not just give everyone an IQ test at 11 and give secondary schools pupil premium money based on the number of below-average-ability students they get \u2013 the correlation between IQ [at] 11 and GCSE score 5 years later is a hefty .8!\u201d In a review of the book The Welfare Trait by Dr Adam Perkins in 2016 he suggested that benefits claimants could be discouraged from having lots of children: A large body of evidence, which Perkins reviews, supports the intuitive idea that habitual welfare claimants tend to be less conscientious and agreeable than the average person. Such habitual claimants also tend to reproduce at higher rates than the general population, a pattern found across nations and time periods \u2026 With praiseworthy boldness, Perkins gets off the fence and recommends concrete policy solutions for the problems that he identifies, arguing that governments should try to adjust the generosity of welfare payments to the point where habitual claimants do not have greater fertility than those customarily employed \u2026 The explicit targeting of fertility as a goal of welfare policy, however, goes beyond current government policy. Perkins perhaps should also have argued for measures to boost the fertility of those with pro-social personalities, such as deregulation of the childcare and housing markets to cut the costs of sustainable family formation.\u201d On the Good Judgment Project website in 2016 he argued that Turkey joining the EU should be a non-starter over its \u201ctroublesome\u201d migrants: The EU already has enough of a problem with migration \u2013 the entire population of Turkey being granted freedom to move to any European nation is absolutely unthinkable.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 18 February. Top stories The Australian government has claimed it does not owe welfare recipients a duty of care over the robodebt scandal and has denied alleged debtors were placed under \u201cduress\u201d, despite admitting in court documents that some debts were based on \u201cfalse\u201d assumptions. Documents filed in the federal court reveal the government has conceded that debts issued using tax office income summaries could \u201cnot be validly established\u201d under the law. But the government argues it should not be required to pay compensation for damages because social security law makes no mention of a need to exercise \u201cdue or reasonable care\u201d. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 454. More than 200 Australians stranded on the Diamond Princess will be flown to the Northern Territory, where they must remain in quarantine for a further 14 days. Meanwhile concern is growing over possible infections among passengers from another cruise liner that docked in Cambodia last week. On Sunday a traveller from the MS Westerdam was confirmed to have the virus in Malaysia, days after disembarking along with hundreds of other passengers. The UK is trying to contact Britons who left the ship. The new coronavirus causes only mild disease in four out of five people who get it, the World Health Organisation has said. Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis has caused a spike in concern about the environment, a slump in the popularity of the Coalition and Scott Morrison, and a drop in support for new coalmines, even among Coalition voters. A poll conducted by the Australian National University\u2019s Centre for Social Research and Methods found a \u201csignificant and substantial decline\u201d in the Coalition\u2019s vote from 40% in October 2019 to 35% in January. Australia A flexible solar \u201cskin\u201d that could be used to generate power is a step closer to development after the technology was used to break a world record for electricity conversion, researchers say. Australia risks becoming \u201ca magnet for dirty money\u201d from abusers and kleptocrats across the globe, says the man who spearheaded the United States\u2019 Magnitsky Act \u2013 which targets sanctions against human rights violators around the world \u2013 unless it brings in similar legislation. Labor is pursuing the Liberals over the deleted record of a $165,000 donation from a key Scott Morrison ally. The opposition will ask the joint standing committee on electoral matters to examine the circumstances of the donation, which was initially disclosed by the Liberals, then removed entirely after questions from the Guardian. Liberal Katie Allen says Australia needs to join the emissions technology revolution, saying the world is approaching an \u201ciPhone moment\u201d when it comes to new technology lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and Australia needs to be part of the revolution, rather than being a technology \u201ctaker\u201d. The world Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald has rejected suggestions of a pact between Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, centrist rivals that have dominated Irish politics for a century.

If not, another election looms. Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman has refused to say whether Johnson thinks black people have lower IQs, or agrees with eugenics, after No 10 hired an adviser with highly controversial views. Donald Trump attended the wedding this weekend of controversial White House aide Stephen Miller, who has been condemned for his links to white nationalism and his hardline stance on immigration. Greece has halted plans to construct new detention centres on outlying islands facing Turkey amid mounting opposition from resident communities who fear they will become permanent. A second nest of 16 snakes has been found dumped outside a fire station in the UK, days after 13 royal pythons were found in the same spot. Recommended reads Mallacoota resident and photographer Rachel Mounsey documented the bushfires that destroyed some 150 houses in her town and its surrounds. \u201cWhen the New Year\u2019s fire bore down on my town of Mallacoota I began to imagine the fire as a type of medieval dragon \u2013 heavy-footed and angry \u2013 coming towards us to destroy everything in its way,\u201d she says. Weeks after the catastrophe, Mounsey sits with neighbours who lost their homes, and asks: how do you move on mentally when all you own has turned to ash?

I was struggling with understanding how it happened and why it happened as I was feeling good with no injuries and enjoying training with the team, so it was frustrating at the time.\u201d The England international is yet to return to training but is back in the fold at Cobham. \u201cWhen I became ill the frustration went away as I didn\u2019t even have the energy to be frustrated. I had no emotion as I was too tired. \u201cIt took over my life in a negative way. I couldn\u2019t even get up to make food,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that I am feeling more like a human being I can smile again and be in a room with people again. Before, when people were having conversations with me, I couldn\u2019t acknowledge them. I was just sitting there thinking: \u2018I am so ill, I am so ill,\u2019 it was just constantly on my mind.\u201d The focus now is about being patient. \u201cNow I am coming to the other end of it I am back around the girls more. I have the energy to come in or go to the pool when they are doing recovery. \u201cI want to be back on the pitch more than anyone. I also know it will take time and I am not going to heal overnight and it is a day-by-day process.\u201d The Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, who has been fiercely protective of her forward when questioned about the player\u2019s health, said: \u201cFran is a massively important part of our squad and she knows that. But while winning football matches is important it is not more important than her health. \u201cOur job, when she is ready, is to make sure she comes back at an even higher level than before.\u201d Chelsea advance in FA Cup thanks to Guro Reitan Chelsea will play Everton in the FA Cup quarter-finals after a goal from Guro Reiten took them past Liverpool at Kingsmeadow. Chelsea missed out on a place in the final to the eventual winners, Manchester City, at the semi-final stage last season, having completed a league and FA Cup double the preceding year. And again they are into the latter stages of the competition, with Reiten\u2019s first-half strike enough to secure a narrow 1-0 victory. Their last-eight opponents, Everton, who have performed impressively in the Women\u2019s Super League, put five past their fellow WSL side Bristol City to ensure their passage. Lucy Graham scored twice for Willie Kirk\u2019s team, with the Dutch forward Inessa Kaagman, Hannah Cain and Manchester City loanee Esme Morgan all on the scoresheet. Their quarter-final tie will be played at the club\u2019s new Walton Hall Park home, having finally made the move from their temporary home at Southport. A north London derby is on the cards after Tottenham were handed a tie against the winner of Arsenal\u2019s game against the Championship side Lewes, which was postponed due to Storm Dennis on Sunday. Spurs beat Coventry United 5-0 thanks to a Rianna Dean hat-trick and goals from Lucia Marte Leon and the Dutch defender Siri Worm. Manchester City will play either the Championship side Leicester or Reading, after their game was also postponed due to the storm. Meanwhile the WSL strugglers Birmingham will take on the winner of Crystal Palace v Brighton.",

Germany, the world\u2019s fourth largest economy, is also expected to stumble as the coronavirus epidemic and a slump in trade with China combine with weak consumer demand to drag growth lower. The German central bank, the Bundesbank, said on Monday the country\u2019s major industrial sectors \u2013 from cars to chemicals \u2013 were continuing to see a fall in orders \u201calbeit with a decrease in intensity\u201d. \u201cHowever, economic risks exist with regard to the coronavirus outbreak in the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d the bank\u2019s latest report said. With two of the largest exporting nations signalling that they are in trouble, economists have begun to rewrite their forecasts for growth for the global economy in 2020. Germany, say Moody\u2019s analysts, will cling to a 1% growth rate this year and Japan will recover, but only slightly, to register a 0.3% growth rate. However, the plunge in Japan\u2019s output at the end of 2019, which amounted to 1.6% quarter on quarter, is expected to drag down growth in the current quarter and possibly the next. A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of falling output. Moody\u2019s, the credit ratings agency, said the impact of the coronavirus on China and Japan\u2019s economy would be widely felt, and not just in major trading partners such as Germany. The euro area more broadly is expected to grow by 1.2% in 2020, only modestly better than the 1.1% growth rate registered in 2019. Meanwhile the UK will outpace only Italy and Japan among the major economies, after Moody\u2019s held its projections of Britain\u2019s GDP growth for this year and 2021 at 1%. The firm also reduced its growth forecast for China to 5.2% in 2020 and maintained its expectation of 5.7% growth in 2021, down from 6% last year, which was the lowest for 30 years. Phillippe Waechter, chief economist at Ostrom Asset Management, said the timing of a VAT increase in Japan had had an unfortunate impact on growth after 18 months of battles between China and the US over trade tariffs. Japan\u2019s economy minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, said the government was ready to take all necessary steps and was watching the impact the coronavirus outbreak could have on the economy and specifically tourism. The Japanese economy should also get a boost from the Tokyo Olympic Games later this year.",

The critical meeting between Mick Mulvaney and Johnson\u2019s chief aide comes amid speculation that the White House wants the UK to commit to removing the Chinese company from British mobile phone networks in three to five years\u2019 time. A possible compromise would allow the two countries to work together on developing alternatives, and ease Washington\u2019s concerns about the security of the existing intelligence-sharing between the two countries. Senior White House officials have made repeated warnings over the past few days about the UK\u2019s decision to allow Huawei to supply 5G network equipment, but on Sunday night Trump himself waded into the debate. Richard Grenell, the US ambassador to Germany, tweeted that he had just been called by Trump from the presidential plane, Air Force 1, to pass on a message that referred directly to Huawei, although he did not mention the company by name. The diplomat\u2019s tweet said that he had been instructed \u201cto make clear that any nation who chooses to use an untrustworthy 5G vendor will jeopardize our ability to share intelligence and information at the highest level\u201d.

London is Burberry\u2019s home, but its commercial heartbeat is now in Asia. With Chinese customers accounting for 40% of Burberry revenues, the brand is one of those that has been hit hardest by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/12/bitcoin-back-over-10000-dollars-amid-coronavirus-concerns\">economic impact</a> of coronavirus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/14/interview-burberry-designer-riccardo-tisci\">In the trenches: Riccardo Tisci on his new era at Burberry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With a troupe of expensive supermodels, Tisci\u2019s fourth season at Burberry was a slick cheerleading routine for the blue-blooded glamour that flows through the label\u2019s veins. In the Victorian pomp of Kensington Olympia, where the iron ribs spanning the vaulted ceiling soar above the mirrored catwalk like the skeleton of a blue whale, a grand piano was the centrepiece for a dressage parade of modern equestrian chic. This season\u2019s look was a more globally bankable take on Burberry than Tisci\u2019s punk- and rave-referencing, subculture-themed collections of last year.</p> <p>Tisci has made Burberry sexy where his predecessor Christopher Bailey made it romantic. His equestrian silhouette owed as much to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jilly-cooper\">Jilly Cooper</a> as to the Grand National. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/16/harvey-weinstein-trial-gigi-hadid-juror-dismissed\">Gigi Hadid</a> wore high, tight jodhpurs tucked into glossy boots. Blazers had nipped waists, and trenchcoats were reinvented as slippery satin dresses with multiple unfastenings. The Victorian architecture of the venue was echoed in corsetry outlines on evening wear, while quilted nylon stable-hand jackets looked a strong commercial offer for the more street-orientated Burberry customer. This was a collection tailored to helping Burberry weather the current economic storm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cf4d945cf6ab0171477e5f2cc187eea0051083f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf4d945cf6ab0171477e5f2cc187eea0051083f0/0_69_2487_3332/746.jpg\" alt=\"Models present creations during the Burberry catwalk show\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This season\u2019s look was a more globally bankable take than Tisci\u2019s subculture-themed collections of last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than a third of the label\u2019s 64 stores in mainland China have been closed since the coronavirus outbreak hit the region. This month, the company\u2019s chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, acknowledged the material negative effect of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/burberry-impact-coronavirus-hong-kong-china\">the outbreak </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/burberry-impact-coronavirus-hong-kong-china\"> on luxury demand</a>. It is a further blow to Burberry, already hit hard by the effect on retail of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/06/a-battle-for-the-soul-of-the-city-why-violence-has-spiralled-in-the-hong-kong-protests\">anti-gove</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/06/a-battle-for-the-soul-of-the-city-why-violence-has-spiralled-in-the-hong-kong-protests\">rnment protests in Hong Kong</a>, where its sales in the final quarter of 2019 were down 50% on the previous year.</p> <p>This London fashion week show had been scheduled to be reprised in Shanghai, on 23 April, at an event for Chinese press, influencers and clients that would have featured the same clothes alongside exclusive additional looks for Chinese Burberry customers. When the Shanghai show was announced, Tisci described China as \u201ca country that has always been so supportive of me\u201d and Shanghai as \u201cone of the most innovative and inspiring cities in the world\u201d. The event has been postponed indefinitely.</p> <p>At the day\u2019s earlier shows by Erdem and at JW Anderson, the 1920s made a comeback. Shawl-collared tuxedos of the roaring 20s inspired the wing-collared padded coats at JW Anderson, which he called \u201cnouveau chic\u201d.</p> <p>Erdem, whose modernist flamboyant gowns are a feature of the art-fair social scene, worked with Robin Muir, the curator of the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s upcoming exhibition about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/20/cecil-beaton-exhibition-put-spotlight-bright-young-things-national-portrait-gallery\">Cecil Beaton</a>, to develop themes from the exhibition on his catwalk.</p> <p>\u201cBeaton was truly experimental \u2013 so much more than a society photographer,\u201d said Erdem backstage in front of a mood board showing the teenage Beaton\u2019s early stage sets in which he dressed up his sisters and himself in 20s gowns against makeshift backdrops. On the catwalk, Beaton\u2019s own leopard-print dressing gown became a camel coat embroidered with seed pearls clustered into tiny paw-print motifs.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cLondon is the place where I learned to be myself and a city where I gained the confidence to be the man that I am today,\u201d said Riccardo Tisci, the chief creative officer of Burberry, before his London fashion week show on Monday. \u201cNow I want to share British style with the world and use this incredible heritage to build and humanise the house.\u201d Burberry, British luxury fashion\u2019s marquee name, could use a boost in morale. London is Burberry\u2019s home, but its commercial heartbeat is now in Asia. With Chinese customers accounting for 40% of Burberry revenues, the brand is one of those that has been hit hardest by the economic impact of coronavirus. With a troupe of expensive supermodels, Tisci\u2019s fourth season at Burberry was a slick cheerleading routine for the blue-blooded glamour that flows through the label\u2019s veins. In the Victorian pomp of Kensington Olympia, where the iron ribs spanning the vaulted ceiling soar above the mirrored catwalk like the skeleton of a blue whale, a grand piano was the centrepiece for a dressage parade of modern equestrian chic. This season\u2019s look was a more globally bankable take on Burberry than Tisci\u2019s punk- and rave-referencing, subculture-themed collections of last year. Tisci has made Burberry sexy where his predecessor Christopher Bailey made it romantic. His equestrian silhouette owed as much to Jilly Cooper as to the Grand National. Gigi Hadid wore high, tight jodhpurs tucked into glossy boots. Blazers had nipped waists, and trenchcoats were reinvented as slippery satin dresses with multiple unfastenings. The Victorian architecture of the venue was echoed in corsetry outlines on evening wear, while quilted nylon stable-hand jackets looked a strong commercial offer for the more street-orientated Burberry customer. This was a collection tailored to helping Burberry weather the current economic storm. More than a third of the label\u2019s 64 stores in mainland China have been closed since the coronavirus outbreak hit the region. This month, the company\u2019s chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, acknowledged the material negative effect of the outbreak on luxury demand. It is a further blow to Burberry, already hit hard by the effect on retail of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, where its sales in the final quarter of 2019 were down 50% on the previous year. This London fashion week show had been scheduled to be reprised in Shanghai, on 23 April, at an event for Chinese press, influencers and clients that would have featured the same clothes alongside exclusive additional looks for Chinese Burberry customers. When the Shanghai show was announced, Tisci described China as \u201ca country that has always been so supportive of me\u201d and Shanghai as \u201cone of the most innovative and inspiring cities in the world\u201d. The event has been postponed indefinitely. At the day\u2019s earlier shows by Erdem and at JW Anderson, the 1920s made a comeback. Shawl-collared tuxedos of the roaring 20s inspired the wing-collared padded coats at JW Anderson, which he called \u201cnouveau chic\u201d. Erdem, whose modernist flamboyant gowns are a feature of the art-fair social scene, worked with Robin Muir, the curator of the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s upcoming exhibition about Cecil Beaton, to develop themes from the exhibition on his catwalk. \u201cBeaton was truly experimental \u2013 so much more than a society photographer,\u201d said Erdem backstage in front of a mood board showing the teenage Beaton\u2019s early stage sets in which he dressed up his sisters and himself in 20s gowns against makeshift backdrops. On the catwalk, Beaton\u2019s own leopard-print dressing gown became a camel coat embroidered with seed pearls clustered into tiny paw-print motifs.",

necessary measure to stop the virus from spreading, claiming it can be latent in a person for up to 24 days. </p> <p>The St Petersburg branch of Rospotrebnadzor did not respond to a request for comment on the effectiveness of the court ruling, given that Ilyina has already roamed free for almost 10 days after escaping.</p> <p>Last week, at least three other people in quarantine for possible

      "bodyText": "Here is quick summary of the latest coronavirus developments across the globe over the past few hours: A Holiday Inn hotel at Heathrow has been block-booked to serve as a coronavirus facility for those at risk of spreading the disease. British passengers stuck on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan could be flown home as the government considers a repatriation flight. It is too early to tell if the decline in new cases will continue, the WHO chief said, but the virus is certainly not as deadly as previous outbreaks. Doctors in Shanghai have started using the blood plasma from those who have recovered from the disease to treat new patients. Nearly half of China\u2019s population is living under some form of travel restrictions. The number of global cases is now over 71,000 - the vast majority are in mainland China, with 99 new cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Doctors in Shanghai are using infusions of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the coronavirus to treat those still battling the infection, with some encouraging results. A top emergency expert at the World Health Organization said that using convalescent plasma was a \u201cvery valid\u201d approach to test, but it was important to get the timing right to maximise the boost to a patient\u2019s immunity. China\u2019s financial hub of Shanghai has had 332 infected cases, one of whom died in recent weeks. Lu Hongzhou, professor and co-director of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, said that 184 people were still in hospital , including 166 mild cases, while 18 were in serious and critical conditions, Reuters reports. He said the hospital had set up a special clinic to administer plasma therapy and was selecting patients who were willing to donate. The blood would be screened to check if he or she had other diseases like hepatitis B or C, he added. \u201cWe are positive that this method can be very effective in our patients,\u201d he said. There are no fully licensed treatments or vaccines against the new coronavirus, and the process of developing and testing drugs can take many months and even years. Convalescent plasma has been proven \u201ceffective and life-saving\u201d against other infectious diseases, including rabies and diphtheria, Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHO health emergencies programme, told reporters in Geneva. It is a very important area to pursue. Because what hyperimmune globulin does is it concentrates the antibodies in a recovered patient. You are essentially giving the new victim\u2019s immune system a boost of antibodies to hopefully get them through the very difficult phase. So it must be given at the right time, because it mops up the virus in the system, and it just gives the new patient\u2019s immune system a vital push at the time it needs it. But it has to be carefully timed and it\u2019s not always successful. Ryan added: \u201cSo it is a very important area of discovery, and I believe they are starting trials on that in China. But it is a very valid way to explore therapeutics, especially when we don\u2019t have vaccines and we don\u2019t have specific antivirals.\u201d As well as using plasma therapies, the Chinese doctors are also trying antiviral drugs licensed for use against other infections to see if they might help. Scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are due in weeks, while the head of a Wuhan hospital had said plasma infusions from recovered patients had shown some encouraging preliminary results. The deaths of four members of the same family in Wuhan have raised concerns over the practice of self-isolating at home, Chinese media group Caixin reports. Chang Kai, a director at Hubei Film Studios, died on 14 February aged 55 from pneumonia caused by the Covid-19 virus, according to an obituary published by his employer. His father, mother and older sister also died from the disease between 28 January and 14 February, according to the Caixin story. Chang Kai reportedly tried to take his ill father to a number of hospitals, but was turned away at each one due to a lack of beds. His father died at home a few days later. Many people in Wuhan isolating at home, as over-stretched hospitals struggle with the huge number of cases in the city. However, health experts have raised concerns that home quarantine can lead to cross-household and cross-community infections China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, spelled out his plan to contain the coronavirus crisis at a meeting of the core Chinese leadership today, Reuters reports. In the speech, Xi admitted there were \u201cshortcomings\u201d in China\u2019s emergency response systems and said local officials would be punished if they failed to \u201ctake responsibility\u201d or implement directives. He also condemned the \u201cmajor hidden danger\u201d of eating wild animals. The speech was noteworthy for putting Xi at the centre of events earlier than had been previously revealed, analysts said, as he referred to directions he\u2019d given at a 7 January meeting. Analysts also said the internal speech was unusual for being released to the public on Saturday, relatively soon after it was given. Xi was mostly absent from Chinese state media coverage of the crisis in its early days. His first public comments on the outbreak were on 20 January. A Pakistani international student on a university campus in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in China, has told of how he and other international students have been ordered not to leave their dormitories. More than 100 foreign students at Wuhan\u2019s Zhongnan University of Economics and Law had been allowed to visit grocery stores for one hour a week to purchase basic necessities. They have now apparently been advised to remain in isolation to reduce the risk of possible disease spread, though it is unclear if anyone has contracted the deadly virus. \u201cThere are lots of people in this situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not alone. For the past few days, we have been told to stay in our room and not go anywhere. Our exterior doors are locked and we cannot go outside.\u201d He and his fellow students spend most of their time in their rooms, only leaving to cook food in bulk to then refrigerate. The student said: We try to avoid talking to each other because we are scared. Face-to-face contact is limited and most of the time I stayed in my room. We speak over the internet. Since the university was closed in the beginning of January, students from Bangladesh, Nepal, Russia and elsewhere have been returned to their home countries, but those from some African and Latin American states are also among those who pass the days reading books, phoning home and watching TV. Movement has been increasingly restricted and prices of groceries have allegedly doubled. The student said the university administration was trying its best to manage the situation, but is required to keep the students indoors. They have basically told us if one of us gets infected, it will spread quickly to everyone else as we live in close proximity. At the moment we don\u2019t know if anyone is infected or not, we are so afraid. It still feels like a worst nightmare. Pakistani authorities have reportedly said that more than 500 students from the country are in Wuhan, but no plans for their evacuation have yet been announced. The Pakistani student said: All students are scared and waiting for this disaster to end or our countries to rescue us. We are trying to stay strong and encourage each other. It is too early to tell if the recent decline in new coronavirus cases will continue, the World Health Organization chief has said, and data must be interpreted \u201ccautiously\u201d. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of WHO, said in a press conference today: This trend must be interpreted very cautiously. Trends can change as new populations are affected. It\u2019s too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table. He added that the virus seems to be \u201cnot as deadly as other coronavirus including Sars and Mers\u201d, with the majority of patients making a full recovery. More than 80% of patients have mild disease and will recover. In about 14% of cases, the virus causes severe diseases including pneumonia and shortness of breath. And about 5% of patients have critical diseases including respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure. In 2% of reported cases, the virus is fatal, and the risk of death increases the older you are. We see relatively few cases among children. More research is needed to understand why. Nearly half of China\u2019s population is living under some form of travel restrictions, CNN analysis has revealed, as authorities strive to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Travel restrictions of varying degrees are still being enforced across a number of provinces and cities in mainland China, affecting over 780 million people. This includes Hubei, Liaoning, Beijing and Shanghai, with restrictions ranging from self-quarantines to limits on who can come and go from neighbourhoods. The strictest measures have been implemented in Hubei\u2019s four cities \u2013 Wuhan, Huanggang, Shiyan and Xiaogan \u2013 which have completely sealed off all residential complexes and communities. Residents receive daily essentials from neighbourhood committees, and the use of non-essential vehicles on motorways is banned. The World Health Organization is working \u201cvery closely\u201d with the Japanese authorities regarding the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off the coast of Japan. Dr Sylvie Briand, director of pandemic and epidemic diseases at the WHO, said: We need to make sure that we focus on our objective, our public health objective, which is to contain the virus, and not to contain the people. And making sure that we can have the right balance between the health of the population in Japan and other countries, but also the health of the people currently on this boat. She said there was so much still unknown about the virus that measures were monitored on a nearly hourly basis as authorities learned more about the disease. The Department of Health has confirmed that a Holiday Inn at Heathrow Airport has been block booked to be used as a coronavirus facility. The hotel will be used by those who are considered at risk but have nowhere else to go. It can be used as a place for people to self-isolate if they have been advised to do so, and to be tested for the virus and await results. All tests will be carried out by clinicians and anyone who does test positive will be transferred straight to hospital. Heathrow is the UK\u2019s largest airline hub both in terms of incoming passengers but also those in transit. The son of a British couple stuck onboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship has renewed appeals for the UK government to help his parents. Steve Abel appeared in a video posted on his father\u2019s YouTube channel and admitted that his \u201cgreatest fear\u201d was that his parents would become separated in Japan. Throughout the video he displayed a white piece of paper reading \u201cMum and Dad are fine!\u201d but said that his parents were beginning to feel the effects of living in quarantine for an extended period of time. He said: Please bear in mind they\u2019ve been on that cruise ship for 28 days. They\u2019re getting pretty fed up and they are the way they are because of the stress, the confinement within the cabin. Steve also asked the authorities to give his parents more information. This is my plea \u2013 I want my mum and dad to wake up in the morning and actually have some information sent to them; they need to be communicated with. We\u2019re seeing things on the news and we\u2019re seeing things are happening but they\u2019re getting nothing, no one is actually speaking to them, which is driving them crazy. They must be going crazy as it is just being inside that cabin. Abel said he was extremely concerned that his parents may be separated abroad. Becoming visibly emotional, he said: My greatest fear is if they\u2019re separated. If they\u2019re not both on a flight home. But we\u2019re not going to think like that because they\u2019re coming home. Japan is on the brink of recession, after its economy shrank at its fastest pace in more than five years as the impact of the coronavirus epidemic continues to set in. Official figures showed gross domestic product (GDP) declined by 1.6% in the last quarter. If GDP falls for a second successive quarter, the economy will be in recession. Along with the coronavirus, a sales tax hitting consumer and business spending, and the impact of a major typhoon have also hit the world\u2019s third-largest economy badly. Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a pretty good chance the economy will suffer another contraction in January-March. \u201cThe virus will mainly hit inbound tourism and exports, but could also weigh on domestic consumption quite a lot. \u201cIf this epidemic is not contained by the time of the Tokyo Olympic Games, the damage to the economy will be huge.\u201d You can find out more on our Business live blog. A Russian court has ordered a woman who escaped from quarantine after testing negative for the disease to return to hospital for at least two more days. Alla llyina was admitted to hospital in St Petersburg on 6 February with a sore throat and was tested for the new coronavirus as she had returned from China five days earlier. She broke out of the hospital the next day by disabling an electronic lock in her room, after finding out she would have to spend 14 days in isolation instead of the 24 hours that doctors promised her. In an Instagram post, Ilyina wrote: \u201cWild. All three tests showed I was completely healthy, so why the hell the quarantine?\u201d Several days later, Russia\u2019s public health watchdog, Rospotrebnadzor, filed a lawsuit against her, asking the court to order compulsory confinement in hospital. Ilyina\u2019s defence lawyer argued during the court hearing on Monday that she didn\u2019t pose any danger to people around her and noted that she was allowed into a courtroom packed with dozens of people, none of whom wore masks. Health officials maintained that isolating Ilyina was a necessary measure to stop the virus from spreading, claiming it can be latent in a person for up to 24 days. The St Petersburg branch of Rospotrebnadzor did not respond to a request for comment on the effectiveness of the court ruling, given that Ilyina has already roamed free for almost 10 days after escaping. Last week, at least three other people in quarantine for possible coronavirus infection fled the same St Petersburg hospital. Two of them have since returned while the third a woman, named Anna Rybakova, remains at large, according to media reports. Rospotrebnadzor has filed a lawsuit to bring Rybakova back to the hospital as well, with a hearing scheduled for Wednesday. The chief of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, announced on Monday that health officials were looking into introducing harsher measures for patients who violated quarantine rules and stricter quarantine protocols. Russia has recorded only two cases of the Covid-19 disease, two Chinese citizens who have been treated and released. However, Russian authorities have confined in hospital hundreds of people who returned from China as a precaution. Russia has also halted most air traffic to China, suspended all trains to China and North Korea, and closed its land border with China and Mongolia. Russia\u2019s prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, has also said Russia may start deporting foreigners infected with the virus. A Russian woman onboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan is the first Russian citizen to be diagnosed with the disease. Here are the latest figures reported by each government\u2019s health authority as of Monday in Beijing, as the number of global cases reaches over 71,000: Mainland China: 1,770 deaths among 70,548 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei Hong Kong: 58 cases, 1 death Macao: 10 Japan: 519 cases, including 454 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, 1 death Singapore: 77 cases Thailand: 35 South Korea: 30 Malaysia: 22 Taiwan: 20 cases, 1 death Vietnam: 16 cases Germany: 16 United States: 15 cases; separately, 1 US citizen died in China Australia: 14 cases France: 12 cases, 1 death United Kingdom: 9 cases United Arab Emirates: 9 Canada: 8 Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death India: 3 cases Italy: 3 Russia: 2 Spain: 2 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 Egypt: 1 Richard Branson has responded to calls for help from those on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, saying Virgin Atlantic is in discussions with the UK government. Previously British passengers David and Sally Abel had made a direct appeal to the British business magnate to help fly them home, after the lack of action from the UK government over evacuation flights. A No 10 spokesman has since confirmed the Foreign Office is in contact with those on the ship to discuss a possible flight home. The University of Sussex said its student who was being checked for the Covid-19 coronavirus has tested negative. A spokesman said: \u201cRecently a student on our campus was tested and has been informed they do not have coronavirus. \u201cThe university is operating as usual and we continue to follow all the advice and guidance from Public Health England.\u201d Jessica Murray here, taking the reins for the rest of the afternoon - feel free to get in touch via @journojess_ on Twitter or jessica.murray@theguardian.com. A Holiday Inn near Heathrow airport has been closed to the public and designated as a potential coronavirus quarantine centre, the Independent has reported. The Holiday Inn Heathrow Ariel hotel, on Bath Road, closed on Saturday and staff were told it would not re-open for bookings until March at the earliest. The Independent reports that the hotel has been block-booked to be used as a potential quarantine zone for international visitors to the UK who develop coronavirus or for Britons evacuated to the UK from overseas. Guests booked at the Holiday Inn have been transferred to sister hotels. The hotel\u2019s general manager confirmed the hotel had been closed but said there had not been any cases of coronavirus at the hotel. From one cruise ship to another, the MS Westerdam ship, which eventually docked in Cambodia after being turned away from a number of Asian ports, has sparked some global concerns after a passenger coronavirus case was confirmed. An 83-year-old American woman who was on the ship tested positive for the virus in Malaysia, where she had flown to. Movement of passengers and crew has now stopped, with some in hotels in Cambodia\u2019s capital, Phnom Penh, and others still onboard the ship. The American woman was among several hundred passengers who were flown out of Cambodia on Friday and Saturday. According to authorities in Malaysia, 143 continued their flights home from that country, while the woman and her 84-year-old husband, who was diagnosed with pneumonia, remained behind for treatment. The dispersal around the world of passengers from the ship with possible exposure to the virus has sparked concern. \u201cI think now, given that there is a confirmed case that is suspected to have acquired infection on board the ship, the other passengers should be asked to quarantine themselves at home and alert health authorities if they develop fever or respiratory symptoms within the 14 days since disembarkation,\u201d said Prof Benjamin Cowling, from the School of Public Health at Hong Kong University. At this time, no other guests or crew onboard or at the hotel have reported any symptoms of the illness. Guests who have already returned home will be contacted by their local health department and provided further information, the ship\u2019s operator said. Several Westerdam passengers have already returned home and spoken to the media. Two Canadians who returned via Vancouver international airport were asked to put on protective face masks on arrival but were not otherwise isolated, Canada\u2019s CBC News reported. Hansen, from Surrey, British Columbia, told CBC that he did not hear about the American woman in Malaysia with the virus until he landed in Vancouver on Sunday. He said: I guess on the one hand it\u2019s upsetting to know that there was one case, but we\u2019re feeling fine. We\u2019ve had health scans, temperature scans and we don\u2019t have any concerns for our own health. Cambodia\u2019s government had originally earned kudos from the head of the World Health Organization for allowing the ship to dock, after it was turned away by Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Guam and Thailand. However, Cambodia\u2019s handling of the ship\u2019s passengers has since been criticised on social media, though it also has got some support. \u201cI think it would not be appropriate to keep passengers on the ship for 14 days, as it could be a high-risk environment,\u201d said Cowling. \u201cWe have seen the consequences of holding passengers on a cruise ship with the Diamond Princess outbreak,\u201d he said, referring to the cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama, Japan, which now has hundreds of coronavirus cases. The UK joins a growing number of countries considering repatriating citizens on the Diamond Princess. Israel\u2019s ministry of health has said it is preparing to evacuate several Israelis from the ship back to the country. In a statement, the ministry said three Israelis on the cruise ship had tested positive for coronavirus and would remain in Japan. However, the ministry added it was contacting insurance companies of the remaining 12 Israeli nationals onboard to have them flown back via a special direct flight. \u201cUpon returning they will enter home quarantine and undergo medical follow-up tests,\u201d it said. Foreign Office ministers are looking at chartering another flight to repatriate some or all of the 74 Britons on board the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship hit by 454 cases of coronavirus. \u201cWe sympathise with all those caught up in this extremely difficult situation,\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s deputy official spokesman said. \u201cThe Foreign Office is in contact with all British people on the Diamond Princess, including to establish interest in a possible repatriation flight. \u201cWe are urgently considering all options to guarantee the health and safety of those on board.\u201d Here are the latest developments: Of the 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, 14 have tested positive for coronavirus, the US state department said on Monday. Japanese officials have confirmed a further 99 people have been infected by the new coronavirus onboard the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, bringing the total to 45. A Russian woman who was onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner docked in Yokohama, Japan, has tested positive for coronavirus, the Russian embassy in Japan said on Monday. Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesperson confirmed the government was in contact with the 74 Britons on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship. China\u2019s parliament and its top political consultative body are both considering delaying annual meetings set for March. The standing committee of the parliament will meet on 24 February to deliberate the postponement, Reuters reports. The Tokyo Marathon will be closed to all but elite runners. Organisers said the 38,000 general participants who signed up for the race on 1 March will not be allowed to compete, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters. Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesperson confirmed the UK government was in contact with the 74 Britons on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The government is trying to gauge interest in the possible repatriation of the Britons stuck onboard, Reuters reports. The US has evacuated 300 of its citizens and family members by plane from the quarantined ship in Japan. The state department said 14 Americans among those evacuated had tested positive for the new coronavirus. Here\u2019s some more information on the possible delay of China\u2019s annual meetings set for March. The meetings of the parliament, or National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), and the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) were both due to begin early next month. But both China\u2019s parliament and its top political consultative body are both considering delaying annual meetings set for March, state media said on Monday. Reuters reports: The gatherings see more than 5,000 delegates descend on Beijing, the capital, from all over China, for at least 10 days, to pass legislation and unveil the year\u2019s key economic targets. A postponement would be the first since China adopted the current March schedule in 1995 for the meeting of parliament. The standing committee of the NPC will meet on Feb. 24 in Beijing, the official Xinhua news agency said. \u201cThe upcoming session is ... expected to deliberate a draft decision on postponing the third annual session of the 13th NPC,\u201d it said. The session was due to have begun on 5 March. The proposal was made in the belief it was important to focus on reining in the epidemic, Xinhua said. China has imposed transport curbs to halt the spread of the virus, which has killed 1,770 and infected nearly 71,000 in mainland China. The CPPCC is also studying whether to postpone its annual meeting, state-run CCTV said, due to have begun two days earlier, on 3 March. Five people familiar with the matter told Reuters this month that China was considering delaying the meetings as Beijing grapples with the epidemic. The parliamentary committee will also consider a proposed law banning wildlife trade and discuss government changes, Xinhua said, without elaborating. Japan is bracing for the possibility of hundreds of additional cases of the coronavirus onboard the stricken Princess Diamond, after health officials said on Monday that a further 99 people on the ship had tested positive. The passengers already evacuated from the ship face further uncertainty too, with the US and Australian citizens set for a further two weeks of quarantine after arriving home. Hundreds of American passengers have flown back to the US and Australia said it would follow suit on Wednesday. The US state department announced later that 14 of the 340 American evacuees were confirmed to have the virus in tests given before they boarded the planes. They were taken to the US because they did not have symptoms and were being isolated from other passengers on the planes, it said. It was not immediately clear whether the 14 were among the 99 new cases. Onboard the Diamond Princess, 454 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 out of an original total of about 3,600 passengers and crew. Japan\u2019s health ministry said it had tested 1,723 people on the vessel. Forty American passengers who were diagnosed with the virus on Sunday have been transferred to hospitals in Japan. Most of the people on the ship, which has the largest number of cases outside China, have yet to be tested. The health ministry will continue to test passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess, whose 14-day quarantine was due to end on Wednesday. Japanese public health experts advising the government defended the decision to isolate passengers and crew on the ship, even as the number of cases increased again on Monday. \u201cMany people are testing positive on the ship, but that is because we are testing everyone onboard, regardless of their medical condition,\u201d said Shigeru Omi, the chief director of the Japan Community Health Care Organisation. \u201cAnd 70% of those testing positive are not showing any symptoms at all.\u201d Omi said any disruption to this summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics \u2013 including the Games\u2019 cancellation \u2013 would depend on how and if the virus mutates in the coming months, as well as the effectiveness of the international community\u2019s attempts to contain the outbreak. \u201cWhether the virus is under control by the time of the Olympics is anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d he said at a media briefing in Tokyo. Omi conceded that tracing the chain of domestic transmissions not related to the Diamond Princes was proving difficult, but denied Japan, which has confirmed 65 cases on land, was becoming a second major infection cluster. \u201cOur focus now is on community-based preventative action to lower the speed of the transmission of the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is true that there have been silent transmissions, but Japan is certainly not in a state of pandemic.\u201d A Russian woman who was onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner docked in Yokohama, Japan, has tested positive for coronavirus, the Russian embassy in Japan said on Monday. Reuters reports the woman will be taken to a hospital and treated, citing a post by the embassy on Facebook. The woman is thought to be the first Russian national to contract the virus after the two previous cases found in Russia were Chinese nationals. Japanese officials have confirmed a further 99 people have been infected by the new coronavirus aboard the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, bringing the total to 454, the health ministry said on Monday. AP reports: The ministry has been carrying out tests on passengers and crew on the ship, docked in Yokohama, a port city near Tokyo. The 14-day quarantine for those on the ship was due to end Wednesday. Outside China, the ship has had the largest number of cases of the Covid-19 illness caused by the virus that emerged in China late last year. Japan will close next month\u2019s Tokyo Marathon to all but elite professional runners. Organisers of the Tokyo Marathon said the 38,000 general participants who signed up for the race on 1 March will not be allowed to compete, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters. The event will instead be limited to top-level competitors, which includes 176 elite runners and 30 elite wheelchair athletes. Japan would limit public crowds in Tokyo to prevent a further spread of the deadly coronavirus. Shares in some of the marathon\u2019s sponsors fell following the announcement. Seiko Holdings, the maker of watches and clocks, slid 3.5%, as did shoe and sportswear maker ASICS Corp. The broader Tokyo market was little changed. Japan also announced it would be scrapping the emperor\u2019s birthday celebrations. The last time the birthday celebration was cancelled was 1996, during a hostage crisis at the Japanese embassy in Peru. China says it might postpone its annual congress in March, its biggest political meeting of the year. The standing committee for the National People\u2019s Congress said it believes it is necessary to postpone the gathering to give top priority to people\u2019s lives, safety and health, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It noted that one-third of the 3,000 delegates are provincial and municipal-level cadres with important leadership roles working on the frontline of the battle against the epidemic. The standing committee said it would meet on 24 February to further deliberate on a postponement. The meeting is due to start on 5 March. I want to hear your news, experiences and questions about the coronavirus outbreak. You can email me at aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com or tweet me at @aamnamohdin I\u2019m particularly keen to hear from those who have booked a holiday to China, but are currently in limbo. Morning, it\u2019s Aamna Mohdin taking over the liveblog from my colleague Alison Rourke. Of the 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, 14 have tested positive for the new coronavirus, the US state department said on Monday. The American passengers disembarking from the Diamond Princess preparing to return home on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for Covid-19, the state department said in a joint statement with the department of health and human services (HHS). The passengers were allowed to board the plane, but were isolated from the others and would be monitored closely. The state department and HHS said in a statement: During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers. These flights departed Japan at approximately 4:30pm eastern time on February 16 and will arrive in the United States later this morning. All passengers are being closely monitored by medical professionals throughout the flight, and any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated. Upon landing in the United States, passengers will deplane at either Travis AFB or Joint Base San Antonio and will remain under quarantine for 14 days. Passengers that develop symptoms in flight and those with positive test results will remain isolated on the flights and will be transported to an appropriate location for continued isolation and care. Here are the latest developments: The total confirmed number of Covid-19 cases in China has risen. to 70,548, after the health ministry reported 2,048 new cases in its Monday update. New deaths totalled 105, bringing the total number of fatalities in China to 1,770. Of the new cases 1,933 were in Hubei province, as were 100 of the deaths. The US has airlifted its citizens stuck on the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan. Forty Americans were tested positive remain in the country. A number of other countries, including Canada, Australia and South Korea have announced plans to evacuate their citizens from the stricken ship. (A Qantas plane will fly 209 Australians home on Wednesday). Xiaogan city, in central Hubei, has banned residents from leaving their homes in an attempt to curtail the virus. It has the second highest number of confirmed cases in China, after nearby Wuhan. Xinxian country in Henan province, south of Beijing, announced it is extending quarantine to 21 days for citizens returning from Wuhan, following two unusual cases of Covid-19. Singapore has flagged a possible recession as it cut growth forecasts because of the impact of the virus. You can read our latest roundup of all the days news on the coronavirus outbreak below. The Covid-19 outbreak has officially had no negative impact on the country\u2019s stock markets. After a huge 8% fall on the first day of trading after the lunar new year break, indices have fattened up again and are buoyed by the promise of stimulus from the central bank (see below). The Shanghai Composite was up 2.19% in afternoon trading while the Shenzhen Composite rose 2.84%. We\u2019re seeing a news conference now from the Australian city of Darwin, where authorities are talking about the 209 Australians being brought home from the stricken Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan. Those returning will be quarantined for 14 days near the northern city of Darwin. \u201cWe are not entirely convinced that the quarantine procedures on that ship were 100% effective,\u201d said Prof Dianne Stephens, deputy chief health officer for the Northern Territory (NT). About 150 of the 209 passengers are over the age of 60. Authorities said there will also be a number of older people and the concern for them is not about coronavirus, but co-morbidities, including diabetes, stress and cardiovascular disease. The Global Times \u2013 the tabloid mouth piece of the Chinese government \u2013 is reporting that the county of Xinxian in Henan province, south of Beijing, is extending the quarantine period for travellers returning from Wuhan to 21 days. This follows two unusual cases of Covid-19, which you can read about in the tweet below. This could obviously be very significant if this is replicated elsewhere. The Economist\u2019s correspondent in Shanghai, Simon Rabinovitch, has published a graph showing the infections in China outside Hubei. Just breaking down that flurry of speakers at the press conference in Australia ... one of the most significant things to come out of it for me was that the chief medical officer saying they are not sure why the infections on the Diamond Princess cruise liner are continuing to spread, despite the quarantine measures in place. Shares in China have posted strong gains after the country\u2019s central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending from 3.25% to 3.15% to try to cushion businesses from the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. The bank also injected another 200bn yuan of liquidity into the system. The move is expected to pave the way for a reduction in the country\u2019s benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday, Reuters reports, to lower borrowing costs and ease financial strains on companies hit by the epidemic. China\u2019s authorities have already loosened borrowing requirements and arranged special loans for businesses hit by the lockdown of millions of people. On Sunday, the finance ministry said it would roll out targeted and phased tax and fee cuts. The Shanghai Composite index of leading shares was up 1.4% and Hong Kong was 0.4% to the good. But the picture was less rosy elsewhere in Asia Pacific with the poor GDP data pushing the Nikkei down by 0.65% in Tokyo. In Sydney the ASX200 was flat. A reporter is asking about Australians onboard the MS Westerdam cruise ship that docked in Cambodia last Thursday. An American passenger on that ship was subsequently diagnosed with Covid-19, after testing in Malaysia. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne answers: There were some Australians on the vessel Westerdam. 39 of those have remained in Phnom Penh after the ship finally docked. They have been provided with hotel accommodation in the capital. Payne says they are being tested in Cambodia and results expect to be returned in the next 48 hours. Ten Australians remain on the ship, still docked in Cambodia She says the Cambodian government is making arrangements to test those people who remained on the ship tested \u2013 another 200 or so people. She says that will happen in the next two to three days. Scott Morrison made very clear that the decision has been made by the national security committee that: Any person who was onboard that ship, regardless of their nationality, if they seek to enter Australia within the next 14 days, they will not be granted entry to Australia. Brendan Murphy\u2019s, Australia\u2019s chief health officer, has the microphone now. He says he is not sure why there have continued to be further infections onboard the Diamond Princess ship. We are not quite sure why there have been ongoing infections, but given there has been recent cases, we cannot be absolutely sure that any of the currently well people on the ship who are coming home onWednesday are not carrying the virus. We cannot be sure. And if we cannot be sure we have to take precautions. And that is why we are going to take them to the HowardSprings facility in Darwin, which minister Hunt and I have visited, it is a very good quality accommodation facility and I can assure the families of those coming that it is a much nicer place to be for two weeks than a cabin. He says he sympathises with people who have already done nearly two weeks in quarantine on the ship, and who may not want to do another two weeks of quarantine, but notes that other countries have also imposed additional two weeks of quarantine, including Canada and the US. The Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, is talking now. He confirms Australia still only has 15 cases of Covid-19, eight of which have now recovered. He says the 242 passengers who were airlifted out of Wuhan on the first Australian evacuation flight out of that city, will leave Christmas Island today, where they have been staying for 2 weeks. Payne reiterates the decision to bring citizens home from Japan is based on medical advice. We\u2019re now hearing from Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne. She thanks the government of Japan for its co-operation during this process of getting Australia\u2019s citizens home from the ship, currently docked south of Tokyo. She also thanks Japan for the care they are giving to the 20 or so Australians in hospital in Japan who have tested positive for Covid-19. Morrison says they are contacting all the passengers on the ship and that New Zealand citizens on the ship will also be offered seats on the Qantas flight. The Australian PM, Scott Morrison, has announced Qantas will fly home Australian citizens stuck on the stricken Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan this Wednesday. There are more than 200 Australians on the ship. They will face a further 14 days in quarantine at the Howard Springs facility near the Australian city of Darwin. In Hong Kong armed robbers have stolen hundreds of toilet rolls, amid panic buying from stores as the coronavirus outbreak spreads. Toilet rolls have become hot property in the business hub, despite government assurances that supplies remain unaffected by the virus outbreak. You can read our full story here. Agence France-Presse has rounded up where the coronavirus cases are globally. ASIA-PACIFIC Cruise ship Diamond Princess, quarantined off Japan: 355, plus a quarantine officer. Singapore: 75 Japan: 59, including death of one infected woman Hong Kong: 57, including one death Thailand: 34 South Korea: 30 Malaysia: 22 Taiwan: 20, including one death Vietnam: 16 Australia: 15 Macau: 10 India: 3 Philippines: 3, including one death Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Cambodia: 1 NORTH AMERICA United States: 15 Canada: 8 EUROPE Germany: 16 France: 12, including one death Britain: 9 Italy: 3 Russia: 2 Spain: 2 Finland: 1 Sweden: 1 Belgium: 1 MIDDLE EAST United Arab Emirates: 9 AFRICA Egypt: 1 While we are on the economic impact of the coronavirus, New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said on Monday that the country\u2019s GDP is expected to slow to around 2% to 2.5% this year, due to the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic. Ardern said the forecasts were from the treasury which had previously predicted a GDP growth of 2.2% to 2.8%. She said the impact will be seen in the first two quarters of the year. \u201cTreasury expect things to return to normal in the second half of 2020,\u201d she told a news conference. Japan\u2019s NKH has reported new figures from the government that show GDP shrank in the final quarter of 2019 by 6.3% (on an annualised basis for October-December). NHK says it was the first contraction in five quarters. It was also the biggest fall since the consumption tax was last raised in 2014. Given that it\u2019s from last year, it\u2019s unlikely to be related to the coronavirus. But the figures show that the economy is already under pressure while it\u2019s trying to absorb the impact of the virus. Reuters is citing experts warning that the widening fallout the outbreak is damaging output and tourism in Japan, undermining growth and potentially pushing the country into recession. Meanwhile, the Tokyo Marathon organisers are considering restricting the number of general participants in this year\u2019s race as a precaution against the further spread of the virus. China\u2019s Global Television Network is reporting that Chinese residents are being asked to defer their participation in the event until next year. The marathon is believed to have more than 300,000 entrants this year. Just a bit more on the new measures in the city of Xiaogan, that confine residents to their homes ... on Friday, the state media outlet, Xinhua, reported that all residents in the city would not be allowed to exit and re-enter their communities or residential areas. Today\u2019s announcement appears to be a further escalation of this. Xinhua reported that \u201ccommunity committees\u201d would deliver daily necessities to residents and that buying services would be provided for urgently-needed goods. This is something we have also seen in Wuhan, with community workers delivering items to residents. Deutsche Welle\u2019s East Asia correspondent William Yang says the new restrictions in Xiaogan will begin on Monday. Yang also reports on a new initiative in eastern Hubei\u2019s Huanggang city, where residents with a fever or cough who report their symptoms will be awarded 500 yuan or $72. The city is the third worst affected in Hubei, with 2,831 reported cases of Covid-19 and 78 deaths. Chinese state media is reporting another city in Hubei province has banned residents from leaving their homes. In Xiaogan, population 4.8 million, in central Hubei, people who violate the order will be detained \u201cfor a maximum of 10 days\u201d, the Global Times says: The levelled-up measure in Xiaogan asks all urban residents to stay indoors and rural villagers are prohibited from loitering, visiting or gathering. Those who involved in the prevention and control of the epidemic should travel in accordance with the designated time and route. Those who violate the order will be detained for no more than 10 days. All vehicles including motorcycles, electric bikes, bicycles and tricycles are prohibited from driving on the road. Only vehicles for special purposes, such as ambulances, fire trucks or vehicles transporting daily necessities, can be seen out of the road. All the other vehicles without a permit will be held by traffic police, and drivers will face 10 days of detainment and a fine of 500 yuan if they break the order. Those who do not obey the traffic management rules may have their driving licenses revoked. The Global Times adds that pharmacies, designated supermarkets, hotels and markets are open, but need to \u201cstrictly control the flow of people\u201d and to record customers\u2019 temperatures. \u201cPatrol teams\u201d will monitor movements. Xiaogan is the second worst hit in Hubei after Wuhan, with 3,279 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 70 deaths. Xiaogan is about 70km from Wuhan. The economics research firm Capital Economics, has published some very interesting graphs which appear to show just how substantially activity in China has reduced as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The first graph shows road congestion across 100 Chinese cities in the weeks before and after the lunar new year, comparing figures from the four years to 2020. The next graph looks at daily passenger trips by the millions. Many economists use electricity consumption as a proxy for economic activity in China, which makes this next graph particularly interesting. And finally, the food wholesale price index, comparing 2017-2020. A fifth evacuation flight of Japanese citizens from Wuhan has landed in Tokyo. It landed at Haneda airport shortly before 7.00am on Monday, the Japanese broadcaster NHK said, carrying 36 Japanese nationals and 29 Chinese nationals, including spouses of Japanese. A total of 763 people returned to Japan from Hubei on the four previous flights, NHK says. Singapore has cut its 2020 growth and exports forecasts due to an expected economic blow from the new coronavirus outbreak, flagging the chance of a recession this year, Reuters reports. The country has reported 75 cases of the virus to date, one of the highest tallies outside China. The downgrade of its GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5%, from 0.5% to 2.5% previously, opens up the possibility that full-year growth could be negative, with the prime minister saying on Friday that a recession is possible. \u201cThe outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since the last review... In particular, the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to affect the Singapore economy,\u201d said the ministry\u2019s permanent secretary, Gabriel Lim. Lim said the impact would be most keenly felt in manufacturing, trade, tourism and transport, alongside retail and food services. Singapore is set to roll out a hefty package of measures to cushion the blow from the epidemic on its economy at its annual budget on Tuesday, with some analysts expecting it to plan for its biggest deficit in over a decade. The full-year forecast range for non-oil domestic exports was also lowered on Monday to -0.5% to 1.5%, from 0% to 2% previously. The economy had been staging a nascent recovery after recording its lowest growth rate in a decade in 2019 at 0.7% before the virus spread to the city-state in late January. The Australian government is working on a plan to evacuate its citizens off the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship \u2013 the largest site for Covid-19 infections outside of mainland China. The ship, carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew, is docked at Yokohama port south of Tokyo. 355 people have tested positive for coronavirus, including 16 Australians. Nearly 200 Australians are on board. The US has begun an airlift operation to bring more than 400 of its citizens home form the ship and into quarantine in the US. They face a further 14 days in isolation. Canada, South Korea, Hong Kong and Italy have announced flights home for their citizens and residents. Australia\u2019s national security committee of cabinet met late Sunday, and will meet again Monday afternoon, to formalise a plan to extract Australians from the ship. Meanwhile, the first cohort of evacuees quarantined on Christmas Island are set to leave the remote island Monday afternoon. The evacuees will be flown to capital cities across Australia and allowed to return home. They have spent 14 days in the immigration detention centre on the remote island, and will not be required to self-isolate at home. 271 Australians were evacuated to the island. None have tested positive for coronavirus. A second cohort will leave Wednesday. Australia has also quarantined 266 citizens and permanent residents at a disused mining workers village on the outskirts of Darwin. They remain in quarantine. No coronavirus cases have been detected amongst that group either. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion about how the figures are trending over the past few days, particularly as there was a big spike in the number of recorded cases of infections in Hubei province last Wednesday, when it changed the way it was recording cases to include people who had been clinically diagnosed with Covid-19, as well as those who had tested positive on a Covid-19 test. First let\u2019s look at the trend for infections inside China but outside of Hubei, since they changed the way they were counting cases. Sunday 16 February: 125 new cases excluding Hubei (1,933 inside Hubei) Saturday 15 February: 166 new cases excluding Hubei (1,843 inside Hubei) Friday 14 February: 221 cases excluding Hubei (2,641 inside Hubei) Thursday 13 February: 267 cases excluding Hubei (4,823 inside Hubei) On Wednesday 12 February, Hubei changed the way it was counting cases. That day the National Health Commission recorded 312 cases outside of Hubei. The daily national figures for China have been announced. It says the total number of confirmed cases have by 2,048 to 70,548. Total deaths now stand at 1,770, after 105 more deaths were reported in the past 24 hours. Of those new deaths, only five were reported outside of Hubei province (3 in Henan, and 2 in Guangdong). Of the new infections, only 125 were recorded outside of Hubei. China\u2019s ambassador in Australia, Chen Jingye, is giving an interview on Sky News Australia about the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThis is controllable. This is curable,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we have every confidence and capacities to win against the epidemic.\u201d He says the Australian travel ban on people entering the country if they have travelled to China is \u201cout of proportion\u201d \u201cThe situation here is ... inconsistent with recommendations from WHO,\u201d he says. He says he hopes the Australian government will take this into account when next reviewing the travel ban, due to expire on Saturday. He hopes restrictions will be relaxed. He\u2019s now being asked about the death of the whistleblower doctor, Li Wenliang, who died from the virus around 10 days ago. \u201cHis contributions is (sic) acknowledged,\u201d he says. Chen says the best way to honour his memory is to keep fighting the virus. The next question is about reports a speech President Xi gave on 3 February, in which he gave instructions to fight the virus on 7 January. His remarks were published by state media late Saturday. \u201cPresident Xi himself has shown strong leadership in this fight against the virus. He\u2019s has been personally involved ... giving orders ... and overseeing and guiding efforts throughout this outbreak,\u201d Chen said. Chinese state media is reporting that penalties up to life imprisonment can be handed out to people who sell face masks or goggles which don\u2019t meet national standards. Hubei province is tightening its restrictions on movement further, in an effort to combat the virus. About 56 million people are effectively under quarantine, including in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have started. New measures include broad instructions that residential compounds and villages be \u201csealed off\u201d from unnecessary visitors, with tenants\u2019 outings \u201cstrictly managed\u201d. Last week Beijing, a city of more than 20 million people, said anyone returning to the city must go into self-imposed quarantine for 14 days, or face stiff penalties. The World Health Organization says international experts in a WHO-led joint mission had arrived in Beijing and had had their first meeting with their Chinese counterparts. \u201cWe look forward to this vitally important collaboration contributing to global knowledge about the \u001dCOVID19 outbreak,\u201d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter. On Sunday, a spokesman for China\u2019s National Health Commission said slowing case numbers nationally showed that China was controlling the outbreak. But Tedros has warned it is \u201cimpossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take\u201d. Tedros also said the international community must \u201cuse the window of opportunity\u201d to intensify preparations for the spread of Covid-19 infections. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. The epicentre of the outbreak \u2013 Hubei province \u2013 has reported 100 new deaths in its daily update of figures on Monday, with 1,933 new infections. This takes infections in China past 70,000, and deaths to at least 1,765. We are still waiting for Monday\u2019s national figures and will bring you them shortly. Five other deaths have been reported globally. Outside China, attention has turned to the Diamond Princess cruise ship, stuck in Japan. The US has airlifted its passengers out, but around 40 Americans who tested positive to Covid-19, will remain in Japan where they are being treated. Here\u2019s a quick summary of what else we know so far: The US air flights carrying passengers from the stricken cruise ship quarantined south of Tokyo have departed Canada and Hong Kong have offered flights to repatriate their nationals and we are expecting a decision in Australia on whether it will also offer flights home to the 200+ Australians on the ship. The quarantine on the Diamond Princess is due to end on Wednesday, but there are questions about whether it will be extended A passenger from the MS Westerdam cruise ship, which docked in Cambodia at the end of last week, has tested positive to the virus, after flying to Malaysia with nearly 150 other passengers from the ship Taiwan has reported first death from coronavirus",

Mr Sabisky, 27, had no academic research of note to his name. From a well-off family, he hardly fit Mr Cummings\u2019 call for \u201ctrue wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole\u201d.</p> <p>It speaks volumes about the <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/no10-refuse-say-boris-johnson-21513879\" title=\"\">arrogance</a> of Downing Street that Boris Johnson did not immediately dump Mr Sabisky \u2013 or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/no-10-refuses-to-comment-on-pms-views-of-racial-iq\" title=\"\">disassociate himself from his views</a> which are routinely found in the darker, damper recesses of the internet. You cannot have such people in government unless you mean to give the impression that you agree with them. But someone in No 10 thought better. Mr Johnson\u2019s team had gone out of its way to back Mr Sabisky. When the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said Mr Sabisky\u2019s comments were <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/british-pm-s-ambiguity-on-race-and-intelligence-criticised-by-labour-1.4176395\" title=\"\">\u201cnot my views and those are not the views of the government\u201d </a>he was slapped down by Downing Street\u2019s press operation.</p> <p>Mr Sabisky, like Mr Cummings, has no formal training in the fields that they both claim to understand. Earlier this month Mr Johnson claimed that his government \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020\" title=\"\">will be governed by science and not by mumbo-jumbo</a>\u201d. Hiring this individual was evidence that this is not true. If Mr Johnson or Mr Cummings wanted expertise in genetics then why not ask a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamRutherford/status/1229440099550736384\" title=\"\">scientist to advise </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamRutherford/status/1229440099550736384\" title=\"\">them</a>? The reason is the prime minister\u2019s adviser is not interested in exploring the dilemmas presented by diverging fundamental beliefs or those informed by scientific facts. He is interested in weaponising such debates for political gain.</p> <p>Mr Cummings made his name by leading the team that won the 2016 Brexit referendum, writing that his opponents were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/15/dominic-cummings-blog-political-values\" title=\"\">\u201cgrotesque incompetents\u201d</a> who lost despite commanding the machinery of the state. He claims that Whitehall displays a groupthink so strong that officials strive for unanimity rather than realistically appraise alternative courses of action. He is looking therefore for <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2020/01/02/two-hands-are-a-lot-were-hiring-data-scientists-project-managers-policy-experts-assorted-weirdos/\" title=\"\">\u201ctrue cognitive diversity\u201d</a>. But if this were the case why did Mr Cummings hire someone in his own image \u2013 a privately educated rightwinger with no track record outside of politics who is dazzled by science but has a background in the humanities? Again, the reason is that this is all about pursuing a strategy of purposeful polarisation.</p> <p>Mr Cummings seems intent on building a press operation in Downing Street that can dismiss criticism of controversial political actions as partisan dissent. The press helped bring Mr Cummings to heel. It is also important that Conservative MPs, such as former minister <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolinenokes/status/1229419769893355523\" title=\"\">Caroline No</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolinenokes/status/1229419769893355523\" title=\"\">kes</a> spoke out. Without such voices, Mr Cummings will be able to break traditional ethical boundaries. We are already seeing this with the \u201cdelay-and-deflect\u201d tactics to questions about who paid for the prime minister\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51493842\" title=\"\">\u00a315,000 Caribbean holiday</a>. Mr Cummings is no uniter. He is a divider. He wants to build a political stronghold with aggressive polarising strategies \u2013 on cultural, scientific and economic grounds \u2013 to strengthen allies and weaken opponents. The growing evidence is that Mr Johnson keeps Mr Cummings close because, while he wants to maintain the rhetorical pretence of <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-01-31/boris-johnson-promises-to-bring-country-together-on-brexit-day/\" title=\"\">\u201cbringing the country together\u201d</a>, he in fact intends to pursue a cynical politics of provocation and division. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Dominic Cummings, the chief special adviser to the prime minister, thinks the answer to Britain\u2019s problems is hiring brilliant people to work outside of bureaucratic constraints. He may be right, but not if one of his first hires as a \u201cweirdo and misfit\u201d to join him in No 10 is anything to go by. Andrew Sabisky quit after it emerged he was not a wunderkind but a rightwing provocateur who promoted ideas about eugenics cloaked in the sham argument that this is hard science. Mr Sabisky, 27, had no academic research of note to his name. From a well-off family, he hardly fit Mr Cummings\u2019 call for \u201ctrue wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole\u201d. It speaks volumes about the arrogance of Downing Street that Boris Johnson did not immediately dump Mr Sabisky \u2013 or even disassociate himself from his views which are routinely found in the darker, damper recesses of the internet. You cannot have such people in government unless you mean to give the impression that you agree with them. But someone in No 10 thought better. Mr Johnson\u2019s team had gone out of its way to back Mr Sabisky. When the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said Mr Sabisky\u2019s comments were \u201cnot my views and those are not the views of the government\u201d he was slapped down by Downing Street\u2019s press operation. Mr Sabisky, like Mr Cummings, has no formal training in the fields that they both claim to understand. Earlier this month Mr Johnson claimed that his government \u201cwill be governed by science and not by mumbo-jumbo\u201d. Hiring this individual was evidence that this is not true. If Mr Johnson or Mr Cummings wanted expertise in genetics then why not ask a scientist to advise them? The reason is the prime minister\u2019s adviser is not interested in exploring the dilemmas presented by diverging fundamental beliefs or those informed by scientific facts. He is interested in weaponising such debates for political gain. Mr Cummings made his name by leading the team that won the 2016 Brexit referendum, writing that his opponents were \u201cgrotesque incompetents\u201d who lost despite commanding the machinery of the state. He claims that Whitehall displays a groupthink so strong that officials strive for unanimity rather than realistically appraise alternative courses of action. He is looking therefore for \u201ctrue cognitive diversity\u201d. But if this were the case why did Mr Cummings hire someone in his own image \u2013 a privately educated rightwinger with no track record outside of politics who is dazzled by science but has a background in the humanities? Again, the reason is that this is all about pursuing a strategy of purposeful polarisation. Mr Cummings seems intent on building a press operation in Downing Street that can dismiss criticism of controversial political actions as partisan dissent. The press helped bring Mr Cummings to heel. It is also important that Conservative MPs, such as former minister Caroline Nokes spoke out. Without such voices, Mr Cummings will be able to break traditional ethical boundaries. We are already seeing this with the \u201cdelay-and-deflect\u201d tactics to questions about who paid for the prime minister\u2019s \u00a315,000 Caribbean holiday. Mr Cummings is no uniter. He is a divider. He wants to build a political stronghold with aggressive polarising strategies \u2013 on cultural, scientific and economic grounds \u2013 to strengthen allies and weaken opponents. The growing evidence is that Mr Johnson keeps Mr Cummings close because, while he wants to maintain the rhetorical pretence of \u201cbringing the country together\u201d, he in fact intends to pursue a cynical politics of provocation and division.",

Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s chief diplomat, announced that 27 foreign ministers had agreed to launch a new operation with naval ships, planes and satellites in order to enforce the UN arms embargo on Libya.

Had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/14/nan-goldin-review-marian-goodman-gallery-london-gut-wrenching-brilliant-beautiiful\">Nan Goldin </a>not already used it in her haunting audio-visual installations, the song would make a great soundtrack to this timely group show.</p> <p>Its aim, according to curator <a href=\"https://www.creativereview.co.uk/how-i-work-barbican-curator-alona-pardo/\">Alona Pardo</a>, is to explore how masculinity is \u201cexperienced, performed, coded and socially constructed\u201d in photography and film from the 1960s to the present. It\u2019s an ambitious undertaking, given the plurality of subversive masculinities that have have emerged since the 60s, and because of the resilience of certain forms of traditional ultra-male power, from the boardroom to the battlefield.</p> <p>In the first section, Disrupting the Archetype, the military looms large not only as a place of uber-masculinity, but also as a semiotic minefield of conflicting signals. What, for instance, are we to make of <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/thomas-dworzak/\">Thomas Dworzak</a>\u2019s cache of found studio photographs of young Taliban fighters, some holding hands amid ornate arrangements of flowers, their eyes rimmed with black kohl, their heads framed by brightly coloured, hand-painted haloes? The codes are so complex that, were it not for the occasional artfully placed AK-47, one would assume that these posed portraits were evidence of an ultra-clandestine gay culture in Afghanistan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7cad0f8b2d0c0da822e1357be8288a35256bcfc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cad0f8b2d0c0da822e1357be8288a35256bcfc1/134_96_4332_2598/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of Thomas Dworzak\u2019s images of Taliban fighters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conflicting signals \u2026 Images of Taliban fighters from Thomas Dworzak\u2019s found studio photographs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: T Dworzak/Magnum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the opposite wall, <a href=\"https://www.jackshainman.com/artists/adi-nes/\">Adi Nes</a>\u2019s staged colour portraits of soldiers in the Israeli Defense Forces are also elaborately staged, but in a very different way. Nes evokes an atmosphere of relaxed camaraderie, the men resting, dozing, laughing and, in one instance, pissing together in the open air of the desert. Making reference to scenes from art history, Nes\u2019s soldiers are actually civilians acting out roles that \u201care all grounded in his own experiences as a gay Mizrahi Jewish man.\u201d For me, this makes them not only unconvincing but disappointing \u2013 the artifice somehow undermining a masculinist subtext that would have been as evident, and more subversive, had he used a more straightforward documentary approach.</p> <p>In further contrast, photographs from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/09/photography\">Catherine Opie</a>\u2019s recent series High School Football appear to be staged, but are, in fact, complex portraits of image-savvy adolescent athletes who know exactly how they ought to look for the magazine spreads that may follow if they make it to the big league.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2659c6d4b529336bc0bf27762043917eeec7dcab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2659c6d4b529336bc0bf27762043917eeec7dcab/0_0_2250_3000/750.jpg\" alt=\"Rusty, 2008.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Knowing looks \u2026 Rusty, 2008, from the Catherine Opie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Catherine Opie, courtesy Regen Projects, Los Angeles and Thomas Dane Gallery, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Several versions of the subversive female gaze are present. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/17/artist-collier-schorr\">Collier Schorr</a> and <a href=\"http://www.1000wordsmag.com/sam-contis/\">Sam Contis </a>tackle the enduring archetype of American masculinity that is the contemporary cowboy. Schorr\u2019s teenage wranglers are both vulnerable and macho; in some places their portraits are placed on top of images of older African American men to make a rather too overt historical point. Contis\u2019s Deep Spring series, shot at an isolated all-male liberal college in the Sierra Nevada mountains, is evocative and questioning, the myth of the American west looming large in a narrative that moves deftly between the intimate and the elemental.</p> <p>Elsewhere, there are some powerful juxtapositions. A section mischievously titled Male Order pits a wall of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/02/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\">Richard Avedon</a>\u2019s austere, black and white portraits of post-Watergate US political figures \u2013 including presidents Carter, Reagan and Bush Sr \u2013 against a large grid of <a href=\"https://karenknorr.com/\">Karen Knorr</a>\u2019s quietly subversive, quintessentially English series Gentlemen. Shot in the early 80s in private gentlemen\u2019s clubs in London, Knorr\u2019s evocation of establishment male entitlement is acutely observed in often languorous portraits, one of which echoes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/jacob-rees-mogg-slouch-commons\">Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s recent bout of contemptuous lounging</a>. The accompanying quotes, all real, add layers of irony. \u201cMen are interested in Power. Women are interested in Service\u201d reads one above a portrait of a black man carrying a silver tea service.</p> <p>In the same room, there are two more darkly humorous takes on extreme masculinity: a wall of colour portraits of Hollywood Nazis \u2013 portrayed by Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, Clint Eastwood, Ronald Reagan, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy \u2013 by Piotr Ukla\u0144ski; and a vitrine containing a Clare Strand\u2019s tower of vintage Men Only magazines. It is not often you encounter the sublimely ridiculous and the ridiculously sublime in such close proximity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://festivalnumber6.com/jeremy-dellers-so-many-ways-to-hurt-you/\">Jeremy Dell</a><a href=\"https://festivalnumber6.com/jeremy-dellers-so-many-ways-to-hurt-you/\">er\u2019s So Many Ways to Hurt You</a>, a film portrait of the exotic Welsh-born wrestler Adrian Street, is a study in performative high camp of a particularly British variety, while an Andy Warhol film from 1979, Fashion: Male Models, comprises a series of deceptively straightforward interviews that cast light on the ways in which fashion conforms to, as well as challenges, traditional notions of masculinity. Neither quite prepares you for the brute primitivism of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/15/richard-mosse-incoming-review-barbican-curve-migrant-crisis\">Richard Mosse</a>\u2019s film Fraternity, which consists of young white men from Yale engaged in a guttural shouting contest for a keg of beer. Here, he who shouts the loudest also manages to shout the longest (which may yet prove to be a fitting metaphor for the Trump years).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a84caab00ee9e71a2ca02c6e16dcfc6d1ef927ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a84caab00ee9e71a2ca02c6e16dcfc6d1ef927ac/0_0_3937_4724/833.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Newspapers are no longer ironed / Coins no longer boiled / So far have Standards fallen\u2019 \u2026 from the series Gentlemen, 1981-83.\" width=\"833\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Newspapers are no longer ironed / Coins no longer boiled / So far have Standards fallen\u2019 \u2026 from the series Gentlemen, 1981-83.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Knorr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout, the exhibition moves between the conceptual and what might be called the intimate self-documentary. The most riveting examples of the latter occur in a section called Too Close to Home: Family and Fatherhood. Images by the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/30/ravens-masahisa-fukase-review-are-celebrated-photo-book\">Masahisa Fukase</a> are unmissable. Alongside playful but revealing portraits of his extended family are small, intimate, monochrome portraits of his ageing father that are almost overwhelming in their subtle intensity. In one, his dead father\u2019s face is outlined beneath a white sheet; in another, we see his father\u2019s bones after cremation.

      "bodyText": "In 1972, the French singer Charles Aznavour recorded What Makes a Man a Man. Had Nan Goldin not already used it in her haunting audio-visual installations, the song would make a great soundtrack to this timely group show. Its aim, according to curator Alona Pardo, is to explore how masculinity is \u201cexperienced, performed, coded and socially constructed\u201d in photography and film from the 1960s to the present. It\u2019s an ambitious undertaking, given the plurality of subversive masculinities that have have emerged since the 60s, and because of the resilience of certain forms of traditional ultra-male power, from the boardroom to the battlefield. In the first section, Disrupting the Archetype, the military looms large not only as a place of uber-masculinity, but also as a semiotic minefield of conflicting signals. What, for instance, are we to make of Thomas Dworzak\u2019s cache of found studio photographs of young Taliban fighters, some holding hands amid ornate arrangements of flowers, their eyes rimmed with black kohl, their heads framed by brightly coloured, hand-painted haloes? The codes are so complex that, were it not for the occasional artfully placed AK-47, one would assume that these posed portraits were evidence of an ultra-clandestine gay culture in Afghanistan. On the opposite wall, Adi Nes\u2019s staged colour portraits of soldiers in the Israeli Defense Forces are also elaborately staged, but in a very different way. Nes evokes an atmosphere of relaxed camaraderie, the men resting, dozing, laughing and, in one instance, pissing together in the open air of the desert. Making reference to scenes from art history, Nes\u2019s soldiers are actually civilians acting out roles that \u201care all grounded in his own experiences as a gay Mizrahi Jewish man.\u201d For me, this makes them not only unconvincing but disappointing \u2013 the artifice somehow undermining a masculinist subtext that would have been as evident, and more subversive, had he used a more straightforward documentary approach. In further contrast, photographs from Catherine Opie\u2019s recent series High School Football appear to be staged, but are, in fact, complex portraits of image-savvy adolescent athletes who know exactly how they ought to look for the magazine spreads that may follow if they make it to the big league. Several versions of the subversive female gaze are present. Collier Schorr and Sam Contis tackle the enduring archetype of American masculinity that is the contemporary cowboy. Schorr\u2019s teenage wranglers are both vulnerable and macho; in some places their portraits are placed on top of images of older African American men to make a rather too overt historical point. Contis\u2019s Deep Spring series, shot at an isolated all-male liberal college in the Sierra Nevada mountains, is evocative and questioning, the myth of the American west looming large in a narrative that moves deftly between the intimate and the elemental. Elsewhere, there are some powerful juxtapositions. A section mischievously titled Male Order pits a wall of Richard Avedon\u2019s austere, black and white portraits of post-Watergate US political figures \u2013 including presidents Carter, Reagan and Bush Sr \u2013 against a large grid of Karen Knorr\u2019s quietly subversive, quintessentially English series Gentlemen. Shot in the early 80s in private gentlemen\u2019s clubs in London, Knorr\u2019s evocation of establishment male entitlement is acutely observed in often languorous portraits, one of which echoes Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s recent bout of contemptuous lounging. The accompanying quotes, all real, add layers of irony. \u201cMen are interested in Power. Women are interested in Service\u201d reads one above a portrait of a black man carrying a silver tea service. In the same room, there are two more darkly humorous takes on extreme masculinity: a wall of colour portraits of Hollywood Nazis \u2013 portrayed by Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, Clint Eastwood, Ronald Reagan, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy \u2013 by Piotr Ukla\u0144ski; and a vitrine containing a Clare Strand\u2019s tower of vintage Men Only magazines. It is not often you encounter the sublimely ridiculous and the ridiculously sublime in such close proximity. Jeremy Deller\u2019s So Many Ways to Hurt You, a film portrait of the exotic Welsh-born wrestler Adrian Street, is a study in performative high camp of a particularly British variety, while an Andy Warhol film from 1979, Fashion: Male Models, comprises a series of deceptively straightforward interviews that cast light on the ways in which fashion conforms to, as well as challenges, traditional notions of masculinity. Neither quite prepares you for the brute primitivism of Richard Mosse\u2019s film Fraternity, which consists of young white men from Yale engaged in a guttural shouting contest for a keg of beer. Here, he who shouts the loudest also manages to shout the longest (which may yet prove to be a fitting metaphor for the Trump years). Throughout, the exhibition moves between the conceptual and what might be called the intimate self-documentary. The most riveting examples of the latter occur in a section called Too Close to Home: Family and Fatherhood. Images by the late Masahisa Fukase are unmissable. Alongside playful but revealing portraits of his extended family are small, intimate, monochrome portraits of his ageing father that are almost overwhelming in their subtle intensity. In one, his dead father\u2019s face is outlined beneath a white sheet; in another, we see his father\u2019s bones after cremation. Fukase\u2019s unflinching gaze reminds us that the ties that bind are tightest at the very moment when they are pulled asunder. Equally affecting in an altogether more conflicted way is Anna Fox\u2019s My Mother\u2019s Cupboards and My Father\u2019s Words, in which she juxtaposes \u201ccolour photographs of my mother\u2019s tidy cupboards with excerpts of my father\u2019s rantings\u201d. The tension here is between the formal beauty of these miniature pictures \u2013 shelves filled with pink china crockery and rose-tinted glasses \u2013 with the often grotesque violence of the intricately inscribed words \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m going to tear your mother to shreds with an oyster knife\u201d. I\u2019m still haunted by the unsettling nature of this work. In dramatic contrast is Richard Billingham\u2019s series Ray\u2019s a Laugh, full of extreme family drama undercut with moments of tenderness between Billingham\u2019s alcoholic father and feisty mother. No matter how many times I have seen these images, their power remains undiminished. This is family life in extremis; a dogged masculinity, born of necessity, fuelling even his mother\u2019s behaviour. Masculinities provides much to think about, from Ana Mendieta\u2019s subversive self-portraits as a man to Hank Willis Thomas\u2019s series, Unbranded, which uses American magazine adverts stripped of their text and context to illustrate the ways in which the African American experience has been commodified by corporate white America. Throughout, there are tropes and parallels \u2013 some intentional, some not \u2013 that reverberate across cultures and time. Thus, Karlheinz Weinberger\u2019s portraits of Swiss rebel youth in the 60s \u2013 all camp poses and customised DIY styles \u2013 have certain echoes with Hal Fischer\u2019s more conceptually mischievous 1977 series Gay Semiotics, a staged documentation of the sartorial iconography of gay communities in San Francisco. It is great to be reminded of how incisive Laurie Anderson\u2019s series Fully Automated Nikon is in the way it skews the casual sexism women encountered daily in 1970s New York, and how prescient was Marianne Wex\u2019s Let\u2019s Take Back Our Space, which nailed manspreading long before the term was invented.

      "body": "<p>My former colleague, Cuchlaine King, who has died aged 97, was not only a distinguished geomorphologist with a remarkable research publishing record, but a popular academic author and tutor.</p> <p>In 1951, Cuchlaine joined the geography department at Nottingham University, becoming professor in 1969. Her interest in geomorphology, the scientific study of landforms and landscapes, included beaches but particularly involved glaciers.</p> <p>At a time when scientific expeditions to remote locations were often closed to women, in 1953 she (with help from her father) persuaded a Nottingham undergraduate, <a href=\"https://carleton.ca/geography/people/jack-d-ives/\" title=\"\">Jack Ives</a>, to take her as a surveyor on a university expedition to Iceland to study and survey glaciers.</p> <p>Later in the 1950s she took part in the Cambridge expeditions on the Austerdalsbreen glacier in Norway. In the 60s she worked in Baffin Island, in Canada, again with Ives (by then professor of geography at McGill University, Montreal), who had to persuade the Canadian government to accept a female investigator in the field. Cuchlaine took for granted there was nothing her male colleagues could achieve that she could not, with no sense at the time of blazing a trail for others.</p> <p>She was born in Cambridge, the younger daughter of Margaret (nee Passingham) and William King, and educated at Francis Holland school in London, and as a boarder at a school in the New Forest.

      "bodyText": "My former colleague, Cuchlaine King, who has died aged 97, was not only a distinguished geomorphologist with a remarkable research publishing record, but a popular academic author and tutor. In 1951, Cuchlaine joined the geography department at Nottingham University, becoming professor in 1969. Her interest in geomorphology, the scientific study of landforms and landscapes, included beaches but particularly involved glaciers. At a time when scientific expeditions to remote locations were often closed to women, in 1953 she (with help from her father) persuaded a Nottingham undergraduate, Jack Ives, to take her as a surveyor on a university expedition to Iceland to study and survey glaciers. Later in the 1950s she took part in the Cambridge expeditions on the Austerdalsbreen glacier in Norway. In the 60s she worked in Baffin Island, in Canada, again with Ives (by then professor of geography at McGill University, Montreal), who had to persuade the Canadian government to accept a female investigator in the field. Cuchlaine took for granted there was nothing her male colleagues could achieve that she could not, with no sense at the time of blazing a trail for others. She was born in Cambridge, the younger daughter of Margaret (nee Passingham) and William King, and educated at Francis Holland school in London, and as a boarder at a school in the New Forest. Her father was a distinguished professor of geology at Cambridge University, and Cuchlaine went on to study geography at Cambridge, at Newnham College, graduating in 1943. She specialised in physical geography, learned topographic surveying, with an interest in beach sand movement, and completed a doctorate on the topic in 1949. Unusually for her generation, Cuchlaine was a prolific and assiduous writer of perceptive thematic geomorphological texts, becoming well known for her Beaches and Coasts (1959), Techniques in Geomorphology (1966) and Glacial and Periglacial Geomorphology (1968).

      "body": "<p>There was a point, quite early on in Andrew Weatherall\u2019s career, when vast commercial success appeared to beckon him. Already an acclaimed DJ and remixer, his production work on Primal Scream\u2019s 1991 album Screamadelica had helped turn a middling indie act whose career had given every appearance of being in its terminal phase, into an award-winning, multi-million selling band suddenly at the cutting edge, the epitome of the fruitful interface between rock music and the post-acid house dance scene.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/17/andrew-weatherall-british-producer-behind-screamadelica-dies-aged-56\">Andrew Weatherall, British producer behind Screamadelica, dies aged 56</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Others had worked on the album, including the Orb, and veteran Rolling Stones producer Jimmy Miller, but it was Weatherall who had spotted Primal Scream\u2019s potential to be something more than they were (he had penned an enthusiastic review of the band for the NME under the pseudonym Audrey Witherspoon), turned an overlooked 1989 album track called I\u2019m Losing More Than I\u2019ll Ever Have into Loaded, and propelled the band to Top of the Pops. There were moments when Screamadelica sounded more like his creation than the band\u2019s. If he could do this for Primal Scream, went the not-unreasonable thinking, what other remarkable transformations could he pull off?</p> <p>But record labels tended to balk when they discovered Weatherall\u2019s working methods. He expected bands to record something, then just leave him to do what he wanted. It was an approach that had paid dividends on Screamadelica, but as he laughingly protested, most musicians \u201cwant their record to sound how they want\u201d. Besides, Weatherall wasn\u2019t interested: \u201ca career in any business looks quite tiresome and vexing and like it might involve me having meetings with people I don\u2019t want to have meetings with \u2026 call me unambitious, but I was fine as I was,\u201d he reasoned, years later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"da209107e2c92bcb12dbc8d1ac99aa7eca52ccd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da209107e2c92bcb12dbc8d1ac99aa7eca52ccd7/0_242_2087_2606/801.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Weatherall DJing in 1994.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Weatherall DJing in 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Hutson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, he ventured off down a fascinating, serpentine and entirely uncompromising artistic path, conducted under an often baffling array of aliases, that took in everything from techno to rockabilly to a stint as Faber\u2019s artist in residence. He self-deprecatingly called it all \u201ca series of beautiful, totally futile gestures\u201d, but others begged to differ. His unbending idiosyncrasy earned him the nickname \u201cThe Guv\u2019nor\u201d; in recent years, he commanded such a degree of respect that he could curate his own annual festival in Carcassonne, France: it invariably sold out, despite the fact that Weatherall reliably populated it entirely with obscure underground artists.</p> <p>By his own account, Weatherall was something of a misfit from the start. The ranks of Britain\u2019s acid house pioneers were largely made up of old soulboys, but Weatherall was a fan of dub reggae and industrial music, who\u2019d been booked to play at seminal acid house club Shoom after its founder Danny Rampling heard him playing a Chris &amp; Cosey track at a house party in Islington. \u201cI went from listening to United by Throbbing Gristle to dancing in a field to Josephine by Chris Rea,\u201d he recalled of 1988\u2019s Second Summer of Love, \u201cwhich gives you some idea what a powerful drug ecstasy is.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, he quickly became an integral part of the scene, a member of the loose collective of DJs, producers and promoters called Boy\u2019s Own. The Boy\u2019s Own fanzine, which tended to take a wry, witty view of the acid house\u2019s saucer-eyed excesses, had Weatherall\u2019s fingerprints all over it \u2013 decades later, he could be relied upon to puncture any rosy-hued remembrances of the era by noting that when Boy\u2019s Own attempted to stage an Ibiza-like foam party, they did it in a cowshed, which resulted in dancers being engulfed with foam flecked with dung \u2013 as did the lyrics of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKJAhMAr8g4\">Raise</a>, the single he co-authored for the Boy\u2019s Own label under the name Bocca Juniors. Weatherall had briefly been a member of Genesis P-Orridge\u2019s Temple Ov Psychick Youth, which presumably accounted for the quotations from Aleister Crowley.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOBn50HHbRs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yOBn50HHbRs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Screamadelica, meanwhile, allowed him to indulge his musical passions on a grand scale: its centrepiece was his extraordinary reworking of their single Higher Than The Sun as \u201ca dub symphony\u201d, powered by former PiL bassist Jah Wobble. In fact, lengthy dub-inspired remixes became something of a Weatherall speciality in the early 90s, not least his reworkings of Flowered Up\u2019s Weekender and St Etienne\u2019s Only Love Can Break Your Heart. His audacious and brilliant reimagining of My Bloody Valentine\u2019s 1991 single Soon, which augmented the band\u2019s swooning guitars with a beat sampled from the Dynamic Corvettes\u2019 Funky Music Is the Thing, has been acclaimed as one of the greatest remixes of all time (\u201cthe young people seem to like it,\u201d was Weatherall\u2019s typically unassuming response to its legendary status).</p> <p>His next project, Sabres of Paradise, veered between a peculiarly haunting, occasionally eerie take on techno, blissful ambience and reggae; while an acclaimed accompanying club night, Sabresonic, hosted the first live performance from the Chemical Brothers. Weatherall\u2019s support of the duo, then known as the Dust Brothers, was instrumental in getting them a record deal.

      "bodyText": "There was a point, quite early on in Andrew Weatherall\u2019s career, when vast commercial success appeared to beckon him. Already an acclaimed DJ and remixer, his production work on Primal Scream\u2019s 1991 album Screamadelica had helped turn a middling indie act whose career had given every appearance of being in its terminal phase, into an award-winning, multi-million selling band suddenly at the cutting edge, the epitome of the fruitful interface between rock music and the post-acid house dance scene. Others had worked on the album, including the Orb, and veteran Rolling Stones producer Jimmy Miller, but it was Weatherall who had spotted Primal Scream\u2019s potential to be something more than they were (he had penned an enthusiastic review of the band for the NME under the pseudonym Audrey Witherspoon), turned an overlooked 1989 album track called I\u2019m Losing More Than I\u2019ll Ever Have into Loaded, and propelled the band to Top of the Pops. There were moments when Screamadelica sounded more like his creation than the band\u2019s. If he could do this for Primal Scream, went the not-unreasonable thinking, what other remarkable transformations could he pull off? But record labels tended to balk when they discovered Weatherall\u2019s working methods. He expected bands to record something, then just leave him to do what he wanted. It was an approach that had paid dividends on Screamadelica, but as he laughingly protested, most musicians \u201cwant their record to sound how they want\u201d. Besides, Weatherall wasn\u2019t interested: \u201ca career in any business looks quite tiresome and vexing and like it might involve me having meetings with people I don\u2019t want to have meetings with \u2026 call me unambitious, but I was fine as I was,\u201d he reasoned, years later. Instead, he ventured off down a fascinating, serpentine and entirely uncompromising artistic path, conducted under an often baffling array of aliases, that took in everything from techno to rockabilly to a stint as Faber\u2019s artist in residence. He self-deprecatingly called it all \u201ca series of beautiful, totally futile gestures\u201d, but others begged to differ. His unbending idiosyncrasy earned him the nickname \u201cThe Guv\u2019nor\u201d; in recent years, he commanded such a degree of respect that he could curate his own annual festival in Carcassonne, France: it invariably sold out, despite the fact that Weatherall reliably populated it entirely with obscure underground artists. By his own account, Weatherall was something of a misfit from the start. The ranks of Britain\u2019s acid house pioneers were largely made up of old soulboys, but Weatherall was a fan of dub reggae and industrial music, who\u2019d been booked to play at seminal acid house club Shoom after its founder Danny Rampling heard him playing a Chris &amp; Cosey track at a house party in Islington. \u201cI went from listening to United by Throbbing Gristle to dancing in a field to Josephine by Chris Rea,\u201d he recalled of 1988\u2019s Second Summer of Love, \u201cwhich gives you some idea what a powerful drug ecstasy is.\u201d Nevertheless, he quickly became an integral part of the scene, a member of the loose collective of DJs, producers and promoters called Boy\u2019s Own. The Boy\u2019s Own fanzine, which tended to take a wry, witty view of the acid house\u2019s saucer-eyed excesses, had Weatherall\u2019s fingerprints all over it \u2013 decades later, he could be relied upon to puncture any rosy-hued remembrances of the era by noting that when Boy\u2019s Own attempted to stage an Ibiza-like foam party, they did it in a cowshed, which resulted in dancers being engulfed with foam flecked with dung \u2013 as did the lyrics of Raise, the single he co-authored for the Boy\u2019s Own label under the name Bocca Juniors. Weatherall had briefly been a member of Genesis P-Orridge\u2019s Temple Ov Psychick Youth, which presumably accounted for the quotations from Aleister Crowley. Screamadelica, meanwhile, allowed him to indulge his musical passions on a grand scale: its centrepiece was his extraordinary reworking of their single Higher Than The Sun as \u201ca dub symphony\u201d, powered by former PiL bassist Jah Wobble. In fact, lengthy dub-inspired remixes became something of a Weatherall speciality in the early 90s, not least his reworkings of Flowered Up\u2019s Weekender and St Etienne\u2019s Only Love Can Break Your Heart. His audacious and brilliant reimagining of My Bloody Valentine\u2019s 1991 single Soon, which augmented the band\u2019s swooning guitars with a beat sampled from the Dynamic Corvettes\u2019 Funky Music Is the Thing, has been acclaimed as one of the greatest remixes of all time (\u201cthe young people seem to like it,\u201d was Weatherall\u2019s typically unassuming response to its legendary status). His next project, Sabres of Paradise, veered between a peculiarly haunting, occasionally eerie take on techno, blissful ambience and reggae; while an acclaimed accompanying club night, Sabresonic, hosted the first live performance from the Chemical Brothers. Weatherall\u2019s support of the duo, then known as the Dust Brothers, was instrumental in getting them a record deal. Sabres of Paradise\u2019s single Smokebelch II, based on an obscure track from LB Bad\u2019s album The True Story of House Music, became a perennial chillout classic that found its way onto umpteen compilation albums and soundtracks, but Weatherall pulled the plug on the project after three albums: not for the first time, it was hard to avoid the impression that he was deliberately short-circuiting something before it became too big. From that point on, Weatherall operated almost exclusively on the musical fringes, bemused by the fact that some of his peers had taken a more straightforward path and gone on to become superstar DJs: \u201cI thought DJs? Heroes? Are people really that desperate? I know people need heroes, but seriously, this is ridiculous.\u201d Among a plethora of subsequent projects, he made a series of beautifully understated house records with Keith Tenniswood under the name Two Lone Swordsmen; explored mid-tempo electronica as the Asphodells; compiled an album of early 80s post-punk, Nine O\u2019Clock Drop, that presaged a vast revival of interest in that genre; produced the second album by electronic duo Fuck Buttons to vast acclaim; and formed a drum-machine driven rockabilly band with himself as lead vocalist to widespread bafflement. Throughout, he continued to run club nights (A Love From Outer Space insisted that no DJ play a record any faster than 122 BPM), helm a succession of independent record labels, and release remixes that displayed an unerring ability to get inside a song, retaining or even amplifying its essence no matter how much he chose to alter the original.

      "bodyText": "The UK government is scrambling to contact scores of British travellers who disembarked from a cruise ship in Cambodia, after one of the passengers onboard later tested positive for coronavirus. Experts have raised concerns over the handling of the MS Westerdam\u2019s passengers as they departed the ship on Friday, and warned that hundreds of people who may have been exposed to the Covid-19 virus have now scattered around the world. Five countries refused entry to the ship, despite there being no confirmed cases onboard at the time, before Cambodia allowed it to dock. As passengers disembarked, they were greeted with hugs and handshakes from the country\u2019s prime minister, Hun Sen, an ally of China who has downplayed the threat posed by the virus. The cruise ship\u2019s operator, Holland America, said passengers were screened as they disembarked, though some have questioned if precautions were strong enough. Christina Kerby, a passenger on the ship, told Agence France-Presse on Monday she was surprised to be allowed on a tour of the Cambodian capital before being given the all-clear from the virus. \u201cI have young kids back home [in the US] and wouldn\u2019t want to risk infecting them or anyone around me if I am carrying the virus,\u201d she said. Mark Harris, a professor of virology at the University of Leeds, said there were suggestions that appropriate measures had not been taken. \u201cIf you have got people who are infected at an early stage they might not test positive, they might not show any symptoms but they could go on to develop full-blown disease,\u201d he said. But he added that Hong Kong, where the ship had departed two weeks earlier, was not a high risk. The Cambodian health ministry did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. Holland America said it was testing passengers who remained in the country and that results from a first batch of 406 tests were all negative. Hundreds more passengers have already left Cambodia, including 144 travellers who flew to Malaysia along with an 83-year-old American woman who tested positive for the disease. Holland America said it had shared passenger details with governments. The ship is reported to have carried 650 passengers from the US, 271 from Canada, 127 from the UK and 91 from the Netherlands, as well as some from Australia, Germany and China. After disembarking, all passengers\u2019 passports were reviewed to ensure no one had travelled through mainland China in the previous 14 days, according to Holland America. A spokesman for the UK Foreign Office (FCO) said officials were in touch with a number of British nationals undergoing tests and that it was not aware any had tested positive. \u201cOur staff are providing consular assistance to British nationals in Cambodia who have travelled on the Westerdam cruise ship and are working with the operator to establish contact with those who have recently disembarked. We encourage all British nationals who require consular support to contact us on +44 207 008 1500,\u201d the FCO said in a statement. It is not clear if travellers will be requested to self-isolate once they return home, though some experts have recommended taking such precautions. \u201cI think now, given that there is a confirmed case that is suspected to have acquired infection on board the ship, the other passengers should be asked to quarantine themselves at home and alert health authorities if they develop fever or respiratory symptoms within the 14 days since disembarkation,\u201d Prof Benjamin Cowling, from the school of public health at Hong Kong University, told AFP. On Monday, Cambodian officials offered passengers a free bus tour of Phnom Penh\u2019s sights, including the front of the royal palace. The country\u2019s response to the virus is a stark contrast to that of Thailand and Malaysia, which said foreign nationals who were passengers of the cruise ship would not be allowed entry. One passenger, Diana Walker Neve, said she had tested negative for the virus and had been able to leave a hotel where many passengers were staying. \u201cYesterday we were pretty much trying to be confined but now we know we were in the first group to be tested and [the results] came back negative, we can move about and not endanger anyone.\u201d She praised Holland America\u2019s handling of the situation but said it remained unclear when she and her family might be able to return home. David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said researchers did not yet have enough information about the ease with which the virus transmits. The question, he added, was whether \u201cthe countries where [departing passengers] go have the proper surveillance systems in places to detect and test those people should they develop any kind of a fever or any signs or symptoms of a respiratory infection?\u201d Cambodia has so far identified one case of coronavirus, a figure that research by Harvard University academics suggested was below what might be expected.",

First throwing open the door to a previously unthinkable possibility \u2013 immediate, concrete plans to fight the crisis, far beyond anything proposed by the inadequate Paris Agreement \u2013 and then, just as quickly, slamming that door shut. Perhaps even more tightly than before, given Johnson\u2019s disinterest in all things climate-related. And because now the party without an apparent serious climate plan is in charge of taking the critical first steps towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\" title=\"\">Theresa May\u2019s government\u2019s goal of hitting net-zero by 2050</a>, while the parties willing to commit to action are shut out of power by the enormous Tory majority.</p> <p>The climate assembly \u2013 which met for the second time in Birmingham last weekend \u2013 was created to act as a kind of workaround for traditional partisan deadlock, and to chart a safe route forward for governments to act on the climate crisis. Its conceit is that it offers direct access to the real will of the people: 110 citizens \u2013 chosen to be representative of the British population \u2013 attend sessions where they are briefed by experts on the issue; they then come up with a set of policies to solve it. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/citizens-assembly-ireland-abortion-referendum\" title=\"\">citizens\u2019 assembly in Ireland</a> helped the government to put forward the referendum that ended that country\u2019s abortion ban last year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The best chance for tackling the climate crisis comes from politicians and parties who don\u2019t wait for incremental solutions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The mood at the assembly so far has been hopeful. The setup assumes that our political leaders have the best intentions, but are paralysed by indecision, both because of the unfathomable number of options and the fear that the public will punish them for the wrong choice. The whole function of politics here is outsourced to the public: they\u2019re asked to make their own tough decisions. And so they have sat attentively listening to presentations on the greatest hits of never-tried climate policy, and have been asked to weigh them up. There was mention of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/07/personal-carbon-trading\" title=\"\">personal carbon allowances</a> (be your own carbon market), a very popular idea in 2008, and more recent schemes such as creating nationwide repair networks, and forcing manufacturers to build goods to last.</p> <p>All the solutions presented reflect the mainstream of British climate policy over the past two decades. The experts put forward a fairly cautious mix of technocratic market incentives and regulation, with large spending programmes reserved for infrastructure projects. Still, there were signs that the assembly might take some bold decisions. The experts barely mentioned free public transport, yet were quizzed on it incessantly. And the members wanted to know who was most responsible for emissions, and how they could be made to pay. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/18/climate-crisis-seen-as-most-important-issue-by-public-poll-shows\" title=\"\">polls suggest</a> that public opinion has leapt ahead of the government\u2019s climate ambition over the past year, and it\u2019s possible that the assembly recommendations will confirm that.</p> <p>But even if the assembly puts the most progressive options in front of the government, there\u2019s still the sticky question of implementation. \u201cHow can we be sure the government will follow on our recommendations,\u201d an assembly member asked Labour MP Rachel Reeves, one of only three elected officials in attendance. She didn\u2019t have a good answer, but she could easily have told them it\u2019s not on her \u2013 she\u2019s only ever been in opposition during her 10-year tenure in parliament. The assembly\u2019s most valuable contribution may be breaking the deadlock between equally effective but controversial policies \u2013 a land-use carbon tax or a consumption tax, for example \u2013 although the Tories may well choose neither. The problem with how to tackle the climate crisis in the UK is not partisan deadlock, but lack of government interest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b8f50536208f4dff542629edc16d745f1c0d01f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b8f50536208f4dff542629edc16d745f1c0d01f/0_223_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the citizens' climate assembly listen to a presentation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The mood at the assembly so far has been hopeful.

Its decisions aren\u2019t guaranteed to sway the government from its prearranged course. The Irish assembly is held up as a model for its recommendations on the abortion referendum. However, it also submitted proposals on the climate crisis, from huge investments in peat restoration and public transport to a tax on agriculture emissions. The Irish government ignored all of these, in favour of what the prime minister, Leo Varadkar, called \u201cambitious but realistic\u201d policies to \u201cnudge people to change behaviour\u201d. Nudging people towards radical change is a depressing continuation of the managerial away-day optimism that has dominated thinking on the climate crisis over the past 20 years. One would have better luck trying to nudge a stream back up a mountain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/15/worst-case-scenario-2050-climate-crisis-future-we-choose-christiana-figueres-tom-rivett-carnac\">\u2018The only uncertainty is how long we\u2019ll last\u2019: a worst case scenario for the climate in 2050</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead, the best chance for tackling the crisis comes from politicians and parties who don\u2019t wait for incremental solutions. Party politics has become an unexpected laboratory for fusing climate policies to big, popular, social spending programmes \u2013 based on the model of a green new deal, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/03/economicgrowth.climatechange\" title=\"\">first put forward by experts in 2008</a>. Unlike a sitting government, opposition policy shops are a frictionless environment: ambition can be doubled and redoubled without pushback.</p> <p>And if the programmes capture the public attention, they are quickly copied by other parties. Labour proposed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/labour-manifesto-promises-1m-green-jobs-to-tackle-climate-crisis\" title=\"\">green industrial revolution</a> based on using the resources of the state to foster green industries, creating jobs and increasing living standards. This in turn pushed the Liberal Democrats to try to match the offer \u2013 remarkable for a party committed to the decentralisation of state power. In the US, the Bernie Sanders campaign is not only currently leading the polls to win the Democratic nomination with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\" title=\"\">Green New Deal</a> as a top-line policy, it has also pushed every other candidate towards embracing the idea \u2013 something that would have seemed impossible just four years ago. </p> <p>For a long time it has been assumed that public opinion is a barrier to climate action. But the climate assembly will likely confirm what the polls have been indicating for the past year: that people are now ready to move further and faster on climate action than the minimal effort shown by the government. If their advice is ignored or diluted beyond recognition, then maybe citizens\u2019 assemblies are an imperfect mechanism for the scale of change needed to tackle the climate crisis. Only a green new deal for the UK will do.</p> <p>\u2022 Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment</p>",

There was mention of personal carbon allowances (be your own carbon market), a very popular idea in 2008, and more recent schemes such as creating nationwide repair networks, and forcing manufacturers to build goods to last. All the solutions presented reflect the mainstream of British climate policy over the past two decades. The experts put forward a fairly cautious mix of technocratic market incentives and regulation, with large spending programmes reserved for infrastructure projects. Still, there were signs that the assembly might take some bold decisions. The experts barely mentioned free public transport, yet were quizzed on it incessantly. And the members wanted to know who was most responsible for emissions, and how they could be made to pay. The polls suggest that public opinion has leapt ahead of the government\u2019s climate ambition over the past year, and it\u2019s possible that the assembly recommendations will confirm that. But even if the assembly puts the most progressive options in front of the government, there\u2019s still the sticky question of implementation. \u201cHow can we be sure the government will follow on our recommendations,\u201d an assembly member asked Labour MP Rachel Reeves, one of only three elected officials in attendance. She didn\u2019t have a good answer, but she could easily have told them it\u2019s not on her \u2013 she\u2019s only ever been in opposition during her 10-year tenure in parliament. The assembly\u2019s most valuable contribution may be breaking the deadlock between equally effective but controversial policies \u2013 a land-use carbon tax or a consumption tax, for example \u2013 although the Tories may well choose neither. The problem with how to tackle the climate crisis in the UK is not partisan deadlock, but lack of government interest. A citizens\u2019 assembly can\u2019t change that. Its decisions aren\u2019t guaranteed to sway the government from its prearranged course. The Irish assembly is held up as a model for its recommendations on the abortion referendum. However, it also submitted proposals on the climate crisis, from huge investments in peat restoration and public transport to a tax on agriculture emissions. The Irish government ignored all of these, in favour of what the prime minister, Leo Varadkar, called \u201cambitious but realistic\u201d policies to \u201cnudge people to change behaviour\u201d. Nudging people towards radical change is a depressing continuation of the managerial away-day optimism that has dominated thinking on the climate crisis over the past 20 years. One would have better luck trying to nudge a stream back up a mountain. Instead, the best chance for tackling the crisis comes from politicians and parties who don\u2019t wait for incremental solutions. Party politics has become an unexpected laboratory for fusing climate policies to big, popular, social spending programmes \u2013 based on the model of a green new deal, which was first put forward by experts in 2008. Unlike a sitting government, opposition policy shops are a frictionless environment: ambition can be doubled and redoubled without pushback. And if the programmes capture the public attention, they are quickly copied by other parties. Labour proposed a green industrial revolution based on using the resources of the state to foster green industries, creating jobs and increasing living standards. This in turn pushed the Liberal Democrats to try to match the offer \u2013 remarkable for a party committed to the decentralisation of state power. In the US, the Bernie Sanders campaign is not only currently leading the polls to win the Democratic nomination with the Green New Deal as a top-line policy, it has also pushed every other candidate towards embracing the idea \u2013 something that would have seemed impossible just four years ago. For a long time it has been assumed that public opinion is a barrier to climate action. But the climate assembly will likely confirm what the polls have been indicating for the past year: that people are now ready to move further and faster on climate action than the minimal effort shown by the government. If their advice is ignored or diluted beyond recognition, then maybe citizens\u2019 assemblies are an imperfect mechanism for the scale of change needed to tackle the climate crisis. Only a green new deal for the UK will do. \u2022 Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment",

Far better to simply ask them to keep talking to you about it. There are no guarantees here, but denying these feelings does not work. To be with someone in this state is extremely hard. My admiration for those who do this voluntarily is immense. We should talk about suicide with compassion, not shame. This may be asking the impossible, and I know that my feelings about those I lost are not resolvable. But we can do better. Sally Brampton said in her memoir on depression: \u201cWe are simply defeated by the long, hard struggle to stay alive. When somebody dies after a long illness, people are apt to say, with a note of approval: \u2018He fought so hard.\u2019 And they are inclined to think, about a suicide, that no fight was involved, that somebody simply gave up. This is quite wrong.\u201d We are all avoiding the conversation that we need to have because it so painful. But the alternative is far, far worse. \u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist. \u2022 In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

Pope Francis closed the four-day summit last February promising that the Catholic church would \u201cspare no effort\u201d to bring to justice paedophile priests and the bishops who covered up their crimes, but so far he has failed to implement crucial reforms to canon law that would allow that to happen. About 190 bishops and cardinals attended the summit, where they heard traumatic testimony from people who had been raped and molested by priests, and about the indifference that the Catholic church\u2019s hierarchy had shown towards them. Anne Barrett Doyle, a co-founder of Bishop Accountability, which tracks clergy sexual abuse cases, said that while the summit did a tremendous amount of good by raising the profile of the issue, increasing media coverage of cases and encouraging victims to come forward, it had not led to a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy. \u201cBy that I mean \u2018one strike and you\u2019re out\u2019 for abusers, at least out of the ministry, and \u2018one strike and you\u2019re out\u2019 for enablers,\u201d Doyle said on the sidelines of a press conference in Rome on Monday. Three months after the summit, the Vatican established procedures for every diocese to report allegations of abuse and foster accountability for the actions of bishops and cardinals. In December, Francis announced that the rule of \u201cpontifical secrecy\u201d would be abolished in an effort to improve transparency in sexual abuse cases. While these significant steps prompted changes in some Catholic countries, in others there has been no impact at all. \u201cLooking at the dioceses, parishes and episcopal conferences in seven of the largest Catholic countries in the world, we\u2019re finding mixed results,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cBut what they all have in common is a sobering verdict on the summit, which is that it is still entirely possible today, as it was a year ago, for a bishop to knowingly keep an abuser in ministry or return him to ministry, and for neither one of them to suffer a consequence under canon law.\u201d In terms of the positive impact of the summit, Bishops Accountability found that 4,500 victims of clerical sexual abuse in France had come forward over the past year, while public cases in Spain had surged by 50% thanks to media investigations.

      "body": "<p>First Joseph Aidoo took Zinedine Zidane down, then Denis Su\u00e1rez and Santi Mina did the same to his defence. The first hit was harder but the second hurt more. There were 30 minutes left at the Bernab\u00e9u when everyone saw the Ghanaian tumble off the pitch and crash into the Real Madrid manager, knocking him to the floor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marca/status/1229156809757339650?s=20\">and giving him a bloody lip</a>; there were four minutes left when the Galician saw something none of them had, except the man born in the same province a month earlier. And before anyone knew it, so swift and smooth, via some hidden portal, the ball was in the net. Neither of them had started the game, but Su\u00e1rez and Mina had ended it: 1-0 up, 2-1 down, it was now 2-2 and it was done.</p> \n<p>High in the north-eastern corner, way, way above the pitch, 700 Celta de Vigo fans <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tsf_podcast/status/1229127763770122243?s=20\">went wild</a>. \u201cThey\u2019ve been with us since we woke from our <em>siesta</em>,\u201d said Iago Aspas. They had followed the team from the hotel to the ground. It was almost 11pm now, and they weren\u2019t going anywhere. The players headed to the dressing room and then back out again, leaping about in front of them, singing. It was a wonder some of them could still stand; at the full-time whistle, there had been bodies lying everywhere, exhausted. It was only a draw, sure, but here, where they hadn\u2019t won in 13 years, this was big. \u201cOne small point, one giant leap,\u201d El Faro de Vigo called it. Enough to take them out of the relegation zone, believing they could actually survive.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/17/saul-niguez-atletico-madrid-liverpool-champions-league\">Atl\u00e9tico's Sa\u00fal N\u00edguez: 'We know how we can hurt Liverpool' | Sid Lowe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One pass did it. Well, two. And if the first was brilliant, Aspas slipping the ball through the gap for Fedor Smolov to open the scoring after seven minutes, the second was barely believable. Not least because this time there was no gap to slip it through. \u201cPhenomenal,\u201d Zidane called it, hand still gently rubbing a bruised lip. \u201cMagnificent\u201d, said Emilio Butrague\u00f1o. And they\u2019re the men it hurt. Not so much <em>a</em> pass as <em>the</em> pass, impossible to see before it happened and almost as hard <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1229333723486793729?s=20\">to work out after</a>.</p> \n<p>There were <em>10</em> men between Su\u00e1rez and goal, all bar Thibaut Courtois within a 10-yard strip, when he sent Sergio Ramos \u2013 the furthest forward \u2013 bumbling off in the other direction, turned and, with the outside of his foot, somehow flicked a way through Ramos, Dani Carvajal, Rapha\u00ebl Varane, Marcelo, Fede Valverde, Casemiro, Ferland Mendy, Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior for Mina.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey have a lot of quality, they showed that on the goal,\u201d Courtois said, and that was part of the point: the pass (passes) was (were) a glimpse of what they have. \u201cThey\u2019re better than their league position suggests,\u201d Zidane said, which they really should be. This is a team with Rafinha \u2013 astonishing here, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Thiago6/status/1229163485550063616?s=20\">delighting his brother</a> \u2013 Fran Beltr\u00e1n, Brais M\u00e9ndez, Mina, Pione Sisto, Su\u00e1rez, Gabriel Fern\u00e1ndez, and Aspas. One whose salary cap stands at \u20ac68.3m, almost twice the size of Mallorca, Valladolid and Granada, and ahead of 10 teams. It\u2019s also a team with identity, commitment and shared ideals. That, at least, is the theory.</p> \n<p>Club captain Hugo Mallo is the guy who went to a Galician derby on the bus with a supporters\u2019 club, standing in the away end wearing a hood and dark glasses and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/mar/18/celta-vigo-deportivo-la-coruna-mallo-aspas\">gesturing to Depor fans</a> to come and have a go if they think they\u2019re hard enough. The team captain, Aspas, is a Celta fan, <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/espn-fc-united/68/post/2630720/iago-aspas-the-talisman-of-celta-vigo\">youth teamer</a>, quite probably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/11/iago-aspas-that-corner-is-liverpool-fans-lasting-image-of-me-but-you-cant-live-in-the-past\">their best player ever</a> and the guy whose mum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/19/iago-aspas-world-cup-credentials-barcelona-celta-la-liga\">wades into the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/19/iago-aspas-world-cup-credentials-barcelona-celta-la-liga\">r\u00edas</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/19/iago-aspas-world-cup-credentials-barcelona-celta-la-liga\"> for shellfish</a> and goes to virtually every game on the bus with a supporters\u2019 club. Nor is it just them: 11 players were in the club\u2019s youth system, 10 are from the province of Pontevedra.

All the more considering they were forewarned. After an abysmal run <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/18/fear-and-loathing-in-vigo-as-pathetic-celta-drift-towards-the-rocks-iago-aspas-football\">last season</a>, Aspas returned to embark on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/apr/01/tears-and-cheers-as-iago-aspas-returns-to-save-celta-vigo-again\">a one-man salvation mission</a> and when at last they got safe at the end he declared: this can\u2019t happen again. Those signings were supposed to ensure it didn\u2019t, but it did. Coach Fran Escrib\u00e1 was sacked in November with the team in the relegation zone and, internally, the unity that a Galician core was supposed to give them just didn\u2019t happen. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/17/lazio-cannot-hide-their-title-ambition-after-fighting-back-past-inter\">Lazio cannot hide their title ambition after fighting back past Inter | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u00d3scar Garc\u00eda took over, winning at Villarreal in his second game and there were signs of improvement, an approach more in keeping with the quality of players: closer, shorter, more technical. Slowly, he was recovering them, re-establishing and redefining relationships, challenging power bases. \u201cA lot of our work has been psychological,\u201d he says. Yet the reality was troubling, a battle, and results did not immediately follow. While they drew five of their next eight, although they lost just once since the turn of the year (1-0 at Valencia), they didn\u2019t win any. Until this weekend, Mina had scored just twice and only Aspas had more. Gabriel Fernandez, signed to replace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/26/maxi-gomez-in-uruguay-lift-up-a-rock-and-there-is-a-footballer\">Maxi G\u00f3mez</a>, had only started five games and scored just one. Smolov, signed in the winter window, had to replace him. \u201cHe\u2019s here to help us out,\u201d Aspas said.</p> \n<p>He has, too. So has Sisto, absent before. When Sisto was taken off against Eibar, he departed in a huff, \u00d3scar confronting him. \u201cHe should remember where he was before I came,\u201d the manager said, promising punishment. In 12 weeks with Escrib\u00e1, Sisto had played 71 minutes; under Garc\u00eda, he only missed one game, becoming a regular starter. The man who once went 21 days eating nothing but fruit without telling the club, convinced it would help him only to discover it didn\u2019t, Oscar thought he could help. \u201cPione is different, as a person as well as a player,\u201d the manager said and he was worth the effort. Last week, Sisto scored the 91st-minute winner against Sevilla, giving them a first victory in eight, their first at home since October. This week, he came on as a late sub with Mina and Su\u00e1rez, as Celta went for it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mina and Suarez were supposed to lead this project; at least they led them to this late point, a glimpse of the quality that was always there. \u201cThey were playing less but they\u2019re training well and I\u2019m glad they could help us,\u201d Oscar said. They needed that on a weekend when all the teams at the bottom, sides already showing signs of a reaction, picked up at least a point: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jan/06/espanyol-barcelona-draw-offers-hope-aberlardo-fernandez-la-liga\">Espanyol</a> drew 2-2 at Sevilla, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/23/javier-aguirre-leganes-la-liga-survival-espanyol\">Legan\u00e9s</a> were held 0-0 at home by Betis and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/aug/19/vicente-moreno-mallorca-eibar-la-liga\">Mallorca</a>, who sacked their CEO this week, beat Alav\u00e9s. It lifted them back out of the relegation zone on goal difference; more importantly, it lifted them emotionally, celebrated like a revival, an antidote to that fatalism. \u201cIt hurt,\u201d Zidane said; for Celta, it healed. Belief to go with their quality. \u201cFootball owed us one,\u201d Aspas said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e65bcea5ff3f6f04681047374abf40486180abf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e65bcea5ff3f6f04681047374abf40486180abf/0_0_3000_1934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wu Lei celebrates after scoring for Espanyol against Sevilla.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wu Lei celebrates after scoring for Espanyol against Sevilla.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cristina Quicler/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s tight down there: Espanyol and Legan\u00e9s have 19 points, Mallorca and Celta 21.

If we want to survive, we have to believe we can. This point is about character, never giving up. If you\u2019re not strong, you don\u2019t get out of there.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Talking points</strong></h2> \n<p>\u2022 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid got a 2-2 draw at Mestalla in a match El Pa\u00eds described as an \u201celectric storm\u201d, a lot more fun than their games have been of late. And now it\u2019s time for Liverpool, whose astonishing stats, Sa\u00fal says, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/17/saul-niguez-atletico-madrid-liverpool-champions-league\">are there to be \u201cbroken\u201d</a>. On Sunday, Atl\u00e9tico trained at Cerro del Espino, with Diego Costa back for the head table tennis and for the Champions League too.

      "bodyText": "First Joseph Aidoo took Zinedine Zidane down, then Denis Su\u00e1rez and Santi Mina did the same to his defence. The first hit was harder but the second hurt more. There were 30 minutes left at the Bernab\u00e9u when everyone saw the Ghanaian tumble off the pitch and crash into the Real Madrid manager, knocking him to the floor and giving him a bloody lip; there were four minutes left when the Galician saw something none of them had, except the man born in the same province a month earlier. And before anyone knew it, so swift and smooth, via some hidden portal, the ball was in the net. Neither of them had started the game, but Su\u00e1rez and Mina had ended it: 1-0 up, 2-1 down, it was now 2-2 and it was done. High in the north-eastern corner, way, way above the pitch, 700 Celta de Vigo fans went wild. \u201cThey\u2019ve been with us since we woke from our siesta,\u201d said Iago Aspas. They had followed the team from the hotel to the ground. It was almost 11pm now, and they weren\u2019t going anywhere. The players headed to the dressing room and then back out again, leaping about in front of them, singing. It was a wonder some of them could still stand; at the full-time whistle, there had been bodies lying everywhere, exhausted. It was only a draw, sure, but here, where they hadn\u2019t won in 13 years, this was big. \u201cOne small point, one giant leap,\u201d El Faro de Vigo called it. Enough to take them out of the relegation zone, believing they could actually survive. One pass did it. Well, two. And if the first was brilliant, Aspas slipping the ball through the gap for Fedor Smolov to open the scoring after seven minutes, the second was barely believable. Not least because this time there was no gap to slip it through. \u201cPhenomenal,\u201d Zidane called it, hand still gently rubbing a bruised lip. \u201cMagnificent\u201d, said Emilio Butrague\u00f1o. And they\u2019re the men it hurt. Not so much a pass as the pass, impossible to see before it happened and almost as hard to work out after. There were 10 men between Su\u00e1rez and goal, all bar Thibaut Courtois within a 10-yard strip, when he sent Sergio Ramos \u2013 the furthest forward \u2013 bumbling off in the other direction, turned and, with the outside of his foot, somehow flicked a way through Ramos, Dani Carvajal, Rapha\u00ebl Varane, Marcelo, Fede Valverde, Casemiro, Ferland Mendy, Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior for Mina. \u201cThey have a lot of quality, they showed that on the goal,\u201d Courtois said, and that was part of the point: the pass (passes) was (were) a glimpse of what they have. \u201cThey\u2019re better than their league position suggests,\u201d Zidane said, which they really should be. This is a team with Rafinha \u2013 astonishing here, delighting his brother \u2013 Fran Beltr\u00e1n, Brais M\u00e9ndez, Mina, Pione Sisto, Su\u00e1rez, Gabriel Fern\u00e1ndez, and Aspas. One whose salary cap stands at \u20ac68.3m, almost twice the size of Mallorca, Valladolid and Granada, and ahead of 10 teams. It\u2019s also a team with identity, commitment and shared ideals. That, at least, is the theory. Club captain Hugo Mallo is the guy who went to a Galician derby on the bus with a supporters\u2019 club, standing in the away end wearing a hood and dark glasses and gesturing to Depor fans to come and have a go if they think they\u2019re hard enough. The team captain, Aspas, is a Celta fan, youth teamer, quite probably their best player ever and the guy whose mum wades into the r\u00edas for shellfish and goes to virtually every game on the bus with a supporters\u2019 club. Nor is it just them: 11 players were in the club\u2019s youth system, 10 are from the province of Pontevedra. Their summer repatriation policy was consciously pursued, bringing back Su\u00e1rez, Mina, Rafinha and Pape Cheikh. In short, they\u2019re not the sort of team that should be in trouble. All the more considering they were forewarned. After an abysmal run last season, Aspas returned to embark on a one-man salvation mission and when at last they got safe at the end he declared: this can\u2019t happen again. Those signings were supposed to ensure it didn\u2019t, but it did. Coach Fran Escrib\u00e1 was sacked in November with the team in the relegation zone and, internally, the unity that a Galician core was supposed to give them just didn\u2019t happen. Quite the opposite, in fact. \u00d3scar Garc\u00eda took over, winning at Villarreal in his second game and there were signs of improvement, an approach more in keeping with the quality of players: closer, shorter, more technical. Slowly, he was recovering them, re-establishing and redefining relationships, challenging power bases. \u201cA lot of our work has been psychological,\u201d he says. Yet the reality was troubling, a battle, and results did not immediately follow. While they drew five of their next eight, although they lost just once since the turn of the year (1-0 at Valencia), they didn\u2019t win any. Until this weekend, Mina had scored just twice and only Aspas had more. Gabriel Fernandez, signed to replace Maxi G\u00f3mez, had only started five games and scored just one. Smolov, signed in the winter window, had to replace him. \u201cHe\u2019s here to help us out,\u201d Aspas said. He has, too. So has Sisto, absent before. When Sisto was taken off against Eibar, he departed in a huff, \u00d3scar confronting him. \u201cHe should remember where he was before I came,\u201d the manager said, promising punishment. In 12 weeks with Escrib\u00e1, Sisto had played 71 minutes; under Garc\u00eda, he only missed one game, becoming a regular starter. The man who once went 21 days eating nothing but fruit without telling the club, convinced it would help him only to discover it didn\u2019t, Oscar thought he could help. \u201cPione is different, as a person as well as a player,\u201d the manager said and he was worth the effort. Last week, Sisto scored the 91st-minute winner against Sevilla, giving them a first victory in eight, their first at home since October. This week, he came on as a late sub with Mina and Su\u00e1rez, as Celta went for it. Mina and Suarez were supposed to lead this project; at least they led them to this late point, a glimpse of the quality that was always there. \u201cThey were playing less but they\u2019re training well and I\u2019m glad they could help us,\u201d Oscar said. They needed that on a weekend when all the teams at the bottom, sides already showing signs of a reaction, picked up at least a point: Espanyol drew 2-2 at Sevilla, Legan\u00e9s were held 0-0 at home by Betis and even Mallorca, who sacked their CEO this week, beat Alav\u00e9s. It lifted them back out of the relegation zone on goal difference; more importantly, it lifted them emotionally, celebrated like a revival, an antidote to that fatalism. \u201cIt hurt,\u201d Zidane said; for Celta, it healed. Belief to go with their quality. \u201cFootball owed us one,\u201d Aspas said. It\u2019s tight down there: Espanyol and Legan\u00e9s have 19 points, Mallorca and Celta 21. Eibar, who have a game in hand, have 24 and Valladolid 26. \u201cWe look at the table, of course we do,\u201d Oscar said, \u201cbut we have to look at ourselves more. If we want to survive, we have to believe we can. This point is about character, never giving up. If you\u2019re not strong, you don\u2019t get out of there.\u201d Talking points \u2022 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid got a 2-2 draw at Mestalla in a match El Pa\u00eds described as an \u201celectric storm\u201d, a lot more fun than their games have been of late. And now it\u2019s time for Liverpool, whose astonishing stats, Sa\u00fal says, are there to be \u201cbroken\u201d. On Sunday, Atl\u00e9tico trained at Cerro del Espino, with Diego Costa back for the head table tennis and for the Champions League too. Over the other side of the pitch, meanwhile, Kieran Trippier continued his recovery too. There are hopes he\u2019ll be ready for Anfield. Meawhile, above them on the min pitch, another English defender, Charlie I\u2019Anson, was busy scoring a superb header to claim a late equaliser for Rayo Majadahonda. It sounded good from outside anyway, and it turned out it was. \u2022 Lionel Messi has a problem, but more solutions. This is no his longest run without a goal in six years, 32 shots rattled off without hitting the net, but what he doesn\u2019t take he does give. His assist for the opener in what ended up being a tense, nervous afternoon against Getafe was his sixth in a row. Griezmann scored that, Sergi Roberto got the second. \u2022 Get a load of this week\u2019s best goal, scored by Doctor Diego Cervero, who got a hat-trick aged 36 for Barakaldo against Xabi Alonso\u2019s Real Sociedad B in Segunda B.

      "body": "<p>Tom Erhardt, who has died aged 91, was in his heyday perhaps the most knowledgable theatre agent in the world.</p> <p>He was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the eldest of three sons, to Joseph and Cecilia Erhardt, and completed his education at Aquinas College in the city. He spent the immediate postwar period in the far east, serving in the US army.

On Monday, an inquest jury in Wakefield returned a conclusion of accident after a four-day hearing into Rocco Wright\u2019s death at the David Lloyd health club in Moortown. The jury heard how the child died after he was pulled from the water by his father at the leisure centre on 21 April 2018. After the inquest, Leeds city council said it believed the firm had breached health and safety laws and it intended to prosecute \u201cin the near future\u201d. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe death of a child in any circumstances is tragic, and we continue to offer the Wright family our sincerest sympathy. We will keep in regular contact with the family and ensure they are informed and supported throughout this next stage.\u201d The inquest had previously heard how Rocco\u2019s father, Steven Wright, had pulled the boy from the water after he had got into difficulties. He described how his panic grew as he searched for Rocco before he spotted him at the bottom of the main pool. He said his son had never got into the pool by himself and the inquest heard there were no witnesses or CCTV evidence that could explain how he ended up in the water. The jury found that the child had probably been under the 1.2-metre (4ft) deep water for more than two minutes. It was also told that at the time of the drowning there had only been one 17-year-old lifeguard on duty and that David Lloyd operated a policy that the maximum number of people in a pool that could be supervised by a single lifeguard was 50 people. David Lloyd\u2019s operations director, Stephen Brown, said this was a \u201cceiling\u201d figure and denied the company had a policy of employing young lifeguards because they were cheaper and said lifeguard staffing levels were for local managers to decide. David Lloyd issued a statement saying that health and safety \u201cis and always will be our number one priority.\u201d It said: \u201cThe week-long inquest which concluded today, found a verdict of Accidental Death and we are unaware on what basis Leeds City Council intend to prosecute.

That is good news for first-home buyers who are make up a greater share of buyers than at any time since the GFC. It also gives the Reserve Bank scope to cut rates again. One of the more interesting things about the government\u2019s new program to assist first-home buyers is it comes in at a time when they are already in the market in a big way: Indeed if we look at the growth of housing finance, first-home buyers are the big movers. Home loans in December for non-first-home owner-occupiers were 10.1% above the year before, investor finance was just 3.2% above, and first-home buyer home loans were up 31.2%: It is actually quite stunning how quickly overall home loans have grown in the past year.

And given the clear link between housing finance growth and house prices, this means the latter look set to keep rising for at least six months: The link between home loans and house prices is not just a national average but one that is clear in both Sydney and Melbourne: Such a surge brings with it a level of concern that once again we will see the market quickly fall out of reach of most, and especially first-home buyers. And while that is a warranted concern, it is worth noting just how far the market has fallen. While the value of housing finance in all states and territories except Tasmania and the Northern Territory grew over 2019, when we look at the change over the past two years all except Tasmania are below their recent peaks: It\u2019s when we look at the total value of home loans rather than the annual growth you can see how far below the current level is from the 2017 peaks, even with the recent strong increases: In March 2017 there was a record $22.5bn in new housing loans. By April last year that had fallen 26%. Even with the growth of the last half of last year, the $19.5bn loans in December was still 13% below that peak. The story of that period is the departure of investors. While total owner-occupier loans are just above where they were March 2017, investor home loans in December were still 39% below that level. And to a significant extent first-home buyers have filled the gap. In December the level of home loans taken out by non first-home-buyer owner-occupiers was still 10% below the amount taken out in March 2017, but first-home buyer loans were a stunning 63% higher. The Reserve Bank has been for the most part happy to see the recovery of the housing sector after falls in 2018 and early 2019 \u2013 but as with all things economic there is a good and a bad. The governor of the RBA, Philip Lowe, told the standing committee on economics recently: \u201cIn the last six months the increase in housing prices has been a positive development for household balance sheets. And because it is positive for household balance sheets it is positive for spending and positive for the economy and jobs. But we can have too much of a good thing.\u201d Of course the reason why housing prices continuing to rise would be too much of a good thing is that unless it is accompanied by similar increases in household income it makes for an unsustainable market. Essentially that is what happened in Sydney. If we use average annual male full-time earnings and 50% of women\u2019s full-time earnings as a proxy for household earnings, from the end of 2011 when the RBA began cutting rates to the middle of 2017, house prices in Sydney went from 4.9 times annual household earnings to 8.9 times.

Certainly this improvement in housing affordability has allowed first-home buyers to come into the market. A big part of this has been policies introduced in New South Wales and Victoria which saw reductions in stamp duty for first-home buyers. The federal government\u2019s first-home buyer policy, which came into effect only last month, will not have as much of an impact. It is limited to 10,000 first-home buyers a year \u2013 which is only about 10% of such buyers.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis has caused a spike in concern about the environment, a hit to the popularity of the Coalition and Scott Morrison and a drop in support for new coalmines, even among Coalition voters. Those are the conclusions of a poll of 3,249 Australians conducted by the Australian National University\u2019s Centre for Social Research and Methods, which found a \u201csignificant and substantial decline\u201d in the Coalition\u2019s vote from 40% in October 2019 to 35% in January. The poll, released on Tuesday, confirms the results of the Newspoll and Guardian Essential poll that a horror summer \u2013 in which Morrison chose to holiday in Hawaii during the extended bushfire crisis that claimed at least 33 lives and more than 2,000 homes \u2013 has significantly impacted his popularity. The lead researcher, professor Nicolas Biddle, said the ANU poll showed \u201cquite strong disapproval\u201d of the federal government\u2019s handling of bushfires and \u201cin particular\u201d with Morrison\u2019s performance. In a rating of confidence in party leaders, Morrison scored an average of 3.92 out of 10, a net negative score and a slump since he rated 5.25 in June 2019. Labor leader Anthony Albanese recorded a \u201csmall but significant increase\u201d from 4.87 in June 2019 to 5.04. Confidence in the federal government also declined, with only 27% of respondents reporting they were \u201cconfident\u201d or \u201cvery confident\u201d in it, down 10.9% since October. \u201cThis is one of the largest declines in confidence I have seen in such a short period of time,\u201d Biddle said. State governments enjoyed support from 40.4% of respondents. Labor was not the only beneficiary of voters\u2019 move away from the Coalition, with less than half of those changing their vote from the Coalition choosing Labor instead (44%), while the rest opted for the Greens (14%), another party (25%) or did not know who they would vote for (17%). Around half of respondents now list the environment as the most or second-most important issue in deciding their vote, up from almost 42% in October. The ANU election survey found a record number of voters listed the environment or global warming as their top concern, making it a vote-winner for Labor at the 2019 election, although it was outweighed by the economy, which weighed in the Coalition\u2019s favour. According to the poll, the proportion of people who said global warming or the greenhouse effect would have an effect on them increased to 72%, while those that rated global warming a \u201cvery serious threat\u201d has reached 33%. People in non-capital cities were less likely to see global warming and climate change as an issue or threat and more supportive of new coalmines compared with people in capital cities, but the ANU report found these differences \u201care a matter of degrees, rather than direction\u201d. Three-quarters of respondents reported being indirectly affected by bushfires, including having their holiday plans affected, being exposed to smoke, feeling anxious or having friends or family threatened by property damage. Exposure to the bushfires was associated with an increase in whether a person thought the environment was a major issue, Biddle said. \u201cMany Australians changed their views, though, regardless of exposure, with females and young Australians the most likely to be more concerned about the environment than previously.\u201d Some 37% of respondents said the government should allow the opening of new coalmines, down from 45.3% in June 2019. The poll found the greatest drop in support for new coalmines was among those who voted for the Coalition at last year\u2019s federal election \u2013 from 72% support in June 2019 to 57% in January 2020. Those who live in a non-capital city were far more likely to have changed their vote from the Coalition, with an estimated probability more than twice as large as those in capital cities (all else being equal) \u2013 21% compared with 10%. In a warning for the government, the ANU report noted the results suggested that changes in attitudes on climate change and coal \u201care not restricted to those who would not have voted for the Coalition in the first place\u201d. \u201cA disproportionate amount of the swing did occur outside of the capital cities, likely to be key battlegrounds between now and the next election,\u201d it said. The Morrison government is currently debating coal\u2019s role in Australia\u2019s energy mix. Moderate Liberals including Dave Sharma and Trent Zimmerman have argued the government should not back new coal plants in Australia, while the Nationals are exerting pressure to move beyond a feasibility study for a new coal-fired coal plant at Collinsville in Queensland. Labor MPs have sought to play down suggestions of a breakaway pro-coal group within the party. The ANU poll used a nationally representative sample and was conducted in the fortnight from 20 January.

      "bodyText": "The government has claimed it does not owe welfare recipients a duty of care over the robodebt scandal and has denied alleged debtors were placed under \u201cduress\u201d, despite admitting in court documents that some debts were based on \u201cfalse\u201d assumptions. As the Coalition refuses to provide its legal advice about the scheme to a Senate inquiry, documents filed in the federal court reveal the government has conceded that debts issued using tax office income summaries could \u201cnot be validly established\u201d under the law. But in the documents, obtained by Guardian Australia, the government argues it should not be required to pay compensation because social security law makes no mention of a need to exercise \u201cdue or reasonable care\u201d. While a federal court order striking out a Melbourne woman\u2019s debt suggested the government now considers parts of the scheme unlawful, its defence to a class action filed by Gordon Legal represents its first public statement conceding that it issued potentially thousands of debts that were not valid under the law. The debts considered unlawful are those in which Centrelink sought repayments from people based solely on the agency\u2019s estimate of a person\u2019s employment earnings, known as \u201cincome averaging\u201d. In these cases, Centrelink did not obtain payslips or other evidence that could prove a person misreported their earnings. In its defence to the class action, the Commonwealth admitted that in the case of the five lead applicants, income averaging was not \u201cthe same as their actual fortnightly income, and was not necessarily referable to or indicative of their actual income in any fortnight\u201d. And in such cases, the \u201cfortnightly income assumption\u201d relied on by Centrelink \u201cwas false\u201d, the court documents say. More than 600,000 debts have been issued under the robodebt scheme, which demanded people provide evidence to prove they did not underreport their income to Centrelink \u2013 which would led them to be overpaid welfare benefits. If they refused or could not obtain the documents, a debt was issued. Services Australia, which runs Centrelink, is currently reviewing how many debts were raised in this fashion after the government said it would abandon the practice. In its defence, the commonwealth also argued it held no duty of care in social security law and that its methods of debt recovery \u2013 which can include the use of debt collectors and garnishee notices through the tax office \u2013 \u201cdo not amount to duress\u201d, as claimed by Gordon Legal. \u201c[The government] denies that it owed the Applicant and Group Members the duty alleged,\u201d it said. The government said the [department] secretary was required by law to deliver services \u201cin a fair, courteous, prompt and cost-efficient manner\u201d and ensure \u201cabuses of the social security system are minimised\u201d. It opposed a \u201ccommon law duty of care\u201d because it claimed the intent of the law was to have decisions reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, not through \u201ccollateral proceedings in court for damages for negligence\u201d. The government noted that some robodebt recipients, including two of the lead applicants in the case, had made \u201cvoluntary payments in response to notices issued [under the act]\u201d. Gordon Legal is calling for money recouped from debts issued without evidence to be returned to welfare recipients, potentially with interest, and for compensation for the distress and inconvenience alleged victims suffered. The firm argues that people affected by the robodebt program were \u201cvulnerable to any unlawful or unreasonable exercise\u201d and had \u201cinsufficient resources, knowledge or capacity to question, challenge or demonstrate the falsity of the valid debt beliefs\u201d. The government recovered money from debt recipients under \u201cduress\u201d and should have foreseen that issuing and enforcing debts would \u201ccause significant concern, stress, anxiety and stigma\u201d and could cause \u201cfinancial hardship\u201d, the statement of claim says. The class action\u2019s five lead applicants Applicant one Issued a $4,399.13 Newstart debt plus $385.04 \u201crecovery fee\u201d in November 2016 based solely on Australian Taxation Office data Centrelink garnishees $142.54 through tax office; applicant pays $400 towards the debt Debt reduced to $2,905.03 (October 2018) and then $73.52 (December 2019) after further information provided to Centrelink Applicant receives $542.54 refund on 5 December 2019, shortly after Gordon Legal files papers in federal court Applicant two Issued $3,096.26 Newstart and Youth Allowance debt in March 2018 based solely on tax office data Centrelink garnishees $803.96 from applicant\u2019s tax return through ATO Debt is currently under review by Centrelink Applicant three Issued $4351.07 Newstart debt in December 2018 Debt varied after a review to $4,241.69 and a second debt added worth $1,896.91 Government says debts were initially raised using a combination of payslips and tax office data, but finalised using payslips and payroll data Centrelink garnishees $4,513.01 through the tax office Applicant four Issued $11,303.77 debt on September 2016 based in part on payslips and in part on ATO income data Debt increased to $12.720.72 after applicant provides bank statements to Centrelink Applicant had $20 a fortnight deducted from welfare payments to repay the debt Applicant five Issued a $2.602.65 Newstart debt in November 2016 based solely on ATO data Debt increased to $2,366.05 after a May 2019 review, but $236.60 \u201crecovery fee\u201d removed Centrelink garnishees $1,162.95 from applicant via tax office in December 2018 Debt reduced to $253.85 after applicant provides payslips for review finalised in December 2019 Refund of $903.37 processed in December 2019 Do you have a robodebt story? luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com",

To suggest that there\u2019s only one element to Tayla\u2019s game is fodder.\u201d</p> <p>On social media the North Melbourne great David King praised the post-game \u201cspice\u201d and the entire round of matches, which included some brilliant physical clashes, declaring it a watershed weekend. It\u2019s hard to disagree with his assessment.<br> \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of the AFLW competition, but I feel today was its finest day. All long-term, successful competitions need passion and often a little bit of hatred helps. It shows all just how much it means to the combatants when they speak with such spice. Bloody loved it!\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBloody loved it\u201d was a common reaction amongst fans, although some have labelled Livingstone\u2019s spray as rude and disrespectful. Obviously women aren\u2019t allowed to occasionally be those things.</p> <p>On Twitter, Harris, who is also a professional boxer, chipped in, replying simply \u201csame\u201d to a tweet from the broadcaster looking forward to a potential rematch between the sides in the finals. On Monday afternoon she posted an image of a prowling lion with the phrase \u201ca lion never loses sleep over the opinions of sheep\u201d. Mic drop.</p> <p>Livingstone has, probably wisely, back-pedalled a little since Sunday, calling her comments a \u201cbit of smack talk\u201d and saying she \u201ccould have chosen her words better\u201d. But she should be lauded for her honesty \u2013 something often lacking in yawn-inducing post-match interviews in the men\u2019s game \u2013 and for showing the fervour in the women\u2019s game runs deep.</p> <p>The competition will only benefit from such passion and pure humanity, two characteristics that drive a love of a sport, whoever is playing it. It\u2019s the stuff of column inches and talkback content and bar-stool debate. And if Collingwood and Carlton do meet in the finals, it\u2019ll be treated very differently than if Livingstone had delivered meaningless platitudes for 22 seconds, that\u2019s for sure.</p> <p>For showing women can be brutal, can have swagger, can be boastful and yes maybe even a bit rude at times, Livingstone has also done much for little girls watching at home. She shows girls and women don\u2019t have to fit in a box and don\u2019t have to play nice.</p> <p>Maybe Ulrich <em>did</em> mean women must misbehave to change the world, after all.</p>",

To suggest that there\u2019s only one element to Tayla\u2019s game is fodder.\u201d On social media the North Melbourne great David King praised the post-game \u201cspice\u201d and the entire round of matches, which included some brilliant physical clashes, declaring it a watershed weekend. It\u2019s hard to disagree with his assessment. \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of the AFLW competition, but I feel today was its finest day. All long-term, successful competitions need passion and often a little bit of hatred helps. It shows all just how much it means to the combatants when they speak with such spice. Bloody loved it!\u201d he said. \u201cBloody loved it\u201d was a common reaction amongst fans, although some have labelled Livingstone\u2019s spray as rude and disrespectful. Obviously women aren\u2019t allowed to occasionally be those things. On Twitter, Harris, who is also a professional boxer, chipped in, replying simply \u201csame\u201d to a tweet from the broadcaster looking forward to a potential rematch between the sides in the finals. On Monday afternoon she posted an image of a prowling lion with the phrase \u201ca lion never loses sleep over the opinions of sheep\u201d. Mic drop. Livingstone has, probably wisely, back-pedalled a little since Sunday, calling her comments a \u201cbit of smack talk\u201d and saying she \u201ccould have chosen her words better\u201d. But she should be lauded for her honesty \u2013 something often lacking in yawn-inducing post-match interviews in the men\u2019s game \u2013 and for showing the fervour in the women\u2019s game runs deep. The competition will only benefit from such passion and pure humanity, two characteristics that drive a love of a sport, whoever is playing it. It\u2019s the stuff of column inches and talkback content and bar-stool debate. And if Collingwood and Carlton do meet in the finals, it\u2019ll be treated very differently than if Livingstone had delivered meaningless platitudes for 22 seconds, that\u2019s for sure. For showing women can be brutal, can have swagger, can be boastful and yes maybe even a bit rude at times, Livingstone has also done much for little girls watching at home. She shows girls and women don\u2019t have to fit in a box and don\u2019t have to play nice. Maybe Ulrich did mean women must misbehave to change the world, after all.",

      "bodyText": "A flexible solar \u201cskin\u201d that could be used to generate power on homes, cars and phones is a step closer to development after the technology was used to break a world record for electricity conversion, researchers say. Engineers at the University of Queensland have been working with nanoparticles known as quantum dots that pass electrons and generate an electrical current when exposed to solar energy. The dots can be printed on flexible sheets that have the potential to be used as a transparent skin to power devices including mobile phones and electric vehicles, and applied to windows and other surfaces. Lianzhou Wang, an Australian Research Council laureate fellow in materials engineering, and a team of researchers have broken the world record for the conversion of solar energy into electricity using these quantum dots. The previous record efficiency for converting sunshine into electricity using quantum dot solar cells was 13.4%. The university said Wang and his team had increased that to 16.6%. It has been recognised as a record by the US National Energy Research Laboratory. Wang said the improvement of nearly 25% was a significant step towards the technology becoming commercially viable and supporting global efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions. \u201cIt is effectively the difference between quantum dot solar cell technology being an exciting prospect and being commercially viable,\u201d he said. Wang said advantages of the technology compared to traditional solar cell technology included it being lightweight, flexible and able to work in weaker light, such as on cloudy days or under indoor lighting. He said it could be used for a range of applications, including cars and wearable technology, and was relatively cheap to produce. His team aims to increase the conversion efficiency to 20% and scale up the printing process to produce large solar cells. \u201cOur immediate target is to try to further break the world record in this category,\u201d Wang said. He said they hoped to develop a product that could be brought to market for small appliances, such as a phone, within two years, and within three to five years for large-scale power compatible with rooftop solar. Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court, a senior advisor to the Energy Transition Hub at the University of Melbourne, said the technology would have to be cheaper and have a smaller environmental footprint than existing solar options to be successful. \u201cThere\u2019s always a long list of reputed benefits for this kind of thing, but 99.9% of solar from here on goes either on people\u2019s roofs or in fields in big solar farms,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>More past comments emerged on Monday to further dog media mogul and billionaire Mike Bloomberg\u2019s chase for the Democratic presidential nomination, including an apparent attack on the intelligence of factory and farm workers in the US.</p> <p>Speaking at Oxford University\u2019s Sa\u00efd business school in the UK in 2016, the former mayor of New York appeared to question if blue-collar workers had the skills necessary to adapt to the information technology age. The comments <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bloomberg-implied-farming-is-easy-in-2016-comments\">were reported by Fox News</a>.</p> <p>Also on Monday there was increasing scrutiny of 2013 Bloomberg speeches, made in his final year as mayor and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/16/michael-bloomberg-teachers-civil-libertarians-nra-115430\">reported by Politico</a>, branding local members of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and New York\u2019s teachers union as \u201cextremists\u201d and likening them to the gun lobbying group the National Rifle Association (NRA).</p> <p>The new controversies come as Bloomberg seeks to gain ground in the fractured 2020 race to challenge Donald Trump for the White House in November, which continues with next Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucuses and the following week\u2019s South Carolina primary.</p> <p>Bloomberg has opted to skip voting in the early states and focus instead on a grand entrance to the race on Super Tuesday on 3 March, when Democrats in 14 states go to the polls.</p> <p>The uncovering of the latest videos mirrors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/16/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-michael-bloomberg-nevada-caucuses\">recent revelations of other past comments</a>, including leaked \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d audio clips that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/11/bloomberg-trump-escalate-feud-candidate-improves-polls-race-stop-and-frisk\">sparked a Twitter feud</a> between Bloomberg and Trump a week ago and a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/13/bloomberg-stop-and-frisk-114755\">crisis in his campaign</a> stemming from <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/13/bloomberg-stop-and-frisk-114755\">allegations of racism</a> against the billionaire businessman.</p> <p>Both Trump and Bloomberg\u2019s Democratic rivals have stepped up their attacks, the Democratic frontrunner Bernie Sanders telling supporters <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sanders-bloomberg-attempting-buy-presidency/story?id=69020719\">at a rally in Nevada on Sunday</a> that \u201cthe American people are sick and tired of billionaires buying elections\u201d.</p> <p>In his 2016 Oxford remarks, delivered during a distinguished speakers\u2019 forum, Bloomberg was asked if citizens of middle America could be united with those living on the coasts.</p> <p>\u201cI could teach anybody, even people in this room, no offense intended, to be a farmer,\u201d Bloomberg said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a process. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. You could learn that. Then we had 300 years of the industrial society. You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow and you can have a job.</p> <p>\u201cNow comes the information economy [which is] fundamentally different because it\u2019s built around replacing people with technology and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze, and that is a whole degree level different. You have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter.\u201d</p> <p>He continued that it \u201cwasn\u2019t clear\u201d if \u201cstudents can learn\u201d, even with subsidized housing and education.</p> <p>The reporting of Bloomberg\u2019s comments drew swift rebuke from opponents, including People for Bernie, a pro-Sanders activist group with more than 185,000 Twitter followers. \u201cTime and again we see Bloomberg insulting the middle class and the working class, union members and not yet union members,\u201d it said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/People4Bernie/status/1229188322565558272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fpolitics%2Fbloomberg-implied-farming-is-easy-in-2016-comments\">in a tweet</a>.</p> <p>Bloomberg\u2019s apparent attack on civil rights workers and teachers in 2013 came when, as mayor, he was battling his city\u2019s chapter of the ACLU over the New York police department\u2019s \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policies, which the group claimed was disproportionately affecting young black males.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need extremists on the left or right running our police department, whether it\u2019s the NRA or the NYCLU,\u201d he said in the video obtained by Politico, which explained that the civil liberties group was pursuing legislation at the time that would make it easier for those targeted by the policy to sue the city.</p> <p>Other Bloomberg comments the same year, just months after the Sandy Hook massacre at a Connecticut elementary school claimed 27 lives, outraged the leadership of the New York\u2019s United Federation of Teachers, which had also been critical of stop and frisk.</p> <p>\u201cThe NRA\u2019s another place where the membership, if you do the polling, doesn\u2019t agree with the leadership,\u201d Bloomberg said.</p> <p>Randi Weingarten, the leader of the national teachers union and a former head of the New York chapter, described the comments as \u201cdisgusting\u201d at the time. \u201cBy comparing the NRA and the [union], it cheapens his advocacy about gun control at a time when we need his advocacy to be sharp,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The two have since reconciled and Weingarten <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/483243-union-leader-bloomberg-can-go-all-the-way\">told Full Court Press</a> at the weekend she believes Bloomberg \u201ccan go all the way\u201d.</p> <p>The Bloomberg campaign, meanwhile, sought to downplay the controversy. Spokesman Stu Loeser said the \u201creference to the [teachers union] was something Mike said in the heat of the moment that he now regrets,\u201d Politico reported.</p> <p>Bloomberg is third in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/national/\">national poll of Democratic candidates</a> with 15.4%, trailing only Sanders (22.7%) and former vice-president Joe Biden (16.8%).</p>",

      "bodyText": "More past comments emerged on Monday to further dog media mogul and billionaire Mike Bloomberg\u2019s chase for the Democratic presidential nomination, including an apparent attack on the intelligence of factory and farm workers in the US. Speaking at Oxford University\u2019s Sa\u00efd business school in the UK in 2016, the former mayor of New York appeared to question if blue-collar workers had the skills necessary to adapt to the information technology age. The comments were reported by Fox News. Also on Monday there was increasing scrutiny of 2013 Bloomberg speeches, made in his final year as mayor and reported by Politico, branding local members of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and New York\u2019s teachers union as \u201cextremists\u201d and likening them to the gun lobbying group the National Rifle Association (NRA). The new controversies come as Bloomberg seeks to gain ground in the fractured 2020 race to challenge Donald Trump for the White House in November, which continues with next Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucuses and the following week\u2019s South Carolina primary. Bloomberg has opted to skip voting in the early states and focus instead on a grand entrance to the race on Super Tuesday on 3 March, when Democrats in 14 states go to the polls. The uncovering of the latest videos mirrors recent revelations of other past comments, including leaked \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d audio clips that sparked a Twitter feud between Bloomberg and Trump a week ago and a crisis in his campaign stemming from allegations of racism against the billionaire businessman. Both Trump and Bloomberg\u2019s Democratic rivals have stepped up their attacks, the Democratic frontrunner Bernie Sanders telling supporters at a rally in Nevada on Sunday that \u201cthe American people are sick and tired of billionaires buying elections\u201d. In his 2016 Oxford remarks, delivered during a distinguished speakers\u2019 forum, Bloomberg was asked if citizens of middle America could be united with those living on the coasts. \u201cI could teach anybody, even people in this room, no offense intended, to be a farmer,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s a process. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. You could learn that. Then we had 300 years of the industrial society. You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow and you can have a job. \u201cNow comes the information economy [which is] fundamentally different because it\u2019s built around replacing people with technology and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze, and that is a whole degree level different. You have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter.\u201d He continued that it \u201cwasn\u2019t clear\u201d if \u201cstudents can learn\u201d, even with subsidized housing and education. The reporting of Bloomberg\u2019s comments drew swift rebuke from opponents, including People for Bernie, a pro-Sanders activist group with more than 185,000 Twitter followers. \u201cTime and again we see Bloomberg insulting the middle class and the working class, union members and not yet union members,\u201d it said in a tweet. Bloomberg\u2019s apparent attack on civil rights workers and teachers in 2013 came when, as mayor, he was battling his city\u2019s chapter of the ACLU over the New York police department\u2019s \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policies, which the group claimed was disproportionately affecting young black males. \u201cWe don\u2019t need extremists on the left or right running our police department, whether it\u2019s the NRA or the NYCLU,\u201d he said in the video obtained by Politico, which explained that the civil liberties group was pursuing legislation at the time that would make it easier for those targeted by the policy to sue the city. Other Bloomberg comments the same year, just months after the Sandy Hook massacre at a Connecticut elementary school claimed 27 lives, outraged the leadership of the New York\u2019s United Federation of Teachers, which had also been critical of stop and frisk. \u201cThe NRA\u2019s another place where the membership, if you do the polling, doesn\u2019t agree with the leadership,\u201d Bloomberg said. Randi Weingarten, the leader of the national teachers union and a former head of the New York chapter, described the comments as \u201cdisgusting\u201d at the time. \u201cBy comparing the NRA and the [union], it cheapens his advocacy about gun control at a time when we need his advocacy to be sharp,\u201d she said. The two have since reconciled and Weingarten told Full Court Press at the weekend she believes Bloomberg \u201ccan go all the way\u201d. The Bloomberg campaign, meanwhile, sought to downplay the controversy. Spokesman Stu Loeser said the \u201creference to the [teachers union] was something Mike said in the heat of the moment that he now regrets,\u201d Politico reported. Bloomberg is third in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s national poll of Democratic candidates with 15.4%, trailing only Sanders (22.7%) and former vice-president Joe Biden (16.8%).",

When it reopens there will be more emphasis on unlocking the potential of future generations, the museum added \u201cWe want to empower children to realise that every act of creativity is wondrous,\u201d said Tristram Hunt, the director of the V&amp;A. \u201cWhether it\u2019s self-expression through their clothes, building a world on Minecraft, or launching a school climate strike.\u201d The museum opened as the Bethnal Green Museum of Science and Arts in 1872, becoming the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood in 1974. Many visitors find the Bethnal Green building a dark and cold place so the plan is to create spaces which are more open, exciting and immersive, said the museum. Concept designs by AOC Architecture show rooms inspired by Alice inWonderland and the museum\u2019s main hall reimagined as a town square. Simpson stressed they were \u201cnot chucking the baby out with the bath water\u201d and there would still be popular and nostalgic favourites \u2013 such as the collection of dolls houses \u2013 but displayed differently. \u201cIt is about always looking forward rather than just looking back.\u201d Doors will close on 11 May and reopen in 2022 in what will be the museum\u2019s 150th anniversary year. On the May bank holiday before, a three-day festival, RE-INVENT, will be held to signal the new vision. Simpson said it had been impossible to avoid closure because of the scale of the project and the need for total modernisation. \u201cWe are looking at every single corner of it and bringing a lot more space into public use,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is basically a big Victorian shed so you can\u2019t close off one bit without closing another so we just had to run at it.\u201d There will be three new galleries. \u201cPlay\u201d will include everything from the crowdfunded card game Exploding Kittens to chess. \u201cImagine\u201d will include exploring stories behind characters, whether Paddington Bear, Pikachu or the Loch Ness monster. \u201cDesign\u201d will include an artist-in-residence programme entitled the Designer\u2019s House as well as displays which feature examples of contemporary design such as the micro-scooter. Hunt said the aim was offer a free and outstanding day out for children. \u201cBeloved by the local community, but in need of modernisation, this ambitious transformation will enable the V&amp;A\u2019s museum of childhood to unlock its huge potential to nurture the potential of future generations and become a global champion of children\u2019s creativity.\u201d The Bethnal Green revamp is part of wider activity in to east London by the V&amp;A with a new five-storey museum scheduled to open on the Olympic site in Stratford in 2023. Ten minutes walk away will be the V&amp;A\u2019s new storage and research centre.",

      "bodyText": "The Irish government revoked approvals for the operator of two regular livestock carriers, the Atlantic M and the Express 1, last week, following questions from the Guardian and Irish farm animal welfare organisation Ethical Farming Ireland (EFI). Internal emails appear to show that Ireland\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) was unaware that the performance ratings for the ships\u2019 operator was below the required standard until a campaigner from EFI got in touch last year. Last week DAFM told the Guardian it had written to the \u201cowner/operator of the Atlantic M and the Express 1 regarding the department\u2019s intention to revoke their approval \u2026 once the department became aware of the performance rating\u201d. \u201cThe operator was given 14 days to make representations\u201d, the email went on to say, before the \u201cowners/operator\u2019s approval was subsequently revoked\u201d. Ireland\u2019s exports of dairy, beef and livestock are a pillar of its agri-food sector. The latest figures from Bord Bia, the Irish food board, show agri-food products account for 10% of total exports. International sales of meat and livestock earned the country almost \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.3bn) in 2019. Shipping is an opaque and complex area, however, all the more so when live animals are involved. In 2016, to complement EU law, Ireland introduced another layer of regulation on the carriage of livestock by sea. The regulations stipulate that the performance level of companies operating livestock vessels \u201cmust not be listed as \u2018low or very low\u2019 on the performance tables of Port State Control published by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA)\u201d. But the operator of the Atlantic M and the Express 1, two ships that regularly carry livestock from Ireland, fell into EMSA\u2019s \u201clow or very low\u201d bracket. The EMSA website and Panama-based shipping registration service, PMA Certification, show both vessels are operated by Turkish company Emiroglu Deniz Nakliyati. The list is updated daily and relates to the previous 36 months. The Guardian contacted DAFM to ask for more information about the situation. On 10 February the department replied, saying that it had revoked the operator\u2019s approval for both ships. Questions about the future of both ships, or the approval of a new operator, were not answered. Emails seen by the Guardian indicate that the DAFM was previously unaware that the safety and compliance manager for the Atlantic M and Express 1 was on the EMSA\u2019s \u201clow or very low performance\u201d list. The monitoring gap allowed livestock shipments to continue as normal in the preceding months. In the emails the management for the ships expressed surprise at the sudden approvals revocation in early 2020, given that the vessels had already \u201cloaded from Ireland many [times]\u201d, and each time the DAFM had inspected the vessels, \u201cwe get approval, so what happened now?\u201d In an interview with the Guardian, the ships\u2019 former safety management company, the Istanbul-based Emiro\u011flu Deniz Nakliyat\u0131, confirmed that the DAFM had revoked their approval in January this year because the company was on the EMSA\u2019s low-performing list.

Responding to the lawyer\u2019s comments, the DAFM said the \u201csystem for the approval of vessels for the carriage of livestock in Ireland involves a comprehensive inspection by a marine surveyor and by a departmental veterinarian to determine the suitability of the vessel for that particular purpose\u201d. \u201cIn addition to that, the department requires the vessel to have a valid classification certificate issued by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies.

It\u2019s just crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst anyone in Hereford has ever seen it to be, and the fact that communities are being evacuated, that\u2019s unheard of.\u201d Families in other parts of the country were returning to their flood-hit homes to assess millions of pounds worth of damage caused by Storm Dennis, which brought winds of more than 90mph and up to 150mm (6in) of rain to some areas over the weekend. A month\u2019s worth of rain fell in a 24-hour deluge, causing rivers to swell and burst their banks across towns and villages in south Wales. Hundreds of evacuated families spent Sunday night in emergency shelters. The flooding took thousands of people by surprise, and environment officials at the Welsh government say they will review its warning systems. Sian Williams, the head of operations for north-west Wales at Natural Resources Wales, said: \u201cThis is unprecedented. The worst-hit area was from the Brecon Beacons into the south Wales valleys. \u201cWe have had some of the highest levels we have ever seen in some rivers. The Taff reached its highest level in over 40 years. This is unprecedented in terms of the scale of the rainfall and the levels of the rivers as well.\u201d In Pontypridd, where people were trying to come to terms with the impact of the storm, the owner of a historic pub said the flood water inside had been 5ft deep. Geraint Day, 47, the chairman of the Clwb Y Bont pub, next to the Taff, said: \u201cWe were out helping families on Sunday as those whose homes have been affected are worse off than us. \u201cThe cost of our loss of stock will be about \u00a31,000. But the financial loss will be the cost of reopening. If the damage is bad and it takes months to repair, then we are talking a lot of money.\u201d Gordon Churchill, an RAF veteran who woke on his 96th birthday to find the ground floor of his home underwater, said: \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve managed to save are medals from the war. It\u2019s ruined. Everything. I\u2019ve lost everything.\u201d He was rescued from the property in Nantgarw, south Wales, with his daughter Carolyn, who said: \u201cAt the time I just grabbed every towel and blanket I could find and pushed them up against the front door. We had already got sandbags there because sometimes the front floods a small amount with the drains.\u201d The aftermath of the storm continued to cause transport disruption on Monday as train lines and roads were blocked by flooding and fallen trees. Network Rail was assessing the repairs needed to reopen parts of the railway damaged by torrential downpours and strong winds. CrossCountry, Great Western Railway, Northern, South Western Railway, Southern, Thameslink and Transport for Wales were among the operators to report delays and cancellations. West Mercia police advised motorists not to drive through flooded roads, warning that water levels remained high in many areas across Shropshire. Surrey police said there would be significant delays into the morning rush hour.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The escape, which took place on 7 February, went unreported for days until Ilyina herself told journalists she had broken out, posting a detailed video of her getaway on Instagram.</p> \n<p>Ilyina fell ill after returning from the Chinese resort island of Hainan last month and was put under quarantine by doctors.

      "bodyText": "The British Film Institute has been accused of \u201cerasing\u201d a popular podcast series after the launch of a forthcoming film season that shares part of its title, covers the same themes and has similar artwork. Thirst: Female Desire on Screen was announced last week, with the BFI being accused of stealing the concept of Thirst Aid Kit, which was launched by the former Guardian columnist Bim Adewunmi and the US writer Nichole Perkins in October 2017. Thirst Aid Kit promises to \u201cdig deep into the various ways women express their thirst\u201d, while the BFI season is billed as a series that will \u201cflip the switch on a century of the male gaze and find space for women\u2019s own lust and sexual expression in film\u201d. The BFI, which says it is trying to get in touch with the Thirst Aid Kit team, was accused of erasing the impact of the podcast by its hosts, who said it was \u201cdisappointing to see a lack of acknowledgment\u201d. A spokesperson for the BFI said: \u201cWe are giving this our full attention and taking it very seriously. We have approached Thirst Aid Kit and would like to speak with them before we comment more fully on this matter.\u201d The author and journalist Musa Okwonga called the \u201comission\u201d of Adewunmi and Perkins awful, while others said the BFI was appropriating culture and \u201cstealing concepts\u201d from black women. The hosts of Thirst Aid Kit, which has been praised for its normalising of female desire, said they had been called \u201cdeluded narcissists\u201d for pointing out the similarities between the season and the podcast. \u201cIf people prefer to be obtuse and accuse us of claiming we are the first people in the history of the world to discuss female desire, if that makes them feel better about denying our place in this discourse, have at it,\u201d they tweeted. \u201cWe deserve more than a footnote.\u201d Christina Newland, who programmed the BFI season and has edited a new book of essays about female desire and cinema called She Found It at the Movies, said she began writing about the subject in October 2017 and did not become aware of the podcast until early 2019, after she had started work on the book. \u201cI always admired what they\u2019ve done but it was something that has existed side by side,\u201d Newland told the Guardian. \u201cWe are people who have likeminded interests, but I\u2019m in no way inspired by them. Female desire is such a wide-ranging subject and we were having different conversations about it at the same time.\u201d She said she had approached Perkins twice last year about being involved in the book. Newland said she thought there was \u201csomething going on with the optics\u201d when asked about aesthetic similarities but that as a freelancer she had no say on the final design. She also tweeted that the design of the season was partly inspired by a 1977 issue of Playgirl. Similar accusations of plagiarism were levelled against the BBC last year when the Guardian columnist Yomi Adegoke said the corporation had \u201cripped off\u201d the phrase \u201cslay in your lane\u201d, which featured in an ad campaign and was also the title of a book she co-authored. Adegoke wrote about the experience for the Guardian, saying: \u201cWhite men and women co-opting a phrase trademarked by two black women for a campaign, then fronting it with a black woman to feign some form of affiliation is shocking.\u201d In July 2019, the publisher of a book about racism in the UK was accused of plagiarising Reni Eddo-Lodge\u2019s bestselling polemic Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race after releasing a book with a similar cover design and title. Ben Lindsay, the author of We Need To Talk About Race, and its publisher, SPCK, said the book\u2019s design was inspired by the posters used in the American civil rights movement of the 1960s, adding: \u201cReni\u2019s book, along with numerous other titles, focused on race relations, share this same inspiration.\u201d Writing at the time, Adegoke said the approach taken by SPCK showed the \u201ccopy and paste\u201d attitude publishers had towards minority authors.",

When it bows out on 26 March (3 May in the UK) it will be on its 96th episode. Eight seasons is a rare accomplishment for a scripted drama these days, and it\u2019s amazing it has got this far. The show arrived in 2011 with a barnstorming first season that filled the gap left by 24.</p> <p>The premise was a doozy: missing marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/12/damian-lewis-homeland-kill-brody\">Damian Lewis</a>), who had been presumed dead, is freed from years of imprisonment under terrorist Abu Nazir and returns home a hero. However, CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) sees the truth: Brody is a double agent, turned in captivity and primed for atrocity. As Carrie cried conspiracy, it was dismissed as the product of her bipolar disorder. Her condition was at once her superpower and her fatal flaw; in her manic phase she spotted connections no other agent could, but she also saw things that weren\u2019t there. The job she needed to survive was almost certainly going to kill her. It was the tightrope Danes walked each week, and it won her a Primetime Emmy and critical praise.</p> <p>Of course, it was a given that Carrie and Brody would write a bad romance. As brilliant, beautiful and broken as her, he matched her energy every time they faced off. A heady mix of betrayal and lust between mortal enemies developed. It didn\u2019t hurt that Danes and Lewis had the kind of chemistry that can carry an entire series if it needs to. Once viewers are invested in a relationship, they are on the hook. The heavy lifting storytellers are accustomed to becomes light work.</p> <p>When a divisive finale in season one caused consternation, viewers tuned in to see how these two patched things up. Of course, it eventually ended with Brody hanging from a giant crane in Iran. There would be no last-minute reprieve or glorious resurrection. Three seasons in, Homeland had slaughtered its beloved son. What direction would it take? Could Homeland survive without him?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f91227dab8d963f6289981f1c6b2cc6881f15f50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f91227dab8d963f6289981f1c6b2cc6881f15f50/0_0_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A heady mix of betrayal and lust\u2019 ...

Carrie became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/oct/12/homeland-recap-season-four-episode-one-the-drone-queen\">the Drone Queen</a>, the CIA\u2019s youngest-ever station chief, carrying out her unique brand of car-bomb diplomacy with the relish of the true fanatic. While her relationship with father-figure Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin) increasingly became the heart of the show, what was most impressive was how events on-screen mirrored real life. In the Berlin-set fifth season, it depicted an attempted terrorist attack on a European capital in the same timeframe as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/nov/14/paris-attacks-what-we-know-so-far\">November 2015 attacks in Paris</a>. Then, season six opened with president-elect Elizabeth Keane at war with the intelligence community at the same time Donald Trump and the National Security establishment went to the mat in Washington.</p> <p>The eerie resonance continued with sock puppet-stuffed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/20/homeland-series-six-episode-nine-sock-puppets\">troll farms</a>, foreshadowing Robert Mueller\u2019s indictment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/16/robert-mueller-russians-charged-election\">13 Russians</a> from the notorious Internet Research Agency and when the Kremlin co-opted <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/russia-is-co-opting-angry-young-men/568741/\">\u201calt-right\u201d goons</a> for their own ends, Homeland had fake news master <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/18/homeland-recap-season-7-episode-5-active-measures\">Yevgeny Gromov</a> sowing discord. It was starting to get more than a bit spooky.</p> <p>These plots weren\u2019t just blind luck. The annual conference of showrunners, stars, the intelligence community and state department officials has been crucial to the show\u2019s prescience. The week-long event was a grounding in the state of affairs that Danes referred to as a \u201cmassive, terribly unnerving download about what\u2019s really happening and what is likely to happen\u201d. It allowed Homeland to stay ahead of the game and ensure that, particularly in its later seasons, there was no more relevant show on TV.</p> <p>None of which is to argue for a stay of execution. Eight seasons is an epic innings for a show that could easily have run out of ideas a lot earlier \u2013 24\u2019s more desperate episodes bear witness to that. Homeland deserves to go out on top. Apart from everything else, Carrie looks as if she could do with the break. Its greatest achievement was its reinvention as a commentary on the war on US enemies, foreign and domestic. In the end, then, Homeland became that rarest of oddities: a show improved by its midlife crisis.</p>",

Of course, it was a given that Carrie and Brody would write a bad romance. As brilliant, beautiful and broken as her, he matched her energy every time they faced off. A heady mix of betrayal and lust between mortal enemies developed. It didn\u2019t hurt that Danes and Lewis had the kind of chemistry that can carry an entire series if it needs to. Once viewers are invested in a relationship, they are on the hook. The heavy lifting storytellers are accustomed to becomes light work. When a divisive finale in season one caused consternation, viewers tuned in to see how these two patched things up. Of course, it eventually ended with Brody hanging from a giant crane in Iran. There would be no last-minute reprieve or glorious resurrection. Three seasons in, Homeland had slaughtered its beloved son. What direction would it take? Could Homeland survive without him? As it turned out, Homeland thrived. Carrie became the Drone Queen, the CIA\u2019s youngest-ever station chief, carrying out her unique brand of car-bomb diplomacy with the relish of the true fanatic. While her relationship with father-figure Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin) increasingly became the heart of the show, what was most impressive was how events on-screen mirrored real life. In the Berlin-set fifth season, it depicted an attempted terrorist attack on a European capital in the same timeframe as the November 2015 attacks in Paris. Then, season six opened with president-elect Elizabeth Keane at war with the intelligence community at the same time Donald Trump and the National Security establishment went to the mat in Washington. The eerie resonance continued with sock puppet-stuffed troll farms, foreshadowing Robert Mueller\u2019s indictment of 13 Russians from the notorious Internet Research Agency and when the Kremlin co-opted \u201calt-right\u201d goons for their own ends, Homeland had fake news master Yevgeny Gromov sowing discord. It was starting to get more than a bit spooky. These plots weren\u2019t just blind luck. The annual conference of showrunners, stars, the intelligence community and state department officials has been crucial to the show\u2019s prescience. The week-long event was a grounding in the state of affairs that Danes referred to as a \u201cmassive, terribly unnerving download about what\u2019s really happening and what is likely to happen\u201d. It allowed Homeland to stay ahead of the game and ensure that, particularly in its later seasons, there was no more relevant show on TV. None of which is to argue for a stay of execution. Eight seasons is an epic innings for a show that could easily have run out of ideas a lot earlier \u2013 24\u2019s more desperate episodes bear witness to that. Homeland deserves to go out on top. Apart from everything else, Carrie looks as if she could do with the break. Its greatest achievement was its reinvention as a commentary on the war on US enemies, foreign and domestic. In the end, then, Homeland became that rarest of oddities: a show improved by its midlife crisis.",

I&#39;m still pretty slow-going at the moment, but I won this beauty in a giveaway hosted by the Vintage Women Book Club (@vintagebooks) on Facebook. Seems appropriate given that I come from London, have just gotten married and am about to give birth. It also helps that Evans&#39; writing is utterly spectaclar. I particularly love her descriptions of Crystal Palace Park in the opening pages. My own blood is soaked into the earth up between the decades-old dinosaurs and palace ruins, so it feels a little bit like a homecoming of sorts. __ #openbookshelf #ordinarypeople #vintagebooks #TOBFeatures</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theopenbookshelf/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Abbey | Bookstagrammer</a> (@theopenbookshelf) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-02-16T10:21:06+00:00\">Feb 16, 2020 at 2:21am PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>",
      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/feb/10/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/feb/03/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\"> </a>from the last week.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100520245\">AbsoluteBeginner76</a> who has been enjoying Mackintosh by W Somerset Maugham, \u201ca master of the compressed tale\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These are all stories set in the South Pacific, in American or Western Samoa. The eye for detail is not maybe as intricately composed as Conrad or as lyrical as Melville but Maugham conveys a setting well, mixed with the important cultural mores of the anglo-saxons dotted around these islands, administering curious justice and concern for the \u201cnatives\u201d.</p> <p>Maugham strikes me as an observer with an eye on the wrongs of imperialism, despite being a product of it. There is as much adherence to and observation of Polynesian dress, rituals and morals, the islands are clearly a place he loved, while the Anglo-Saxons are realistically portrayed with all their flaws, arrogance, ennui and frustrations. Magnificent to read.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brett Anderson\u2019s Coal Black Mornings has impressed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2599444\">dylan37</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a beautifully written memoir of childhood, disappointment, a yearning for something better that always seemed to exist in another town - one that you didn\u2019t have a ticket for. Ending just as Suede were going to hit big, this is open and generous, loving and honest. It\u2019s also a testament to belief and vision, and the right circumstances colluding to give you the moment - if you\u2019re alert enough to take it.</p> </blockquote> <p>A Perfectly Good Man by Patrick Gale \u201cis a lovely story\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100090602\">GELBuck</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s nicely plotted with an enjoyable cast of characters and a suitably odious villain. This is certainly not real life - the story is tidier, the characters better lit and the ending more satisfactory than messy reality. But greatly entertaining.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nora Roberts is the author of 220 novels and first inductee into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4515468\">vermontlogger</a>, who has been reading the prolific author\u2019s novel, Montana Sky:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was not terrible! Her method is: strong story that doesn\u2019t have to be plausible (three half-sisters from different worlds inherit father\u2019s ranch), varied cast of other people (one person per character trait), very good plotting, limited nuance and wit, a lot of blunt dialogue (everyone intent on telling it like it is), more sex than you might expect, and three eligible men who, it appears, will pair off with the sisters by the end. Then, wham, blood-soaked viciousness like you wouldn\u2019t believe. Now there is tension, fear, suspicion. We have abruptly exited the universe of Hallmark movies. When next I\u2019m looking for some literary down-time I\u2019ll try another of hers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hold The Dark by William Giraldi has brought back fond memories for <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16060838\">Tom Mooney</a>:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>God, this was grim. So very grim. I enjoyed it. Violent, bloody, macho wilderness noir. A bit of a poor-man\u2019s Alaskan Cormac McCarthy. Y\u2019know, the early McCarthy, where everyone is damaged and evil. This is the kind of thing I used to read all the time so it was a bit like visiting an old friend. Not great but it was good old fashioned twisted fun.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2238842\">FrogC</a> has also been revisiting old memories in Iris Murdoch\u2019s The Black Prince:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first Murdoch I\u2019ve read for several years - I had a phase of reading her a lot then suddenly stopped. And this novel reminds me why. She writes with passion and wit, and creates an intriguing world, but after a while there\u2019s something airless about it, and I feel it\u2019s <em>her</em> world, not one I recognise. Afterwards I feel I\u2019ve been to Murdochland and come back without any souvenirs. Most of her novels, very readable at the time, don\u2019t stay in my mind afterwards, and I have trouble remembering which was which.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, a fortuitous discovery of Ursula K Le Guin\u2019s Wizard Of Earthsea took <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3678005\">reverendbow</a> on a journey into the past:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was working in a bit of a deprived part of London a couple of weeks ago and was surprised to come across a book cafe. I wandered in and most of the books that had been donated seemed to be the standard stuff you find in charity shops, five copies of The Da Vinci Code or Shane Ritchie\u2019s Rags to Richie etc. However I was pleased to find an old copy of The Wizard of Earthsea in amongst the tat. I started reading it and I was hooked, as I was when I read it as a teenager, and was inevitably a bit late for work. Anyway re-discovering that book and remembering an article on the Guardian a few weeks ago about the joys of re-reading inspired me to read the whole Earthsea saga again.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from the last week. Let\u2019s start with AbsoluteBeginner76 who has been enjoying Mackintosh by W Somerset Maugham, \u201ca master of the compressed tale\u201d: These are all stories set in the South Pacific, in American or Western Samoa. The eye for detail is not maybe as intricately composed as Conrad or as lyrical as Melville but Maugham conveys a setting well, mixed with the important cultural mores of the anglo-saxons dotted around these islands, administering curious justice and concern for the \u201cnatives\u201d. Maugham strikes me as an observer with an eye on the wrongs of imperialism, despite being a product of it. There is as much adherence to and observation of Polynesian dress, rituals and morals, the islands are clearly a place he loved, while the Anglo-Saxons are realistically portrayed with all their flaws, arrogance, ennui and frustrations. Magnificent to read. Brett Anderson\u2019s Coal Black Mornings has impressed dylan37: This is a beautifully written memoir of childhood, disappointment, a yearning for something better that always seemed to exist in another town - one that you didn\u2019t have a ticket for. Ending just as Suede were going to hit big, this is open and generous, loving and honest. It\u2019s also a testament to belief and vision, and the right circumstances colluding to give you the moment - if you\u2019re alert enough to take it. A Perfectly Good Man by Patrick Gale \u201cis a lovely story\u201d says GELBuck: It\u2019s nicely plotted with an enjoyable cast of characters and a suitably odious villain. This is certainly not real life - the story is tidier, the characters better lit and the ending more satisfactory than messy reality. But greatly entertaining. Nora Roberts is the author of 220 novels and first inductee into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame says vermontlogger, who has been reading the prolific author\u2019s novel, Montana Sky: It was not terrible! Her method is: strong story that doesn\u2019t have to be plausible (three half-sisters from different worlds inherit father\u2019s ranch), varied cast of other people (one person per character trait), very good plotting, limited nuance and wit, a lot of blunt dialogue (everyone intent on telling it like it is), more sex than you might expect, and three eligible men who, it appears, will pair off with the sisters by the end. Then, wham, blood-soaked viciousness like you wouldn\u2019t believe. Now there is tension, fear, suspicion. We have abruptly exited the universe of Hallmark movies. When next I\u2019m looking for some literary down-time I\u2019ll try another of hers. Hold The Dark by William Giraldi has brought back fond memories for Tom Mooney: God, this was grim. So very grim. I enjoyed it. Violent, bloody, macho wilderness noir. A bit of a poor-man\u2019s Alaskan Cormac McCarthy. Y\u2019know, the early McCarthy, where everyone is damaged and evil. This is the kind of thing I used to read all the time so it was a bit like visiting an old friend. Not great but it was good old fashioned twisted fun. FrogC has also been revisiting old memories in Iris Murdoch\u2019s The Black Prince: The first Murdoch I\u2019ve read for several years - I had a phase of reading her a lot then suddenly stopped. And this novel reminds me why. She writes with passion and wit, and creates an intriguing world, but after a while there\u2019s something airless about it, and I feel it\u2019s her world, not one I recognise. Afterwards I feel I\u2019ve been to Murdochland and come back without any souvenirs. Most of her novels, very readable at the time, don\u2019t stay in my mind afterwards, and I have trouble remembering which was which. Finally, a fortuitous discovery of Ursula K Le Guin\u2019s Wizard Of Earthsea took reverendbow on a journey into the past: I was working in a bit of a deprived part of London a couple of weeks ago and was surprised to come across a book cafe. I wandered in and most of the books that had been donated seemed to be the standard stuff you find in charity shops, five copies of The Da Vinci Code or Shane Ritchie\u2019s Rags to Richie etc. However I was pleased to find an old copy of The Wizard of Earthsea in amongst the tat. I started reading it and I was hooked, as I was when I read it as a teenager, and was inevitably a bit late for work. Anyway re-discovering that book and remembering an article on the Guardian a few weeks ago about the joys of re-reading inspired me to read the whole Earthsea saga again. Just finished the sixth book The Other Wind. It is notable how the second three books are more mature than the first three. But I still enjoyed all of them and was quite emotional at the end of the final book. A combination of enjoying the books now and also remembering how much I\u2019d enjoyed them when I read them for the first time. Sounds like time well spent. Interesting links about books and reading \u201cI met the man who became my husband at a book party\u2026\u201d Emily Eakin on finding love through books. Amazon \u201cscares me\u201d, says Jeff Bezos\u2019s first employee. \u201cWhat is the Role of the Writer in a Time of Rising Nationalism?\u201d asks Arundhati Roy. Another day, another \u201cscandal\u201d about identity. Books are better than films \u2013 and now we have the science to prove it. Kind of. Okay, not really. But still.

In the UK the same proportion of cases and deaths as China (currently) would mean around 3,000 cases and 70 deaths.</p> <p>Despite being far lower than typical annual numbers of flu patients in the UK, there is little doubt that the virus landing in the UK in such numbers would generate widespread panic and have a significant effect on economic activity. In this case, we think the policy response could be more significant \u2013 the Bank of England could take interest rates down close to their zero lower bound in response to the virus becoming more entrenched, though it is not obvious that fiscal policy would be loosened much further than is already planned (especially now Mr Johnson has installed his own man into the Treasury as Chancellor, who may well opt to loosen fiscal policy more than was expected under his predecessor).</p> <p>Still, even more money could be directed towards health spending to help eradicate the virus.

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap: Japan has suffered its worst quarter since 2014. Japanese GDP shrank by 1.6% in the final quarter of this year, the equivalent of a 6.3% annualised slump. Consumer spending fell sharply, hit by a recent sales tax hike, while business investment also dropped. Economics fear that Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest country, could fall into recession this year -- as the coronavirus hits companies exposed to China. Germany\u2019s Bundesbank has warned that its economy doesn\u2019t appear to be picking up, since it stagnated in the final quarter of 2019. It also cited the coronavirus as a threat to growth this year. Japanese bank Nomura has predicted that China\u2019s economy is facing its biggest slowdown since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Airline Cathay Pacific has slashed its profit forecasts, after suffering tumbling demand since the crisis began. Markets have rallied in China, and Europe, after Beijing\u2019s central bank cut the interest rate on its loans to businesses. It could be a prelude to a larger stimulus programme soon. In the UK, consumer confidence has jumped.... as have house prices. European stock markets are clinging onto their earlier gains, with the Stoxx 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX on track for record closing highs. It all feels a little relaxed, given the uncertainty over the coronavirus and the bleak GDP figures from Japan today. Rupert Thompson, Chief Investment Officer at Kingswood, says: That said, the markets do look somewhat complacent. There remains a risk that events turn out significantly worse than markets are now assuming. Epidemiologists seem to be much less sure than the markets that the epidemic is under control. The global economic recovery may also not be quite as secure as markets would have us believe. The spread of the virus may be slowing but estimates of the disruption to Chinese economic activity have been growing. Last week\u2019s return to work and re-opening of factories has not surprisingly been a half-hearted affair given many travel restrictions still in place. Chinese GDP now looks likely to post an outright q/q decline in the first quarter. As for global growth, it will also be hit by the collapse of Chinese tourism and disruption to global supply chains and may grind to a halt in Q1. Shares in Anglo-French biotechnology group Novacyt have surged by over 50% today, after the company launched a molecular test to clinically detect the coronavirus. Novacyt believes this is the first such test to be certified in the EU, following its earlier launch of a \u2018research only\u2019 [RUO] test on 31 January. This new test can be used directly by laboratories and hospitals for the testing of patients, without needing to be validated by clinician, the company says. Novacyt is already deluged with demand -- with requests for quotations for 288,000 CE-Mark tests since they were made available to pre-order on 14 February 2020. The Company has received orders for 40,000 RUO tests and requests for quotations for an additional 35,000 RUO tests prior to the launch of the COVID-19 clinical version. Demand for the tests has come from China, the US and the UK, as well as many other countries around the world, adds the company, which has offices in Camberley, Surrey, United Kingdom and V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, France. Novacyt\u2019s stock has been soaring since its RUO test was launched. It was worth \u20ac0.186 per shares on 20 January, but has now rattled to \u20ac1.86 today. Graham Mullis, CEO of Novacyt says the test can help tackle the coronavirus outbreak: As with our research use only test, it can produce a result in less than two hours, with the added efficiency of being able to transport the test at ambient temperatures eliminating the need for cold chain shipping. It is designed to run on multiple instrument platforms commonly used by clinical laboratories around the world, which ensures our COVID-19 test can be used by the largest possible number of clinicians. We look forward to continuing to support clinicians in the fight to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus during this public health emergency.\u201d What might covonavirus mean for the UK? Nomura\u2019s base-case scenario is that Britain isn\u2019t particularly affected by the outbreak. But in its \u2018severe scenario\u2019 of a long, global, pandemic... growth would be almost wiped out this year, and there would be 70 deaths. Nomura explains: The severe scenario does not only see China\u2019s lockdown last for longer but the disease spreads to match Chinese levels. In the UK the same proportion of cases and deaths as China (currently) would mean around 3,000 cases and 70 deaths. Despite being far lower than typical annual numbers of flu patients in the UK, there is little doubt that the virus landing in the UK in such numbers would generate widespread panic and have a significant effect on economic activity. In this case, we think the policy response could be more significant \u2013 the Bank of England could take interest rates down close to their zero lower bound in response to the virus becoming more entrenched, though it is not obvious that fiscal policy would be loosened much further than is already planned (especially now Mr Johnson has installed his own man into the Treasury as Chancellor, who may well opt to loosen fiscal policy more than was expected under his predecessor). Still, even more money could be directed towards health spending to help eradicate the virus. Our numbers show annual economic growth falling to close to zero in 2020 from our 0.7% base case \u2013 a similar hit to what our US team have assumed. Nomura have also warned that Europe\u2019s economy would be badly hurt if the coronavirus crisis continues to rage in China until the summer, and becomes a full pandemic world wide. The Covid-19 outbreak is already hurting Europe\u2019s economy in three ways: imports from China are disrupted; tourists visits from China are down; and economic sentiment in Europe is hit. If China lifts its lockdown at the end of April, then these effects will be limited. But if the lockdown lasts for longer, and the virus spreads across the globe, then eurozone GDP would shrink this year -- with both Germany and Italy in a full-blown recession. Today\u2019s report warns: If China\u2019s lockdown measures continue for the entirety of H1 2020, but more importantly if the infection becomes pandemic, fear would likely increase dramatically in Europe and activity across all walks of economic life would be affected to some degree. A more prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy would lead to even weaker trade flows, with Germany the most significantly affected among the big four. Supply chains would suffer from severe disruptions, while the spread of the virus to Europe would likely cause a domestic demand shock, with both consumption and investment being hit. In that case we assume euro area GDP would slow to -0.1% y-o-y in 2020 from our base case of 0.7% yo-y. Both Germany and Italy would likely fall into recession in 2020, and we would not exclude the possibility of further monetary policy loosening including lower interest rates and potentially a step-up in the asset purchase programme. Fiscal policy may need to be deployed more proactively too. Analysts at Japanese bank Nomura have published a detailed report on coronavirus -- which is packed with concerning forecasts. Their base case scenario is that China\u2019s growth rate will fall to just 3.0% year-on-year in the current quarter, down from 6% in 2019, with a firm risk of an even bigger slump. That would be the worst performance since the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Nomura say: So much damage has already been done to China\u2019s economy that, even with the lockdown easing in March, it is too late to avoid what is likely to be the largest quarterly drop in real GDP growth since the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989. This base case scenario shows growth recovering during 2020 as factories and offices reopen, and supply chains catch up. But in Nomura\u2019s worst-case scenario, the economy actually flatlines this quarter with just 0.5% growth. Full-year growth falls to 3.9% in 2020 (down from 5.7% originally forecast). Nomura points out that the lockdown measures imposed since the crisis began have hurt businesses, hampered production levels, and damaged consumer spending: China\u2019s economy is experiencing \u201cthe rare case of simultaneous demand and supply shocks\u201d, they warn: Because COVID-19 in China is far worse than SARs in terms of breadth and speed of infections, the \u2018fear factor\u2019 among China\u2019s population is palpable, with people shunning crowded places like shopping malls and restaurants, crimping consumption, which contributed nearly three-fifth of China\u2019s GDP growth last year China\u2019s central government has been pushing local provinces to get back to business, but there is resistance on ground. Nomura\u2019s Ting Lu says \u201cthis appears to be a classic case of prisoners\u2019 dilemma\u201d, with local politicians unwilling to risk being blame for more infections. If a local government official heeds the call of Beijing and eases its local lockdown measures, unblocks roads connecting to other regions, and shifts its focus to reopening factories and shops, the gain would be quite limited if other governments continue to limit commerce and the national logistics network remains in shambles. Also, this local government would be risking a rapid rise of infections in its territory. If that happens, the local government officials could take all the blame, and may even lose their jobs and be subject to further penalties. We believe this special \u201cprisoners\u2019 dilemma\u201d mechanism is also playing a key role why business activities have been so slow to resume. Back in the UK, household confidence has jumped at its fastest rate in over a decade -- perhaps a sign that the Boris Bounce is real.... Just in: Germany\u2019s central bank has warned that its economy is still struggling, and could suffer from the coronavirus crisis in the months ahead. In its monthly update, the Bundesbank says it can\u2019t see any economic change in Germany this quarter -- which is disappointing, as the economy stagnated in the last quarter of 2019. The Bundesbank says: For the first quarter of 2020, there are still no signs of a fundamental economic change in Germany. With regard to industry, the downward trend in incoming orders continued until the end of 2019, albeit with a further decrease in intensity,. However, the mood in this sector of the economy has visibly improved recently. This could indicate that the downward pressure on industrial production is gradually easing.... However, economic risks exist with regard to the coronavirus outbreak in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Here\u2019s our news story on Cathay Pacific\u2019s profits warning: Here\u2019s some more of today\u2019s business stories - from rising house prices in the UK to a row over General Motors: Cathay Pacific Group Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam says his company has endured its toughest Chinese New Year ever. Lam explains that the company\u2019s performance declined dramatically in the last week of January, as the novel coronavirus situation became more severe. This forced the company to cut capacity, and warn today that results for 2020 will be worse than hoped. Lam says: \u201cThis was the most challenging Chinese New Year period we have experienced. As the novel coronavirus outbreak in mainland China intensified towards the end of the holiday period, travel demand dropped substantially. With more governments worldwide having imposed travel restrictions on passengers from mainland China and in some cases Hong Kong, we are seeing continued cancellations of bookings. We have since taken a series of short-term measures in response. These notably include the sharp reduction of capacity across our global network. For February and March, we have now reduced our overall passenger flight capacity by approximately 40%, representing further reduction since our recent announcement. Passenger capacity reduction is also likely for April as we continue to monitor and match market demand. Meanwhile, we have kept our freighter capacity intact. The full statement is online here. Here\u2019s Danny Lee of the South China Morning Post on Cathay Pacific\u2019s warning: Cathay has also reported a 3.8% drop in total passenger traffic last month, compared to January 2019. Incoming passenger numbers to Hong Kong fell 40% -- a staggering slump, which is actually better than the 46% slide seen in November and December. Speaking of airlines....flights from Heathrow today are still being affected by computer problems: Ouch! Airline group Cathay Pacific has just warned that the coronavirus outbreak will have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on its financial results. Hong Kong\u2019s flag carrier says it has slashed capacity by 40% in February and March having suffered a drop in passenger numbers since the crisis began. Cathay was already being hit by the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, so the coronavirus is another blow -- leading to fresh cancellations and refund requests from customers. Cathay Pacific warns: \u201cThe first half of 2020 was already expected to be extremely challenging financially,\u201d \u201cAs a result of this additional significant drop in demand for flights and consequential capacity reduction caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak, the financial results for the first half of 2020 will be significantly down on the same period last year.\u201d The coronavirus crisis has hurt the diamond market, according to London-listed Petra Diamonds this morning. Petra told the City that sentiment in the precious jewels market has \u201csignificantly weakened \u201cdue to the outbreak of the coronavirus in China. Operational cash flow benefits are being eroded by a weaker diamond market, due to the outbreak of the coronavirus, which has served to significantly reduce activity across the pipeline. Diamond sales have been hurt by the retail stores over the important Chinese New Year period. The subsequent postponement of the Hong Kong International Diamond, Gem and Pearl show from early March to mid-May has also damaged confidence. Petra warns that the market could be weak until Covid-19 is under control: The virus is expected to further impact diamond trading and consumer spending in this region (ca. 14% of diamond sales) and further afield, with the end result that activity is expected to reduce across the diamond pipeline until the virus is brought under control. Petra also reported a 6% drop in revenues in the last six months, due to a drop in rough diamond prices. Overnight, ratings agency Moody\u2019s has warned that the coronavirus has dented optimism just as global economy showed signs of stabilization. In a new report, Moody\u2019s explains that it has cut its growth forecasts due to the impact of the coronavirus. It now expects the G20 to grow by 2.4% in 2020, down from 2.6% previously. It also warns that the global economy faces \u201csevere\u201d downside risks if the coronavirus grows to pandemic proportions. Moody\u2019s vice president Madhavi Bokil explains: \u201cThe outbreak will first and foremost hurt China\u2019s economy by lowering discretionary consumer spending on transportation, retail, tourism and entertainment. There is already evidence - albeit anecdotal - that supply chains are being disrupted, including outside China. Furthermore, extended lockdowns in China would have a global impact given the country\u2019s importance and interconnectedness in the global economy,. \u201cWith the virus continuing to spread within China and to other parts of the world, it is still too early to make a final assessment of the impact on China and the global economy.\u201d European stock markets have shrugged off Japan\u2019s dire GDP report. The main bourses are all up this morning, with Germany hitting a new record high. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 16 points, or 0.2%, to 7425 points - recovering some of Thursday and Friday\u2019s losses. Traders are cheered by the news that Beijing\u2019s central bank has lowered the interest rate it charges commercial banks for loans. That is means to encourage lending, and could be a sign that the People\u2019s Bank of China will cut its benchmark rates soon. Economists at ING also believe Japan will sink into a recession this quarter, dragged down by weak spending. They told clients that: \u201cConsumer spending, which slumped following the tax hike in the fourth quarter of 2019, will now struggle to do anything except contract further in the first quarter as the impact of Covid-19 weighs on consumer sentiment, weighing in particular on the consumer services sector.\u201d \u201cSome further government spending may help to curb any further contraction in GDP beyond 1Q20. But that will not stop what started off as a technical downturn from evolving into a full-blown recession. Japan\u2019s habit of reporting GDP in annualised terms is causing some confusion this morning..... We\u2019re still waiting for Canada to cough up its GDP report for the final three months of 2019. But most other major countries have satisfied our thirst for data, and we can see that Japan was the worst-performing major economy last year. America was the strongest member of the G7, followed (some way behind) by the UK. Germany, France and Italy all had a poor year -- dragging the wider eurozone down too. Economist Rupert Seggins has rounded up the details: Japan\u2019s stock market fell following its weak GDP report. The Nikkei lost 164 points or 0.7%, as it ended today\u2019s session at 23,523 points. Other Asia-Pacific markets did better, though. China\u2019s CSI 300 index jumped by over 2% on talk of a Beijing stimulus package to protect its economy from the coronavirus damage. The Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, has hinted that he could ease monetary policy if the coronavirus outbreak hurts the Japanese economy. Kuroda told the Sankei newspaper that Covid-19 virus was the \u201cbiggest uncertainty\u201d facing Japan\u2019s domestic economy, adding: \u201cWe would need to consider monetary policy steps if (the virus outbreak) significantly affects Japan\u2019s economy.\u201d Japan\u2019s economy was also hurt by super-typhoon Hagibis, which struck the country last October. The biggest storm to strike Japan in decades killed at least 90 people, causing widespread flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, says this was one reason Japan\u2019s economy shrank so sharply last quarter, along with the sales tax hike. Minami told AFP: \u201cThere was a hit from natural disasters but consumer sentiment was particularly weak after the tax hike despite government measures to ease the impact.\u201d Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute, is also bracing for recession, telling Reuters: \u201cThere\u2019s a pretty good chance the economy will suffer another contraction in January-March. The virus will mainly hit inbound tourism and exports, but could also weigh on domestic consumption quite a lot. If this epidemic is not contained by the time of the Tokyo Olympic Games, the damage to the economy will be huge.\u201d Here\u2019s more reaction -- none of it particularly positive: Josh Mahoney of IG is worried that the coronavirus will drive Japan\u2019s economy lower. John Ferro of Bloomberg is worried that two of the Big Four economies are at risk of recession. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit fears Japan will struggle until the summer (when the Tokyo Olympics could lift growth). Japan\u2019s economy is now on the brink of recession after shrinking last quarter, and many economists fear it could soon topple in. The coronavirus outbreak is a clear threat to Japan\u2019s economy, given many Japanese manufacturers rely on Chinese companies in their supply chains. Scores of major firms have already closed their factories across China, which will quickly hurt production output. A second consecutive contraction this quarter would means recession: Daiwa Securities economist Mari Iwashita explains: \u201cBecause of the effects of the novel coronavirus, weakness in consumption will likely continue in the January-March period. Exports and production could be dreadfully weak as the supply chain is interrupted.\u201d Robert Ward, Japan chair at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, fears Japan\u2019s economy may struggle to grow this year. Danske Bank analysts also fear recession after today\u2019s \u201cgloomy\u201d Japanese GDP figures, telling clients that: The economy shrank at an annualized pace of 6.3% q/q in Q4, the deepest contraction in five years. The impact of the VAT hike and typhoon Hagibis weighed on economic activity and recession fears are mounting amid the coronavirus outbreak in neighbouring China. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Worries over the global economy have intensified today, after Japan\u2019s economy suffered its sharpest contraction in five years. Japanese GDP shank by 1.6% during the last three months of 2019, new government data overnight shows. That equates to an annualised contraction of 6.3%, against forecasts of 3.9%. That\u2019s a very sharp decline, and much worse than economists had expected. It means Japan has suffered its worst quarter since 2014 -- and its second largest slump since the financial crisis more than a decade ago. Consumer spending fell by 2.9% during the quarter, for the first time in over a year, led by weaker demand for cars, household appliances and alcohol. Tokyo\u2019s government must shoulder some blame -- they were warned that hiking Japan\u2019s sales tax to 10%, from 8%, last autumn would hurt consumption. Business investment also dropped, driven by weaker spending on construction and production machinery. And in another worrying sign, imports and exports both declined. It underlines that Q4 2019 was bad time for the global economy, with growth slowing in China, the UK and Germany stagnating, and France and Italy contracting. Adam Cole of RBC Capital Markets says fears over Japan\u2019s economy are on the rise. Consumer spending fell almost 3% q/q, more than reversing the Q3 rise (0.5%) as households reacted to the October consumption tax increase. Private capital spending also slumped and the data will prompt talk of recession if the monthly data look like they are adding up to another fall in Q1. Otherwise, it could be a quieter day in the markets....especially as Wall Street is shut for President\u2019s Day. The agenda 10am GMT: Eurozone construction output for December",

      "body": "<p>Nominating Michael Bloomberg would be a disaster for public schools \u2013 and for the Democrats\u2019 chances at beating Donald Trump in 2020. Because when it comes to education policy, it is virtually impossible to tell the two billionaire politicians apart.</p> <p>Like Trump and his inept secretary of education, Betsy Devos, Bloomberg is a fervent backer of privatizing and dismantling public schools across the country. Education, in their view, should be run like a business.</p> <p>While other establishment Democrats have begun changing their tune in response to the \u201c<a href=\"http://neatoday.org/redfored/\">Red for Ed</a>\u201d movement, Bloomberg\u2019s campaign spokesman <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-education/2020/01/13/bloombergs-pro-charter-schools-stance-adds-twist-to-2020-debate-784309\">has made it clear</a> that privatization will be a core message of his 2020 presidential run: \u201cMike has always supported charter schools, he opened a record number of charter schools as mayor of New York City, and he will champion the issue as president.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Education, in their view, should be run like a business</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Indeed, Bloomberg succeeded in massively expanding privately run but publicly funded charter schools during his term as mayor, increasing their number from 18 to 183. His controversial push to \u201cincrease school choice\u201d closed over 100 schools in low-income communities and entrenched New York City\u2019s education system as the most racially segregated in the country.</p> <p>In contrast with Bloomberg\u2019s too-little-too-late apology for imposing racist stop-and-frisk policies upon New York City \u2013 and its overwhelmingly non-white student body \u2013 the former mayor has doubled down on his rightwing education approach in recent years.</p> <p>If anything, the main difference between Bloomberg and Trump is that the former has spent far more of his immense personal fortune to boost corporate \u201ceducation reform\u201d and local candidates driving this agenda. The New York Times reported last week that Bloomberg has spent millions to promote charters in the state of Louisiana alone. And this is just the tip of the iceberg: Bloomberg\u2019s foundation in 2018 announced its plan to spend $375m to promote charters, merit pay and the sacking of \u201cfailing\u201d teachers, among other reforms.</p> <p>Bloomberg is also an active promoter of high-stakes testing. Despite abundant evidence that an excessive testing regime does little to improve real educational achievement, Bloomberg has vociferously sung the praises of this system in op-eds such as Demand Better Schools, Not Fewer Tests. Accordingly, as mayor he fought for a merit pay system through which teachers\u2019 salaries would be pegged to student test scores.</p> <p>Like Trump and DeVos, Bloomberg has also viciously attacked teacher unions and scapegoated educators. He spent much of his mayoral tenure fighting with the powerful United Federation of Teachers (UFT), which he compared to the National Rifle Association. As he put it, \u201cif the UFT wants it, it ain\u2019t good\u201d.</p> <p>According to corporate education reformers, our country\u2019s education crisis is produced not by systematic underfunding and social inequality, but rather by the inherent inefficiencies of the public sector, intransigent unions and bad teachers. Bloomberg has often been shockingly direct in expressing his contempt for teachers.

      "bodyText": "Nominating Michael Bloomberg would be a disaster for public schools \u2013 and for the Democrats\u2019 chances at beating Donald Trump in 2020. Because when it comes to education policy, it is virtually impossible to tell the two billionaire politicians apart. Like Trump and his inept secretary of education, Betsy Devos, Bloomberg is a fervent backer of privatizing and dismantling public schools across the country. Education, in their view, should be run like a business. While other establishment Democrats have begun changing their tune in response to the \u201cRed for Ed\u201d movement, Bloomberg\u2019s campaign spokesman has made it clear that privatization will be a core message of his 2020 presidential run: \u201cMike has always supported charter schools, he opened a record number of charter schools as mayor of New York City, and he will champion the issue as president.\u201d Indeed, Bloomberg succeeded in massively expanding privately run but publicly funded charter schools during his term as mayor, increasing their number from 18 to 183. His controversial push to \u201cincrease school choice\u201d closed over 100 schools in low-income communities and entrenched New York City\u2019s education system as the most racially segregated in the country. In contrast with Bloomberg\u2019s too-little-too-late apology for imposing racist stop-and-frisk policies upon New York City \u2013 and its overwhelmingly non-white student body \u2013 the former mayor has doubled down on his rightwing education approach in recent years. If anything, the main difference between Bloomberg and Trump is that the former has spent far more of his immense personal fortune to boost corporate \u201ceducation reform\u201d and local candidates driving this agenda. The New York Times reported last week that Bloomberg has spent millions to promote charters in the state of Louisiana alone. And this is just the tip of the iceberg: Bloomberg\u2019s foundation in 2018 announced its plan to spend $375m to promote charters, merit pay and the sacking of \u201cfailing\u201d teachers, among other reforms. Bloomberg is also an active promoter of high-stakes testing. Despite abundant evidence that an excessive testing regime does little to improve real educational achievement, Bloomberg has vociferously sung the praises of this system in op-eds such as Demand Better Schools, Not Fewer Tests. Accordingly, as mayor he fought for a merit pay system through which teachers\u2019 salaries would be pegged to student test scores. Like Trump and DeVos, Bloomberg has also viciously attacked teacher unions and scapegoated educators. He spent much of his mayoral tenure fighting with the powerful United Federation of Teachers (UFT), which he compared to the National Rifle Association. As he put it, \u201cif the UFT wants it, it ain\u2019t good\u201d. According to corporate education reformers, our country\u2019s education crisis is produced not by systematic underfunding and social inequality, but rather by the inherent inefficiencies of the public sector, intransigent unions and bad teachers. Bloomberg has often been shockingly direct in expressing his contempt for teachers. In 2011, during a speech at MIT, he suggested that if he could have it his way, he\u2019d \u201cweed out all the bad\u201d New York City educators by cutting \u201cthe number of teachers in half\u201d. He insisted that coupling these cuts with doubling class sizes would be \u201ca good deal for the students\u201d. In light of such ill-informed comments, it should come as no surprise that Bloomberg appointed Cathie Black as one of his NYC school chancellors \u2013 despite the fact that the former publishing executive had zero prior experience in education. Unlike Trump\u2019s similarly unqualified Betsy DeVos, Black was capable of holding on to her job for only 95 days. What unites all corporate reform zealots \u2013 irrespective of their party affiliation \u2013 is a fundamental disregard not only for educators and students, but for democracy itself. In New York City, this led Bloomberg to consolidate mayoral control and strip the city\u2019s democratically elected school boards of almost all their power. But the problem goes deeper. Accountable to no-one, Bloomberg, like DeVos, has for decades used his wealth to push pet education \u201creforms\u201d under the guise of philanthropy. In true oligarchic fashion, both have leveraged their fortunes to rise to the heights of political power. And following in Trump\u2019s footsteps, Bloomberg now wants to buy the 2020 Democratic race. For educators, parents, students and teachers\u2019 unions, the stakes could hardly be higher. Nominating Bloomberg would ensure us another four years of corporate education policy. He may begin to tone down his rhetoric on the campaign trail, but there is no reason to believe that a Bloomberg White House would be anything other than Trump Part Two when it comes to education. Though his Republican roots are less evident on some other issues, Bloomberg\u2019s personal and political similarity to Trump will make it very hard for him to win in a general election. Trump\u2019s base remains solid \u2013 we need a candidate who can increase turnout by energizing the Democratic base and involving new voters in the political process. That\u2019s why having Bloomberg as the Democratic party\u2019s standard bearer would make defeating Trump exceedingly difficult.

In recent weeks the prime minister has treated us to teasers of two future projects: a green light for HS2, and the announcement that serious studies are beginning into a bridge over the Irish Sea between Scotland and Northern Ireland. HS2 was inherited from the last Labour government and has been on the agenda for a decade. Despite its controversial nature and spiralling costs, the rail network is a credible project.

To answer that, we need to look at Johnson, who left in his wake a trail of costly failures and unbuilt infrastructure during his eight-year tenure as mayor of London.

More damaging than that was the garden bridge, a fundamentally unnecessary river crossing and corporate event space proposed for the Thames.

It is super to have him.\"<br></p>\n    <p>\"It's a continual building process leading into the World Cup. What we are achieving we are getting better every game we play the guys are pulling together and getting better at what we do so it puts us in a confident space.\"<br></p>\n    <p>Silverwood also suggested the plan to use Jos Buttler as a T20 opener would continue through to the autumn, eased by Buttler\u2019s own return to run-scoring form at SuperSport Park. <b>Barney Ronay</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That team have now gone or been mothballed.

Saqib Mahmood bowled the most significant spell of the ODI series for England, five overs in Johannesburg that suggest he has the fire, skill and athleticism to develop as an international bowler.

England\u2019s white-ball tour of South Africa had been billed as preparation, refinement, revision for the T20 World Cup in Australia. In the event it split neatly into two halves. The second of these was an adrenal three-stage drag race along the coast and back to the Highveld, and a series that suggested while England may or may not be the best Twenty20 team in the world they are surely the most entertaining, flaws and all. South Africa provided a wonderful staging. There were boisterous full houses. Cricket of various types filled out the TV channels and daily newspapers. Even in the glow of his match-winning knock on Sunday, Eoin Morgan took a moment to step outside the bubble and praise the warmth and youth of the host nation. The crowd at Buffalo Park, gleefully mixed as night fell over the grassy banks, was perhaps the enduring image of the tour. Around the same time rumours began to circulate, later confirmed, that Faf du Plessis has stepped down as South Africa\u2019s Test and T20 captain. Du Plessis has been a fine servant, captain of his country in 112 games. But sport moves on and South African cricket will hope to evolve from here in all manner of ways. Before that the 50-over matches had coalesced into one slightly soggy entity. This was an one-day international series fulfilled as an obligation to the listings. Given the demands of all-format cricket, there was never going to be any sense of a victory lap. That team have now gone or been mothballed.

      "body": "<p>Andrew Weatherall, the British musician, DJ and record producer known for helming Primal Scream\u2019s Screamadelica, has died aged 56.</p> <p>His management wrote in a statement: \u201cWe are deeply sorry to announce that Andrew Weatherall, the noted DJ and musician passed away in the early hours of this morning, Monday 17 February 2020, at Whipps Cross Hospital, London. The cause of death was a pulmonary embolism. He was being treated in hospital but unfortunately the blood clot reached his heart. His death was swift and peaceful.\u201d</p> <p>The Weatherall family thanked fans for the outpouring of support: \u201cLizzie, Bob and Ian would like to thank everybody quite literally everywhere for their lovely messages and tributes to Andrew. We know what a special person he was and are overwhelmed at the number of people who knew this too and to hear their stories and how he influenced them is a real joy at such a raw and dreadful time. Please do what he would have wanted: creating, listening, dancing, but above all pushing boundaries.\u201d</p> <p>The author Irvine Welsh was among those paying tribute, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IrvineWelsh/status/1229413488075984896\">writing</a>: \u201cGenius is an overworked term but I\u2019m struggling to think of anything else that defines him.\u201d</p> <p>Following a young adulthood in the post-punk scene, Weatherall became a key figure in countercultural \u2013 and occasionally mainstream \u2013 British music after becoming one of the key DJs in the acid house movement of the late 1980s. He was recruited by Danny Rampling to play at London nightclub Shoom, and soon founded the record label Boy\u2019s Own Recordings and the production outfit Bocca Juniors.</p> <p>Further musical projects included the group the Sabres of Paradise, which splintered into the duo Two Lone Swordsmen with Keith Tenniswood, though perhaps his most famous musical work was with Primal Scream on their breakthrough 1991 album Screamadelica. By taking the band\u2019s anthemic songwriting and adding samples, loops and the euphoric energy of Ibiza, Weatherall\u2019s production made the album one of the most celebrated of the 1990s.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3ixEzKA4k0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y3ixEzKA4k0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Speaking to the NME in 2011, he said of Screamadelica: \u201cLooking back, my arrogance makes me wince, but I would never have had the confidence to do it if I didn\u2019t have that kind of attitude. In a few months I\u2019d gone from basically bumming around to all of a sudden being part of a proper scene. I was at the centre of the cyclone and loving it.\u201d</p> <p>He remixed artists including Bj\u00f6rk, My Bloody Valentine and Saint Etienne; with Terry Farley, he remixed New Order\u2019s 1990 World Cup song World in Motion. He was an early champion of the Chemical Brothers and their debut track Song to the Siren, playing it in his DJ sets and remixing it. He later signed them to Junior Boy\u2019s Own, where they released their debut album. Writing on Twitter, the duo\u2019s Ed Simons said Weatherall was \u201ca true inspiration and hero. A lovely funny man. Incredible DJ\u201d.</p> <p>Weatherall consolidated the trip-hop sound of the mid-1990s with his production on Beth Orton\u2019s 1996 breakthrough album Trailer Park. Orton described him in an Instagram tribute as \u201ca beautiful soul and a genius,\u201d calling his death \u201ca profound loss\u201d.</p> <p>He continued to work as a DJ and producer until his death, with his A Love from Outer Space club night series and production projects like the Asphodells.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Weatherall, the British musician, DJ and record producer known for helming Primal Scream\u2019s Screamadelica, has died aged 56. His management wrote in a statement: \u201cWe are deeply sorry to announce that Andrew Weatherall, the noted DJ and musician passed away in the early hours of this morning, Monday 17 February 2020, at Whipps Cross Hospital, London. The cause of death was a pulmonary embolism. He was being treated in hospital but unfortunately the blood clot reached his heart. His death was swift and peaceful.\u201d The Weatherall family thanked fans for the outpouring of support: \u201cLizzie, Bob and Ian would like to thank everybody quite literally everywhere for their lovely messages and tributes to Andrew. We know what a special person he was and are overwhelmed at the number of people who knew this too and to hear their stories and how he influenced them is a real joy at such a raw and dreadful time. Please do what he would have wanted: creating, listening, dancing, but above all pushing boundaries.\u201d The author Irvine Welsh was among those paying tribute, writing: \u201cGenius is an overworked term but I\u2019m struggling to think of anything else that defines him.\u201d Following a young adulthood in the post-punk scene, Weatherall became a key figure in countercultural \u2013 and occasionally mainstream \u2013 British music after becoming one of the key DJs in the acid house movement of the late 1980s. He was recruited by Danny Rampling to play at London nightclub Shoom, and soon founded the record label Boy\u2019s Own Recordings and the production outfit Bocca Juniors. Further musical projects included the group the Sabres of Paradise, which splintered into the duo Two Lone Swordsmen with Keith Tenniswood, though perhaps his most famous musical work was with Primal Scream on their breakthrough 1991 album Screamadelica. By taking the band\u2019s anthemic songwriting and adding samples, loops and the euphoric energy of Ibiza, Weatherall\u2019s production made the album one of the most celebrated of the 1990s. Speaking to the NME in 2011, he said of Screamadelica: \u201cLooking back, my arrogance makes me wince, but I would never have had the confidence to do it if I didn\u2019t have that kind of attitude. In a few months I\u2019d gone from basically bumming around to all of a sudden being part of a proper scene. I was at the centre of the cyclone and loving it.\u201d He remixed artists including Bj\u00f6rk, My Bloody Valentine and Saint Etienne; with Terry Farley, he remixed New Order\u2019s 1990 World Cup song World in Motion. He was an early champion of the Chemical Brothers and their debut track Song to the Siren, playing it in his DJ sets and remixing it. He later signed them to Junior Boy\u2019s Own, where they released their debut album. Writing on Twitter, the duo\u2019s Ed Simons said Weatherall was \u201ca true inspiration and hero. A lovely funny man. Incredible DJ\u201d. Weatherall consolidated the trip-hop sound of the mid-1990s with his production on Beth Orton\u2019s 1996 breakthrough album Trailer Park. Orton described him in an Instagram tribute as \u201ca beautiful soul and a genius,\u201d calling his death \u201ca profound loss\u201d. He continued to work as a DJ and producer until his death, with his A Love from Outer Space club night series and production projects like the Asphodells. He reunited with Primal Scream in 2002 to co-produce their album Evil Heat. He spoke of the eternal appeal of DJing in a 2016 Guardian interview: \u201cIt\u2019s quite vampyric, DJing. You\u2019re never going to have that feeling of hearing that record for the first time again, but if you look into the eyes of someone who\u2019s hearing it for the first time, it\u2019s a nice vicarious feeling. But it\u2019s not selfish. I think I\u2019ve never lost that thing I had when I was 12 years old and inviting my mates round to my house. They\u2019d all be copping off with girls and I\u2019m going, \u2018No, check out this B-side.\u2019\u201d Musicians paying tribute included the Charlatans\u2019 Tim Burgess, who wrote on Twitter: \u201cShocked and saddened to hear that cosmic traveller Andrew Weatherall has left the building. Always a pleasure to meet up with him and share good times.\u201d Dave Haslam, another key figure in the acid house era, said that Weatherall was \u201cone of the greatest, sweetest, funniest guys I\u2019ve ever met\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018I used to torture frogs when I was young,\u201d the man was telling me, with a stare that would make the most experienced serial killer uneasy. I wasn\u2019t at a Halloween party. It was Friday night in London and I was attending my first singles event. When my friend suggested it, I had expected the evening to be awkward. I hadn\u2019t expected to be nursing a glass of a wine while a stranger described the many brutal ways he had culled the north London amphibian population. After two hours of painful conversation with other guests, we eventually escaped, although not before our new friend leaned in for a bum grope.</p> <p>I was unlucky at this mixer. But even when attendees don\u2019t turn out to be on an RSPCA watch list, singles events can feel more forced than a 90s school disco. I am not alone in my phobia of organised mixers; a recent survey by the Inner Circle revealed that 41% of daters in the UK would refuse to attend one, citing embarrassment and awkwardness as the main reasons.</p> <p>Yet despite people\u2019s preconceptions, the dating app company hasn\u2019t been deterred. It holds 55 events a year, including parties, skiing trips and bingo. The average number of party attendees doubled to more than 300 between 2018 and 2019, suggesting the events are more popular than ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94e1cad45045d127b5b88dd1c10a5b31cc142f9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94e1cad45045d127b5b88dd1c10a5b31cc142f9c/0_67_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bingo for singles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bingo for singles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout undefined</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, more traditional event organisers are also seeing a rise in demand, with SpeedDater running 70 events a month across 23 cities in the UK. \u201cWe are trying to break down the stigma,\u201d says Sarah Payne, the events manager at SpeedDater Events. \u201cThere used to be a big stigma about online dating but that has gone now. It is completely normal to meet online and we\u2019d like to see the same thing happen with events. We do speed dating, but we also run parties, cooking classes and wine tasting.\u201d</p> <p>As people develop \u201capp-based dating fatigue\u201d, singles events are making a comeback. \u201cApps are very appearance-based and events give people the chance to get a better idea of who a person is. People might be unsure about attending them, but then find they enjoy the face-to-face interaction.\u201d</p> <p>Lynn, a 58-year-old life coach from Liverpool, turned to speed dating after becoming disillusioned with Tinder. \u201cA few years ago, people were enthusiastic on apps and wanted to meet up, but that doesn\u2019t seem to happen now,\u201d she explains. \u201cI tried speed dating, because it\u2019s a faster version of apps and you get to meet lots of different people.\u201d Although she hasn\u2019t found any serious romantic prospects, she has had fun and made new friends. \u201cYou can\u2019t take it too seriously or expect too much. You might have to meet a huge number of people to find someone you are actually compatible with.\u201d</p> <p>Some dating companies are putting a spin on singles mixers with events such as naked speed dating or pheromone dating, where people can try to sniff their way to true love. For Alice, 28, a copywriter from Reading, these gimmicks can be fun, but they aren\u2019t likely to lead to love. \u201cI went naked speed dating because I thought it would be something different,\u201d she explains. \u201cUsually, women\u2019s tickets for dating events sell out faster than the men\u2019s tickets, but the opposite was true for this.\u201d</p> <p>She chose to wear her underwear, although many people were naked. While she admits there was a novelty factor, it is not something she will repeat in a hurry. \u201cThere was a weird guy there and a woman told me he was touching himself during the event, which was uncomfortable. I think it might be a good way to meet people if you are into exhibitionism, but I\u2019m not sure it was for me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9ce3f6d59b88a6b7080534cdaed6ccfc3801466\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9ce3f6d59b88a6b7080534cdaed6ccfc3801466/0_135_4968_2982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Events give people the chance to get a better idea of a who a person is\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Singles parties \u2018give people the chance to get a better idea of a who a person is\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blend Images/Jill Giardino/Getty Images/Tetra images RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alice is unconvinced that any type of speed dating leads to love. Instead, she prefers to attend general meet-up groups, where there is no pressure to look for a partner. \u201cI think it\u2019s better when things develop organically. Although some dating events have been OK, I tend to find the women are much more up for it and the men aren\u2019t really people I\u2019d go for.\u201d</p> <p>The desire for organic interaction is something dating companies are aware of, and it has led to a surge in the number of activity events for singles. In 2017, Charlie Spokes set up her own dating business, My Friend Charlie, after a conversation with her mum sparked the idea. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t dating people I met in real life. Whenever I went out, I\u2019d go for dinner, speak to friends and come home,\u201d she explains. \u201cI wanted to start something where people could meet up, enjoy an activity and actually talk to each other.\u201d The company has run more than 150 quirky events across Manchester, London and Bristol, including sunset cycling, quizzes, darts and axe throwing.</p> <p>Paul, a 36-year-old IT consultant from Manchester, has attended several of Charlie\u2019s events. \u201cI gave up with online dating after putting lots of effort into my responses and getting no replies. So far, all the events I\u2019ve tried have been good. You can talk about the activity you\u2019re doing, which breaks the ice, especially if it\u2019s something unusual.\u201d</p> <p>He also believes you get a better picture of a person when you meet face-to-face. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide behind a screen and pretend to be something you\u2019re not. You have to be yourself.\u201d Like Lynn he hasn\u2019t found any dating prospects yet, but remains optimistic.</p> <p>In the past, dating apps, event companies and websites have come under fire for commoditising the search for love. Advertised by pearly toothed sex gods, they charge a heavy premium to find a \u201csoulmate\u201d. And although many websites and event organisers cite great success rates in uniting couples, ultimately they are businesses, not magic love machines. If everyone found their fairytale ending on the first attempt, profits would decline.</p> <p>Jordi Sinclair, who runs Smudged Lipstick Events, says it\u2019s important to be honest about what you are selling. \u201cWe don\u2019t promise anyone they will find love,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe promise to put on great events, where you\u2019ll meet new people and try something different. We have also found that it\u2019s a misconception that all single people are desperately hunting for The One. Sometimes they want to meet other singles with similar interests, especially if lots of their friends are married.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can\u2019t hide behind a screen and pretend to be something you\u2019re not. You have to be yourself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As well as life drawing, Jenga dating and dirty Scrabble, the company runs an open mic night where people can come and share their dating war stories. \u201cWe put a lot of effort into choosing good venues and hosts. We also ban people from using phones to encourage interaction and get everyone talking.\u201d While dating events are increasingly popular in big cities, there are fewer options available for older people and gay singles. \u201cA lot of the experience-based meet-ups aren\u2019t in my area,\u201d explains Lynn. \u201cFor the over-50s, there isn\u2019t much choice and there\u2019s virtually nothing for people in their 60s and older. Dating is a numbers game, but that can be hard when there aren\u2019t many options to meet people who are a similar age to you.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew, 36, a London-based advertising specialist, says there is less variety for same-sex events, too. \u201cI tried a gay-speed-dating event once, but I ended up getting really drunk. The only person I matched with was the man I met outside when I was smoking.\u201d Likening the experience to \u201chuman scrolling\u201d, he found the process artificial and awkward.</p> <p>However, he would be keen to try activity events if more existed for gay singles. \u201cThere are lots of meet-up groups for gay people, but I haven\u2019t seen many fun same-sex events specifically for singles. I\u2019d definitely like to see companies setting these up.\u201d While SpeedDater already offers same-sex events, newer companies including My Friend Charlie and Smudged Lipstick Events are hoping to expand their offering to attract a wider range of people.</p> <p>As for me, I\u2019m determined to put frog man behind me and keep an open mind. I might not meet The One, but there\u2019s always wine, gin and throwing axes at strangers.</p>",

Yet despite people\u2019s preconceptions, the dating app company hasn\u2019t been deterred. It holds 55 events a year, including parties, skiing trips and bingo. The average number of party attendees doubled to more than 300 between 2018 and 2019, suggesting the events are more popular than ever. Meanwhile, more traditional event organisers are also seeing a rise in demand, with SpeedDater running 70 events a month across 23 cities in the UK. \u201cWe are trying to break down the stigma,\u201d says Sarah Payne, the events manager at SpeedDater Events. \u201cThere used to be a big stigma about online dating but that has gone now. It is completely normal to meet online and we\u2019d like to see the same thing happen with events. We do speed dating, but we also run parties, cooking classes and wine tasting.\u201d As people develop \u201capp-based dating fatigue\u201d, singles events are making a comeback. \u201cApps are very appearance-based and events give people the chance to get a better idea of who a person is. People might be unsure about attending them, but then find they enjoy the face-to-face interaction.\u201d Lynn, a 58-year-old life coach from Liverpool, turned to speed dating after becoming disillusioned with Tinder. \u201cA few years ago, people were enthusiastic on apps and wanted to meet up, but that doesn\u2019t seem to happen now,\u201d she explains. \u201cI tried speed dating, because it\u2019s a faster version of apps and you get to meet lots of different people.\u201d Although she hasn\u2019t found any serious romantic prospects, she has had fun and made new friends. \u201cYou can\u2019t take it too seriously or expect too much. You might have to meet a huge number of people to find someone you are actually compatible with.\u201d Some dating companies are putting a spin on singles mixers with events such as naked speed dating or pheromone dating, where people can try to sniff their way to true love. For Alice, 28, a copywriter from Reading, these gimmicks can be fun, but they aren\u2019t likely to lead to love. \u201cI went naked speed dating because I thought it would be something different,\u201d she explains. \u201cUsually, women\u2019s tickets for dating events sell out faster than the men\u2019s tickets, but the opposite was true for this.\u201d She chose to wear her underwear, although many people were naked. While she admits there was a novelty factor, it is not something she will repeat in a hurry. \u201cThere was a weird guy there and a woman told me he was touching himself during the event, which was uncomfortable. I think it might be a good way to meet people if you are into exhibitionism, but I\u2019m not sure it was for me.\u201d Alice is unconvinced that any type of speed dating leads to love. Instead, she prefers to attend general meet-up groups, where there is no pressure to look for a partner. \u201cI think it\u2019s better when things develop organically. Although some dating events have been OK, I tend to find the women are much more up for it and the men aren\u2019t really people I\u2019d go for.\u201d The desire for organic interaction is something dating companies are aware of, and it has led to a surge in the number of activity events for singles. In 2017, Charlie Spokes set up her own dating business, My Friend Charlie, after a conversation with her mum sparked the idea. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t dating people I met in real life. Whenever I went out, I\u2019d go for dinner, speak to friends and come home,\u201d she explains. \u201cI wanted to start something where people could meet up, enjoy an activity and actually talk to each other.\u201d The company has run more than 150 quirky events across Manchester, London and Bristol, including sunset cycling, quizzes, darts and axe throwing. Paul, a 36-year-old IT consultant from Manchester, has attended several of Charlie\u2019s events. \u201cI gave up with online dating after putting lots of effort into my responses and getting no replies. So far, all the events I\u2019ve tried have been good. You can talk about the activity you\u2019re doing, which breaks the ice, especially if it\u2019s something unusual.\u201d He also believes you get a better picture of a person when you meet face-to-face. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide behind a screen and pretend to be something you\u2019re not. You have to be yourself.\u201d Like Lynn he hasn\u2019t found any dating prospects yet, but remains optimistic. In the past, dating apps, event companies and websites have come under fire for commoditising the search for love. Advertised by pearly toothed sex gods, they charge a heavy premium to find a \u201csoulmate\u201d. And although many websites and event organisers cite great success rates in uniting couples, ultimately they are businesses, not magic love machines. If everyone found their fairytale ending on the first attempt, profits would decline. Jordi Sinclair, who runs Smudged Lipstick Events, says it\u2019s important to be honest about what you are selling. \u201cWe don\u2019t promise anyone they will find love,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe promise to put on great events, where you\u2019ll meet new people and try something different. We have also found that it\u2019s a misconception that all single people are desperately hunting for The One. Sometimes they want to meet other singles with similar interests, especially if lots of their friends are married.\u201d As well as life drawing, Jenga dating and dirty Scrabble, the company runs an open mic night where people can come and share their dating war stories. \u201cWe put a lot of effort into choosing good venues and hosts. We also ban people from using phones to encourage interaction and get everyone talking.\u201d While dating events are increasingly popular in big cities, there are fewer options available for older people and gay singles. \u201cA lot of the experience-based meet-ups aren\u2019t in my area,\u201d explains Lynn. \u201cFor the over-50s, there isn\u2019t much choice and there\u2019s virtually nothing for people in their 60s and older. Dating is a numbers game, but that can be hard when there aren\u2019t many options to meet people who are a similar age to you.\u201d Andrew, 36, a London-based advertising specialist, says there is less variety for same-sex events, too. \u201cI tried a gay-speed-dating event once, but I ended up getting really drunk. The only person I matched with was the man I met outside when I was smoking.\u201d Likening the experience to \u201chuman scrolling\u201d, he found the process artificial and awkward. However, he would be keen to try activity events if more existed for gay singles. \u201cThere are lots of meet-up groups for gay people, but I haven\u2019t seen many fun same-sex events specifically for singles. I\u2019d definitely like to see companies setting these up.\u201d While SpeedDater already offers same-sex events, newer companies including My Friend Charlie and Smudged Lipstick Events are hoping to expand their offering to attract a wider range of people. As for me, I\u2019m determined to put frog man behind me and keep an open mind. I might not meet The One, but there\u2019s always wine, gin and throwing axes at strangers.",

Creative movement director Stephen Galloway, a former principal ballet dancer, was hired by Tom Ford this season to stand at the end of the catwalk, behind the photographers, offering advice on movement. \u201cWhen the models get to the end of the runway, that\u2019s when they need to be at their best, that\u2019s the wow moment,\u201d he says.

Meanwhile concern is growing over possible infections among passengers from another cruise liner that docked in Cambodia last week. On Sunday a traveller from the MS Westerdam was confirmed to have the virus in Malaysia, days after disembarking along with hundreds of other passengers. It is not clear how many travellers remain in Cambodia and how many have already travelled on to further destinations. The Cambodian health ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The cruise operator, Holland America Line, told Reuters that guests who had left Cambodia would be \u201ccontacted by their local health department and be provided further information\u201d. It is not clear if passengers will be asked to self-isolate once they return home. Hundreds of American passengers from the Diamond Princess, where travellers have been mostly confined to their cabins since 3 February, have been flown back to the US. Fourteen passengers tested positive during the evacuation, the US state department said. Australia said it would follow suit on Wednesday. Both countries have said citizens will face a further two weeks of quarantine after arriving home. Forty American passengers who were diagnosed with the virus have already been transferred to hospitals in Japan. Some Diamond Princess passengers still on the ship face another two weeks in isolation if they have shared a cabin with someone who tests positive. The total number of people infected around the world climbed to more than 71,000 on Monday, including a further 2,048 confirmed cases in China, where the total number of deaths stands at 1,770. Five people have died outside China. Of the 105 deaths reported in China on Monday, 100 were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak.

Omi conceded that tracing the chain of domestic transmissions not related to the Diamond Princes was proving difficult, but denied that Japan, which has confirmed 65 cases on land, was becoming a second major infection cluster. \u201cOur focus now is on community-based preventive action to lower the speed of the transmission of the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is true that there have been silent transmissions, but Japan is certainly not in a state of pandemic.\u201d A hospital near Tokyo said it was no longer accepting new patients because one of its nurses had tested positive for the virus after treating an infected patient who later died. A member of the diagnosis team from Japan\u2019s health ministry also tested positive for the disease, the ministry said. The virus\u2019s spread in Japan has prompted calls for the government to speed up testing and offer clearer advice on when to seek medical help. Analysts warned of potentially \u201chuge\u201d damage to Japan\u2019s economy, saying the widening fallout from the virus was damaging output and tourism, undermining growth and risking pushing the country into recession. There is concern, too, over the growing number of reported cases in Japan involving people who have not visited China recently or knowingly had direct contact with people arriving from the country. \u201cWe agreed that the present situation represents the early stage of a domestic outbreak. This could progress further,\u201d said Takaji Wakita, the chief of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, after the first meeting of a taskforce at the prime minister\u2019s office. Pressure on Japan\u2019s health services increased again on Monday with the arrival in Tokyo of a government-chartered flight carrying 65 Japanese nationals from Wuhan, bringing the total number repatriated from the Chinese city to 763. Japan\u2019s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, urged the public to avoid crowds and \u201cnon-essential gatherings\u201d, including notoriously packed commuter trains, and said the country was \u201centering a new phase\u201d in the outbreak of the virus. Koji Wada, a professor of public health at the International University of Health and Welfare, told the Asahi Shimbun: \u201cThere is the possibility that the infection may have spread to people well beyond the groups of patients who have been identified.\u201d The government has made extra funds available for emergency countermeasures it says will be in place by the end of March. Employers in Japan are also starting to feel the effects of the outbreak. On Monday, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, one of the country\u2019s biggest firms, said it was urging its 200,000 group employees to work from home or stagger their commutes.

      "body": "<p>One Saturday night, Andrew saw Jenny walk down the steps to the bar in Vienna where he worked. The other bartenders recognised her as a regular, but it was the first time Andrew had seen her. He had left his job as a lawyer, and was picking up shifts in an Irish pub, the now defunct Billy\u2019s Bones. \u201cWe all tried to serve her first,\u201d remembers Andrew. He got there first. She ordered cider and opened a tab. </p> <p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t see because there was a kind of lip under the bar and I wrote down \u2018my future wife\u2019 on the tab,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cAll the other bartenders were like, dream on.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe he wrote it \u201cjust to wind the guys up\u201d, he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t feel that I did. It was a feeling of, \u2018Wow, even in these short few minutes together, this is someone I want to spend more time and, ultimately, the rest of my life with.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He had never felt like that before. Was it love at first sight? \u201cYes and no,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cI just had a feeling that this was an important person and something important was going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Jenny recalls that Andrew was \u201cvery charming\u201d and thanks to a Welsh link \u2013 she is half-Welsh, half-German and Andrew is originally from Wales \u2013 \u201cthere was a bit of a connection straight away\u201d.</p> <p>Did he spend the rest of the evening keeping an eye on her? He laughs. \u201cDon\u2019t make it sound so creepy. Yeah, of course. I think she had two or three ciders over the night. I kept looking over to see who she was with and looking at her drink to see if she needed another one.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t ask for Jenny\u2019s number at closing time. \u201cYou knew I was going to come back,\u201d she says. But he did slip her bar tab into his pocket after cashing up. \u201cSomething made me not throw it in the bin,\u201d he says. \u201cI took it home and put it in a drawer.\u201d</p> <p>Soon afterwards, Jenny, who was a student, started work at the bar too. \u201cWe had shifts together and sometimes went out afterwards,\u201d she says. \u201cWe used to hang out and go dancing or drinking with the other bartenders, or on our own. He used to walk me to the night bus.\u201d</p> <p>They both had partners at the time and weren\u2019t looking for anything else but, Andrew says, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t deny it in the end. There are sausage stands in the city where you can buy hotdogs. I think we fell in love eating sausages in the middle of Vienna.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a8fb548ed551bf9b2c3fcf8a2c74d66da94e296a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8fb548ed551bf9b2c3fcf8a2c74d66da94e296a/0_21_509_399/500.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew and Jenny, at the Irish pub in Vienna in 2003 .\" width=\"500\" height=\"392\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew and Jenny, at the Irish pub in Vienna in 2003 .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image courtesy of Andrew Pullen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jenny remembers becoming more aware of Andrew\u2019s feelings as they walked together to the tram after leaving a nightclub. The sun was coming up and he implied he wanted more than friendship. \u201cI felt nervous, in a nice way,\u201d she says. \u201cButterflies.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew was about to go to Spain for a few weeks, but they stayed in touch by email. \u201cWe expressed a lot of what we felt,\u201d he says. \u201cWe both had the time to think about it and formulate what we wanted to say.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Vienna, they went out on their first official date.</p> <p>Two years later, the couple moved in together and, eight years after meeting, got engaged on holiday in Thailand. \u201cWe were sitting next to each other on the beach, looking at the stars, looking out at the sea,\u201d Jenny recalls. \u201cHe pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to me. I was like, what\u2019s this? I opened it and it was that bar tab from eight years ago, and it said \u2018my future wife\u2019. I knew what was coming \u2026 but that was very emotional.\u201d</p> <p>They married in 2010 and now have two daughters. Is Andrew amazed that he wrote his marriage into existence?

      "bodyText": "One Saturday night, Andrew saw Jenny walk down the steps to the bar in Vienna where he worked. The other bartenders recognised her as a regular, but it was the first time Andrew had seen her. He had left his job as a lawyer, and was picking up shifts in an Irish pub, the now defunct Billy\u2019s Bones. \u201cWe all tried to serve her first,\u201d remembers Andrew. He got there first. She ordered cider and opened a tab. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t see because there was a kind of lip under the bar and I wrote down \u2018my future wife\u2019 on the tab,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cAll the other bartenders were like, dream on.\u201d Maybe he wrote it \u201cjust to wind the guys up\u201d, he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t feel that I did. It was a feeling of, \u2018Wow, even in these short few minutes together, this is someone I want to spend more time and, ultimately, the rest of my life with.\u2019\u201d He had never felt like that before. Was it love at first sight? \u201cYes and no,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cI just had a feeling that this was an important person and something important was going to happen.\u201d Jenny recalls that Andrew was \u201cvery charming\u201d and thanks to a Welsh link \u2013 she is half-Welsh, half-German and Andrew is originally from Wales \u2013 \u201cthere was a bit of a connection straight away\u201d. Did he spend the rest of the evening keeping an eye on her? He laughs. \u201cDon\u2019t make it sound so creepy. Yeah, of course. I think she had two or three ciders over the night. I kept looking over to see who she was with and looking at her drink to see if she needed another one.\u201d He didn\u2019t ask for Jenny\u2019s number at closing time. \u201cYou knew I was going to come back,\u201d she says. But he did slip her bar tab into his pocket after cashing up. \u201cSomething made me not throw it in the bin,\u201d he says. \u201cI took it home and put it in a drawer.\u201d Soon afterwards, Jenny, who was a student, started work at the bar too. \u201cWe had shifts together and sometimes went out afterwards,\u201d she says. \u201cWe used to hang out and go dancing or drinking with the other bartenders, or on our own. He used to walk me to the night bus.\u201d They both had partners at the time and weren\u2019t looking for anything else but, Andrew says, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t deny it in the end. There are sausage stands in the city where you can buy hotdogs. I think we fell in love eating sausages in the middle of Vienna.\u201d Jenny remembers becoming more aware of Andrew\u2019s feelings as they walked together to the tram after leaving a nightclub. The sun was coming up and he implied he wanted more than friendship. \u201cI felt nervous, in a nice way,\u201d she says. \u201cButterflies.\u201d Andrew was about to go to Spain for a few weeks, but they stayed in touch by email. \u201cWe expressed a lot of what we felt,\u201d he says. \u201cWe both had the time to think about it and formulate what we wanted to say.\u201d Back in Vienna, they went out on their first official date. Two years later, the couple moved in together and, eight years after meeting, got engaged on holiday in Thailand. \u201cWe were sitting next to each other on the beach, looking at the stars, looking out at the sea,\u201d Jenny recalls. \u201cHe pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to me. I was like, what\u2019s this? I opened it and it was that bar tab from eight years ago, and it said \u2018my future wife\u2019. I knew what was coming \u2026 but that was very emotional.\u201d They married in 2010 and now have two daughters. Is Andrew amazed that he wrote his marriage into existence? He laughs. \u201cI just wish I could do the same with the lottery numbers \u2013 to be so sure about something and have it pay off.\u201d \u2022 Want to share your story?

      "body": "<p>After a reshuffle, it can be tough to find your bearings. As Alexander Nouri, now the interim head coach of Hertha BSC, felt his way into his new role, with the club\u2019s sporting director Michael Preetz a few seats further down the bench, he didn\u2019t want to tear his eyes from the action in Saturday\u2019s game at Paderborn. Unfortunately, that also meant that when he went to take a seat, which unbeknown to him had flipped up, Nouri sat on fresh air and was left to style out his stumble as best he could.</p> \n<p>It was the only time during his debut on the touchline that Nouri really left anything to chance \u2013 and that\u2019s just the way Hertha wanted it after a week which Preetz described with some understatement as \u201cturbulent\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/jurgen-klinsmann-resigns-as-hertha-berlin-manager-after-10-weeks\">The exit of J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann</a> after 76 days at the helm was in keeping with the rest of his time in charge in Berlin. It was haphazard, rushed and not particularly in keeping with the way the club habitually do business.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/17/lazio-cannot-hide-their-title-ambition-after-fighting-back-past-inter\">Lazio cannot hide their title ambition after fighting back past Inter | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Hertha have been trying to change, though, with the substantial investment and increasing involvement of Lars Windhorst, which allowed them to be the biggest spenders in Europe\u2019s top leagues in the winter transfer window. That\u2019s why so many fans of other clubs have been obliging themselves to (mockingly) call Hertha the \u201cBig City Club\u201d, as Windhorst has tried to help steer them from one of the Bundesliga\u2019s least noteworthy teams to a renewed entity, full of the vibrancy and verve of the capital.</p> \n<p>If ever there was a symbol for that sort of perceived hubris, it was Klinsmann. Originally brought in to sit on Hertha\u2019s advisory board, he took over as head coach in late November when the reign of Ante Covic ran aground. Klinsmann, the decorated former player, national team coach and guru played to type. It was a whirlwind. He filmed the fans, and himself, from the dugout as he arrived for his debut against Borussia Dortmund at the Olympiastadion, surrounded by a pack of photographers, which you don\u2019t see at a Hertha game each week.</p> \n<p>As the club were linked with big (and largely unsuitable) names like Granit Xhaka, Kevin Strootman and Mario G\u00f6tze, he tried to change the culture almost overnight. The tipping point came when it became clear that he wouldn\u2019t get the overarching manager/head of transfers/general figurehead job he wanted, and he quit. He had almost asked Preetz, in effect, to have a position that eclipsed his. The way he suddenly stepped down angered Windhorst to the point that the investor, who loved the idea of the added glamour and potential added sponsorship deals that Klinsmann could bring, quickly made clear he wouldn\u2019t be required back on the board. \u201cThe way he quit is so unacceptable that constructive work between him and everyone else can\u2019t go on,\u201d Windhorst said. \u201cHe lost a lot of his credibility here.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ced6a1f2ad14b6dcfc9422a194d5b74b0ff5bd85\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ced6a1f2ad14b6dcfc9422a194d5b74b0ff5bd85/0_188_3996_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann takes in the atmosphere on his managerial debut for Hertha back in November.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann takes in the atmosphere on his managerial debut for Hertha back in November.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The coaching itself wasn\u2019t for Klinsmann, and it never was. Nouri was brought in to do the tactics, much as Jogi L\u00f6w had done when he led Germany through that sensational 2006 World Cup on home soil.

      "bodyText": "After a reshuffle, it can be tough to find your bearings. As Alexander Nouri, now the interim head coach of Hertha BSC, felt his way into his new role, with the club\u2019s sporting director Michael Preetz a few seats further down the bench, he didn\u2019t want to tear his eyes from the action in Saturday\u2019s game at Paderborn. Unfortunately, that also meant that when he went to take a seat, which unbeknown to him had flipped up, Nouri sat on fresh air and was left to style out his stumble as best he could. It was the only time during his debut on the touchline that Nouri really left anything to chance \u2013 and that\u2019s just the way Hertha wanted it after a week which Preetz described with some understatement as \u201cturbulent\u201d. The exit of J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann after 76 days at the helm was in keeping with the rest of his time in charge in Berlin. It was haphazard, rushed and not particularly in keeping with the way the club habitually do business. Hertha have been trying to change, though, with the substantial investment and increasing involvement of Lars Windhorst, which allowed them to be the biggest spenders in Europe\u2019s top leagues in the winter transfer window. That\u2019s why so many fans of other clubs have been obliging themselves to (mockingly) call Hertha the \u201cBig City Club\u201d, as Windhorst has tried to help steer them from one of the Bundesliga\u2019s least noteworthy teams to a renewed entity, full of the vibrancy and verve of the capital. If ever there was a symbol for that sort of perceived hubris, it was Klinsmann. Originally brought in to sit on Hertha\u2019s advisory board, he took over as head coach in late November when the reign of Ante Covic ran aground. Klinsmann, the decorated former player, national team coach and guru played to type. It was a whirlwind. He filmed the fans, and himself, from the dugout as he arrived for his debut against Borussia Dortmund at the Olympiastadion, surrounded by a pack of photographers, which you don\u2019t see at a Hertha game each week. As the club were linked with big (and largely unsuitable) names like Granit Xhaka, Kevin Strootman and Mario G\u00f6tze, he tried to change the culture almost overnight. The tipping point came when it became clear that he wouldn\u2019t get the overarching manager/head of transfers/general figurehead job he wanted, and he quit. He had almost asked Preetz, in effect, to have a position that eclipsed his. The way he suddenly stepped down angered Windhorst to the point that the investor, who loved the idea of the added glamour and potential added sponsorship deals that Klinsmann could bring, quickly made clear he wouldn\u2019t be required back on the board. \u201cThe way he quit is so unacceptable that constructive work between him and everyone else can\u2019t go on,\u201d Windhorst said. \u201cHe lost a lot of his credibility here.\u201d The coaching itself wasn\u2019t for Klinsmann, and it never was. Nouri was brought in to do the tactics, much as Jogi L\u00f6w had done when he led Germany through that sensational 2006 World Cup on home soil. So for the players, Saturday was the substance minus the drama. \u201cOur spirit was good today,\u201d said captain Niklas Stark. \u201cThere was a good atmosphere on the pitch and on the bench, and it helped us.\u201d Was that a switch from Klinsmann\u2019s reign? \u201cAt any rate, I noticed it today,\u201d Stark replied. Against the bottom team Nouri ostensibly went with a back three, but with Peter Pekarik recalled on the right and Santi Ascascibar sat in front of the defence, it could have easily passed for a back six. In many ways it recalled the dying days of his tenure at Werder Bremen, when Nouri had worked obsessively to improve the famously leaky defence \u2013 sadly, at the cost of any previous attacking inspiration. It was a long way from the bright lights of Klinsmann\u2019s debut. It worked, though. Some will have looked at Hertha\u2019s teamsheet and started muttering about negative Nouri. In reality, the coach was pragmatic enough to know that if he could contain Paderborn\u2019s pace up front, Hertha were always going to get the chances to win. Nouri also put them in a position to take those opportunities, with big signing Krzysztof Piatek joined up front by fellow arrival Matheus Cunha. After Piatek missed a sitter, Cunha almost scored the winner with a tidy backheel \u2013 almost, because it ended up credited as an own goal to Jamilu Collins, whose laudable efforts to clear the Brazilian\u2019s attempt off the line were in vain. That effort, evident in the closing stages with Jordan Torunarigha\u2019s last-ditch challenge on Sebastian Vasiliadis to help secure the points, made you think that maybe Nouri has a chance of holding on to the post \u2013 though Preetz has hardly run away from speculation linking the club with Berlin boy Niko Kovac. Nouri certainly got the support of his old boss. Klinsmann sent a congratulatory WhatsApp to his erstwhile assistant from his home in California, where many would argue he shouldn\u2019t have left in the first place. Adding glamour to Hertha will be an incremental process. It was never, sadly, going to happen at Klinsmann\u2019s pace. Talking points \u2022 Bayern Munich made it a miserable start to Karneval for K\u00f6ln, scoring three times in the opening 12 minutes on their win to a 4-1 win, with Thomas M\u00fcller again outstanding. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the first half,\u201d he said of possibly their most fluent performance this term, \u201cbut it felt really great on the pitch.\u201d \u2022 As he leaned ashen over the advertising hoarding in front of the dugout, it seemed as if Florian Kohfeldt had run out of time.

Every day is intense.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to go through some horrific places in training. You have to suffer some big hits. Suffer some injuries. Suffer some pain. Today I trained twice and it\u2019s an assault on everything. When you\u2019re being choked in the cage it\u2019s horrific, because you feel like you\u2019re drowning. Then someone tries to punch your head off. You\u2019re dealing with take-downs. Unlike boxing, the fight just begins when you\u2019re on the ground. How you land is important. How you get back on your feet and stop them choking or pummelling you is important. You\u2019ve got to be thinking constantly.</p> <p>\u201cAs a rugby player I got into the habit of tackling without thinking. But in MMA you\u2019ve got to land the right way. You can\u2019t flop. You\u2019ve got to bounce back to your feet. You\u2019ve got to use your sprawl. All these things are alien to me so I\u2019m working so hard. You go into the gym and you\u2019re already wrecked. You fight hard again and have to go in the next day and the day after. My life is now dictated by this. I\u2019m doing ice baths up to my neck in freezing water three times a week. I\u2019m doing saunas and cryotherapy. I\u2019m doing massage and physio four times a week. I\u2019m a full-on professional sportsman again.\u201d</p> <p>Training, however, is not the same as fighting and Haskell admits: \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep before my first sparring session on the second of January.

Obviously nobody likes getting hit, but I don\u2019t have a problem with it. In MMA you\u2019ve got to take a few hits to reach the right position. People think of rugby players as being tough but it\u2019s another thing to stand in front of someone and get kicked, punched, taken down. In rugby you have two contact sessions a week and you play a game on the weekend. In MMA, of the five or six days a week that I\u2019m in, four are at peak intensity. I\u2019m as sore and battered as if I played South Africa. You still have your next hard session the very next day. But when you\u2019re learning a skill, and it comes off, there\u2019s no better feeling.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a white middle-class public schoolboy so I\u2019m not particularly tough. But it turns out I don\u2019t mind going in the cage. I can dig in. And it\u2019s interesting watching people spar and train. There\u2019s no anger. It\u2019s all technique and delivered with venom. It\u2019s not hate. But, in a real fight, they want to do damage.\u201d</p> <p>Can Haskell think clearly after he has been hit hard or is in the midst of one of those \u201chorrific\u201d chokes? \u201cIt\u2019s getting better. That\u2019s why you train so hard every day \u2013 so you get used to being uncomfortable. But the choking is different. After a while you feel like you\u2019re drowning. You\u2019ve got to stay comfortable with the horror of it. That\u2019s why the fitness of Khabib [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/07/khabib-conor-mcgregor-fight-crowd-brawl-report\" title=\"\">Nurmagomedov</a>, the UFC lightweight world champion who dominated Conor McGregor] is unbelievable.

But he strives for perfection, and he loves characters, and wants people to succeed.\u201d Does he believe Jones will remain England\u2019s head coach until the 2023 World Cup? \u201cI hope so. All the players love him. After the loss to France, some people said: \u2018Is he going to apologise to the long-suffering England fans?\u2019 What long-suffering England fans? They beat the All Blacks to get to the World Cup final a few months ago. When you\u2019re forceful, and call people on their bullshit, so many want to get you. But he\u2019s brilliant. My experience of England coaches before him have been some of the worst environments I\u2019ve been involved in. Eddie made it the best environment I\u2019ve ever been involved in. He knows how to win and he tells you how to do it.\u201d Haskell enjoyed rugby more than reality television. \u201cPeople forget I played rugby. They go: \u2018Are you James the celebrity?\u2019 or they ask: \u2018Are you from Love Island?\u2019 But I was close to everyone in the jungle. I was very close to Wrighty [Ian Wright] and Caitlyn [Jenner]. Jacqueline [Jossa who won the show] was like my little sister.\u201d Last week Haskell offended many people when, trying to crack a bad joke with her on social media, he suggested Jossa looked like she was \u201cwaiting for the sunshine bus\u201d. It was Haskell at his dumbest, making a jibe involving people with special needs, but he says his jungle experience was \u201can opportunity to make some friends and learn a little about myself\u201d, adding: \u201cAnd to behave properly \u2013 putting women first, having manners, being a leader, being honest and open. That\u2019s what I stand for.\u201d Haskell might be better off sticking to his new career rather than returning to reality TV. Has he got a fight nickname? \u201cNo. What could I call myself? The Cuddler? I just go under James Haskell. I\u2019m focusing on the important stuff \u2013 like trying not to get knocked out. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be a trash-talker. I would rather be humble and let my fighting do the talking. I know, in the fight game, it\u2019s the villains who get paid more money. I\u2019m lucky I\u2019m going into this situation in a different way. I think a few people thought it was a PR stunt. But it\u2019s for real. I\u2019ve given up my life to do this and I want to give a good account of myself as a professional fighter.\u201d Bellator European Fight Series events are televised live on Channel 5 throughout 2020.

      "bodyText": "Moneybarn is to pay nearly \u00a333m in fines and customer compensation after the City regulator found serious breaches in the way the subprime car lender treated vulnerable customers. The Financial Conduct Authority, which fined Moneybarn \u00a32.77m, said the company had not treated customers fairly when they fell behind on repayments. The FCA said the lender, which is owned by the FTSE 250 doorstep lender Provident Financial, also failed to explain the consequences of missing payments in a way that was \u201cclear, fair and not misleading\u201d to borrowers. More than 1,400 customers defaulted on their loans after signing up to Moneybarn\u2019s \u201cunsustainable\u201d short-term repayment plans, the FCA said. The breaches took place between April 2014 and October 2017. Moneybarn has voluntarily paid more than \u00a330m in compensation to 5,933 customers, without asking them to prove they suffered as a result. They received an average of \u00a35,056. It ends a two-year investigation into Provident\u2019s motor finance firm, which provides car loans to people with poor credit history. Provident also owns Vanquis bank, Provident home credit and the payday lender Satsuma. Mark Steward, the executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: \u201cMoneybarn did not give its customers, many of whom were vulnerable, the chance to clear their arrears over a realistic and sustainable period. \u201cIt also did not communicate clearly to customers in financial difficulty their options for exiting their loans and the associated financial implications, resulting in many incurring higher termination costs. These were serious breaches.\u201d The FCA originally planned to fine Moneybarn nearly \u00a34m but reduced the penalty after the firm accepted the regulator\u2019s findings. Provident was one of the poor stock picks by Neil Woodford, a longstanding backer of the doorstep lender before his fund was suspended and subsequently entered liquidation. Moneybarn said it had already covered the costs of the fine and the compensation, having made a provision of \u00a320m for the investigation in 2017 and written off additional costs. The managing director, Shamus Hodgson, said: \u201cWe are happy that all customers potentially affected by these findings have been fully compensated for any detriment they might have suffered. \u201cThe processes we have had in place since 2017 are clear, effective and appropriate.

      "body": "<p>Sudden death causes intense grief and shock. Someone taking their own life is especially hard to cope with \u2013 and the suicide of the TV presenter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/15/former-love-island-presenter-caroline-flack-dies-aged-40\" title=\"\">Caroline Flack</a>, which was announced at the weekend, has unleashed a storm of anguished comment and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/16/caroline-flack-death-turns-spotlight-on-tabloids-once-again\" title=\"\">bitter recriminations</a>.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t easy to pick a way through this maelstrom of emotion. But it needs to be done because what happened to Flack has happened to other people, and it will happen again if all that follows is a few days\u2019 handwringing headlines. That means being absolutely clear about where blame lies \u2013 and where it doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>Flack was arrested in December for an alleged assault on her boyfriend, Lewis Burton, and was due to appear in court again next month. The day after her death, her management company put out an angry statement, accusing the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) of pressing ahead with what it called <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/caroline-flacks-management-criticise-show-trial-of-vulnerable-star-11935319\" title=\"\">\u201ca show trial\u201d</a> after Burton had said he didn\u2019t want the prosecution to continue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/04/prince-harry-meghan-privacy-tabloid-media\">Harry and Meghan are celebrities, but that doesn\u2019t mean they owe us everything | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a fundamental misunderstanding here of how the criminal justice system works. It isn\u2019t up to victims to \u201cpress charges\u201d in this country \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t be. Charging decisions are made by the CPS, and prosecutions for domestic violence sometimes go ahead even when an alleged victim withdraws cooperation.</p> <p>We don\u2019t know what evidence prosecutors would have relied on in this case. But defendants are entitled to be treated as innocent until found guilty, and it\u2019s perfectly possible that Flack would eventually have been cleared.</p> <p>At the same time, there is widespread agreement that too few cases of alleged domestic violence end in prosecutions. The <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/domesticabuseandthecriminaljusticesystemenglandandwales/november2019\" title=\"\">police recorded almost 750,000</a> such crimes in England and Wales in the year ending March 2019 but only 98,470 were referred to the CPS for a charging decision. The proportion that don\u2019t reach court because the victim doesn\u2019t support a prosecution is higher than in non-domestic violence cases \u2013 and increasing.</p> <p>Domestic violence is a scourge, damaging the lives of hundreds of thousands of people (most of them women) each year. Are prosecutors supposed to drop a case because sections of the press have decided to torment the defendant? Do we want the tabloids to have, in effect, a veto on justice? The fact that the accused is famous should have no bearing on whether to continue with a prosecution, and we don\u2019t know what considerations influenced the CPS decision to pursue the case against Flack.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the popular press might have been more cautious if the charge had been serious enough to be heard in a crown court. She faced a single count of assault with beating, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison and is usually heard in a magistrates\u2019 court, where contempt rules are applied less stringently, because there is no jury.</p> <p>It\u2019s unlikely that a first-time offender would receive a custodial sentence, even if convicted. Flack was clearly very upset about being forbidden by the court to contact Burton while the case was pending, but it\u2019s also obvious that few defendants would have been subjected to the onslaught of heartless publicity she had to endure.</p> <p>It was open season on Flack \u2013 an attractive 40-year-old woman with a boyfriend 13 years her junior \u2013 from the moment news of her arrest became public. Of course it always has been, particularly since she opened up about her depression after <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51518042\" title=\"\">winning Strictly Come Dancing</a> in 2014 \u2013 such exposure only whets tabloid and public appetite for further revelations.</p> <p>\u201cBedroom bloodbath\u201d was the headline in the Sun, accompanied by a picture of blood-spattered sheets, which raises questions about how images from the alleged crime scene got into the public domain. The Mirror went for \u201cCaroline Flack\u2019s fall from grace\u201d, making the melodramatic claim that her life was \u201cshrouded with heartache\u201d despite her \u201cstunning body\u201d. Remind me, what\u2019s the tabloid for Schadenfreude?</p> <p>Flack could barely leave her home without having to face photographers. She was mobbed when she arrived at the magistrates\u2019 court in north London shortly before Christmas and made no secret of her fragile emotional state, posting a series of worrying messages on social media. It has emerged that an ambulance was called to her address on Friday, the day before her suicide.</p> <p>Flack\u2019s obvious vulnerability didn\u2019t call off the dogs. Also on Friday, the Sun published an article about a Valentine\u2019s Day card that mocked her, referring to the allegation that she had hit Burton over the head with a lamp.

      "bodyText": "Sudden death causes intense grief and shock. Someone taking their own life is especially hard to cope with \u2013 and the suicide of the TV presenter Caroline Flack, which was announced at the weekend, has unleashed a storm of anguished comment and bitter recriminations. It isn\u2019t easy to pick a way through this maelstrom of emotion. But it needs to be done because what happened to Flack has happened to other people, and it will happen again if all that follows is a few days\u2019 handwringing headlines. That means being absolutely clear about where blame lies \u2013 and where it doesn\u2019t. Flack was arrested in December for an alleged assault on her boyfriend, Lewis Burton, and was due to appear in court again next month. The day after her death, her management company put out an angry statement, accusing the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) of pressing ahead with what it called \u201ca show trial\u201d after Burton had said he didn\u2019t want the prosecution to continue. There is a fundamental misunderstanding here of how the criminal justice system works. It isn\u2019t up to victims to \u201cpress charges\u201d in this country \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t be. Charging decisions are made by the CPS, and prosecutions for domestic violence sometimes go ahead even when an alleged victim withdraws cooperation. We don\u2019t know what evidence prosecutors would have relied on in this case. But defendants are entitled to be treated as innocent until found guilty, and it\u2019s perfectly possible that Flack would eventually have been cleared. At the same time, there is widespread agreement that too few cases of alleged domestic violence end in prosecutions. The police recorded almost 750,000 such crimes in England and Wales in the year ending March 2019 but only 98,470 were referred to the CPS for a charging decision. The proportion that don\u2019t reach court because the victim doesn\u2019t support a prosecution is higher than in non-domestic violence cases \u2013 and increasing. Domestic violence is a scourge, damaging the lives of hundreds of thousands of people (most of them women) each year. Are prosecutors supposed to drop a case because sections of the press have decided to torment the defendant? Do we want the tabloids to have, in effect, a veto on justice? The fact that the accused is famous should have no bearing on whether to continue with a prosecution, and we don\u2019t know what considerations influenced the CPS decision to pursue the case against Flack. Paradoxically, the popular press might have been more cautious if the charge had been serious enough to be heard in a crown court. She faced a single count of assault with beating, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison and is usually heard in a magistrates\u2019 court, where contempt rules are applied less stringently, because there is no jury. It\u2019s unlikely that a first-time offender would receive a custodial sentence, even if convicted. Flack was clearly very upset about being forbidden by the court to contact Burton while the case was pending, but it\u2019s also obvious that few defendants would have been subjected to the onslaught of heartless publicity she had to endure. It was open season on Flack \u2013 an attractive 40-year-old woman with a boyfriend 13 years her junior \u2013 from the moment news of her arrest became public. Of course it always has been, particularly since she opened up about her depression after winning Strictly Come Dancing in 2014 \u2013 such exposure only whets tabloid and public appetite for further revelations. \u201cBedroom bloodbath\u201d was the headline in the Sun, accompanied by a picture of blood-spattered sheets, which raises questions about how images from the alleged crime scene got into the public domain. The Mirror went for \u201cCaroline Flack\u2019s fall from grace\u201d, making the melodramatic claim that her life was \u201cshrouded with heartache\u201d despite her \u201cstunning body\u201d. Remind me, what\u2019s the tabloid for Schadenfreude? Flack could barely leave her home without having to face photographers. She was mobbed when she arrived at the magistrates\u2019 court in north London shortly before Christmas and made no secret of her fragile emotional state, posting a series of worrying messages on social media. It has emerged that an ambulance was called to her address on Friday, the day before her suicide. Flack\u2019s obvious vulnerability didn\u2019t call off the dogs. Also on Friday, the Sun published an article about a Valentine\u2019s Day card that mocked her, referring to the allegation that she had hit Burton over the head with a lamp. It mysteriously disappeared from the paper\u2019s website when her death was announced. There is a haunting sketch of the former TV presenter at Highbury Corner magistrates\u2019 court in December, shoulders slumped and her face half-hidden by a gloved hand. She looks nothing like the glamorous contestant who appeared on Strictly Come Dancing just over five years ago. And that, of course, is the point: when the popular press scents an opportunity to shame a famous woman, compassion and decorum go out of the window. Flack\u2019s tragic death has rightly put the tabloids back in the dock, with some MPs accusing the popular press of hounding her. Labour leadership contender Keir Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions, has said some stories \u201camplified\u201d damaging posts that appeared on social media. It\u2019s almost as if the Leveson inquiry into press intrusion never happened. Once again, a female celebrity is dead in ghastly circumstances and the same questions arise. Was she treated differently from a man in the same situation? Do we trust our institutions, including the criminal justice system and the media, to behave fairly to women and recognise their vulnerabilities? I think it\u2019s pretty obvious that we don\u2019t. Misogyny is still the lens through which well-known women are viewed and Caroline Flack, tragically, is the latest in a long line of victims. \u2022 Joan Smith is a journalist and chair of the mayor of London\u2019s Violence Against Women and Girls Board \u2022 In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

The 77-metre MV Alta drifted for over a year, skirting the Americas, Africa and Europe, rusting and derelict yet resolutely afloat. Its voyage came to an end during Storm Dennis on Sunday when it ran aground near Ballycotton, a fishing village in County Cork, Ireland, overlooking the Celtic Sea. The Alta wedged itself on to rocks, apparently intact. On Monday experts from the local council, the Irish coastguard and Ireland\u2019s commissioner of wrecks were discussing what to do with a visitor that was drawing lots of attention. \u201cCork county council is asking members of the public to stay away from the wreck location as it is situated on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and is in an unstable condition,\u201d the council said in a statement. Environmental scientists who visited the area on Monday did not see visible pollution, the council said. It has asked a marine contractor to board the Alta \u2013 the next opportunity will be on Tuesday at around 7am, during low tide \u2013 for a closer inspection. \u201cAny risk in relation to oil, other hazardous substances and pollution from the vessel will be evaluated.\u201d Built in 1976, the Alta was flagged in Tanzania, changed owner in 2017 and was sailing from Greece to Haiti in September 2018 when it become disabled about 1,380 miles (2,220km) south-east of Bermuda. Unable to make repairs, the 10-strong crew was rescued by the US coastguard cutter Confidence, which brought the crew members to Puerto Rico. According to gCaptain, a maritime industry news site, the US coastguard contacted the ship\u2019s owner to arrange a commercial tug to tow it to shore. It was reportedly towed to Guyana only to be hijacked, with its subsequent fate unclear until August 2019 when a Royal Navy ice patrol ship, HMS Protector, encountered it in the mid-Atlantic, apparently unmanned. It is thought to have later drifted up from Africa and past Spain to Ireland. In ocean lore, the story of the ghost ship the Flying Dutchman is a myth dating from the 1700s. The Mary Celeste, in contrast, was real: it was found abandoned, heading for the strait of Gibraltar in 1872, the crew\u2019s fate a mystery. More recently, in 2006 the tanker Jian Seng was found off the coast of Queensland, Australia, without a crew, the identity of its owner and its origins unclear. In 2016 a wooden houseboat washed ashore on Ireland\u2019s Atlantic coast. Made with driftwood and polystyrene and fitted with solar panels, it turned out to have been built by Rick Small, a Canadian environmentalist who had given the boat away and had no idea how it ended up crossing the ocean unmanned.",

      "bodyText": "The last British member of the European court of justice has said she could sue the EU over an attempt by the bloc\u2019s 27 member states to force her out. Eleanor Sharpston, who is an advocate general to the court in Luxembourg, is set to be replaced by a Greek candidate because of Brexit. Asked whether she might take the EU to the court of justice over her removal, Sharpston said she was considering her case. \u201cI have not made up my mind,\u201d she told the Law Gazette. \u201cIt may be that the very last service I can render to my court is to see whether there is something I can do to push back against the member states intruding into the court\u2019s autonomy and independence.\u201d Shortly before the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, the member states stated that the mandates of all UK-related members of the bloc\u2019s institutions would automatically end on 31 January. Sharpston, whose mandate will end in October 2021, has been told that she will only remain in post until her replacement has been appointed. The number of advocates general, who advise the court\u2019s judges, remains fixed at 11. The EU member states\u2019 position in relation to Sharpston\u2019s tenure is said to be legally doubtful. The court\u2019s statute states the mandate of a serving member can only be terminated for disciplinary reasons, by the court acting unanimously. Sharpston, a fellow of King\u2019s College, Cambridge, and a former joint head of chambers in London, has been at the ECJ since 2006.

      "bodyText": "Nicola Sturgeon has appointed Kate Forbes as Scotland\u2019s first female finance secretary in a mini-reshuffle forced by the abrupt resignation of Derek Mackay earlier this month. Forbes was appointed to the post 11 days after being asked to present the Scottish government\u2019s draft budget for 2020 with about 14 hours\u2019 notice, after Mackay\u2019s sudden resignation following allegations he had repeatedly texted a 16-year-old boy. A Gaelic speaker, Forbes is one of the Scottish parliament\u2019s newest MSPs, arriving at Holyrood in 2016. At 29, she is thought to be the youngest cabinet secretary in the devolved administration\u2019s 20-year history. With the SNP running a minority government, she now has to negotiate a deal with at least one other party to ensure the budget is passed on 5 March. Despite strong pressure to resign as an MSP, including from within the SNP, Mackay is reportedly preparing to return to Holyrood while the party considers his future. Sturgeon appointed Ben Macpherson, another rising star in the Scottish National party\u2019s ranks, who became an MSP in 2016, as Forbes\u2019s replacement as public finance minister, with responsibility for migration and climate policy. Another recent arrival, Jenny Gilruth, has been made minister of Europe and international development in her first government appointment. Gilruth will support Mike Russell, the veteran cabinet secretary for the constitution and European affairs, whose brief has been expanded to include external affairs. Fiona Hyslop, who has held ministerial posts since the SNP first won power in 2007, has been moved to become cabinet secretary for economy, fair work and culture, putting economic policy in the hands of two women for the first time. Fergus Ewing, another veteran SNP figure and a member of the Ewing political dynasty, has been given additional responsibility in the cabinet for tourism as well as being cabinet secretary for the rural economy. Sturgeon said the appointments meant seven out of her 12 cabinet members were women, with a fully gender-balanced government team. \u201cThese appointments bring new talent into government and deliver a real focus, not only on driving forward our economy, but also on addressing the challenges of Brexit, increasing our population and ending Scotland\u2019s contribution to the climate crisis,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>For as long as she can remember, Shahanaz has been running from cyclones. Her family first fled their home in 1970 when it was hit by the devastating Cyclone Bhola, considered one of the deadliest cyclones in history. An estimated <a href=\"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/2e1150b675104f4b90ed4513359030ec\" rel=\"nofollow\">half a million</a> people perished, including Shahanaz\u2019s grandparents. It was a cyclone that triggered a civil war, such was its impact, and prompted the events that would later lead to Bangladesh\u2019s independence.</p> <p>Today, natural disasters continue to shape the politics of social, cultural and economic life in Bangladesh. Situated on the Bay of Bengal, its unique <a href=\"https://coastal.climatecentral.org/map/8/90.0025/23.5657/?theme=sea_level_rise&amp;map_type=coastal_dem_comparison&amp;amp=&amp;elevation_model=coastal_dem&amp;forecast_year=2050&amp;pathway=rcp45&amp;percentile=p50&amp;return_level=return_level_1&amp;slr_model=kopp_2014\" rel=\"nofollow\">geography</a> forms one of the largest deltas in the world; a dense network of tributaries made up of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers, making the country particularly susceptible to extreme weather events. This is further exacerbated by socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, population density and a high dependence on agriculture. The <a href=\"http://www.icccad.net/what-does-the-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-in-bangladesh/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IPCC</a> predicts that by 2050, approximately 27 million people in Bangladesh will be at risk due to the effects of rising sea levels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1938c89d3d8d223ec0a868a5c4711f5f06338906\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1938c89d3d8d223ec0a868a5c4711f5f06338906/0_337_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shahanaz, 32, at her home on the bank of the Kirtankhola River.

To date, she has lived through <a href=\"https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/environment/2017/05/30/major-cyclones-bangladesh/\" rel=\"nofollow\">six major</a> cyclones. \u201cMoving constantly from one place to another is exhausting,\u201d she says. \u201cNowhere feels like home.\u201d She currently lives in a rickety hut made from scrap metal and bamboo, which has been illegally erected on the bank of the Kirtankhola River. When Shahanaz isn\u2019t in danger from cyclones or crippling floods, she is faced with the constant threat of eviction. These dire living conditions also meant her son almost died of typhoid.</p> <p>Climate change affects everyone, but not everyone is affected equally. Due to their limited access to resources and decision-making processes, women in Barishal are among the most vulnerable. With high existing levels of poverty and inequality, climate change is intensifying the everyday challenges that women and girls already face. As the community struggles to cope with the rising frequency of natural disasters, girls are increasingly at risk of early marriage, trafficking and child labour.</p> <p>To address such gender-specific issues, Shahanaz, along with 23 other women, have recently come together to form the Hatkhola Women\u2019s Squad. On a cool, dry winter\u2019s morning, they gather at a small concrete building in the middle of their slum in Barishal. Handwritten scrolls of action plans hang from the wall as Josna, 37, the leader of the squad, provides an update on hygiene concerns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"adf3d210a044367a0b4b8da5fef2cc1adcbe06e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adf3d210a044367a0b4b8da5fef2cc1adcbe06e0/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Josna, 37, leader of the Hatkhola Women Squad, holds a meeting at the Community Disaster Management Committee Center.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josna, 37, leads the Hatkhola Women\u2019s Squad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Farzana Hossen/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Josna leads the Hatkhola Women\u2019s Squad</p></li> </ul> <p>A lack of adequate toilet facilities in the slum is a particular problem for menstruating women and girls. \u201cThere are no washrooms for adolescent girls,\u201d says Josna. \u201cWhen they have their periods, they don\u2019t have any space to change.\u201d She describes the cramped conditions families find themselves in; with brothers, sisters, parents and grandparents often living under the same roof, and only one bathroom between them all.</p> <p>Josna is a mother of three, a wife, and a force for change. Like many women in Barishal, she left school at a young age to help support her family. She noticed early on in life that women were not involved with decision-making and was determined to change that. \u201cWhy should I stand on the sidelines?\u201d she says. \u201cWherever I went before, I used to sit at the back behind the leader. Gradually I thought no. If men can sit at the front, then so can I.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"517998c0495b5f99923d7987824199d53f51a040\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/517998c0495b5f99923d7987824199d53f51a040/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"Kobita, 18, with her one-month-old baby Abdur Rahman at her home in Barishal, Bangladesh.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kobita, 18, with her one-month-old baby Abdur Rahman at her home in Barishal, Bangladesh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Farzana Hossen/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, Josna is president of the Hatkhola community disaster management committee for the <a href=\"http://www.bdrcs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bangladesh Red Crescent Society</a>, where she manages dozens of volunteers working to address key issues affecting their community. Her team is focused on developing the area; improving roads, drains, washrooms and toilet systems, as well as training people in disaster preparedness.</p> <p>The Hatkhola Women\u2019s Squad has received training from the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, with support from the British Red Cross on disaster management and how to be prepared for when the unthinkable happens. So, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/11/cyclone-bulbul-deaths-millions-displaced-india-bangladesh\">Cyclone Bulbul</a> made its way to Barishal in November 2019, the women were ready. The squad was pivotal in making sure those most at risk were protected, including children, the elderly and pregnant women.</p> <p>One of the latter was Kobita, 18, who sits nearby cradling her newborn in a flimsy blanket. Kobita was eight months pregnant when Cyclone Bulbul hit. \u201cMy body was in so much pain that I could barely move. I was terrified for my unborn child \u2013 I didn\u2019t think that we\u2019d make it.\u201d</p> <p>As the water levels started to rise and swept under the tin doors of her hut, Kobita began to panic.</p> <p>Ankle-deep in water, she suddenly heard the mic from the local mosque crackle. But instead of the usual <em>adhan</em> \u2013 the Muslim call to prayer \u2013 a loud, echoey voice declared a state of emergency. Luckily, the Hatkhola Squad soon arrived and slowly escorted Kobita to the emergency shelter. \u201cWe keep a list of the most vulnerable,\u201d says Josna. \u201cKobita was a priority, so we got to her as soon as we could.\u201d</p> <p>The Hatkhola Women\u2019s Squad worked tirelessly through the night, making sure everyone in the slum reached the shelter. They carried small children for those who were struggling and provided regular reassurance to terrified families. After the cyclone had passed, the women helped clear the debris and return families back to their homes. They also arranged for local donations of dry food for the needy and vulnerable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fe6d27b24df11772d2779dffc65d9d9b415f86d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe6d27b24df11772d2779dffc65d9d9b415f86d3/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nur Jahan, 25, with her daughter Tisha, 10.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nur Jahan, 25, with her daughter Tisha, 10.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Farzana Hossen/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Nur Jahan with her daughter Tisha, 10</p></li> </ul> <p>The Hatkhola Women\u2019s Squad offers more than just a safe space for women to learn and grow.

Nipa, 20, is one of the younger members of the group and sees it as an opportunity to challenge cultural stereotypes. \u201cIt\u2019s not common for women to help in such a physical way during an emergency,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like I have much more respect now. Being a member of the Hatkhola Women\u2019s Squad means that I am taken more seriously.\u201d</p> <p>Nipa\u2019s father agrees wholeheartedly: \u201cWithout the support of women, no family can prosper. I\u2019m 100% sure that women are the future success of this community.\u201d</p> <p>And the women also received praise from the local police. Officer Abu Bakar Siddik says: \u201cThe Hatkhola Squad were critical in getting the early warning alerts to the community. We hope this will inspire more women in Barishal to get involved with future search and rescue missions.\u201d</p> <p><em>As we enter unprecedented times, building resilience in vulnerable communities is needed now more than ever. The British Red Cross It Starts With Her campaign is helping thousands of women in Barishal to learn new skills, improve their lives and build communities that stand strong every day and during a crisis.

An estimated half a million people perished, including Shahanaz\u2019s grandparents. It was a cyclone that triggered a civil war, such was its impact, and prompted the events that would later lead to Bangladesh\u2019s independence. Today, natural disasters continue to shape the politics of social, cultural and economic life in Bangladesh. Situated on the Bay of Bengal, its unique geography forms one of the largest deltas in the world; a dense network of tributaries made up of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers, making the country particularly susceptible to extreme weather events. This is further exacerbated by socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, population density and a high dependence on agriculture. The IPCC predicts that by 2050, approximately 27 million people in Bangladesh will be at risk due to the effects of rising sea levels. Shahanaz at her home on the banks of the Kirtankhola River Shahanaz, now 32, has settled in Barishal, south-central Bangladesh, where the cyclones are never too far behind and there are a significant number of slum dwellings. To date, she has lived through six major cyclones. \u201cMoving constantly from one place to another is exhausting,\u201d she says. \u201cNowhere feels like home.\u201d She currently lives in a rickety hut made from scrap metal and bamboo, which has been illegally erected on the bank of the Kirtankhola River. When Shahanaz isn\u2019t in danger from cyclones or crippling floods, she is faced with the constant threat of eviction. These dire living conditions also meant her son almost died of typhoid. Climate change affects everyone, but not everyone is affected equally. Due to their limited access to resources and decision-making processes, women in Barishal are among the most vulnerable. With high existing levels of poverty and inequality, climate change is intensifying the everyday challenges that women and girls already face. As the community struggles to cope with the rising frequency of natural disasters, girls are increasingly at risk of early marriage, trafficking and child labour. To address such gender-specific issues, Shahanaz, along with 23 other women, have recently come together to form the Hatkhola Women\u2019s Squad. On a cool, dry winter\u2019s morning, they gather at a small concrete building in the middle of their slum in Barishal. Handwritten scrolls of action plans hang from the wall as Josna, 37, the leader of the squad, provides an update on hygiene concerns. Josna leads the Hatkhola Women\u2019s Squad A lack of adequate toilet facilities in the slum is a particular problem for menstruating women and girls. \u201cThere are no washrooms for adolescent girls,\u201d says Josna. \u201cWhen they have their periods, they don\u2019t have any space to change.\u201d She describes the cramped conditions families find themselves in; with brothers, sisters, parents and grandparents often living under the same roof, and only one bathroom between them all. Josna is a mother of three, a wife, and a force for change. Like many women in Barishal, she left school at a young age to help support her family. She noticed early on in life that women were not involved with decision-making and was determined to change that. \u201cWhy should I stand on the sidelines?\u201d she says. \u201cWherever I went before, I used to sit at the back behind the leader. Gradually I thought no. If men can sit at the front, then so can I.\u201d Today, Josna is president of the Hatkhola community disaster management committee for the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, where she manages dozens of volunteers working to address key issues affecting their community. Her team is focused on developing the area; improving roads, drains, washrooms and toilet systems, as well as training people in disaster preparedness. The Hatkhola Women\u2019s Squad has received training from the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, with support from the British Red Cross on disaster management and how to be prepared for when the unthinkable happens. So, when Cyclone Bulbul made its way to Barishal in November 2019, the women were ready. The squad was pivotal in making sure those most at risk were protected, including children, the elderly and pregnant women. One of the latter was Kobita, 18, who sits nearby cradling her newborn in a flimsy blanket. Kobita was eight months pregnant when Cyclone Bulbul hit. \u201cMy body was in so much pain that I could barely move. I was terrified for my unborn child \u2013 I didn\u2019t think that we\u2019d make it.\u201d As the water levels started to rise and swept under the tin doors of her hut, Kobita began to panic. Ankle-deep in water, she suddenly heard the mic from the local mosque crackle. But instead of the usual adhan \u2013 the Muslim call to prayer \u2013 a loud, echoey voice declared a state of emergency. Luckily, the Hatkhola Squad soon arrived and slowly escorted Kobita to the emergency shelter. \u201cWe keep a list of the most vulnerable,\u201d says Josna. \u201cKobita was a priority, so we got to her as soon as we could.\u201d The Hatkhola Women\u2019s Squad worked tirelessly through the night, making sure everyone in the slum reached the shelter. They carried small children for those who were struggling and provided regular reassurance to terrified families. After the cyclone had passed, the women helped clear the debris and return families back to their homes. They also arranged for local donations of dry food for the needy and vulnerable. Nur Jahan with her daughter Tisha, 10 The Hatkhola Women\u2019s Squad offers more than just a safe space for women to learn and grow. Many are raising families alone, left by husbands who had no option but to migrate for work. Some leave for Dhaka or Chittagong, while others head to the Gulf states \u2013 more than 700,000 Bangladeshi migrant workers arrived in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman last year alone. Nur Jahan, 25, says her husband left for Oman seven years ago and hasn\u2019t returned since. \u201cWe\u2019ve been married for 13 years but I\u2019ve only seen him for half of that,\u201d she says dejectedly. \u201cMy daughter has forgotten what her father looks like.\u201d Nur Jahan joined the Women\u2019s Squad simply to make friends, but being surrounded by strong, resilient women has increased her own self-confidence. \u201cOn my own, I can achieve only a little. Together we can achieve so much more.\u201d Nur Jahan and Tisha make carton clips to sell The transformative work of these women has inspired others to join. Nipa, 20, is one of the younger members of the group and sees it as an opportunity to challenge cultural stereotypes. \u201cIt\u2019s not common for women to help in such a physical way during an emergency,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like I have much more respect now. Being a member of the Hatkhola Women\u2019s Squad means that I am taken more seriously.\u201d Nipa\u2019s father agrees wholeheartedly: \u201cWithout the support of women, no family can prosper. I\u2019m 100% sure that women are the future success of this community.\u201d And the women also received praise from the local police. Officer Abu Bakar Siddik says: \u201cThe Hatkhola Squad were critical in getting the early warning alerts to the community. We hope this will inspire more women in Barishal to get involved with future search and rescue missions.\u201d As we enter unprecedented times, building resilience in vulnerable communities is needed now more than ever. The British Red Cross It Starts With Her campaign is helping thousands of women in Barishal to learn new skills, improve their lives and build communities that stand strong every day and during a crisis. Every pound donated to the British Red Cross between 10 January and 7 April will be doubled by the UK government, up to the value of \u00a32m. To find out more, visit redcross.org.uk/empowerwomen",

She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. \u201cI am also able to maintain my sons\u2019 educational expenses, which I couldn\u2019t do before \u2013 it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.\u201d Mukhal, 28, is a member of the Rasulpur Women\u2019s Squad Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours. Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. \u201cEverything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don\u2019t want my son to live this kind of life \u2013 I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn\u2019t have to struggle like me.\u201d Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places; worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble. Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (\u00a336.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents\u2019 medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. \u201cThere was blood everywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter a few seconds, I passed out.\u201d Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain \u2013 she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role. \u201cWhat can I expect from this life?\u201d she asks. \u201cI have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.\u201d She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn\u2019t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success; providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach. As we enter unprecedented times, building resilience in vulnerable communities is needed now more than ever. The British Red Cross It Starts With Her campaign is helping thousands of women in Barishal to learn new skills, improve their lives and build communities that stand strong every day and during a crisis. Every pound donated to the British Red Cross between 10 January and 7 April will be doubled by the UK government, up to the value of \u00a32m. To find out more, visit redcross.org.uk/empowerwomen",

The Lazio manager had been in perpetual motion through the final minutes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/16/european-football-roundup-juventus-inter-bayern-munich\">Lazio\u2019s game against Inter</a>, running the touchline with such bellicose vigour that you half expected him to leap into a sliding challenge at any moment. When a ball came out to Milan Skriniar on the near side of the pitch, Inzaghi was quicker to him than any defender.</p> \n<p>Lazio were on the cusp of another landmark victory in a season that has known a few. Inzaghi\u2019s team beat Juventus 3-1 twice in the space of 15 days at the end of 2019, the second of those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/dec/23/suppercopa-lazio-juventus-serie-a\">landing them the Supercoppa</a>. They won 11 consecutive league games from October into January, shattering the club record of nine.</p> \n<p>The deeper into a season you get, however, the weightier these results become. When the final whistle went on Sunday, allowing Inzaghi to charge the field at last, it felt as though we had entered a new chapter. Lazio\u2019s 2-1 win had moved them into second place, above Inter and just one point behind Juventus. No longer could anyone deny they were competing for the title.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1229160161379528705\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83c\udf89 JOYOUS SCENES AT THE OLIMPICO!<br><br>\ud83d\udd35 Lazio hold on to beat Inter 2-1!<br><br>\ud83c\udfc6 20 years on from their last Serie A title, could this be the year for the Biancocelesti?<br><br>\u2b06 Inzaghi's team are up to 2nd, one point behind Juve, while Inter fall to 3rd <a href=\"https://t.co/rRYVZg5h6f\">pic.twitter.com/rRYVZg5h6f</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1229160161379528705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 16, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Inzaghi acknowledged as much before the night was through. \u201cLooking at the table, it\u2019s normal to talk about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know the progress we\u2019ve made these past few years. Now we need to stay there, recognising that every Sunday can set you up for a fall.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lazio looked in danger of suffering one this weekend, after Ashley Young volleyed Inter ahead in the 44th minute. It had been a close-fought first half, with both teams fashioning chances, but to fall behind so close to the interval might have derailed a less confident side. As the teams entered the tunnel, almost 10,000 away fans at the Stadio Olimpico were making themselves heard.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/17/chelseas-mario-pasalic-set-to-join-atalanta-for-125m-in-summer\">Chelsea's Mario Pasalic set to join Atalanta for \u00a312.5m in summer</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Inzaghi, though, felt no need to chastise his players. \u201cWe played the first half with such a certainty that we were going to win that a few inevitable counter-attacks were inevitable,\u201d he reflected. \u201cI praised the team anyway, telling them that if we kept it up, we would have a chance to turn things around.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was an easy sermon to preach, to a room that had been here and done it before. Lazio conceded the first goal in their league win over Juventus, too. Against Atalanta, in October, they were 3-0 down after 68 minutes, and came back to draw 3-3.</p> \n<p>\u201cTwo things are certain in life,\u201d posted Sergej Milinkovic-Savic on Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B7MRp8sizG3/?utm_source=ig_embed\">last month</a>. \u201cDeath, and Lazio never giving up.\u201d For him, at least, these are not just hollow words. Milinkovic-Savic had scored the goal that got Lazio in front against Juventus, and he would repeat the trick on Sunday.</p> \n<p>First came an equaliser gift-wrapped by Inter. Skriniar lunged to intercept a ball into the box, sending it up into the air. Inter\u2019s goalkeeper, Daniele Padelli, came late off his line and tripped over his teammate\u2019s leg. Diego God\u00edn had a chance to head the ball clear but timed his jump poorly and allowed Milinkovic-Savic to knock it down. Stefan De Vrij then went into the back of Ciro Immobile.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The striker made the most of the contact, and another referee might have dismissed appeals for a penalty. This one, Gianluca Rocchi, had a clear view and pointed to the spot. De Vrij did clearly put his hands on Immobile before their feet got tangled, so there was no chance of VAR overturning the decision. Immobile converted for his 26th goal of this campaign.</p> \n<p>Lazio\u2019s supporters enjoyed this moment all the more for seeing De Vrij brought low.

      "bodyText": "Simone Inzaghi finished Sunday night with a torn pair of trousers. The Lazio manager had been in perpetual motion through the final minutes of Lazio\u2019s game against Inter, running the touchline with such bellicose vigour that you half expected him to leap into a sliding challenge at any moment. When a ball came out to Milan Skriniar on the near side of the pitch, Inzaghi was quicker to him than any defender. Lazio were on the cusp of another landmark victory in a season that has known a few. Inzaghi\u2019s team beat Juventus 3-1 twice in the space of 15 days at the end of 2019, the second of those landing them the Supercoppa. They won 11 consecutive league games from October into January, shattering the club record of nine. The deeper into a season you get, however, the weightier these results become. When the final whistle went on Sunday, allowing Inzaghi to charge the field at last, it felt as though we had entered a new chapter. Lazio\u2019s 2-1 win had moved them into second place, above Inter and just one point behind Juventus. No longer could anyone deny they were competing for the title. Inzaghi acknowledged as much before the night was through. \u201cLooking at the table, it\u2019s normal to talk about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know the progress we\u2019ve made these past few years. Now we need to stay there, recognising that every Sunday can set you up for a fall.\u201d Lazio looked in danger of suffering one this weekend, after Ashley Young volleyed Inter ahead in the 44th minute. It had been a close-fought first half, with both teams fashioning chances, but to fall behind so close to the interval might have derailed a less confident side. As the teams entered the tunnel, almost 10,000 away fans at the Stadio Olimpico were making themselves heard. Inzaghi, though, felt no need to chastise his players. \u201cWe played the first half with such a certainty that we were going to win that a few inevitable counter-attacks were inevitable,\u201d he reflected. \u201cI praised the team anyway, telling them that if we kept it up, we would have a chance to turn things around.\u201d It was an easy sermon to preach, to a room that had been here and done it before. Lazio conceded the first goal in their league win over Juventus, too. Against Atalanta, in October, they were 3-0 down after 68 minutes, and came back to draw 3-3. \u201cTwo things are certain in life,\u201d posted Sergej Milinkovic-Savic on Instagram last month. \u201cDeath, and Lazio never giving up.\u201d For him, at least, these are not just hollow words. Milinkovic-Savic had scored the goal that got Lazio in front against Juventus, and he would repeat the trick on Sunday. First came an equaliser gift-wrapped by Inter. Skriniar lunged to intercept a ball into the box, sending it up into the air. Inter\u2019s goalkeeper, Daniele Padelli, came late off his line and tripped over his teammate\u2019s leg. Diego God\u00edn had a chance to head the ball clear but timed his jump poorly and allowed Milinkovic-Savic to knock it down. Stefan De Vrij then went into the back of Ciro Immobile. The striker made the most of the contact, and another referee might have dismissed appeals for a penalty. This one, Gianluca Rocchi, had a clear view and pointed to the spot. De Vrij did clearly put his hands on Immobile before their feet got tangled, so there was no chance of VAR overturning the decision. Immobile converted for his 26th goal of this campaign. Lazio\u2019s supporters enjoyed this moment all the more for seeing De Vrij brought low. Nobody had forgotten his infamous final game for the club, in which he gave away a penalty that helped Inter \u2013 the team he had already agreed to join \u2013 to leapfrog the Biancocelesti into Serie A\u2019s last Champions League spot. Still, their second goal was more artful. Adam Marusic\u2019s volley from a corner was cleared off the line by Marcelo Brozovic, but broke to Milinkovic-Savic near the penalty spot. Romelu Lukaku was closing in fast, but the Serbian dragged the ball away under his heel as he turned to place a shot into the bottom corner. It was majestic technique from Milinkovic-Savic, reminding us yet again that his 6ft 3in frame is no hindrance to doing work in tight spaces, and also a fitting reward for another colossal performance in the middle of the park. Lazio\u2019s rise this season is a triumph of the collective, rather than any individual, yet his return to top form has been a key piece of the puzzle. Named as Serie A\u2019s Midfielder of the Year last season, Milinkovic-Savic was nevertheless widely perceived to have had a disappointing campaign. He himself commented in May \u2013 shortly before winning the award \u2013 that he was unsatisfied with his performances. A player who had been valued \u2013 very loudly \u2013 at over \u20ac100m by Lazio\u2019s owner, Claudio Lotito, the previous summer no longer seemed to have the attention of any club who might stump up such a sum. Perhaps that was for the best. Lazio\u2019s gain is obvious, but Milinkovic-Savic is profiting, too, from the opportunity to develop in a team that has enjoyed extraordinary continuity in its playing staff, under a manager who is emerging as one as Italy\u2019s best. Together, they have a chance to make history. Lazio last won the Scudetto in 1999-2000, under Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson. Like Rome, that triumph was not built in a day. It was a season earlier that the Swede established their now-broken record of nine consecutive Serie A wins, on the way to a second-place finish. A runners-up spot this season would hardly qualify as a disappointment for Lazio, whose priority has always been simply to make it back into the Champions League after more than a decade away. Still, the opportunity to do something greater is becoming very real. Lazio cannot hide their title ambition, any more than Inzaghi could the hole in his trousers.

The new station will be available on national DAB digital radio but will also try to take advantage of the rapid growth of smart speakers which are making it easier to try new stations. The BBC is under enormous pressure, both structurally and politically. Over the weekend the Murdoch-owned Sunday Times ran an anonymous Downing Street briefing which said the licence fee was under threat and that the government wanted to shut down or sell off every BBC radio station other than Radio 3 and Radio 4. Pienaar said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a huge pleasure and a great privilege to work at the Beeb. Now, I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled about joining the greatest and oldest title in journalism \u2013 in such a new and ambitious project on the digital frontline. The guiding aim is to offer listeners high-quality discussion and analysis of the stories and issues of the day, and make it a compelling, enjoyable listen. I can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When he was widowed after almost 35 years of marriage, it seemed as if my dad might not find anyone else to love again. My mum was his first relationship, he had no experience of dating and, even if he had, the dating ecosystem had changed out of all recognition since the days of my parents\u2019 romance in the 70s. There were, of course, plenty of dating apps, subscription sites, singles\u2019 activities and old-fashioned blind dates to contend with, but for him the choice was overwhelming. He would rather have settled for being alone.</p> <p>Five years after my mum\u2019s death, however, with our father\u2019s stubborn reluctance well and truly established, my brother and I decided to take matters into our own hands. Taking advantage of the effects of the wine we had drunk for his birthday dinner, we downloaded Lumen \u2013 an app marketed as \u201cTinder for over-50s\u201d \u2013 to his phone. Then we did an impromptu photoshoot and employed our best copywriting skills to sell him to the lucky ladies in a 10-mile vicinity.</p> <p>It took him a while to overcome the initial awkwardness of online messaging. He struggled to understand that most people prefer some informal chat before meeting up: he scared off some suitors by suggesting coffee straight away. After a few months of swiping, messaging and meeting up with strangers, he met someone who is now his partner.</p> <p>With the numbers of single over-50s <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/populationestimatesbymaritalstatusandlivingarrangements/2002to2017#an-increasing-proportion-of-50-to-64-year-olds-are-single-never-married-and-cohabitation-for-this-group-is-becoming-more-common\" title=\"\">growing in the UK</a>, matchmaking for our parents is an increasingly likely prospect, and one that can be just as fraught as it is rewarding. For Jack (not his real name), the sudden death of his father in 2007 was devastating for him and his 58-year-old mother. \u201cMy mother suddenly found herself a widow, and since my dad was the love of her life, she was so lonely \u2013 and terrified at the idea of spending retirement on her own,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I suggested internet dating, which was in its infancy at the time, but she wouldn\u2019t contemplate it \u2013 she was too shy and I think she thought it may have been a bit vulgar, too.\u201d Feeling helpless at the prospect of his mother\u2019s solitary retirement, Jack decided to set up a page on a dating site without her knowing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea3b37813ef24b00beb0efe95394ed5e5b0680b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea3b37813ef24b00beb0efe95394ed5e5b0680b3/0_17_8333_5002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dating in later life can be puzzling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dating in later life can be puzzling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian Design; Yuji Sakai/EMS-FORSTER-PRODUCTIONS/MoMo Productions/Dougal Waters/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLooking back, it was a very rash thing to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI even set her age as a couple of years younger than she was because she has always looked young. But, just before I was going to launch the page, my girlfriend at the time persuaded me I had to come clean, and at least get my mum\u2019s blessing.\u201d There followed an awkward confession during which Jack persuaded his mum to give it a try for two months. \u201cShe went on a few dates, but didn\u2019t meet anyone special and let her membership lapse,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was until she checked back on her email alerts from the site and saw a photo of a widower, James, and decided to pay the \u00a37 rejoining fee.\u201d</p> <p>Jack was none the wiser until his mum introduced James to him as her boyfriend four months later. \u201cI was shocked and elated,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were clearly such a good match, and had hit it off after meeting up through the site. They ended up getting married in 2012, and my mum says that was the best \u00a37 she ever spent. I\u2019m glad I signed her up in the first place and that she was brave enough to take the plunge.\u201d</p> <p>Julia Godoy\u2019s parents had been separated for more than 10 years when, last summer, her 50-year-old mother decided to venture into the online dating world. \u201cShe was very close to a man, and they had a complicated relationship in which they were friends. But perhaps she hoped for more, and then in the summer she found out he was in a relationship and had been lying to her the whole time. She felt really betrayed and lost,\u201d says Godoy. \u201cBut a friend of hers who is always on dating apps persuaded her to give it a try to help her move on and take back some control.\u201d</p> <p>Godoy helped her mother, who was living in France, set up a profile on the French website Meetic, where she had paid for a three-month membership. Then they waited for the dates to start rolling in. \u201cI was so surprised when she decided to sign up because my mum is usually shy and very private,\u201d Godoy says. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad she has taken that step.\u201d Now two months into her subscription, her mum has been on a handful of dates. \u201cShe still feels awkward about it all, but I want her to keep trying,\u201d she says. \u201cIt must all be very intimidating \u2013 even I have never signed up to any of the apps or sites \u2013 but all you can do is just be supportive to your parents and help them move on when they\u2019re ready. I feel optimistic that she will meet someone soon \u2013 she deserves to.\u201d</p> <p>Before internet dating was an option, Gillian Ross was matchmaking her widowed mother in a more traditional manner. In 1976, Ross, then 16, worked as a bookkeeper in an office where she met an older colleague, Derek. \u201cI was hopeless at my job, and Derek was always so kind in offering to help me,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes, when I was walking home, he would see me and offer me a lift in his car and if we saw my mum walking back from her job at a nearby bacon factory, he\u2019d stop to pick her up.\u201d Initially assuming Derek was married because of the neat packed lunch he would bring into work each day, Ross found out that he was divorced with two children, and encouraged her mum to set up a date with him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Derek came along, and it was another lease of life for Mum \u2013 I think she\u2019d given up before then</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ross says: \u201cI was writing out Christmas cards that year, and I said to my mum: \u2018Why don\u2019t we send one to Derek and ask him to come for a drink on Boxing Day?\u2019 But she was too embarrassed, and refused. She thought it would be too pushy.\u201d Ross sent the card anyway, and when Derek replied saying he would love to come, the relationship began. \u201cThey started going out together every other weekend and getting to know each other \u2013 it was so nice to just see her happy with someone. My mum had a really rough time of it. My father died when I was seven and my brother not much older, so she was left with a massive responsibility. Then Derek came along and it was another lease of life for her \u2013 I think she\u2019d given up before then.\u201d</p> <p>The couple remained together for 38 years before Derek died of a brain tumour in 2015. \u201cWhen Derek was dying, he took my hand and said: \u2018Your mum gave me the happiest years of my life \u2013 I didn\u2019t start living until I met her.\u2019 They stayed as in love as when they had first met, and it was lovely to know that I had picked him out all those years ago. He really became a dad to me, too.\u201d</p> <p>Ross is herself divorced, and often finds her two children now trying to act as matchmaker for her. \u201cPeople say to me: \u2018Why don\u2019t you go on Tinder?\u2019 But I\u2019m just not into it \u2013 I\u2019d much rather meet people the old-fashioned way,\u201d she says. \u201cMy kids have tried to set me up a couple of times because they would like to see me with someone again, but most of the decent men seem to be taken. If I don\u2019t meet anyone, that\u2019s fine by me, but, to be honest, I wish they would set me up more!\u201d</p>",

Five years after my mum\u2019s death, however, with our father\u2019s stubborn reluctance well and truly established, my brother and I decided to take matters into our own hands. Taking advantage of the effects of the wine we had drunk for his birthday dinner, we downloaded Lumen \u2013 an app marketed as \u201cTinder for over-50s\u201d \u2013 to his phone. Then we did an impromptu photoshoot and employed our best copywriting skills to sell him to the lucky ladies in a 10-mile vicinity. It took him a while to overcome the initial awkwardness of online messaging. He struggled to understand that most people prefer some informal chat before meeting up: he scared off some suitors by suggesting coffee straight away. After a few months of swiping, messaging and meeting up with strangers, he met someone who is now his partner. With the numbers of single over-50s growing in the UK, matchmaking for our parents is an increasingly likely prospect, and one that can be just as fraught as it is rewarding. For Jack (not his real name), the sudden death of his father in 2007 was devastating for him and his 58-year-old mother. \u201cMy mother suddenly found herself a widow, and since my dad was the love of her life, she was so lonely \u2013 and terrified at the idea of spending retirement on her own,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I suggested internet dating, which was in its infancy at the time, but she wouldn\u2019t contemplate it \u2013 she was too shy and I think she thought it may have been a bit vulgar, too.\u201d Feeling helpless at the prospect of his mother\u2019s solitary retirement, Jack decided to set up a page on a dating site without her knowing. \u201cLooking back, it was a very rash thing to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI even set her age as a couple of years younger than she was because she has always looked young. But, just before I was going to launch the page, my girlfriend at the time persuaded me I had to come clean, and at least get my mum\u2019s blessing.\u201d There followed an awkward confession during which Jack persuaded his mum to give it a try for two months. \u201cShe went on a few dates, but didn\u2019t meet anyone special and let her membership lapse,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was until she checked back on her email alerts from the site and saw a photo of a widower, James, and decided to pay the \u00a37 rejoining fee.\u201d Jack was none the wiser until his mum introduced James to him as her boyfriend four months later. \u201cI was shocked and elated,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were clearly such a good match, and had hit it off after meeting up through the site. They ended up getting married in 2012, and my mum says that was the best \u00a37 she ever spent. I\u2019m glad I signed her up in the first place and that she was brave enough to take the plunge.\u201d Julia Godoy\u2019s parents had been separated for more than 10 years when, last summer, her 50-year-old mother decided to venture into the online dating world. \u201cShe was very close to a man, and they had a complicated relationship in which they were friends. But perhaps she hoped for more, and then in the summer she found out he was in a relationship and had been lying to her the whole time. She felt really betrayed and lost,\u201d says Godoy. \u201cBut a friend of hers who is always on dating apps persuaded her to give it a try to help her move on and take back some control.\u201d Godoy helped her mother, who was living in France, set up a profile on the French website Meetic, where she had paid for a three-month membership. Then they waited for the dates to start rolling in. \u201cI was so surprised when she decided to sign up because my mum is usually shy and very private,\u201d Godoy says. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad she has taken that step.\u201d Now two months into her subscription, her mum has been on a handful of dates. \u201cShe still feels awkward about it all, but I want her to keep trying,\u201d she says. \u201cIt must all be very intimidating \u2013 even I have never signed up to any of the apps or sites \u2013 but all you can do is just be supportive to your parents and help them move on when they\u2019re ready. I feel optimistic that she will meet someone soon \u2013 she deserves to.\u201d Before internet dating was an option, Gillian Ross was matchmaking her widowed mother in a more traditional manner. In 1976, Ross, then 16, worked as a bookkeeper in an office where she met an older colleague, Derek. \u201cI was hopeless at my job, and Derek was always so kind in offering to help me,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes, when I was walking home, he would see me and offer me a lift in his car and if we saw my mum walking back from her job at a nearby bacon factory, he\u2019d stop to pick her up.\u201d Initially assuming Derek was married because of the neat packed lunch he would bring into work each day, Ross found out that he was divorced with two children, and encouraged her mum to set up a date with him. Ross says: \u201cI was writing out Christmas cards that year, and I said to my mum: \u2018Why don\u2019t we send one to Derek and ask him to come for a drink on Boxing Day?\u2019 But she was too embarrassed, and refused. She thought it would be too pushy.\u201d Ross sent the card anyway, and when Derek replied saying he would love to come, the relationship began. \u201cThey started going out together every other weekend and getting to know each other \u2013 it was so nice to just see her happy with someone. My mum had a really rough time of it. My father died when I was seven and my brother not much older, so she was left with a massive responsibility. Then Derek came along and it was another lease of life for her \u2013 I think she\u2019d given up before then.\u201d The couple remained together for 38 years before Derek died of a brain tumour in 2015. \u201cWhen Derek was dying, he took my hand and said: \u2018Your mum gave me the happiest years of my life \u2013 I didn\u2019t start living until I met her.\u2019 They stayed as in love as when they had first met, and it was lovely to know that I had picked him out all those years ago. He really became a dad to me, too.\u201d Ross is herself divorced, and often finds her two children now trying to act as matchmaker for her. \u201cPeople say to me: \u2018Why don\u2019t you go on Tinder?\u2019 But I\u2019m just not into it \u2013 I\u2019d much rather meet people the old-fashioned way,\u201d she says. \u201cMy kids have tried to set me up a couple of times because they would like to see me with someone again, but most of the decent men seem to be taken. If I don\u2019t meet anyone, that\u2019s fine by me, but, to be honest, I wish they would set me up more!\u201d",

Starting in Kinsale in County Cork, yacht crews sail to a succession of challenging hills, including the highest in Ireland, and finally, after running the Brandon Ridge, finish the race in a pub in Dingle in County Kerry. It is possible to charter a yacht locally, or to join another crew in the race. \u2022 Team entry \u00a3400, ISAMAC-race.com Robert McCaffery Family canoe thrills, France Our favourite outdoor adventure was the 13km canoe descent down the H\u00e9rault river, near Montpellier, France. Four hours on the water might sound like a daunting prospect, but the stunning surroundings are enough to distract from those throbbing arm muscles. The descent features fairytale wooded pathways, thrilling waterfalls (a welcome break from paddling) and calm lakes for a break to have lunch and sunbathe. The canoes come equipped with waterproof barrels for belongings. \u2022 \u20ac23pp, canoelemoulin.fr Caroline Climb an active volcano, Stromboli, Italy Last year we climbed Stromboli, Mount Etna\u2019s smaller but more active cousin, on one of the seven Aeolian Islands rising out of the sea off Sicily\u2019s north-eastern coast. We set off at 4pm accompanied by a guide and equipped with helmets, extra layers, food and water. After four hours of hiking amid thunderous booms and plumes of smoke, we reached the summit as the sun set. We sat along the crater\u2019s edge in the darkness and observed nature\u2019s most impressive firework display. A truly awe-inspiring experience. \u2022 magmatrek.it Julia Harris Wild swimming in Windermere, Lake District Wild swimming fans can\u2019t do better than a summer solstice night-time dip as the sun sets over the Lake District\u2019s biggest lake on the longest day. Starting at the National Trust\u2019s Fell Foot lakeshore park, participants gather at 9.30pm and plunge into the water for a noncompetitive swim, with glowsticks attached to wetsuits (optional) as darkness descends. The effort is rewarded with a glass of Pimm\u2019s and a medal for all. I did it in 2018 with nervous friends, and all were suitably wowed by the views and balmy water temperatures. \u2022 sleekerswim.co.uk Christine Peacock Cycling the Netherlands with teens I cycled the length of the Netherlands in six days with my daughters \u2013 one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done. I am in my early 50s and rode 600km with my two girls (who were in their late teens) from the southernmost tip of the country to the northernmost part. We followed the maps in the book Het Fietserpad. We meandered through the most remote areas, often close to the German border, and for some hours through Germany. The scenery was surprisingly varied. We carried camping gear, but after a few days realised there were plenty of reasonably priced hotels. Good touring bikes can be rented, from places including train stations, for less than \u20ac10 per day. Mark Mountain running, Bosnia-Herzegovina In 2018, I ran 350km across the Dinaric Alps of Bosnia-Herzegovina, border to border, solo and unsupported, wildcamping in the mountains \u2013 which could be a world first. This year, I will return to do the next leg from Montenegro to Albania. I am not a runner, just an enthusiastic woman and outdoor therapist out to prove anything is possible for anyone. Ruth Allen Cuillins Ridge, Skye, Hebrides Towards the southern end of the Cuillin Ridge (which includes the peaks Sg\u00f9rr nan Gillean and Sg\u00f9rr Alasdair), the Inaccessible Pinnacle isn\u2019t quite as foreboding as the name suggests. Found at the top of Sg\u00f9rr Dearg, it forms the summit of the only Scottish Munro that requires a roped climb and abseil. You can hike up to the top of Sg\u00f9rr Dearg and enjoy the spectacular views without the climb, but conquering the exposed rock face makes it a true adventure. The Scottish right to roam means you can wild camp at the base of the Cuillins and even enjoy a dip in the famous Fairy Pools to help your sore muscles recover.

For Cathay, the virus marks another blow after a torrid 12 months in which the street protests in Hong Kong had already caused major traffic declines. Traffic to Hong Kong fell by 46% year on year in November and December, a steeper drop than the 40% seen in January, when the virus was first identified. The airline had already asked its 27,000 employees to take unpaid leave to help reduce costs and it faces the prospect of months of disruption ahead. Cathay had cut 30% of flights before Monday\u2019s announcement. Ronald Lam, the airline\u2019s chief customer and commercial officer, said: \u201cThis was the most challenging Chinese new year period we have experienced. As the novel coronavirus outbreak in mainland China intensified towards the end of the holiday period, travel demand dropped substantially.\u201d Travel bans imposed by many governments across the world resulted in continued cancellations by passengers. The airline said cuts to flight numbers were likely in April as well. The airline\u2019s overall traffic fell by 3.1% in January but performance \u201cdeteriorated rapidly\u201d in the last week of the month, when the severity of the outbreak became clear. The coronavirus outbreak has affected an array of companies around the world. Moody\u2019s Investors Service, the influential credit ratings agency, on Sunday revised down its outlook for 2020 global growth by 0.2 percentage points because of the disruption. \u201cExtended lockdowns in China would have a global impact, given the country\u2019s importance and interconnectedness in the global economy,\u201d said Madhavi Bokil, a vice-president at Moody\u2019s. \u201cThe toll on the global economy would be severe if the rate of infections does not abate and the death toll continues to rise. If the outbreak persists, the domestic and international supply chain disruptions are likely to become significant, amplifying the shock to the global economy.\u201d The mining group Petra Diamonds said on Monday that reduced sales of the precious stones during the lunar new year period were denting its finances, with the virus delaying its efforts to improve cash flow, resulting in $50m (\u00a338m) less than expected by June 2022. Petra also warned there could be volatility in diamond prices as the outbreak exacerbated global economic uncertainty.",

      "bodyText": "An indigenous leader leading his people\u2019s effort to reclaim ancestral land in Costa Rica has been wounded in a gun attack \u2013 the latest in a spate of targeted violence which has gone unpunished by authorities. Mainor Ortiz Delgado, 29, a leader of the Bribri indigenous people in Salitre, Puntarenas province, was shot in the right leg earlier this month \u2013 the third time Ortiz has been shot allegedly by members of the same family in 14 months. The suspected gunman, who carried out the gun attack in broad daylight in front of Delgado\u2019s 13-year-old son, was detained but released within 24 hours. Costa Rica, an eco-tourism hub with 5 million inhabitants, is Central America\u2019s safest and most equitable country. But in recent years, the Bribri people attempting to recoup lost land have been subject to dozens of violent attacks, racist harassment and trumped-up retaliatory lawsuits with almost total impunity. As a result, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued precautionary measures in 2015, calling on Costa Rican authorities to protect the lives and physical integrity of the Bribri and their indigenous neighbours, the Br\u00f6r\u00e1n people. But the violence continued because the state failed to take action, according to Vanessa Jim\u00e9nez, a lawyer with the not-for-profit organization Forest Peoples Programme who works with the indigenous communities. This latest gun attack comes less than a year after 59-year-old Sergio Rojas Ortiz, an internationally acclaimed Bribri land and human rights defender, was shot dead at home in Salitre following years of death threats, harassment and assaults linked to his work. At the time, the government acknowledged the growing violence against the country\u2019s indigenous peoples involved in conflicts with mestizo families who have illegally occupied their ancestral lands, and pledged to deliver justice. Rojas Ortiz\u2019s killers remain at large, and the land disputes remain unresolved. \u201cThe state has relinquished its duty and has abandoned these indigenous people to seek justice in the court system which also fails them,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez told the Guardian. \u201cThe impunity has empowered those who want to do harm to the Bribri and Br\u00f6r\u00e1n.\u201d Latin America is the most dangerous continent in the world to defend land rights and natural resources, and indigenous and rural communities bear the brunt of the violence. Costa Rica has eight indigenous ethnic groups totalling 105,00 people, according to the latest census, who represent approximately 2.4% of the total population. There are 24 legally recognised indigenous territories, which are exclusively for indigenous communities with historical ties to the land. Families who settled on these lands before the 1977 Indigenous Act was enacted are considered \u201cgood faith\u2019 illegal settlers who are entitled to compensation and relocation by the government. Those who occupied the land after the law was passed are considered \u201cbad faith\u201d settlers with no right to recourse. But the law has never been implemented, and the land never returned. Frustrated by the lack of progress, the Bribri in Salitre and the Br\u00f6r\u00e1n in neighbouring T\u00e9rraba, have taken matters into their own hands, and retaken possession of some homes and land through non-violent occupations. The response, on the other hand, has often been violent. In 2013, Ortiz was attacked by 10 men who tortured him with a hot cattle branding iron, and shot him, lodging a bullet in his left thigh. He was also shot in 2019. His mother, Mariana Delgado Morales, said: \u201cThey want to kill my son and the government has known of his precarious situation, but they do nothing effective and meaningful to protect him. I fear he will end up like Sergio [Rojas Ortiz].\u201d Last year, Magdalena Figueroa Morales, a Bribri elder, was seriously injured after a disgruntled neighbour threw liquid pesticide in her face.

In Chicago, the Service Employees International Union Healthcare Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Kansas (SEIU) is launching a campaign to organize hospital workers to ensure a $15 minimum wage extends to workers outside the city limits of Chicago, where the promise of such a rise has already been won. According to the SEIU, there are about 50,000 low-wage hospital workers throughout the Chicago metro area and about 10,000 are currently represented by the union. LeChrisha Pearson, a single mother and certified nursing assistant for eight years at Chicago\u2019s Mount Sinai hospital, was one of about 400 workers at the hospital who organized a union in June 2019, and threatened to strike in November 2019 before winning a contract that would raise wages for all workers to $15 an hour. She works two to three jobs, including as a delivery driver for Uber Eats, to make ends meet while working full-time at the hospital. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure every hospital worker across the city has a voice when it comes to making decisions in the workplace,\u201d added Pearson. \u201cIt\u2019s just starting, but it\u2019s a campaign that needs to expand throughout the healthcare system as a whole.\u201d As part of the campaign, four unionized hospitals in the Chicago area will be fighting for new union contracts to address issues rampant throughout the hospital industry, including low pay, poor working conditions, unaffordable healthcare and inequities in hospital funding. \u201cWe work in the healthcare field, but we can\u2019t afford the healthcare ourselves.

She has recently received threats of a lawsuit due to an inability to pay for medical debt she accrued after an emergency room visit to the hospital where she has worked at for 16 years. Northwestern did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story. One of the union\u2019s organizing targets are hospital workers at Aurora Healthcare, who are not yet unionized. Bill Gentry has worked as an EMT and CNA for 23 years at Advocate Aurora Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Illinois.

Meanwhile in Las Vegas, hospital workers are fighting against proposed cuts in their latest union contract with Valley Hospital Medical Center, owned by UHS, one of the largest hospital chains in the US. Pat Porchia worked as an environmental services attendant at Valley Hospital Medical Center for 23 years before she was fired along with two other union stewards in November 2019. \u201cThey fired three of us on the union committee in one week,\u201d Porchia said. \u201cI knew they were getting ready to fire me.

Unfair labor practice charges for the firings filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) are currently under review. A spokesperson for the Valley Health System declined to comment on Porchia\u2019s termination or union contract negotiations.

The Israeli firm\u2019s hacking technology is alleged to have been used to target journalists, academics and human rights campaigners. NSO has denied the allegations and said its technology is used by its clients to pursue crime and terrorism.</p> \n<p>The decision to host Hikvision could cause new tensions between the UK and the US just weeks after Boris Johnson\u2019s government approved a plan to allow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/28/the-guardian-view-on-huawei-and-5g-the-risks-are-real\">Huawei, the controversial Chinese telecommunications equipment maker</a>, to supply 5G equipment to the UK. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/29/uk-chance-relook-huawei-5g-decision-mike-pompeo\">The US had staunchly lobbied against the deal, which it said was a security risk</a>.</p> \n<p>Although the UK sought to address the protest by limiting Huawei\u2019s share of the new market to 35%, the deal has riled the White House, with the vice-president, Mike Pence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/mike-pence-hints-uks-huawei-decision-could-jeopardise-trade-talks\">suggesting it could delay a US-UK trade agreement</a>.</p> \n<p>The Farnborough event is a closed trade show that will take place from 3-5 March.

      "bodyText": "The UK government is to promote a Chinese surveillance company that has been blacklisted by the US after it was \u201cimplicated\u201d in human rights violations of the country\u2019s Uighur Muslim minority. The Home Office has agreed to allow Hikvision, a surveillance equipment provider active in China\u2019s western Xinjiang province, to attend the Security and Policing trade fair it is hosting in Farnborough in March. A Conservative backbencher called on government departments to rethink the invitation, which comes a few months after the Trump administration accused Hikvision of helping with \u201chigh-technology surveillance against Uighurs\u201d. Hikvision was one of nine companies due to attend the event that had been accused of threatening human rights, according to an analysis of the 300 companies listed to attend, conducted by the internet research company Top10VPN and shared with the Guardian. The Tory MP Bob Seely said he hoped the Home Office would reconsider the invitation. \u201cWe need to stop having an ethical bypass when it comes to China and hi-tech. If we are going to proclaim UK values and standards, we need at least the appearance of consistency.\u201d Last week, the Guardian reported that the British government was to host NSO Group at the trade event. The Israeli firm\u2019s hacking technology is alleged to have been used to target journalists, academics and human rights campaigners. NSO has denied the allegations and said its technology is used by its clients to pursue crime and terrorism. The decision to host Hikvision could cause new tensions between the UK and the US just weeks after Boris Johnson\u2019s government approved a plan to allow Huawei, the controversial Chinese telecommunications equipment maker, to supply 5G equipment to the UK. The US had staunchly lobbied against the deal, which it said was a security risk. Although the UK sought to address the protest by limiting Huawei\u2019s share of the new market to 35%, the deal has riled the White House, with the vice-president, Mike Pence, suggesting it could delay a US-UK trade agreement. The Farnborough event is a closed trade show that will take place from 3-5 March. The Home Office has said the event allowed the UK to deepen \u201cour strong security alliances around the world and for our international partners to understand and hear about the work we are doing to keep our country secure\u201d. The Home Office did not respond directly to the human rights concerns raised, but said the UK operated stringent arms controls. \u201cThe government will do all it can to help keep British people and British interests safe in the UK and overseas,\u201d a spokesman added. The US National Security Council and the US Department of State did not respond to a request for comment. One Washington trade expert suggested the UK move to include Hikvision \u2013 and promote its use to other countries \u2013 would further rankle the Trump administration, which fears the company\u2019s technology could be used for surveillance of allies. The Department of Commerce announced last October that Hikvision was one of 28 entities it had determined to be operating \u201ccontrary to foreign policy interests of the US\u201d, and placed it on an \u201centity list\u201d, which subjects the companies to review of exports, among other restrictions. A US government filing on the issue said the listed entities had been \u201cimplicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups\u201d in the Xinjiang region. Hikvision is valued at about $42bn (\u00a331.7bn), and is one of the world\u2019s largest makers of video surveillance gear. It is estimated to generate about $7bn of its revenue from overseas. A spokesperson for the company said it strongly opposed the commerce department\u2019s decision and it \u201crespects human rights and takes our responsibility to protect people seriously\u201d. The company told the Guardian it had been engaged with officials in the US, UK, and EU over the past year to \u201cclarify misunderstandings about the company and address their concerns\u201d.",

ITV confirmed that Sunday\u2019s episode of Love Island would not be broadcast but the current series would continue on Monday.

Due to patient confidentiality we cannot comment further.\u201d Labour leadership contender Keir Starmer criticised mainstream outlets for \u201camplifying\u201d damaging social media posts about Flack, and signalled he would take action to \u201cdiversify\u201d the press if he won the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. The former director of public prosecutions said the presenter\u2019s death \u201cshocked a lot of people\u201d, adding: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just social media, it was the media amplifying what social media was doing. It was both strands. There is a human impact. \u201cThe press more widely have to take responsibility as well. Not just for the hatred and abuse but for the vilification constantly of Labour MPs and Labour leaders. We have got to do something to diversify our press, to have a better media.\u201d Fellow leadership contender Lisa Nandy said social media companies could not be left to police themselves, suggesting the current situation was like the \u201cWild West\u201d. \u201cI worry about the approaches that say we allow the social media companies to regulate themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cIn no other area of life would we allow private companies to police themselves. We ought to make sure the state has a system of regulation and support around that.\u201d The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, in a media round on Sunday on behalf of the government, also referred to the results of the Online Harms white paper consultation, which looked at ways of better protecting children and vulnerable people. Shapps said he did not know the full circumstances of the case but there should also naturally be a duty of care from the Crown Prosecution Service. Speaking to Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday, he said: \u201cOf course there is a duty of care for everybody involved in these things but I think we need to be pretty careful at this stage. We don\u2019t know the circumstances as yet. Daisy Cooper MP, who worked for the campaign group Hacked Off before being elected in December, said there must be more self-regulation before content is published online. The Lib Dem politician said: \u201cThe hounding of Caroline Flack shows that parts of the British media continue to wreak havoc on people\u2019s lives. \u201cIn Britain we have trial by courts and not trial by media for a reason. Regardless of what took place she should not have been hounded to death by tabloid newspapers desperate for clickbait. \u201cThe government must stop dragging its feet in introducing independent self-regulation of online and offline publishers.\u201d The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who is also responsible for mental health services, tweeted: \u201cSo sad to see the news of Caroline Flack\u2019s suicide. Shows we must do so much more as a society to look out for each other \u2013 whether online or off.\u201d Tory health minister Nadine Dorries, who is responsible for suicide prevention, posted online: \u201cEvery life lost by suicide is a complete tragedy \u2026 so many people will feel as though they lost someone they knew well, and who so many loved. My thoughts are with the family of Caroline Flack.\u201d Labour MP Kate Osamor, who appeared in the press herself for a threatening confrontation with journalists who went to her home after her son was convicted of serious drug offences, wrote: \u201cThe trolling &amp; abuse she suffered at the hands of the media was relentless. Being kind is so underrated. RIP Caroline flack.\u201d Flack\u2019s partner, Lewis Burton, a 27-year-old tennis player who had not supported bringing the case against her, paid tribute to her on Instagram: \u201cMy heart is broken \u2026 I am so lost for words I am in so much pain I miss you so much.\u201d Flack presented many of UK television\u2019s biggest reality TV shows and their spin-offs, from The X Factor to I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here Now!, and won the BBC show Strictly Come Dancing in 2014. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 February 2020 to correct a location detail. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Gone are Wasson\u2019s visions of \u201cthe archetypes, the platonic ideas, that underlie the imperfect images of everyday life\u201d. In their place: the clinking of coffee mugs filled with mushroom tea; giggling and group-hugging on yoga mats; tearful sobbing by participants listening to music through wireless Apple AirPods; and people sinking into Patagonia vests repurposed as makeshift pillows.</p> <p>Back in the Goop headquarters (or \u201clab\u201d), Paltrow speaks of psilocybin as the newest, hottest \u201chealing modality\u201d. Mushrooms, as one researcher tells the Gooper-in-Chief, \u201care back\u201d.</p> <p>And in their current iteration, they\u2019re also totally uncool.</p> <p>For most people, psychedelic drugs like psilocybin and LSD are singularly associated with the 1960s American youth culture. The English psychiatrist Humphrey Osmond coined the term \u201cpsychedelic\u201d \u2013 meaning, roughly, \u201cmind-manifesting\u201d \u2013 in 1956 to describe the effects of hallucinogenic drugs taken in a clinical context. The word, for Osmond, was \u201cclear, euphonious and uncontaminated by other associations\u201d.</p> <p>But the history of psychedelics and psychedelia (that is, the culture that has coalesced around the drugs and their usage) can itself feel somewhat contaminated by certain associations. Even the phrase \u201cpsychedelic 60s\u201d slips so naturally off the tongue, encouraged as much by the pleasing (euphonious, even) sibilance as the cliches conjured in the collective memory: San Francisco, Sgt Pepper, Woodstock, tie-dye, and Timothy Leary urging youngsters to \u201cturn on, tune in, and drop out\u201d. Beyond these more obvious, ready-made cultural signifiers, psychedelics helped catalyze the 80s British rave scene, facilitate Bob Dylan\u2019s more introspective lyrical turn, and helped Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Dock Ellis <a href=\"https://www.si.com/mlb/2017/06/12/dock-ellis-acid-no-hitter-pittsburgh-pirates-anniversary\">throw a legendary no-hitter</a>.</p> <p>Whether these things are at all fascinating or \u201ccool\u201d is, perhaps, a matter of taste \u2013 dependent on one\u2019s tolerance for kaleidoscopic tapestries, all-night dance parties, woolly talk about self-transcendence, and freeform electric guitar jamming. But the so-called \u201cpsychedelic renaissance\u201d that Goop seized upon feels like part of a larger, concerted attempt, to break free of these associations. It\u2019s part reset, part rebranding effort.</p> <p>Recently, Canadian businessman and TV personality Kevin O\u2019Leary (the no-nonsense Mr Wonderful from ABC\u2019s entrepreneurial cavalcade Shark Tank) announced that he had invested in a neuro-pharmaceutical company dedicated to exploring the clinical benefits of psychedelics in treating addiction. Like Paltrow, who waxes on the potential of psychedelics in a process she calls the \u201coptimization of self\u201d, O\u2019Leary \u2013 an investor who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/magazine/kevin-oleary-is-unmoved-by-your-tears.html\">has spoken to the role Ayn Rand\u2019s Atlas Shrugged</a><em> </em>played in shaping his business acumen \u2013 doesn\u2019t exactly seem like an avatar of free love, mind-expansion, and other platitudes of the psychedelic sixties. And that\u2019s precisely the point. If we are now expected to take psychedelics seriously, they must appear, well, serious.</p> <p>Parsing Goop\u2019s sundry claims to pseudoscience and utter quackery feels like low hanging fruit. (Paltrow\u2019s company had to pay damages in 2018 after a court ruled that the benefits of a $66 jade egg, advertised on the Goop website for its role in supporting vaginal health, were unsupported by <a href=\"http://go.health.com/?id=58287X1356702&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=13.26.2-stackpath&amp;sref=https://www.health.com/condition/sexual-health/jade-egg-goop&amp;url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-goop-settlement-20180904-story.html&amp;xguid=&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=300&amp;xuuid=b0492ceef3cbb83bee109ec4eaf8282f\">\u201ccompetent and reliable scientific evidence\u201d.</a>) In the case of magic mushrooms, however, the science seems solid.

      "bodyText": "On a June evening in 1955, an investment banker and amateur mycologist named Robert Gordon Wasson found himself in an adobe house high in the mountains of Oaxaca, Mexico, encountering the divine. That night, Wasson, his wife, the photographer Allan Richardson and about 20 local indigenous people took part in a Mazatec ritual involving psilocybe mexicana, a species of hallucinogenic mushroom. As Wasson recounted in Seeking the Magic Mushroom, his 1957 Life magazine photoessay: \u201cWe chewed and swallowed these acrid mushrooms, saw visions, and emerged from the experience awestruck.\u201d In the first episode of The Goop Lab, a new Netflix docuseries tied to actor Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle and e-commerce enterprise, several of Paltrow\u2019s employees fly to a Jamaican resort, in search of some modern analogue to Wasson\u2019s psychedelic ceremony. The volunteers for Goop\u2019s psilocybin ritual \u2013 a hodgepodge of hand-me-down indigenous liturgy, weekend-long Pilates retreat, and hollow self-help blather \u2013 are all described as being \u201cdeeply successful\u201d people. Gone are Wasson\u2019s visions of \u201cthe archetypes, the platonic ideas, that underlie the imperfect images of everyday life\u201d. In their place: the clinking of coffee mugs filled with mushroom tea; giggling and group-hugging on yoga mats; tearful sobbing by participants listening to music through wireless Apple AirPods; and people sinking into Patagonia vests repurposed as makeshift pillows. Back in the Goop headquarters (or \u201clab\u201d), Paltrow speaks of psilocybin as the newest, hottest \u201chealing modality\u201d. Mushrooms, as one researcher tells the Gooper-in-Chief, \u201care back\u201d. And in their current iteration, they\u2019re also totally uncool. For most people, psychedelic drugs like psilocybin and LSD are singularly associated with the 1960s American youth culture. The English psychiatrist Humphrey Osmond coined the term \u201cpsychedelic\u201d \u2013 meaning, roughly, \u201cmind-manifesting\u201d \u2013 in 1956 to describe the effects of hallucinogenic drugs taken in a clinical context. The word, for Osmond, was \u201cclear, euphonious and uncontaminated by other associations\u201d. But the history of psychedelics and psychedelia (that is, the culture that has coalesced around the drugs and their usage) can itself feel somewhat contaminated by certain associations. Even the phrase \u201cpsychedelic 60s\u201d slips so naturally off the tongue, encouraged as much by the pleasing (euphonious, even) sibilance as the cliches conjured in the collective memory: San Francisco, Sgt Pepper, Woodstock, tie-dye, and Timothy Leary urging youngsters to \u201cturn on, tune in, and drop out\u201d. Beyond these more obvious, ready-made cultural signifiers, psychedelics helped catalyze the 80s British rave scene, facilitate Bob Dylan\u2019s more introspective lyrical turn, and helped Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Dock Ellis throw a legendary no-hitter. Whether these things are at all fascinating or \u201ccool\u201d is, perhaps, a matter of taste \u2013 dependent on one\u2019s tolerance for kaleidoscopic tapestries, all-night dance parties, woolly talk about self-transcendence, and freeform electric guitar jamming. But the so-called \u201cpsychedelic renaissance\u201d that Goop seized upon feels like part of a larger, concerted attempt, to break free of these associations. It\u2019s part reset, part rebranding effort. Recently, Canadian businessman and TV personality Kevin O\u2019Leary (the no-nonsense Mr Wonderful from ABC\u2019s entrepreneurial cavalcade Shark Tank) announced that he had invested in a neuro-pharmaceutical company dedicated to exploring the clinical benefits of psychedelics in treating addiction. Like Paltrow, who waxes on the potential of psychedelics in a process she calls the \u201coptimization of self\u201d, O\u2019Leary \u2013 an investor who has spoken to the role Ayn Rand\u2019s Atlas Shrugged played in shaping his business acumen \u2013 doesn\u2019t exactly seem like an avatar of free love, mind-expansion, and other platitudes of the psychedelic sixties. And that\u2019s precisely the point. If we are now expected to take psychedelics seriously, they must appear, well, serious. Parsing Goop\u2019s sundry claims to pseudoscience and utter quackery feels like low hanging fruit. (Paltrow\u2019s company had to pay damages in 2018 after a court ruled that the benefits of a $66 jade egg, advertised on the Goop website for its role in supporting vaginal health, were unsupported by \u201ccompetent and reliable scientific evidence\u201d.) In the case of magic mushrooms, however, the science seems solid. Researchers at NYU, London\u2019s Imperial College, and Johns Hopkins University, have produced reams of reputable evidence pointing to psilocybin\u2019s role in easing depression, PTSD, anxiety, and even addiction. Such research marks a resurgence of these substances in a clinical context \u2013 a resurgence arguably unseen since the \u201960s cocktail of hedonistic recreational excess and resulting social panic stripped psychedelics of any lingering reputability. If the current surge of serious interest in psychedelics is, in any meaningful way, a \u201crenaissance\u201d, then it\u2019s not reviving the cultural heyday of hippies, Hell\u2019s Angels, campus protests and free outdoor rock concerts, but an earlier period in these drugs\u2019 history. Before these powerful substances fell into the hands of hippies, they were largely evangelized by doctors, executives, and academics \u2013 including the above-mentioned Osmond, and author Aldous Huxley, who firmly believed that the psychedelic experience be made available only to an elite coterie of achievers. Even Wasson, one of the earliest known white Americans to partake in a psychedelic sacrament, returned to work as a high-level executive of an investment bank. Like Goop\u2019s Gwyneth Paltrow, Shark Tank\u2019s Kevin O\u2019Leary, and other current vanguards of the contemporary psychedelic vogue, such early evangelists were very much part of the establishment the \u201960s cohort opposed: deeply successful people whose minds required, if not perspective-shattering expansion, then just a little optimization.

Director Michael Winterbottom\u2019s new satire shows us wealth in all its vanity, venality and vulgarity, as flaunted by Steve Coogan\u2019s besieged fashion tycoon \u2013 a thinly veiled Philip Green (there\u2019s a mental image for you), with hints of Richard Branson, Richard Caring and Nero. Greed \u2013 scornful of modern excess and mindful of exploitation \u2013 is just the kind of parable we need right now. But movies have been sending out decidedly mixed messages about billionaires recently. Take a look at Michael Bay\u2019s latest outspaffing, 6 Underground, in which Ryan Reynolds plays a billionaire-playboy-genius type who assembles a vigilante squad dedicated to taking out \u201ctruly world-class evil motherfuckers\u201d, however many frantically edited action set-pieces it takes. He could probably make the world a better place just by paying his taxes, but hey. Reynolds\u2019s hero is clearly modelled on that other billionaire-playboy-genius role model of our age: Marvel\u2019s Tony Stark, who \u2013 as we all know \u2013 is a fantasy version of Elon Musk, except with more civic responsibility and fewer \u201cpedo-guy\u201d jokes.

The club has issued a statement saying that it has \u201cnever accommodated\u201d use of the \u201cY-word\u201d, and considers the definition \u201cmisleading\u201d.</p> <p>The Y-word is clearly different from \u201cain\u2019t\u201d, and \u201cveganaise\u201d, of course. As a word that in its derogatory sense represents a form of hate speech, it causes grave offence. Words for different categories of people always present complex challenges for dictionaries, especially when the people in those categories discriminate against each other. \u201cYid\u201d started out as a self-referential word for Jewish people in Yiddish, a heritage language for many European Jews (still the first language of some Haredi Jews). Borrowed into the English of non-Jews, it took on a derogatory flavour in the 1930s. Its later application to Spurs fans by supporters of opposing clubs was a hostile act arising from a culture of antisemitism. But \u2013 as has happened for other terms in recent decades \u2013 the slur has been reclaimed by some of its former victims. As Martin Cloake and Alan Fisher wrote in their history of the club: \u201cSpurs supporters \u2026 became Yids in adversity through a complex and contested process of identity formation. Forced to respond to pejorative, abusive taunts from rival supporters, many in the crowd embraced the term in order to render the abuse impotent.\u201d In <a href=\"https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2019/december/y-word-consultation-update/\" title=\"\">a survey of Spurs supporters last year</a>, 33% claimed to use Yid regularly in football contexts, but \u201calmost half\u201d of those surveyed felt that the word should be used less or not at all. Among Jewish Spurs fans, 16% would like the \u201cY-word\u201d to be chanted less and 26% not at all. However, 58% did not object to its use, giving a picture of a very complicated word.</p> <p>Every time people say that a word or meaning \u201cdoesn\u2019t belong\u201d in a dictionary, lexicographers sigh a little. Dictionary writers share a vocation to record a particular language as it is used rather than how anyone, whether Peta or Spurs, would like it to be used. This is especially true of the OED, which is designed as a tool for the historical study of the language, recording evidence of changes in English words and meanings over the past thousand years. It\u2019s worth noting that at this point Oxford Dictionaries has included the \u201cSpurs supporter\u201d definition of the Y-words only in the OED, a subscription-based service intended for those engaged in historical and linguistic research. It does not appear in its web-searchable online products, which are designed for everyday use by people learning or using the language.</p> <p>There are good reasons for wanting a warts-and-all record of the language. Though offensive words may be pushed out of use, they will survive in many of the places where they have been printed, including in journalism, fiction, correspondence and diaries. Future readers will be as puzzled by the slang of our time as we might be by the mention of yellow boys (gold coins) in Dickens, and dictionaries should be there to help. There\u2019s also good reason for recording that Y-words are used by different people to derogate and to celebrate, regardless of what is authorised by Tottenham Hotspur. If dictionaries record the usage of only the authorities, the voices of the people are lost. Should \u201cyid\u201d be alleged as a weapon in a hate-speech crime, it will be important to have a record of, and to appreciate, the complexity of its history.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean that the protests are unwarranted or unwelcome. Despite any temptation to sigh and point to the academic motivations for recording such words, protests are productive for the improvement of dictionaries. They are particularly welcome where they concern the dignity of those to whom the words refer. This is nothing new. In 1924, the Jewish Chronicle took issue with Oxford Dictionaries\u2019 inclusion of a derogatory use of the word Jew to mean \u201can unscrupulous usurer\u201d, prompting the dictionary to label the usage as \u201copprobrious\u201d and to provide explanatory notes about the history of the word\u2019s usage, as well as its meanings. Last year, the <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/my-black-is-beautiful--a-platform-powered-by-procter-and-gamble--challenges-dictionaries-to-redefineblack-300862191.html\" title=\"\">#RedefineBlack campaign</a> led Dictionary.com to reorganise its entry for \u201cblack\u201d. Lexicographers, while well intentioned, often come from groups that suffer less from the slinging of slurs. Whether or not the OED\u2019s definition of Y-words will ever please Spurs, at least a conversation is happening about what dictionaries could do better.</p> <p>\u2022 Lynne Murphy is professor of linguistics at the University of Sussex and author of The Prodigal Tongue: the Love\u2013Hate Relationship between British and American English</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 and 25 February 2020.

In the 1960s, distaste for the treatment of \u201cnon-standard\u201d vocabulary such as \u201cain\u2019t\u201d in Merriam-Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary was so vociferous that a hostile takeover of the company was attempted, and after that failed a competitor dictionary was founded. The price of used copies of the 1934 Second International Dictionary skyrocketed as customers rejected the dictionary\u2019s approach to controversial usages. These days dictionary protests come and go with less drastic effects but greater regularity. Critiquing dictionary definitions gives social and political campaigns focus and attention \u2013 as in a 2019 campaign by the animal-rights organisation Peta calling on Dictionary.com to revise its definition of \u201canimal\u201d. Publishers\u2019 PR departments can also catalyse controversy. The most innovative and zeitgeisty dictionary additions are highlighted in quarterly press releases about dictionary revisions, perhaps in hope of viral attention. It works. When the Collins Dictionary added plant-based foods, including \u201cveganaise\u201d, last year, the Times asked if readers thought such words \u201cdesecrat[e] the way we speak\u201d. Another kind of case has emerged in recent days. Tottenham Hotspur has shown the yellow card to the Oxford English Dictionary for its new definitions of the words \u201cyid\u201d and \u201cyiddo\u201d. While the dictionary records both words as usually offensive terms for Jewish people, it now also describes them as nicknames for Spurs supporters, noting that the fan-directed usage is \u201coriginally and frequently derogatory and offensive, though also often as a self-designation\u201d.

News of the multiple bids to unseat AOC, however, came as a surprise to many voters on the streets of her district in the Bronx last week.</p> <p>Some voters still had not heard of the progressive superstar. Others said they would weigh the merits of her rivals as the contests heat up over the summer. But most voiced support, arguing that almost two years since Ocasio-Cortez threw a grenade at the Democratic establishment by ousting incumbent Joe Crowley, her progressive agenda \u2013 touting universal healthcare and a Green New Deal \u2013 was only now taking hold in the nation\u2019s political capital.</p> <p>\u201cGive her a chance! We knew who she was when we sent her, that she\u2019d make a noise, and making a noise was why we sent her,\u201d said local businessman Abdul Abbas.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s done good things for the Bronx,\u201d concurred Carol Heraldo. \u201cI like how she presents herself as woman, that she\u2019s firm, that she took what she believed and made it real. We don\u2019t see a lot of young people accomplish a lot because they\u2019re afraid \u2013 and she\u2019s not afraid.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We knew who she was when we sent her, that she\u2019d make a noise, and making a noise was why we sent her</p> <footer> <cite>Abdul Abbas</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s not how all see it. The first-term congresswoman is facing eight Republican and five Democratic candidates aiming to unseat her. Some appear symbolic, with little fundraising potential or appetite for collecting the necessary 4,000 signatures to get on the ballot.</p> <p>At her first campaign rally on Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez said she hoped to multiply turnout by four, reaching 60,000 votes in the primary election. She declined to be drawn on the challengers that have lined up to contest her seat.</p> <p>\u201cI think everyone has a right [to run]. I of course won my seat with a primary,\u201d she told the New York Post. \u201cI would never begrudge anyone trying to run in a primary.\u201d</p> <p>Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Republican challengers certainly seem to have their work cut out for them. In 2018 she steamedrolled the Republican candidate by a margin of 78%.</p> <p>With about $3.4m in her campaigns re-election coffers in a solidly Democratic district, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Republican challengers probably plan on merely damaging her or securing a bigger national media profile by taking on such a famed opponent.</p> <p>John Cummings, a former police officer, raised $425,000 in 10 weeks after announcing his candidacy for the Republican nomination on Fox &amp; Friends. Jamaican immigrant Scherie Murray gave her first interview to Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity and raised a similar amount.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3375f9ea790077ce351536ab5abc6b2194aeae06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3375f9ea790077ce351536ab5abc6b2194aeae06/0_205_3096_1858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks at a rally for Bernie Sanders in Venice, California, on 19 December 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks at a rally for Bernie Sanders in Venice, California, on 19 December 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Monterrosa/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But having led a campaign to prevent Amazon from establishing a headquarters in neighboring Long Island City, and established herself as a leading member of \u201cthe Squad\u201d, the self-described group of progressive congresswomen that includes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilhan_Omar\" title=\"Ilhan Omar\">Ilhan Omar</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota\" title=\"Minnesota\">Minnesota</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayanna_Pressley\" title=\"Ayanna Pressley\">Ayanna Pressley</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts\" title=\"Massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashida_Tlaib\" title=\"Rashida Tlaib\">Rashida Tlaib</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan\" title=\"Michigan\">Michigan</a>, Ocasio-Cortez is a political target.</p> <p>In a district that hasn\u2019t voted Republican in half a century, the Republican candidates are tackling a candidate who has become a lightning rod for rightwing anger nationally.</p> <p>\u201cAnything that indicates AOC is vulnerable would be godsend to people who don\u2019t like her or are upset about the Amazon loss of 27,000 jobs in New York,\u201d said veteran Democratic party strategist Hank Sheinkopf, warning: \u201cPolitics are unstable across the nation. Things are happening that we haven\u2019t seen or thought about before.\u201d</p> <p>Strategically speaking, a challenge to one of the most influential voices on the American left also could affect candidates in other, more marginal races. Within New York City, more than three dozen candidates promoting progressive, generational change are taking on congressional incumbents.</p> <p>In her own district, enthusiasm among supporters for Ocasio-Cortez is unwavering. The Working Families party \u201cknows Ocasio-Cortez will beat any challengers who might arise because she\u2019s fighting tirelessly for her district and her agenda speaks to the people of Queens and the Bronx\u201d, the group said in a statement to the Guardian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cf5c58f6c305bd9e822af3fb8646380fb9511eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cf5c58f6c305bd9e822af3fb8646380fb9511eb/0_81_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez serves drinks in support of One Fair Wage at the Queensboro restaurant in Queens, New York, on 31 May 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez serves drinks in support of One Fair Wage at the Queensboro restaurant in Queens, New York, on 31 May 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the Ocasio-Cortez campaign also knows that opposition to her remains deep within the Democratic party establishment. Open warfare broke out in July when the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, took aim at her and her close colleagues in the Squad. </p> <p>\u201cAll these people have is their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1147668951834476545\">tweeted response</a>, Ocasio-Cortez said: \u201cThat public \u2018whatever\u2019 is called public sentiment. And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country.\u201d</p> <p>The progressive-moderate split could be clearly discerned, too, in the battle last year over the election of a new Queens district attorney when Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, an Ocasio-Cortez-backed candidate running on a platform to reduce record levels of incarceration, initially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/26/tiffany-caban-election-vote-victory-declared-democrat-da-queens\">declared victory</a> with a margin of 1,100 votes.</p> <p>But establishment-backed candidate Melinda Katz demanded a recount and ultimately pulled ahead by 55 votes after a series of court challenges over voter eligibility.</p> <p>Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s most coherent Democratic challenger to date is former longtime CNBC correspondent and anchor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera. Caruso-Cabrera, who published a book in 2011 called You Know I\u2019m Right: More Prosperity, Less Government, is a skeptic of big government and a proponent of free markets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"360db8b66e3f86f52ac40684ca76977c89bcf063\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/360db8b66e3f86f52ac40684ca76977c89bcf063/0_96_2261_2826/800.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Caruso-Cabrera in May 2011.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Caruso-Cabrera in May 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Agostini/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Caruso-Cabrera is a relatively recent Democratic party member who registered her candidacy last week, appear to be preparing a more serious challenge as she seeks to take on Ocasio-Cortez in the Democratic primary.</p> <p>\u201cCaruso-Cabrero is as wild a card as AOC was two years ago,\u201d said Sheinkopf. \u201cCaruso-Cabrero is likely to lead a spirited challenge and could be very competitive.\u201d</p> <p>She certainly fancies her chances.</p> <p>\u201cI am the daughter and granddaughter of working-class Italian and Cuban immigrants,\u201d Caruso-Cabrera said in a statement. \u201cI am so lucky to have had such a wonderful career and I want everybody to have the opportunity that I\u2019ve had. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running.\u201d</p> <p>Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign declined to comment on the challenge. But people close to the campaign said Caruso-Cabrera could be AOC\u2019s most potent opponent at least from the Democratic side, even though she represents a radically different vision of the party.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting if she decides to hide her libertarian-conservative ideology,\u201d one source said. \u201cCertain conservatives are upset that AOC beat Crowley and over Amazon so there maybe certain Koch-type figures who have had some role in recruiting her. I don\u2019t think [Caruso-Cabrera] is going to get young Democrats from around the country to work for her, but you could see young conservative activists in the district because they all spend so much time condemning her politics or lusting after her.\u201d</p> <p>However, candidates on both sides will be looking to raise money from outside the relatively poor, racially diverse district. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s fame has long transcended the borders of her hardscrabble patch of the Bronx.</p> <p>\u201cAOC can raise an awful lot of money throughout the country from all sorts of people, but within the district there\u2019s not an awful lot of money to raise,\u201d said Sheinkopf.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Democratic leftist superstar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has risen to national \u2013 and even global \u2013 fame from an unlikely position as a young first-time congresswoman from New York. But now she faces 13 different challengers, including from within her own party as well as Republicans, as she prepares for her first congressional re-election campaign. News of the multiple bids to unseat AOC, however, came as a surprise to many voters on the streets of her district in the Bronx last week. Some voters still had not heard of the progressive superstar. Others said they would weigh the merits of her rivals as the contests heat up over the summer. But most voiced support, arguing that almost two years since Ocasio-Cortez threw a grenade at the Democratic establishment by ousting incumbent Joe Crowley, her progressive agenda \u2013 touting universal healthcare and a Green New Deal \u2013 was only now taking hold in the nation\u2019s political capital. \u201cGive her a chance! We knew who she was when we sent her, that she\u2019d make a noise, and making a noise was why we sent her,\u201d said local businessman Abdul Abbas. \u201cShe\u2019s done good things for the Bronx,\u201d concurred Carol Heraldo. \u201cI like how she presents herself as woman, that she\u2019s firm, that she took what she believed and made it real. We don\u2019t see a lot of young people accomplish a lot because they\u2019re afraid \u2013 and she\u2019s not afraid.\u201d That\u2019s not how all see it. The first-term congresswoman is facing eight Republican and five Democratic candidates aiming to unseat her. Some appear symbolic, with little fundraising potential or appetite for collecting the necessary 4,000 signatures to get on the ballot. At her first campaign rally on Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez said she hoped to multiply turnout by four, reaching 60,000 votes in the primary election. She declined to be drawn on the challengers that have lined up to contest her seat. \u201cI think everyone has a right [to run]. I of course won my seat with a primary,\u201d she told the New York Post. \u201cI would never begrudge anyone trying to run in a primary.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Republican challengers certainly seem to have their work cut out for them. In 2018 she steamedrolled the Republican candidate by a margin of 78%. With about $3.4m in her campaigns re-election coffers in a solidly Democratic district, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Republican challengers probably plan on merely damaging her or securing a bigger national media profile by taking on such a famed opponent. John Cummings, a former police officer, raised $425,000 in 10 weeks after announcing his candidacy for the Republican nomination on Fox &amp; Friends. Jamaican immigrant Scherie Murray gave her first interview to Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity and raised a similar amount. But having led a campaign to prevent Amazon from establishing a headquarters in neighboring Long Island City, and established herself as a leading member of \u201cthe Squad\u201d, the self-described group of progressive congresswomen that includes Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ocasio-Cortez is a political target. In a district that hasn\u2019t voted Republican in half a century, the Republican candidates are tackling a candidate who has become a lightning rod for rightwing anger nationally. \u201cAnything that indicates AOC is vulnerable would be godsend to people who don\u2019t like her or are upset about the Amazon loss of 27,000 jobs in New York,\u201d said veteran Democratic party strategist Hank Sheinkopf, warning: \u201cPolitics are unstable across the nation. Things are happening that we haven\u2019t seen or thought about before.\u201d Strategically speaking, a challenge to one of the most influential voices on the American left also could affect candidates in other, more marginal races. Within New York City, more than three dozen candidates promoting progressive, generational change are taking on congressional incumbents. In her own district, enthusiasm among supporters for Ocasio-Cortez is unwavering. The Working Families party \u201cknows Ocasio-Cortez will beat any challengers who might arise because she\u2019s fighting tirelessly for her district and her agenda speaks to the people of Queens and the Bronx\u201d, the group said in a statement to the Guardian. But the Ocasio-Cortez campaign also knows that opposition to her remains deep within the Democratic party establishment. Open warfare broke out in July when the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, took aim at her and her close colleagues in the Squad. \u201cAll these people have is their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d In a tweeted response, Ocasio-Cortez said: \u201cThat public \u2018whatever\u2019 is called public sentiment. And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country.\u201d The progressive-moderate split could be clearly discerned, too, in the battle last year over the election of a new Queens district attorney when Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, an Ocasio-Cortez-backed candidate running on a platform to reduce record levels of incarceration, initially declared victory with a margin of 1,100 votes. But establishment-backed candidate Melinda Katz demanded a recount and ultimately pulled ahead by 55 votes after a series of court challenges over voter eligibility. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s most coherent Democratic challenger to date is former longtime CNBC correspondent and anchor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera. Caruso-Cabrera, who published a book in 2011 called You Know I\u2019m Right: More Prosperity, Less Government, is a skeptic of big government and a proponent of free markets. Caruso-Cabrera is a relatively recent Democratic party member who registered her candidacy last week, appear to be preparing a more serious challenge as she seeks to take on Ocasio-Cortez in the Democratic primary. \u201cCaruso-Cabrero is as wild a card as AOC was two years ago,\u201d said Sheinkopf. \u201cCaruso-Cabrero is likely to lead a spirited challenge and could be very competitive.\u201d She certainly fancies her chances. \u201cI am the daughter and granddaughter of working-class Italian and Cuban immigrants,\u201d Caruso-Cabrera said in a statement. \u201cI am so lucky to have had such a wonderful career and I want everybody to have the opportunity that I\u2019ve had. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign declined to comment on the challenge. But people close to the campaign said Caruso-Cabrera could be AOC\u2019s most potent opponent at least from the Democratic side, even though she represents a radically different vision of the party. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting if she decides to hide her libertarian-conservative ideology,\u201d one source said. \u201cCertain conservatives are upset that AOC beat Crowley and over Amazon so there maybe certain Koch-type figures who have had some role in recruiting her. I don\u2019t think [Caruso-Cabrera] is going to get young Democrats from around the country to work for her, but you could see young conservative activists in the district because they all spend so much time condemning her politics or lusting after her.\u201d However, candidates on both sides will be looking to raise money from outside the relatively poor, racially diverse district. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s fame has long transcended the borders of her hardscrabble patch of the Bronx. \u201cAOC can raise an awful lot of money throughout the country from all sorts of people, but within the district there\u2019s not an awful lot of money to raise,\u201d said Sheinkopf.",

      "bodyText": "Laura Ashley has confirmed that its Malaysian owner is locked in make-or-break talks with its bank over access to emergency funding as the fashion and furniture retailer revealed a steep drop in sales amid \u201cchallenging\u201d conditions for the sector. The company, which is listed in the UK, said it would have to \u201cconsider all appropriate options\u201d if it could not get hold of more cash, raising fears for the jobs of more than 2,700 workers. MUI Asia, which is controlled by the multimillionaire shareholder Khoo Kay Peng, and Wells Fargo are trying to reach an agreement over Laura Ashley\u2019s funding requirements in the short to medium term. Sales slumped by 10.8% year on year in the second half of 2019. The company blamed \u201cmarket headwinds and weaker consumer spending\u201d, which it said had dampened demand for larger, more expensive items. Sales were flat for the first seven weeks of trading this year. The pressures on the retailer, which plans to close more of its 155 UK stores, have been exacerbated by a fall in stock levels after Christmas. This has reduced its ability to offer assets in exchange for secured loans. The company was started in 1953 by Laura Ashely and her husband, Bernard, with fabrics printed on their kitchen table. The company became a stalwart of the British high street and Princess Diana was a famous fan of its floral fabrics. MUI became a shareholder in 1998, adding Laura Ashley to an empire that also includes hotels, food and financial services interests. Khoo was succeeded by his son Andrew Khoo as Laura Ashley\u2019s chairman in 2018. The retailer has since endured a difficult time, with low consumer confidence and a weak housing market. It lost \u00a314.3m in the year to 30 June 2019. Andrew Khoo said: \u201cWe acknowledge that recent trading conditions, in line with the overall UK retail market, have indeed been challenging. There is, however, a robust plan in place to turn the business around and the board of directors is confident and optimistic that the recent appointment of Katharine Poulter [the incoming chief executive] will enable the business to execute this broad-based strategy. \u201cThe major shareholders have indicated their continued confidence in the business and are fully supportive of the management team and execution of the transformation plan.\u201d Laura Ashley\u2019s statement said the talks with its lender did not include a cash injection into the group, contrary to some reports. The retailer was \u201cwell advanced in developing its turnaround strategy\u201d, it said, but added that it was only at an early stage of carrying it out. Shares in the company, which is to report its first-half results on Thursday, slumped 38% to 2.24p. In a further sign of stress on the high street, the low cost footwear retailer Shoe Zone warned it could be forced to close 100 stores \u2013 one in five of its UK chain \u2013 unless business rates are reduced.

      "body": "<h2>In defence of Arteta</h2> <p>It says a lot about the reign of Unai Emery that, until Sunday, it had been almost 11 months since Arsenal kept successive clean sheets in the league. Burnley and Newcastle are not the sternest tests of a side\u2019s defence \u2013 and Arsenal rode their luck in both instances \u2013 but there is no doubt David Luiz and co have begun to look notably more assured. Fourteen years after the departure of the club\u2019s last top-class centre-back in Sol Campbell, could this be the beginnings of a new, level-headed Arsenal backline? Mikel Arteta\u2019s first 11 games in charge have seen his side concede eight goals; the equivalent figure from Emery\u2019s final 11 games was 23. Goals at the other end have declined, too, by about a third, but that\u2019s a small price to pay if it lessens the embarrassing clownishness at the back. Arteta was recruited because of his affiliation with thrilling possession football. His best work so far has been to revive the old spirit of \u201cboring, boring Arsenal\u201d. <strong>Alex Hess</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/16/arsenal-turn-on-the-style-in-second-half-to-thrash-newcastle\" title=\"\">Arsenal 4-0 Newcastle</a></em></p> <h2>Villa get it right at one end</h2> <p>On a day when Son Heung-min scored his 50th Premier League goal, Aston Villa recorded an unwanted half-century of their own. \u201cIt is a lot,\u201d said Dean Smith, whose side have the worst defensive record in the division after conceding 50. They are actually on course to score 50, the sort of total that should inoculate a side against relegation but their fate may rest on whether enterprising attacking or porous defending proves the greater factor. There are times, though, when Villa feel luckless. Bjorn Engels, who played an unfortunate role in two goals, was only playing because Tyrone Mings was struck down with tonsillitis. Arguably their best win of the campaign, at Burnley, was marred by season\u2011ending injuries to Tom Heaton and Wesley. John McGinn, brilliant against Tottenham in August, has not played since Christmas. It is just as well Jack Grealish looks to be indestructible. <strong>Richard Jolly</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/16/aston-villa-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Aston Villa 2-3 Tottenham</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Norwich can come back stronger</h2> <p>Norwich are getting better.

Expectation management is at work but relegation will not bring an end to the Norwich project and Farke, should he stay on next term, will know his young team are stronger than they were when last in the Championship. Norwich have become more competitive the longer the season has gone on. They still play their football but the gaps in defence are narrower and there are fewer careless actions.

Dennis Praet and Youri Tielemans did not look a natural midfield pairing in the Carabao Cup semi-final against Aston Villa, so Ryan Bennett or Wes Morgan could join Caglar Soyuncu and Jonny Evans as Leicester seek to rub salt into City\u2019s wounds. Choudhury has been an energetic force for Leicester behind James Maddison and Tielemans but his rashness remains a trait he needs to eradicate, even if his first yellow card at Molineux for a foul on Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez was harsh. <strong>Peter Lansley</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/14/wolves-leicester-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Wolves 0-0 Leicester</a></em></p> <h2>QPR bring excitement to Championship</h2> <p>If it\u2019s drama you want, then there\u2019s no shortage at either end of the Championship, with both the title race and the relegation scrap providing plenty of seat-of-the-pants excitement. But if it\u2019s fun you want, look no further than the team in 16th, QPR, who are surely English football\u2019s most gloriously maddening team to support right now. Only two teams in the division have scored more and only one team has conceded more than the west Londoners, who were in typically rollercoaster form at home to Stoke, going 2-0 down within half an hour before roaring back to win 4-2. As has become customary this season, a defence resembling Swiss cheese was bailed out of trouble by the twinkle-toed magic of the men on their flanks: Eberechi Eze and Bright Osayi-Samuel, natural born entertainers who make playing football look like an effortless pleasure. Both were on the scoresheet, the latter seeming to defy the rules of physics to lash the ball home from an absurd angle, and both players\u2019 agents can expect to field plenty of calls this summer. QPR are unlikely to go up, so the temptation for the players to listen to offers will be strong.

But sometimes it really got on my nerves. The same piece, over and over again! I was a teenager, an impatient lad who wanted to master the highlights of the repertoire as soon as possible. I felt driven to explore the world from the piano bench. But no matter what I prepared, my teacher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Heinz_K%C3%A4mmerling\">Karl-Heinz K\u00e4mmerling</a> always came back to Beethoven\u2019s Op 2, No 2. At some point, often mid-lesson, he would stride to the bookcase in his studio and fetch his old <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2018/03/21/595626141/the-pianist-who-first-climbed-beethovens-mount-everest\">Artur Schnabel</a> edition. Covered with pencilled inscriptions, the ragged volume bore the marks of 50 years of intense scrutiny. \u201cI just thought of something else,\u201d he used to say. K\u00e4mmerling, the legendary professor at Hanover Musikhochschule, would then put his finger on some passage in the sonata. The point was always something microscopic \u2013 a tempo relation, a minimum<em> ritardando</em>, the dynamic shading of the parts, sonority, pedalling.

Our teacher worked with us obsessively in the spirit of Eugen Herrigel\u2019s Zen in the Art of Archery. It was a book he often came to talk about: a clearly defined assignment as training in humility, a constant mirror of inner growth, yet somehow invariably the nucleus of the entire universe.</p> <p>My assignment was an especially airy, witty, mercurial affair.

Every nuance of articulation has to be just right, otherwise the wry humour will fall flat. And then, as an antithesis, there\u2019s the wonderful <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/4IqUN1Lxp55USRr7F3qJ8h\">Largo Appassionato</a>, one of the most deeply felt slow movements in early Beethoven. This sonata truly covers all the bases: vivid colours, scuttling energy, dialogues that make the musical shapes congeal in empathy, only to clash in confrontation.

Physically, spiritually, even in my disposition. This was music I could identify with: that\u2019s me, that\u2019s my personality. Lightning fast in thought and action. As many impressions as possible, maximum concision of event. Yet I also felt the desire to immerse myself, to be entirely alone, to feel the long arc. Those immense slow movements, like the harrowing <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/45XXUmuq7fXN8tuifbD4Vg\">Largo e Mesto</a> from the early D major sonata, Op 10, No 3, or the <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/77x1tFk9Ac7KDJugAEKZQu\">Adagio</a> of the Hammerklavier. Even today they remain recesses where I can escape the restlessness of our times. In a strange way I\u2019ve always felt secure with Beethoven, especially when he takes time and retreats from the turbulent development of the conflict-ridden movements. But I love the opposite extreme just as much. The opening of the <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/3WFTQHUd4DBoEucAWxaPDm\">Waldstein</a><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/3WFTQHUd4DBoEucAWxaPDm\"> sonata</a>, for instance. It starts out with a pulse of 180. The opening is beyond belief: pure energy, pure tension, keenest anticipation. Joy, happiness, curiosity, love. There\u2019s almost nowhere to breathe in this movement, and you have to stay on top of it at every instant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Beethoven is uncomplicated in the most complex way</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In purely pianistic terms, Beethoven\u2019s writing is fairly straightforward.

On the contrary, the hand is a relatively self-contained unit, guiding the parts with stable bearing while giving each part its expressive weight. Then this direct, straight, rapid attack. Very collected, very taut. We know how the young Beethoven impressed his contemporaries with the power and speed of his playing, all the while tirelessly polishing his technique. He constantly jotted down thorny finger exercises between compositional sketches. The physics of his piano writing stems, of course, from the inner essence of his music.

An issue of Woman\u2019s Day published in May last year said on its cover: \u201cPalace confirms the marriage is over! Why Harry was left with no choice but to end it\u201d. The Australian Press Council has ruled that Woman\u2019s Day, which is a member of the self-regulatory body, was in breach of standards for accuracy for the headline, which was not backed up by the article. Even allowing for the latitude given for factual exaggeration and inaccuracies in publications of this kind, the magazine had crossed a line, the council said. The magazine, published by Bauer Media, had to publish the adjudication in print and online on Monday. \u201cWhile an entertainment publication can be expected to use some exaggeration, the headline was expressed as an unqualified fact that the palace had confirmed the marriage was over,\u201d the council said. \u201cThe council considers that the statement in the headline was such that it was more than just an exaggeration, and that it was misleading. \u201cThe council acknowledges that celebrity and gossip magazines are purchased for light entertainment, with readers not necessarily assuming that everything presented is factual.\u201d The publisher told the press council that neither the royal family nor the couple had complained about the article so it had not been corrected. On 8 January Harry and Meghan announced that they planned to step back from senior roles in the royal family, in part because of their unhappiness about living life in the public spotlight. They have launched several defamation actions against the British press. The Woman\u2019s Day article used several anonymous sources and alleged the duchess had an \u201conline relationship\u201d with the British singer Matt Cardle. Meghan, who has consistently attracted negative press, was accused of being \u201cabsent from royal duties\u201d. \u201c\u2018Until now Harry has been giving Meghan the benefit of the doubt\u2019, says our source,\u201d the article said. \u201c\u2018But he\u2019s only willing to take so much and it\u2019s reached the stage where enough is truly enough.\u2019\u201d Woman\u2019s Day argued that magazines trading in gossip and celebrity had readers who understood it was \u201clight entertainment\u201d and it would be \u201cunreasonable to hold such publications to a standard similar to that of other news media\u201d. \u201cReaders should expect a level of exaggeration and a complaint could be made about almost every gossip magazine,\u201d it said.",

One passenger from Sydney said she was \u201cfeeling so exhausted it\u2019s kind of just a relief\u201d.

Another group of 35 who arrived on Christmas Island later after being evacuated on an Air New Zealand flight that travelled via Auckland must remain to finish their 14 days in quarantine later this week. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, acknowledged that the people on board the cruise ship had already been in quarantine for 12 days and had \u201cdone everything that they have been asked to do\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert has long been the hoary cliche of new starts, the story of a woman who apparently can\u2019t find any decent Italian food in New York, but for my money it is not a patch on the best of that genre, Julia Child\u2019s My Life in France, the memoir of how she wrote Mastering the Art of French Cooking. It is great on food, but even better on life, and accepting it just as it is. She finds joy everywhere, and it\u2019s extremely hard not to fall in love with her. If the weather is not behaving itself and you want to heat up a little, How Stella Got Her Groove Back by Terry McMillan is the sexy, sun-drenched story of a woman finding herself in the Caribbean with a handsome younger man, full of laughs and heart. You will also unfailingly be cheered by Elizabeth von Arnim\u2019s absolutely gorgeous 1922 novel The Enchanted April, about a mismatched set of women spending a month together in Tuscany; it\u2019s pure escapist heaven. The best series about changing yourself and finding where you belong remains of course Armistead Maupin\u2019s Tales of the City. Mouse and Michael and the rest\u2019s lives take many twists and turns but their courage to follow their own paths, whatever the cost, remains bittersweet, uplifting, and a stunning story of its time. Triumphing over your background like spring triumphs over winter is always fertile territory for memoir. Perhaps the most exciting recently is Tara Westover\u2019s Educated; she had a home life that is frankly astonishing, and how she ends up doing a master\u2019s at Cambridge will make your heart soar. If you are in the mood for a rather gentler story of a woman getting her education, Daddy Long Legs by Jean Webster is as tender and funny as ever. An avalanche of similar novels followed the phenomenon of Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman (it has sold 1.8m copies); the best of them is probably Needlemouse by Jane O\u2019Connor, about an utter horror of a secretary who slowly and painfully gets nicer. For more general cheer, turn off the news and leaf through Steven Pinker\u2019s Enlightenment Now and The Better Angels of Our Nature, both books about how despite it all, things are genuinely getting better for almost everyone, with lots of serious-looking graphs to prove it. They may not be panaceas, but they are useful correctives to the doom narratives de nos jours.

      "body": "<p>The PX7 are the latest flagship noise-cancelling headphones from upmarket British manufacturer Bowers &amp; Wilkins, which excel on sound while giving Bose a real run for its money.</p> <p>B&amp;W have long made excellent headphones. Its first noise-cancelling headphones looked and sounded great, but weren\u2019t comfortable. The \u00a3350 PX7\u2019s redesigned earcups fix that problem while offering Bose-rivalling noise cancelling and exquisite sound.</p> <h2>Distinctive design</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2e21ed29148a19a59505a646101998960a03738\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2e21ed29148a19a59505a646101998960a03738/518_298_3921_2354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bowers & Wilkins PX7 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The curved arm and metallic oval with Bowers &amp; Wilkins logo stand out in a crowd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>B&amp;W\u2019s headphone design stands out compared to most others with the company\u2019s distinctive mix of single-arm earcup mounts, fabric covers and large brushed-metal trims.</p> <p>The PX7 are large, over-ear headphones but they manage their 310g weight and bulk well, not feeling too heavy or cumbersome on the head. The earcups are big, with plush cushions that sit firmly but comfortably on the side of your head. The headband is lined with the same soft leatherette as the earcups and sits comfortably on your dome and doesn\u2019t slip around on your hair.</p> <p>The headband is long and protrudes with the arms wider than the ear cups, making the headphones look big on your head. Wearing them is therefore a bit of a statement compared with something more subtle such as the Bose QC35 II.</p> <p>The earcups rotate to flat for storage, but not into a more compact alignment with the cups together, which makes them fairly large to put into a bag.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 310g</p></li> <li><p><strong>Drivers:</strong> 43.6mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth 5.0, USB-C charging and audio, 3.5mm headphones socket</p></li> <li><p><strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> SBC, AAC, aptX, aptX HD, aptX Adaptive</p></li> <li><p><strong>Battery life:</strong> 30 hours</p></li> </ul> <h2>Controls and connectivity</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d31b04347705c58890ad2e113de98efd507594b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d31b04347705c58890ad2e113de98efd507594b0/290_129_4604_2764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bowers & Wilkins PX7 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The playback controls, USB-C and headphones ports are on the right earcup leaving just the noise-cancelling button on the left.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The left earcup has a multi-function button that controls noise cancelling. Press it to cycle between automatic, low, high and noise cancelling off. Press and hold it to activate an excellent, customisable ambient mode for listening out for announcements.</p> <p>The right earcup has a USB-C charging port, a 3.5mm analogue socket, three buttons for controlling playback, track skip and volume, plus a sliding switch for turning the headphones on or off and activating pairing.</p> <p>The buttons are excellent, with a clear metallic-sounding click when you\u2019ve successfully activated them. The earcups also have presence sensors.

The USB-C socket can also be used for audio with any computer, tablet or smartphone that supports USB-C audio output.</p> <p>Bluetooth 5.0 caters for those that want to go wireless. They support the standard SBC and AAC audio codecs, plus Qualcomm\u2019s latest <a href=\"https://www.aptx.com/aptx-adaptive\">aptX Adaptive Audio</a> codecs, which is designed to solve lipsync and interference issues, while providing significantly higher quality audio. They are some of the first headphones to support the new standard, which is also backwards compatible with the older aptX and aptX HD available on practically every modern Android smartphone and Windows computer. Apple\u2019s various devices are limited to AAC as their highest quality standard.</p> <p>The PX7s can connect to two Bluetooth devices at once, which is handy for watching video on your computer or tablet while still being connected to your phone for calls.

The low is only suitable for listening in a quiet space, or if you want some awareness of your surroundings. I ended up leaving them on maximum.</p> <p>One area of weakness is in dealing with wind noise, which comes through the headphones loudly.

      "bodyText": "The PX7 are the latest flagship noise-cancelling headphones from upmarket British manufacturer Bowers &amp; Wilkins, which excel on sound while giving Bose a real run for its money. B&amp;W have long made excellent headphones. Its first noise-cancelling headphones looked and sounded great, but weren\u2019t comfortable. The \u00a3350 PX7\u2019s redesigned earcups fix that problem while offering Bose-rivalling noise cancelling and exquisite sound. Distinctive design B&amp;W\u2019s headphone design stands out compared to most others with the company\u2019s distinctive mix of single-arm earcup mounts, fabric covers and large brushed-metal trims. The PX7 are large, over-ear headphones but they manage their 310g weight and bulk well, not feeling too heavy or cumbersome on the head. The earcups are big, with plush cushions that sit firmly but comfortably on the side of your head. The headband is lined with the same soft leatherette as the earcups and sits comfortably on your dome and doesn\u2019t slip around on your hair. The headband is long and protrudes with the arms wider than the ear cups, making the headphones look big on your head. Wearing them is therefore a bit of a statement compared with something more subtle such as the Bose QC35 II. The earcups rotate to flat for storage, but not into a more compact alignment with the cups together, which makes them fairly large to put into a bag. Specifications Weight: 310g Drivers: 43.6mm Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0, USB-C charging and audio, 3.5mm headphones socket Bluetooth codecs: SBC, AAC, aptX, aptX HD, aptX Adaptive Battery life: 30 hours Controls and connectivity The left earcup has a multi-function button that controls noise cancelling. Press it to cycle between automatic, low, high and noise cancelling off. Press and hold it to activate an excellent, customisable ambient mode for listening out for announcements. The right earcup has a USB-C charging port, a 3.5mm analogue socket, three buttons for controlling playback, track skip and volume, plus a sliding switch for turning the headphones on or off and activating pairing. The buttons are excellent, with a clear metallic-sounding click when you\u2019ve successfully activated them. The earcups also have presence sensors. Lift one or take off the headphones and the music pauses and resumes when they\u2019re replaced. The PX7s are some of the most connected and future-proofed headphones money can buy \u2013 however you want to connect your device, these headphones will handle it. For those that prefer the cabled approach, the standard 3.5mm audio socket is there, although you have to have the headphones powered on for it to work. The USB-C socket can also be used for audio with any computer, tablet or smartphone that supports USB-C audio output. Bluetooth 5.0 caters for those that want to go wireless. They support the standard SBC and AAC audio codecs, plus Qualcomm\u2019s latest aptX Adaptive Audio codecs, which is designed to solve lipsync and interference issues, while providing significantly higher quality audio. They are some of the first headphones to support the new standard, which is also backwards compatible with the older aptX and aptX HD available on practically every modern Android smartphone and Windows computer. Apple\u2019s various devices are limited to AAC as their highest quality standard. The PX7s can connect to two Bluetooth devices at once, which is handy for watching video on your computer or tablet while still being connected to your phone for calls. Connectivity to an iPhone 11 Pro, a OnePlus 7 Pro 5G or a Microsoft Surface Pro 6 was rock solid while no lipsync issues were visible on any video apps on an iPhone or Android device. Active noise cancelling Bose has long been king of active noise-cancelling technology, which uses microphones to detect unwanted sound and cancels it out with the inverse sound waves projected from the headphone\u2019s speakers. The PX7 rival Bose in being able to all but eliminate the roar of the road or engine, do a very good job of reducing voice and other distractions common in the office or commute, and do so without affecting the the sound quality. They also have a low and automatic mode. The low is only suitable for listening in a quiet space, or if you want some awareness of your surroundings. I ended up leaving them on maximum. One area of weakness is in dealing with wind noise, which comes through the headphones loudly. Turning off the noise cancelling helped, but Bose\u2019s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are unrivalled here. Sound Simply put, the PX7 sound fantastic; they are the sort of multi-talented headphones that have you discovering new elements in well-worn tracks. Feed them some high-energy electronica and you\u2019re treated to punchy, well controlled bass, energetic mids and sparkling highs. They sound suitably raw for a full-blooded rendition of Nirvana\u2019s Smells Like Teen Spirit, while you\u2019ll practically be able to hear fingers on strings during Hotel California from the Eagles\u2019 remastered Hell Freezes Over. They\u2019re just as at home playing something like Jupiter from Holst\u2019s the Planets suite or Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s classic Summertime too. My only criticism is that to get the best out of them you have to give them a little bit of volume, but anything above one-third on your phone\u2019s volume scale and you\u2019re rocking. Call quality was good, with the other end of the line clearly able to hear me even with background noise, which did leak in more than Bose or Sennheiser rivals but was managable. Battery life The PX7s last for about 30 hours of wireless playback with noise cancelling active, which is long enough for about three weeks of commuting or more than enough for even the longest of flights. A 15-minute charge also provides up to around five hours of playback, should they need topping up, with a full charge taking around three hours. The battery is rated for a minimum of 500 full charge cycles, after which capacity is likely to be reduced to 80%, but should still work fine. The battery can be replaced B&amp;W under service. The earpads are user replaceable, costing \u00a322 for a pair, while the headphones are generally repairable rather than disposable. The PX7s do not contain any recycled material, but B&amp;W does accept old units for recycling. Observations There is an occasional audible creak from the headphones\u2019 frame when wearing them USB-C audio works with Android smartphones, but not via a USB-C to Lightning cable with an iPhone Price The Bowers &amp; Wilkins PX7 are available in dark grey or silver costing \u00a3349.99. For comparison, the RRP for the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 is \u00a3349.95, QuietComfort 35 II is \u00a3300 (currently \u00a3280), Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM3 cost \u00a3329, Beats Studio 3 Wireless cost \u00a3300, with cheaper models such as Lindy\u2019s BNX-60 starting around \u00a390. Verdict The new Bowers &amp; Wilkins PX7 are a fantastic set of big, expensive headphones that are worth every penny. Very few headphones manage to combine truly effective noise cancellation with exquisite sound, but that\u2019s what we have here. The PX7 are some of the best-sounding headphones I\u2019ve had the pleasure to listen to in a long time. They\u2019re also comfortable, stay put on your head, last a long time between charges and are future-proofed thanks to support for the very latest Bluetooth standards, codecs and both USB-C audio and a traditional 3.5mm analogue headphones cable.

But if you\u2019re looking for a set of high-end wireless noise-cancelling headphones that also sound like they\u2019re worth the premium you pay for them, the B&amp;W PX7 should be at the top of your list. Pros: fantastic sound, effective noise cancelling, long battery life, USB-C charging and audio, 3.5mm headphones, Bluetooth 5.0, atpX Adaptive, comfortable, stable Cons: big, expensive, can\u2019t be used via cable without power, only fold flat, struggle with wind noise Other reviews Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 review: less business, more modern design Microsoft Surface Headphones review: close but no cigar Five of the best noise-cancelling headphones Marshall Major III Bluetooth review: rocking wireless headphones Sony WF-1000XM3 review: updated noise-cancelling earbuds sound great AirPods Pro review: a touch of Apple magic",

      "body": "<p>Andrew Marantz is a staff writer for the <em>New Yorker</em>, and a pretty good one. He\u2019s written a lot of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/andrew-marantz\" title=\"\">perceptive stuff</a> about the tech industry in recent years. One morning in 2016, he was in his office exploring \u201ca particularly foul part of social media undergrowth\u201d, when the magazine\u2019s editor, David Remnick, came in, looked at the screen and asked: \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Marantz told him to sit down and watch.</p> <p>He repeated some of the Facebook searches he\u2019d been doing, bringing up toxic memes and propaganda posts and reading out the \u201cengagement\u201d statistics below each one: 5,000 shares here, 15,000 \u201cLikes\u201d there. Then he pulled up the <em>New Yorker</em>\u2019s Facebook page. A recent landmark piece got just 87 shares; Remnick\u2019s own piece about Aretha Franklin had even fewer \u2013 78 shares. And so on. \u201cI get it,\u201d said the editor. \u201cIt\u2019s not auspicious, but where\u2019s the story in it?\u201d Marantz pressed on, exploring the maze of pro-Trump propaganda and viral memes. \u201cWhat if I could find the people who are peddling this stuff?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat could be a story,\u201d Remnick replied.</p> <p>He was right, and this book tells that tale. To research it, Marantz frequented some of the nastiest circles of the American \u201calt-right\u201d, got to know some of the home-grown virtuosos of disinformation and disruption, embedded himself in a startup that specialises in exploiting online \u201cvirality\u201d, and reflected on the recent history of social media and its monetisation and amplification of hate, white supremacism and disinformation. His conclusions are not reassuring for anyone who regards a functioning public sphere and accountable media power as prerequisites for democracy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dba19a7732334aaac86a2622d8f3450005533192\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dba19a7732334aaac86a2622d8f3450005533192/0_0_3032_2008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Atwater, \u2018the Paganini of the modern political dog-whistle\u2019, with George Bush in 1986\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Atwater, \u2018the Paganini of the modern political dog-whistle\u2019, with George Bush in 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cynthia Johnson/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Early in the book, Marantz observes that \u201cTrump seemed to draw on pools of dark energy not previously observed within the universe of the American electorate\u201d. This supposed invisibility rather depends on historical amnesia. The white supremacism that manifested itself in 2016 has a long history, and not just in the deep south. Marantz himself traces its antecedents back to Lee Atwater \u2013 \u201cthe Paganini of the modern political dog-whistle\u201d \u2013 who worked for the sainted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ronald-reagan\" title=\"\">Ronald Reagan</a> and was deputy director of his re-election campaign. Atwater popularised the \u201csouthern strategy\u201d of coded racism aimed at white voters in the deep south that turned many of them from Democrats to Republicans. (He later joined the lobbying firm co-founded by Paul Manafort and Roger Stone, names that have become familiar again since 2016.) Reagan\u2019s communications director was Pat Buchanan, who developed \u201cAmerica first\u201d from a blueprint established by Charles Lindbergh and his fellow Nazi admirers in the 1940s. And Reagan\u2019s campaign motto? \u201cLet\u2019s make America great again.\u201d</p> <p>There has always been a dark undercurrent of white supremacism in some sectors of American culture. It was kept from public view for decades by the editorial gatekeepers of the old media ecosystem. But once the internet arrived, a sophisticated online culture of conspiracy theorists, racists and other malign discontents thrived in cyberspace. But it stayed below the radar until a fully paid-up conspiracy theorist won the Republican nomination. Trump\u2019s candidacy and campaign had the effect of \u201cmainstreaming\u201d that which had previously been largely hidden from view. At which point, the innocent public began to see and experience what Marantz has closely observed, namely the remarkable capabilities of extremist \u201cedgelords\u201d to weaponise YouTube, Twitter and Facebook for destructive purposes.</p> <p>One of the most depressing things about 2016 was the apparent inability of American journalism to deal with this pollution of the public sphere. In part, this was because they were crippled by their professional standards. It\u2019s not always possible to be even-handed and honest. \u201cThe plain fact,\u201d writes Marantz at one point, \u201cwas that the alt-right was a racist movement full of creeps and liars. If a newspaper\u2019s house style didn\u2019t allow its reporters to say so, then the house style was preventing its reporters from telling the truth.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/19/the-networker-donald-trump-tweets-twitter-good-for-business\" title=\"\">Trump\u2019s mastery of Twitter</a> led the news agenda every day, faithfully followed by mainstream media, like beagles following a live trail. And his use of the \u201cfake news\u201d metaphor was masterly: a reminder of why, as Marantz points out, <em>L\u00fcgenpresse</em> \u2013 \u201clying press\u201d \u2013 was also a favourite epithet of Joseph Goebbels.</p> <p>At the end of this absorbing and disturbing book, we are left with two awkward questions. One is whether digital technology \u2013 as controlled and deployed by a small number of unregulated tech corporations that derive their profits from monetising \u201cuser engagement\u201d (a polite term for prioritising dis- and misinformation, lies, outrage and nonsense) \u2013 now constitutes an existential threat to liberal democracy. And if the answer to that is yes, are we going to do anything about it before it\u2019s too late? Second, was the old media ecosystem, with its elitist gatekeepers, editorial control, political bias and other flaws, really worse than what we have acquired? Or, pace Winston Churchill on democracy, was it just the worst system apart from all the others?</p> <p><em>\u2022 Antisocial: How Online Extremists Broke America</em> by Andrew Marantz is published by Picador (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "Andrew Marantz is a staff writer for the New Yorker, and a pretty good one. He\u2019s written a lot of perceptive stuff about the tech industry in recent years. One morning in 2016, he was in his office exploring \u201ca particularly foul part of social media undergrowth\u201d, when the magazine\u2019s editor, David Remnick, came in, looked at the screen and asked: \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Marantz told him to sit down and watch. He repeated some of the Facebook searches he\u2019d been doing, bringing up toxic memes and propaganda posts and reading out the \u201cengagement\u201d statistics below each one: 5,000 shares here, 15,000 \u201cLikes\u201d there. Then he pulled up the New Yorker\u2019s Facebook page. A recent landmark piece got just 87 shares; Remnick\u2019s own piece about Aretha Franklin had even fewer \u2013 78 shares. And so on. \u201cI get it,\u201d said the editor. \u201cIt\u2019s not auspicious, but where\u2019s the story in it?\u201d Marantz pressed on, exploring the maze of pro-Trump propaganda and viral memes. \u201cWhat if I could find the people who are peddling this stuff?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat could be a story,\u201d Remnick replied. He was right, and this book tells that tale. To research it, Marantz frequented some of the nastiest circles of the American \u201calt-right\u201d, got to know some of the home-grown virtuosos of disinformation and disruption, embedded himself in a startup that specialises in exploiting online \u201cvirality\u201d, and reflected on the recent history of social media and its monetisation and amplification of hate, white supremacism and disinformation. His conclusions are not reassuring for anyone who regards a functioning public sphere and accountable media power as prerequisites for democracy. Early in the book, Marantz observes that \u201cTrump seemed to draw on pools of dark energy not previously observed within the universe of the American electorate\u201d. This supposed invisibility rather depends on historical amnesia. The white supremacism that manifested itself in 2016 has a long history, and not just in the deep south. Marantz himself traces its antecedents back to Lee Atwater \u2013 \u201cthe Paganini of the modern political dog-whistle\u201d \u2013 who worked for the sainted Ronald Reagan and was deputy director of his re-election campaign. Atwater popularised the \u201csouthern strategy\u201d of coded racism aimed at white voters in the deep south that turned many of them from Democrats to Republicans. (He later joined the lobbying firm co-founded by Paul Manafort and Roger Stone, names that have become familiar again since 2016.) Reagan\u2019s communications director was Pat Buchanan, who developed \u201cAmerica first\u201d from a blueprint established by Charles Lindbergh and his fellow Nazi admirers in the 1940s. And Reagan\u2019s campaign motto? \u201cLet\u2019s make America great again.\u201d There has always been a dark undercurrent of white supremacism in some sectors of American culture. It was kept from public view for decades by the editorial gatekeepers of the old media ecosystem. But once the internet arrived, a sophisticated online culture of conspiracy theorists, racists and other malign discontents thrived in cyberspace. But it stayed below the radar until a fully paid-up conspiracy theorist won the Republican nomination. Trump\u2019s candidacy and campaign had the effect of \u201cmainstreaming\u201d that which had previously been largely hidden from view. At which point, the innocent public began to see and experience what Marantz has closely observed, namely the remarkable capabilities of extremist \u201cedgelords\u201d to weaponise YouTube, Twitter and Facebook for destructive purposes. One of the most depressing things about 2016 was the apparent inability of American journalism to deal with this pollution of the public sphere. In part, this was because they were crippled by their professional standards. It\u2019s not always possible to be even-handed and honest. \u201cThe plain fact,\u201d writes Marantz at one point, \u201cwas that the alt-right was a racist movement full of creeps and liars. If a newspaper\u2019s house style didn\u2019t allow its reporters to say so, then the house style was preventing its reporters from telling the truth.\u201d Trump\u2019s mastery of Twitter led the news agenda every day, faithfully followed by mainstream media, like beagles following a live trail. And his use of the \u201cfake news\u201d metaphor was masterly: a reminder of why, as Marantz points out, L\u00fcgenpresse \u2013 \u201clying press\u201d \u2013 was also a favourite epithet of Joseph Goebbels. At the end of this absorbing and disturbing book, we are left with two awkward questions. One is whether digital technology \u2013 as controlled and deployed by a small number of unregulated tech corporations that derive their profits from monetising \u201cuser engagement\u201d (a polite term for prioritising dis- and misinformation, lies, outrage and nonsense) \u2013 now constitutes an existential threat to liberal democracy. And if the answer to that is yes, are we going to do anything about it before it\u2019s too late? Second, was the old media ecosystem, with its elitist gatekeepers, editorial control, political bias and other flaws, really worse than what we have acquired? Or, pace Winston Churchill on democracy, was it just the worst system apart from all the others? \u2022 Antisocial: How Online Extremists Broke America by Andrew Marantz is published by Picador (\u00a320).

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a stereotype that women don\u2019t play video games, but it couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. The numbers don\u2019t lie: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/17/women-video-games-iab\">52% of gamers were female in the UK\u2019s last major study in 2014</a>. But if we look at the proportion of female workers in the games industry, it\u2019s just <a href=\"https://ukie.org.uk/UK-games-industry-census-2020\">28% in the UK</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/453634/game-developer-gender-distribution-worldwide/\">roughly 20% worldwide</a>. If so many women are playing games, why are so few making them?</p> <p>The problem lies in the feedback loop of under-representation in the video games industry. Women are less likely to see themselves represented in games, games advertising or working in games design and development roles. That means they\u2019re less likely to pursue a degree or career, because they don\u2019t feel like they belong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jan/15/how-can-we-compete-with-google-the-battle-to-train-quantum-coders\">'How can we compete with Google?': the battle to train quantum coders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s more, gaming \u2013 much like the wider technology industry \u2013 has a culture problem. For many women working in games,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/16/anita-sarkeesian-its-frustrating-to-be-known-as-the-woman-who-survived-gamergate\"> sexual harassment online</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/sep/17/gaming-metoo-moment-harassment-women-in-games\">offline</a> has become commonplace, pay gaps persist, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jan/15/game-developer-quantic-dream-accused-of-toxic-and-sexist-working-environment\">toxic work culture</a> is pervasive.</p> <p>The representation gap begins at university, where more men have, historically, studied video games design. According to <a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/students/table-9\">Higher Education Statistics Agency data</a>, 88% of students on video games courses were male in 2017-18.</p> <p>\u201cMy course was very male-dominated. I think there were four or five women and maybe 25 men in my year,\u201d recalls <a href=\"http://www.katekillick.com/\">Kate Killick</a>, a senior designer at <a href=\"https://www.moji.works/\">Mojiworks</a> who studied video games design at the University of South Wales. \u201cAt the time I don\u2019t think I understood how it affected my experience, but looking back I can see I had imposter syndrome.\u201d</p> <p>The picture is steadily improving \u2013 the percentage of women studying video games design <a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/students/table-9\">grew from 7% in 2014</a><a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/students/table-9\">-15 to 11.5% in 2017</a><a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/students/table-9\">-18</a>. Some courses perform much better than others. Larra Anderson, the dean of screen at <a href=\"https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/london-college-of-communication\">London College of Communication</a> (LCC), part of University of the Arts London, says within the college\u2019s moving image and digital arts programme \u2013 which includes games design, virtual reality and animation \u2013 more than 50% of students are now women. \u201cThis has improved year-on-year for the last three years,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Andy Bossom, programme director of games at <a href=\"https://www.uca.ac.uk/\">University for the Creative Arts</a> (UCA), also says that his institution\u2019s games degrees have sustained a 60/40 male/female split for several years.</p> <p>A more evenly balanced mix of students is a good first step. But the nature of the programmes and games that are studied can have a big impact on a student\u2019s enjoyment of the course. \u201cBeing surrounded by people who were passionate about hardcore and AAA [blockbuster] games definitely made me question whether I counted as a \u2018gamer\u2019,\u201d Killick says.</p> <p>To address this, some universities frame video game design courses in ways to encourage diversity. Mariza Dima, a lecturer at Brunel University, says her university focuses on games design \u201cas a creative discipline, not just a technical one\u201d. Adam Procter, programme leader for the University of Southampton\u2019s game design course, agrees with that approach: \u201cIt\u2019s all about bringing ideas to life.\u201d</p> <p>To improve students\u2019 transition into the workplace, universities are increasingly connecting them with a diverse range of role models. \u201cThey need windows into their future, through an education that gets them the skills and practices through which they can master their craft,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cBut they also need mirrors which hold up images where they can see themselves reflected in their field as well. Without that they will not be inspired or see it as even possible for them to succeed.\u201d</p> <p>The games design courses at Brunel University, University of Southampton, LCC and UCA all invite female guest lecturers working in games. They also add games from a diverse range of creators to the course and hold events with industry experts who can share their own experiences and help students understand how they can fit into the industry. For example, LCC hosted the annual European conference for <a href=\"https://womeningamesconference.co.uk/\">Women in </a><a href=\"https://womeningamesconference.co.uk/\">Games</a>. \u201cOur students found it incredibly insightful and inspiring,\u201d recalls Anderson.</p> <p>An alternative for people who don\u2019t feel like they fit into the gaming industry is to start their own company, which universities are increasingly looking to facilitate. To this end, UCA set up a games incubator studio to support emerging developers and entrepreneurs. \u201cOne of the students we supported was indie games developer <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MeganWheeler.Cattap&amp;hl=en-GB\">Megan Wheeler</a><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MeganWheeler.Cattap&amp;hl=en-GB\">, the IP owner of Cat Tap</a>, which has had more than 100,000 downloads,\u201d Bossom says. \u201cWe supported her post-launch by promoting her game at leading UK games conferences.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, the responsibility for diversifying the games workforce doesn\u2019t just fall on universities. \u201cIt would be good to see a larger proportion of games companies being more forthcoming in their support to higher education: offering internships of different lengths, companies offering live briefs, and competitions to reward emerging talent,\u201d Bossom says. </p> <p>Equally, there\u2019s a role for teachers, thinks Killick. \u201cSchools need to be made aware of all the career opportunities in games, and tech in general. There\u2019s such a range of job roles, different types of companies, different genres and platforms you can work on,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve met parents who clearly didn\u2019t realise game development could be a serious career. They were shocked to visit us and realise we were a serious company, and not a handful of hobbyists in a garage!\u201d</p> <p>Killick suggests that universities and industry can work together to inform teachers, parents and pupils on \u201cwhat the industry is really like\u201d, for instance through open days featuring a range of students. </p> <p>Games themselves can also play a role in challenging the biases that hold women back from considering the industry as a valid career choice, starting with portraying them in a way that doesn\u2019t play into offensive stereotypes. Similarly, addressing gendered advertising and marketing, which often panders to young men, could make a big difference.</p> <p>\u201cI was always told I was unusual as a young girl enjoying video games, but that\u2019s just not true,\u201d says a games designer from the UK who wishes to remain anonymous. \u201cIf I had seen women in the games industry on TV, magazines or online, I think I would\u2019ve had the aspirations I have now much younger.\u201d</p> <p>The need for representation extends from nurturing aspirations to the hiring process. \u201cOne company made me have more than five separate interviews and there wasn\u2019t a single woman in any of them, so the first woman I spoke to was when I actually joined,\u201d recalls <a href=\"http://www.samantha-webb.com\">Samantha Webb</a>, a freelance narrative designer who studied game design at Brunel University.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/04/the-netflixisation-of-academia-is-this-the-end-for-university-lectures\">'The Netflixisation of academia': is this the end for university lectures?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dima blames the lack of flexible hours and work-life balance for limiting the pool of potential candidates: \u201cThe industry needs to understand the urgency to change its work culture and policy drastically, and the benefit and change this will bring to the sector as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>Numerous studies have shown that <a href=\"https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/3063/female_representation.pdf\">diverse teams create better work</a> and are more innovative. Without this, the feedback loop continues: men create games for other men who then go on to pursue a career in games.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody is a gamer now, so it makes sense for the industry to reflect the diversity of the audience,\u201d Killick says. \u201cWe make better games when people from different backgrounds bring their unique perspective and creativity to the table. I want to play those games, and I want to work with those people.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a stereotype that women don\u2019t play video games, but it couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. The numbers don\u2019t lie: 52% of gamers were female in the UK\u2019s last major study in 2014. But if we look at the proportion of female workers in the games industry, it\u2019s just 28% in the UK, and roughly 20% worldwide. If so many women are playing games, why are so few making them? The problem lies in the feedback loop of under-representation in the video games industry. Women are less likely to see themselves represented in games, games advertising or working in games design and development roles. That means they\u2019re less likely to pursue a degree or career, because they don\u2019t feel like they belong. What\u2019s more, gaming \u2013 much like the wider technology industry \u2013 has a culture problem. For many women working in games, sexual harassment online and offline has become commonplace, pay gaps persist, and toxic work culture is pervasive. The representation gap begins at university, where more men have, historically, studied video games design. According to Higher Education Statistics Agency data, 88% of students on video games courses were male in 2017-18. \u201cMy course was very male-dominated. I think there were four or five women and maybe 25 men in my year,\u201d recalls Kate Killick, a senior designer at Mojiworks who studied video games design at the University of South Wales. \u201cAt the time I don\u2019t think I understood how it affected my experience, but looking back I can see I had imposter syndrome.\u201d The picture is steadily improving \u2013 the percentage of women studying video games design grew from 7% in 2014-15 to 11.5% in 2017-18. Some courses perform much better than others. Larra Anderson, the dean of screen at London College of Communication (LCC), part of University of the Arts London, says within the college\u2019s moving image and digital arts programme \u2013 which includes games design, virtual reality and animation \u2013 more than 50% of students are now women. \u201cThis has improved year-on-year for the last three years,\u201d she says. Andy Bossom, programme director of games at University for the Creative Arts (UCA), also says that his institution\u2019s games degrees have sustained a 60/40 male/female split for several years. A more evenly balanced mix of students is a good first step. But the nature of the programmes and games that are studied can have a big impact on a student\u2019s enjoyment of the course. \u201cBeing surrounded by people who were passionate about hardcore and AAA [blockbuster] games definitely made me question whether I counted as a \u2018gamer\u2019,\u201d Killick says. To address this, some universities frame video game design courses in ways to encourage diversity. Mariza Dima, a lecturer at Brunel University, says her university focuses on games design \u201cas a creative discipline, not just a technical one\u201d. Adam Procter, programme leader for the University of Southampton\u2019s game design course, agrees with that approach: \u201cIt\u2019s all about bringing ideas to life.\u201d To improve students\u2019 transition into the workplace, universities are increasingly connecting them with a diverse range of role models. \u201cThey need windows into their future, through an education that gets them the skills and practices through which they can master their craft,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cBut they also need mirrors which hold up images where they can see themselves reflected in their field as well. Without that they will not be inspired or see it as even possible for them to succeed.\u201d The games design courses at Brunel University, University of Southampton, LCC and UCA all invite female guest lecturers working in games. They also add games from a diverse range of creators to the course and hold events with industry experts who can share their own experiences and help students understand how they can fit into the industry. For example, LCC hosted the annual European conference for Women in Games. \u201cOur students found it incredibly insightful and inspiring,\u201d recalls Anderson. An alternative for people who don\u2019t feel like they fit into the gaming industry is to start their own company, which universities are increasingly looking to facilitate. To this end, UCA set up a games incubator studio to support emerging developers and entrepreneurs. \u201cOne of the students we supported was indie games developer Megan Wheeler, the IP owner of Cat Tap, which has had more than 100,000 downloads,\u201d Bossom says. \u201cWe supported her post-launch by promoting her game at leading UK games conferences.\u201d Of course, the responsibility for diversifying the games workforce doesn\u2019t just fall on universities. \u201cIt would be good to see a larger proportion of games companies being more forthcoming in their support to higher education: offering internships of different lengths, companies offering live briefs, and competitions to reward emerging talent,\u201d Bossom says. Equally, there\u2019s a role for teachers, thinks Killick. \u201cSchools need to be made aware of all the career opportunities in games, and tech in general. There\u2019s such a range of job roles, different types of companies, different genres and platforms you can work on,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve met parents who clearly didn\u2019t realise game development could be a serious career. They were shocked to visit us and realise we were a serious company, and not a handful of hobbyists in a garage!\u201d Killick suggests that universities and industry can work together to inform teachers, parents and pupils on \u201cwhat the industry is really like\u201d, for instance through open days featuring a range of students. Games themselves can also play a role in challenging the biases that hold women back from considering the industry as a valid career choice, starting with portraying them in a way that doesn\u2019t play into offensive stereotypes. Similarly, addressing gendered advertising and marketing, which often panders to young men, could make a big difference. \u201cI was always told I was unusual as a young girl enjoying video games, but that\u2019s just not true,\u201d says a games designer from the UK who wishes to remain anonymous. \u201cIf I had seen women in the games industry on TV, magazines or online, I think I would\u2019ve had the aspirations I have now much younger.\u201d The need for representation extends from nurturing aspirations to the hiring process. \u201cOne company made me have more than five separate interviews and there wasn\u2019t a single woman in any of them, so the first woman I spoke to was when I actually joined,\u201d recalls Samantha Webb, a freelance narrative designer who studied game design at Brunel University. Dima blames the lack of flexible hours and work-life balance for limiting the pool of potential candidates: \u201cThe industry needs to understand the urgency to change its work culture and policy drastically, and the benefit and change this will bring to the sector as a whole.\u201d Numerous studies have shown that diverse teams create better work and are more innovative. Without this, the feedback loop continues: men create games for other men who then go on to pursue a career in games. \u201cEverybody is a gamer now, so it makes sense for the industry to reflect the diversity of the audience,\u201d Killick says. \u201cWe make better games when people from different backgrounds bring their unique perspective and creativity to the table. I want to play those games, and I want to work with those people.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Banning the import and export of big game hunting trophies would recognise the destructive impact European powers have had on wildlife in former African and Asian colonies, Sir Ranulph Fiennes has said. Speaking to the Guardian, the veteran British explorer said hunting endangered species such as rhinos, elephants and lions to keep their body parts as trophies should be viewed with the same scepticism as Chinese traditional medicine in terms of the damage it does to biodiversity. The 75-year-old explorer, who spent a large part of his childhood in South Africa, has called for trophy hunting to be \u201cstopped country by country\u201d and said efforts to halt the extinction of wildlife around the world were hypocritical while big game hunting was still allowed. Reflecting on his early years in Cape Town and the influence of the British empire on trophy hunting, Fiennes said: \u201cJust as much as the Belgians in the Congo and the French elsewhere, they unleashed the plague of persecuting animals \u2013 not like the locals did to eat, but purely for the pleasure of killing. That started the devastating damage to many, many wonderful species.\u201d Comparing trophy hunting with the demand for ingredients such as powdered rhino horn in traditional medicine in Asia, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not medically proven in any way. And yes, it goes on. China is particularly guilty, as are South Korea and many other countries in that area. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the empire lot and the weird medical quack lot both going on to this current day and it\u2019s got to be stopped country by country. We can stop it in the UK at least and thereby feel slightly less guilty because of our ancestors.\u201d Fiennes\u2019s comments come during a consultation by the British government on applying controls to trophy hunting, including a proposal to ban imports, that was laid out in the Queen\u2019s speech. In the wake of the death of Cecil the lion in 2015, France, Netherlands and Australia introduced bans on the import of lion trophies. Last year, the Guardian revealed lion bones, leopard skulls and an ottoman chair\u2019s elephant leather were among the 74 rare animal body parts legally brought into the UK in 2018. Under international rules overseen by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), trophies can be moved around the world if they do not affect the survival of a species. Fiennes said: \u201cBearing in mind that climate change is helping to remove animals and in 50 years time probably humans as well, now is the time for us to get into a position without being hypocritical. \u201cWe are all hoping that Boris will see that cruelty is what we\u2019re talking about \u2013 bullying bastards are involved and people who are vain sticking lovely dead animals on their walls.\u201d In America, Donald Trump has previously spoken out against big-game trophy hunting despite Donald Trump Jr being a keen hunter. A week-long \u201cdream hunt\u201d with the US president\u2019s son was auctioned off earlier this month at an annual trophy hunting convention organised by Safari Club International (SCI), where it went for $150,000. Another lot offered the chance to shoot an elephant on a 14-day trip to Namibia. Supporters of trophy hunting such as SCI argue that the practise supports conservation efforts for endangered wildlife. The organisation said it had written to the governments of Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe in relation to the proposed trophy hunting import ban in the UK. When contacted by the Guardian about the trophy hunting consultation that ends on 25 February, a Defra spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing the pre-election and Christmas periods, we are extending the trophy hunting consultation by one month to ensure all interested parties are able to have their say.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

      "bodyText": "The library at Thebes was said to have the inscription \u201cMedicine for the soul\u201d above its doors \u2013 a notion Bradford council is set to put to the test with plans to offset major library cuts with funds from its health and wellbeing budget. The West Yorkshire council is just one of the local authorities up and down the country which has dealt with shrinking reserves by closing hundreds of libraries. Last year, it proposed chopping \u00a32 million from its libraries spending over two years, a funding reduction of two-thirds. The biggest cut of \u00a31.05m was due to hit at the start of this coming financial year, until the council came up with what could be described as a novel idea. At a January meeting, a rescue package was proposed \u2014 diverting funds from the council\u2019s health and wellbeing budget to reduce the impact of the cuts on libraries. If the decision is ratified by the full meeting of the council\u2019s executive on 4 March, it will mean injecting \u00a3700,000 into libraries, dramatically reducing the proposed cuts for the coming financial year and alleviating fears voiced by library campaigners and staff \u2014 who took strike action in October in protest against the cuts \u2014 that job losses and branch closures would be inevitable. Not only that, but the proposal on the table is for a recurring annual investment of that amount. If the decision is passed, then it will be a firm commitment and recognition by Bradford that libraries really are medicine for the soul \u2013 an inspiration for other authorities who facing savage library cuts. This week, Bradford Metropolitan District Council announced it was opening a consultation process for residents to give their views on the proposals and was also \u201cexploring wider funding opportunities which would help support ambitions for a sustainable library service which meets the needs of local communities\u201d. Councillor Susan Hinchcliffe, the leader of Bradford Council who will be presiding over the meeting next month, said the council\u2019s focus \u201chas to be on preventing ill-health in the first place, not dealing with it after the fact. And libraries have a big part to play in that.\u201d \u201cA huge number of the decisions we have to make at the council are about the health and wellbeing of people,\u201d Hinchcliffe said. \u201cBooks are of course hugely important in libraries but there are many other aspects. The social interaction they provide is vital, especially for isolated people. They host clubs and events, they provide information and access to the internet. \u201cWe are remodelling how libraries work to meet the needs of the health agenda. Libraries are symbols of community and we have to be passionate about libraries and how they serve these communities.\u201d Bradford council\u2019s decision was taken internally, the council confirmed, with no outside experts called in. But according to Dr Ricky Lawton, co-author of a 2015 Arts Council report into libraries and health, the link between libraries and wellbeing is well established. \u201cWe interviewed two large groups, library users and non-users, and library usage was associated with higher levels of happiness and satisfaction,\u201d Lawton said. \u201cWhat\u2019s often important to councils in these situations is the cultural value of a service ... We know libraries are beneficial anecdotally, but with our research we tried to look at how valuable they were in monetary terms, by asking people if they would hypothetically be prepared to pay for the services they receive.\u201d This was the first time he had heard of a local authority putting funds from health provision into library services, he continued, but \u201cBradford putting money from its health and wellbeing budget into libraries does seem to suggest they are subscribing to our research\u201d. Users at Bradford\u2019s City Library tended to agree. \u201cLibraries have tangible benefits for health,\u201d said regular library user Paul Davies, \u201cespecially mental health.\u201d Another regular library user, Frances, who lives in nearby Shipley agreed. \u201cI would say that libraries are definitely good for health and wellbeing,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just in terms of reading and what that gives you, but also the social aspect of visiting a library, especially for people who live on their own.\u201d A Bradford libraries card holder since the 1970s, she welcomed the initiative: \u201cIt\u2019s entirely appropriate to spend money from the health and wellbeing budget on libraries.

Antonio Finelli came to the country in 1952 when he answered an appeal for immigrant labour as part of the reconstruction effort after the second world war ended. He was welcomed with one week\u2019s advance wages and a sandwich when he arrived at Folkestone harbour, but almost 70 years later says he has been forced to supply 80 pages of bank statements to prove his right to stay in the UK. He was asked for proof that he had been in the country for five consecutive years when he applied for the EU settlement scheme, but the Home Office app said it could not find any record of him. \u201cIt is wrong,\u201d he said as he waited for volunteers\u2019 help at an advice centre in Islington, north London. His wife and only son have died and he is also worried about his grandchildren. \u201cWill they be OK?\u201d he asked the volunteer. \u201cIt was a surprise because I have had the aliens\u2019 certificate,\u201d he said referring to the document given to immigrants who came to the country between 1918 and 1957. \u201cI\u2019ve been receiving the pension and working all my life so I don\u2019t understand why I have to provide these bank statements,\u201d he said. Finelli\u2019s case highlights concerns over stress and anxiety being caused to elderly and vulnerable people, many of whom do not understand why they are being asked for paperwork at this stage of their lives. Dimitri Scarlato, a volunteer at Inca CGIL, an advice centre for Italian citizens, said he has had one woman in the centre who was so stressed out about having to find paperwork she \u201cthought she was going to have a heart attack\u201d. \u201cWhat I find unacceptable is that Mr Finelli has been living here for 70 years. He has been here all his life. He worked for 40 years and [after] 32 years received his pension.

Why?\u201d said Scarlato. Finelli is the second case in a week of elderly EU citizens struggling with the settled status application which all EU and EEA citizens need to complete in order to stay in the UK after June next year. Last week it emerged that a 101-year-old, Giovanni Palmiero, who coincidentally knew Finelli as a child in Italy, had been told to get his parents to apply on his behalf because the Home Office system thought he was a one-year-old. Scarlato fears that the problem may be much bigger and affects tens of thousands of pensioners if DWP records are not all digitised. \u201cWe think this is because the DWP records are not digitised. We have tried to raise this with the Home Office because we are seeing many elderly people come in whose records cannot be found,\u201d said Scarlato. He says he has had more than 100 applications where records cannot be found. \u201cI\u2019ve processed around 500 applications and half of them are for elderly people. Half these people have not been found by the system and it asks them to prove their residency even though the DWP has been sending out pensions and have been here since the 1950s and 1960s. \u201cImagine an elderly person who doesn\u2019t have his name on any bill and has no proof of residence and they have been here all these years and they get to their 80s and 90s and are asked to prove they have been here for five years. \u201cMr Finelli will be fine because he has come to the centre, but what if you are living alone and vulnerable or in the middle of nowhere and don\u2019t know where to go?\u201d said Scarlato. Alberto Costa, a Tory MP and longtime champion of EU citizens, said he had in the past repeatedly \u201craised with ministers the expected problem with digital records for vulnerable and elderly people who may need to prove their residence even though they have been here for 50 to 60 years\u201d. The Home Office said applicants\u2019 HMRC and DWP records were automatically matched when EU citizens applied for settled status when it launched the computer and phone app last March. The Guardian asked the Home Office if there was a digitisation problem with pension records but it declined to answer the specific question. \u201cAutomated checks mean that the vast majority of applicants don\u2019t have to provide additional evidence, but when it\u2019s needed there is a vast range of evidence people can submit, including doctor\u2019s notes, payslips and letters from charities,\u201d it said.

      "body": "<p>Some years ago, my husband and I visited old friends who were preparing to move house. When we were leaving, we told them to let us know if they needed any help. A few weeks later, we were surprised when they called us and asked if we could help on the day of the move. We didn\u2019t mind, but just had not expected our vague offer of help to be taken up. \u201cShout if you need anything,\u201d is just something you say, isn\u2019t it?</p> <p>A few years later, in 2016, I went from being a pregnant mother of a toddler to a cancer patient overnight. I did things that seem, looking back, unthinkable, such as undergoing surgery while pregnant and starting chemotherapy when my daughter was one week old and still in intensive care in a hospital 60 miles from home. My husband, son and I had moved from London to Leicestershire a few months before, and we didn\u2019t know many people in our new village. Friends from afar, all with young families of their own, sent flowers, chocolates and books, all of which helped. But what we lacked was on-the-ground support.</p> <p>Perhaps oddly, it wasn\u2019t surgery or chemo that broke me in the end. It was about 18 months later, when my husband was in hospital because of his Crohn\u2019s disease. I was looking after our two young children on my own, and my daughter fell down the stairs from top to bottom. She was unharmed, but I started crying and couldn\u2019t stop. It became clear to me, in that moment, that I needed help.</p> <p>Why is asking for help so hard? Are we afraid of showing weakness, preferring to keep up our social media image of picture-perfect lives? Or is it that we don\u2019t feel we deserve it, that everyone else is busy and overwhelmed too, and why should they put all of that to one side to give us a hand? The way we live now, so many of us settled far from our extended family, with both parents working as we try to juggle an array of childcare, hoping against hope that our children don\u2019t get ill on the day of our big deadline/meeting/presentation, leaves so much space for help. And yet we chat at the school gate or nursery pickup, never asking for or offering it.</p> <p>I had been documenting my breast cancer experience in a blog and had built up a following of local friends and associates. So on the day of my daughter\u2019s fall, I wrote a post asking for help. The responses flooded in immediately. People want to help, I realised. They\u2019re just not always sure how, or what to offer. If you reach out, they reach back.</p> <p>Within a couple of days, I had a new WhatsApp group with about 20 people to call on in tough times. And that I did. Once, when I was stuck at a hospital and thought I might need someone to pick up my daughter from nursery. Another time just to ask advice about a minor injury.

      "bodyText": "Some years ago, my husband and I visited old friends who were preparing to move house. When we were leaving, we told them to let us know if they needed any help. A few weeks later, we were surprised when they called us and asked if we could help on the day of the move. We didn\u2019t mind, but just had not expected our vague offer of help to be taken up. \u201cShout if you need anything,\u201d is just something you say, isn\u2019t it? A few years later, in 2016, I went from being a pregnant mother of a toddler to a cancer patient overnight. I did things that seem, looking back, unthinkable, such as undergoing surgery while pregnant and starting chemotherapy when my daughter was one week old and still in intensive care in a hospital 60 miles from home. My husband, son and I had moved from London to Leicestershire a few months before, and we didn\u2019t know many people in our new village. Friends from afar, all with young families of their own, sent flowers, chocolates and books, all of which helped. But what we lacked was on-the-ground support. Perhaps oddly, it wasn\u2019t surgery or chemo that broke me in the end. It was about 18 months later, when my husband was in hospital because of his Crohn\u2019s disease. I was looking after our two young children on my own, and my daughter fell down the stairs from top to bottom. She was unharmed, but I started crying and couldn\u2019t stop. It became clear to me, in that moment, that I needed help. Why is asking for help so hard? Are we afraid of showing weakness, preferring to keep up our social media image of picture-perfect lives? Or is it that we don\u2019t feel we deserve it, that everyone else is busy and overwhelmed too, and why should they put all of that to one side to give us a hand? The way we live now, so many of us settled far from our extended family, with both parents working as we try to juggle an array of childcare, hoping against hope that our children don\u2019t get ill on the day of our big deadline/meeting/presentation, leaves so much space for help. And yet we chat at the school gate or nursery pickup, never asking for or offering it. I had been documenting my breast cancer experience in a blog and had built up a following of local friends and associates. So on the day of my daughter\u2019s fall, I wrote a post asking for help. The responses flooded in immediately. People want to help, I realised. They\u2019re just not always sure how, or what to offer. If you reach out, they reach back. Within a couple of days, I had a new WhatsApp group with about 20 people to call on in tough times. And that I did. Once, when I was stuck at a hospital and thought I might need someone to pick up my daughter from nursery. Another time just to ask advice about a minor injury. Or when I needed a lift to an appointment. It is usually enough to know it is there, quite honestly. Two months ago, I had my biggest operation yet: breast reconstruction using tissue from my tummy. I was under anaesthetic for 11 hours and told to expect to be out of action for up to 12 weeks. A little more practised now, I asked my network for help. They came forward offering playdates, pickups and meals. One friend who doesn\u2019t have children said she didn\u2019t feel able to offer childcare but really wanted to cook us some meals.

Following the signposted Jack Mytton Way, the route up the Carding Mill valley from the market town of Church Stretton gradually builds the suspense until, with a last heave, walkers emerge blinking on to the mighty ridge. Then it\u2019s a sumptuous, mile-long hike to the viewtastic summit at Pole Bank. \u2022 Getting there: walk from Church Stretton station, which has trains to Manchester and Cardiff Cnoc Mor, Ross and Cromarty Height: 269m, prominence: 164m Just outside the village of Strathpeffer, several footpaths pierce the dense pines of Blackmuir Wood. Choose a leisurely or a more abrupt ascent to the Cat\u2019s Back ridge, from where it\u2019s a short pull up to the summit for views of Loch Ussie and the Cromarty Firth. On your return, take in the Touchstone Maze, where 81 rocks chosen from around northern Scotland align with the solstices. \u2022 Getting there: no 27 or 700 bus from Dingwall to Strathpeffer Moel Siabod, Conwy Height: 872m, prominence: 600m Just qualifying as a P600 (prominence of 600 metres or more), Moel Siabod is the tallest mountain in Snowdonia\u2019s Moelwynion range. The easiest ascent begins at the Plas y Brenin national outdoor centre, passing through a large Forestry Commission plantation and up the northern face. The prize at the top is a spectacular view \u2013 it\u2019s said 13 of the highest peaks in Wales can be seen on a clear day. \u2022 Getting there: from Betws-y-Coed station, take the S2 bus to Capel Curig Kit Hill, Cornwall Height: 334m, prominence: 171m One of five Cornish Marilyns, Kit Hill is at the heart of a 400-acre country park. Neolithic and bronze age burial mounds testify that this was once a sacred site. More recently, quantities of silver, tin, copper and tungsten have been extracted from multiple mines. Their remains can still be seen today, alongside a lofty Victorian chimney stack at the summit that once served a steam engine that pumped water and lifted ore from the mine below. \u2022 Getting there: from Saltash or Plymouth, take the no 12A bus to Downgate and walk for 1\u00bd miles Merrick, Dumfries and Galloway Height: 843m, prominence: 705m The only P700 (and also a Corbett) in south-west Scotland, Merrick is one of the \u201cfingers\u201d of the splendidly named Range of the Awful Hand. A lengthy path leads to a remote summit, whose views are remarkable. Choose a pleasant day and see the Lake District, the Mulls of Galloway and Kintyre, Ailsa Craig and all the way across to Northern Ireland. \u2022 Getting there: from Girvan railway station take the 359 bus to Glentrool village. It\u2019s a 4-mile trek up Glen Trool to the start of the track by Bruce\u2019s Stone Looking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips",

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and this is your run-down of the top stories this Monday.</p> \n<p>Media coverage of Caroline Flack has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/16/politicians-condemn-press-intrusion-after-caroline-flacks-death\">widely condemned</a> after the death of the Love Island presenter at the weekend, weeks before her trial for assaulting her partner was due to begin. Labour leadership hopeful Keir Starmer said some stories had \u201camplified\u201d damaging social media posts about the 40-year-old star, who is believed to have taken her own life, and that he would push for ways to \u201cdiversify\u201d the press if he was party leader. The Lib Dem MP Daisy Cooper said Flack had been \u201chounded\u201d by parts of the media. The cabinet minister Grant Shapps, speaking on Sky News, argued that there was a duty of care for everybody involved in such cases, including the crown prosecution service, which has been criticised for pushing ahead with the assault case. Prominent barristers have also highlighted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/feb/16/barristers-warn-of-strain-on-defendants-caroline-flack-death\">the strain placed on defendants in domestic abuse cases.</a></p> \n<p>ITV has also been criticised for failing to stand by Flack when the charges were laid as the case <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/16/caroline-flack-death-turns-spotlight-on-tabloids-once-again\">turns the spotlight back on tabloid intrusion</a>. The station cancelled its episode of Love Island last night but will air a tribute to Flack tonight.

Media coverage of Caroline Flack has been widely condemned after the death of the Love Island presenter at the weekend, weeks before her trial for assaulting her partner was due to begin. Labour leadership hopeful Keir Starmer said some stories had \u201camplified\u201d damaging social media posts about the 40-year-old star, who is believed to have taken her own life, and that he would push for ways to \u201cdiversify\u201d the press if he was party leader. The Lib Dem MP Daisy Cooper said Flack had been \u201chounded\u201d by parts of the media. The cabinet minister Grant Shapps, speaking on Sky News, argued that there was a duty of care for everybody involved in such cases, including the crown prosecution service, which has been criticised for pushing ahead with the assault case. Prominent barristers have also highlighted the strain placed on defendants in domestic abuse cases. ITV has also been criticised for failing to stand by Flack when the charges were laid as the case turns the spotlight back on tabloid intrusion. The station cancelled its episode of Love Island last night but will air a tribute to Flack tonight. Laura Whitmore, who succeeded Flack as host of Love Island, suggested on Five Live that media coverage had contributed to her friend\u2019s death. Our TV writer Tim Jonze says Flack\u2019s fragility and openness made her the perfect fit as Love Island host. And you can read our obituary of her here. * * * Dennis deluge \u2013 A record number of flood warnings have been issued across the country after Storm Dennis lashed Britain with heavy rain and strong winds, inundating thousands of homes and causing widespread disruption to transport. Only a week after Storm Ciara brought a similar deluge, major incidents were declared in south Wales and parts of England. Pontypridd, north of Cardiff, was under water and faced being cut off for several days after roads were blocked by rising waters and landslides. Hundreds of flights were cancelled across Britain and roads and railways were submerged, with commuters facing a chaotic journey to work for the second Monday in a row. * * * Japan warning \u2013 Japan is facing a deepening crisis over the coronavirus outbreak after 70 more cases were detected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, along with six new cases on the mainland. Experts say the country, which is the worst affected after China, is still in the \u201cearly stages\u201d of the outbreak with 59 confirmed cases along with 355 on the ship. The health system is straining to cope, with a hospital near Tokyo forced to stop accepting new patients on Monday. The outbreak, which has now infected more than 71,000 people worldwide and killed 1,775, could also force the Tokyo Marathon set for 1 March to be scaled down. Chinese competitors have been asked to defer entry until next year. In China an activist has been arrested for criticising president Xi Jinping and in Hong Kong an armed gang has stolen a shipment of toilet rolls as panic-buying grips the city. * * * Rogue surgeon \u2013 A private healthcare firm is under scrutiny after a second case emerged of a doctor who subjected patients to unnecessary operations that left many of them in pain. Spire Healthcare was already in the spotlight after an independent inquiry into rogue breast surgeon Ian Paterson, who is serving 20 years in jail for mistreating patients. The Guardian reveals today that Michael Walsh, a shoulder surgeon, was sacked by Spire after patients and colleagues raised concerns about his work. An investigation uncovered examples of Walsh harming patients by performing surgery on them unnecessarily or badly.

Today in Focus podcast Tom Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, is back in Venezuela a year after the start of a dramatic, but so far unsuccessful, attempt to topple Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. While conditions in Caracas appear slightly improved, outside the capital conditions in schools and hospitals are appalling \u2013 and getting worse. Lunchtime read: James Taylor on The Beatles, Joni and Trump We have an astonishingly frank interview today with singer-songwriter James Taylor in which he discusses his turbulent childhood, his heroin addiction and his relationship with Joni Mitchell. Promoting his new album in London, he recalls hanging out with the Beatles (\u201cI was a bad influence\u201d), life in Hollywood\u2019s legendary Laurel Canyon (\u201cIt really was a perfect moment\u201d) and, of course, Trump (\u201cIt\u2019s like the Confederacy has won the civil war\u201d). Sport Mikel Arteta has said Pep Guardiola and Manchester City are \u201csuffering\u201d after Uefa handed the club a two\u2011season ban from the Champions League and a \u20ac30m (\u00a325m) fine. The club could also face sanctions in the Premier League, potentially being docked points, as the ramifications of the ruling reach far and wide. Arteta\u2019s Arsenal team cut loose in the second half to beat Newcastle 4-0 in the Premier League at the Emirates Stadium, while Son Heung-min capitalised on Bjorn Engels\u2019 error to score a late winner for Tottenham as they beat Aston Villa 3-2. A superb innings from Eoin Morgan reeled in South Africa in an extraordinary run chase that gave England a 2-1 T20 series win. Lisa Keightley\u2019s England will consider themselves contenders for the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup in Australia, which begins at the end of the week, despite the hosts\u2019 status as clear favourites. England fly-half George Ford has predicted Ireland will be firing at Twickenham when the two sides meet in the Six Nations on Sunday. And the BBC has said it will no longer use the pundit Craig Ramage after the former midfielder criticised Derby County\u2019s \u201cyoung black lads\u201d, saying they needed \u201cbringing down a peg or two\u201d. Business The housing market is experiencing its most optimistic conditions for several years after the latest survey suggested the average asking price for a home rose \u00a32,500 in the past month to \u00a3309,399 in February, just shy of its all-time record. Rightmove said buyers and sellers have been invigorated by renewed economic confidence, described as a post-election bounce. The FTSE100 is expected to rise by around 0.25% this morning while the pound is at $1.30 and \u20ac1.20. The papers The front pages are divided mainly between three stories this morning. Caroline Flack\u2019s picture is featured on most of them and her death is also the lead in the Mail \u2013 \u201cFlack feared a \u2018show trial\u2019\u201d \u2013 and the Metro \u2013 \u201cMy heart is broken\u201d. The floods also feature strongly and lead the Mirror \u2013\u201cWe have lost it all\u201d \u2013 and the i \u2013 \u201cStorm Dennis sets flood alert record\u201d. The Times splashes with \u201cEurope talks tough on trade\u201d and the Express has the same story \u2013 \u201cEU threat of Brexit trade bloodbath\u201d. The Guardian leads with \u201cDoctor at rogue breast surgeon firm accused of harming patients\u201d, while the Telegraph also has a health-related lead: \u201cDementia patients dumped in hospitals\u201d. The FT goes with \u201cVision Fund chief pushes equities vehicle after SoftBank stumbles\u201d.

      "bodyText": "New shipping pollution regulations introduced earlier this year could harm humans by contaminating fish and crustaceans with toxins, according to an internal report compiled by the International Maritime Organization and obtained by the Guardian. In the report the IMO, the United Nations agency responsible for regulating shipping, says that there is insufficient \u201ctoxicity data\u201d to be able to assess the risk to humans caused by the increased use of exhaust gas cleaning systems, which are also known as \u201cscrubbers\u201d. These devices reduce the amount of pollution emitted into the air by ships, but the cheapest and most popular models dramatically increase the amount of pollutants pumped directly into the sea. Shipping companies have spent more than $12bn (\u00a39.2bn) fitting thousands of scrubbers on vessels around the world in order to meet new air pollution standards that were introduced on 1 January 2020. Some of the pollutants deemed most concerning by experts that are pumped into the sea by scrubbers are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have been linked to skin, lung, bladder, liver and stomach cancers. In its report, the IMO says \u201ccarrying out a preliminary risk assessment [on the PAH emissions from scrubbers] was not possible considering the available information\u201d and warns that \u201csecondary poisoning (via consumption of seafood) had been mentioned as a likely exposure route for humans\u201d. Critics say IMO member states should have conducted thorough risk assessments before deciding to allow the use of scrubbers under the new legislation. Lucy Gilliam, a campaigner for the Brussels-based NGO Transport &amp; Environment, says the IMO should stop the use of scrubbers until it can answer key questions about how discharges may affect health. \u201cShips should not be allowed to use scrubbers if the IMO has no idea what the consequences will be for human health and food chain contamination,\u201d she said. \u201cThe surge in scrubber use means that increasing amounts of PAHs will accumulate in sediment over time, and no one knows what the impact on human health will be. \u201cIt is going to have an impact on the food chain and, as things stand, we have no reliable information about when safe threshold limits will be breached.\u201d Christopher Elliott, a professor at the Institute for Global Food Security at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, believes the effect of bioaccumulation of PAHs in the food chain is a worrying issue. \u201cAny increase in PAHs at the bottom of the food chain can have a negative impact on human health over the long term, damaging immune systems and potentially increasing susceptibility to cancer,\u201d he said. Shipping companies have repeatedly said that they have commissioned rigorous studies to test pollutants discharged by scrubbers. Earlier this year a study commissioned by Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) Europe, the world\u2019s largest cruise industry trade association, concluded that \u201cexhaust gas cleaning systems have a limited impact on water quality\u201d. In March last year Carnival, the world\u2019s biggest cruise company, published a study that described scrubbers as \u201ca safe and effective\u201d way of complying with the recently implemented regulations for cleaner air emissions. The Clean Shipping Alliance, a lobby group for companies that have invested in exhaust gas cleaning technology, says it believes that sufficient research has been conducted and discharges from the devices are safe for marine ecosystems. \u201cThere is well-documented evidence relating to the composition of scrubber washwater,\u201d a spokesperson said. However, in the IMO\u2019s new internal report it criticises the existing body of research that been published based on analysis of chemical discharge from the devices, saying that some of the existing studies cannot be trusted. \u201cIn a number of reports, no basic information was provided either on the sampling techniques, or on the quality assurance and control of the analytical methods used,\u201d it says. \u201cLack of all this information put a great uncertainty on a number of presented results and the quality of the provided data could not be fully judged and trusted.\u201d Gilliam says many of the existing studies looking at chemical discharges from scrubbers have been done by entities that benefit financially from the use of them. \u201cIn some cases they are commissioning studies by independent groups, but the samples are being collected by their own staff,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do we know exactly where they are taking the sample from, at what time, at what engine load?

There is his tender, sensitive Birmingham Project, for which he photographed an array of black subjects inside a historically black church located in Birmingham, Alabama, a city that experienced multiple church bombings during the civil rights movement. The photographs are diptychs: on one side are portraits of black kids who are the same age as those lost in Birmingham\u2019s church bombings; on the other, black men and women the same age those murdered in the bombing would be today, if they had lived. And there\u2019s the 2017 series Night Coming Tenderly, Black, a poetic and lyrical exploration of what the fugitive slaves escaping through the Underground Railroad might have felt and seen under the cloak of night. Bey strives to expand how the black experience is seen and understood through his photographs. \u201cWhat I hope to create is work that makes it apparent that black people exist not only in a social world,\u201d Beys says at the press preview for the SF Moma opening, \u201cbut they also have rich interior lives as human beings.\u201d Bey decided to become a photographer after going to a protest of the 1969 exhibition Harlem On My Mind, at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. Bey had gone to witness the planned demonstration after black artists and photographers were excluded from an exhibition that was focused on a predominantly black neighborhood. However, when Bey arrived, there was no protest. So Bey viewed the exhibition and found himself struck by the work. He walked out with a clear vision: he wanted to insert black voices and faces into the museum space. Early projects by Bey, such as Harlem, USA and Syracuse, NY, mine the effortless wealth and beauty of black people. The portraits have minimal staging and highlight how, not too long ago, black hubs thrived in cities. \u201cI would never know the narratives of the individuals before I made their portrait,\u201d Bey says, reflecting on the early projects. \u201cThe picture-making moment is when I would begin to find out something about the person. My greater responsibility was to give them a compelling representation and presence.\u201d Bey\u2019s early work takes on darker tones through his revisitation of Harlem as a subject, from 2014-2017. This time, Bey captures Harlem through the harsh, whitewashed lens of a digital camera, focusing on the rampant gentrification occurring. The subject has changed from happy, smiling black children to barren construction sites and white men eating at cafes and working on their sleek laptops. The absence of blackness is noticeable. In the early aughts, Bey became interested in a different kind of marginalized, misunderstood group: Teenagers. His series Class Pictures takes portraits of teenagers shot in empty classrooms and pairs them with personal narratives penned by the young subjects. The approach gives the teenagers control over how viewers see them \u2013 preventing us from throwing preconceived notions and ideas on to them. In a way, Class Pictures highlights how the need for multidimensional representation is a universal human need, not a racial one. At the press preview for the San Francisco exhibition, Dawoud Bey: An American Project, the artist sits on a bench, looking at his early work over forty years removed. \u201cWhen I look at these photos, I think, \u2018That guy\u2019s good!\u2019\u201d Bey exclaims, followed by a hearty chuckle. Looking back is an unusual practice for Bey, he says. He always has his eye on the future. (\u201cI am always most interested in whatever I am currently working on.\u201d) Taking in his work in 2020, when black artists are still fighting to be seen and celebrated, it\u2019s impossible not to wonder how Bey navigated the art world when there were fewer conversations about diversity and inclusion. As a black photographer, how did Bey create room to make work about whatever he wanted? So often black creatives are pigeonholed and pressured to focus on race. \u201cThe work can be about the black subject without the black subject being literally and prominently in the work,\u201d he says, using the dark, shadowed photographs he captured for Night Coming Tenderly, Black as an example. \u201cThose are about the black body moving through space.\u201d He nods, reflective: \u201cBlackness is not a straitjacket on the imagination.\u201d Dawoud Bey: An American Project runs from 15 February to 25 May at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art",

Variously diagnosed with autism, dyspraxia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder\" title=\"\">ADHD</a> and more, he is now officially understood as having a learning disability with complex needs. As a child who liked cycling and dancing, and had the same caring nature he still displays, he moved through an array of educational placements before, in late 2012, he ended up at a now-defunct residential school near his home.

This required the consent of his parents, who were very uncertain about whether this was the right thing to do. \u201cBut the answer was, \u2018If this doesn\u2019t happen, it could be taken out of your hands, and you could have your parental rights taken away,\u2019\u201d Adele told me. Because of an absence of hospital places anywhere near his home. Eddie was moved to a so-called assessment and treatment unit (ATU) in Northampton, run by St Andrew\u2019s Healthcare \u2013 as its online blurb puts it, \u201ca charity providing specialist mental healthcare for patients with some of the most challenging mental health needs in the UK\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/23/nhs-mental-health-patients-locked-in-secure-ward-rehabilitation-years\">NHS mental health patients kept on locked wards for years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adele\u2019s first phone conversation with Eddie came a couple of weeks after he was admitted. \u201cHe said: \u2018I don\u2019t like it here; they\u2019ve got lockers.\u2019 I said: \u2018That\u2019s absolutely fine \u2013 you can keep all your things there.\u2019 He said: \u2018No, Mum \u2013 the lockers are for <em>me.</em><em>\u2019</em>\u201d What he was describing was a seclusion room: \u201ca bare room, with no windows. Sometimes they put in a plastic mattress. There was no toilet in the one Eddie was in: he was given a bowl.\u201d</p> <p>His mother then made the first of countless weekly visits. \u201cEddie was brought up from downstairs as if he was a prisoner. He was so heavily sedated he couldn\u2019t lift his head up. He\u2019d put on stones of weight; he was dribbling. He was pale. He wasn\u2019t Eddie.\u201d She tells me that on all her visits she saw bruising on his body.</p> <p>Even if the more terrifying aspects of Eddie\u2019s care receded, after a spell in an NHS facility in Newcastle, he was placed in an NHS psychiatric intensive care unit (or PICU) in Salisbury, and spent six months in a so-called 136 suite, named after a section of the Mental Health Act \u2013 and what Adele calls \u201cbasically a cell\u201d. Although his standard of care has since improved, and his family are now hopeful he will soon be living near to his family home, Eddie remains sectioned.</p> <p>His is one vivid and heartbreaking story in among hundreds that form one of this country\u2019s most awful national scandals, still lacking both public attention and any convincing action from government.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>However much the language of diversity and human rights now echoes through public life, many in Britain have been left out, and remain the largely ignored victims of prejudice and abuse.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In England, there are more than <a href=\"https://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/government-faces-legal-action-over-failure-to-stop-atu-atrocities/\" title=\"\">2,000 people</a> with autism and learning disabilities in what officialspeak calls \u201cinpatient care\u201d. We now know about them, and the awful cruelties and indignities many of them are suffering, because of the much-maligned mainstream media \u2013 and in particular, the tireless work of the campaigning journalist <a href=\"http://www.ianbirrell.com/category/disability/\" title=\"\">Ian Birrell. </a>Birrell and others have highlighted not just the injustice of the way very vulnerable people are treated by local authorities, the NHS and the private contractors now woven into our public services; the scandal also speaks to something that goes even deeper. It\u2019s the fact that, however much the language of diversity and human rights now echoes through public life, many in Britain have been left out, and remain the largely ignored victims of prejudice and abuse. In different ways, people with autism and learning disabilities \u2013 two distinct categories, though about four in 10 autistic people are reckoned to <a href=\"https://www.autistica.org.uk/what-is-autism/signs-and-symptoms/learning-disability-and-autism\" title=\"\">satisfy the criteria</a> for both \u2013 are still waiting for the most basic kind of emancipation. Among the many startling facts that still does not get nearly enough attention is the fact that average life expectancy for people with learning disabilities is 15 to 20 years <a href=\"https://network.autism.org.uk/content/lower-life-expectancy-children-learning-disabilities\" title=\"\">less than</a> the population at large. </p> <p>Supposedly watershed cases of abuse inside ATUs have mounted up: 2011\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/11/winterbourne-view-learning-disability-care-providers\" title=\"\">Winterbourne View scandal</a>, and last year\u2019s case <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/22/secret-filming-whorlton-hall-bbc-panorama-abuse-of-disabled-and-autistic-patients\" title=\"\">centred on Whorlton Hall</a> in County Durham. In 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/11/connor-sparrowhawk-justice-laughing-boy-death-campaign\" title=\"\">Connor Sparrowhawk</a> \u2013 who was autistic and had learning disabilities \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/19/connor-sparrowhawk-death-nhs-care-unit-slade-house-learning-disabilities\" title=\"\">died after having an epileptic fit in a bath at Slade House</a>, an NHS-run ATU in Oxford. His family have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarasiobhan\" title=\"\">campaigned for justice ever since</a>. In late 2018, the wider story should have reached a tipping point when, even if identities and locations could not be established, Sky News <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/deaths-in-secure-hospitals-reviewed-by-government-after-sky-investigation-11546371\" title=\"\">discovered</a> via freedom of information requests that 40 people with a learning disability or autism had died in ATUs over the previous two and a half years.</p> <p>But somehow, the scandal drifted on. Last week the Equality and Human Rights Commission <a href=\"https://equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-work/news/health-secretary-faces-legal-challenge-failing-patients-learning-disabilities-and\" title=\"\">announced</a> that it was taking legal action against the government, founded on ministers\u2019 possible breaching of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/oct/03/what-is-european-convention-on-human-rights-echr\" title=\"\">European convention on human rights</a>, and the fact that it has \u201crepeatedly missed [its] targets to improve the provision of community-based care, and to decrease the number of people with learning disabilities and autism who are currently being involuntarily detained in long-term facilities against their will\u201d.</p> <p>The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, keeps <a href=\"https://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/anger-as-hancock-offers-string-of-seven-year-old-policies-on-institutional-care/\" title=\"\">promising</a> to make sizeable changes but has so far failed to deliver much at all. The relevant authorities need to release much more information about cases of abuse, let alone people who have died. Basic legal injustices urgently need to be tackled: the Mental Health Act, which defines sectioning, now contains caveats for people with learning disabilities that often count for precious little at all, while <a href=\"https://www.autism.org.uk/get-involved/campaign/mental-health-act.aspx\" title=\"\">no exceptions</a> at all are made for autism, which leaves the way open to no end of abuses. There are structural stupidities in how social care is funded: if local authorities push people into the archipelago of NHS-funded mental hospitals, it relieves pressures on their finances. In turn, facilities run by private companies can maximise the revenues they get from the NHS \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47749025\" title=\"\">estimated</a> at an average of \u00a33,000 a week per patient \u2013 by keeping people detained at huge expense for as long as possible.</p> <p>Not long after I spoke to Adele Green, I put in a call to a man called Jeremy, whose surname cannot be published. He lives in Walsall, in the West Midlands, and his campaigning on behalf of his autistic daughter, Bethany, has included defeating a gagging order attempted by his local council.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/12/scandalous-detention-learning-disabled-people-review\">The scandalous detention of learning disabled people won't be stopped by a review | Dan Scorer</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-50139692\" title=\"\">Bethany was also held in a St Andrew\u2019s Healthcare ATU</a> from the age of 15. She was kept in a seclusion room, which Jeremy describes as a \u201ccell\u201d, in which she was <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/nhs-treatment-learning-difficulties-bedlam-506638?amp\" title=\"\">fed through a hatch</a>. The first time her father visited her, he said: \u201cWe were led past rooms of distressed people: you go down all these corridors, and at the end is a plastic window with your child behind it.\u201d She has since begun anew in a supported living facility near Liverpool.</p> <p>When I contacted St Andrew\u2019s Healthcare for a response to Bethany and Eddie\u2019s cases, a spokesman sent me an email in which he insisted that seclusion \u201cis only ever used as a last resort\u201d; that the criteria for treating someone in this way \u201cfollows the Mental Health Act code of practice guidelines\u201d; and \u201cwe are committed to using seclusion for the shortest time possible\u201d.

He was so heavily sedated he couldn\u2019t lift his head up. He\u2019d put on stones of weight; he was dribbling. He was pale. He wasn\u2019t Eddie.\u201d She tells me that on all her visits she saw bruising on his body. Even if the more terrifying aspects of Eddie\u2019s care receded, after a spell in an NHS facility in Newcastle, he was placed in an NHS psychiatric intensive care unit (or PICU) in Salisbury, and spent six months in a so-called 136 suite, named after a section of the Mental Health Act \u2013 and what Adele calls \u201cbasically a cell\u201d. Although his standard of care has since improved, and his family are now hopeful he will soon be living near to his family home, Eddie remains sectioned. His is one vivid and heartbreaking story in among hundreds that form one of this country\u2019s most awful national scandals, still lacking both public attention and any convincing action from government. In England, there are more than 2,000 people with autism and learning disabilities in what officialspeak calls \u201cinpatient care\u201d. We now know about them, and the awful cruelties and indignities many of them are suffering, because of the much-maligned mainstream media \u2013 and in particular, the tireless work of the campaigning journalist Ian Birrell. Birrell and others have highlighted not just the injustice of the way very vulnerable people are treated by local authorities, the NHS and the private contractors now woven into our public services; the scandal also speaks to something that goes even deeper. It\u2019s the fact that, however much the language of diversity and human rights now echoes through public life, many in Britain have been left out, and remain the largely ignored victims of prejudice and abuse. In different ways, people with autism and learning disabilities \u2013 two distinct categories, though about four in 10 autistic people are reckoned to satisfy the criteria for both \u2013 are still waiting for the most basic kind of emancipation. Among the many startling facts that still does not get nearly enough attention is the fact that average life expectancy for people with learning disabilities is 15 to 20 years less than the population at large. Supposedly watershed cases of abuse inside ATUs have mounted up: 2011\u2019s Winterbourne View scandal, and last year\u2019s case centred on Whorlton Hall in County Durham. In 2013, Connor Sparrowhawk \u2013 who was autistic and had learning disabilities \u2013 died after having an epileptic fit in a bath at Slade House, an NHS-run ATU in Oxford. His family have campaigned for justice ever since. In late 2018, the wider story should have reached a tipping point when, even if identities and locations could not be established, Sky News discovered via freedom of information requests that 40 people with a learning disability or autism had died in ATUs over the previous two and a half years. But somehow, the scandal drifted on. Last week the Equality and Human Rights Commission announced that it was taking legal action against the government, founded on ministers\u2019 possible breaching of the European convention on human rights, and the fact that it has \u201crepeatedly missed [its] targets to improve the provision of community-based care, and to decrease the number of people with learning disabilities and autism who are currently being involuntarily detained in long-term facilities against their will\u201d. The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, keeps promising to make sizeable changes but has so far failed to deliver much at all. The relevant authorities need to release much more information about cases of abuse, let alone people who have died. Basic legal injustices urgently need to be tackled: the Mental Health Act, which defines sectioning, now contains caveats for people with learning disabilities that often count for precious little at all, while no exceptions at all are made for autism, which leaves the way open to no end of abuses. There are structural stupidities in how social care is funded: if local authorities push people into the archipelago of NHS-funded mental hospitals, it relieves pressures on their finances. In turn, facilities run by private companies can maximise the revenues they get from the NHS \u2013 estimated at an average of \u00a33,000 a week per patient \u2013 by keeping people detained at huge expense for as long as possible. Not long after I spoke to Adele Green, I put in a call to a man called Jeremy, whose surname cannot be published. He lives in Walsall, in the West Midlands, and his campaigning on behalf of his autistic daughter, Bethany, has included defeating a gagging order attempted by his local council. Bethany was also held in a St Andrew\u2019s Healthcare ATU from the age of 15. She was kept in a seclusion room, which Jeremy describes as a \u201ccell\u201d, in which she was fed through a hatch. The first time her father visited her, he said: \u201cWe were led past rooms of distressed people: you go down all these corridors, and at the end is a plastic window with your child behind it.\u201d She has since begun anew in a supported living facility near Liverpool. When I contacted St Andrew\u2019s Healthcare for a response to Bethany and Eddie\u2019s cases, a spokesman sent me an email in which he insisted that seclusion \u201cis only ever used as a last resort\u201d; that the criteria for treating someone in this way \u201cfollows the Mental Health Act code of practice guidelines\u201d; and \u201cwe are committed to using seclusion for the shortest time possible\u201d. Bethany\u2019s experience of it lasted nearly two years. Jeremy recalls that on his first visit to the St Andrew\u2019s unit \u201cthe staff member we met was crying, saying: \u2018This should not be happening.\u2019 But that turned into: \u2018This is how we are going to care for Beth.\u2019\u201d Clearly the verb used in that sentence was wrong: like so many people, Bethany was the victim of a regime based not on care but on something akin to torture, and a wider system that should have long since been the subject of a huge national reckoning. The fact that it is still in place should shame us all. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>James Taylor looks out at the sprawling London skyline. \u201cThis is where it started,\u201d he says. \u201cThe moment.\u201d He made his first trip here in 1968, playing for Paul McCartney and George Harrison and becoming the first artist signed to the Beatles\u2019 record label, Apple Records. This was before he moved to Laurel Canyon with the rest of the denim-draped California dreamers who defined the sound of the late 60s and far beyond. Before he met David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, Carole King and Joni Mitchell. Before he and Mitchell fell in love. Before he wrote his pivotal album Sweet Baby James during a stint in a psychiatric hospital. Before his marriage to Carly Simon, which opened up his personal life \u2013 including his long battle with heroin addiction \u2013 to public consciousness. Before he sold 100m records, performed for the Obamas and the Clintons, and then, decades later, appeared on stage with one of the world\u2019s biggest pop stars, Taylor Swift, who is named after him.</p> <p>It has been quite the trip, he admits.</p> <p>Taylor is in a reflective mood when we meet, and says he is always like this. \u201cI\u2019m a very self-centred songwriter. I always have been. It\u2019s the personal stuff I like, for better or for worse.\u201d He is here to promote his 19th album, American Standard; a covers album of the old standards and Broadway show tunes he was raised on. He says there was a period when his generation wanted to distance themselves from this music, but he now recognises it as \u201cthe pinnacle of American popular song ... It was sheet music, anyone would sing it, so the songs had to stand on their own. It\u2019s what informed me as a songwriter, and others of my generation; Lennon and McCartney, Randy Newman, Elton [John] and Bernie [Taupin], Paul Simon ...\u201d</p> <p>He has also released an audio memoir \u2013 Break Shot \u2013 which takes him back to his turbulent early years, finishing with that first London trip. He is anxious, he says, about how the memoir will be received. It covers his father\u2019s alcoholism and his brother\u2019s death from the disease, as well as his own drug addiction, all of which, he worries, could be sensationalised. But the memoir is mostly about the shattering effect that early childhood trauma, addiction and grief can have generations later. It\u2019s a subtle exploration of the \u201cripples\u201d, as Taylor puts it.</p> <p>Born in Boston in 1948, Taylor was, according to his memoir, \u201cbrought up devoted to progressive politics, self-improvement and the arts\u201d. His father, a doctor, moved the family to the south when he became the dean of the medical school of the University of North Carolina; his mother didn\u2019t want to go, and fought against the politics she found there. She saw the north-eastern state of Massachusetts as a \u201clost Eden\u201d and would spend her days doing sit-ins at segregated lunch counters, on protests, and hauling her five kids to Martha\u2019s Vineyard every summer to \u201crestore our Yankee credentials\u201d. Not long after moving the family to North Carolina, Taylor\u2019s father was assigned to the navy. He spent two years on an expedition to the south pole, where he held the keys to the liquor cabinet of 100 men. He went to the bottom of the world and returned with a serious drinking problem.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a mysterious energy to someone who lives with a tragedy like this,\u201d Taylor says of his father. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you take your report card home from school and you know that if you hand it to him before he\u2019s had his first drink, you\u2019re going to get one response and if you hand it to him after his first drink, you\u2019ll get another.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bedbb337a70a264ad4e703432f7ea785ef02a30e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bedbb337a70a264ad4e703432f7ea785ef02a30e/0_0_4096_2802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor being awarded the presidential medal of freedom by President Obama in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor being awarded the presidential medal of freedom by President Obama in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was his dad abusive? \u201cNo,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cMy father was a remarkable and powerful and beautiful guy who self-medicated with alcohol ... But he was by no means an abusive or stumble-bum or knee-walking or ditch-sleeping drunk.\u201d</p> <p>Still, an unpredictable parent is rarely a recipe for a stable adulthood. \u201cSure,\u201d he says. \u201cBut complacent happiness is not a gift of the gods, either.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor began playing guitar in his teens, strumming along to his parents\u2019 record collection: Harry Belafonte, Nina Simone, Judy Garland, Lead Belly. Fingerpicking became his vernacular as much as his lyrics. His first big hit, Fire and Rain, about the suicide of a friend, includes the themes that came to define his songwriting \u2013 the precarity of our emotional lives, happiness as something to be treasured and the natural world\u2019s capacity for renewal. The line \u201cI\u2019ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend,\u201d prompted Carole King to write You\u2019ve Got a Friend for him in response.</p> <p>It was during high school that he and his family began to unravel. He was admitted to the McLean psychiatric hospital at 16 with what we would now probably call depression and anxiety, staying there for nine months. Two of his siblings followed him there. \u201cWhen I jumped the tracks and went to McLean, it\u2019s like they thought: \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s right, we need this help.\u2019 It became an option.\u201d</p> <p>When Taylor left hospital, the fund set aside for his university tuition had been spent on his treatment and he decided to go to New York to pursue music. He formed a band, the Flying Machine, and developed a heroin habit. \u201cTo be able to take a juice that solves your internal stress ...\u201d he trails off. \u201cOne of the signs that you have an addiction problem is how well it works for you at the very beginning. It\u2019s the thing that makes you say: \u2018Damn, I like my life now.\u2019 That\u2019s when you know you shouldn\u2019t do it again.\u201d His wasn\u2019t the addiction of rock mythology, chaotic and glamourised. Taylor says mostly he used the drug to \u201cget normal\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d6c297cef6ce28a08eb88b201616fb3031d30eed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6c297cef6ce28a08eb88b201616fb3031d30eed/0_0_1425_1425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor\u2019s breakout second album, Sweet Baby James.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor\u2019s breakout second album, Sweet Baby James.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One day, his father called him in New York. \u201cHe said: \u2018James, you don\u2019t sound too good.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Taylor was strung out, broke and still very unwell. His dad drove through the night, arriving at his West Side apartment the next day. \u201cIt\u2019s a cynical thing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut, you know, a mother really has to be there. But a father? Well, you can construct a father out of a few good episodes.\u201d It was on that long drive home that his father warned him opiates were like kryptonite to the Taylors. \u201cAs a kid, his uncle said to him: \u2018If you\u2019re a Taylor and you touch an opiate, you\u2019re finished. You can just kiss your entire life goodbye.\u2019\u201d His father\u2019s family had owned a sanatorium, the Broadoaks asylum in Morganton, North Carolina. \u201cAfter the civil war, there was a huge opiate problem. A lot of the business in the sanatorium was treating addiction \u2013 a lot of mental health problems were secretly addiction problems,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Taylor boarded a flight to London shortly after New Year\u2019s Day 1968. His friend had given him the number of Peter Asher, the brother of McCartney\u2019s then girlfriend Jane Asher; he had just been hired as a talent scout for the Beatles\u2019 new label. Asher liked Taylor\u2019s demo and arranged an audition with McCartney and Harrison. \u201cI was very nervous. But I was also, you know, on fire,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIn my sort of mellow, sensitive way.\u201d He played his song Something In the Way She Moves (a line Harrison pinched for the opening line of his song Something) and they signed him then and there to make his eponymous first album. At the time, the Beatles were making the White Album. \u201cWe intersected in the studio a lot,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cThey were leaving as I was coming in. I often came in early and would sit in the control room and listen to them recording \u2013 and hear playbacks of what they had just cut.\u201d Did you hang out together? \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. I ask if the band was unravelling by that point. \u201cWell, it was a slow unraveling, but it was also an extremely creative unravelling.\u201d</p> <p>Heroin and other opiates were very available and very cheap in London at the time. \u201cI picked up pretty soon after I got here,\u201d he says. \u201cI started by \u2026\u201d he pauses. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t go into this kind of stuff. It\u2019s not an AA meeting.\u201d Then he continues. \u201cBut you used to be able to buy something called Collis Browne\u2019s Chlorodyne, which was an old-fashioned medication. Essentially, it was a tincture of opium, so you\u2019d drink a couple of bottles and you could take the edge off.\u201d Was it hard to kick the habit, given the circles he was moving in? \u201cWell, I was a bad influence to be around the Beatles at that time, too.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause I gave John opiates.\u201d Did you introduce him to them? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. Lennon, by many accounts, picked up a heroin habit in 1968 that contributed to an unhealable rift in the band.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1412ff1d1df29decf6abc72e51e40cf88962b2a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1412ff1d1df29decf6abc72e51e40cf88962b2a6/0_46_1861_1416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carly Simon and Taylor at home in New York in 1972.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carly Simon and Taylor at home in New York in 1972.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Newsday LLC/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A year later, after being released from his Apple contract, Taylor went to a rehab facility and moved to Laurel Canyon in Los Angeles, a deep-green crease that runs through the Hollywood Hills \u2013 which was becoming a haven for the young, politically aware and creative. It was, he says, a rare instance where something heralded as a golden age really was one. A new generation of singer-songwriters came up through the Troubadour nightclub, their work focusing on the internal and domestic, and borrowing from the roots of American song: country, bluegrass, folk.</p> <p>\u201cIt really was a perfect moment, that Laurel Canyon period,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cCarole lived up there, Joni and I lived in her house there for the better part of a year. The record companies were relatively benign and there were people in them who cared about the music and the artists \u2013 it hadn\u2019t become a corporate monolith yet. There was a sense of there being a community: myself, Jackson Browne, Joni Mitchell, Carole King, Crosby, Stills and Nash. David Geffen was in the mix a lot. Linda Ronstadt, Peter Asher, Harry Nilsson. You know, it was pretty much what they say. Things really worked well.\u201d</p> <p>While in rehab, he had written most of the songs for his second album, his breakout, Sweet Baby James. He enlisted King to play keyboard; he then played on her 1971 album Tapestry. His relationship with Mitchell lasted a year, much of it on the road: she was composing the songs for her classic album Blue \u2013 he, meanwhile, was writing his third album, Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon, including the gorgeous You Can Close Your Eyes, written for her. But behind the scenes, their relationship was struggling. As Taylor\u2019s career took off, his addiction dragged him down again. Mitchell mourned their split on her album For the Roses in the song Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire, a devastating eyewitness account of a person \u201cbashing in veins for peace\u201d. I ask Taylor if he is able to listen to Mitchell\u2019s music from that time. \u201cBlue, oh yes,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd she sings so beautifully on my songs.\u201d What about Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire? He goes quiet. \u201cIt\u2019s not like listening to me,\u201d he whispers.</p> <p>What is it like? He hangs his head for some time, silent. \u201cI\u2019m not able to listen to it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I ask if he\u2019s still in touch with Mitchell and his face lights up for the first time. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to have a friendship and, well, I recently sort of re-engaged with Joni, and that\u2019s been wonderful. She came to a show of mine recently, at the Hollywood Bowl, which was an unusual thing for her to do.\u201d Mitchell has been recovering from a period of ill health after a brain aneurysm in 2015. \u201cBut she\u2019s recovering, she\u2019s coming back \u2013 which is an amazing thing to be able to do \u2013 and I wonder what she has to tell us about that.\u201d When you say \u201ccoming back\u201d does he mean she\u2019s making music? \u201cYes, I think she\u2019s coming back musically ... It\u2019s amazing to see her come back to the surface.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fcc65084aa342c2d20cdd1ea6eb8f861909f605c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcc65084aa342c2d20cdd1ea6eb8f861909f605c/53_341_3398_2038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor performing at a campaign event in 2016 for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in North Carolina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor performing at a campaign event in 2016 for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in North Carolina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sara D Davis/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Taylor has four children: two with his first wife, Carly Simon, whom he married in 1972. And two with his third wife, Kim Smedvig, whom he married in 2001. Given the experience with his own dad, is he critical of himself as a father? \u201cGod, yes, definitely,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, my kids actually say to me: \u2018You\u2019re not your dad, you know? You can relax. You\u2019re in no danger of repeating it again. For one thing, you\u2019re sober, and for another thing you\u2019re here and paying attention.\u2019\u201d He was 26 when he married Simon, who was four years his senior. He talks about their marriage very rarely. But she devoted most of her 2015 memoir to unpicking it. \u201cI was very young,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I would be an addict for another 10 years. I mean, you marry an addict, you just have no idea who this person is, and he doesn\u2019t have any idea who he is either. It\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p> <p>In 1983, Taylor got sober, attending AA. But it is an ongoing process, getting clean. He took methadone to address his heroin usage, and that became a \u201cpowerful addiction\u201d in itself. \u201cIt really lives in your bones; I mean, it just takes for ever to get over it.\u201d It helped to see addiction as a \u201cphysical disease\u201d, too. \u201cYou\u2019ve trained your body to accept a substance when you feel stress, but that help doesn\u2019t last for ever. It has a negative progression. That\u2019s the only reason people get better. And so you\u2019re left with a feeling that when you encounter stress, you feel it physically, and it feels like withdrawing. It\u2019s a nasty way to feel. And the only advice I give to people who are recovering from addiction is that physical exercise is the only antidote to feeling like you can\u2019t stand being in your own skin.\u201d Is that how it feels? \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t want to be here,\u201d he says, motioning to his body. \u201cBut in here is where you live.\u201d For 15 years, Taylor exercised for hours every day: running and rowing. \u201cIt set me free,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He hopes this year to perform to help get out the vote ahead of the US presidential election. He met Donald Trump once, \u201cin an airport. I just thought of him as a frivolous, minor player. It drives me crazy how unworthy he is of our attention and how much of it he has.\u201d He is rooting for the Democratic candidates Deval Patrick and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 both from Massachusetts, where he now lives. \u201cBut at this point, I\u2019d be happy to see pretty much anyone in \u2013 the bar is so low. Because the very worst person possible that you could think to be heading the thing is there. It\u2019s like the Confederacy has won the civil war.\u201d</p> <p>As the interview ends, Taylor gets up and shakes my hand. I thank him for his honesty, and tell him his experiences \u2013 and the thoughtful way he talks about recovery \u2013 are doubtless helpful to other addicts. He leaves the room, comes back and shakes my hand again. Then he leans in and gives me a long, warm embrace, before heading off to be photographed, walking into the light again.</p> <p><em>James Taylor\u2019s new album American Standard (Fantasy Records) is released on 28 February</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "James Taylor looks out at the sprawling London skyline. \u201cThis is where it started,\u201d he says. \u201cThe moment.\u201d He made his first trip here in 1968, playing for Paul McCartney and George Harrison and becoming the first artist signed to the Beatles\u2019 record label, Apple Records. This was before he moved to Laurel Canyon with the rest of the denim-draped California dreamers who defined the sound of the late 60s and far beyond. Before he met David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, Carole King and Joni Mitchell. Before he and Mitchell fell in love. Before he wrote his pivotal album Sweet Baby James during a stint in a psychiatric hospital. Before his marriage to Carly Simon, which opened up his personal life \u2013 including his long battle with heroin addiction \u2013 to public consciousness. Before he sold 100m records, performed for the Obamas and the Clintons, and then, decades later, appeared on stage with one of the world\u2019s biggest pop stars, Taylor Swift, who is named after him. It has been quite the trip, he admits. Taylor is in a reflective mood when we meet, and says he is always like this. \u201cI\u2019m a very self-centred songwriter. I always have been. It\u2019s the personal stuff I like, for better or for worse.\u201d He is here to promote his 19th album, American Standard; a covers album of the old standards and Broadway show tunes he was raised on. He says there was a period when his generation wanted to distance themselves from this music, but he now recognises it as \u201cthe pinnacle of American popular song ... It was sheet music, anyone would sing it, so the songs had to stand on their own. It\u2019s what informed me as a songwriter, and others of my generation; Lennon and McCartney, Randy Newman, Elton [John] and Bernie [Taupin], Paul Simon ...\u201d He has also released an audio memoir \u2013 Break Shot \u2013 which takes him back to his turbulent early years, finishing with that first London trip. He is anxious, he says, about how the memoir will be received. It covers his father\u2019s alcoholism and his brother\u2019s death from the disease, as well as his own drug addiction, all of which, he worries, could be sensationalised. But the memoir is mostly about the shattering effect that early childhood trauma, addiction and grief can have generations later. It\u2019s a subtle exploration of the \u201cripples\u201d, as Taylor puts it. Born in Boston in 1948, Taylor was, according to his memoir, \u201cbrought up devoted to progressive politics, self-improvement and the arts\u201d. His father, a doctor, moved the family to the south when he became the dean of the medical school of the University of North Carolina; his mother didn\u2019t want to go, and fought against the politics she found there. She saw the north-eastern state of Massachusetts as a \u201clost Eden\u201d and would spend her days doing sit-ins at segregated lunch counters, on protests, and hauling her five kids to Martha\u2019s Vineyard every summer to \u201crestore our Yankee credentials\u201d. Not long after moving the family to North Carolina, Taylor\u2019s father was assigned to the navy. He spent two years on an expedition to the south pole, where he held the keys to the liquor cabinet of 100 men. He went to the bottom of the world and returned with a serious drinking problem. \u201cThere\u2019s a mysterious energy to someone who lives with a tragedy like this,\u201d Taylor says of his father. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you take your report card home from school and you know that if you hand it to him before he\u2019s had his first drink, you\u2019re going to get one response and if you hand it to him after his first drink, you\u2019ll get another.\u201d Was his dad abusive? \u201cNo,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cMy father was a remarkable and powerful and beautiful guy who self-medicated with alcohol ... But he was by no means an abusive or stumble-bum or knee-walking or ditch-sleeping drunk.\u201d Still, an unpredictable parent is rarely a recipe for a stable adulthood. \u201cSure,\u201d he says. \u201cBut complacent happiness is not a gift of the gods, either.\u201d Taylor began playing guitar in his teens, strumming along to his parents\u2019 record collection: Harry Belafonte, Nina Simone, Judy Garland, Lead Belly. Fingerpicking became his vernacular as much as his lyrics. His first big hit, Fire and Rain, about the suicide of a friend, includes the themes that came to define his songwriting \u2013 the precarity of our emotional lives, happiness as something to be treasured and the natural world\u2019s capacity for renewal. The line \u201cI\u2019ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend,\u201d prompted Carole King to write You\u2019ve Got a Friend for him in response. It was during high school that he and his family began to unravel. He was admitted to the McLean psychiatric hospital at 16 with what we would now probably call depression and anxiety, staying there for nine months. Two of his siblings followed him there. \u201cWhen I jumped the tracks and went to McLean, it\u2019s like they thought: \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s right, we need this help.\u2019 It became an option.\u201d When Taylor left hospital, the fund set aside for his university tuition had been spent on his treatment and he decided to go to New York to pursue music. He formed a band, the Flying Machine, and developed a heroin habit. \u201cTo be able to take a juice that solves your internal stress ...\u201d he trails off. \u201cOne of the signs that you have an addiction problem is how well it works for you at the very beginning. It\u2019s the thing that makes you say: \u2018Damn, I like my life now.\u2019 That\u2019s when you know you shouldn\u2019t do it again.\u201d His wasn\u2019t the addiction of rock mythology, chaotic and glamourised. Taylor says mostly he used the drug to \u201cget normal\u201d. One day, his father called him in New York. \u201cHe said: \u2018James, you don\u2019t sound too good.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Taylor was strung out, broke and still very unwell. His dad drove through the night, arriving at his West Side apartment the next day. \u201cIt\u2019s a cynical thing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut, you know, a mother really has to be there. But a father? Well, you can construct a father out of a few good episodes.\u201d It was on that long drive home that his father warned him opiates were like kryptonite to the Taylors. \u201cAs a kid, his uncle said to him: \u2018If you\u2019re a Taylor and you touch an opiate, you\u2019re finished. You can just kiss your entire life goodbye.\u2019\u201d His father\u2019s family had owned a sanatorium, the Broadoaks asylum in Morganton, North Carolina. \u201cAfter the civil war, there was a huge opiate problem. A lot of the business in the sanatorium was treating addiction \u2013 a lot of mental health problems were secretly addiction problems,\u201d he says. Taylor boarded a flight to London shortly after New Year\u2019s Day 1968. His friend had given him the number of Peter Asher, the brother of McCartney\u2019s then girlfriend Jane Asher; he had just been hired as a talent scout for the Beatles\u2019 new label. Asher liked Taylor\u2019s demo and arranged an audition with McCartney and Harrison. \u201cI was very nervous. But I was also, you know, on fire,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIn my sort of mellow, sensitive way.\u201d He played his song Something In the Way She Moves (a line Harrison pinched for the opening line of his song Something) and they signed him then and there to make his eponymous first album. At the time, the Beatles were making the White Album. \u201cWe intersected in the studio a lot,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cThey were leaving as I was coming in. I often came in early and would sit in the control room and listen to them recording \u2013 and hear playbacks of what they had just cut.\u201d Did you hang out together? \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. I ask if the band was unravelling by that point. \u201cWell, it was a slow unraveling, but it was also an extremely creative unravelling.\u201d Heroin and other opiates were very available and very cheap in London at the time. \u201cI picked up pretty soon after I got here,\u201d he says. \u201cI started by \u2026\u201d he pauses. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t go into this kind of stuff. It\u2019s not an AA meeting.\u201d Then he continues. \u201cBut you used to be able to buy something called Collis Browne\u2019s Chlorodyne, which was an old-fashioned medication. Essentially, it was a tincture of opium, so you\u2019d drink a couple of bottles and you could take the edge off.\u201d Was it hard to kick the habit, given the circles he was moving in? \u201cWell, I was a bad influence to be around the Beatles at that time, too.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause I gave John opiates.\u201d Did you introduce him to them? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. Lennon, by many accounts, picked up a heroin habit in 1968 that contributed to an unhealable rift in the band. A year later, after being released from his Apple contract, Taylor went to a rehab facility and moved to Laurel Canyon in Los Angeles, a deep-green crease that runs through the Hollywood Hills \u2013 which was becoming a haven for the young, politically aware and creative. It was, he says, a rare instance where something heralded as a golden age really was one. A new generation of singer-songwriters came up through the Troubadour nightclub, their work focusing on the internal and domestic, and borrowing from the roots of American song: country, bluegrass, folk. \u201cIt really was a perfect moment, that Laurel Canyon period,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cCarole lived up there, Joni and I lived in her house there for the better part of a year. The record companies were relatively benign and there were people in them who cared about the music and the artists \u2013 it hadn\u2019t become a corporate monolith yet. There was a sense of there being a community: myself, Jackson Browne, Joni Mitchell, Carole King, Crosby, Stills and Nash. David Geffen was in the mix a lot. Linda Ronstadt, Peter Asher, Harry Nilsson. You know, it was pretty much what they say. Things really worked well.\u201d While in rehab, he had written most of the songs for his second album, his breakout, Sweet Baby James. He enlisted King to play keyboard; he then played on her 1971 album Tapestry. His relationship with Mitchell lasted a year, much of it on the road: she was composing the songs for her classic album Blue \u2013 he, meanwhile, was writing his third album, Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon, including the gorgeous You Can Close Your Eyes, written for her. But behind the scenes, their relationship was struggling. As Taylor\u2019s career took off, his addiction dragged him down again. Mitchell mourned their split on her album For the Roses in the song Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire, a devastating eyewitness account of a person \u201cbashing in veins for peace\u201d. I ask Taylor if he is able to listen to Mitchell\u2019s music from that time. \u201cBlue, oh yes,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd she sings so beautifully on my songs.\u201d What about Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire? He goes quiet. \u201cIt\u2019s not like listening to me,\u201d he whispers. What is it like? He hangs his head for some time, silent. \u201cI\u2019m not able to listen to it,\u201d he says. I ask if he\u2019s still in touch with Mitchell and his face lights up for the first time. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to have a friendship and, well, I recently sort of re-engaged with Joni, and that\u2019s been wonderful. She came to a show of mine recently, at the Hollywood Bowl, which was an unusual thing for her to do.\u201d Mitchell has been recovering from a period of ill health after a brain aneurysm in 2015. \u201cBut she\u2019s recovering, she\u2019s coming back \u2013 which is an amazing thing to be able to do \u2013 and I wonder what she has to tell us about that.\u201d When you say \u201ccoming back\u201d does he mean she\u2019s making music? \u201cYes, I think she\u2019s coming back musically ... It\u2019s amazing to see her come back to the surface.\u201d Taylor has four children: two with his first wife, Carly Simon, whom he married in 1972. And two with his third wife, Kim Smedvig, whom he married in 2001. Given the experience with his own dad, is he critical of himself as a father? \u201cGod, yes, definitely,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, my kids actually say to me: \u2018You\u2019re not your dad, you know? You can relax. You\u2019re in no danger of repeating it again. For one thing, you\u2019re sober, and for another thing you\u2019re here and paying attention.\u2019\u201d He was 26 when he married Simon, who was four years his senior. He talks about their marriage very rarely. But she devoted most of her 2015 memoir to unpicking it. \u201cI was very young,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I would be an addict for another 10 years. I mean, you marry an addict, you just have no idea who this person is, and he doesn\u2019t have any idea who he is either. It\u2019s terrible.\u201d In 1983, Taylor got sober, attending AA. But it is an ongoing process, getting clean. He took methadone to address his heroin usage, and that became a \u201cpowerful addiction\u201d in itself. \u201cIt really lives in your bones; I mean, it just takes for ever to get over it.\u201d It helped to see addiction as a \u201cphysical disease\u201d, too. \u201cYou\u2019ve trained your body to accept a substance when you feel stress, but that help doesn\u2019t last for ever. It has a negative progression. That\u2019s the only reason people get better. And so you\u2019re left with a feeling that when you encounter stress, you feel it physically, and it feels like withdrawing. It\u2019s a nasty way to feel. And the only advice I give to people who are recovering from addiction is that physical exercise is the only antidote to feeling like you can\u2019t stand being in your own skin.\u201d Is that how it feels? \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t want to be here,\u201d he says, motioning to his body. \u201cBut in here is where you live.\u201d For 15 years, Taylor exercised for hours every day: running and rowing. \u201cIt set me free,\u201d he says. He hopes this year to perform to help get out the vote ahead of the US presidential election. He met Donald Trump once, \u201cin an airport. I just thought of him as a frivolous, minor player. It drives me crazy how unworthy he is of our attention and how much of it he has.\u201d He is rooting for the Democratic candidates Deval Patrick and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 both from Massachusetts, where he now lives. \u201cBut at this point, I\u2019d be happy to see pretty much anyone in \u2013 the bar is so low. Because the very worst person possible that you could think to be heading the thing is there. It\u2019s like the Confederacy has won the civil war.\u201d As the interview ends, Taylor gets up and shakes my hand. I thank him for his honesty, and tell him his experiences \u2013 and the thoughtful way he talks about recovery \u2013 are doubtless helpful to other addicts. He leaves the room, comes back and shakes my hand again. Then he leans in and gives me a long, warm embrace, before heading off to be photographed, walking into the light again.

Daniel Bailey\u2019s production has some off notes:. The drama\u2019s issues are spoken loudly; switches between worlds feel occasionally clumsy; and the chemistry between actors wavers. But there are moving moments that showcase an original and promising writer. The clash between family love and homophobic values is convincing, Teju\u2019s story is woeful, and the final vision of the married couple is utterly romantic. This is a play about love and forgiveness with a big and tender heart. \u2022 At the Bush theatre, London, until 21 March. Then at Birmingham Rep from 25 March to 9 April.",

      "bodyText": "A cartoon published in a News Corp newspaper which conveyed offensive stereotypes about Middle Eastern and asylum seeker men did not breach press standards because it was justified in the public interest, the press watchdog has ruled. The Australian Press Council investigated a cartoon by Warren Brown, published in the Daily Telegraph in February 2019 during the medevac debate, which portrayed a bearded man with a head covering, long tunic and sandals, chasing a female nurse or doctor. The man, who was drawn with pointed teeth, was chasing the fleeing woman around the then member for Wentworth Kerryn Phelps, who put up the medevac bill. The cartoon accompanied a news story about an asylum-seeking man who had been transferred to Australia for medical treatment and had been charged with allegedly touching two nurses on the buttocks. It was published during the debate over the medevac procedures, which give clinicians a greater say in medical transfers of asylum seekers, which were eventually legislated with the support of crossbenchers, Labor and the Greens. The press council accepted the newspaper\u2019s argument that the cartoon brought a real-life example of issues raised in the medevac debate to life and found there was sufficient public interest in commenting on the case. \u201cThe council notes that in isolation the cartoon would certainly convey several offensive stereotypical inferences about asylum seeker men or men from the Middle East,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever, the council accepts it was in response to the charging of the man accused of sexual assault and intimidation and in the context of the political debate taking place about medical evacuation of asylum seekers.\u201d \u201cThe council notes that even when read in this context the cartoon still conveys a level of stereotypical offence and has a prejudicial inference that the man was guilty although not yet convicted. However, the council accepts that there was sufficient public interest in commenting on the case of the man in the context of the charges against him and the political debate. \u201cThe council considers that to the extent there was substantial offence or prejudice caused it was justified in the public interest.\u201d The ruling is in line with last year\u2019s decision by the council to clear a Herald Sun cartoon that depicted Serena Williams jumping in the air and \u201cspitting the dummy\u201d after losing a match to Naomi Osaka. The News Corp cartoon by Mark Knight drew global condemnation for what many saw as a racist, sexist cartoon. Brown has argued his cartoon was a response to the awkward timing of the charges against the man which coincided with the debate over the medevac bill. \u201cWhile the medevac debate was going on, the very thing that was raising concerns \u2013 \u2018what if the medevac Bill allowed undesirables into Australia?\u2019 \u2013 may have happened,\u201d Brown said. \u201cNo doubt this case would be an untimely distraction for Kerryn Phelps. \u201cHence the cartoon \u2013 the alleged offender chasing a nurse around an exasperated Dr Phelps, saying, \u2018Do you mind not doing that until I\u2019ve got the bill passed?\u2019.\u201d Complainants said the Daily Telegraph had failed to take reasonable steps to avoid offence and prejudice in the depiction of the man by Brown. The man had \u201cpointed sharp teeth with his mouth open to suggest hunger, his hands drawn extended as claws and a lascivious facial expression while chasing a white woman implied asylum seeking or Middle Eastern men are savages and a threat to white women\u201d. Complainants also suggested the newspaper had implied Middle Eastern men should not be provided with medical intervention because they are dangerous and that asylum seekers are \u201cdirty, predators and dangerous\u201d, according to the council. But the Daily Telegraph argued that Brown\u2019s drawing was very much in the public interest and went to the very heart of public debate.",

      "bodyText": "Amal Clooney, the UK government\u2019s special envoy on media freedom, has renewed her criticism of Donald Trump as she acknowledged that her ambitious plans to combat media repression globally were being launched into a \u201cpretty bleak\u201d human rights landscape. The British-Lebanese barrister told the Guardian that simple arguments about accountability for genocide that should have been easy to win at the UN security council had fallen foul of UN division. \u201cAt the same time some of the language used about journalists by authoritarian leaders is inspired by the language that came from the US president,\u201d she said in an interview. Clooney, who has repeatedly harangued Trump for his attacks on the media, said there had also been times when she would have preferred British ministers to do more to voice their concern about press freedom when meeting autocrats such as the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. But Clooney \u2013 and the phalanx of media and human rights lawyers she has helped assemble \u2013 are far from daunted. \u201cThis is certainly not the time to give up the fight,\u201d she said. Clooney also believes that the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is personally determined to take up the proposals she unveiled this week in London alongside a panel of senior international lawyers, including the former president of the UK\u2019s supreme court David Neuberger. A statutory instrument, potentially the most important of this parliament, is expected shortly setting out precisely how the UK government will introduce targeted sanctions against individuals, including ministers, abusing human rights, such as the right to free expression. The US and Canada have already introduced such measures, and the European Union announced in December it was looking at similar proposals. The aim is to target anyone throwing journalists in jail, or shutting down the internet. Whole countries will not be targeted, but individuals, ministers, prosecutors and jailers. The chief sanction will be confiscation of assets and travel bans. It is a novel approach building on the so-called Magnitsky human rights sanctions first introduced in the US. \u201cIf world leaders are becoming more united and more innovative in finding ways to silence the press, shouldn\u2019t we as defenders of the press do the same,\u201d Clooney said. She acknowledged that the current state of global media suppression would make things difficult for the Foreign Office (FCO). Foreign governments, discovering their communications minister has been sanctioned, are hardly likely to rush to strike a trade deal with the UK. \u201cWe recognise diplomatically it could be awkward for a foreign minister in their first day in office to impose sanctions on scores of other ministers of foreign affairs due to human rights abuses,\u201d she said. Clooney\u2019s report has proposed ways to embolden ministers by protecting them from the likely diplomatic flak. Ending what has been described as \u201cthe silence of democracies\u201d over media repression was more likely, she argued, if the democracies all spoke with one voice. \u201cThere is safety in numbers, so that is why this needs international sign-up,\u201d something the FCO is seeking with its pledge on media freedom, which has been signed by more than 30 countries. Canada felt badly isolated when Saudi Arabia launched economic reprisals for Ottawa\u2019s sanctions after the killing of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The report suggested that UK ministers could be shielded from diplomatic fallout by the establishment of an independent national body that made objective recommendations on the most egregious cases of media repression. Clooney\u2019s panel now wants to look at the consular assistance diplomats give threatened journalists, the possibility of emergency visas to rescue journalists at risk, requiring countries to open trials of reporters, and improving obligations on countries to be transparent about the arrest of journalists. Reports by the high-level panel are due this year on the improper curtailment of free speech via sedition laws, overly broad hate speech laws, anti-terrorism laws and the misuse of concepts such as fake news. Time will tell how far Raab is prepared to run with this campaign. \u201cAutocrats hold dear control of the media,\u201d Clooney said \u2013 and there are many modern autocrats in the world that would resent a western country telling them to un-muzzle their media. \u201cAll I can do as a human rights lawyer is keep trying to move an issue further up the to-do list and keep pushing so where a country is wavering they are more likely to do something than not. But yes, it is a pretty bleak landscape when it comes to accountability for human rights abuses.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has slammed General Motors\u2019 decision to axe the Holden brand, accusing the US car giant of allowing the iconic Australian marque to \u201cwither away\u201d while accepting billions in taxpayer subsidies. GM announced the end of Holden on Monday, saying it would exit the \u201chighly fragmented right-hand-drive market\u201d and \u201cretire\u201d the Holden brand by 2021. The decision, three years after the company ceased production in Australia, means about 600 of the company\u2019s remaining 800-person workforce in Australia and New Zealand will lose their jobs by the end of the year. In a press conference in Melbourne on Monday, GM senior vice president Julian Blissett said the closure was \u201can issue of scale\u201d. \u201cWith the global consolidation of the automotive industry, it\u2019s becoming increasingly challenging for us to support a brand and a business that operates in just two markets,\u201d he said. \u201cIn short, GM desperately wanted a successful and sustainable Holden in both Australia and New Zealand. \u201cWe implemented a number of alternative strategies but ultimately GM has taken the decision it\u2019s unable to prioritise the significant investment required for Holden to be competitive and profitable long term.\u201d Reacting to the announcement on Monday, Morrison said he was \u201cangry\u201d about the decision, \u201clike I think many Australians would be\u201d. \u201cAustralian taxpayers put millions into this multinational company,\u201d he said. \u201cThey let the brand just wither away on their watch. Now they are leaving it behind. I think that\u2019s very disappointing, that, over many years, more than $2bn was directly provided to General Motors for the Holden operations. \u201cI think the fact they took money from Australian taxpayers for all those years just to let the Holden brand wither on their watch, I think is disappointing. \u201cI think at the end of the day it shows throwing all that taxpayer money at them \u2026 they were never going to respect that.\u201d Work at the carmaker\u2019s Port Melbourne site would be wound down by the end of June and the Lang Lang calibration facility would finish up in August, Blissett said. There are currently 185 Holden dealerships in Australia and Blissett said the company would offer a \u201cfair package\u201d of transition support for dealers and suppliers. He said the decision to exit the Australian and New Zealand market, as well as ceasing manufacture in Thailand, would cost GM \u201cnorth of $1bn\u201d. Holden shuttered its Australian manufacturing in October 2017, forcing hundreds of job losses. In December it announced that it would pull the Commodore brand from showrooms after 42 years, as well as the Astra, due to dwindling sales. Holden interim chairman and managing director, Kristian Aquilina, said the company had \u201cchased down every conceivable option\u201d to prevent the closure of the brand. \u201cWe have had multiple rounds of discussions and tried to find a way to defy gravity,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the truth and the hard truth was there\u2019s just no way to come up with a plan that would support a competitive and growing and flourishing Holden and also provide a sufficient return to our investors.\u201d GM\u2019s president, Mark Reuss, said the company had \u201cexplored a range of options to continue Holden operations\u201d but could not \u201covercome the challenges of the investments needed for the highly fragmented right-hand-drive market\u201d. \u201cAt the highest levels of our company we have the deepest respect for Holden\u2019s heritage and contribution to our company and to the countries of Australia and New Zealand,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter considering many possible options \u2013 and putting aside our personal desires to accommodate the people and the market \u2013 we came to the conclusion that we could not prioritise further investment over all other considerations we have in a rapidly changing global industry.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The federal government has provided heavily redacted documents to lawyers representing a Tamil family detained on Christmas Island, entirely blacking out details of discussions between Australian and Sri Lankan authorities on the matter. In a pre-hearing before Melbourne\u2019s federal court on Monday, lawyers representing the family, known as the Bileola family after the Queensland town where they had been living, said they had also been given a redacted document about a ministry briefing between the home affairs minister Peter Dutton and the department secretary. The documents had been received late on Sunday night but could prove \u201ccritical\u201d to the case when it is heard on Friday, lawyer Angel Aleksov said, who is representing Priya and Nades and their Australian-born daughters Kopika and Tharunicaa. Justice Mark Moshinsky agreed \u201cit does look like there has been some overenthusiasm for redaction\u201d by the government, and questioned why even the surname of someone from the department had been redacted. \u201cOf course if there are confidentiality issues they can be dealt with in a different way that doesn\u2019t require redaction,\u201d Moshinsky said. \u201cI was having a little trouble piecing who was who together because of the surnames being redacted.\u201d Moshinsky said the government should provide the non-redacted documents to Aleksov, and that the hearing would recommence at 3pm Monday if the redaction issue had not been resolved by then. It was not resolved, and when the case recommenced, Jonathan Barrington, representing the minister, requested the redacted information be protected because it related to foreign relations. Mochinsky read the unredacted documents and said he was inclined to agree, but reserved his final ruling until the hearing in case the redacted matters become relevant. The case is expected to take one day when it is heard on Friday, and there will be no cross-examination of witnesses, the court heard.",

Trade at Harvest Halls Gap, the cafe, providore and accommodation business she co-owns, has declined at a similar rate.</p> <p>But the relative lack of visitors means tourists can enjoy the region without crowds \u2013 particularly since none of its attractions were ever affected by the fires.</p> <p>\u201cNo one has stopped,\u201d says Flecknoe. \u201cNo one\u2019s closed.

      "bodyText": "At Christmas in 2019, Tourism Australia unleashed its \u201cMatesong\u201d advertising campaign, with Kylie Minogue and Adam Hills selling Britons the serenity of the antipodes as an alternative to Brexit chaos. Within a week, the ad was overshadowed by the footage from Mallacoota Beach, where thousands of vacationers huddled by the water as encroaching flames turned the skies apocalyptic red. The crisis coincided with peak holiday season, cutting off the revenue on which many towns relied. With bushfires (for the most part) extinguished, regional Victoria needs its tourists again. But it\u2019s not easy getting back to normal. Within Australia, the crisis reinforced important safety messages. An entire generation learned to check Fire Danger Ratings on the Emergency Victoria website, to download the VicEmergency app and save the VicEmergency number, to read National Parks and Wildlife bulletins, and other (still relevant) lessons. Yet the experience also left some urbanites imagining the bush as either too dangerous or too devastated to visit. Guardian Australia spoke to people in three different rural areas about the process of recovery \u2013 and why there\u2019s never been a better time to explore regional Victoria. East Gippsland \u201cMost of what was lost was people\u2019s houses. So, for individuals, it\u2019s been absolutely devastating,\u201d says Mallacoota resident Jodie York. \u201cBut the main infrastructure around the actual town centre and all our services remain intact. All the businesses other than the abalone co-op remain active and very much in need of people to visit.\u201d After being evacuated on 30 December, York contemplated cancelling the Wild Harvest Seafood Festival, a showcase of local produce she\u2019d scheduled for early April. But she decided the event was now more important than ever, as the town fought to re-establish itself. On social media, the Empty Esky campaign encourages city-dwellers to visit fire-affected towns to stock up on local produce. But Mallacoota\u2019s isolation can dissuade such weekend visitors. Hence the My Mallacoota Esky initiative of Vanessa Janns, launched on 16 February, that allows foodies to shop online for curated baskets of regional delights. Janns lost one of her Airbnb properties to fire and saw a second severely damaged. \u201cI was pretty bummed about my business, but I could see that the other businesses in town were struggling, too. So this is just something to help their economies and keep them going.\u201d Janet Burton from Business and Tourism East Gippsland agrees that the locals could definitely do with a hand. \u201cFor businesses in East Gippsland, they make money four months of the year, they lose money four months of the year and they break even four months of the year.

It\u2019s really amazing to watch how quickly the bush is regenerating itself.\u201d The Grampians \u201cSo I probably noticed it towards the end of December. On both businesses, the bookings slowed right down, and then towards the first and second week of January, the cancellations then started to come in as well,\u201d says Justine Hide who runs Grampians Helicopters and Grampians Wine Tours, hundreds of kilometres from the December and January fire fronts. But, like others in the region, she still took a hit. Smoke from Adelaide and other distant blazes grounded flights for 10 days. More importantly, overseas tourists simply cancelled their holidays, messaging to say they thought the whole country was too dangerous. \u201cWe would email back saying that our area is not affected \u2013 in fact, I think the closest fire to us was nearly 600km away. They were aware of that, but they were still not prepared to travel.\u201d Marc Sleeman from Grampians Tourism, a body covering Horsham, the Grampians and Ararat, says that 75% of surveyed businesses have reported declining revenues, down 20-30% on previous Christmas periods. Carly Flecknoe, the director of the Grampians Music Festival, reports the same trend in ticket sales, tracking at 40% of projections. Trade at Harvest Halls Gap, the cafe, providore and accommodation business she co-owns, has declined at a similar rate. But the relative lack of visitors means tourists can enjoy the region without crowds \u2013 particularly since none of its attractions were ever affected by the fires. \u201cNo one has stopped,\u201d says Flecknoe. \u201cNo one\u2019s closed. Every accommodation provider, every restaurant, every winery, every tour operator is still in full operation.\u201d High Country \u201cHospitality people are a different breed. We love people. And we love to welcome people back to our regions,\u201d says Natalie Pizzini, whose family runs a vineyard in the King Valley specialising in Italian varietals such as pinot grigio, arneis, prosecco, sangiovese and nebbiolo. The Pizzinis also run a cooking school and operate the Mountain View Hotel in Whitfield. Diversification has helped the clan ride out two mandatory evacuations, as the fires shook the valley both economically and psychologically. \u201cI\u2019ve been part of two different community meetings in the last week, and at each we\u2019re had 10 to 15 tour operators talk. It\u2019s been heartbreaking. We didn\u2019t even see flames but the emotional impact has been quite immense on our little communities.\u201d Tim Shaw\u2019s business, the Bright Adventure Company, depends directly on access to Mount Buffalo and surrounds for its guided outdoor experiences. He received his first booking of the year on 8 February, with the disaster entirely wiping out custom through January. \u201cAnd this is the busiest period, when we get a quarter of our income for the year. So it\u2019s not the best timing,\u201d he says laconically. But low overheads mean he can cope, especially now he can again access sites for bushwalking, rock climbing, kayaking and abseiling. \u201cIn terms of adventurous activities in the area, we are back in business!\u201d Sarah Pilgrim, from Tourism North East, also stresses resilience. Yes, she says, the fires have been devastating, with a staggering three quarters of business owners reporting losses of more than 75%. But most are now up and running again. \u201cPretty well all of Mount Buffalo is open. You can go and climb to waterfalls or swim in Lake Catani. The Great Alpine Road is now open across to Bairnsdale, between us and Gippsland.\u201d In many places, visitors might not even realise an emergency had taken place. \u201cIn the Upper Murray, Corryong and Cudgewa [they] had some terrible losses to property. But in the rest of the region, apart from the occasional small burned out patch on the side of the road, you really wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s property market is in the grip of fresh boom, according to Rightmove, with asking prices jumping by more than \u00a32,500 over the past month alone.</p> <p>The average asking price for a home rose to \u00a3309,399 in February, \u00a340 shy of its all-time record, said Rightmove. Buyers and sellers have been invigorated by renewed economic confidence, described as the \u201cBoris bounce\u201d, it added.</p> <p>Rightmove, which is Britain\u2019s biggest property portal, said it received a record 152m visits in January. Agreed sales surged by 12% compared with the same month last year.</p> <p>In its most exuberant market report since the last boom in 2014-15, Rightmove predicted price records would be broken in the spring and hesitant buyers should \u201cnow jump in\u201d.</p> <p>Because Rightmove\u2019s monthly figures are based on asking prices rather than sale prices, they are regarded by some critics as far less reliable than Land Registry data. But the figures are based on the 108,107 asking prices recorded on the site over the past month, equal to 95% of the UK market.</p> <p>They align with recent reports from Halifax and Nationwide, based on mortgage data. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/uk-house-prices-rising-property-market-halifax\">Halifax</a> said that in January Britain\u2019s house price inflation rate surged to 4.1%, the highest since February 2018, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jan/29/uk-house-price-growth-at-14-month-high-says-nationwide\">Nationwide</a> said prices rose by 1.9% over the month.</p> <p>Rightmove director, Miles Shipside, said: \u201cThere is a boom in buyer activity outstripping the rise in the number of new sellers, which we expect to lead to a series of new price records starting next month. Buyers who had been hesitating and waiting for the greater political certainty following the election outcome may be paying a higher price but they can now jump into the spring market with renewed confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Others said the \u201cBoris bounce\u201d could flag after the budget and if wrangling over EU trade negotiations saps confidence in the economy. <br><br>Lucian Cook, the head of Savills residential research, said: <em>\u201c</em>Our own agents are reporting that the vast majority of buyers remain unwilling to increase their budgets. Accordingly, our advice remains that sellers need to remain pragmatic on price, particularly given some of the uncertainty around an impending budget, the first of the new government.\u201d</p> <p>Edward Heaton, a buying agent who acts for investors at the top end of the UK market, said: \u201cI would expect any house price rises we\u2019ve seen in January to flatten by the latter part of the year, as attention will inevitably turn to \u2018deal or no deal\u2019. Trade negotiations will unavoidably affect market confidence \u2013 both in attracting foreign investors and housebuilders who rely on European materials.\u201d</p> <p>Rightmove said prices rose in the month to mid-February in every part of the UK except the East Midlands. The highest regional monthly and annual increase was recorded in Yorkshire and Humberside, where asking prices were 5.1% higher than last year, according to the website.</p> <p>London was the first area to experience a slowdown in the property market after 2016 and was hit hardest by Brexit. But some boroughs are seeing a return to strong price growth. Rightmove said prices in Camden jumped by 5.7% over the month, adding \u00a350,000 to the average \u00a31,023,489 price tag in the London borough, returning them to where they were a year ago.</p>",

Rightmove, which is Britain\u2019s biggest property portal, said it received a record 152m visits in January. Agreed sales surged by 12% compared with the same month last year. In its most exuberant market report since the last boom in 2014-15, Rightmove predicted price records would be broken in the spring and hesitant buyers should \u201cnow jump in\u201d. Because Rightmove\u2019s monthly figures are based on asking prices rather than sale prices, they are regarded by some critics as far less reliable than Land Registry data. But the figures are based on the 108,107 asking prices recorded on the site over the past month, equal to 95% of the UK market. They align with recent reports from Halifax and Nationwide, based on mortgage data. Halifax said that in January Britain\u2019s house price inflation rate surged to 4.1%, the highest since February 2018, while Nationwide said prices rose by 1.9% over the month. Rightmove director, Miles Shipside, said: \u201cThere is a boom in buyer activity outstripping the rise in the number of new sellers, which we expect to lead to a series of new price records starting next month. Buyers who had been hesitating and waiting for the greater political certainty following the election outcome may be paying a higher price but they can now jump into the spring market with renewed confidence.\u201d Others said the \u201cBoris bounce\u201d could flag after the budget and if wrangling over EU trade negotiations saps confidence in the economy. Lucian Cook, the head of Savills residential research, said: \u201cOur own agents are reporting that the vast majority of buyers remain unwilling to increase their budgets. Accordingly, our advice remains that sellers need to remain pragmatic on price, particularly given some of the uncertainty around an impending budget, the first of the new government.\u201d Edward Heaton, a buying agent who acts for investors at the top end of the UK market, said: \u201cI would expect any house price rises we\u2019ve seen in January to flatten by the latter part of the year, as attention will inevitably turn to \u2018deal or no deal\u2019. Trade negotiations will unavoidably affect market confidence \u2013 both in attracting foreign investors and housebuilders who rely on European materials.\u201d Rightmove said prices rose in the month to mid-February in every part of the UK except the East Midlands. The highest regional monthly and annual increase was recorded in Yorkshire and Humberside, where asking prices were 5.1% higher than last year, according to the website. London was the first area to experience a slowdown in the property market after 2016 and was hit hardest by Brexit. But some boroughs are seeing a return to strong price growth. Rightmove said prices in Camden jumped by 5.7% over the month, adding \u00a350,000 to the average \u00a31,023,489 price tag in the London borough, returning them to where they were a year ago.",
