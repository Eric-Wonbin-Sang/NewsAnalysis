      "bodyText": "Angela Rayner is expected to endorse Rebecca Long-Bailey for the Labour leadership in the new year, contrary to intense speculation that she might instead pursue a leadership bid of her own. A source close to the shadow education secretary told the Guardian that she had only discussed a possible deputy leadership bid with colleagues, including Long-Bailey. The source dismissed suggestions that Rayner would ever stand against or refuse to back her close friend and flatmate. There had been reports that allies were urging Rayner not to back Long Bailey\u2019s bid to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. The source said: \u201cThis speculation should be dismissed. Angela has been discussing with other Labour MPs a potential deputy leadership and is expected to make a decision early in the new year.\u201d In an article in the Guardian, Long-Bailey said she was considering running to become leader and would back a deputy leadership bid by Rayner. A report in the Times claimed that allies of Rayner had warned her not to endorse Long-Bailey. One source told the newspaper: \u201cIt\u2019s clear what Rebecca gets out of Angela\u2019s support but not clear what Angela gets out of it. She\u2019ll walk deputy either way.\u201d The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis have confirmed they will stand to become party leader. Another eight MPs say they are considering standing, including Long-Bailey, Ian Lavery, the party chairman, Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and the Wigan MP Lisa Nandy. The woman who many saw as Corbyn\u2019s strongest loyalist candidate, Laura Pidcock, lost her seat in the 12 December election. Some Corbyn supporters have expressed concern that the possibility of three leftwing candidates \u2013 Long-Bailey, Lavery and Lewis \u2013 could split the left vote and allow a centrist MP to win. But Toby Perkins, the Labour MP for Chesterfield, suggested that the left was in fact acting together to smooth Long-Bailey\u2019s path to the leadership. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by this,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s purely an attempt to convince us all that [Long-Bailey] is not a far-left choice. He [Lavery] won\u2019t really stand, she will.\u201d Corbyn has said he will stand down as leader early next year in the wake of the election defeat, in which many of the party\u2019s traditional northern English strongholds fell to the Conservatives. In a new year message released on Tuesday night, Corbyn did not mention the election defeat or his departure but instead said Labour would be \u201cthe resistance\u201d against Boris Johnson. \u201cNow we are not just entering a new year but a new decade. And the period ahead could not be more important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy. But we have built a movement. We are the resistance to Boris Johnson. \u201cWe will be campaigning every day. We will be on the frontline, both in parliament and on the streets.\u201d While the timetable for the contest has yet to been announced, it is expected to begin next month, with a new leader to be in place by the spring. To be a candidate on the ballot paper, each potential leader will need the backing of 10% of Labour MPs and MEPs. Because there are 203 MPs and 10 MEPs, they will need 22 votes. They will then have to win support from either 5% of constituency Labour parties or \u201cat least three affiliates (at least two of which shall be trade union affiliates) comprising 5% of affiliated membership\u201d. This has given both trade union general secretaries and grassroots organisations such as Jon Lansman\u2019s Momentum considerable say in who will become the next leader. Momentum has proved itself to be adept at rallying its supporters at key internal elections. There are only 12 unions affiliated to the Labour party, of which only five are big enough to take a candidate across the 5% threshold: Unite, Unison, the GMB, Usdaw and the CWU. Some in the centre of the party say that rule changes introduced in 2016 have vastly improved the odds of a leftwing successor to Corbyn. Once the ballot paper is finalised, every MP, party member and affiliated supporter \u2013 or member of a trade union or socialist society \u2013 will have one vote via post or online. Registered supporters, who paid a one-off fee to participate in a leadership election, can also vote. The contest has to take at least five weeks, according to party rules, but the actual timetable will be decided by a meeting of the party\u2019s national executive committee on 6 January.",

      "bodyText": "New York Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s decision to up the police presence in multi-ethnic neighborhoods to combat a rise in antisemitic hate crimes has received pushback from liberal Jewish groups that say the measures will further divide communities. Over the weekend, De Blasio announced several new policing measures in response to seven hate crimes in as many days, culminating with an attack in Monsey, New York, that left five members of the ultra-Orthodox community wounded after a knife-wielding assailant stormed the house of a rabbi. The measures include stepping up police patrols in neighborhoods including Borough Park, Midwood, Crown Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Williamsburg, as well as establishing community-based neighborhood safety coalitions overseen by the Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes. In addition, the city announced an increased NYPD presence at houses of worship and during local events. Six new surveillance towers and additional security cameras will be installed throughout the neighborhoods. But the announcement drew push back from some quarters mindful of the police\u2019s often troubled relationship with African American and Latino communities, especially as the additional policing is happening in neighborhoods where his predecessor\u2019s stop-and-frisk policies are recalled for being applied unjustly and along racial lines. \u201cThis is what dividing vulnerable communities looks like,\u201d said Jews for Racial &amp; Economic Justice in a tweet. \u201cInstead of investing in restorative solutions that prioritize the safety of all communities, [De Blasio] is implementing a plan that treats abuse of black and brown communities as the answer to antisemitic violence. It isn\u2019t.\u201d After an attack on a synagogue in Pittsburgh earlier this year, Jews for Racial &amp; Economic Justice took a similar stand against plans by the Trump administration to step up security around places of worship, warning that \u201cincreased police presence and security will militarize our community spaces\u201d. Other groups agreed. Jewish Voice for Peace said \u201cthe rise of antisemitic violence this past week highlights the urgent need to organize as Jews with our allies who share an expansive idea of equality and freedom\u201d but that \u201ccalls for more police and paid security\u201d were not a solution. The group continued: \u201cWe know we have to address rising white nationalist violence \u2013 against Jews, Muslims, Black people and all people of color \u2013 while not relying on the very forces detaining and locking up and killing our friends, family &amp; neighbors.\u201d David Klion, an editor of Jewish Currents, said: \u201cFlooding \u2018POC\u2019 neighborhoods with cops is going to carry real costs, potentially even fatal ones, for tens of thousands of people who have no complicity in these attacks.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of public housing dwellings in the inner suburbs of a major Australian city have been sold to make way for slick new apartments, which the government defends by building new dwellings for the needy at the city\u2019s margins. No, it\u2019s not the New South Wales Liberal-National government\u2019s sale of public housing at Sydney\u2019s Millers Point, this is happening in Canberra under the Labor-Greens government led by Andrew Barr. New figures released under freedom of information show there are now 397 fewer public housing dwellings in Braddon than in 2014, with further big reductions along the Northbourne light rail corridor in Turner (123), the inner south in Griffith (150) and Red Hill (146). Although increases were recorded in Coombs (152), Moncrieff (143) and Gungahlin (100), the Australian Capital Territory had about 200 fewer public housing units in June 2019 than in 2014. Budget papers confirm that a target for public housing stock of 11,809 was missed, with just 11,700 at the end of 2018-19. The hollowing out of inner-city public housing has been driven by a government program to replace 1,288 older properties with new homes, which concluded this year. The ACT Liberals\u2019 housing spokesman, Mark Parton, says the government has \u201csystematically taken a broom along the inner north light rail corridor \u2026 sweeping public housing tenants as far from latte-land as they possibly could\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s despicable \u2013 it reminds me of Rio [de Janeiro] in the lead-up to the Olympic games forcibly moving homeless people,\u201d Parton says. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre to think that the people who would have benefited most from the light rail \u2013 many of whom don\u2019t own a car \u2013 now won\u2019t see the benefit and instead the government is flogging off high-priced apartments to people who drive BMWs and Audis.\u201d The housing minister, Yvette Berry, says end-of-year stock numbers have fluctuated but \u201cremained relatively stable\u201d since 2000 \u201cwithout any significant investment from the federal government\u201d. Berry says the government is still committed to a \u201csalt-and-pepper\u201d approach to public housing and the concentration of up to 200 public housing dwellings at old sites did not deliver good social outcomes for tenants and the broader community. The renewal program built dwellings in relatively new suburbs \u201cwith previously little to no public housing\u201d and also delivered 200 replacement properties back into the inner north. \u201cThe government believes that public housing should be available in all parts of Canberra to give tenants a greater choice in where to live,\u201d she says. But Parton says the government \u201cworked out how they could get as much money as they could out of this\u201d and as a result not enough housing was rebuilt in the suburbs where it was demolished. Vulnerable isolated from services The ACT government raised $150m from the sale of land in the inner north alone, with new private housing expected to deliver an ongoing boost through rates and the ACT\u2019s land tax on rental properties. Stretches of prime real estate either side of Northbourne Avenue are now grassed over awaiting redevelopment; in Turner and Dickson new apartments are being built alongside abandoned public housing structures. \u201cThe biggest reason for my concern is so many of the services set up to look after the homeless or those on the edge of homelessness \u2013 tapped into by people in public housing, like the Vinnies night patrol, the early morning centre [at Canberra City Uniting Church] on Northbourne Avenue or Reclink on Ainslie Avenue \u2013 were set up there because of the high number of public housing residents,\u201d Parton says. \u201cAlthough there are still quite a high number of people there, many who desperately need a helping hand can\u2019t access them any more because they\u2019re out in the suburbs.\u201d Nicole Wiggins, the director of the early morning centre, says although some regulars who moved to Gungahlin are no longer able to attend for breakfast, concern about a decrease in numbers accessing the service \u201cdidn\u2019t pan out\u201d and demand is as great as ever. Mark Ransome, the program manager at community group Reclink, says medical, legal and mental health services are harder to access in newer suburbs. According to Sophie Trevitt, a solicitor at Canberra Community Law, which represents current and prospective public housing tenants, the results are mixed. \u201cOur clients are some of the most vulnerable members of the Canberra community \u2013 by and large, they are just desperate for somewhere to live,\u201d she says. \u201cSome were happy to be moved from ageing, dilapidated properties in the inner suburbs to newer properties further out \u2013 particularly if they were part of larger families being moved into properties with more bedrooms and space outside.\u201d In particular, Trevitt praises the ACT government\u2019s commitment to ensure all new housing is accessible to people with disabilities. \u201cHowever, public transport is not as accessible in the outer suburbs. We have clients who report feeling trapped in public housing that is infrequently serviced by buses and who cannot afford a car,\u201d she says. Berry says that throughout the renewable program, \u201cHousing ACT worked with all the relocated tenants a year before they were scheduled to move\u201d including consulting them about where they preferred to live. Tenants \u201creceived full wrap around supports including removalists and movers\u2019 services\u201d. \u201cThe majority of replacement properties delivered through the public housing renewal program have been located along public transport service routes.\u201d Hope lies with \u2018gun-shy investors\u2019 The recent changes have made only limited impact on waitlists \u2013 according to the government\u2019s own statistics it takes 151 days for a tenant to access priority housing, 625 days for high needs housing and 1,079 days \u2013 just shy of three years \u2013 for standard housing. Trevitt says the waitlist affects people like a client of hers on the high-needs list who fled domestic violence in 2018, currently sharing a double bed with her son in a sharehouse of unrelated adults, with no space to store belongings. Berry says over the next four years the ACT government will spend $600m to renew a further 1,000 homes and to grow the stock by 200 \u2013 $100m of which is new money and $500m comes from selling old housing stock. Berry describes this as \u201cthe largest investment in public housing per capita in the country\u201d. Although the last phase of renewal did not increase the number of dwellings, building fewer apartments and more detached houses resulted in 400 more bedrooms in public housing. Parton expresses scepticism that Labor will deliver an increase in public housing if re-elected in 2020, but does not promise a Liberal government will outperform Labor on that measure. Instead, Parton argues that community housing \u201cshould be playing a much bigger role\u201d because it can provide housing at a \u201cmuch lower cost than [public housing provider] ACT Housing\u201d. The Liberals will campaign heavily on a promise to freeze rates, paid by all homeowners, and land tax, paid by investors. \u201cYou can\u2019t separate the public housing crisis from the private rental market \u2013 to improve housing affordability you\u2019ve got to get gun-shy investors back to market,\u201d Parton argues, claiming the Liberals policies will give \u201cgenuine relief\u201d to renters.

The opposition\u2019s finance and industrial team, Katy Gallagher, Tony Burke and Brendan O\u2019Connor (Jim Chalmers is on leave), calculated the average full-time worker would lose $2,100 over the next four years in wage growth alone. \u201cAs Australians head into 2020 too many are burdened by stagnant wages, sky-rocketing bills and record debt,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cWages growth has been downgraded in almost every budget and budget update since the Liberals came to office. \u201cEven with these downgrades the Liberals have failed their own wages growth tests 33 times.\u201d Since Mathias Cormann\u2019s admission in March that low wage growth was \u201ca deliberate design feature of our economic architecture\u201d, intended to prevent \u201cmassive spikes in unemployment\u201d, Labor has highlighted each budget downgrade of wage growth predictions. The most recent economic forecast, released last week, slashed projected wage growth from 2.75% in the April budget, to 2.5% over the next two years, with a return to 3% not forecast until at least 2022-23. The Reserve Bank of Australia declared wage growth of 2 and 3% the \u201cnew normal\u201d, despite the relatively healthy employment and participation rates. The government has blamed circumstances outside its control, most notably repeating the phrase \u201cglobal headwinds\u201d as it attempts to navigate and sell a sluggish economy. \u201cReal wages growth, which is wages growth above inflation, is stronger than it was when Labor lost government,\u201d Cormann said in December. \u201cThe economy is facing some global economic headwinds, some domestic challenges in the context of the drought in particular, but our economy continues to grow, our wages continue to grow faster than inflation, and the growth in disposable income across Australia is the fastest it has been in more than a decade,\u201d Cormann said. The statement, timed for the end of the year, is part of Labor\u2019s new strategy of highlighting what it considers big picture issues with the government\u2019s plan, as it attempts to win back voters it lost in the 2019 election. As part of the strategy, which was laid out in the election loss review, Labor is seeking to reposition itself as strong economic managers, with Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg\u2019s management of the economy a key and repeated attack line. The government has responded by accusing Labor of \u2018talking down the economy\u2019 but was forced to downgrade its much-mooted forecast surplus from $7.1bn to $5bn in the next financial year, with a cumulative $21bn slashed from the projected surpluses over the forward estimates. That result came before the bushfire crisis, which is expected to land another hit on the government, as the emergency enters its third month.",

The people easily caricatured, the events dramatic. With the ever-loosening definition of meme, there must be a distinction drawn between the weekly churn of events \u2013 which become \u201cmemes\u201d just through constant reference and topicality \u2013 and those with staying power.</p> <p>There are some memes that sum up a person or political movement, that can colour a whole career. Highly commended in this category are: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/01/well-done-me-angus-taylor-praises-himself-as-fantastic-in-twitter-fail\">Well done Angus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DYvwhUIlGA\">Kevin Rudd getting angry at Mandarin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihd7ofrwQX0\">Julia Gillard\u2019s misogyny speech</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/insidersabc/status/932030287818584064\">Bob Katter\u2019s \u201cI ain\u2019t spending any time on it\u201d</a>, and Tony himself and his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wT9XS_TvzQ\">28 seconds of silence</a>.</p> <p>But there is something visceral about the raw onion eating that you cannot go past. It is a baffling, earth-shaking thing to witness from anyone you would know, let alone the prime minister.

      "bodyText": "It was at the Happy Dogz grooming salon, 10 minutes from Wet\u2019n\u2019Wild on the Gold Coast, 60km from Brisbane, that the two dogs, both Yorkshire terriers, were dropped off. As they were preened and patted, how could Pistol and Boo know that, within hours, they would be threatened with execution by a future deputy prime minister? Or that, in coming years, that same politician would be found to be a dual citizen, and forced to resign as National party leader after fathering a child with his former staffer? And that they, just two dogs owned by Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, would become a beloved meme, referenced by countless humans every step of the way? As the decade draws to a close, Guardian Australia has chosen some of the best Australian memes from the past 10 years. This is a non-exhaustive list, spanning politics, pop culture and extreme online shenanigans. For eligibility, a meme was considered Australian if it derived from an Australian source (film, music or event), and the list includes both memes that are globally popular (from Australian origins) and those comprehensible only to people within the country. Democracy manifest, aka succulent Chinese meal Like God or the Mekong River, it goes by many names. \u201cSucculent Chinese meal\u201d, also known as \u201cdemocracy manifest\u201d, also known as \u201cyou know your judo well\u201d is a viral YouTube video of an incredibly dramatic man being arrested in Australia. Its origins are shrouded in mystery. Its appeal is simple. Watch it below if you haven\u2019t had the pleasure. The original video identifies the man as Paul Charles Dozsa, a Hungarian-Australian chess master who was recorded by numerous newspapers in the 1980s as a prolific dine-and-dasher. It\u2019s a good story \u2013 but there is no actual evidence that the video is of Dozsa, and people who knew him say the man in the clip does not look or sound like him. The video could be someone else, a scripted skit, or it could be Dozsa. It really doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that succulent Chinese meal is perhaps the pre-eminent Australian meme of the past 10 years. It has longevity, international popularity and relevance. Uploaded in January 2009, it has echoed through the decade. Somehow, it has overlapped with news developments ranging from obscure A-League barbecue references to the extradition of Julian Assange. Succulent Chinese meal lives on, as beloved now as it was then. Tony Abbott eating an onion Politics by its very nature is notable. The people easily caricatured, the events dramatic. With the ever-loosening definition of meme, there must be a distinction drawn between the weekly churn of events \u2013 which become \u201cmemes\u201d just through constant reference and topicality \u2013 and those with staying power. There are some memes that sum up a person or political movement, that can colour a whole career. Highly commended in this category are: Well done Angus, Kevin Rudd getting angry at Mandarin, Julia Gillard\u2019s misogyny speech, Bob Katter\u2019s \u201cI ain\u2019t spending any time on it\u201d, and Tony himself and his 28 seconds of silence. But there is something visceral about the raw onion eating that you cannot go past. It is a baffling, earth-shaking thing to witness from anyone you would know, let alone the prime minister. From an incredibly worthy, crowded field it rises up like a towering mark in a grand final, a speccy on the shoulders of giants. Tony Abbott eating an onion is the political meme of the decade, bar none. The fact that he did it twice makes it otherworldly. When Abbott left the prime ministership, he told the Daily Telegraph in a heartfelt, post-mortem interview: \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have eaten an onion.\u201d We clearly do not agree. iSnack 2.0 In 2009, the makers of Vegemite decided to mix it in with cream cheese. Then they held a competition to describe what they had done. You know how this ends. The naming of iSnack 2.0 was so universally hated it was reversed after only four days. An ABC News article from the time described it as doing \u201cimmense damage\u201d to the brand (even if it was a deliberate, desperate pitch for publicity) \u2013 in what was one of the mildest, most level-headed write-ups from the era. Commercially, iSnack 2.0 was a failure. But culturally, it\u2019s a foundational moment. Looking back, iSnack 2.0 did much to popularise, and normalise, the concept of social media blowback. Launched during Twitter\u2019s infancy, iSnack 2.0 become the first demonstration of its social power, for better or worse. It may be gone, but iSnack 2.0 lives on through Boaty McBoatface (and Sydney\u2019s own Ferry McFerryface), Tom Hooper\u2019s Cats, and the live-action Sonic movie. iSnack 2.0 created \u201cthe internet reacts to\u201d template, the spectre that haunts every launch. And locally, it was a coming of age for Australian social media. The white-hot flame of iSnack 2.0 helped crystallise a unique, hyperlocal meme identity \u2013 a love of Woolies chocolate cakes, Shapes and Darryl Braithwaite\u2019s The Horses. Current meme mills (and money-spinning machines) such as Brown Cardigan or the Betoota Advocate exist now through tapping into the community that came together to kill iSnack 2.0. The hated condiment is dead, but its DNA lives on in \u201cAussie memes\u201d, modern boycott campaigns and social-media reaction articles, concepts we all now take for granted. iSnack 2.0 was the day Kraft let the genie out of the bottle, and it\u2019s never going back. Smashed avo on toast It\u2019s a sentence that will (hopefully) make no sense to anyone outside this decade. But for now, we are living in a fleeting moment where the planets have aligned and the following words are comprehensible. In 2016, the Australian\u2019s economics columnist Bernard Salt started the worldwide meme that millennials cannot afford to buy houses because of avocado on toast. When Salt first published, we thought it would be a radar blip. Such a niche intersection between Australian housing prices, Australian brunch culture and Australian media \u2013 why would anyone else care? But then it spread across the world. It was picked up by the BBC, the New York Times, the Guardian in the UK, and the same joke hangs on cafe menus from California to Barcelona. It\u2019s been discussed by congresswomen, it\u2019s become a symbol of generational warfare. Now the Wikipedia page for avocado toast includes the subheading: \u201cPolitical symbolism \u2013 further information: Middle-class squeeze\u201d. This is something so stupid it must be celebrated. Shooting stars The definition of a sleeper hit. Many people who have seen or heard Shooting Stars probably don\u2019t even realise what it is, or that it\u2019s Australian. Shooting Stars, most popular in 2017, is a meme that shows a person jumping or falling over, set to the pumping beats of 2008 minor dancefloor hit Shooting Stars by Sydney band Bag Raiders. It\u2019s the gold standard in local kid come good on the international stage, the Chris Hemsworth and Margot Robbie of meme culture. At its peak, Shooting Stars became so popular it was featured in Katy Perry\u2019s highly internet-literate video for her song Swish Swish. Just waiting for a mate A 2013 clip from Highway Patrol, where an obviously drunk man tells the police he is simply \u201cwaiting for a mate\u201d is iconic. More than any other meme on this list, it\u2019s become a staple of everyday Australian speech, achieving a \u201cNot happy, Jan!\u201d level of catchphrase-worthiness that seems to hark back to an earlier era, thought lost in the internet age. World is fukt Three words. 11 letters. Say it, and Australian media infamy is yours. In 2014, on Anzac Day morning, the Australian Financial Review went to print, an icon in the making. So littered with errors and mistakes and placeholders, it was like a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Every second, a new intricate detail bloomed. \u201cJapan headline,\u201d it said. \u201cJoe Hockey headline tk here\u201d.

And as layoffs and media concentration bit down hard in later years, \u201cWorld is fukt\u201d became a metaphor for media. Worst of all, as the decade wore on there was the sad realisation that maybe, it actually was the best, most succinct way to describe what was happening.

Pistol and Boo Their story has already partly been told. In 2015, Johnny Depp and then-partner Amber Heard arrived in Australia to film a movie. They brought their two Yorkshire terriers, Pistol and Boo, but did not declare them to Australian biosecurity. In return, Barnaby Joyce threatened the dogs with death. It was a pun bonanza for subeditors. It was the War on Terriers. When they escaped alive, it was Who let the dogs out? Programming whizzes at Guardian Australia created an interactive countdown called \u201cCountdown to Depp dog death deadline\u201d, a sentence so beautiful it deserves its own award.

As late as 2017, Joyce was somehow still telling people that he could reinvestigate Johnny Depp. And as the decade ended and Joyce himself stepped into the meme spotlight with multiple scandals, Pistol and Boo \u2013 or a happy Amber Heard \u2013 became their own meme shorthand for his troubles.

      "bodyText": "The man accused of stabbing five members of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in New York has been charged with federal hate crimes. In a criminal complaint filed by the US attorney\u2019s office for the southern district of New York on Monday, Grafton Thomas, 37, is accused of harboring extremist motivations. The complaint alleges Grafton kept diaries that contained antisemitic views, references to Adolf Hitler and \u201cNazi culture,\u201d and drawings of a Star of David and a swastika. The documents also refer to a phone found in Grafton\u2019s car that allegedly contained online searched-for phrases like \u201cWhy did Hitler hate the Jews\u201d, \u201cGerman Jewish Temples near me\u201d as well as a recent news article about New York\u2019s plan to increases police presence in vulnerable neighborhoods. Thomas pleaded not guilty to five counts of attempted murder and one count of first-degree burglary. In a statement released Sunday, his lawyer, Michael Sussman, said his client \u201chad a long history of mental illness and hospitalizations\u201d but \u201cno known history of antisemitism\u201d. The federal hate charges come as Democratic presidential candidates condemned the spate of antisemitic attacks and incidents over the holiday period. Bernie Sanders told a crowd at a menorah-lighting ceremony: \u201cIf there was ever a time when we say no to divisiveness, this is that moment.\u201d Sanders, who is Jewish and who had relatives who died in the Holocaust, made his comments after an intruder stabbed five people at a rabbi\u2019s home in Monsey, Rockland county, about 30 miles north of New York City, on Saturday night. The attack was called an act of \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d by New York governor Andrew Cuomo. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing people being stabbed yesterday in New York City because they were Jewish,\u201d Sanders told a congregation at an event in Des Moines, Iowa, to light a public menorah on the final night of Hanukah. Sanders described the latest attack, one of seven in as many days in the New York area, as part of an alarming rise in antisemitism in the United States and globally. \u201cIf there was ever a time in American history where we say no to religious bigotry, this is the time. If there was ever a time when we say no to divisiveness, this is that moment,\u201d he added, warning of a rise in tolerance against people targeted for their race, religion or identity. His remarks came hours after a separate incident in which a gunman opened fire on a church in White Settlement, Texas, killing two parishioners. As political leaders grappled with the aftermath of the Monsey attack, Thomas is reportedly being investigated in connection with an earlier stabbing of a Jewish man near a synagogue in the same area. Grafton was reportedly covered in blood when he was arrested in Harlem following the attack, and is undergoing psychiatric evaluation. Antisemitic crimes rose 22% in 2018 compared with 2017, according to NYPD figures, and have risen again in 2019. The Anti-Defamation League recorded 1,879 antisemitic incidents in 2018, including an attack on Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life synagogue that left 11 dead and six wounded. On Sunday, Donald Trump decried the attack in Monsey \u201cas horrific\u201d. \u201cWe must all come together to fight, confront, and eradicate the evil scourge of antisemitism,\u201d Trump tweeted. Other candidates in the 2020 election race were united in their responses to the attack. \u201cI\u2019m heartsick for the victims of this horrific attack. This is unfortunately just the latest of a series of antisemitic attacks in New York and New Jersey,\u201d Elizabeth Warren wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe must fight antisemitism and make clear that hateful bigotry has no place in our society.\u201d Cory Booker, a senator for New Jersey, where six people were killed in a shooting that targeted a kosher supermarket earlier this month, said: \u201cThe increasing frequency of antisemitic attacks is horrifying. We must all join to stop them in their tracks and root out the hatred and ignorance at their core.\u201d Former vice-president and 2020 contender Joe Biden offered his \u201cdeepest sympathies\u201d to the victims and their families. \u201cThe horrifying rise of antisemitism is tearing apart the fabric of our communities and the soul of this nation,\u201d Biden messaged. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stand together as a country and fight these flames of hatred.\u201d South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg said his \u201cprayers are with the victims of these horrific acts of antisemitism and hate. This cannot be tolerated.\u201d",

It was all done in the worst possible taste.</p> <p>A twinkling, self-deprecating humour revealed itself when I first talked to him back stage at the Tiger\u2019s Head pub in Catford, south London, one winter\u2019s night in 1965. The Bonzos had just played one of their earliest shows and left the stage amid clouds of smoke from illegal pyrotechnics. Musically they sounded like a retro 20s dance band. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not copying <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0UdkKH-0Es\" title=\"\">the Temperance Seven</a>,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe are murdering them.\u201d</p> <p>It was a great quote for my first story on the band in Melody Maker. But later he denied having said it: his great achievement was to blend deep-rooted musicianship and wry humour with entertaining skill.</p> <p>After the Bonzos came to an end, Neil started working with the Monty Python team, writing songs in 1973 for the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975). A sketch on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1hpx-vHBm8\" title=\"\">Eric Idle</a>\u2019s TV series Rutland Weekend Television in 1975 provided a platorm for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qf8y7v0WIE\" title=\"\">Neil\u2019s Beatles spoof, the Rutles</a>, and it was followed on BBC2 by the Innes Book of Records (1979-81).</p> <p>From 1973 onwards his musical director was John Altman, who said: \u201cHe really was a very talented guy. When you heard his songs for the Rutles, you\u2019d think \u2018This is as good as the Beatles.\u2019 George Harrison became a huge fan and was always in the studio when we were recording.\u201d He famously said he that he liked The Rutles better than he did the Beatles.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa8efeb906d5dfa295670c7fea0b3dea9490617a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa8efeb906d5dfa295670c7fea0b3dea9490617a/40_285_2908_1744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Rutles in 1978.

His father was a warrant officer in the Royal Artillery, and the family moved to Bad Harzburg, Lower Saxony, as part of the British Army of the Rhine. He went to primary school there, and after the family\u2019s return to Britain in 1955 attended Thorpe grammar school, Norwich, before enrolling at Goldsmiths College of Art, London, in 1962.</p> <p>He studied piano from the age of seven until he decided to switch to the guitar at 14. But he had bought a very cheap model: \u201cIt was such a bad instrument it was more like playing an egg slicer. So I put music aside and became more interested in painting.\u201d</p> <p>On returning to music, he played tentatively with the newly formed Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band in the canteen at the Royal College of Art, London, in 1963. The band began playing London pubs with elaborate stage shows that led to record contracts and the studio albums Gorilla (1967) and The Doughnut in Granny\u2019s Greenhouse (1968), and appearances on the TV series Do Not Adjust Your Set.</p> <p>The Beatles connection was forged when the now professional band appeared in the film The Magical Mystery Tour (1967), for which Neil wrote the gangster themed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFf8FOIYdw8\" title=\"\">Death Cab for Cutie</a>.</p> <p>Yet despite achieving cult status and pop success, the band broke up acrimoniously in 1970. Undaunted, Neil launched a productive solo career, releasing the album Lucky Planet and joining forces with the Monty Python team. In Idle\u2019s song Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, from Monty Python\u2019s Life of Brian (1979), Neil contributed the cheery whistling, and the Rutles had their own mockumentary film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vt4ejyosn4\" title=\"\">All You Need Is Cash</a> (1978).</p> <p>In the 80s Neil diversified, contributing to children\u2019s TV shows, adding voiceovers for the cartoon series The Raggy Dolls and composing music for the show and other children\u2019s series, notably Puddle Lane, The Riddles and Tumbledown Farm.</p> <p>Neil returned to the stage and embarked on tours of the UK, America, New Zealand and Japan, and in 2006 took part in a historic Bonzo Dog Band reunion concert at the Astoria, London. This was followed in 2008 by a Rutles 30th anniversary tour. In 2010 he unleashed A People\u2019s Guide to World Domination tour and was still on the road and making personal appearances until his death.</p> <p>In 1966 he married Yvonne Hilton. She survives him, along with their sons, Miles, Luke and Barney, and grandchildren, Max, Issy and Zac.</p> <p>\u2022 Neil Innes, musician and songwriter, born 9 December 1944; died 29 December 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "Amid the anarchy of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, Neil Innes, who has died unexpectedly aged 75, was a creative force, calming influence and urbane spokesman for a merry group of student satirists whose early success in the 1960s predated the world of Monty Python. Yet even Neil\u2019s patience could be exhausted when working alongside Vivian Stanshall, the group\u2019s singer, fellow composer and self-destructive comedic genius. When Vivian began reading aloud his epic saga Sir Henry at Rawlinson End one night and his speech slowed to a slurred crawl, Innes stormed off stage in a rage of frustration. There would be rows and disputes between the multitude of Bonzo Dogs over the years of breakups, reunions and career moves. The music business often proved a songwriter\u2019s legal minefield, but for Neil the Bonzos gave him his fondest memories. A singer, pianist and guitarist, Neil wrote the Bonzos\u2019 jaunty hit single I\u2019m the Urban Spaceman, produced by Paul McCartney, which peaked at No 5 in the UK charts in 1968 and won the composer an Ivor Novello award. He also coined the phrase Cool Britannia, which became a mantra for the Labour party when Tony Blair was prime minister, much to Neil\u2019s mild dismay. He thought its political use was decidedly uncool. Surrounded by explosive Bonzo chums such as Stanshall, Rodney Slater, Roger Spear, Vernon Dudley Bohay-Nowell, \u201cLegs\u201d Larry Smith and Sam Spoons, Neil emerged as the most studious and musicianly of a motley crew that the Beatles and even hard rockers Cream took to their hearts, especially when he played the world\u2019s most appalling guitar solo on the Elvis spoof Canyons of Your Mind. It was all done in the worst possible taste. A twinkling, self-deprecating humour revealed itself when I first talked to him back stage at the Tiger\u2019s Head pub in Catford, south London, one winter\u2019s night in 1965. The Bonzos had just played one of their earliest shows and left the stage amid clouds of smoke from illegal pyrotechnics. Musically they sounded like a retro 20s dance band. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not copying the Temperance Seven,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe are murdering them.\u201d It was a great quote for my first story on the band in Melody Maker. But later he denied having said it: his great achievement was to blend deep-rooted musicianship and wry humour with entertaining skill. After the Bonzos came to an end, Neil started working with the Monty Python team, writing songs in 1973 for the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975). A sketch on Eric Idle\u2019s TV series Rutland Weekend Television in 1975 provided a platorm for Neil\u2019s Beatles spoof, the Rutles, and it was followed on BBC2 by the Innes Book of Records (1979-81). From 1973 onwards his musical director was John Altman, who said: \u201cHe really was a very talented guy. When you heard his songs for the Rutles, you\u2019d think \u2018This is as good as the Beatles.\u2019 George Harrison became a huge fan and was always in the studio when we were recording.\u201d He famously said he that he liked The Rutles better than he did the Beatles.\u201d Born in Danbury, Essex, Neil was the son of Edward Innes and his wife Rita (nee Hudson), and had a brother, Iain. His father was a warrant officer in the Royal Artillery, and the family moved to Bad Harzburg, Lower Saxony, as part of the British Army of the Rhine. He went to primary school there, and after the family\u2019s return to Britain in 1955 attended Thorpe grammar school, Norwich, before enrolling at Goldsmiths College of Art, London, in 1962. He studied piano from the age of seven until he decided to switch to the guitar at 14. But he had bought a very cheap model: \u201cIt was such a bad instrument it was more like playing an egg slicer. So I put music aside and became more interested in painting.\u201d On returning to music, he played tentatively with the newly formed Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band in the canteen at the Royal College of Art, London, in 1963. The band began playing London pubs with elaborate stage shows that led to record contracts and the studio albums Gorilla (1967) and The Doughnut in Granny\u2019s Greenhouse (1968), and appearances on the TV series Do Not Adjust Your Set. The Beatles connection was forged when the now professional band appeared in the film The Magical Mystery Tour (1967), for which Neil wrote the gangster themed Death Cab for Cutie. Yet despite achieving cult status and pop success, the band broke up acrimoniously in 1970. Undaunted, Neil launched a productive solo career, releasing the album Lucky Planet and joining forces with the Monty Python team. In Idle\u2019s song Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, from Monty Python\u2019s Life of Brian (1979), Neil contributed the cheery whistling, and the Rutles had their own mockumentary film, All You Need Is Cash (1978). In the 80s Neil diversified, contributing to children\u2019s TV shows, adding voiceovers for the cartoon series The Raggy Dolls and composing music for the show and other children\u2019s series, notably Puddle Lane, The Riddles and Tumbledown Farm. Neil returned to the stage and embarked on tours of the UK, America, New Zealand and Japan, and in 2006 took part in a historic Bonzo Dog Band reunion concert at the Astoria, London. This was followed in 2008 by a Rutles 30th anniversary tour. In 2010 he unleashed A People\u2019s Guide to World Domination tour and was still on the road and making personal appearances until his death. In 1966 he married Yvonne Hilton. She survives him, along with their sons, Miles, Luke and Barney, and grandchildren, Max, Issy and Zac. \u2022 Neil Innes, musician and songwriter, born 9 December 1944; died 29 December 2019",

Dulwich College in south London and Winchester College in Hampshire turned down the gift from the philanthropist Sir Bryan Thwaites over fears that it would break equality laws. Thwaites, 96, who attended both schools and intended to leave the money in his will, wanted the scholarship to help white boys from disadvantaged backgrounds because they perform worse at school than their counterparts from other ethnic groups, according to the Times. Dr Joe Spence, master of Dulwich College, said he was grateful to the benefactors who support the college\u2019s bursary fund, but was resistant to accepting donations made with any ethnic or religious criteria. He said: \u201cBursaries are an engine of social mobility and they should be available to all who pass our entrance examinations, irrespective of their background.\u201d A spokeswoman for Winchester College said: \u201cThe trustees are clear, having consulted widely, that acceptance of a bequest of this nature would neither be in the interests of the school as a charity, nor the specific interests of those it aims to support through its work. \u201cNotwithstanding legal exceptions to the relevant legislation, the school does not see how discrimination on grounds of a boy\u2019s colour could ever be compatible with its values.\u201d The Times reported that Thwaites intended to give \u00a3400,000 to Dulwich College and \u00a3800,000 to Winchester College.

      "body": "<p>More than 6,000 children under 14 have been investigated by police for sexting offences in the past three years, including more than 300 of primary school age, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Figures disclosed by 27 police forces in England and Wales revealed 306 cases of children under 10, including some as young as four, being investigated on suspicion of taking or sharing indecent images of themselves or other minors since 2017.</p> <p>In one case, a nine-year-old boy was recorded on a police database for sending a naked selfie to a girl on Facebook Messenger. In another, a nine-year-old girl was recorded as an \u201coffender\u201d for sending images to someone on Instagram.</p> <p>They were among 6,499 cases of children under 14 investigated for such offences between 1 January 2017 and 21 August 2019, according to data disclosed to the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act.</p> <p>While the detail behind many of the investigations is unknown, a significant number are believed to involve the growing phenomenon of sexting \u2013 consensually sending and receiving explicit messages.</p> <p>Consensual sexting among teenagers has been decriminalised in some countries, including <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/courts-law/teen-sexting-is-decriminalised-between-partners-of-similar-age/news-story/3fdceb4adbd2c6028eab1f76a86ba5ab\">parts of Australia</a> and the US, but it is a crime in England and Wales under legislation introduced 41 years ago. It is illegal for anyone to take, make or share indecent images of children under the 1978 Protection of Children Act \u2013 even if the image is self-generated and shared consensually.</p> <p>The number of children coming to the attention of police for sexting has prompted alarm from academics and charities. The data showed a steep rise in police investigations around sexting, from 183 a month in 2017 to 241 so far this year.</p> <p>Prof Andy Phippen, whose research 10 years ago found that 40% of children aged 14 to 16 knew peers who engaged in sexting, said the law was \u201cutterly unfit for purpose\u201d and that it was \u201cappalling\u201d that so many children were being classified as suspects.</p> <p>\u201cThe entire debate in 1978, when this legislation was introduced, was around protecting children from child sexual exploitation and now it\u2019s being used to prosecute children,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-26T15:09:30/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic 1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-26T15:09:30/embed.html\">Graphic 1</a> </figure>  <p>Among the 306 investigations into children aged nine and under, 17 were aged six, nine were five years old and four were just four years old. These 306 children were classified as suspects on police databases despite being under the age of criminal responsibility, meaning no action could be taken against them.</p> <p>One case involved a nine-year-old girl who was investigated by Leicestershire police for sending a naked selfie to another child. In this case it is understood that safeguarding checks were made on the girl, yet she was still named as a suspect on the police system.</p> <p>Only 30 of 6,499 cases resulted in a charge, caution or summons for the child, with the vast majority of investigations dropped because the police decided it would not be in the public interest to take formal action \u2013 a decision usually taken when the sexting is consensual.</p> <p>Fresh <a href=\"https://www.college.police.uk/News/College-news/Documents/Police_action_in_response_to_sexting_-_briefing_(003).pdf\">guidance</a> was introduced in 2016 to address the trend of sexting, allowing police to close investigations where the messaging is considered non-abusive and there is no evidence of exploitation, grooming, profit motive, malicious intent or persistent behaviour.</p> <p>Such cases are recorded as outcome 21, which allows police to list a crime as having happened but for no formal criminal justice action to be taken. Of the 6,499 cases involving under-14s, the overwhelming majority were classed as outcome 21.</p> <p>Simon Bailey, the chief constable of Norfolk constabulary and the national police lead for child protection, said safeguarding was the primary focus of investigations into sexting.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe will not criminalise children unnecessarily and saddle them with a criminal record when the evidence suggests the sharing of images was consensual, but legislation and crime recording standards require officers to record that a crime has happened. We continue to review our response, including when to name someone as a suspect, victim or witness.\u201d</p> <p>A national policing review is under way into the ethics of recording children as suspects in certain crimes, including sexting. There is also an eagerness among some police child protection officers for a change to be made in law to create a distinction for consensual sexting, as is the case in parts of the US and Australia. Currently, all reports of \u201cyouth-produced indecent images\u201d must be recorded as a crime in line with Home Office counting rules, notwithstanding the age of the child.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-26T15:08:56/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic 2\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-26T15:08:56/embed.html\">Graphic 2</a> </figure>  <p>The legal charity Just for Kid\u2019s Law described the findings as \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d and said children were being given police records for behaviour they do not fully understand, and in circumstances in which the child should be treated as a victim not a suspect.</p> <p>Jennifer Twite, the charity\u2019s head of strategic litigation who also works as a youth justice barrister, said: \u201cPolice records should never be made for children under 10 since they are below the age of criminal responsibility and should never be criminalised.\u201d</p> <p>Children\u2019s lawyers and academics argue that even when an investigation does not result in a charge or caution it could still be disclosed to future employers under an enhanced DBS check. The decision about whether to disclose non-conviction information is taken by a senior police officer in each force.</p> <p>However, the police insist that cases that do not result in formal action will almost never be disclosed and would only be disclosed if there was a pattern of repeat offending or other aggravating factors.</p> <p>Bailey said: \u201cChief constables have discretion over what is released during an enhanced background check and if this was an isolated incident without aggravating factors the chance of disclosure is extremely low and highly unlikely.\u201d</p>",

They were among 6,499 cases of children under 14 investigated for such offences between 1 January 2017 and 21 August 2019, according to data disclosed to the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act. While the detail behind many of the investigations is unknown, a significant number are believed to involve the growing phenomenon of sexting \u2013 consensually sending and receiving explicit messages. Consensual sexting among teenagers has been decriminalised in some countries, including parts of Australia and the US, but it is a crime in England and Wales under legislation introduced 41 years ago. It is illegal for anyone to take, make or share indecent images of children under the 1978 Protection of Children Act \u2013 even if the image is self-generated and shared consensually. The number of children coming to the attention of police for sexting has prompted alarm from academics and charities. The data showed a steep rise in police investigations around sexting, from 183 a month in 2017 to 241 so far this year. Prof Andy Phippen, whose research 10 years ago found that 40% of children aged 14 to 16 knew peers who engaged in sexting, said the law was \u201cutterly unfit for purpose\u201d and that it was \u201cappalling\u201d that so many children were being classified as suspects. \u201cThe entire debate in 1978, when this legislation was introduced, was around protecting children from child sexual exploitation and now it\u2019s being used to prosecute children,\u201d he said. Among the 306 investigations into children aged nine and under, 17 were aged six, nine were five years old and four were just four years old. These 306 children were classified as suspects on police databases despite being under the age of criminal responsibility, meaning no action could be taken against them. One case involved a nine-year-old girl who was investigated by Leicestershire police for sending a naked selfie to another child. In this case it is understood that safeguarding checks were made on the girl, yet she was still named as a suspect on the police system. Only 30 of 6,499 cases resulted in a charge, caution or summons for the child, with the vast majority of investigations dropped because the police decided it would not be in the public interest to take formal action \u2013 a decision usually taken when the sexting is consensual. Fresh guidance was introduced in 2016 to address the trend of sexting, allowing police to close investigations where the messaging is considered non-abusive and there is no evidence of exploitation, grooming, profit motive, malicious intent or persistent behaviour. Such cases are recorded as outcome 21, which allows police to list a crime as having happened but for no formal criminal justice action to be taken. Of the 6,499 cases involving under-14s, the overwhelming majority were classed as outcome 21. Simon Bailey, the chief constable of Norfolk constabulary and the national police lead for child protection, said safeguarding was the primary focus of investigations into sexting. He said: \u201cWe will not criminalise children unnecessarily and saddle them with a criminal record when the evidence suggests the sharing of images was consensual, but legislation and crime recording standards require officers to record that a crime has happened. We continue to review our response, including when to name someone as a suspect, victim or witness.\u201d A national policing review is under way into the ethics of recording children as suspects in certain crimes, including sexting. There is also an eagerness among some police child protection officers for a change to be made in law to create a distinction for consensual sexting, as is the case in parts of the US and Australia. Currently, all reports of \u201cyouth-produced indecent images\u201d must be recorded as a crime in line with Home Office counting rules, notwithstanding the age of the child. The legal charity Just for Kid\u2019s Law described the findings as \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d and said children were being given police records for behaviour they do not fully understand, and in circumstances in which the child should be treated as a victim not a suspect. Jennifer Twite, the charity\u2019s head of strategic litigation who also works as a youth justice barrister, said: \u201cPolice records should never be made for children under 10 since they are below the age of criminal responsibility and should never be criminalised.\u201d Children\u2019s lawyers and academics argue that even when an investigation does not result in a charge or caution it could still be disclosed to future employers under an enhanced DBS check. The decision about whether to disclose non-conviction information is taken by a senior police officer in each force. However, the police insist that cases that do not result in formal action will almost never be disclosed and would only be disclosed if there was a pattern of repeat offending or other aggravating factors. Bailey said: \u201cChief constables have discretion over what is released during an enhanced background check and if this was an isolated incident without aggravating factors the chance of disclosure is extremely low and highly unlikely.\u201d",

Critics also point out three of Rapinoe\u2019s six World Cup goals were penalties. \u201cI\u2019m not out here being like: \u2018I\u2019m the best player,\u2019\u201d Rapinoe says. \u201cI\u2019m probably not even the best player on my team, much less best player in the world but we draw the penalties and you have to score them.\u201d The forward, who becomes the fourth Guardian Footballer of the Year following Fabio Pisacane, Juan Mata and Khadija Shaw, says it was thriving under pressure in France that set USA apart. \u201cThere is no more pressure that anyone else can put on us that we haven\u2019t already put on ourselves. For us it is a catastrophe if we don\u2019t win the World Cup. We feel it all the time.\u201d Rapinoe says individual awards are \u201can honour\u201d but admits she feels uncomfortable with them. \u201cIt was such a massive team effort. I\u2019m not out here thinking I\u2019m Lionel Messi, you know? I\u2019m not at that level but to be able to couple everything together is the most important thing; we are seeing the world change around us and we\u2019re a big part of it. That feeling is almost addictive, and motivating.\u201d Sitting at breakfast in a New York hotel there is none of the arrogant air some misconstrue her confidence for. This is a more understated Rapinoe. The bright pink hair is hidden beneath a white cap and the thoughtful, humble, reflective, but still confident, person familiar to anyone who has spent any time with her is keen to philosophise about this new spotlight. \u201cEverybody has a personal responsibility to do what they can to make the world a better place in the most impactful way that they can. This is it, this is the moment and I\u2019m so aware and understand that. I\u2019m not just winning all these awards because I had a great year. It\u2019s the culmination of it all. And with that comes so many other people: it comes with the team and what we\u2019ve been able to do and the way we are organised and the way we fight together on and off the field; it comes from Colin Kaepernick, from MeToo; it comes from all of these other movements. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear I am a culminating moment of all of that\u2019s happening right now. So for me to get on the stage and just thank family and friends would be so weird. It would seem inauthentic. It\u2019s a privilege and an honour to sort of be the mouthpiece in this culminating moment. That\u2019s crazy. It is a big responsibility and I do feel a responsibility to take care of it and to give props and thanks and call out the people who could very well be in that position also.\u201d Rapinoe has no regrets over the video that went viral during the World Cup but was filmed months earlier, in which she said \u201cI\u2019m not going to the fucking White House\u201d when asked what the team would do with an invite should they taste success in France. After Donald Trump responded Rapinoe\u2019s teammates, partner Sue Bird and family were supportive. \u201cMy teammates were like: \u2018This is LOL\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they were also definitely worried about me. They were like: \u2018Are we good? Are you OK?\u2019 And I was like: \u2018Uh, yeah, I am, this is wild.\u2019 \u201cAllie Long was like: \u2018Duuuuude, this is so crazy, you\u2019re a G, you took down the president!\u2019 The whole environment was: \u2018We got you. This is our player and we just have to roll with it.\u2019 \u201cMy mom, I mean bless her, she was like: \u2018Can\u2019t you just stop? Why are you taking all this on all the damn time?\u2019 But this is what it is. It\u2019s par for the course for me, I guess.\u201d Did she ever think of distancing herself from her words? \u201cNo, never. Because it was like: \u2018I\u2019m not going and I don\u2019t want to go and these are the reasons why.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to shy away from it and I don\u2019t want to shy away from it. Ever. I think that would just give him power, give the proverbial him or they power. \u201cI just don\u2019t compartmentalise that way,\u201d she continues, after the suggestion that she could \u2018just stick to the football\u2019 to quieten things. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the experience and life for me. Even on the field: I don\u2019t go into a zone, I don\u2019t shut out; I hear the fans, I see who\u2019s in the stands, the energy is always flowing through me.\u201d She admits she cannot understand how footballers steer clear of having a say on politics and society. \u201cYou live in the world, in the city, you pay the taxes, you are affected by it all, so to think you can just be away from it is stupid,\u201d she says. In the end, her stance on Trump, and the team\u2019s on equal pay, connected them to the fans in a way she could not have envisaged. \u201cI feel like this World Cup really touched people\u2019s lives. There was this sense that we all won, like it was something bigger. People have these really emotional connections and experiences with the World Cup. \u201cSo then, when they\u2019re coming up to me, it\u2019s not like: \u2018Oh, high five, awesome soccer.\u2019 It\u2019s like: \u2018Wow, your team changed the world or changed my life.\u2019 It\u2019s this emotional exchange, which is actually amazing.\u201d Chants of \u201cequal pay\u201d echoing around the ground after the win against the Netherlands in the final in Lyon was the peak of that connection. \u201cWhat an amazing moment of collective conscience,\u201d Rapinoe says. \u201cWhat I love about football so much is everyone\u2019s in it together.\u201d It is a chorus that has travelled, and the forward gets emotional talking about the impact back home, including at Burlington high school, where teenagers have raised tens of thousands of pounds from selling \u201cequal pay\u201d shirts and pledged to donate the profits to girls\u2019 soccer programmes. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what equal pay was, or how to say it, or what any of these things were at that age,\u201d Rapinoe says. \u201cSo to be able to educate kids and arm kids with that at such a young age and to see the broader impact we\u2019re having \u2026 the reward coming back is 100 fold.\u201d Rapinoe was thrust into the role of ally in a big way when she took a knee in solidarity with Kaepernick three years ago and the backlash was grim. \u201cPeople were mad, big mad,\u201d she says. Her waitress mother in the Republican, conservative Californian city of Redding bore some of the brunt. The photos of her daughter were removed from the walls of her workplace as people complained to management and were rude to her about her daughter. \u201cIt would have been better if I was there,\u201d Rapinoe says. \u201cThen they could just direct it at me.\u201d Two years later Rapinoe helped raise huge sums for those affected by the fire that ripped through the area. \u201cAll my family live there, I grew up there, I love it there. We obviously have different views but that\u2019s OK. I don\u2019t really care if you voted for Trump; if your house has burned down, you still need a place to live.\u201d Her clothing business with her twin sister struggled after she took a knee. Now, though, she feels there has been a shift in public perception of her decision to back Kaepernick. \u201cPeople are starting to see it\u2019s part of this bigger thing. It\u2019s all the same thing. You can\u2019t be cool and supportive of me being gay and not cool with the kneeling. Or cool with the equal pay but not with the lawsuit or whatever.\u201d Having been named Glamour magazine\u2019s woman of the year she used her speech to highlight the privilege she is afforded as a white woman speaking out while Kaepernick remains unsigned. \u201cBeing white is part of the reason why it\u2019s culminating with me. The system is alive and well, so I think it\u2019s important to just say that. It\u2019s not my fault I\u2019m benefiting but I am, so it\u2019s my responsibility to acknowledge that and to try to dismantle that system. I think it\u2019s really important to say those words, say \u2018white privilege\u2019, acknowledge the fact it\u2019s happening.\u201d Talking politics comes naturally now but that was not always the case, even though Rapinoe was brought up to care for and stand up for people, and to use her voice. Football gave her opportunities that fed her social conscience and essentially saved her from treading a road similar to that of the brother she idolised and who introduced her to the game. \u201cMy brother is a drug addict and has been in the criminal justice system since he was 15. He\u2019s still in it, basically, at almost 40 years old. He\u2019s out now but he\u2019s still a part of the system and it was kind of realising he probably just needed drug treatment but instead got prison that showed me there\u2019s greater consequences to everything.\u201d It is this compassion as well as her hope for a similar attitude from the rest of society that makes Rapinoe so worthy of her various crowns, including the Guardian\u2019s.",

      "bodyText": "The global toll of dengue fever is becoming well known, with rising temperatures contributing to severe outbreaks that made 2019 the worst year on record for the disease. In 1970 only nine countries faced severe dengue outbreaks. But the disease, which is spread by mosquitoes that can only survive in warm temperatures, is now seen in more than 100 countries. There are thought to be 390m infections each year More than a million of those cases were in south-east Asia, hitting the poorest households hard and stretching health services. The epidemic is exacerbated by poor infrastructure and lack of access to healthcare, with struggling health services overwhelmed by outbreaks. Families at Angkor hospital for children in Siem Reap in north-west Cambodia Dengue is episodic, but even accounting for natural dips and rises 2019 was deadly. In the Philippines, there have been more than 1,000 deaths and 403,000 cases were reported this year \u2013 a 98% increase on 2018. In Thailand 110 people died from dengue between January and October, with 106,000 cases reported. For the same period last year there were just 50,000. From Bangladesh to Singapore, hospitals have struggled to cope with the unusually high number of patients. Since May the Angkor hospital for children in Siem Reap, north-west Cambodia, which treats more than 500 children a day free of charge, has launched several appeals for emergency donations. \u201cIn peak season, we had seven times more cases of dengue fever than last year, and half of them needed to be hospitalised,\u201d says Dr Ngoun Chanpheaktra, the director. \u201cBetween June and August, we had 200 cases a week and 30% to 50% of the beds were occupied by patients with dengue fever complications. Patients who travel long distances to visit Angkor hospital are allowed to sleep on the premises. \u201cWe have an annual budget of $6 million and as of 14 July, we had already spent $290,000 on mattresses, intravenous fluid bottles, dengue fever tests and staff overtime. If we didn\u2019t have so many mosquito diseases to manage, we could invest more in chronic diseases, intensive care and neonatal units.\u201d In a rundown suburb of Siem Reap, three members of Piseth\u2019s family contracted dengue this year. His 12-year-old son spent five days in the intensive care unit at Angkor hospital. In a desperate attempt to avoid medical fees Piseth, a tuk-tuk driver, first tried to treat his son at home. Chan Pheakdey lies in bed at Angkor Hospital for Children \u201cWhen he started having a fever, we went to the first aid centre to buy bottles of intravenous fluid,\u201d Piseth says. \u201cWe only earn $200 a month so we had to borrow $330 from a loan shark to pay for the cost of transport and IV bottles for the whole family. We didn\u2019t go to the hospital right away, because we can\u2019t lose days of work every time one of the children gets sick.\u201d Chan\u2019s mother, sister and neighbours all caught dengue fever this year, putting a huge burden on the family. Their squalid living conditions are partly to blame \u2013 the land is flood prone, there\u2019s a lack of sanitation and official neglect. To save money, Chan Pheakdey\u2019s family tried to treat him at home. The financial burden on a family can be crippling. A few hours by plane west in the Thai town of Mae Sot, surrounded by mountains on the Thai-Myanmar border, Fran\u00e7ois Nosten (above), director of the Shoklo Malaria Reasearch Unit, remembers even darker days. \u201cWhen I arrived in Mae Sot in 1984, malaria was the leading cause of death,\u201d he says. \u201cFifteen years ago, we still had 50 to 60 cases a day. Now it is one a year, thanks to an early detection campaign and a combined strategy of anti-malaria drugs and efficient community involvement. But there is no definitive global plan to eradicate dengue fever or similar diseases, particularly because the mortality rate is relatively low, so there is little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in research.\u201d This year also saw a massive outbreak of chikungunya, another mosquito-borne disease, along the Thai-Myanmar border. The strain has never been recorded in Mae Sot before and is believed to have travelled north from the deep south of Thailand on the Malay border. In Bangkok, Jaturang Wongjiragorn and his family live in a dilapidated shop-house on the edge of Chinatown and this year they felt the full force of a dengue outbreak in his neighbourhood. In September, his father went to hospital feeling sick. Following misdiagnoses at three different clinics and hospitals, which suspected flu or diabetes, he died five days later of organ failure brought on by severe dengue fever. Bangkok Metropolitan Administration inspects and fumigates an area of Chinatown After such fatal cases are reported, fumigation teams from the municipal authorities sweep in to spray affected neighbourhoods, but local authorities acknowledge that the efficiency of these short-term initiatives are limited as collective community responsibility breaks down in cities. The search for a cure From Bangkok laboratories to rural clinics along the Thai-Burmese border, there is great urgency to contain the disease. At present, palliative care is the only certain treatment for dengue. Work is ongoing globally to create a reliable vaccine. A vaccine used in the Philippines was withdrawn and banned over concerns it might not be suitable for all children. The firm conceded that the product could put some children at higher risk if they had not previously had Dengue. \u2022 Photographer Luke Duggleby and journalist Laure Siegel received agrant from the Earth Journalist Network/Internews to support the production of this story \u2022 This article was amended on 3 January 2020 to remove a description of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum as a mosquito species. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 January 2020 to clarify that a vaccine used in the Philippines was found to have put some children at risk if they had not previously had Dengue.",

Urgent action on decarbonisation was the only decent idea \u2013 indeed, the only idea \u2013 that anybody has ever had to reseed high-skilled employment in areas outside the south-east. Everything else was just buses, free ports and whining about London. The prime minister has already banned the word \u201cBrexit\u201d from his own communications, as if an omert\u00e0 will make its consequences invisible. It won\u2019t. There is a real danger that everyone but the Tories will keep it at the centre of their arguments, and it will become, by sleight of hand, everybody\u2019s fault but the people who did it. But that is not the biggest problem for Labour. The party cannot resolve its hopes into a clear and programmatic set of ideas through the fog of someone else\u2019s fantasy. It cannot make sense of its own values in the middle of someone else\u2019s culture war. Too often, Labour has resolved such crises by simply jettisoning its values in favour of electoral calculation, whose abject failure was guaranteed by that very act. It must not make the same mistake again. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

In line with a commitment in the Conservative election manifesto, Boris Johnson has inserted a provision in the bill making it illegal for the government to agree to extend the transition for a year to two (ie, until December 2021 or December 2022), even though the deal with the EU allows this.</p> <p>Many trade experts think an extension will be necessary because it will be impossible to negotiate a new trade deal with the EU before the end of 2020.<strong> Ursula von der Leyen</strong>, the new commission president, recently gently suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/27/eu-chief-questions-feasibility-of-boris-johnson-brexit-talks-time-limit\">Johnson might have to rethink his \u2018no extension\u2019 policy</a>, saying that his timetable might not be feasible. But now one of her colleagues, the trade commissioner <strong>Phil Hogan</strong>, has criticised Johnson\u2019s stance in much blunter terms.</p> <p>Hogan, who is Irish and who will oversee the UK-EU trade negotiation in his new job, told the Irish Times <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/johnson-will-abandon-pledge-on-brexit-transition-period-hogan-1.4126850\">in an interview </a>that Johnson\u2019s \u2018no extension\u2019 commitment was a \u2018stunt\u2019 and that in reality Johnson would agree to a longer transition. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the past, we saw the way the prime minister promised to die in the ditch rather than extend the deadline for <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/brexit\">Brexit</a>, only for him to do just that. I don\u2019t believe Prime Minister Johnson will die in the ditch over the timeline for the future relationship either ...</p> <p>At first sight [the clause in the bill ruling out an extension] seems very odd indeed. From our point of view it is important that we move from stunt to substance. It would be helpful if the focus was on content rather than timetables.</p> </blockquote> <p>In another jibe at Johnson, Hogan said that in the next phase of the Brexit talks Britain would have to accept that having your cake and eating it was impossible. He was referring to the phrase, first used by Johnson to sum up his approach to life in general, that became synonymous with the Brexiter belief that the UK could leave the EU but retain most of the benefits of membership. Hogan said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Too much of the debate in the UK over the past four years was based on the false notion that it is possible to make a clean-break Brexit while retaining all the benefits of EU membership. Now that the political deadlock at Westminster is broken the next phase of Brexit needs to be based on realism and hard facts.</p> <p>Any \u2018having our cake and eat it\u2019 rhetoric will not fly. Both sides need to proceed calmly and coherently.</p> </blockquote> <p>In his interview (fuller version <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/phil-hogan-a-no-deal-brexit-would-pour-salt-into-the-wounds-1.4126854\">here)</a> Hogan also restated the EU\u2019s belief that the UK would be worse off outside. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Particularly on goods the UK government has so far avoided any statement of the UK aligning with the EU on regulatory aspects. We all have to come to terms with the reality that Brexit means there will be two markets not a single market.</p> <p>We have to re-erect barriers to trade that EU membership has abolished not because we choose to do so but because the UK chooses to do so. As things stand the UK wants to leave the single market and customs union. This move still baffles me because the full consequences of that decision are still not understood in the UK. Why trade a Rolls Royce for a second-hand saloon?</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d2d972739156935b29e0a70c2280b66915284ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d2d972739156935b29e0a70c2280b66915284ff/0_52_3899_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Hogan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil Hogan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: St\u00e9phanie Lecocq/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-30T16:32:19.274Z\">at 4.32pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e0a004b8f08c39722642419\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-30T14:03:30.873Z\">2.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Labour MP <strong>Toby Perkins</strong> isn\u2019t convinced by the claims that Ian Lavery is seriously considering standing for the leadership.

I hope you all had a good Christmas. Politics Live is back today, although with parliament still in recess, and much of the UK still in holiday mode, the news agenda is looking a lot thinner than it has been recently.</p> <p>But the Labour leadership campaign has been rumbling on throughout the Christmas period. It is still at the preliminary skirmishes stage, but this morning <strong>Clive Lewis</strong>, the shadow Treasury minister and one of only two candidates who have confirmed that they are running (the other is Emily Thornberry) gave an interview to the Today programme about what went wrong for Labour at the election. He said on Brexit the party should have fought more strongly for remain. Asked if the party should have adopted an out-and-out remain position, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think what we have to understand is what Brexit was. For many of us watching Brexit unfold, Brexit was a policy of a faction of the Conservative party and the right of this country that wanted to put globalisation on steroids, if you want, and it was a hard right political project. And I believe that the Labour party had to fight that with all its vigour and to offer an alternative. </p> <p>I don\u2019t believe this was the main reason for what happened to us in the election, but I think one of the things that we have to accept is that if you pick a side, you have to then argue for that side, and argue for it comprehensively. And what we didn\u2019t do, by triangulating - one of the key USPs of Jeremy Corbyn was that he was an authentic politician, I genuinely believe that he was, but on the biggest political crisis of British modern politics we were unable, via Jeremy, to be able to take a position. I think actually we should have stood our ground and argued our case.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lewis was a member of the shadow cabinet until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/08/clive-lewis-quits-shadow-cabinet-over-brexit-bill\">he resigned in 2017</a> so that he could vote against the bill allowing the government to trigger article 50, starting the process that will lead to the UK leaving the EU.

      "bodyText": "Phil Hogan, the EU trade commissioner, has said that he expects Boris Johnson will have to break his promise not to extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020. (See 3.22pm.) Most trade experts think it will be impossible to negotiate a comprehensive UK-EU trade deal within 11 months, and Hogan was only expressing in more robust terms a view already floated by Ursula von der Leyen, the new commission president. But Johnson believes that ruling out an extension will focus minds and make a deal more likely. This is what he told MPs on this topic in his speech on the Friday before Christmas opening the second reading debate for the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. He said: There would be nothing more dangerous than extending the implementation period, in a torture that, as we all remember, came to resemble Lucy snatching away Charlie Brown\u2019s football or Prometheus chained to the Tartarian crag, his liver pecked out by an eagle and then growing back, as honourable members on both sides of the house will recall, only to be pecked out again, with the cycle repeated forever. This bill, unlike opposition members, learns the emphatic lesson of the last parliament and rejects any further delay. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, has said that the next Labour leader should be credible, competent and popular with voters. (See 11.53am.) Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business secretary, has published her opening pitch for the Labour leadership. Commentators and critics in the party have not been impressed. (See 12.37pm and 12.44pm.) Clive Lewis, a candidate for the Labour leadership, has said the party should have opposed Brexit more vigorously. (See 9.11am.) However, he has also said he does not want to re-open the Bexit issue now because \u201cwhat\u2019s done is done\u201d. (See 1.08pm.) I\u2019m done for the day too. Thanks for the comments. From Wednesday at least we will be in a decade that has a name. I might be wrong, but I get the impression that there has been less discussion than you might expect about the last 10 years as an entity, perhaps because no one could agree what it was called. \u201cThe tens\u201d never really worked as a label, just as \u201cthe noughties\u201d didn\u2019t either. But the twenties - that\u2019s a proper name for a decade. Still, it is surprising to see Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to London, suggesting (even by the use of period typeface) that he hopes they end up like the 1920s. Has he forgotten how that decade ended? Here is some Twitter comment on the Phil Hogan interview. (See 3.22pm.) From Peter Foster, the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor From Mujtaba Rahman, the Brexit specialist at the Eurasia consultancy From Stewart Jackson, the Tory Brexiter, former MP and former chief of staff to David Davis when he was Brexit secretary Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to rule out extending the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020 is a \u201cstunt\u201d that he will be forced to abandon, according to a leading figure in the European commission. When MPs return to the Commons on Tuesday next week they will resume their debate on the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill, the legislation paving the way for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. In line with a commitment in the Conservative election manifesto, Boris Johnson has inserted a provision in the bill making it illegal for the government to agree to extend the transition for a year to two (ie, until December 2021 or December 2022), even though the deal with the EU allows this. Many trade experts think an extension will be necessary because it will be impossible to negotiate a new trade deal with the EU before the end of 2020. Ursula von der Leyen, the new commission president, recently gently suggested that Johnson might have to rethink his \u2018no extension\u2019 policy, saying that his timetable might not be feasible. But now one of her colleagues, the trade commissioner Phil Hogan, has criticised Johnson\u2019s stance in much blunter terms. Hogan, who is Irish and who will oversee the UK-EU trade negotiation in his new job, told the Irish Times in an interview that Johnson\u2019s \u2018no extension\u2019 commitment was a \u2018stunt\u2019 and that in reality Johnson would agree to a longer transition. He said: In the past, we saw the way the prime minister promised to die in the ditch rather than extend the deadline for Brexit, only for him to do just that. I don\u2019t believe Prime Minister Johnson will die in the ditch over the timeline for the future relationship either ... At first sight [the clause in the bill ruling out an extension] seems very odd indeed. From our point of view it is important that we move from stunt to substance. It would be helpful if the focus was on content rather than timetables. In another jibe at Johnson, Hogan said that in the next phase of the Brexit talks Britain would have to accept that having your cake and eating it was impossible. He was referring to the phrase, first used by Johnson to sum up his approach to life in general, that became synonymous with the Brexiter belief that the UK could leave the EU but retain most of the benefits of membership. Hogan said: Too much of the debate in the UK over the past four years was based on the false notion that it is possible to make a clean-break Brexit while retaining all the benefits of EU membership. Now that the political deadlock at Westminster is broken the next phase of Brexit needs to be based on realism and hard facts. Any \u2018having our cake and eat it\u2019 rhetoric will not fly. Both sides need to proceed calmly and coherently. In his interview (fuller version here) Hogan also restated the EU\u2019s belief that the UK would be worse off outside. He said: Particularly on goods the UK government has so far avoided any statement of the UK aligning with the EU on regulatory aspects. We all have to come to terms with the reality that Brexit means there will be two markets not a single market. We have to re-erect barriers to trade that EU membership has abolished not because we choose to do so but because the UK chooses to do so. As things stand the UK wants to leave the single market and customs union. This move still baffles me because the full consequences of that decision are still not understood in the UK. Why trade a Rolls Royce for a second-hand saloon? The Labour MP Toby Perkins isn\u2019t convinced by the claims that Ian Lavery is seriously considering standing for the leadership. (See 9.11am.) It is hard to know if Perkins is right about Lavery\u2019s motives - Lavery has not been giving interviews and, even if he is just engaged in a feint, you would not expect him to say so - but Perkins is almost certainly right about the consequences of Lavery\u2019s name being in the race at the moment. In 2010, when David Miliband was running for the Labour leadership, he ended up nominating Diane Abbott, and urging his supporters to do the same, so that she could end up on the ballot. She became the first black person to contest the Labour leadership, and Miliband thought it was good to be seen to supporting diversity and pluralism. But his team later concluded that this move had backfired because, with Abbott on the ballot, Miliband was no longer about to portray his brother Ed as the most leftwing candidate in the contest. (Those were the days when being the leftwinger in a Labour leadership contest was assumed to be a drawback. Now that is not necessarily the case.) The Labour leadership candidate Clive Lewis has posted a tweet clarifying what he meant when he gave an interview to the Today programme this morning. (See 9.11am.) He said this morning that he thought the party, and Jeremy Corbyn, should have fought more strongly for remain. But that does not mean he wants to re-open the Brexit debate now, he says. He has also posted this about his agenda. I referred to Alastair Campbell as a Labour figure a few moments ago, although of course he was thrown out of the party earlier this year after he revealed he voted Lib Dem in the European elections. He has contrasted his treatment with the former Labour MP Gisela Stuart\u2019s. She said this morning she was still a party member - even though she appeared on a platform with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove during the election campaign, urging people to vote Tory to deliver Brexit. Campbell, a hate figure for some in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s circle because of his work for Tony Blair, has long argued that the decision to expel him was vindictive and unfair. And here is some comment on Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s article from Labour figures - although not ones from her wing of the party. From Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications director From the former Labour MP David Clelland From Sunder Katwala, the director of the British Future thinktank, and a former Fabian Society general secretary Katwala has posted a whole thread about the notion of progressive patriotism. You can read the whole thing if you click on the tweet above. From Damian McBride, Gordon Brown\u2019s former communications chief who now advises Emily Thornberry Here is a round-up of what some journalists, commentators and academics are saying about Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s article for the Guardian today containing her pitch for the Labour leadership. It is a relatively random sample because many of the usual suspects are (sensibly) still in holiday mode and staying off Twitter. From my colleague Zoe Williams From openDemocracy\u2019s Peter Geoghegan From the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul There is more. If you click on one of those tweets, you should be able to read the thread. Here is his conclusion. From HuffPost\u2019s Rachel Wearmouth From the blogger and commentator Kevin Meagher From the author and former Guardian journalist David Walker From the politics professor Steven Fielding From the politics professor Richard Wyn Jones From the politics professor Matthew Goodwin Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has been tweeting this morning - but without saying anything about her campaign for the Labour deputy leadership that Rebecca Long-Bailey endorsed even though it has not been announced. (See 11.07am.) Jeremy Corbyn is still leader of the Labour party. But in his Today interview this morning Clive Lewis was speaking about him in the past tense (\u201che was an authentic politician\u201d - see 9.11am) and, in an interview on Sky News this morning, Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, also spoke as if Corbyn had already gone. She said it was important for Labour to learn some \u201chard lessons\u201d from its defeat, and to listen to the views of voters who did not support the party. She said: I think it\u2019s important that the Labour party listens to the voters who switched their support to the Tories, especially in the north and the Midlands, in working class communities. In a clear criticism of Corbyn, she said Labour needed a leader who was popular in the country at large, not just with the membership. There are big issues, I think, to learn about leadership, where it is not enough to be popular in the party, you\u2019ve got to be popular in the country too ... I think Jeremy Corbyn was a decent man. And he was very popular in the party. But, as I say, that isn\u2019t enough. I think people are looking for a leader and a programme that\u2019s credible, competent and going to fight for their interests. Labour wasn\u2019t able to achieve that this time. If it focuses, sorts itself out, pulls together like a broad church, not just a collection of factional tribes, then it can start looking to win back voters\u2019 trust. Asked who she would like to see as the next Labour leader, O\u2019Grady refused to say. She wanted to see how candidates performed in the leadership contest, she said. But she said the party should choose a leader with credible policies who could win back trust. I want to see a leader who can communicate, who can come up with credible policies, but also priorities that really will improve the lives of working people ... It\u2019s got to be somebody who can win back trust, communicate well and show true leadership and grit in holding this government to account. In her Guardian article Rebecca Long-Bailey says she will be supporting Angela Rayner for deputy Labour leader. Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has been tipped as a Labour leadership candidate herself but, as the Guardian reported two weeks ago, after the election her allies said she was focusing on the deputy leadership vacancy, leading to speculation that she and Long-Bailey would run on a joint ticket. But last night\u2019s Sky\u2019s Sam Coates said that Long-Bailey\u2019s comment was premature, because Rayner is not yet ready to announce that she is running for the deputy leadership. Long-Bailey and Rayner are friends and they share a flat in London. Rayner may well end up backing Long-Bailey as leader and running for the deputy leadership, but there are some in the party who think that she would make a better leader herself and, if a friendship does rupture under the strain of a leadership contest - well, that won\u2019t be the first time that has happened in the Labour party. I\u2019m describing Clive Lewis as a Labour leadership candidate because he has confirmed that he wants to run, as has Emily Thornberry. Sir Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey also seem all but certain to run. Other people who are seriously considering running, or who at least have not ruled it out, are: Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips, Yvette Cooper, Ian Lavery, David Lammy and Dan Jarvis. But it is worth pointing out that, to be a candidate on the ballot paper, it is not enough for an MP just to declare that they are standing. They also need the support of 10% of Labour MPs (ie, 21 MPs). It used to be 15%, but the threshold was lowered after Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election as leader. Under the new rules, candidates also need the support of 5% of constituency Labour parties (CLPs) to be included on the ballot (that\u2019s 33 of them), or 5% of the union/affiliates vote. Luke Akehurst has a more detailed guide to the new rules here, in an article for Politics.co.uk. While Starmer and Long-Bailey, the two frontrunners, should easily be able to meet these requirements, some other candidates hoping to be on the ballot, including possibly Lewis himself, may find it more difficult. Here are some more lines from what Clive Lewis, the shadow Treasury minister and Labour leadership contender, said in his Today programme interview this morning. (See 9.11am.) Lewis said that the explanation for Labour\u2019s election defeat was complicated and that, although Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership and Brexit were factors, there were other reasons too, going back years. He said: It is also about the fact that for the last 40 years in this country there has been a decline in those votes in those areas where we collapsed in the general election. And this is something that has been going on for 40 years, and that includes over the period of 1997 to 2010. So to understand what actually went wrong with this vote, you need to look back further than just 2015, or 2010. It is like trying to work out the causes of the second world war by going back no further than 1938. You have to go back to 1914, and possibly beyond. We have to work out why were we not able to connect to people in these heartlands, in the north, in the east Midlands? Why couldn\u2019t we get our message across to them? He said that he knew from personal experience on the doorstep that Corbyn\u2019s leadership was a problem for the party. He restated his call for more internal democracy in the Labour party. He said the party needed to complete a \u201ccomplete analysis\u201d of why it lost the election. That had to happen quickly, he said, and the exercise should not be a sectarian one. He said he supported the inquiry being launched by Labour Together, and he said he hoped it would be rigorous. In his London Playbook briefing for Politico Europe Jack Blanchard has a good single-paragraph analysis of Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s article for the Guardian setting out her pitch for the leadership. He says: Beck\u2019s appeal: Somewhat ironically, Long Bailey\u2019s 850-word op-ed rails against New Labour \u201ctriangulation,\u201d yet itself reads rather like a carefully calibrated pitch to the different power bases within the party. It also seems to borrow heavily from several of the leadership bids we\u2019ve already heard. So there\u2019s the essential nod to Labour\u2019s trade union backers (\u201cthey are our roots in every workplace); the Clive Lewis-style hint of more power for party members (\u201cour promise to democratise society will ring hollow if we can\u2019t even democratise our own party\u201d); and the Keir Starmer-ish pledge to left-wingers that Corbyn\u2019s policy agenda will not be abandoned (\u201cwe cannot return to the politics of the past.\u201d) Then there\u2019s the establishment of working-class credentials (\u201cI grew up watching my father\u2019s friends lose their jobs\u201d); and the Lisa Nandy-style vow to return power and patriotic pride to communities (\u201cwe must revive this progressive patriotism.\u201d) If none of that sounds terribly original, well, that\u2019s because it isn\u2019t. But that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be enough to win. Good morning. I hope you all had a good Christmas. Politics Live is back today, although with parliament still in recess, and much of the UK still in holiday mode, the news agenda is looking a lot thinner than it has been recently. But the Labour leadership campaign has been rumbling on throughout the Christmas period. It is still at the preliminary skirmishes stage, but this morning Clive Lewis, the shadow Treasury minister and one of only two candidates who have confirmed that they are running (the other is Emily Thornberry) gave an interview to the Today programme about what went wrong for Labour at the election. He said on Brexit the party should have fought more strongly for remain. Asked if the party should have adopted an out-and-out remain position, he replied: I think what we have to understand is what Brexit was. For many of us watching Brexit unfold, Brexit was a policy of a faction of the Conservative party and the right of this country that wanted to put globalisation on steroids, if you want, and it was a hard right political project. And I believe that the Labour party had to fight that with all its vigour and to offer an alternative. I don\u2019t believe this was the main reason for what happened to us in the election, but I think one of the things that we have to accept is that if you pick a side, you have to then argue for that side, and argue for it comprehensively. And what we didn\u2019t do, by triangulating - one of the key USPs of Jeremy Corbyn was that he was an authentic politician, I genuinely believe that he was, but on the biggest political crisis of British modern politics we were unable, via Jeremy, to be able to take a position. I think actually we should have stood our ground and argued our case. Lewis was a member of the shadow cabinet until he resigned in 2017 so that he could vote against the bill allowing the government to trigger article 50, starting the process that will lead to the UK leaving the EU. Before the election he also strongly backed Another Europe is Possible\u2019s \u201cRemain, Reform, Revolt\u201d campaign, saying the UK should remain. I will post more from Lewis\u2019s interview, which expands on an article he wrote for the Guardian earlier this month confirming his candidature, shortly. It follows two other Labour leadership developments overnight. Rebecca Long-Bailey has made her opening pitch for the Labour leadership, avoiding any direct criticism of Corbyn but implicitly offering an alternative approach by promising to champion \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d. She did so in an article for the Guardian. My story about it is here, and the article itself is here. In her article Long-Bailey, like Lewis, criticises the party\u2019s Brexit position, saying: \u201cOur compromise solution satisfied too few.\u201d But she does not say what the party should have done instead. Ian Lavery, the Labour party chair, has confirmed that he is considering standing for the leadership. A spokesman for Lavery told the Daily Mirror: Ian is optimistic about the challenges ahead and knows there is a lot of work to be done to unify the party. He has had a tremendous amount of support and is seriously considering all of his options at present. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens (in so far as there is any), as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

In the shabby, traumatised city of Leningrad after the war in 1945, two women have survived: a tall, unworldly young woman nicknamed \u201cBeanpole\u201d and her friend Masha. The two women have a bond of friendship relating to the little boy, Pashka, that Beanpole looks after, and this becomes the keystone of a terrible, shared tragedy.

A transport ship moving wealthy evacuees of an increasingly uninhabitable Earth gets thrown off course on the way to a Martian colony. The cruise liner, replete with arcades and a psychotropic sense-memory evocation room, is self-sustaining, so survives as a generation ship. Help is always just around the corner, as are the numerous conspiracy theories damaging morale. As time grows infinite, new social structures emerge, some of which are technologically advanced, others more primitive. I\u2019ll just come out and say the words interplanetary sex cults. The film doubles down on weirdness, leaving no narrative corridor unexplored. High Life and Ad Astra both found their audiences this year, but this movie, far superior, unfortunately slipped into a black hole. <em>JH</em></p> <h2>Knife + Heart</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_CgQnqtxRQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E_CgQnqtxRQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A man goes to a nightclub, spots a fetching stranger sporting a leather getup, and scurries off with him for a casual shag in a side room \u2013 where the masked figure then murders the guy by spiked dildo. So begins an erotic slasher with a clear sense of humor about itself, counterbalanced with serious considerations for the Aids epidemic and the ostracizing of the gay, porn and gay-porn communities. A serial killer stalks the French blue-movie industry in 1979, targeting the stable of performers employed by producer Anne (Vanessa Paradis), who has some unresolved issues of her own with her ex-girlfriend and current editor Lo\u00efs (Kate Moran). As they jointly work through production on the film they title Homocidal and the body count continues to rise, director Yann Gonzalez stages ravishingly, ripely carnal set pieces at the intersection of fear and desire, a nexus at which the film\u2019s milieu of decadent queer indulgence has been comfortably situated. <em>CB</em></p> <h2>Hail Satan?</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amB2Ol6wihg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/amB2Ol6wihg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>While the premise of Penny Lane\u2019s brilliant documentary Hail Satan? initially appears to be pure sensationalism \u2013 the use of black masses to counter white supremacy \u2013 as the film unfolds, the story becomes both stranger and more uplifting. Lane introduces the devilishly good work of the Satanic Temple, a growing group of activists who are challenging the encroaching overlap between church and state through the use of satanic imagery. So, if a government building in Arkansas erects a Christian monument on its grounds, the Temple campaigns for its own religious symbol to be built nearby: a 10ft statue of Baphomet. The theory is closer to satire than satanism, but there\u2019s a deeply felt sincerity to the Temple\u2019s work also. That goes further than its defence of democracy \u2013 its there in its embrace of diversity and a pretty impeccable set of moral values. Not all heroes wear capes; some of them wear horns as well. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>The Hottest August</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bVPeRlPmLQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6bVPeRlPmLQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>We\u2019re living through a climate emergency; it\u2019s fitting then, that Canadian film-maker Brett Story has made a film about the apocalypse.

It\u2019s an eccentric buddy comedy, on par in color and tonality with Wes Anderson\u2019s works. It\u2019s a near-documentary, in its look at gang culture, gentrification, and the damaging effects of toxic masculinity. But ultimately, it\u2019s a portrait of a break-up, showing how one\u2019s heart can be tethered to a place that ultimately does not love you back. It\u2019s a film that deserved more attention than it got, and should definitely be required viewing for anyone who\u2019s moved to San Francisco in pursuit of the American dream. <em>GS</em></p> <h2>Midnight Traveler</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTT-duEoRdc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BTT-duEoRdc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There\u2019s a scene in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/24/midnight-traveler-refugee-documentary-afghanistan\">Midnight Traveler</a>, a documentary by Emelie Mahdavian, that has stuck with me probably more than any other this year: Hassan Fazili, forced out by the Taliban and deep into his family\u2019s journey from Afghanistan to Europe \u2013 one he, his wife Fatima, and two daughters consistently film on their mobile phones \u2013 recounts a story of personal terror in voiceover. The screen is full of landscapes and undramatic footage; Hassan doesn\u2019t need to show you the story to get its impact. In fact, filming his family\u2019s pain, what once felt like an act of artistic resilience, now feels ethically queasy. His meditation on the ethics of filming, of prioritizing the screen instead of the people in front of you, is one of the many surprising, deeply empathetic layers to this low-fi documentary that subverts any tropes in coverage of the \u201cmigrants\u2019 story.\u201d</p> <p>The film, stitched together by Mahdavian using the family\u2019s cellphone footage and collected via a messenger over the Fazili\u2019s two-plus year journey, communicates a much-covered crisis in bracing honesty by putting the story of a family\u2019s formative years first. Its cadre of small, relatable moments \u2013 singing in the kitchen, playing in the snow, a playful marriage quarrel \u2013 make Midnight Traveler quietly revelatory. The Fazilis are buffeted by their circumstances but not defined by them; at every turn, it prizes experience and honesty over seeking sympathy. Few films have given me the illusion of understanding another\u2019s journey this year more than Midnight Traveler; few films show more power in the quiet moments. <em>AH</em></p> <h2>The Good Liar</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljKzFGpPHhw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ljKzFGpPHhw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Graham Norton aside, Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren didn\u2019t do a lot of press for The Good Liar.

Everyone should see it. The inspiration is The Unwomanly Face Of War, the 1985 oral history of Soviet women\u2019s wartime experiences by Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich. In the shabby, traumatised city of Leningrad after the war in 1945, two women have survived: a tall, unworldly young woman nicknamed \u201cBeanpole\u201d and her friend Masha. The two women have a bond of friendship relating to the little boy, Pashka, that Beanpole looks after, and this becomes the keystone of a terrible, shared tragedy. A harrowing, vital movie. PB Aniara A rare modern film based on an epic poem, Swedish directors Pella K\u00e5german and Hugo Lilja\u2019s first feature film Aniara begins as a sci-fi adventure and ends up an exploration of chaos, despair and cultural collapse. A transport ship moving wealthy evacuees of an increasingly uninhabitable Earth gets thrown off course on the way to a Martian colony. The cruise liner, replete with arcades and a psychotropic sense-memory evocation room, is self-sustaining, so survives as a generation ship. Help is always just around the corner, as are the numerous conspiracy theories damaging morale. As time grows infinite, new social structures emerge, some of which are technologically advanced, others more primitive. I\u2019ll just come out and say the words interplanetary sex cults. The film doubles down on weirdness, leaving no narrative corridor unexplored. High Life and Ad Astra both found their audiences this year, but this movie, far superior, unfortunately slipped into a black hole. JH Knife + Heart A man goes to a nightclub, spots a fetching stranger sporting a leather getup, and scurries off with him for a casual shag in a side room \u2013 where the masked figure then murders the guy by spiked dildo.

Her vital critique of the way late capitalism is mutating both the planet and the values of the people inhabiting it invokes Karl Marx, Annie Dillard and Zadie Smith but the experience of watching is more visceral than cerebral, conjuring a genuine (and genuinely terrifying) sense of creeping, paralysing dread.

This was certainly indicated by November surveys, notably from the RICS<br><br></li> <li>Indeed, the housing market had clearly been pressurized over the previous three months by a potent cocktail of Brexit, economic and domestic political uncertainties. It is also notable that while consumers have benefited from markedly improved earnings growth and rising employment over much of 2019, these fundamentals reached a peak around June/July in terms of employment and earnings growth. <br><br></li> <li>It is possible that mortgage approvals were lifted in November by some house buyers looking to move before the General Election amid concerns over a potential change of government </li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-30T15:08:18.039Z\">at 3.08pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e09d0ea8f085eda5c10f827\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-30T10:32:10.738Z\">10.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Japan's Nikkei ends 2019 up 18%</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaf64d41d8b8c73d85bfd2ded8830ecd39d2b6a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaf64d41d8b8c73d85bfd2ded8830ecd39d2b6a0/0_0_4589_3059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Japanese Kyogen stage actor Mansai Nomura attends the final session of the year ceremony at the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Tokyo, Japan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japanese Kyogen stage actor Mansai Nomura attends the final session of the year ceremony at the Tokyo Stock Exchange today</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aflo/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/dec/30/hong-kong-recession-protests-markets-nikkei-ftse-business-live?page=with:block-5e09c3c68f087e8308e65ebb#block-5e09c3c68f087e8308e65ebb\">Those gains in Hong Kong and China today</a> have lifted Asian stock markets to their highest levels in 18 months today.</strong></p> <p>MSCI\u2019s index of Asia-Pacific stocks nudged its highest level since June 2018, as investors push shares higher in thin trading.</p> <p>Japan\u2019s Nikkei dipped slightly on its final trading session of the year, but still ended 2019 up a sizzling 18%.</p> <p>Of course, the Nikkei is still way below its all-time highs, hit three decades ago:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-24T11:52:55/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Japan's Nikkei\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-24T11:52:55/embed.html\">Japan's Nikkei</a> </figure>  <p>But overall, 2019 has been a very strong year for stock markets.

      "bodyText": "Finally, European stock markets have ended the day with a decidedly red hue. All the main indices have lost ground, not helped by the pound and the euro gaining ground against the US dollar today (bad for overseas earners). FTSE 100: down 51 points or 0.7% at 7,592 German DAX: Down 88 points or 0.66% at 13,249 French CAC: down 47 points or 0.8% at 5,989 After two weeks of gains, following the UK election, this is a return to earth for the Footsie. The temptation to bank some profits, ahead of 2020, must be strong for those investors who actually worked today (volumes remained very low). As Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: After an impressive 11 consecutive winning sessions the FTSE was on the back-foot heading towards the close. With Wall Street starting in the red, a stronger pound and little for traders to grab onto in the sluggish seasonal trading period, profit taking was the order of the day. It may be the same story tomorrow, on the final session of 2019. Until then, goodnight! GW One US-listed stock is bucking the trend, though. Nio, the Chinese electric car company, has surged 40% after posting better-than-expected results. The firm dubbed China\u2019s answer to Tesla reported a smaller loss than expected, thanks to a pick-up in revenues and higher vehicle deliveries. Marketwatch has more details: Nio reported a net loss for the quarter to Sept. 30 of 2.52 billion renminbi ($352.8 million), or RMB2.48 per ordinary share, after a loss of RMB9.76 billion, or RMB42.59 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding nonrecurring items, such as share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, the adjusted loss was RMB2.45 billion, or RMB2.38 a share, beating the FactSet consensus of a loss of RMB2.53 a share. Nice timing by Nio, with Tesla making its first Chinese deliveries today. Nio\u2019s shipments were still low, at just 4,799 vehicles in the last quarter. But that\u2019s a 35% increase, including a new five-seater SUV. Wall Street appears to have a post-Christmas hangover (and it\u2019s not alone, eh?!). Stocks are down in early trading, knocking 182 points off the Dow to 28,463. 2019 has still been a vintage year for the US market, with equities up over 20%. But the fabled Santa Rally has taken a wrong turn.... Time for a quick summary (on a quiet day). Hong Kong is expected to slump further into recession this quarter. GDP is forecast to have shrank in October-December, for the third quarter running, due to the pro-democracy protests that have been raging for months. Hong Kong\u2019s finance secretary Paul Chan warned that: Based on the situation of these few months, it is inevitable that negative growth will continue. This means the government will be less flexible in using financial resources under an economic recession.\u201d Chan is now pledging growth-friendly measures in the City\u2019s next budget, due in February. Financial workers\u2019 bonuses are expected to be hit hard by the downturn, hitting their lowest levels since the financial crisis. Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement is expected to intensify its efforts this week, with demonstrations expected to disrupt shopping around the New Year celebrations. In other news: Japan\u2019s stock market has closed for the year, up 18%. UK mortgage approvals have unexpectedly risen. They were up 6.8% year-on-year in November, to a seasonally-adjusted three-year high. Tesla has delivered its first Chinese-manufactured cars The US trade deficit has narrowed Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned pension funds and other investors to cut fossil fuel assets, as some will become worthless as the climate emergency continues. Just in: The US trade deficit has unexpectedly shrunk. Imports into America fell by 1.3% in November, while exports rose by 0.7%, according to the Census Bureau. That narrows the trade deficit to $63.2bn, down from $66.5bn a month ago, and much less than the $68.7 billion expected: That will cheer the White House, given president Trump\u2019s attempts to cut the trade gap (with mixed results). Some 1,200 kilometres north east of Hong Kong, Tesla has been delivering its fist Chinese-manufactured cars -- to some of its own staff. It\u2019s a major major milestone in the electric carmaker\u2019s global expansion efforts, says my colleague Jasper Jolly: The first 15 Model 3 cars to roll off the line at the US carmaker\u2019s Shanghai factory went to customers who were Tesla employees and were handed over in a ceremony at the plant on Monday. Tesla will ramp up production during January, marking the start of a full-on assault on the world\u2019s largest car market. It has taken less than a year from the start of construction of the $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) Shanghai factory in January to the delivery of the first vehicles. The factory, first announced in July 2018, is Tesla\u2019s first facility outside the US and will have an annual capacity of 150,000 Model 3 cars per year, compared with 350,000 in its main factory in Fremont, California. More here: European stock markets are not following Asia\u2019s rally today. Instead, the main indices are down on the City\u2019s final full trading day of 2019 (tomorrow is a half-day). The FTSE 100 is now down 30 points, or 0.4%, in very thin trading. That breaks an 11-day run of daily gains. Just 90 million trades have taken place across the FTSE 100 so far today, compared to perhaps 800m on a typical day. That suggests many investors have sloped off until the new year, preserving profits after seeing the Footsie jump by 13% this year. Stocks are suffering because the euro and the pound are both gaining ground against the US dollar, to \u20ac1.118 and $1.313 respectively. Edward Moya of trading firm OANDA reckons investors are expecting that American interest rates will remain on hold for some time (following three rate cuts since the summer). The dollar seems has seen all its gains wiped away in the final quarter of the year and we could see that trend continue as the global re-acceleration gains momentum. With the Fed on hold and the rest of the world starting to have a brighter outlook, we could see more central banks look to abandon negative rates. The reasons for further dollar weakness in 2020 are growing, but the main remains that the Fed will be on hold for the foreseeable future and we should see the euro and commodity currencies outperform. Recession warnings aren\u2019t deterring demonstrators from organising major protests later this week. Multiple protests are planned for New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day, which are designed to disrupt festivities and shopping in the City. Reuters has more details: Events dubbed \u201cSuck the Eve\u201d and \u201cShop With You\u201d are set for New Year\u2019s Eve on Tuesday in areas including the party district of Lan Kwai Fong, the picturesque Victoria Harbour, and popular shopping malls, according to notices on social media. A pro-democracy march on January 1 has been given police permission and will start from a large park in bustling Causeway Bay and end in the central business district. Organisers Civil Human Rights Front were behind the peaceful million-plus marches in June and held a mass protest earlier in December, which they said around 800,000 people attended. \u201cOn New Year\u2019s Day, we need to show our solidarity ... to resist the government. We hope Hong Kong people will come onto the streets for Hong Kong\u2019s future,\u201d said Jimmy Sham, a leader of the group. The pick-up in UK mortgage approvals in November is a \u201csignificant surprise\u201d, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club. He suspects that some home owners may have been keen to move before the general election, as a hung parliament could have created more economic uncertainty in 2020. Archer had also dug into the seasonally-adjusted data, which shows November was a particularly strong month (once you adjust for seasonal factors). Here\u2019s his take: A significant upward surprise as UK Finance reported mortgage approvals for house purchases spiked to 43,700 [seasonally adjusted] in November, which was the highest level since January 2017. Mortgage approvals had previously fallen back over the previous three months to be at a 7-month low in October November\u2019s jump in mortgage approvals was all the more surprising as the expectation had been that housing market activity would be hampered by heightened political uncertainties. This was certainly indicated by November surveys, notably from the RICS Indeed, the housing market had clearly been pressurized over the previous three months by a potent cocktail of Brexit, economic and domestic political uncertainties. It is also notable that while consumers have benefited from markedly improved earnings growth and rising employment over much of 2019, these fundamentals reached a peak around June/July in terms of employment and earnings growth. It is possible that mortgage approvals were lifted in November by some house buyers looking to move before the General Election amid concerns over a potential change of government Those gains in Hong Kong and China today have lifted Asian stock markets to their highest levels in 18 months today. MSCI\u2019s index of Asia-Pacific stocks nudged its highest level since June 2018, as investors push shares higher in thin trading. Japan\u2019s Nikkei dipped slightly on its final trading session of the year, but still ended 2019 up a sizzling 18%. Of course, the Nikkei is still way below its all-time highs, hit three decades ago: But overall, 2019 has been a very strong year for stock markets. Many indices are up over 20%, lifted by loose monetary policy, easing recession fears, and hopes of a permanent ceasefire in the US-China trade war. Back in the UK, the number of mortgages approved by banks has jumped, despite Brexit uncertainty and this month\u2019s general election. Mortgage approvals for home purchases by the main high street banks in November 2019 were 6.8% higher than a year ago, while remortgage approvals were 12.7% higher. UK Finance, the industry trade body, also reports that credit card spending fell by 3.3% year-on-year last month to \u00a310.9bn. Andrew Montlake, managing director of UK mortgage broker, Coreco, reckons some households decided to nail down their mortgage before Britons went to the polling stations: \u201cHome purchase and remortgage approvals in November held up exceptionally well given that the country was in full General Election mode. \u201cFor a lot of British households, November was a classic case of better the devil you know. \u201cThey chose to get their houses in order and secure a mortgage before a potentially disruptive election result. Despite these recession warnings, Hong Kong\u2019s stock market has closed at a five-month high today. The Hang Seng index gained 93 points, or 0.33%, to 28,319. China\u2019s market also had a good day, gaining more than 1%. Stocks rallied after Beijing announced plans to reform its interest rate system. Commercial banks are being asked to use fresh benchmark rates for new loans, which are more closely aligned to market rates. Analysts think this will lead to lower borrowing costs, stimulating the economy. Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in Hong Kong in recent days, as the pro-democracy action enter their seventh month. These latest demonstrations will have deterred some consumers from hitting the shops, hurting retail spending and helping to keep the economy in recession. The Financial Times has a piece about how Hong Kong retailers have suffered a bad Christmas period: It was clear even in November, when protesters set a Christmas tree on fire in the busy Festival Walk mall, that this season was going to be brutal for Hong Kong retailers \u2014 the mall will be closed until some time in the first quarter next year, according to its owner Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust. Since protests first started in April, visitor numbers have collapsed. In October, the most recent month for which data is available, arrivals to Hong Kong were down 43.7 per cent on a year earlier, depriving the city\u2019s businesses of more than 2.5m tourists, the overwhelming majority of them from mainland China. Overnight visitors spent an average of HK$6,614 (US$850) each on their stays in 2018, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. Along with hotels, restaurants and shop owners were the main beneficiaries, and the fall-off in tourism has battered retailers. Just in: Hong Kong\u2019s imports and exports have both fallen, as its recession dampens demand for goods and services. The Census and Statistics Department has reported that imports slumped by 5.8% year-on-year in November, while exports declined by 1.4%. Hong Kong\u2019s recession is hitting its financial sector workers hard. The city\u2019s bankers and stockbrokers are expecting to receive their smallest bonuses and pay rises since the financial crisis. This is due to the impact of the pro-democracy protests and the knock-on effect of the trade war between the US and China. The South China Post reports that bonus pots could be the shallowest in 10 years. \u201cThe pay rise and bonus in early 2020 is going to be the worst in a decade,\u201d said Gordon Tsui Luen-on, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association. Many brokerage firms froze salaries and reduced bonuses in early 2009 after the global financial crisis hit the local economy, and the Hang Seng Index plunged. Tsui believes the same will happen in 2020 with some brokerage firms even cutting salaries or laying people off. Hong Kong\u2019s administration is expected to take fresh measures to support growth in 2020. Alongside his recession warning, Paul Chan says that his budget, due in February, will include measures for: \u201csupporting enterprises, safeguarding jobs, revitalising the economy and easing poverty\u201d. Hong Kong\u2019s chief secretary, Matthew Cheung, has also warned that the City faces \u201ctough tests and challenges in 2020\u201d. In his own blogpost, Cheung wrote: \u201cThe year 2019 has been a year of unremitting shocks and turbulence to our community and our economy. The past six months have been tough for us, but we will soldier on.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The final week of the year is a time for taking stock, and looking ahead. But for Hong Kong, that means bracing for a longer downturn. The city\u2019s finance chief has warned that the economy has contracted in the last quarter of 2019, dragging it even deeper into recession. Finance Secretary Paul Chan said the protests that have gripped Hong Kong for months \u2013 and become increasingly violent \u2013 has hurt its economy badly. In a blog post, Chan warned: \u201cBased on the situation of these few months, it is inevitable that negative growth will continue. This means the government will be less flexible in using financial resources under an economic recession.\u201d Hong Kong officially slumped into recession in the third quarter of this year, with GDP contracting by an alarming 3.2% in July-September. Retail spending has suffered a major contraction, as the sight of demonstrators clashing with riot police has deterred tourists from visiting. This has had a knock-on impact on companies across the world, from airlines such as Cathay Pacific to Europe\u2019s luxury goods producers. Visitor arrivals from China fell a record 46% in October to slightly more than 2.5 million, less than half of the record set in January. The most recent data for retail sales in Hong Kong showed a 24.3% plunge, the biggest ever, according to Gulf News. Chan says this downturn has a serious impact on the government\u2019s finances: \u201cThis will leave the government with its first budget deficit in the past 15 years. The protests have dropped out of the headlines recently, after the authorities ended a siege at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. But the pro-democracy movement hasn\u2019t gone away; thousands took part in a protest yesterday. The movement plans to begin the new year with a large demonstration on Wednesday, renewing their demands for an amnesty for arrested protesters, an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and complete universal suffrage for the City. Also coming up today The economic calendar is pretty bare, beyond some UK mortgage approvals figures and US trade data. European stock markets are expected to dip a little this morning, with the FTSE 100 dipping by 13 points or 0.2% in early trading. The agenda 9.30am GMT: UK home loan approvals data for November: expected to dip to 41200, from 41219 1.30pm GMT: US trade balance for November; expected to widen to -$68.8bn, from -$66.5bn",

The Swedish climate activist made the comment during an interview on BBC Radio 4 on Monday morning, where she had been invited to guest-edit the programme. Thunberg, 16, was asked what she would have said to the leader who pulled the US \u2013 one of the world\u2019s leading carbon emitters \u2013 out of the Paris climate accord, and who has taken radical steps to undo decades-old US pollution standards. She said: \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think I would have said anything. Because obviously he\u2019s not listening to scientists and experts, so why would he listen to me?\u201d She added: \u201cSo I probably wouldn\u2019t have said anything, I wouldn\u2019t have wasted my time.\u201d Thunberg\u2019s comments came several weeks after Trump attacked her for being named Time magazine\u2019s person of the year. \u201cSo ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!\u201d Trump tweeted at the time. She has also been attacked by Brazil\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro. \u201cIt is staggering, the amount of coverage the press gives that brat,\u201d Bolsonaro said at the time. Invited to respond to her critics, Thunberg told the program \u201cthose attacks are just funny because they obviously don\u2019t mean anything\u201d. She said: \u201cI guess of course it means something \u2013 they are terrified of young people bringing change which they don\u2019t want \u2013 but that is just proof that we are actually doing something and that they see us as some kind of threat.\u201d",

Since then the rebranded Uber has burned through $10bn. It has never made a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-ipo/uber-unveils-ipo-with-warning-it-may-never-make-a-profit-idUSKCN1RN2SK\" title=\"\">profit</a>. The business model relies on shareholders to subsidise cheap rides so that the company can squeeze out rivals and establish a monopoly. Uber\u2019s success is that 90 million people now use it in 700 cities around the world. After it floated on the stock market, its two founders became billionaires. While the owners of Uber have become immensely wealthy, the people who drive its cars have paid a heavy price. Unions say that Uber drivers in the UK earn an average of \u00a35 an hour, well below the legal <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates\" title=\"\">minimum wage</a> of \u00a38.21 for employees aged over 25. They can work up to 30 hours a week before breaking even. Hundreds went on strike in May to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/08/uber-drivers-in-uk-cities-strike-over-pay-and-conditions\" title=\"\">protest</a> against poor pay and conditions.</p> <p>Across Britain, gig work \u2013 part of a casualised, precarious and on-call jobs market \u2013 is growing at a giddy rate. The sector has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/28/gig-economy-in-britain-doubles-accounting-for-47-million-workers\" title=\"\">more than doubled</a> in size since 2016 and now accounts for 4.7 million workers. In part this is due to new technology: people are using apps on their mobile phones to sell their labour. The core business model relies on near-instant recourse to a large pool of on-demand workers looking for their next gig. Uncertain work is becoming the norm, with the result that unemployment statistics look better than the way Britons feel. It is an environment of overwork, marked by intense bursts of exhaustion. One gig-economy firm <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/world/90395459/sleep-deprivation-is-your-drug-of-choice-fiverrs-uk-campaign-criticised\" title=\"\">even tried</a> to market burnout as a lifestyle by claiming its workers were \u201cdoers\u201d for whom \u201csleep deprivation is [their] drug of choice\u201d. Nothing can disguise the fact that the gig economy\u2019s rise has been accompanied by a fall in the fortunes of working households \u2013 which now <a href=\"https://home.bt.com/news/latest-news/growth-of-in-work-poverty-is-statistic-of-the-year-11364419488674\" title=\"\">comprise</a> 58% of those below the official poverty line; the figure was 37% in 1995. In a seminal <a href=\"https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:7cc5dd8e-75a8-4af5-86ab-6ed6bd615e72\" title=\"\">paper</a>, Alex Wood and other researchers at Oxford University found that half of the gig work in the UK is in our streets, supplying food or couriering parcels or offering taxi rides.</p> <p><strong>Cherrypicking workers</strong></p> <p>The other half of gig work is remote \u2013 providing digital services, such as data entry and programming, on platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer and Fiverr, which act as auction houses for human labour, where people place a bid to do the work on offer. Those in richer nations can find themselves undercut by those in poorer places. In 2017 US freelancers using <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1627475/000119312518267594/d575528ds1.htm\" title=\"\">Upwork</a> netted $27m \u2013 only a little more than those in India. Many of the world\u2019s biggest firms use these apps to <a href=\"https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/publications/platform-sourcing.pdf\" title=\"\">outsource</a> work to lower costs. Microwork, where tasks are broken down, is dominated by Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk division. Two-thirds of its US workers <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_645337.pdf\" title=\"\">earn less</a> than the federal minimum wage.</p> <p>The office faces a future like that of the factory floor in the 1980s, when work was shipped abroad to save money and boost profits. In his book <a href=\"https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2018/11/book-review-humans-service-oup-2018-jeremias-prassl\" title=\"\">Humans as a Service</a>, the Oxford academic Jeremias Prassl says the gig economy\u2019s problems \u2013 for workers and markets \u2013 are driven by firms \u201cpresenting themselves as mere intermediaries rather than powerful service providers \u2026 [to] shift nearly all of their business risk and cost onto others\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A decade ago a ride-hailing service called UberCab launched in Silicon Valley. Since then the rebranded Uber has burned through $10bn. It has never made a profit. The business model relies on shareholders to subsidise cheap rides so that the company can squeeze out rivals and establish a monopoly. Uber\u2019s success is that 90 million people now use it in 700 cities around the world. After it floated on the stock market, its two founders became billionaires. While the owners of Uber have become immensely wealthy, the people who drive its cars have paid a heavy price. Unions say that Uber drivers in the UK earn an average of \u00a35 an hour, well below the legal minimum wage of \u00a38.21 for employees aged over 25. They can work up to 30 hours a week before breaking even. Hundreds went on strike in May to protest against poor pay and conditions. Across Britain, gig work \u2013 part of a casualised, precarious and on-call jobs market \u2013 is growing at a giddy rate. The sector has more than doubled in size since 2016 and now accounts for 4.7 million workers. In part this is due to new technology: people are using apps on their mobile phones to sell their labour. The core business model relies on near-instant recourse to a large pool of on-demand workers looking for their next gig. Uncertain work is becoming the norm, with the result that unemployment statistics look better than the way Britons feel. It is an environment of overwork, marked by intense bursts of exhaustion. One gig-economy firm even tried to market burnout as a lifestyle by claiming its workers were \u201cdoers\u201d for whom \u201csleep deprivation is [their] drug of choice\u201d. Nothing can disguise the fact that the gig economy\u2019s rise has been accompanied by a fall in the fortunes of working households \u2013 which now comprise 58% of those below the official poverty line; the figure was 37% in 1995. In a seminal paper, Alex Wood and other researchers at Oxford University found that half of the gig work in the UK is in our streets, supplying food or couriering parcels or offering taxi rides. Cherrypicking workers The other half of gig work is remote \u2013 providing digital services, such as data entry and programming, on platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer and Fiverr, which act as auction houses for human labour, where people place a bid to do the work on offer. Those in richer nations can find themselves undercut by those in poorer places. In 2017 US freelancers using Upwork netted $27m \u2013 only a little more than those in India. Many of the world\u2019s biggest firms use these apps to outsource work to lower costs. Microwork, where tasks are broken down, is dominated by Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk division. Two-thirds of its US workers earn less than the federal minimum wage. The office faces a future like that of the factory floor in the 1980s, when work was shipped abroad to save money and boost profits. In his book Humans as a Service, the Oxford academic Jeremias Prassl says the gig economy\u2019s problems \u2013 for workers and markets \u2013 are driven by firms \u201cpresenting themselves as mere intermediaries rather than powerful service providers \u2026 [to] shift nearly all of their business risk and cost onto others\u201d. The simplest illustration of this is Uber\u2019s claim that its drivers are not employees \u2013 at a stroke this potentially avoids VAT liabilities of \u00a31.5bn. That sort of cash could have been used to pay towards a health service dealing with the fallout from insecure jobs with unpredictable shifts. A landmark study tracking people who lost their jobs in the recession of 2010 found that those who ended up with poor-quality work \u2013 with low pay, low autonomy, and high insecurity \u2013 had higher chronic stress levels than those who had remained unemployed. Consumer rights are being rewritten \u2013 often to the customer\u2019s detriment. People using popular takeaway apps such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo can order from thousands of restaurants without being aware of their poor hygiene ratings. Such practices undermine the trust needed for the market economy to function smoothly. Hidden beneath the claims of autonomy is the fact that the platforms exercise firm control over most aspects of how, and to what standard, work is done. The technology can monitor whether a freelancer is working for the whole time billed. It can detect whether a gig-economy driver brakes too hard. Too many low rankings might see a worker kicked off a platform. Productivity becomes the way to measure human value. Firms can cherrypick workers \u2013 usually those without children or in good health. What happens to those who have lives that don\u2019t match the gig economy\u2019s demands?

When I was young, it was precious to me, this burning fire, this smouldering rage, which I would hold between my palms like a lantern, without realising that it was not much of a provider of either light or warmth, it burned my flesh instead. But at the time anger felt good. It felt right and righteous. It even made me love <a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.2.ii.html\" title=\"\">Aristotle</a>. \u201cFor since nobody aims at what he thinks he cannot attain, the angry man is aiming at what he can attain, and the belief that you will attain your aim is pleasant.\u201d That sounded all right to me. I particularly agreed with the US philosopher and poetRalph Waldo Emerson. \u201cA good indignation makes an excellent speech.\u201d Not only speech, I thought to myself. It could also make good books, especially novels. What better motivation could there be for a novelist than the right kind of anger?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Strasbourg, \u2018revolution' was not just a noun. It was a verb, a way of life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was born in 1971 in Strasbourg, France, in a neighbourhood full of immigrants and leftist students. Here, \u201crevolution\u201d was not just a noun. It was a verb, a way of life. After my parents separated, my mother and I moved to Ankara, Turkey. In striking contrast to my first home, this was a deeply conservative, patriarchal neighbourhood. From then on, I was raised by two women \u2013 my mother and my grandmother. For many reasons I did not fit in, and I always knew it. But I wasn\u2019t an angry teenager. If anything I was silent, observant, calm. A hopeless introvert. </p> <p>When anger arrived, in my early 20s, I welcomed it with open arms. How fresh it felt, all that adrenaline. To that day I had barely seen my father. I didn\u2019t have a single childhood photo of me with him; I didn\u2019t know what his house looked like, even though he had returned to Turkey and lived not far from us.

      "bodyText": "I used to love my anger. When I was young, it was precious to me, this burning fire, this smouldering rage, which I would hold between my palms like a lantern, without realising that it was not much of a provider of either light or warmth, it burned my flesh instead. But at the time anger felt good. It felt right and righteous. It even made me love Aristotle. \u201cFor since nobody aims at what he thinks he cannot attain, the angry man is aiming at what he can attain, and the belief that you will attain your aim is pleasant.\u201d That sounded all right to me. I particularly agreed with the US philosopher and poetRalph Waldo Emerson. \u201cA good indignation makes an excellent speech.\u201d Not only speech, I thought to myself. It could also make good books, especially novels. What better motivation could there be for a novelist than the right kind of anger? I was born in 1971 in Strasbourg, France, in a neighbourhood full of immigrants and leftist students. Here, \u201crevolution\u201d was not just a noun. It was a verb, a way of life. After my parents separated, my mother and I moved to Ankara, Turkey. In striking contrast to my first home, this was a deeply conservative, patriarchal neighbourhood. From then on, I was raised by two women \u2013 my mother and my grandmother. For many reasons I did not fit in, and I always knew it. But I wasn\u2019t an angry teenager. If anything I was silent, observant, calm. A hopeless introvert. When anger arrived, in my early 20s, I welcomed it with open arms. How fresh it felt, all that adrenaline. To that day I had barely seen my father. I didn\u2019t have a single childhood photo of me with him; I didn\u2019t know what his house looked like, even though he had returned to Turkey and lived not far from us. When I was at university he once visited me, and said he had deliberately waited to see me until I was old enough, so that we could have mature conversations about history, literature and philosophy. As much as I loved history, literature, philosophy, those were the last things I wanted to talk to him about. I felt very angry that day. But it wasn\u2019t his neglect that infuriated me. It was the realisation that he was, essentially, a good man. A beloved academic, a decent democrat and, as I would discover later on, a kind and loving father to his two other children who were born in his second marriage.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Goalkeeper: Kasper Schmeichel</strong></h2> <p>Spent four years in the Championship towards the start of the decade, notably helping Leicester City to promotion to the Premier League in 2014. Began era with Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson at Notts County, for whom he kept 24 clean sheets en route to the League Two title, before reuniting with Eriksson at Leicester after impressing at Leeds. Did not miss a minute of league action across three seasons in the second tier with Leicester and remains a key pillar in the Premier League, which he won in 2016.</p> <h2><strong>Right-back: Luke Ayling</strong></h2> <p>There is no shortage of contenders for the right-back berth, from Chris Gunter to Kieran Trippier and George Baldock to Bruno, but the versatile Leeds United defender gets the nod. The former Arsenal schoolboy has become an integral part of the Leeds squad since signing from Bristol City three years ago. Won promotion to the Championship with Yeovil Town in 2013 and again two years later with City. A marauding full-back who can also operate at centre-back, Ayling has thrived under Marcelo Bielsa.</p> <h2><strong>Centre-back: Chris Basham</strong></h2> <p>A consistent performer in Sheffield United\u2019s journey from League One to the Premier League and, before that, a reliable holding midfielder for Blackpool in the Championship. Christened \u201cBashambauer\u201d by Blades supporters because of his roaming runs, the defender, who used to clean Kevin Nolan\u2019s boots at Bolton, has proved one of Chris Wilder\u2019s most trusted allies since joining on a free in 2014. Basham, described by Wilder as \u201clike gold dust\u201d, worked at McDonald\u2019s after being released by Newcastle at 16.</p> <h2><strong>Centre-back: Ben Mee</strong></h2> <p>An ever-present as Burnley won the Championship in 2016 and central to two promotion-winning seasons in three years under Sean Dyche, who named Mee as his captain in August. Forged a formidable defensive partnership with Michael Keane and since with James Tarkowski, both of whom have earned England honours. Mee, 30, celebrated his 300th appearance in a Burnley shirt this month. \u201cBen, eventually, could become Steve Bruce, in the sense that it\u2019s well documented Steve never played for England,\u201d Dyche said.</p> <h2><strong>Left-back: Enda Stevens</strong></h2> <p>Has not always been plain sailing for the Dubliner, notably during a month\u2019s loan in League Two in 2014-15 with Wilder\u2019s Northampton Town. Stevens played four games \u2013 four defeats \u2013 but left an impression on Wilder. The full-back found himself in the last-chance saloon \u2013 his career in England was ailing \u2013 but Portsmouth handed him a lifeline in the fourth tier the following summer and Stevens flourished before joining Sheffield United two years ago. Secured promotion under Wilder in May.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc5657c0d99d0323877cd2df5d3b8cd2ac855d14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc5657c0d99d0323877cd2df5d3b8cd2ac855d14/0_0_1626_1138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Football League team of the decade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Football League team of the decade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Centre midfield: Conor Hourihane</strong></h2> <p>Another player to progress from League Two to the Premier League, though the midfielder had to bide his time. Has excelled in every rung of the Football League, racking up more than 100 league games for Plymouth in the fourth tier before earning a move to Barnsley, whom he captained to promotion to the Championship three years ago. In January 2017 Steve Bruce, then in charge of Aston Villa, came calling. A standout performer en route to Villa\u2019s promotion in May and now a Republic of Ireland mainstay.</p> <h2><strong>Centre midfield: Romaine Sawyers</strong></h2> <p>Earned his stripes in League One with Walsall, missing only six league games across three seasons after being signed by Dean Smith following his release by West Brom, whom he joined aged seven. A versatile midfielder capable of hoovering up danger or unlocking defences as a No 10, Sawyers was reunited with Smith at Brentford, where he became captain last year before returning home to the Hawthorns in the summer. \u201cIf you give him time and space, he\u2019ll destroy you,\u201d said the Brentford co-director Phil Giles.</p> <h2><strong>Attacking midfield: Paul Gallagher</strong></h2> <p>A clever player \u2013 Gallagher\u2019s brain has long set him apart from the crowd \u2013 and a consistent threat, be it on the right flank in the Championship with Leicester or centrally in League One with Preston. Four years ago Gallagher signed for Preston on a permanent basis after securing promotion to the second tier. A set-piece specialist, particularly from 12 yards, in more recent years Gallagher has dictated from deep. The 35-year-old may be approaching the twilight of his career but remains an evergreen performer.</p> <h2><strong>Right wing: James Coppinger</strong></h2> <p>It is an overused word, but Coppinger is a Doncaster Rovers and Football League legend. The winger, who turns 39 in January, has been tormenting full-backs for two decades, let alone one.

      "bodyText": "Goalkeeper: Kasper Schmeichel Spent four years in the Championship towards the start of the decade, notably helping Leicester City to promotion to the Premier League in 2014. Began era with Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson at Notts County, for whom he kept 24 clean sheets en route to the League Two title, before reuniting with Eriksson at Leicester after impressing at Leeds. Did not miss a minute of league action across three seasons in the second tier with Leicester and remains a key pillar in the Premier League, which he won in 2016. Right-back: Luke Ayling There is no shortage of contenders for the right-back berth, from Chris Gunter to Kieran Trippier and George Baldock to Bruno, but the versatile Leeds United defender gets the nod. The former Arsenal schoolboy has become an integral part of the Leeds squad since signing from Bristol City three years ago. Won promotion to the Championship with Yeovil Town in 2013 and again two years later with City. A marauding full-back who can also operate at centre-back, Ayling has thrived under Marcelo Bielsa. Centre-back: Chris Basham A consistent performer in Sheffield United\u2019s journey from League One to the Premier League and, before that, a reliable holding midfielder for Blackpool in the Championship. Christened \u201cBashambauer\u201d by Blades supporters because of his roaming runs, the defender, who used to clean Kevin Nolan\u2019s boots at Bolton, has proved one of Chris Wilder\u2019s most trusted allies since joining on a free in 2014. Basham, described by Wilder as \u201clike gold dust\u201d, worked at McDonald\u2019s after being released by Newcastle at 16. Centre-back: Ben Mee An ever-present as Burnley won the Championship in 2016 and central to two promotion-winning seasons in three years under Sean Dyche, who named Mee as his captain in August. Forged a formidable defensive partnership with Michael Keane and since with James Tarkowski, both of whom have earned England honours. Mee, 30, celebrated his 300th appearance in a Burnley shirt this month. \u201cBen, eventually, could become Steve Bruce, in the sense that it\u2019s well documented Steve never played for England,\u201d Dyche said. Left-back: Enda Stevens Has not always been plain sailing for the Dubliner, notably during a month\u2019s loan in League Two in 2014-15 with Wilder\u2019s Northampton Town. Stevens played four games \u2013 four defeats \u2013 but left an impression on Wilder. The full-back found himself in the last-chance saloon \u2013 his career in England was ailing \u2013 but Portsmouth handed him a lifeline in the fourth tier the following summer and Stevens flourished before joining Sheffield United two years ago. Secured promotion under Wilder in May. Centre midfield: Conor Hourihane Another player to progress from League Two to the Premier League, though the midfielder had to bide his time. Has excelled in every rung of the Football League, racking up more than 100 league games for Plymouth in the fourth tier before earning a move to Barnsley, whom he captained to promotion to the Championship three years ago. In January 2017 Steve Bruce, then in charge of Aston Villa, came calling. A standout performer en route to Villa\u2019s promotion in May and now a Republic of Ireland mainstay. Centre midfield: Romaine Sawyers Earned his stripes in League One with Walsall, missing only six league games across three seasons after being signed by Dean Smith following his release by West Brom, whom he joined aged seven. A versatile midfielder capable of hoovering up danger or unlocking defences as a No 10, Sawyers was reunited with Smith at Brentford, where he became captain last year before returning home to the Hawthorns in the summer. \u201cIf you give him time and space, he\u2019ll destroy you,\u201d said the Brentford co-director Phil Giles. Attacking midfield: Paul Gallagher A clever player \u2013 Gallagher\u2019s brain has long set him apart from the crowd \u2013 and a consistent threat, be it on the right flank in the Championship with Leicester or centrally in League One with Preston. Four years ago Gallagher signed for Preston on a permanent basis after securing promotion to the second tier. A set-piece specialist, particularly from 12 yards, in more recent years Gallagher has dictated from deep. The 35-year-old may be approaching the twilight of his career but remains an evergreen performer. Right wing: James Coppinger It is an overused word, but Coppinger is a Doncaster Rovers and Football League legend. The winger, who turns 39 in January, has been tormenting full-backs for two decades, let alone one. Coppinger has dazzled defenders in League Two, League One and the Championship and, these days, he is far from merely making up the numbers, having played 51 matches last season. \u201cTo still be performing is the biggest thing for me and I still feel really good physically,\u201d Coppinger said. Striker: Billy Sharp Not bad for a fat lad from Sheffield. Sharp has played for six teams over the past record-breaking 10 years, notably Doncaster, Southampton and Sheffield United, and everywhere he went it rained goals; he has scored 147 in the Football League since January 2010. A talisman, Sharp has an unerring knack of being in the right place at the right time and got 23 goals for his boyhood club en route to the Premier League last season. \u201cHe just knows where the ball is going to drop,\u201d said Andy Crosby, who has played with and coached Sharp. Left wing: Marc Pugh A decade that began in League Two with Hereford United culminated in the winger being an integral part of Bournemouth\u2019s Championship title-winning campaign four years ago. Along with Matt Ritchie, Pugh tore into defences for fun as Eddie Howe\u2019s side secured two entertaining promotions in three seasons. The 32-year-old helped revive Hull while on loan last season before joining Queens Park Rangers on a free in the summer but, as far as Bournemouth are concerned, Pugh represents \u00a3100,000 well spent. Manager: Eddie Howe Howe may have not managed in the Football League since 2015, but his journey in leading Bournemouth from the foot of League Two to the Premier League in six unforgettable years is impossible to ignore.

There was clearly many a reason why Ofori should be a household name: her touring one-woman show about sex and religion was full of charisma, comedic ability and candour.

Justin Audibert The new artistic director at the Unicorn started his tenure by directing a trio of tales about the trickster spider Anansi that was a masterclass in direct, no-fuss storytelling for a young audience. His opening season, loosely built around the idea of imagining new possibilities, has plenty of enticing productions to come, including Lulu Raczka\u2019s retelling of Gulliver\u2019s Travels in a school gym, Roland Schimmelpfennig\u2019s characteristically knotty The Bee in Me and a collaboration by Sarah Argent and Guy Rhys, Robotology, which wonders what it might be like to be friends with a robot. Racheal Ofori When Racheal Ofori performed So Many Reasons at Camden People\u2019s theatre at the start of 2018, her star quality burned as brightly as the show\u2019s neon lighting design, which somehow managed to combine a vagina, a mango and the Virgin Mary. There was clearly many a reason why Ofori should be a household name: her touring one-woman show about sex and religion was full of charisma, comedic ability and candour. Currently at the National Theatre in Inua Ellams\u2019 take on Three Sisters, Ofori takes So Many Reasons to Soho theatre in March. Sadie Clark You\u2019d be forgiven for expecting any debut monologue performed in a tiny venue at the Edinburgh festival fringe to be a bit rough around the edges. But Sadie Clark\u2019s Algorithms \u2013 billed as a \u201cbisexual Bridget Jones for the Fleabag generation\u201d \u2013 was astonishingly assured and practically broadcast-ready. Developed at Soho Theatre Writers\u2019 Lab, it\u2019s sweet, sad and, as performed by Clark herself, full of heart \u2013 with more than a touch of Miranda Hart too. By rights it should have reached Fleabag-sized audiences by next summer. Michelle Tiwo Triple threat doesn\u2019t begin to cover Michelle Tiwo, the poet, actor, musician and podcaster who co-founded the Sistren broadcasting collective. Tiwo\u2019s autobiographical work, including a contribution to And the Rest of Me Floats at the Bush theatre, often explores black queer visibility. Tiwo gave a magnetic performance as the teen uprooted from London to Margate in the raucous Parakeet at the Edinburgh fringe and in April will be co-curating Inua Ellams\u2019 poetry night at the Barbican, riffing on John Singleton\u2019s classic movie Boyz N the Hood. Anisha Fields Anisha Fields is a designer whose sets keep on giving: you never know what they\u2019ll reveal next. I Wish I Was a Mountain, an adaptation of a Hermann Hesse fairytale at Bath\u2019s Egg in 2018, used a host of houses big and small to recreate a town\u2019s fair. Homes popped up inside books, sand poured out of chimneys, roofs hid all sorts of surprises. This Christmas, she dreamed up a hands-on wonderland set for the Egg\u2019s studio show Squirrel, drawing on Bauhaus designs to create a series of cones, tubes and geometric shapes that kept the young audience spellbound and created an enchanted forest scene. Shelley Maxwell At the heart of Ned Bennett\u2019s electrifying revival of Equus at Stratford East was the astonishing achievement of movement director Shelley Maxwell, who helped six actors morph into horses. Peter Shaffer, in the play\u2019s preface, raised the danger that the performers playing the animals may convey the \u201ccosy familiarity of a domestic animal \u2013 or worse, a pantomime horse\u201d. No chance of that in Maxwell\u2019s ferocious, haunting moves which stayed with you longer than any speech in the play. Maxwell, also a dancer and choreographer, went on to work on \u201cMaster Harold\u201d \u2026 and the Boys at the National. Roy Alexander Weise and Bryony Shanahan Sarah Frankcom is a truly hard act to follow but her young successors, who now share the top job at Manchester\u2019s formidable Royal Exchange, are perfectly placed. Both Roy Alexander Weise and Bryony Shanahan have established themselves as sharp directors \u2013 he with Nine Night and The Mountaintop, she with Bitch Boxer and Queens of the Coal Age. Together they plan to make work \u201cwith and for the people of Manchester\u201d: Shanahan\u2019s Wuthering Heights at the Exchange should be something special, while a freelance gig finds Weise reviving Roy Williams\u2019 Sucker Punch in London. Fanny Brouyaux and Sophie Guisset These two Belgian performance-makers \u2013 Brouyaux is based in Brussels, Guisset in Berlin \u2013 staged the most arresting duet I saw in 2019. De la Po\u00e9sie, du Sport, etc has the pair clad in mix-and-match sportswear as they race through a number of scenarios exploring competition, fear, expectation and the difficulty of staying in sync both with those around you and with yourself. One minute it\u2019s a track-and-field thriller, the next a Little Red Riding Hood chiller. This is a performance that\u2019s so packed full of ideas it demands the audience keep up to speed. It\u2019s on tour in Europe and deserves a UK date in 2020.",

      "body": "<p>The 2010s was the decade that forced American politicians and commentators to confront the limits of the country\u2019s own mythology. Political elites in both parties had long shared the same conventional wisdom about the United States, grounded in ideas of exceptionalism and institutional perfection. But with the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/22/trump-impeachment-republican-party-congress\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a> and the return of a virulent politics of xenophobia and exclusion, it became increasingly difficult, even for many in the political establishment, to reproduce these past homilies. Today the US is truly at a crossroads. Are Americans willing to confront the failures that led to the present, or will the US remain trapped in the same cycles of crisis and popular disaffection?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How can you talk about American meritocracy when so much power is defined by nepotism, incompetence and sheer impunity?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If you grew up in the US in the late 20th century, you would have imbibed a familiar account of the country. This was the idea that the US, from its founding, had always been committed to principles of universal equality, self-government and personal liberty. For starters, this consensus assumed that those in the US with wealth and power generally deserved it because they were the best and brightest. And such faith in meritocracy meant that even people on the centre left embraced American-style capitalism and the idea that the US constitution \u2013 along with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/25/trump-judiciary-judges-legal-america\" title=\"\">federal judges</a> who presided over it \u2013 produced a near-ideal realisation of democracy. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, it became a truism that victory in the cold war had vanquished all ideological competitors \u2013 proof that the country had the best and only viable means of running an economy and political system. The US was a beacon on the international stage, justly exercising power as global policeman. America\u2019s principles, coupled with cold war triumphalism, also suggested that the political change was only ever a story of improvement. As Barack Obama declared in 2008, the country was nothing less than \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/18/barackobama.uselections20081\" title=\"\">an improbable experiment in democracy</a>\u201d, one steadily being \u201cperfected\u201d, \u201cgeneration after generation\u201d.</p> <p>But as the decade began, the country was facing a series of rolling crises that challenged all of these assumptions: failing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/18/trump-syria-withdrawal-us-war\" title=\"\">overseas wars</a> started on false grounds; financial near-collapse; the social blights of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/18/mass-incarceration-black-americans-higher-rates-disparities-report\" title=\"\">mass incarceration</a> and worsening inequality. Each problem was the product of a policymaking approach rooted in the governing mythology. Yet political elites responded by essentially doubling down on the conventional wisdom. The Obama administration\u2019s strategic choices were guided by the same philosophy that had long informed American politics, above all, placing faith in markets and in national security experts (despite the recent and catastrophic failures of both). And, in the end, the policies were simply not up to the challenges of the times.</p> <p>Moreover, what the centre right and centre left could not make sense of \u2013 given their overall vision \u2013 was the extent to which the US had succumbed to deep and structural decay; a fact that both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/occupy-wall-street\" title=\"\">Occupy Wall Street</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> activists highlighted. This decay was perhaps epitomised by the profoundly anti-democratic nature of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/08/democrats-republicans-senate-majority-minority-rule\" title=\"\">American constitutional system</a> itself. This system had long been characterised by the proliferation of corporate money and by checks on popular authority \u2013 from the Senate and the disproportionate power it gave to small population centres, to gerrymandering in the House of Representatives, and from widespread practices of voter disenfranchisement to an unelected federal judiciary serving for life. And, as politicians faced overwhelming problems, such constraints only reinforced the sense of paralysis. They made it increasingly apparent that, rather than reflecting actual mass sentiment, politics was now controlled by a wealthy and white minority coalition within the Republican party \u2013 which enjoyed a veto power that was well beyond its actual public support.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s victory in 2016, despite losing the popular vote, not only made plain these institutional flaws but also made it almost impossible for establishment politicians to repeat the old truisms. How could you talk about American meritocracy when so much of political and economic power was defined by nepotism, incompetence and sheer impunity?

      "bodyText": "The 2010s was the decade that forced American politicians and commentators to confront the limits of the country\u2019s own mythology. Political elites in both parties had long shared the same conventional wisdom about the United States, grounded in ideas of exceptionalism and institutional perfection. But with the rise of Donald Trump and the return of a virulent politics of xenophobia and exclusion, it became increasingly difficult, even for many in the political establishment, to reproduce these past homilies. Today the US is truly at a crossroads. Are Americans willing to confront the failures that led to the present, or will the US remain trapped in the same cycles of crisis and popular disaffection? If you grew up in the US in the late 20th century, you would have imbibed a familiar account of the country. This was the idea that the US, from its founding, had always been committed to principles of universal equality, self-government and personal liberty. For starters, this consensus assumed that those in the US with wealth and power generally deserved it because they were the best and brightest. And such faith in meritocracy meant that even people on the centre left embraced American-style capitalism and the idea that the US constitution \u2013 along with the federal judges who presided over it \u2013 produced a near-ideal realisation of democracy. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, it became a truism that victory in the cold war had vanquished all ideological competitors \u2013 proof that the country had the best and only viable means of running an economy and political system. The US was a beacon on the international stage, justly exercising power as global policeman. America\u2019s principles, coupled with cold war triumphalism, also suggested that the political change was only ever a story of improvement. As Barack Obama declared in 2008, the country was nothing less than \u201can improbable experiment in democracy\u201d, one steadily being \u201cperfected\u201d, \u201cgeneration after generation\u201d. But as the decade began, the country was facing a series of rolling crises that challenged all of these assumptions: failing overseas wars started on false grounds; financial near-collapse; the social blights of mass incarceration and worsening inequality. Each problem was the product of a policymaking approach rooted in the governing mythology. Yet political elites responded by essentially doubling down on the conventional wisdom. The Obama administration\u2019s strategic choices were guided by the same philosophy that had long informed American politics, above all, placing faith in markets and in national security experts (despite the recent and catastrophic failures of both). And, in the end, the policies were simply not up to the challenges of the times. Moreover, what the centre right and centre left could not make sense of \u2013 given their overall vision \u2013 was the extent to which the US had succumbed to deep and structural decay; a fact that both Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter activists highlighted. This decay was perhaps epitomised by the profoundly anti-democratic nature of the American constitutional system itself. This system had long been characterised by the proliferation of corporate money and by checks on popular authority \u2013 from the Senate and the disproportionate power it gave to small population centres, to gerrymandering in the House of Representatives, and from widespread practices of voter disenfranchisement to an unelected federal judiciary serving for life. And, as politicians faced overwhelming problems, such constraints only reinforced the sense of paralysis. They made it increasingly apparent that, rather than reflecting actual mass sentiment, politics was now controlled by a wealthy and white minority coalition within the Republican party \u2013 which enjoyed a veto power that was well beyond its actual public support. Trump\u2019s victory in 2016, despite losing the popular vote, not only made plain these institutional flaws but also made it almost impossible for establishment politicians to repeat the old truisms. How could you talk about American meritocracy when so much of political and economic power was defined by nepotism, incompetence and sheer impunity? Indeed, a slew of headlines exposed how even at places like Harvard 43% of admitted white students were either \u201clegacies\u201d (related to alumni), recruited athletes or children of targeted donors (the Jared Kushners of the world). Meanwhile, the idea of either the benevolence of American power or the inherent progressive direction of national history \u2013 a new \u201cpostracial\u201d society \u2013 seemed absurd. At a time when the president and the ruling party openly embraced white nationalism and separated children at the border from their parents, it became hard to repeat bromides about the US being \u201cgreat because it was good\u201d. As the decade ends, one of the defining features of the 2020 Democratic primary has been the degree to which the old-fashioned rhetoric is being abandoned by centrist candidates, let alone more left-leaning ones. Even the New York Times, with its interactive, online 1619 project on the legacy of slavery, is demythologising the national past. But the problem today is that both Republicans and most Democrats have responded to the collapse of the American myth by peddling a version of nostalgia. Trump\u2019s nostalgia is for a 1950s America, both racially and in terms of national prosperity and prestige. But the centre left also traffics in nostalgia, even if only for a time \u2013 any time \u2013 before Trump. Alas, there is no real turning back.

      "bodyText": "Jewish groups and political leaders have issued calls for increased protection in New York after a string of attacks during Hanukah left members of the region\u2019s Jewish community on edge. On Saturday night, an attacker stabbed five people during Hanukah festivities at a rabbi\u2019s home in Monsey, Rockland county, about 30 miles north of New York City, in what Governor Andrew Cuomo called \u201can act of domestic terrorism\u201d. The attack was the latest in a string of antisemitic incidents in the region. \u201cAfter the hateful assaults we saw this past week in Brooklyn and Manhattan, it is heart-wrenching to see the holiday of Hanukah violated yet again. We are outraged because the answer is clear: the Jewish community NEEDS greater protection,\u201d the Anti-Defamation League CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, tweeted on Sunday following the stabbings. The New York police chief Terence Monahan called the attack \u201ca despicable display of hate\u201d. \u201cNYPD cops, like those who apprehended the suspect in Harlem, are protecting NYC\u2019s Jewish community. New Yorkers will see increased coverage across the city to ensure people of all faiths remain safe,\u201d Monahan added. The suspect, Grafton Thomas, 38, from nearby Greenwood Lake, escaped the scene in a vehicle and drove to Manhattan, where he was later arrested in Harlem. He was reportedly covered in blood when apprehended. Thomas was charged with five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary. At his arraignment on Sunday morning, he pleaded not guilty to all charges. Speaking at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn, where one of the world\u2019s largest menorahs was lit on Sunday evening, the New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, urged New Yorkers come together to resist the rise of antisemitism. \u201cWe have snuffed out hatred before and forced it back,\u201d he said, announcing an expansion in efforts to educate the city\u2019s school children on the issue, along with extra neighborhood policing. \u201cWe as New Yorkers have the ability to stop the hatred. We have the ability to stop the violence we have done it before and we will do it again.\u201d De Blasio invoked the Crown Heights violence of the early 90s when black and Jewish communities in Brooklyn clashed violently. \u201cIt took constant dialogue and constant effort to reach residents of the community, particularly our young people, and it took painstaking work. But the division that was healed and it has been changed into a community where people work together.\u201d The New York senator Chuck Schumer called for a federal investigation: \u201cThe attack last night in Monsey was an act of pure evil. The cascade in antisemitic attacks is outrageous throughout metropolitan New York and America, and must not be tolerated. We need a thorough federal investigation of this specific attack and all of the recent attacks.\u201d Cuomo said he had directed the state\u2019s police hate crimes task force to investigate the attacks. Visiting Monsey on Sunday morning, Cuomo said the attack was \u201cabout the thirteenth incident of antisemitism\u201d in the state of New York over recent weeks, and described the climate of intolerance as \u201can American cancer in the body politic\u201d. \u201cThis is an intolerant time in our country,\u201d he added. \u201cWe see anger, we see hatred exploding.\u201d Steve Gold from the Jewish Federation in Rockland county said the US was failing the community: \u201cMy parents were Holocaust survivors and my father made me promise to do what I can to make sure it never happens again. Today I can say I failed my father. The US has failed my parents and all Holocaust survivors. This cannot continue.\u201d Responding to the attack in Monsey, the New York city mayor Blasio tweeted that he could not \u201coverstate the fear people are feeling right now\u201d. \u201cWe will not allow this to become the new normal. We\u2019ll use every tool we have to stop these attacks once and for all,\u201d he said, adding that the NYPD has deployed a visible and growing presence around Jewish houses of worship on the streets in communities like Williamsburg, Crown Heights and Boro Park.\u201d The latest and most serious of the recent attacks comes two days after de Blasio said that police would make themselves more visible in some Brooklyn neighborhoods with large Jewish populations after the antisemitic incidents during the holiday. \u201cAntisemitism is an attack on the values of our city and we will confront it head-on,\u201d the Democratic mayor tweeted, adding: \u201cAnyone who terrorizes our Jewish community WILL face justice.\u201d On Friday, a woman slapped three other women in the face and head in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights, police said. Tiffany Harris, 30, was arrested on a hate-crime harassment charge. Earlier in the week, a Miami man was charged with hate-crime assault after police said he made an antisemitic remark and attacked a man wearing a yarmulke in midtown Manhattan. The incidents come less than three weeks since a Kosher store in Jersey City, in the neighboring state of New Jersey, was attacked as part of an hours-long assault that left six people dead, including three civilians, one police officer and both suspects. The alleged assailants were named as 50-year-old Francine Graham and 47-year-old David Anderson, who appeared to be linked to the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, which is considered to be a hate group. Across the US, other recent incidents in which swastikas or antisemitic graffiti have been used to vandalize property include a high school in Encinitas, California; a Boston elementary school; and at a synagogue in Washington DC. The latest attack in New York will increase pressure on authorities to step up efforts to protect the Jewish community in areas like Monsey\u2019s Rockland county, as well as Brooklyn\u2019s Borough Park, Crown Heights and Williamsburg, home to a large Hasidic population, as well as houses of worship. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s been a history in the region of violent attacks upon the Orthodox community,\u201d Michael Specht, the town supervisor for the area which includes Monsey, told the New York Times. \u201cThis is something very nightmarish to have happen.\u201d But some members of the Jewish community said they feared the recent incidents of antisemitism had already escalated beyond the capabilities of law enforcement to adequately protect the community. \u201cThe challenge is that there are antisemitic tendencies rising up in ways that we have not seen in a very long time\u201d the ADL regional director Evan Bernstein told CNN. \u201cThis is beyond policing. These are communal problems, societal problems, that we need to get ahead of.\u201d Bernstein said attacks on the Jewish community were under-reported because ultra-Orthodox populations were unfamiliar with technology or too isolated to notify authorities. \u201cThere\u2019s a fear of reporting, a fear of retaliation or they don\u2019t understand how to report incidents,\u201d Bernstein said. In Monsey on Sunday, more than 100 Hasidic Jews came together for a procession that ended at the crime scene \u2013 the home of Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg. The rabbi led the inauguration of a Torah scroll. Rabbi Yossi Fried, 34, shepherded a group of schoolchildren holding torches and told the Washington Post: \u201cIt has been tough, but in the Jewish religion, we are always taught that there is light, even amongst the darkness, especially with the children.\u201d \u201cThat is the message we give no matter what,\u201d he said.",

Oliver added so much to the music that his death is the starkest reminder of what is being lost in the transfer away from physical media. The consolidation of Instagram as our definitive social network and the ongoing health of fashion editorial mean that visual culture around music is absolutely not dying out, but a record sleeve knits together music and art in such a potent way. The sleeve is a curtain to be pulled up and walked through \u2013 it is the threshold of the record. Little wonder that Oliver has professed his love for the prog sleeves of the 70s designed by, among others, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/apr/18/70s-album-cover-art-hipgnosis-in-pictures\">Hipgnosis</a>.

      "body": "<p>\u2018We have the confidence and ambition,\u201d announced China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to a rapt audience last September, \u201cto forge ahead. The strong pass of the enemy is like a wall of iron, yet with firm strides we are conquering its summit. China can do it!\u201d Patriotic, martial words, fitting for a march-past of tanks and missile launchers. They were, though, spoken <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYo_fCH2UpY\" title=\"\">at the opening of the vast, all-new civilian airport</a>, Beijing Daxing, the most spectacular yet of a building type that keeps getting bigger and grander.</p> <p>Flying, of course, is an energy-intensive, highly polluting form of travel. One person\u2019s return flight from London to Edinburgh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/jul/19/carbon-calculator-how-taking-one-flight-emits-as-much-as-many-people-do-in-a-year\" title=\"\">generates more carbon emissions</a> than an average Somalian or Ugandan produces in a whole year. In Sweden, far away from Beijing, the term <em>flygskam</em>, or \u201cflight-shame\u201d, has been coined. It comes with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/26/greta-thunberg-train-journey-through-europe-flygskam-no-fly\" title=\"\">a campaign to encourage people not to fly</a>. In the world\u2019s large and fast-growing economies, however, there is no sign that political leaders are paying any attention. National pride, as well as the convenience and prosperity of their citizens, is at stake.</p> <p>In April, the first phase of the new Istanbul airport, which is planned when complete to be the busiest in the world, became fully operational. \u201cThis is not just an airport,\u201d said the posters that announced it, \u201cit\u2019s a monument to victory.\u201d Changi in Singapore, which has long striven to enthral and entertain its users, outdid itself with its new \u201cJewel\u201d extension to its existing terminals, essentially a shopping mall and nature-based theme park. From a great oculus in its glass roof descends the \u201crain vortex\u201d, a funnel of falling water described as the \u201cworld\u2019s tallest indoor waterfall\u201d. It has a \u201cbutterfly garden\u201d. It has the <a href=\"https://www.jewelchangiairport.com/en/attractions/forest-valley.html\" title=\"\">Shiseido Forest Valley,</a> a 900-tree, 60,000-shrub indoor landscape named after the Japanese-based personal care company Shiseido. The forest concept is, in marketing terms, a good fit with its corporate mission: \u201cBeauty innovations for a better world.\u201d</p> <p>There have been large and dramatic airports before, many of them in the hi-tech tradition of Norman Foster and like-minded architects: Renzo Piano at Kansai in Osaka, Richard Rogers and his partners at Heathrow terminal 5 and in Madrid, Foster in Hong Kong and at Beijing Capital airport. (The latter, huge and barely a decade old, was rapidly deemed insufficient to meet demand, which is why Daxing was built.) Most adopt an approach pioneered at Foster\u2019s Stansted in the 1980s, that of the uncluttered, elegant roof soaring over the huddled masses grinding their way through the machinery of check-in, security and duty-free. But, however spectacular they might be, they remain rooted in the idea of modernist architecture that the beauty of a building should come from its structure \u2013 those roofs are conceived as poems to engineering. The difference now is that sensation and artifice have overtaken the appearance of functionality. These are buildings that want to put on a show.</p> <p>In Daxing, the late Zaha Hadid was selected, despite little previous experience of designing airports, to work the magic she had previously shown in <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2012/10/29/galaxy-soho-by-zaha-hadid-architects/\" title=\"\">Galaxy Soho</a>, a curvaceous retail and office development in Beijing. In what turned out to be one of her last projects, she and her office created a great white world of abstracted biomorphs, whose columns and vaults might be the fronds and pads of subaquatic plants or the tendrils of sea creatures. Istanbul\u2019s new airport, designed by the London-based architects Grimshaw, claims to draw on \u201cthe architectural character of Istanbul, a city rich with colour, pattern and history since its Byzantine origins\u201d.

They are prestige projects, symbols of national pride particularly beloved of the strongman leaders now in power in many major countries, such as Xi, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in Turkey and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia. Hence Xi\u2019s speech at the opening of Daxing and an earlier visit when the airport was under construction. The new Istanbul airport is the most conspicuous item of the huge portfolio of development and infrastructure (which also includes the third bridge over the Bosphorus and a 30-mile marine canal) with which Erdo\u011fan has tried to boost both his image and the Turkish economy. The planned Red Sea resort is a pet project of the Saudi crown prince.</p> <p>Daxing and Istanbul were timed to open on politically significant dates, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the 95th anniversary of the proclamation of the Turkish republic, which in the Turkish case led to the airport being opened before it was really finished. \u201cLook how far we\u2019ve come from being a bunch of peasants,\u201d is, according to Cristiano Ceccato, the message, \u201cfrom the Long March, from people dying in the snow.\u201d</p> <p>It is therefore neither coincidental nor insignificant that the airport lies on what Ceccato calls \u201cthe national axis of China\u201d, a line heading south from the throne room of the Forbidden City, through Tiananmen gate and down the middle of the roughly symmetrical street plan of Beijing until it reaches the also symmetrical star-shaped airport. \u201cIt is incredibly symbolic to them,\u201d he says, \u201cthis is now the first gate of Beijing.\u201d</p> <p>It has been customary for decades for international airports to make more-or-less hokey references to local traditions, the architectural equivalent of the rock star saying: \u201cI love you Stockholm!\u201d The Hajj terminal in Jeddah, completed in 1981 to the designs of the American practice SOM, takes the form of multiple desert tents.

The main building at Heathrow\u2019s terminal 5 could fit twice into the central core of Daxing. You could say that the sinuous Hadid style, although not placeable to any one region of the world, has a non-western quality that suits the new world economic order of which Daxing is an expression. The airport is also Chinese in its combination of mass labour and new technology. It took huge gangs of builders, sometimes using hazardous, old-school welding techniques, to put up a complex superstructure that was aligned by lasers and verified by computers.</p> <p>The airport serves what Ceccato calls \u201ca growing entrepreneurial class in China, a very autonomous layer of society very adept at doing business\u201d. They fly a lot. They embrace the digital. And so, in addition to the conventional departure and arrivals levels is a third, located between them, for \u201cself-processing\u201d. Here, once users have registered and had their faces scanned, all further security and ticketing checks are performed seamlessly with facial recognition. If you\u2019re untroubled by this level of control \u2013 and what else might you expect in an airport but surveillance? \u2013 the system is quick and easy.</p> <p>For Ceccato, the modern airport is an essential component, a \u201cportal\u201d of a new world of mega-cities. \u201cIt is not so much that you live in this country or that country,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you live in giant urban continuum that is stitched together by air travel.\u201d An airport is creating a time-warp \u2013 \u201cif you know how to fly, how to sleep on a plane, you can suddenly be teleported between two points. You\u2019re folding space-time.\u201d He is in awe of the Chinese ability to realise projects like this \u2013 \u201cpeople will call it a dictatorship or a command society but they do get things done\u201d \u2013 which he compares with the slowness and expense of building a third runway at Heathrow: \u201cI find that befuddling and quite tragic in a way.\u201d</p> <p>Infrastructure planning by strongman leaders doesn\u2019t, in fact, always go smoothly. Whereas Daxing is integrated with a large rail and road facilities, the new Istanbul airport is awaiting its metro connections. The design of Daxing, with multiple levels in its centre and a radiating plan, keeps walking distances to gates under 10 minutes; there have been numerous complaints at Istanbul of walks of 20 minutes and more.</p> <p>It comes with severe human and environmental costs. There were at least 27 deaths in the construction of Istanbul airport, with the pressure of time cited as a contributory factor. Hundreds of thousands, <a href=\"http://bianet.org/english/environment/209630-they-said-we-will-cut-2-5-million-trees-for-3rd-airport-they-cut-13-million-instead\" title=\"\">possibly millions, of trees</a> have been cut down and ecologically rich wetlands destroyed. All for an enterprise whose economic rationale \u2013 its projections for passenger numbers, its burden on the national debt, at a time when Turkey is struggling to emerge from recession \u2013 has been questioned. \u201cThe maths just doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/apr/06/turkish-airlines-switching-to-new-airport-all-in-45-hours\" title=\"\">the economist Bahad\u0131r \u00d6zg\u00fcr told the <em>Guardian</em></a>. \u201cThis airport is a perfect symbol of modern Turkey.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Air travel is at once exciting and boring. It rearranges expectations of daylight, meal times and personal space</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ah yes, the environment. Air travel accounts for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions, which, if it may not sound hugely significant, will become more so if passenger numbers double. Frequent flying, in affluent countries, is often the greatest single contributor to an individual\u2019s output of greenhouse gases.</p> <p>Debate has broken out in the architectural profession following the publication last summer of <a href=\"https://www.architectsdeclare.com/\" title=\"\">Architects Declare</a>, a call for action on \u201cthe twin crises of climate breakdown and biodiversity loss\u201d. It was rapidly pointed out that the signatories included Zaha Hadid Architects, Foster + Partners and Grimshaw, all of them designers of major airports. Jeremy Till, head of Central St Martins school of art and design called their position \u201ca farce.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t have a carbon-neutral airport,\u201d he said. Elrond Burrell, a founding signatory of Architects Declare in New Zealand, <a href=\"https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/climate-crisis-should-architects-still-be-designing-airports/10045408.article\" title=\"\">told the <em>Architects\u2019 Journal</em></a><em> </em>that the profession needs to \u201cshow moral leadership in the climate emergency: imagine the headline \u2018Foster turns down a major airport commission.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Almost all major airports now come with claims of sustainable design, of harvesting rainwater, for example, or collecting solar energy. Western Sydney airport, say the architects, will incorporate \u201csustainable design principles across the building\u2019s architecture as well as its construction principles\u2026 The project integrates the extensive use of daylight, natural ventilation and water recycling to create a modular, energy-efficient design.\u201d</p> <p>For Fosters, air travel is desirable: it \u201cenables people to forge cultural connections, grow their businesses and see the world\u201d. They add that \u201cmost sustainable climate scenarios accepted by the UN acknowledge that the aviation industry must grow over the coming years\u201d. New technologies, they say, will eventually reduce the emissions and consumption of aeroplanes. Meanwhile, the best thing an architect can do is to \u201ctake the lead to design the sustainable airports of the future\u201d. It is beyond architects\u2019 power to redesign international travel, goes the argument, so they should apply their skills where they can to the structures that serve it.</p> <p>It is unlikely that the concerns of western architects will have an impact on the growth of Chinese air travel, driven by a newly prosperous generation who, in many cases, are flying for the first time. The concept of <em>flygskam</em> will, hopefully, get established flyers to ask if their flights are really necessary and to find alternative means \u2013 a video conference, a train journey \u2013 where they can. One might hope that, leading by example, they might offer a version of the good life to be followed around the world, based on the realisation that air travel, with or without fountains and biomorphic architecture, is not actually that pleasant. The much greater likelihood is that the current expansion will carry on regardless.</p> <p>So there will be more Daxings and Changis, possibly bigger, probably more lavish. Their users will be grateful for their convenience and for the freedoms they give them. They might marvel at the oases and the curvy architecture. They won\u2019t much mind feeding their faces into the airport computers, if it smooths their passage. If the building also serves as authoritarian propaganda, they may not notice.</p> <p>Air travel creates a strange version of reality. It is anaesthetising and anxious at once, exciting and boring. It rearranges your expectations of daylight, meal times, mobility and personal space. It elides some differences \u2013 between countries, for example \u2013 and heightens others, such as the divide between those who do and don\u2019t fly. The new breed of airports take that altered reality and alter it some more, to create their own version of the world.</p> <p>If you want to be dystopian, airports are prototypes for sinister societies of the future, products of the military-entertainment complex where dictatorial government colludes with big business to create controlling environments. Where individuals are pacified by distractions and ruled by technology. If cities and airports really do become identical, that would indeed be scary. Or you could choose to trust that important distinctions will be maintained, contemplate the splendour of the modern airport and enjoy the waterfalls.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018We have the confidence and ambition,\u201d announced China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to a rapt audience last September, \u201cto forge ahead. The strong pass of the enemy is like a wall of iron, yet with firm strides we are conquering its summit. China can do it!\u201d Patriotic, martial words, fitting for a march-past of tanks and missile launchers. They were, though, spoken at the opening of the vast, all-new civilian airport, Beijing Daxing, the most spectacular yet of a building type that keeps getting bigger and grander. Flying, of course, is an energy-intensive, highly polluting form of travel. One person\u2019s return flight from London to Edinburgh generates more carbon emissions than an average Somalian or Ugandan produces in a whole year. In Sweden, far away from Beijing, the term flygskam, or \u201cflight-shame\u201d, has been coined. It comes with a campaign to encourage people not to fly. In the world\u2019s large and fast-growing economies, however, there is no sign that political leaders are paying any attention. National pride, as well as the convenience and prosperity of their citizens, is at stake. In April, the first phase of the new Istanbul airport, which is planned when complete to be the busiest in the world, became fully operational. \u201cThis is not just an airport,\u201d said the posters that announced it, \u201cit\u2019s a monument to victory.\u201d Changi in Singapore, which has long striven to enthral and entertain its users, outdid itself with its new \u201cJewel\u201d extension to its existing terminals, essentially a shopping mall and nature-based theme park. From a great oculus in its glass roof descends the \u201crain vortex\u201d, a funnel of falling water described as the \u201cworld\u2019s tallest indoor waterfall\u201d. It has a \u201cbutterfly garden\u201d. It has the Shiseido Forest Valley, a 900-tree, 60,000-shrub indoor landscape named after the Japanese-based personal care company Shiseido. The forest concept is, in marketing terms, a good fit with its corporate mission: \u201cBeauty innovations for a better world.\u201d There have been large and dramatic airports before, many of them in the hi-tech tradition of Norman Foster and like-minded architects: Renzo Piano at Kansai in Osaka, Richard Rogers and his partners at Heathrow terminal 5 and in Madrid, Foster in Hong Kong and at Beijing Capital airport. (The latter, huge and barely a decade old, was rapidly deemed insufficient to meet demand, which is why Daxing was built.) Most adopt an approach pioneered at Foster\u2019s Stansted in the 1980s, that of the uncluttered, elegant roof soaring over the huddled masses grinding their way through the machinery of check-in, security and duty-free. But, however spectacular they might be, they remain rooted in the idea of modernist architecture that the beauty of a building should come from its structure \u2013 those roofs are conceived as poems to engineering. The difference now is that sensation and artifice have overtaken the appearance of functionality. These are buildings that want to put on a show. In Daxing, the late Zaha Hadid was selected, despite little previous experience of designing airports, to work the magic she had previously shown in Galaxy Soho, a curvaceous retail and office development in Beijing. In what turned out to be one of her last projects, she and her office created a great white world of abstracted biomorphs, whose columns and vaults might be the fronds and pads of subaquatic plants or the tendrils of sea creatures. Istanbul\u2019s new airport, designed by the London-based architects Grimshaw, claims to draw on \u201cthe architectural character of Istanbul, a city rich with colour, pattern and history since its Byzantine origins\u201d. Jewel Changi airport is designed by the Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie and his office, who created Singapore\u2019s Marina Bay Sands casino hotel, famous for a 150-metre infinity pool within a 340-metre-long \u201csky park\u201d perched 57 storeys in the air. Similar tendencies can be found at a smaller scale, with an airport that Foster + Partners are designing to serve the Red Sea Project in Saudi Arabia, the self-described \u201cworld\u2019s most ambitious luxury tourism development\u201d. Here, say the architects, the airport will be \u201can integral part of the visitor experience\u201d with an \u201coasis landscape\u201d running through it. The design is \u201cinspired by the colours and textures of the desert\u201d, its roofs shaped like dunes. \u201cWe have moved away from the traditional air-conditioned air bridges that connect the planes,\u201d Fosters tell me, \u201cand opted for an arrival experience through lush landscaped gardens.\u201d Such airports seek to be more than large pieces of transport equipment.

It cannot at first be comprehended. It slowly dawns on you. The Jewel is conceived as a destination in its own right, a place to visit even if you are not catching a flight. \u201cWe have people coming here to study,\u201d a senior Changi executive told CNN. \u201cWe have people coming here on dates. In fact, we always get requests from residents who want to take wedding photos.\u201d It is sometimes pointed out that a modern airport occupies the ground area of a traditional city and has a comparable daytime population. With its shops and parks, and its settings for romance and afternoons out, Changi is taking on more of the functions of a city, too. The wave of airport building is partly a function of demand, especially in the fastest-growing economies of the world. The annual number of air passengers in China has increased from 230 million in 2009 to 611 million in 2018 and is projected to reach 3.5 billion in 2040.

Elrond Burrell, a founding signatory of Architects Declare in New Zealand, told the Architects\u2019 Journal that the profession needs to \u201cshow moral leadership in the climate emergency: imagine the headline \u2018Foster turns down a major airport commission.\u2019\u201d Almost all major airports now come with claims of sustainable design, of harvesting rainwater, for example, or collecting solar energy. Western Sydney airport, say the architects, will incorporate \u201csustainable design principles across the building\u2019s architecture as well as its construction principles\u2026 The project integrates the extensive use of daylight, natural ventilation and water recycling to create a modular, energy-efficient design.\u201d For Fosters, air travel is desirable: it \u201cenables people to forge cultural connections, grow their businesses and see the world\u201d. They add that \u201cmost sustainable climate scenarios accepted by the UN acknowledge that the aviation industry must grow over the coming years\u201d. New technologies, they say, will eventually reduce the emissions and consumption of aeroplanes. Meanwhile, the best thing an architect can do is to \u201ctake the lead to design the sustainable airports of the future\u201d. It is beyond architects\u2019 power to redesign international travel, goes the argument, so they should apply their skills where they can to the structures that serve it. It is unlikely that the concerns of western architects will have an impact on the growth of Chinese air travel, driven by a newly prosperous generation who, in many cases, are flying for the first time. The concept of flygskam will, hopefully, get established flyers to ask if their flights are really necessary and to find alternative means \u2013 a video conference, a train journey \u2013 where they can. One might hope that, leading by example, they might offer a version of the good life to be followed around the world, based on the realisation that air travel, with or without fountains and biomorphic architecture, is not actually that pleasant. The much greater likelihood is that the current expansion will carry on regardless. So there will be more Daxings and Changis, possibly bigger, probably more lavish. Their users will be grateful for their convenience and for the freedoms they give them. They might marvel at the oases and the curvy architecture. They won\u2019t much mind feeding their faces into the airport computers, if it smooths their passage. If the building also serves as authoritarian propaganda, they may not notice. Air travel creates a strange version of reality. It is anaesthetising and anxious at once, exciting and boring. It rearranges your expectations of daylight, meal times, mobility and personal space. It elides some differences \u2013 between countries, for example \u2013 and heightens others, such as the divide between those who do and don\u2019t fly. The new breed of airports take that altered reality and alter it some more, to create their own version of the world. If you want to be dystopian, airports are prototypes for sinister societies of the future, products of the military-entertainment complex where dictatorial government colludes with big business to create controlling environments. Where individuals are pacified by distractions and ruled by technology. If cities and airports really do become identical, that would indeed be scary. Or you could choose to trust that important distinctions will be maintained, contemplate the splendour of the modern airport and enjoy the waterfalls.",

      "body": "<p>Often, tinned prunes are blamed, or the prunes and custard at school, or the cut-glass bowl full of them in a seaside hotel dining room with wallpaper that smelled of mince and Benson &amp; Hedges. Yet there is no blame or trauma on my part: the tin of prunes in syrup my grandma always kept in the cupboard next to the peaches and pears; the bag of teddy bear noses (more on this later) on the shelf; or the bowls of soaked prunes, which looked like enormous sea slugs, on whatever sideboard: I liked them all. So black and thick, their sweetness concentrated and almost spicy.</p> <p>Then there were what I thought of as \u201cgrown-up\u201d prunes: the tin of stuffed prunes Dad bought Mum for Christmas every year. I now know they were prunes d\u2019Agen, named after a town in Aquitaine in south-west France and stuffed with prune cream. But back then they were simply prunes stuffed with prunes: something I liked, stuffed with more of that thing \u2013 only 10 times darker and richer than the tins or the bags. Like a spray of a friend\u2019s mum\u2019s perfume or a swig from a bottle of advocaat, they were even better for being taken illicitly. Like other edible gifts, the tin of prunes used to be kept under the coffee table in the living room. To take one, I would lie on the rug, which meant there was a risk that the sticky prune would, like the toffee Quality Street, collect fluff (this was never a problem).</p> <p>At Christmas, there were also prunes soaked in alcohol that were eaten with roast meat and prunes drowned in red wine, both of which were good. Then, in my 20s, I made <a href=\"https://racheleats.wordpress.com/2009/10/11/muskily-spiced-prunes/\" title=\"\">Nigella Lawson\u2019s muskily spiced prunes</a>. Poached in earl grey tea with marsala and muscovado sugar, these prunes are, as Nigella promises, pretty damned fabulous, even if made with teddy bear noses (her words) rather than tender-bellied Agen. Nigella also notes that prunes can never win unanimous support, which made me like them even more \u2013 who needs complete agreement when you are in tune with Nigella?</p> <p>Today\u2019s recipe owes a lot to Nigella\u2019s musky prunes, and also a pudding-cake from Brittany called <em>far breton aux pruneaux and zabaglione</em>. The collision of these three recipes produces something between a set custard and bread-and-butter pudding, with prunes and marsala. I am a big fan of marsala, an amber fortified wine from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/may/28/west-sicily-marsala-contessa-mozia\" title=\"\">city</a> of the same name on the west coast of Sicily: as a drink, but also for cooking in sauces or as the base of soups, when we don\u2019t have a bottle of wine open. Marsala has a prune-like quality: a rich, ambivalent sweetness and 18% alcohol volume, which is why it pairs so well with prunes, plumping them up and flavouring the custard.</p> <p>Eaten while still warm, this pudding is a softly set custard; as it cools, it firms up and can be cut into squares (yes, it can be made a day in advance). Prune lovers: you could soak some extra prunes in more warm marsala \u2013 and maybe a spoonful of muscovado sugar, too \u2013 and leave them in a cut-glass bowl on the sideboard for those who want extra.</p> <h2><strong>Prune, marsala and custard pudding</strong></h2> <p>Prep <strong>15 min<br></strong>Soaking <strong>2 hr+<br></strong>Cook <strong>50 min<br></strong>Serves <strong>6</strong>, generously</p> <p><strong>200ml marsala</strong>, warmed<br><strong>20 pitted prunes<br>4 large eggs<br>150g caster sugar<br>50g butter</strong>, melted<br><strong>900ml whole milk<br>220g plain flour<br>A pinch of salt<br>Butter</strong>, for greasing</p> <p>Pour the warmed marsala over the prunes and leave to sit for two hours or ideally overnight.

I Am What I Am, his signature anthem from La Cage aux Folles, is a song to be scaled whenever drink has been taken and identity totters: by a spangled diva in the spotlight, a club kid staking a claim, a bridesmaid clinging desperately to dignity.

      "bodyText": "I was leaving a wedding when I heard that Broadway legend Jerry Herman had died, which feels about right. I Am What I Am, his signature anthem from La Cage aux Folles, is a song to be scaled whenever drink has been taken and identity totters: by a spangled diva in the spotlight, a club kid staking a claim, a bridesmaid clinging desperately to dignity. Anxious, defiant, you stare into the dazzle, hitch up your tits and sing. La Cage is a Feydeau farce with show tunes, pitting a cabaret queen against the moral majority, with a book by Harvey Fierstein (who later lent his gravel-pit register to the song on Broadway). When drag queen Albin is disinvited from his own son\u2019s wedding, he refuses to shuffle out of the picture.

      "bodyText": "One firefighter has died and multiple properties are feared lost after terrifying bushfires driven by extreme weather conditions swept across four Australian states on Monday. The volunteer firefighter from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service died when a truck rolled near Jingellic, about 70km east of Albury, on the border with Victoria. The RFS said two trucks, including the one in which the firefighter died, had been overturned by high winds. Two others suffered burns in the crash. Ten people have now died during one of the worst bushfire seasons in the nation\u2019s history, which have burned through more than 4.6m hectares. The extreme weather conditions were expected to worsen late on Monday, after a horrific day in the East Gippsland region of Victoria, where authorities had called for mass evacuations. Temperatures reached above 40C in all states, including Tasmania, where Hobart recorded 40.8C, its hottest December day ever. Several properties were reportedly lost in fires near Fingal in the north of the island state. On Monday evening, 16 emergency-level fires were burning in Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales. In South Australia, conditions had been rated catastrophic across much of the state, but it survived the day without feared extensive property losses. Firefighters were bracing for further strong winds, in some places forecast to reach up to 120km an hour, and dry lightning strikes, which authorities fear could be ruinous after a day of sweltering heat. New South Wales was expected to face the worst threat on New Year\u2019s Eve. The most extensive fires on Monday were burning in the East Gippsland region, a popular coastal holiday destination east of Melbourne, where an estimated 30,000 visitors have been staying over the New Year period. By late Monday, nine emergency-level fires were burning in East Gippsland. One fire, sparked by dry lightning between Cann River and Mallacoota, travelled 24km in six hours early on Monday morning. Two fires that merged sent plumes of smoke as high as 12km into the sky. The Victorian Emergency Management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said it had been a \u201chigh-risk day\u201d in Victoria and people who chose to stay at the holiday town of Lakes Entrance might now be stuck there. Earlier, authorities had said people should be safe in the town itself, but all roads in and out were cut by the fires. \u201cWe recently looked at the columns, and they\u2019re generating their own weather,\u201d Crisp said. \u201cThere\u2019s lightning coming out of these columns. It is unpredictable, it\u2019s dangerous out there, and people need to stay tuned to their local conditions and stay across that good information so they can make good decisions.\u201d Three of the fires in East Gippsland have been burning for more than a month. Elsewhere in Victoria, an out-of-control bushfire damaged several homes in Melbourne\u2019s northern suburbs. Properties in the areas of Bundoora, Greensborough and Mill Park had to be protected by water bombers as fire swept suddenly out of the Plenty Gorge Creek. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, returned to Melbourne from a family holiday and was being briefed on the fires on Monday evening. In New South Wales a fire-generated thunderstorm, or pyro-cumulonimbus, formed over fires burning near the south coast. A pyro-cumulonimbus can create erratic winds and dry lightning and result in significantly faster fire spread. Temperatures were forecast to exceed 40C in western Sydney and parts of regional New South Wales on Tuesday. As the fire emergency that has ebbed and flowed for several months continued, many regional communities and two Sydney councils cancelled scheduled New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks shows. On Monday afternoon the Rural Fire Service gave the go-ahead for the Sydney Harbour fireworks show to go ahead after a fierce public debate about whether it was appropriate or safe during the bushfire crisis. The New South Wales deputy premier, John Barilaro, said it was \u201can easy decision\u201d that the Sydney display should be cancelled, but the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, and Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore, both insisted it should go ahead. More than a million people are expected to line the harbour to watch the display, including many foreign visitors.",

There used to be a demarcation between the \u201ccentre right\u201d and the extremes beyond, summed up by Cameron\u2019s description of Ukip as \u201cfruitcakes, loonies and closet racists, mostly\u201d. Not so today: far-right thug Tommy Robinson reportedly celebrated the Tory electoral win by claiming he was joining the party; Britain First apparently urged its supporters to join to \u201cmake Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership more secure\u201d; while racist provocateur Katie Hopkins boasted to Sayeeda Warsi that \u201cit\u2019s OUR party now\u201d. The far-right threat against minorities and the left will heighten: but the latter will be portrayed as a dangerous rabble. The acceptance of that narrative helps explain how, during the election, the alleged assault of two Labour canvassers in their 70s was largely ignored, while the supposed punching of a Tory adviser by a Labour activist, which never happened, attracted widespread publicity. All of this is bleak, yes: but it\u2019s better to be prepared than to be overwhelmed by the coming deluge. A traumatised left must unite in the face of unprecedented adversity. In Hungary, the centre-right Fidesz party radicalised when in office into an authoritarian rightwing extremist administration that has destroyed the substance of democracy while maintaining its pretence. It is not inevitable the same will happen here, but it is entirely plausible. Progressives should buckle up: brace, brace. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "We will be closing this blog now. You can read a wrap of today\u2019s events here until we restart our coverage. A firefighter has been killed and three taken to hospital when extreme winds associated with a bushfire near Jingellic rolled two vehicles. That fire is currently burning across the border of NSW and Victoria. Multiple properties are feared lost but there have been no confirmations. Fires are creating their own storms, generating lightning in some firegrounds. Currently there are 14 emergency warnings for fires in Victoria, largely concentrated in the East Gippsland area. About 40,000 people were urged to leave the area ahead of extreme fire danger today, but many remained. Homes and lives are under threat and in many places people have been told it is too late to leave and they need to take shelter. Roads in and out of Lakes Entrance are closed, and the Princes Highway was also closed. An emergency-level fire broke out in the suburban Melbourne area of Bundoora, threatening homes. In NSW there are four emergency-level fires (including that one near Jingellic). Tasmanian fire authorities have issued four emergency warnings stemming from two fires \u2013 one near Pelham in the south and another near Fingal in the north-east. All six states as well as the Northern Territory reached temperatures exceeding 40C today, with Hobart recording its hottest December day. The NSW fire service has given the green light the Sydney New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks display, after widespread debate about whether it should go ahead. Canberra and Parramatta are among the cities and councils across NSW and the ACT to cancel their fireworks displays because of the high fire danger. The Falls Festival in Lorne has been cancelled because of the fire risk, and a number of artists are hastily organising individual concerts, with proceeds going to firefighters and those affected. A south-westerly change is expected around midnight in the East Gippsland region and will likely drive fires in a north-easterly direction. Fires are threatening homes and lives and in many places it is too late to leave. Check with the CFA website and local emergency information providers for more details. Firefighters are \u201cundertaking asset protection in private property\u201d at Bruthen and Ramrod Creek, the CFA says. The Marthavale-Barmouth Spur fire there is out of control and subject to an emergency warning. It has created a large column and is dropping embers and creating spot fires. It\u2019s currently north of Bruthen. Aircraft are tasked to assess a fire situation near Suggan Buggan but haven\u2019t been able to do so recently, the CFA says. The NSW RFS has released a little more information about the incident near Jingellic in the state\u2019s south, where a firefighter died this evening. The two firefighters who were injured, suffering burns, have been taken to hospital. A second vehicle working in the area was also blown over by the extreme winds associated with the fire and the firefighter on board has also been taken to hospital. \u201cThe service\u2019s thoughts are with all the firefighters\u2019 families, friends, and fellow brigade members,\u201d the RFS said. There are 14 emergency warnings in the state of Victoria due to these awful bushfires. The most recent warning from the CFA is for those in and around Mallacoota where it is too late to leave and people must take shelter indoors immediately to survive. \u201cLeaving now would be deadly,\u201d the CFA said. The Genoa-Mallacoota Road is closed, so there is no way in or out. The bushfire is travelling from Wingan River towards Mallacoota, and there is potential for lightning associated with fire smoke. A south-westerly wind change is expected to reach Mallacoota by 4am, with winds gusting at 40-60km/h. This warning was issued for Genoa, Gipsy Point, Karbethong, Lake View, Mallacoota, Maramingo Creek, Wallagaraugh, Wangarabell, Wingan River and Wroxham. (Note, with the photo below, Rachel Hocking has corrected to say it was taken at Tamboon, about 20km from Lakes Entrance.) The Tasmanian Fire Service says there are unconfirmed reports of houses having been lost at Mangana, near Fingal, in the state\u2019s north-east. Peter Middleton, from the fire service, told local ABC the fire danger in affected parts of the state was in the very high-to-severe range and would continue into the night. As previously reported, Fingal, Mangana and Tower Hill are considered at severe risk over the next 90 minutes. An evacuation centre at Fingal has been moved east to St Marys hall. Middleton said: \u201cWe\u2019ve heard there are possible house losses\u2026 but certainly don\u2019t have anything confirmed to say how many.\u201d The state\u2019s other significant fire, near Pelham, is heading towards Elderslie and Broadmarsh, fanned by a strong westerly. \u201cThere is serious concern for those areas because of the winds we\u2019re getting at the moment,\u201d Middleton said. The evacuation centre for the Pelham fire is at Brighton Civic Centre. A NSW firefighter has died and two others have suffered burns while battling the fire at Jingellic, east of Albury. The RFS said it\u2019s believed their truck was hit by extreme winds and rolled. This is a fire that has crossed the state border into Victoria, and is threatening Walwa, Guys Forest, Mount Alfred, Cudgewa, Burrowye, where residents have been told they should evacuate immediately. There are four emergency warnings in Tasmania, stemming from two fires. A bushfire will put Fingal as well as Mangana and Tower Hill at severe risk within the next 90 minutes, and will be difficult to control. And that Pelham fire in the south has also sparked two warnings. One for Elderslie and Broadmarsh, which are expected to come under high risk now and into the evening. The second warning is for Pelham and surrounding areas. The TFS says this fire will put lives in danger and may destroy homes in Pelham as well as surrounding areas. It is fast moving and burning in a south-easterly direction towards Horners Road Bluff Road, Elderslie and Broadmarsh. \u201cThe fire is creating dangerous spot fires ahead of the main fire front.\u201d There is a new emergency warning for a fire in NSW, in the Bega Valley to the north of Bemboka. People in the area from Yankees Gap to Bemboka are advised to leave now towards Bega if that is their fire plan or if they are not prepared. People in Numbugga should watch out for embers and spot fires, and monitor conditions. According to Live Traffic, the Snowy Mountains Highway is closed in both directions from Steeple Flat to Bega, between Monaro Highway and Princes Highway. The NSW RFS has published a series of pretty worrying maps ahead of conditions worsening tomorrow. With fires burning around the border region of NSW and Victoria, we are starting to see single fires burning in two states. We\u2019ll do our best to stay on top of those, but bear in mind the separate state fire authorities give different names to the fires, with state-specific warnings and information. The CFA has issued an emergency warning for Walwa, Mount Alfred, Guys Forest, Burrowye, Cudgewa, Cudgewa North and Tintaldra. The fire is 13km west-north-west of Walwa (referred to in NSW as the emergency level fire at Green Valle, Talmalmo) and is not under control. It has crossed the border and is moving in a south-easterly direction towards Walwa and Shelley Walwa Road. The CFA warns it could impact Walwa within the next three hours, and that leaving now is the safest option. The NSW RFS describes this fire as burning in the Jingellic area to the east of Albury, increasing in the area of River Road on the north side of the Murray River, where crews are working to protect property. It is too late to leave for NSW residents in the area of River Road and Jingellic. Seek shelter as the fire approaches. We are hearing reports on the ground that the fire is within 10km of Bairnsdale. At 2.30pm, Gippsland fire incident controller Ben Rankin said the fire had yet to leave public land, apart from the occasional spot fire in a paddock at Tambo Crossing. Jenny and Alan Blair were planning to leave their house on Orrs Road, Wy Yung, when embers began to fall in their backyard. They did not last that long. At 4pm, Jenny says, she looked outside and saw two huge columns of smoke, from the Barmouth Spur and W Tree fires, bearing down on their 15-acre property. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see embers but we just saw that,\u201d Jennys says. \u201cIt was like: look, we have to go now.\u201d Alan was planning to stay, but changed his mind when he saw the scale of the fire. Soon after they left, a neighbour who remained said the fire had reached Orrs Road. It\u2019s a long road, says Jenny. The house might be OK. Or it might not. They are staying with their son in the other side of town. \u201cWe have a spare room that we were planning to offer to people who need it,\u201d Jenny said. \u201cNow we\u2019ll be in someone\u2019s spare room.\u201d While the Sydney fireworks are going ahead, National Parks and Wildlife have decided to close the viewing areas at North Head and Bradley\u2019s Head (ticket holders for the latter will be refunded). This decision was made in the interest of public safety due to the severe fire danger and very high winds predicted for tomorrow. Emergency vehicles, residents, and Q Station guests will still have access to North Head Scenic Drive, but that road and the top part of Darley Road will be closed from 8am. The NSW Rural Fire Service has given the green light to Sydney\u2019s New Years Eve fireworks show tomorrow. Regional fireworks shows have been cancelled or postponed across the state because of the fire risk, and just a few hours ago the Parramatta city council also announced they were cancelling their show. This morning the deputy premier, John Barilaro, said it was \u201can easy decision\u201d and called for Sydney\u2019s to be canned. But the City of Sydney \u2013 amid much debate \u2013 said it wouldn\u2019t cancel unless the RFS asked them too. A short time ago the RFS approved the event, and said they were assessing a few other exemptions to the total fire ban. There are 11 emergency warnings for fires in Victoria, four in NSW, and one in Tasmania. Victoria\u2019s warnings are spread across the East Gippsland region, in suburban Melbourne, and in the Burrowa Pine Mountain national park. The four in NSW are at Talmalmo, Dunns Road, Charleys Forest, and Wyndham. Tasmania\u2019s is at Pelham. Over in the UK, the BBC has put climate change and the Australian bushfires at the top of its news agenda on Radio 4. Back in November the BBC announced that Greta Thunberg would be a guest editor of its flagship radio news programme, Today. The bushfire crisis here was the number two item, after climate change warnings from the governor of the reserve bank. The programme\u2019s producers also arranged for Thunberg to meet Sir David Attenborough. Three houses have sustained minor damage in the bushfire at Bundoora. \u201cMFB and CFA firefighters remain on scene to continue tackling the blaze with a wind change expected to come through this evening,\u201d the Melbourne Fire Brigade said. A waterbombing aircraft is among more than 20 appliances on the scene in suburban Melbourne. Chris Hopkins and Calla Wahlquist have been out at Bairnsdale today. These photos from Hopkins show the 12km-high smoke plume from two merged fires - the W Tree fire and the Barmouth Spur fire. Hobart is among a list of Tasmanian centres to have experienced their hottest December day on record, the Bureau of Meteorology says. The temperature in the state capital peaked at 40.8C shortly before 2pm. The previous benchmark for December was 40.6C, set 122 years ago in 1897. The unusually high Tasmanian temperatures meant all six states and the Northern Territory recorded temperatures north of 40C. It reached 41.9C in Adelaide and, at the time of writing, 40.8C in Melbourne. Avalon Airport, between Melbourne and Geelong, hit 44.4C, and Alice Springs reached 42C. The hottest place in the country was Onslow, in the Pilbara, with 46.9C. Marree, in northern South Australia, reached 46.7C; Birdsville, in south-west Queensland, 46.3C. Jonathan How, forecaster with the bureau\u2019s Australian weather desk, said it was not unusual for all mainland states to reach 40C on the same summer day but it was rare for Tasmania to join them. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you see all the time,\u201d he said. The list of Tasmanian places to set maximum temperature records for December included Launceston (equalling the previously mark of 34.1C), Cape Bruny (39.2C) and Mount Wellington (28.6C). In Victoria, there were new December highs at Wilsons Promontory (40.2C), Wangaratta (43.1C) and several centres in fire affected Gippsland including Bairnsdale (43.6C), Orbost (43.1C) and East Sale (43.5C). There is an emergency alert for a bushfire in Tasmania. An uncontrolled fire has broken out at Pelham with fire authorities warning it will put lives in danger and may destroy homes. \u201cThis fire will be uncontrollable, unpredictable and fast moving,\u201d the alert says. \u201cThick smoke and thousands of embers will cause fires all around you. Fires will move quickly and may come from many directions.\u201d The Tasmanian Fire Service (TFS) says the safest course of action is to evacuate now, but if you don\u2019t have a safe route to a safer place, shelter inside your home until the fire passes. Bairnsdale incident controller Ben Rankin updates reporters on bushfires in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland area. Rankin says the area is facing extreme fire danger. \u201cWe will get big column development today and quite significant runs of fire if anything breaks out of the control lines we\u2019ve currently got,\u201d Rankin says. He says a cool change expected around midnight will present its own challenges and may lead to new runs of fire. Hello, this is Helen Davidson with you again, for the rest of the day\u2019s live coverage of the bushfire situation across multiple states. A quick couple of stats via AAP on the Victorian fires. There are more than 10 burning in East Gippsland, including three that have been going for more than a month. Overnight 16 fires in the state were started by lightning strikes. One of them, which started between Cann River and Mallacoota, travelled 24km in six hours overnight, creating a 14km high plume and its own dry lightning. Water bombers have been deployed in Bundoora in Melbourne. An emergency warning has been issued for Bundoora, Greensborough and Mill Park in the suburbs of Melbourne The fire is threatening homes and lives. \u201cYou are in danger and need to act immediately to survive\u201d, the CFA says. \u201cThe safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately. It is too late to leave\u201d. \u201cThis message is for people at North of Metropolitan Ring Road between Scholar Drive And Booyan Court. There is a bushfire at Jubilee Cr, Mill Park that is not yet under control. \u201cThe bushfire is travelling from Jubilee Crescent in a southerly direction towards Cloverton Way. The fire started near Cloverton Way in Bundoora.\u201d Andrew Crisp, the Victorian emergency management commissioner, says a \u201clot of people\u201d stayed at Lakes Entrance. \u201cOn the other hand, we know there was quite long streams of traffic leaving East Gippsland yesterday afternoon and into the evening,\u201d he adds. He also says \u201cthese aren\u2019t the last of the warnings we\u2019ll see today. There\u2019ll be more coming out.\u201d Outside of East Gippsland, the major concerns for authorities are the fire at Lexton, west of Avoca, and the two in the Plenty Gorge, he says. Victorian emergency services minister Lisa Neville says it is likely that the Princes Highway \u201cwill fully close at some point to Bairnsdale right through to Mallacoota\u201d. \u201cThis is a warning to all Victorians,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is not yet over ... we\u2019re really only halfway through what is ahead of us here today.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a different kind of thunderstorm,\u201d says Andrew Tupper from the Bureau of Meteorology. These are known as pyro-cumulonimbus \u2013 which basically means a fire-generated thunderstorm. \u201cThe way that they work is basically the fires give them an extra push in conditions that would normally be suitable, or marginally suitable, for thunderstorms. As they give them that push, the thunderstorms can develop more rapidly than they normally would. \u201cThey carry fire embers aloft, which can help the spread of those fires, accelerate the spread of those fires, they can push those embers down with the severe wind gusts that the thunderstorms generate. And overall they can greatly contribute to unexpected fire spread in unexpected directions.\u201d Conditions are so dangerous, the fires are generating lightning, the CFA says. \u201cThe fire that started yesterday afternoon near Mallacoota is an excellent example about the fire behaviour that we\u2019ve seen. \u201cSo a fire that started mid to late afternoon, started to move towards the Princes Highway. The wind changed direction and, within four or five hours, that fire travelled all the way to the coast \u2013 about 24km. \u201cIt put up a column, punching into the atmosphere 14km high. We recently looked at the columns, and they\u2019re generating their own weather. There\u2019s lightning coming out of these columns. It is unpredictable, it\u2019s dangerous out there.\u201d Another press conference in Victoria. \u201cYou should not be on the roads\u201d in East Gippsland, authorities say. \u201cWe have the W Tree fire running towards the coast and we believe it could impact on the Princes Highway between 5pm and 7pm this evening. \u201cWe have been telling people for more than 24 hours East Gippsland is at significant risk in relation to fire. Earlier today, we changed our messaging to say that you should not be on the roads. \u201cYou need to follow, very, very closely, the instructions in those warnings. With those emergency warnings, a lot will say \u201cShelter in place\u201d but, at times, they will give you options of how you might be able to get out of that particular area.\u201d Another emergency warning has been issued for Burrowye, Cudgewa, Cudgewa North, Guys Forest, Mount Alfred, Pine Mountain, Tintaldra, Walwa. This fire is further away from the other eight fires in East Gippsland. The fire is 13km west-north-west of Walwa, travelling in a south-easterly direction towards Walwa. This bushfire could impact Walwa and surrounding towns any time in the next one hour. Murray River will be closed between Walwa and Burrowye. \u201cLeaving now is the safest option, before conditions become too dangerous,\u201d the CFA says. \u201cEmergency Services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay.\u201d And an update on the emergency warning for Goongerah, Martins Creek, Nurran, Sardine Creek and Errinundra. The fire is now impacting private property, according to the CFA. Meanwhile in NSW. Another emergency fire in Victoria \u2013 taking the count to eight right now. The new warning is for Bruthen, Bullumwaal, Clifton Creek, Deptford, Fairhope, Fairy Dell, Granite Rock, Mossiface, Mount Taylor, Sarsfield, Waterholes. \u201cYou are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately. It is too late to leave.\u201d At the same time, in NSW, an emergency warning has been issued for Dunns Road. From Tasmania: \u201cThere is another lightning storm forecast to come across today. It has a very serious, very serious risk of starting fires. We are concerned that the lightning ignitions will give us a lot of problems going forward.\u201d New fires should be reported via 000. Tasmanian fire authorities are also speaking now. In Strathgordon, an emergency alert has been issued for travellers and tourists, but not for residents. The fire remains at watch and act for residents. The two should not be confused, the TFS says. During that press conference, an emergency warning was also issued in South Australia for an area near the Playford Highway on Kangaroo Island. But that was downgraded to watch and act a few minutes ago. It will take \u201cweeks or months\u201d for the fires to be put out, the CFA says. \u201cAt this stage, substantial rain is what is required to bring these to a halt.\u201d That is not forecast in the near future. \u201cI think anyone now in Gippsland, who are seeing the columns out there and seeing the fires starting would know that it is a very risky day, and I\u2019m hoping that they will take the advice that has been given in the messages that are coming out from this service.\u201d The CFA says they have 14 aircraft operating on the Lakes Entrance fire at this stage. The CFA say that conditions will worsen in the next few hours. \u201cOver the next few hours we will see more of the spot fires developing and more of them are running down towards the south-east with the north-westerly wind behind them. We will see further runs of fire, quite some distances as we go into the afternoon\u201d. The forecast south-westerly wind will give them \u201ccontrol issues\u201d. But after that, they are hopeful that they will \u201csee a bit of a settling in the fire weather\u201d. The CFA is giving a press conference now in Bairnsdale. They say that towns in most danger are: Bruthen, Buchan and Buchan South, Goongerah (which has already been evacuated) and \u201cthe coastal strip across to Mallacoota\u201d. They say they are unaware of any impact on private land \u2013 so far only public land has been affected. Severe thunderstorms are forecast for South Australia and Tasmania \u2013 both have a risk of starting new fires. In Victoria, the southerly is on its way. An update on the Wingan River, Furnell, Tamboon South fire, which is at emergency level. The CFA advises that the Princes Highway is now closed from Bruthen through to the Genoa intersection. And the road north of Genoa to Eden remains open but may close at any time. The fire is currently approximately 20km east of Cann River. All roads into the warning area are closed including the West Wingan Road. Hobart has just registered its highest temperature in December on record. It hit 40.8C in the city at 1.47pm, before dropping to 39.8C. Marilyn Withers is sitting in her car with the air conditioner running in an attempt to cool down her dogs, Majic and Puku. The 77-year-old lives at Nicholson, about 20km east of Bairnsdale, but was told to leave the eight-acre property this morning by her son. He is planning to stay and defend. Withers is emotional at the thought of losing her house, where she lived for six years while caring for her husband. He died earlier this year and her son, Mitch, 57, has been staying with her since. \u201cIt is really tough, I didn\u2019t want to leave the house,\u201d Withers said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know really where to go. Really nobody is telling you where to go.\u201d She has packed her car with blankets, a few changes of clothes, and all her photo albums. A sun tent is set up next to the car, but it is being flattened by the wind. The towering plume of smoke from the Bruthen fire can be seen in the distance. Withers says she plans to go home tonight \u2013 provided the road is open. In the meantime she is wetting towels in the river in an attempt to keep her dogs cool. We have also updated our interactive map tracking the total amount of land burned this fire season. The new total is 4.6m hectares, across New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. An emergency warning has just been issued for Buchan, Buchan South and Sunny Point. That makes it seven emergency level fires burning at the same time in East Gippsland. The CFA advises that spot fires might be started by embers. \u201cThere is a bushfire to your west that is not yet under control. Fire activity has now increased and produced a significant smoke column. \u201cA severe thunder storm warning has been issued for East Gippsland for damaging and locally destructive winds. \u201cYou are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately. It is too late to leave.\u201d If you\u2019re mourning the lost fireworks, rapper Baker Boy has announced he is throwing a charity party today in Melbourne, after the heat and fire risk cancelled the Falls Festival in Lorne. All profits go to the CFA. Irene McCarthy and Hugh Hunter decided to pack their caravan and leave their home at Metung, on the East Gippsland coast, on Monday morning. They had been watching the fire building at Bruthen for the past few days and woke to the news of five more fires started in their area due to lightning strikes. \u201cOur community safer place is the Metung yacht and golf club,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cWe were told at the community meeting this morning that it would not be defended. And that was it for us\u2026 it was that which decided us on coming down here.\u201d They made the half-hour drive to Bairnsdale with their daughter and son-in-law, who are visiting from Melbourne, and pulled up at Howitt Park, on the Mitchell River, reckoning that it would be nicer than camping at the treeless football oval. A number of neighbours from Metung are there \u2013 it\u2019s a heavily wooded place. It is \u201cvery hot and very unpleasant\u201d, McCarthy said. She is sitting in the shade to escape the heat, but it\u2019s not working \u2013 she has to put her head between her knees. She and Hunter moved from the UK 12 years ago. \u201cMost of the time we absolutely love it,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cLast night was not one of those \u2018love it\u2019 nights.\u201d They have considered the possibility that they might lose the house. \u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s just a house,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cWhat will be will be.\u201d More road closures. Every state has now hit 40C temperatures. And that includes Tasmania, with an astonishing maximum of 40.2C. Fires are also burning in Tasmania, and storms have been forecast that could start even more with lightning strikes. This is Naaman Zhou taking over the blog from Helen Davidson. Sky News is reporting that all fireworks displays in East Gippsland have been cancelled for tomorrow night\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve. The CFA has just declared more emergency level fires in the East Gippsland area. These are the latest updates from the CFA in the last 10 minutes, adding to previous updates about emergency fires near Goongerah, Butchers Ridge, Reedy Flat and Suggan Buggan. Wingan River This fire has increased rapidly in size, and is out of control. It is approximately 20km east of Cann River with easterly winds putting pressure on the western side of the fire. The warning applies to Furnell, Tamboon South and Wingan River. Ramrod Creek A bushfire north of Bruthen is out of control. It\u2019s travelling south from Boys Camp Road towards Ramrod Creek, and could impact within the next hour. Leaving now is the safest option. Edit: This post has been edited to remove a reference to evacuation orders for Goongerah and Martins Creek. The current CFA warnings say it is too late to leave and the safest option is to take shelter indoors. The Princes Highway is also now closed between Cann River and the Genoa intersection. Do not head north from Cann River on the Princes Highway if you are travelling. This is Helen Davidson taking over the blog from Luke Henriques-Gomes. An emergency warning has been issued for Goongerah, Martins Creek, Sardine Creek, Errinundra and Nurran, where it is too late to leave and the safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately. This is an upgrade in severity from the watch and act warning issued this morning. The CFA says the bushfire, which is west of Goongerah and south-west of Bonang, remains out of control and fire activity is increasing. There are two significant columns building in the south-eastern corner of the fire, heading towards Goongerah and Martins Creek. The fire is threatening homes and lives. Some temperatures in the East Gippsland region so far today: Orbost was recorded at 43.1C at 12.15pm, while Bairnsdale was at 42.1C at 12.25pm. An updated emergency alert has been issued for Reedy Flat, Tambo Crossing, Wattle Circle and Ensay South. Lives and homes are under threat. The fire north-west of Tambo Crossing is out of control. This fire is moving in a south-easterly direction towards Tambo Crossing and Wattle Circle and is likely to impact these communities any time between 12pm and 2pm today. It is too late to leave. This fire is threatening homes and lives. You are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately. It is too late to leave. This fire will cross the Great Alpine Road and residents in Tambo Crossing and Wattle Circle should NOT travel north towards Swifts Creek. Photographer Chris Hopkins is travelling with our reporter Calla Wahlquist today. He took these images of emergency service workers and evacuated families in Bairnsdale, just to the west of the threatened region of East Gippsland. About 1,000 firefighters, a mixture of department and CFA volunteers, had been positioned at strategic locations around East Gippsland today and tasked with protecting key assets and communities. It was too dangerous to send firefighters into the forest itself. Rankin said that not all of the properties and small towns throughout East Gippsland were \u201cfully defendable\u201d and if the fire behaved in a particularly aggressive way even towns like Metung could be at risk. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make judgments about specific towns because if the fire behaves really aggressively it could move more into towns.\u201d He advised everyone in the East Gippsland and Gippsland area to listen to ABC local radio, keep on top of fire alerts, and follow their bushfire safety plan. The Gippsland fires are being managed by Delwp because they are primarily on crown land. Firefighters in lime green overalls, many of whom have taken on the role as a summer job from university, are leaving the centre in groups holding biodegradable plastic bags filled with provisions. The incident controller Ben Rankin said the conditions were \u201cquite extreme\u201d for Gippsland, \u201ccomparable almost to Black Saturday in some ways, if the forecast does eventuate as given to us\u201d. The text message sent to everyone in East Gippsland on Sunday, telling them to get out, angered some locals and had been ignored by some tourists. Rankin said that larger tourist towns \u2013 like Lakes Entrance itself, not the parks or small campgrounds surrounding it \u2013 would be a \u201crelatively safe place to go today\u201d. He said the warning was issued to ensure people knew the risk and that people remained off the road on Monday afternoon and evening, when it was likely fires would cut off the Princes Highway. \u201cIf we get through today and we don\u2019t have a significant fire run within this area I am speaking of in East Gippsland, we would be very fortunate.\u201d The perimeter of the largest fires in East Gippsland is more than 1,000km long and any area near that perimeter should be considered a risk today, authorities say. \u201cI think it\u2019s inevitable that there will be some significant run of fire today,\u201d said the Gippsland fires incident controller Ben Rankin. \u201cWhere that occurs we will have to react to that as best we can. There is a large perimeter of fire, well over 1,000km of fire perimeter, and on a day like today none of it can be guaranteed to be safe. \u201cThere is a risk that it would run, and already we are starting to see a significant buildup of some of the fires now, and in the next hour or two we will start to see some movement I would think.\u201d Rankin addressed local media outside the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (Delwp) headquarters in Bairnsdale a short time ago. As we hit midday, here is what we know so far: There are now four emergency alerts and four watch and act alerts in place in Victoria\u2019s east. Holidaymakers in East Gippsland were warned to leave before 9am today, but some have stayed. A fire at Mallacoota is generating its own lightning, while two bushfires near Ensay and Tambo Crossing merged and remain very active. In South Australia, firefighters are battling catastrophic fire conditions in the Adelaide Hills, mid-north and Yorke Peninsula. Hobart is tipped to reach 40C, as Tasmania also braces for a day of fire danger. Another emergency warning has been issued in Victoria, this time for Suggan Buggan. That is in the Alpine region, right on the border with NSW. Emergency Services Victoria says: There is a bushfire at 5km north of Suggan Buggan that is not yet under control. This fire is becoming increasingly active and travelling south. There is also a fire in NSW 13km north of Suggan Buggan moving south towards Victoria that has produced a significant smoke column. This was the scene at a fire at Cabbage Tree Creek yesterday. A new emergency warning is in place in Gelantipy, Wulgulmerang, Wulgulmerang East. Those are townships in East Gippsland. The CFA says: There is a bushfire 5 km west of Wulgulmerang that is not yet under control. It is too late to leave, this fire is moving rapidly. This fire is threatening homes and lives. \u201cYou are in danger and need to act immediately to survive.\u201d Over in NSW, the deputy premier, John Barilaro, has called for Sydney\u2019s NYE fireworks display to be cancelled. The Nationals leader has shared that view in a tweet posted this morning. It puts him at odds with the City of Sydney, which says the fireworks will proceed, and the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, who has also said they should go ahead unless the NSW RFS says otherwise. Some more from AAP. Some communities have decided to cancel or postpone their fireworks displays, including Armidale in the state\u2019s north and Huskisson on the state\u2019s south. More than 250,000 people have signed a petition calling for the Sydney fireworks to be scrapped, with funding redirected to drought and bushfire relief. The city\u2019s famous celebrations are expected to attract one million people to the harbour foreshore and generate $130 million for the NSW economy. Just to follow up the fire at Mallacoota that is generating its own lightning. Guardian Australia environment reporter Graham Redfearn put together this piece on Pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCB) this month. About a dozen holiday makers with caravans and tents have set up temporarily in Howitt Park, Bairnsdale, after being advised to leave East Gippsland. Among them are Craig Anderson and Brendan Gaffey and their families. They had been camping at Kalimna near Lakes Entrance since Saturday and are hoping to return tomorrow to finish their week-long holiday before returning to Melbourne. \u201cToday is the only day that is forecast to be really bad,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cHopefully if it doesn\u2019t go terribly we can go back.\u201d Anderson said there were still some people at the caravan park at Kalimna when they left this morning, including a number of permanent residents. He and Gaffey and their families decided not to risk it. \u201cIf the highway is closed we would rather be on this side of it,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe had wanted to come into Bairnsdale anyway to do a bit of shopping, and we thought we may as well just do that and bring our gear with us just in case.\u201d Here is some more information about this from the Bom website: Pyrocumulonimbus clouds are a thunderstorm that forms in the smoke plume of a fire (or nuclear bomb blast, or volcanic ash cloud). In Australia they most commonly form in large and intense bushfire smoke plumes. (The official name for clouds that form this way is \u2018flammagenitus\u2019, but they\u2019re commonly known as pyrocumulonimbus.) I\u2019ve been chatting with the author and journalist Lucie Morris-Marr, who has been sharing updates from Gippsland at @luciemorrismarr on Twitter. Morris-Marr was holidaying with her family at Metung, East Gippsland and received the evacuation warning text message. She left with her family this morning, but others have decided to stay. We were all seeing the warnings on phones and TV but the local shop keepers etc were being very laidback and saying they didn\u2019t think Metung was in danger,\u201d Morris-Marr says. So I felt many tourists were being guided by what the view was on the ground. Many had paid for apartments and travelled from as far as Bendigo and just didn\u2019t want the hassle of packing up. I\u2019ve covered bushfires in my career as a reporter, and I\u2019ll never forget going into the Wye River on Boxing Day in 2015 after a fire destroyed nearly the whole area and multiple houses. Fire behaviour is so unpredictable and it\u2019s just not worth the risk. Just because you are near the beach or a lake system doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re immune. Some tourists in our resort in Metung said their plan if the fire hit was to escape by boat.\u201d Calla is on the road in Gippsland with photographer Chris Hopkins. You\u2019ll remember the Victorian emergency services commissioner Andrew Crisp said those looking to evacuate should do so before 9am. Calla tells me there are not too many cars on the road where she is. My colleague Ben Smee has this story today about the push to declare a climate emergency. It\u2019s definitely worth a read. Ben writes: \u201cIn Australia, as ever when it comes to climate policy, the process has been polarising and frustrating.\u201d The Marlo Hotel is on the mouth of the Snowy River, near Orbost. It\u2019s in the middle of the \u201cleave now\u201d area in East Gippsland. But Pete, who works at the hotel, said that locals who received the warning text thought it was \u201ca bit of a joke\u201d. It\u2019s a bit like the boy who cried wolf,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the authorities are bedevilled if they do and bedevilled if they don\u2019t. If they don\u2019t tell people to get out and there\u2019s another fire, and everyone tries to evacuate at once, that will be a problem.\u201d The hotel has had a few cancellations, and some tourists have said they are leaving. The impact on local businesses could be severe. \u201cThis is the time of year where local businesses make their money,\u201d he said. \u201cMore often than not it\u2019s enough to get them through the quiet winter months to the next summer.\u201d I\u2019ve had a look at some temperature observations across Victoria and SA. At 9am, it was 37.5C in the Victorian town of Swan Hill, and 36.9C at Orbost in East Gippsland. In South Australia, it hit 38C at Port Augusta in 8.45am. Meanwhile, large parts of NSW are still burning. Severe fire danger is forecast for the state\u2019s south. Earlier on the ABC, the SA Country Fire Service\u2019s chief officer Brenton Eden discussed the day\u2019s conditions. He says the state will face a \u201cdangerous short duration event of catastrophic fire weather\u201d. Already, strong winds are causing havoc. The Cudlee Creek fire, which has been burning for four days, is sending out embers and causing trees to collapse. If you\u2019re thinking of doing your bushfire survival plan, stop thinking \u2013 do it now. The events of the day will be early. They will be before lunch. If you are not in a safe place, move to a safer place now and allow the fire service to combat whatever incidents arise. Chris Eagle, the incident controller for the East Gippsland fires, has just spoken on ABC Gippsland. He said the fire at Cann River, which is the cause of that emergency warning at Mallacoota, moved 24km in just six hours overnight. It is now just 5km south of the Princes Highway. When the wind changes from the northwest to the southwest the highway is likely to be cut off. That wind change will reach Sale at 10pm, Bairnsdale at 11.30pm and Mallacoota near midnight. The smoke column for the Cann River fire is 14km high and making its own weather, Eagle said. That includes its own lightning. Twelve new fires started on the Victorian side of the border overnight, and 10 in NSW that could be pushed south. Firefighters have been working on a control line on the southern side of the Marthavale/Bruthen fire, which has joined up to make a 105,000ha u-shaped blaze. Eagle said they should be able to hold at least parts of that containment line today. Efforts will be concentrated on holding that line, not battling the front itself. \u201cThis is not the day where we are going to pit firefighters in front of the fire,\u201d he said. Yesterday, organisers of the annual Falls Festival cancelled the multi-date event at Lorne, on Victoria\u2019s Surf Coast. There were some hastily organised shows last night in Melbourne and a few are also scheduled for today. Overseas artists Halsey, Yungblud as well as local favourites Peking Duk said they would donate proceeds from their shows to Victoria\u2019s Country Fire Authority. This is from yesterday. Swathes of southern Tasmania are tipped to reach 40C today. The BOM says the state\u2019s heat record is 42.2C at Scamander in 2013. Tasmania is also expecting a day of fire danger today. AAP has filed this report. Tasmanians have been urged to remain alert to fire risks as the state faces 40C temperatures in southern and eastern areas. Hobart is forecast to reach 40C and Launceston is expecting a maximum temperature of 34C on Monday, with thunderstorms and wind gusts of 80 to 90km/h also forecast. The forecast combination of heat, thunderstorms and wind gusts have triggered extreme and severe fire dangers warnings across the state. \u201cA total fire ban has been declared across the state and is set to continue until Tuesday morning,\u201d emergency management minister Mark Shelton said. \u201cPeople are being urged to remain vigilant. It is vital that people know what to do if a fire threatens their home or property.\u201d Tasmanians were also encouraged to have a plan to keep in touch with older or sick relatives, friends and neighbours. Tasmania Fire Services recommended people living in bushland areas to relocate to urban areas for Monday, and campers to reconsider their plans. \u201cAs far as the fire danger goes, tomorrow has the potential to be a very bad day across large parts of the state,\u201d Tasmania Fire Service chief officer Chris Arnol said. \u201cAlthough Tasmania\u2019s fire agencies are well prepared, people can\u2019t expect to see a fire truck in every driveway and an aircraft above every house.\u201d I mentioned earlier that there are warnings for catastrophic bushfire conditions in place today in SA. Those have been issued for Yorke Peninsula, Kangaroo Island and Mount Lofty Ranges. Winds will likely exceed 90kmh in Maitland, Kingscote, Victor Harbor, Ardrossan and Warooka. Conditions are expected to mirror those that sparked blazes in the Adelaide Hills and Kangaroo Island recently. Residents of the tiny village of Goongerah, on the Brodribb River, were ordered to evacuate on Saturday. It is in the path of three major fires and sandwiched between the Snowy River National Park and Errinundra National Park. Most residents heeded that warning. But some, like Jill Redwood, who lives with two dogs, two Clydesdales and a few goats on an off-the-grid property just outside the village, are staying. \u201cWe have been told there won\u2019t be any emergency services in Goongerah, there won\u2019t be any strike teams here,\u201d Redwood said. \u201cWe will just be on our own. It\u2019s too dangerous. And in the worst case scenario we could be cut off for three weeks.\u201d The local CFA fire truck will be in the area but Redwood said there may not be anyone left to man it, because \u201cwe will all be defending our own properties\u201d. Redwood has dealt with fire before. She has been a CFA volunteer for 20 years, done a stint on a fire tower, and defended her home at Goongerah against fires in 1983 and 2014. In both cases, the fire just missed her. She said she has been preparing her property for two weeks and believes it is defendable. Her horses have lived through a bushfire before, and remained calm. In a worst case scenario, she said, she has a fire bunker (or \u201cglorified wombat hole\u201d) or will retreat to the dam or the river, both of which still have water in them. \u201cIt is probably going to be a bad one, maybe worse than I have experienced before,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I survive the day \u2014 well, hopefully I will. I might end up a stick of charcoal but I will do my best not to.\u201d Crisp says a cool change forecast for today will hit Melbourne about 7pm but won\u2019t reach the fire grounds until midnight. \u201cThat has the potential to create huge issues for us because we\u2019ll have north-easterly winds pushing the fires down towards the coast,\u201d he says. This is a high risk day for Victoria, it is a day we don\u2019t often see. The state is dry and it is going to be very hot and windy. People, get out now. If you don\u2019t, you have got to stay across the conditions and listen to the warnings during the day. Crisp says many people have left the area but that a lot of tourists and holiday makers have remained. Asked when it would be too late to leave, Crisp says 9am. \u201cIf you\u2019re not out by 9am there is every chance you won\u2019t be able to leave,\u201d Crisp says. \u201cWe had a new fire near Cann River and had to close the Princes Highway for three hours. It is an example of what could happen today.\u201d My colleague Calla Wahlquist is on the ground in East Gippsland and has filed her first dispatch. I will bring that to you shortly. But first, Victoria\u2019s emergency services commissioner, Andrew Crisp is speaking on the ABC. Let\u2019s take a look at where warnings are already in place, starting in Victoria. The area of East Gippsland, east of Melbourne, is a focus for Victorian authorities today. Yesterday, about 40,000 people were urged to leave the area ahead of extreme fire danger today. It is expected that three fires that burned over night will expand today. The evacuation took place because authorities believe they may need to close the Princes Highway, meaning people would be left without a route to leave. A total fire ban is in place across the state and temperatures will soar above 40C. The fire danger is rated as extreme in the Mallee, Wimmera, south-west, central, north-central and Northern Country districts and severe in East Gippsland and the north-east. Below are the emergency warnings currently in place. Good morning. I\u2019m Luke Henriques-Gomes. Thanks for joining us today for what is expected to be another dangerous summer day, with catastrophic conditions forecast in parts of South Australia and an extreme rating issued for Victoria. Later in the day, we will turn our attention to Western Australia, where dangerous conditions are also predicted. And in New South Wales, where dozens of fires are still burning, very high to severe warnings are in place in parts of the state.",

Among those employed by Dallas are a young quarterback who topped 4,900 yards this season, an elite rusher who topped 1,000 yards, two 1,100-yard receivers, a stout offensive line still in its prime and a top 10 defense. It\u2019s stunning that this team only finished 8-8, especially given they were largely healthy. The playoff-bound Eagles, on the other hand, have been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricSFensty/status/1211445373769834496?s=20\">famously ravaged by injuries</a> this season. Coaching was the difference-maker, especially on game day, and Garrett has consistently proven that he is not the person who should be leading Dallas into the next decade.</p> <p>Who that utopian person may be is not as simple as the sexiest name on the market, or the next Sean McVay or whatever hotshot coach downtrodden teams want to recreate. If Dallas were a normal franchise with a separate owner and separate GM and separate head of player personnel and even a separate team spokesman, who wouldn\u2019t want to sign for the Cowboys experience? These players are largely top-flight and young and play in a division that isn\u2019t hyper-competitive at the moment. How did they go 8-8 again?</p> <p>Unfortunately, almost everything Cowboys-related continues to be run by 77-year old Jerry Jones. While his son, executive vice president Stephen Jones, has a voice and seems to grasp modern football personnel, the patriarch continues in his role as the general manager. Jones picks the players he believes best fit his coaches\u2019 schemes, not who the coaches tell him best fits. Jones decides if some controversial pariah like Greg Hardy gets to be a Cowboy. Jones holds court for the media after every game, picking apart his likes and dislikes, sharing injury news and other matters reserved for the coach in the other 31 franchises. The recent result of Jones as a general manager has been a scant three playoff appearances in 10 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/29/nfl-week-17-scores-patriots-dolphins\">NFL round-up: Patriots passed by Chiefs for bye after shock Dolphins loss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What reputable coach is going to want to work under those smothering conditions?</p> <p>The Cowboys co-existed with Garrett for nine <em>blah</em> years because he was groomed for the role starting with his days as a back-up quarterback in Dallas. Garrett was in many ways like another son to Jones. He accepted Jones\u2019s unusual power grab, smiling and waving along the way while never having a legitimate opportunity to put his own stamp on the organization. Jones relished the loyalty and was fond enough of Garrett to keep him around for several years, drowning out the NFL zeitgeist who called for his firing year after year.</p> <p>This year\u2019s head coach candidate pool is not as splashy as recent years when guys like McVay and Kyle Shanahan were quickly poached.

Perhaps Jones will surprise and make a run at a coach he trusts can immediately deliver a Super Bowl. Sean Payton\u2019s name has been attached to Dallas in the past. Payton recently signed a contract extension but with draft picks and enough cash, anything is possible.</p> <p>While Payton or any other current coach is a longshot, Jones is going to need a real epiphany to get this team to be the perennial Super Bowl contender it should be. He needs to step down as general manager and either appoint his son or hire an outside voice that doesn\u2019t share his DNA. He needs to give his new coach a real stake and allow them to build a culture and a football side blueprint without Big Brother watching over him.

But throughout the season and on Sunday, Christian McCaffery continued to be a revelation who is redefining the running back position. His 72 receiving yards put him in the elite 1,000-1,000 club.

Though hardly Fitzgerald\u2019s finest statistical season, the 36-year-old was rejuvenated this year sharing a field with dynamic rookie QB Kyler Murray. But Fitzgerald is an unrestricted free agent in 2020 so we may have played his last game in a Cardinals jersey.</p> <p>\u2022 With some teams playing for nothing in particular and others needing an offensive jump start, Week 17 had quite the array of trick plays.

The 38-year-old is scheduled to be a free agent and has said he\u2019s open to playing for another team. Elsewhere around the league \u2022 The Carolina Panthers ended their disappointing 2019 campaign with another thud, losing 42-10 to the Saints. But throughout the season and on Sunday, Christian McCaffery continued to be a revelation who is redefining the running back position. His 72 receiving yards put him in the elite 1,000-1,000 club. McCaffrey is just the third rusher to collect over 1,000 yards on the ground and through the air, joining Roger Craig (1985) and Marshall Faulk (1999). \u2022 The Tennessee Titans secured the AFC\u2019s No 6 seed with a 35-14 win over the Houston Texans on the heels of three rushing touchdowns by Derrick Henry. Mike Vrabel will take his Titans to Foxboro to face his former team in next week\u2019s wild-card round. The Titans beat the Patriots in 2018. \u2022 Larry Fitzgerald played in his 250th career game, the most by any wide receiver with one team. Though hardly Fitzgerald\u2019s finest statistical season, the 36-year-old was rejuvenated this year sharing a field with dynamic rookie QB Kyler Murray. But Fitzgerald is an unrestricted free agent in 2020 so we may have played his last game in a Cardinals jersey. \u2022 With some teams playing for nothing in particular and others needing an offensive jump start, Week 17 had quite the array of trick plays. From the Falcons sending RT Ty Sambrailo up the seam for a 35-yd touchdown to Lions QB David Blough catching a touchdown from Danny Amendola after a reverse to Tom Brady finding LB Elandon Roberts for a touchdown, there are some new names to consider for next year\u2019s fantasy rosters.",

China, it daringly predicted, would be on the verge of Olympic rugby sevens gold. Snooker would be dead, Formula One on life support. Oh, and Cristiano Ronaldo would have a team named after him. True, the much-missed magazine got a few things right, including boxing\u2019s renaissance, but its January 2010 issue mainly served to highlight the perils of being a sporting soothsayer. So, with that in mind, it\u2019s time to polish my own crystal ball, cross my fingers, and offer up some guesses for 2020 and beyond.</p> \n<h2><strong>Team GB will fall short of their grand ambitions at the Tokyo Olympics and that\u2019s OK</strong></h2> \n<p>At the 2016 Rio Games, Team GB did what pretty much everyone thought was impossible by bettering their London 2012 performance, with a staggering 27 golds and 67 podium finishes lifting them to second in the medal table. Yet, incredibly, UK Sport\u2019s performance director, Chelsea Warr, is \u201cquietly confident\u201d Britain can do even better in Tokyo.</p> \n<p>I can\u2019t see it. Yes, UK Sport\u2019s budget and tech resources remain the envy of the world, and such as Adam Peaty, Dina Asher-Smith and Laura Kenny are likely to be multiple medallists. But <a href=\"https://www.gracenote.com/virtual-medal-table/\" title=\"\">most experts believe a drop-off</a> is more likely given the rise of China and Japan. And do you know what? If GB\u2019s medal haul ends up being closer to 50 than 70 we should be intensely relaxed about it. There will still be enough ra-ra to go round. Honour will be satisfied. And given spending millions on elite sport doesn\u2019t drive participation levels, whether Team GB come second or fifth in the medal table will have little discernible effect on the wider population.</p> \n<h2><strong>More Russians will compete in Tokyo than in Rio</strong></h2> \n<p>When is an Olympic ban not an Olympic ban? When it involves Russia. Barring a fresh doping bust I expect hundreds of Russian athletes will be cleared to compete in Tokyo, despite the country\u2019s recent global ban.

Given Hubbard finished fourth in the 87kg+ snatch competition at the 2019 world championships, a medal could be even on the cards. Whatever happens, expect the thorny issue of transgender athletes to get even more pointed in the 2020s \u2013 with the policies of governing bodies, who are trying to juggle \u201cfairness\u201d with \u201cinclusivity\u201d, being increasingly challenged in the courts. How much the emerging scientific evidence informs the debate is another intriguing factor.</p> \n<h2><strong>England may have more success after Euro 2020 than during it</strong></h2> \n<p>Are Gareth Southgate\u2019s side capable of winning Euro 2020? Of course. Should they be the bookies\u2019 favourites? Hmm, maybe.

      "body": "<p>The 19 mutilated bodies, nine hanging semi-naked from a bridge in the Mexican city of Uruapan, were initially thought to be the result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/08/mexico-bodies-police-uruapan-drug-cartels\">a clash between rival drug gangs</a>. But the Jalisco New Generation cartel, which claimed the murders in August, is believed to be fighting for more than drugs. It wants dominance over the local avocado trade.</p> <p>Mexico is the world\u2019s biggest producer of avocados. Exports of the \u201cgreen gold\u201d from the state of Michoac\u00e1n, which produces most of Mexico\u2019s avocados, were worth $2.4bn last year.</p> <p>Now, the risk analytics group Verisk Maplecroft has warned <a href=\"https://www.maplecroft.com/insights/analysis/are-mexican-avocados-the-next-conflict-commodity/\">in a new analysis</a> that Mexican avocados risk becoming the next \u201cconflict commodity\u201d, akin to \u201cblood diamonds\u201d in Angola and Sierra Leone and conflict minerals in the Democractic Republic of the Congo.</p> <p>The analysis examines a range of factors contributing to the increasing risk profile of Mexican avocados, including the growing involvement of cartels and the associated violence, as well as the use of forced and child labour in farming.</p> <p>It also examines illegal deforestation, illegal logging and forest-clearing for cultivation. The environmental situation has been exacerbated due to cartel activity, \u201cas criminal groups clear protected woodlands to make room for their avocado groves\u201d, according to the report.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"269b0e6aba0599c4b2b4f94e18be1fbf06f081a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/269b0e6aba0599c4b2b4f94e18be1fbf06f081a0/0_0_4624_2821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An avocado sculpture at the entrance to the town of Tanc\u00edtaro, Michoac\u00e1n state, Mexico.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"610\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An avocado sculpture at the entrance to the town of Tanc\u00edtaro, Michoac\u00e1n state, Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Ugarte/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe exponential growth of the avocado\u2019s popularity is a mixed blessing for Mexico\u2019s communities and farmers,\u201d Verisk Maplecroft\u2019s Americas analyst, Christian Wagner, says in the report. \u201cWhile most have benefited from record-breaking prices, many have attracted the attention of organised crime groups that are sinking their teeth into the profits.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cFrom cultivation through to transportation, violence and corruption now pervade Mexico\u2019s avocado supply chain \u2013 particularly in Michoaca\u0301n, a long-standing hotbed for criminal violence. The similarities with conflict minerals are striking for companies that source avocados from the region. Association with killings, modern slavery, child labour and environmental degradation is becoming an increasing risk when dealing with Michoaca\u0301n suppliers and growers, especially when establishing traceability is increasingly hard.\u201d</p> <p>Avocados have been lauded by dieticians for their high nutritional content and \u201cgood\u201d fats. In Mexico, the industry is popular because it pays up to 12 times the Mexican minimum wage, according to the study. The country tops the list of world exporters, ahead of the Netherlands, a major non-producing exporting hub, and Peru.</p> <p>Most of Mexico\u2019s avocados go to the US, despite domestic production in California and Florida. Avocados in UK supermarkets mostly come from Spain, Israel, South Africa, Peru and Chile. The fruit is also in high demand in China, which <a href=\"https://www.producereport.com/article/2017-year-review-china%E2%80%99s-avocado-market\">imported </a><a href=\"https://www.producereport.com/article/2017-year-review-china%E2%80%99s-avocado-market\">1,000 times</a><a href=\"https://www.producereport.com/article/2017-year-review-china%E2%80%99s-avocado-market\"> more of the product in 2017 </a><a href=\"https://www.producereport.com/article/2017-year-review-china%E2%80%99s-avocado-market\">than it had six years earlier</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"49cafa0337a76542bcc172a0a9128e1b194ed874\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49cafa0337a76542bcc172a0a9128e1b194ed874/0_277_5253_3152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Avocado orchards stretch far into the mountains in Michoaca\u0301n state.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avocado orchards stretch far into the mountains in Michoaca\u0301n state.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Ugarte/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Europe\u2019s consumption of avocado stands at 1kg per person per year, according to the Netherlands\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.cbi.eu/market-information/fresh-fruit-vegetables/avocados/europe/\">Centre for the Promotion of Imports</a>, while the US consumes four times as much. France is the fruit\u2019s largest market in Europe.</p> <p>In Mexico, the cartels have turned to other activities, most notably avocados, in the face of the government\u2019s tightening war on drugs, Verisk Maplecroft\u2019s Wagner said. They engage \u201cin both extortion and direct cultivation, usually on lands taken over from local farmers or carved out from protected woodlands\u201d.</p> <p>The study notes that \u201c2019 has seen the rise of criminal organisations that behave in every way as drug cartels but are not even engaged in drug trafficking. In Michoaca\u0301n, the avocado industry is providing the diversified income that criminal groups obtain through fuel theft elsewhere in Mexico.\u201d</p> <p>At least 12 criminal groups are operating in the region. Some local packers and growers have responded by recruiting their own defence forces.

      "bodyText": "The 19 mutilated bodies, nine hanging semi-naked from a bridge in the Mexican city of Uruapan, were initially thought to be the result of a clash between rival drug gangs. But the Jalisco New Generation cartel, which claimed the murders in August, is believed to be fighting for more than drugs. It wants dominance over the local avocado trade. Mexico is the world\u2019s biggest producer of avocados. Exports of the \u201cgreen gold\u201d from the state of Michoac\u00e1n, which produces most of Mexico\u2019s avocados, were worth $2.4bn last year. Now, the risk analytics group Verisk Maplecroft has warned in a new analysis that Mexican avocados risk becoming the next \u201cconflict commodity\u201d, akin to \u201cblood diamonds\u201d in Angola and Sierra Leone and conflict minerals in the Democractic Republic of the Congo. The analysis examines a range of factors contributing to the increasing risk profile of Mexican avocados, including the growing involvement of cartels and the associated violence, as well as the use of forced and child labour in farming. It also examines illegal deforestation, illegal logging and forest-clearing for cultivation. The environmental situation has been exacerbated due to cartel activity, \u201cas criminal groups clear protected woodlands to make room for their avocado groves\u201d, according to the report. \u201cThe exponential growth of the avocado\u2019s popularity is a mixed blessing for Mexico\u2019s communities and farmers,\u201d Verisk Maplecroft\u2019s Americas analyst, Christian Wagner, says in the report. \u201cWhile most have benefited from record-breaking prices, many have attracted the attention of organised crime groups that are sinking their teeth into the profits.\u201d He adds: \u201cFrom cultivation through to transportation, violence and corruption now pervade Mexico\u2019s avocado supply chain \u2013 particularly in Michoaca\u0301n, a long-standing hotbed for criminal violence. The similarities with conflict minerals are striking for companies that source avocados from the region. Association with killings, modern slavery, child labour and environmental degradation is becoming an increasing risk when dealing with Michoaca\u0301n suppliers and growers, especially when establishing traceability is increasingly hard.\u201d Avocados have been lauded by dieticians for their high nutritional content and \u201cgood\u201d fats. In Mexico, the industry is popular because it pays up to 12 times the Mexican minimum wage, according to the study. The country tops the list of world exporters, ahead of the Netherlands, a major non-producing exporting hub, and Peru. Most of Mexico\u2019s avocados go to the US, despite domestic production in California and Florida. Avocados in UK supermarkets mostly come from Spain, Israel, South Africa, Peru and Chile. The fruit is also in high demand in China, which imported 1,000 times more of the product in 2017 than it had six years earlier. Europe\u2019s consumption of avocado stands at 1kg per person per year, according to the Netherlands\u2019 Centre for the Promotion of Imports, while the US consumes four times as much. France is the fruit\u2019s largest market in Europe. In Mexico, the cartels have turned to other activities, most notably avocados, in the face of the government\u2019s tightening war on drugs, Verisk Maplecroft\u2019s Wagner said. They engage \u201cin both extortion and direct cultivation, usually on lands taken over from local farmers or carved out from protected woodlands\u201d. The study notes that \u201c2019 has seen the rise of criminal organisations that behave in every way as drug cartels but are not even engaged in drug trafficking. In Michoaca\u0301n, the avocado industry is providing the diversified income that criminal groups obtain through fuel theft elsewhere in Mexico.\u201d At least 12 criminal groups are operating in the region. Some local packers and growers have responded by recruiting their own defence forces. But \u201cthis increases the risk of both more violence and the potential for human rights abuses\u201d, says the report, and criminal groups often coerce pickers into temporary forced labour. Falko Ernst, International Crisis Group senior analyst for Mexico, said avocados have been a prominent item in Mexican organised crime groups\u2019 portfolio for at least a decade, especially in Michoac\u00e1n. \u201cIt\u2019s not only avocados. Mexican organised crime has long mutated away from \u2018just\u2019 drugs trafficking,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, the model is this: you control a given territory, and within in it you exploit whichever commodity is locally available. That includes avocados, but also limes, papayas, strawberries, illegal logging and mining, to name but a few.\u201d Ernst said a boycott of Mexican avocado is not the right response because \u201cwe\u2019re talking about a huge sector that sustains thousands of hard-working, peaceful families. A boycott would mean pulling out the rug out from under their feet, and most likely prompt criminal groups to prey on civilians more aggressively yet to make up for lost avocado income.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat consumers can and should do is voice their expectations toward the companies they buy goods from, to not remain silent bystanders to human rights crises in many of the producing regions in the global south.

      "body": "<p>The problem, getting ever harder, is what to leave out. For those who just think I\u2019m feeling sorry for myself, let me remind you of 1979, a year often cited as a high point in British television.</p> <p>Among the delights \u2013 this is not me, this is Wikipedia \u2013 were <em>Quatermass</em>, the finale of <em>Fawlty </em><em>Towers</em>, and the debuts of <em>Minder</em>, of <em>To the Manor </em><em>Born</em> and of <em>Thomas </em><em>&amp; Sarah</em>, a failed <em>Upstairs, Downstairs</em> spin-off. BBC2 launched an \u201cident\u201d and half the televisual world was on strike. And I could have compiled a list of 10 best back then in two shakes of a damp parka.</p> <p>Now we have the true glory years. Competition between streaming and terrestrial has never been more intense, nor competition between film and television for talent. We are, in short, being spoilt damn rotten, we greedy, needy children.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My beloved Endeavour has dropped from the top 10 list, despite one of my favourite lines of the year</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A major player, of course, has been the BBC. Let me attempt to mount a full-throated defence. We should be clutching that corporation as close to our hearts as the NHS. And, similarly, it has savage problems. Somehow, despite being among the most ardently woke of any British institution, ever, it managed to embroil itself in a gender pay row. I have no hesitation in blaming top-heavy, vole-in-the-headlights management.</p> <p>I have no hesitation either in celebrating the wonderful giftings to us throughout the year of producers, writers, stars, cameramen, production designers and makeup chaps and the rest, all handed to us for 365 days a year for, essentially, the price of a middling coffee maker on Amazon. And then there\u2019s free radio all year, telling us about everything. The corporation is infuriating, not least when it feels the wheedling need to advertise itself (badly, smugly): but it\u2019s what we\u2019ve got and I\u2019m proud and grateful.</p> <p>Streaming has come of age, settled down somewhat. You tend to grow to know what you\u2019re going to binge on, rather than graze. And it has produced some true marvels.</p> <p>I\u2019ve found myself having to leave out from my top 10 many wonderful fantasies. <em>His Dark Materials</em>, <em>Game of Thrones</em>.

      "bodyText": "The problem, getting ever harder, is what to leave out. For those who just think I\u2019m feeling sorry for myself, let me remind you of 1979, a year often cited as a high point in British television. Among the delights \u2013 this is not me, this is Wikipedia \u2013 were Quatermass, the finale of Fawlty Towers, and the debuts of Minder, of To the Manor Born and of Thomas &amp; Sarah, a failed Upstairs, Downstairs spin-off. BBC2 launched an \u201cident\u201d and half the televisual world was on strike. And I could have compiled a list of 10 best back then in two shakes of a damp parka. Now we have the true glory years. Competition between streaming and terrestrial has never been more intense, nor competition between film and television for talent. We are, in short, being spoilt damn rotten, we greedy, needy children. A major player, of course, has been the BBC. Let me attempt to mount a full-throated defence. We should be clutching that corporation as close to our hearts as the NHS. And, similarly, it has savage problems. Somehow, despite being among the most ardently woke of any British institution, ever, it managed to embroil itself in a gender pay row. I have no hesitation in blaming top-heavy, vole-in-the-headlights management. I have no hesitation either in celebrating the wonderful giftings to us throughout the year of producers, writers, stars, cameramen, production designers and makeup chaps and the rest, all handed to us for 365 days a year for, essentially, the price of a middling coffee maker on Amazon. And then there\u2019s free radio all year, telling us about everything. The corporation is infuriating, not least when it feels the wheedling need to advertise itself (badly, smugly): but it\u2019s what we\u2019ve got and I\u2019m proud and grateful. Streaming has come of age, settled down somewhat. You tend to grow to know what you\u2019re going to binge on, rather than graze. And it has produced some true marvels. I\u2019ve found myself having to leave out from my top 10 many wonderful fantasies. His Dark Materials, Game of Thrones. Sorry. Sorry. And a few streaming-only offerings that, in 1979, might have rocked our world \u2013 The Politician, Stranger Things 3, Watchmen, Living With Yourself. And many comedies, mainly driven by a singular quirked personality. Fleabag, of course, but also GameFace, Aisling Bea\u2019s This Way Up, Motherland \u2013 and that lovely, short sweet run, State of the Union. Black Mirror as well, although too few episodes. There was sadcom too \u2013 don\u2019t forget Don\u2019t Forget the Driver, Defending the Guilty. And with Stath Lets Flats and Flack, we were laughing all the way until we suddenly stopped. There was also a welcome rise in unknown stars. Just think Kaitlyn Dever in Unbelievable. Although, with Catch-22 and The Looming Tower, George Clooney and Jeff Daniels reminded us why they get big Hollywood bucks. Summer of Rockets \u2013 unquantifiable, still a delight. The latest Marvelous Mrs Maisel and Top Boy \u2013 the list would go on if I let it. Honourable mentions to some fab thrillers too, including Spiral and Money Heist, the best foreign-language geezers around. My beloved Endeavour has dropped from the list, despite one of my favourite lines of the year, Fred Thursday\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re not a man. You\u2019re not the arse of a man\u201d. Another two series commissioned, however. Hurrah. The Capture was prophetic, gripping; Cold Call equally; similarly, BBC Scotland\u2019s Guilt. Documentaries raised the game. Spotlight on the Troubles. Who Are You Calling Fat?, The Family Secret, Kathy Burke\u2019s All Woman. I decided at an early stage not to review reality TV, because it\u2019s nothing of the sort, just celeb flibber. Not, all things considered, a bad year. It was just real life that let us down. The top 10 TV dramas of 2019 1. Chernobyl Sky Atlantic I said in May that this was the best TV I\u2019d seen so far this year and I see no call to revise. We were all blindsided. Some are talking of it as not just the best show of the year but of the decade. 2. The Crown Netflix No time at all for the whingers who think Colman an ill-judged replacement for Claire Foy; and Tobias Menzies as Phil, and Josh O\u2019Connor as Charles, bring savage new talent and a tragic powerplay. 3. The Virtues Channel 4 Stephen Graham flays his soul. A career-defining performance: expect garlands. Nobel prize for acting? 4. Mum BBC Two Closed wisely, winsomely, as it was performed throughout. Real life, a twitch heightened. 5. Unbelievable Netflix Who did you believe? The lass who\u2019d been raped? The big preening cops? Intense, mesmerising. 6. Years and Years BBC One Most splendid six-parter to grace our screens this year. The imagination, the perspicacity, rival Wells, Verne, Orwell. 7. Killing Eve BBC One No time either for those who said it had gone off the boil. Just magnificent, and long may Villanelle reign. 8. Gentleman Jack BBC One The sprightly mood belied several deep and dark and long-held prejudices, gloriously hung out here on a stiffened washing line. 9. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale Channel 4 A searing last series. Still obliquely haunted. 10. Succession Sky Atlantic A never-slowing triumph. Of acting, of nuance, of power, of greed, of sheer drama. Turkey Several contenders \u2013 The Widow, the execrable \u201ccomedy\u201d Warren, the yawn-by-numbers Beecham House, the relentlessly unengaging Sanditon, but one winner. Question Time, in its 40th anniversary year, had little to celebrate. Nothing to do with Fiona Bruce; everything to do with producers packing the audience with partisan rabble-rousers, as if this country didn\u2019t yearn enough for pointless anger. Also, with MPs not giving a rat\u2019s ass.",

For the 19-year-old right-back, the Emirates Stadium was some place to make a professional debut. He rose to the challenge, keeping Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang quiet and making one thrilling foray into Arsenal territory before playing in Tammy Abraham. It says plenty about Chelsea\u2019s short-term youth policy that Lampard felt able to throw an untried teenager into a game of this magnitude. It says plenty about Chelsea\u2019s long-term youth policy that they may not be able to keep him. Lamptey\u2019s contract is up at the end of the season, and Paris Saint-Germain are ready to pounce. \u201cHopefully he feels a bit of love,\u201d Lampard said afterwards.

January could yet bring some respite and next month looks pivotal to their survival chances. They face three of the four teams below them in their next three matches before a reunion with Brighton, who brushed them aside on Saturday. Injuries have taken their toll \u2013 they have nine first-team players sidelined, including Nathan Ak\u00e9 and David Brooks \u2013 but, as the captain Steve Cook openly acknowledged, there is no excuse for failing to execute the basics. \u201cWe looked flat on our feet, dead on our feet from front to back,\u201d the defender said. \u201cWe have got to recover and really reflect on this because it was nowhere near good enough. No fight, no endeavour, no bravery.\u201d <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/28/brighton-bournemouth-premier-league-report\" title=\"\"><em>Brighton 2-0 Bournemouth</em></a></p> <h2>3) Pereira hits top gear when United need him most </h2> <p>With Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay\u2019s absences dominating the pre-match discussion for Manchester United on Saturday, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s makeshift midfield trio did a fine job without them at Burnley. Fred\u2019s resurgence in a United shirt continued apace while Nemanja Matic did what was asked of him in typical Nemanja Matic fashion. But perhaps the biggest positive was Andreas Pereira. Turf Moor was the backdrop for possibly the most impressive performance of his United career to date, where he was arguably the best player on the field until his substitution, typified by his inch-perfect assist for Anthony Martial\u2019s opener. It felt like a coming-of-age display and with McTominay out for a month and questions about Pogba never far away, Pereira showed he has the ability to play a key role for Solskj\u00e6r in 2020. <strong>Aaron Bower</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/28/burnley-manchester-united-premier-league-report\" title=\"\"><em>Burnley 0-2 Manchester United</em></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Nuno\u2019s tinkering spares Liverpool full force of Traor\u00e9 </h2> <p>Pep Guardiola\u2019s complaints about the heaviness of the festive fixture list raised the usual catcalls from those who believe multimillionaire footballers should play every day if the paying public demand it. But his sense the fates and authorities are against Manchester City will not have been dimmed by Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s team selection at Anfield. Adama Traor\u00e9 had dismantled City on Friday night and yet Liverpool did not face Wolves\u2019s right-wing flier until the 58th minute, by which time the runaway leaders were in front. \u201cNo matter who is inside the pitch we are always confident we can compete with the best,\u201d said Nuno in explaining his four starting selection changes. His team was true to his word but Liverpool will have been relieved they did not face Traor\u00e9\u2019s explosiveness for a full 90 minutes when they themselves were coming off a heavy schedule. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/29/liverpool-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\"><em>Liverpool 1-0 Wolves</em></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e91050b897b67bee15a84c3dec9f3dcb7b2a917\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e91050b897b67bee15a84c3dec9f3dcb7b2a917/0_179_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adama Traor\u00e9 gets away from Jordan Henderson during a threatening cameo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adama Traor\u00e9 gets away from Jordan Henderson during a threatening cameo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5) Guardiola must spend to fix City\u2019s ramshackle defence</h2> <p>It only takes a simple pass to rip open the City defence and it has been happening all too often. The team is struggling to cope without Aymeric Laporte but the constant changing of the back four is not helping anyone. Eric Garc\u00eda was the latest to be sent into the quagmire, playing next to Oleksandr Zinchenko, who was starting his first Premier League game since September. If it was not for VAR, City would have gone behind only for Lys Mousset to be deemed marginally offside. There was no offside trap involved, as at the time the City defence was shaped like a diamond and not capable of repelling any form of attack, let alone one at pace. Pep Guardiola needs to think long and hard about what he does in January as without defensive reinforcement the chances of winning the elusive Champions League trophy will diminish. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/29/manchester-city-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\"><em>Manchester City 2-0 Sheffield United</em></a></p> <h2>6) Unlikely double act puts Everton in fight mode </h2> <p>Carlo Ancelotti and Duncan Ferguson may not seem natural soulmates but Jordan Pickford sees dream-team potential in their ostensibly unlikely manager-assistant double act at Everton.

But the Foxes would have won more comfortably had Lukasz Fabianski not saved Demarai Gray\u2019s penalty. Rather than giving the appearance of a weakened team owing to the fixture pile-up, Leicester had the luxury of turning to young talents such as Gray and Kelechi Iheanacho, both clearly determined to state their cases for regular starting spots. Ayoze P\u00e9rez\u2019s assist for Gray\u2019s winner was sublime, too.

      "bodyText": "1) Lamptey\u2019s fine debut may not prevent rapid Chelsea exit Welcome to the Premier League, then, Tariq Lamptey. And \u2013 quite possibly \u2013 farewell. For the 19-year-old right-back, the Emirates Stadium was some place to make a professional debut. He rose to the challenge, keeping Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang quiet and making one thrilling foray into Arsenal territory before playing in Tammy Abraham. It says plenty about Chelsea\u2019s short-term youth policy that Lampard felt able to throw an untried teenager into a game of this magnitude. It says plenty about Chelsea\u2019s long-term youth policy that they may not be able to keep him. Lamptey\u2019s contract is up at the end of the season, and Paris Saint-Germain are ready to pounce. \u201cHopefully he feels a bit of love,\u201d Lampard said afterwards. The question, with three right-backs ahead of him and time running out, is whether it will be enough. Jonathan Liew \u2022 Match report: Arsenal 1-2 Chelsea 2) Cook serves up cold hard truths for Bournemouth Eddie Howe knows Bournemouth\u2019s backs are against the wall after seven defeats in their past nine matches and there is no room to hide as they attempt to stop the rot. January could yet bring some respite and next month looks pivotal to their survival chances. They face three of the four teams below them in their next three matches before a reunion with Brighton, who brushed them aside on Saturday. Injuries have taken their toll \u2013 they have nine first-team players sidelined, including Nathan Ak\u00e9 and David Brooks \u2013 but, as the captain Steve Cook openly acknowledged, there is no excuse for failing to execute the basics. \u201cWe looked flat on our feet, dead on our feet from front to back,\u201d the defender said. \u201cWe have got to recover and really reflect on this because it was nowhere near good enough. No fight, no endeavour, no bravery.\u201d Ben Fisher \u2022 Match report: Brighton 2-0 Bournemouth 3) Pereira hits top gear when United need him most With Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay\u2019s absences dominating the pre-match discussion for Manchester United on Saturday, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s makeshift midfield trio did a fine job without them at Burnley. Fred\u2019s resurgence in a United shirt continued apace while Nemanja Matic did what was asked of him in typical Nemanja Matic fashion. But perhaps the biggest positive was Andreas Pereira. Turf Moor was the backdrop for possibly the most impressive performance of his United career to date, where he was arguably the best player on the field until his substitution, typified by his inch-perfect assist for Anthony Martial\u2019s opener. It felt like a coming-of-age display and with McTominay out for a month and questions about Pogba never far away, Pereira showed he has the ability to play a key role for Solskj\u00e6r in 2020. Aaron Bower \u2022 Match report: Burnley 0-2 Manchester United 4) Nuno\u2019s tinkering spares Liverpool full force of Traor\u00e9 Pep Guardiola\u2019s complaints about the heaviness of the festive fixture list raised the usual catcalls from those who believe multimillionaire footballers should play every day if the paying public demand it. But his sense the fates and authorities are against Manchester City will not have been dimmed by Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s team selection at Anfield. Adama Traor\u00e9 had dismantled City on Friday night and yet Liverpool did not face Wolves\u2019s right-wing flier until the 58th minute, by which time the runaway leaders were in front. \u201cNo matter who is inside the pitch we are always confident we can compete with the best,\u201d said Nuno in explaining his four starting selection changes. His team was true to his word but Liverpool will have been relieved they did not face Traor\u00e9\u2019s explosiveness for a full 90 minutes when they themselves were coming off a heavy schedule. John Brewin \u2022 Match report: Liverpool 1-0 Wolves 5) Guardiola must spend to fix City\u2019s ramshackle defence It only takes a simple pass to rip open the City defence and it has been happening all too often. The team is struggling to cope without Aymeric Laporte but the constant changing of the back four is not helping anyone. Eric Garc\u00eda was the latest to be sent into the quagmire, playing next to Oleksandr Zinchenko, who was starting his first Premier League game since September. If it was not for VAR, City would have gone behind only for Lys Mousset to be deemed marginally offside. There was no offside trap involved, as at the time the City defence was shaped like a diamond and not capable of repelling any form of attack, let alone one at pace. Pep Guardiola needs to think long and hard about what he does in January as without defensive reinforcement the chances of winning the elusive Champions League trophy will diminish. Will Unwin \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 2-0 Sheffield United 6) Unlikely double act puts Everton in fight mode Carlo Ancelotti and Duncan Ferguson may not seem natural soulmates but Jordan Pickford sees dream-team potential in their ostensibly unlikely manager-assistant double act at Everton. Forget the moment when Ferguson, back to No 2 after his caretaker stint, almost knocked Ancelotti over as he celebrated Dominic Calvert-Lewin\u2019s first goal and a subsequent cameo when the Italian appeared to be advising him to calm down, England\u2019s goalkeeper envisages a sharp climbing of the table. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have Carlo in charge,\u201d said Pickford. \u201cHe\u2019s tried to implement one or two things and we\u2019ll need time to adapt but we\u2019re showing great character. We were underachieving but Duncan brought a bit of fight to the team which is crucial. That\u2019s the Everton way. The new boss has made it clear he wants us to play football but also show fight. Suddenly fifth or sixth position is within reach.\u201d Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Newcastle 1-2 Everton 7) Could Ndombele be long-term replacement for Demb\u00e9l\u00e9? Jos\u00e9 Mourinho slightly overstated matters when he said his Spurs side had \u201ccreated from minute one to minute 90\u201d in their draw with Norwich.

His first film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/19/in-the-loop-review\" title=\"\"><em>In the Loop</em></a>, grew out of his seminal satirical TV comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/25/thick-of-it-bbc-political-satire-ends\" title=\"\"><em>The Thick of It</em></a>. The second, the highly acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/09/the-death-of-stalin-review-armando-iannucci-toronto-film-festival-tiff\" title=\"\"><em>The Death of Stalin</em></a>, was a darkly comic but historically accurate account of the Soviet dictator\u2019s end and its farcical aftermath.</p> <p>Both films could be described as hard-edged political comedy, the genre for which Iannucci is best known. In that context <em>David Copperfield</em> is a surprising departure. Let\u2019s face it, a Victorian costume drama is a long way from Malcolm Tucker, <em>The Thick of It\u2019s</em> political enforcer, whose baroque use of expletives weaponised the management of government ministers.</p> <p>Did a Dickens adaptation feel like a step into the unknown?</p> <p>\u201cPersonally I didn\u2019t think it was any different,\u201d he says evenly, \u201cthough I can see why people might think that.\u201d</p> <p>He cites the different TV shows he\u2019s written or directed, such as <em>I\u2019m Alan Partridge</em>, as examples of his non-political and non-profane work. \u201cI personally am not a sweary, angry man,\u201d he adds, perhaps unnecessarily.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHG7FnBDY0Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oHG7FnBDY0Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHG7FnBDY0Q\">Watch a trailer for The Personal History of David Copperfield.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In fact, Iannucci, who abandoned a PhD on Milton\u2019s <em>Paradise Lost</em> to go into comedy, is a longtime admirer of Dickens. He began reading him when he was 13 and was instantly struck by the \u201ccombination of humanity and satire and funniness\u201d. A few years ago he wrote and presented a TV documentary called <em>Armando\u2019s Tale of Charles Dickens</em>, an affectionate and critically astute appreciation of the novelist.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s the finest comedian we\u2019ve ever produced,\u201d he said in that film. \u201cMuch comedy today is still conditioned by the way Dickens wrote it in the 19th century.\u201d</p> <p>Iannucci certainly looks for the comedy in <em>David Copperfield</em>, though it\u2019s of a much gentler and broader nature than his fans are used to. The film is handsomely shot and something of a narrative whirlwind, as the young David survives numerous setbacks and twists of fate to come of age as an ambitious young writer. Copperfield is played with great warmth by Dev Patel, the lead in a multi-ethnic cast. If nothing else, the effect of the colour-blind casting is to break the starchy conventions of costume-drama\u2019s deference to \u201chistorical accuracy\u201d and create what might be called a more 21st-century vision of Victorian Britain.</p> <p>\u201cIt just felt like, why are we not doing this?\u201d says Iannucci of the decision to ignore the actors\u2019 skin colours. \u201cIt\u2019s when I thought of Dev as David. He said: \u2018Do I have an Indian father?\u2019 No. Although it\u2019s set in 1840. For the people in the film it\u2019s the present day. And it\u2019s an exciting present. It wasn\u2019t a conscious reaction to Brexit, but the conversation has gone very insular in terms of what Britain is and what it doesn\u2019t want to be. I wanted to celebrate what Britain actually is, and it\u2019s much more of a carefree, enjoyable, humorous kind of zesty, energetic place.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94540a9d8cea51a37d757bb3abbab325d7096806\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94540a9d8cea51a37d757bb3abbab325d7096806/0_226_3584_2151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Capaldi and Chris Addison in Iannucci\u2019s 2009 film debut, In The Loop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Capaldi and Chris Addison in Iannucci\u2019s 2009 film debut, In the Loop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the centre of the Iannucci documentary on Dickens was <em>David Copperfield</em>. He thinks it\u2019s the book that marks the midpoint of Dickens\u2019s career and the transition from being an episodic novelist to one who writes a more ambitious and encompassing kind of fiction.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still a bit of a baggy monster,\u201d says Iannucci, \u201cbut the things he\u2019s experimenting with in <em>David Copperfield</em> become <em>Great Expectations</em> and <em>Bleak House</em> and <em>Little Dorrit</em>.\u201d</p> <p>In many respects, says Iannucci, <em>David Copperfield</em> is a surprisingly modern work. He reread the book a decade ago, having not looked at it since his teens, and he was amazed by how experimental it was. \u201cIt starts off in sentences of one word as [the baby] David tries to make sense of colour and shape. It\u2019s very cinematic.\u201d</p> <p>In the documentary, he describes Dickens using Copperfield as a \u201ccamera\u201d through which to view the world. So for many years he could see the visual potential of the novel, though it wasn\u2019t until he was making <em>The Death of Stalin</em> that he could see a way of doing it.</p> <p>\u201cWith <em>Stalin</em> it was the first time I had done a period piece. I worked with great costume and makeup and location and a DOP [director of photography] and Chris Willis who did the music. I just thought, this team, we\u2019re ready to do <em>David Copperfield</em> now.\u201d</p> <p>While Victorian England is obviously a material world away from its 21st-century counterpart, there are themes in the novel that continue to resonate in today\u2019s society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4581b897362c9902e120ab36d9010cb0a32b7661\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4581b897362c9902e120ab36d9010cb0a32b7661/0_89_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Isaacs as Field Marshal Zhukov in 2017\u2019s The Death of Stalin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Isaacs as Field Marshal Zhukov in 2017\u2019s The Death of Stalin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicola Dove/EOne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe whole book is about status anxiety,\u201d Iannucci says, \u201cwhich Dickens had as well. It\u2019s that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/22/zelig-film-review\" title=\"\">Zelig</a> quality of wanting to be in the gang, trying to be absorbed within it. That feels very real and contemporary to me, the continual anxiety about background, where I come from, my beginnings. Dev and I were talking about this, and maybe it\u2019s coming from families that one or two generations back were outside the UK. It\u2019s that idea of, are we fully integrated? Are we settled? Do we see ourselves as inside or outside, neither one nor the other?\u201d</p> <p>If you were looking for an obvious outsider, Iannucci wouldn\u2019t be your first port of call. The product of a Glasgow private school, Oxford, and the BBC, he was also the focal point of a generation of comic talent, including Steve Coogan, Chris Morris, Stewart Lee, Rebecca Front and Richard Herring. They appeared on his early 1990s radio news parody <em>On the Hour</em>, and its later TV version, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/17/the-day-today-chris-morris-alan-partridge-changed-satire-forever\" title=\"\"><em>The Day Today</em></a>. He seemed to be at the centre of everything \u2013 the very opposite of a man from the margins.</p> <p>But these things are relative. The more inside an outsider gets, the more outside he can feel. Copperfield is both an outside-insider and an inside-outsider. Like many of Dickens\u2019s characters and Dickens himself, he is born into a comfortable life which becomes suddenly more precarious, subject to precipitous social descent and grinding recovery. On the way down \u2013 or rather back up \u2013 he passes the ever-so-falsely-humble figure of Uriah Heep \u2013 played in the film by Ben Whishaw \u2013 who envies Copperfield\u2019s apparent social ease.</p> <p>Heep is an unappealing character, cloying and scheming, but he is also a victim of snobbery, of a kind that still persists today. There are few positions in the enduring British class system more mocked than that occupied by the upwardly mobile working class or lower middle class. The accents, manners and pretensions of those who wish to \u201cbetter themselves\u201d have always been fertile ground for British comedy.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Iannucci agrees, who says he feels sorry for Heep. \u201cIt\u2019s <em>Dad\u2019s Army</em>. Captain Mainwaring still feels a little cowed by Wilson.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"60493bd211e296ea317896fb29646fb65140db42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60493bd211e296ea317896fb29646fb65140db42/0_166_3280_4100/800.jpg\" alt=\"With Hugh Laurie and Dev Patel for the premiere of The Personal History of David Copperfield at the London Film Festival.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Hugh Laurie and Dev Patel for the premiere of The Personal History of David Copperfield at the London film festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Young/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To Mainwaring you can add Alan Partridge and David Brent \u2013 and even, at a stretch, Basil Fawlty. All of them are in a sense heirs to Heep, alive to every social slight but blind to their own desperation to look down on others. The other tragicomic archetype in the novel is Wilkins Micawber, the perennially in-debt older friend of Copperfield, swinging between outlandish optimism and epic self-pity. The character was partially based on Dickens\u2019s own father, who spent time in a debtor\u2019s prison.</p> <p>In the film he\u2019s played by Iannucci\u2019s fellow Glaswegian Peter Capaldi, who, as Malcolm Tucker in <em>The Thick of It</em>, managed to make Alastair Campbell look like a model of equanimity and verbal restraint. As with most of the characters in the film, Capaldi struggles to compress Dickens\u2019s vivid descriptions and breadth of characterisation into a few scenes. Everyone \u2013 including Tilda Swinton as Betsey Trotwood and Hugh Laurie as Mr Dick \u2013 puts in a good turn, but while Dickens\u2019s inventiveness is well captured, something of the novel\u2019s emotional richness is inevitably lost.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s a bold and imaginative take on one of the English literary canon\u2019s most loved writers, someone whose work has often suffered in adaptation from an excess of visual cliches. Iannucci\u2019s main criterion for making a film, he once said, is that he can\u2019t imagine anyone else making it. That\u2019s a reasonable assessment of his <em>David Copperfield</em>.</p> <p>Equally, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone else having made <em>The Death of Stalin</em>, one of the most original and powerfully realised British productions of recent times. It was no surprise that Iannucci could make us laugh, but the manner in which he grasped the psychology of terror, combining the hysterical with the sinister, was a revelation.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea was to try and recreate the low-level anxiety that people had to go through every day,\u201d he says. \u201cSo not the heightened anxiety of \u2018They\u2019re going to shoot me tomorrow\u2019 but more like \u2018I don\u2019t know if they will shoot me tomorrow or the next day or the day after\u2019. And some are able to kind of just cope with that.\u201d</p> <p>He speaks about the strange current-day echoes of that dark period, with two of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s closest advisers having not so long ago mounted defences of Stalin\u2019s leadership and achievements. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing,\u201d says Iannucci, \u201cbecause it feels unreal. I thought we\u2019d gone through that and come out the other side.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"292efc4d16f8706d83c417ebbcfc5835f2c42c52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/292efc4d16f8706d83c417ebbcfc5835f2c42c52/502_0_3079_1848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UK.

But if there is no longer a code of behaviour, I don\u2019t quite see how you can do the disrupting, because they\u2019re doing the disrupting by saying there\u2019s no code of behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>The old saw says that we get the politicians we deserve, and there is an argument that better, more honest and more morally sound candidates have been deterred by the general contempt in which politicians have been popularly held for some time now. Alastair Campbell once accused Iannucci of believing that \u201call politics was basically crass, all politicians venal, all advisers base\u201d, and Campbell and others have suggested that this prevailing cynicism has led us to this point. If so, would Iannucci see himself as part of that process?</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cI would argue that he [Campbell] was part of it. In things like <em>The Thick of It</em> we never showed anyone breaking the law, we just showed people bending the rules to try to get themselves out of a hole, while the media and public forced them to go through more and more contortions. In fact, people have said to me the more sympathetic characters in those shows are the elected politicians. So I always said to any politician who said you\u2019re disillusioning people in politics, OK, well prove me wrong then. Prove to me that public political behaviour can be inspirational.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"19bc06a0b371cd9e4018d05a5dca1d7333ff0880\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19bc06a0b371cd9e4018d05a5dca1d7333ff0880/0_151_4050_2430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Louis-Dreyfus in Iannucci\u2019s satire of US politics, Veep.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Louis-Dreyfus in Iannucci\u2019s satire of US politics, Veep.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Harbron/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The Thick of It</em>, its Iannucci-created American counterpart <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/07/veep-last-season-seven-hbo\" title=\"\"><em>Veep</em></a>, and his debut film <em>In </em><em>the Loop</em> all revolved around the dysfunctional relationship between politicians and the media. Now, it could be said, politicians have taken their revenge by bypassing the media. Donald Trump has disseminated his message \u2013 including his many lies \u2013 directly through social media.</p> <p>\u201cI think what Trump has been really good at,\u201d he says, \u201cis he reads the minds of people outside the media circle or their political circle. Politicians think we pick up the newspaper and read all the political articles. We don\u2019t. We pick it up and read the sport, we leaf through it and if we see something that grabs our attention\u2026\u201d He mimes stopping on a page. \u201cSorry, that\u2019s what we do.\u201d</p> <p>Everything Iannucci says is delivered in a tone of either mild irony or incredulity, as if he\u2019s been around long enough not to be surprised by anything but is nonetheless still occasionally nonplussed. As a young man he briefly considered becoming a priest, and there\u2019s still something a little solemn about the way Iannucci presents himself. Not joyless, but serious. Actors who have worked with him testify to his grave dedication. But the comic actor and writer David Mitchell says that there is a more outgoing aspect to Iannucci that we see less of nowadays.</p> <p>\u201cBefore his film directing career was quite as stellar as it now is,\u201d says Mitchell, \u201che used to occasionally come on the odd panel show. I think he\u2019s brilliant, very funny, and you know the whole side of him as a performer has been forgotten. His is exactly the sort of hilarious yet civilising brain that does the world good. Whatever he says on Twitter, I always think: \u2018This is wisdom.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I like having brought in young writers and directors and being able to see them go off and do their own thing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The truth is Iannucci has reached that level where comedy is a serious business. It\u2019s not just that he\u2019s moved from what he calls the \u201cgag-heavy sketch comedy\u201d of his early years to a more narrative-based humour. It\u2019s also that his position of responsibility has grown ever more weighty. As a film director and also TV showrunner on HBO\u2019s <em>Veep</em> and <em>Avenue 5</em>, a forthcoming HBO science-fiction comedy starring Hugh Laurie, he\u2019s in a position in which a lot of people look to him for direction. What kind of boss is he?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a sort of benevolent dictator,\u201d he says. \u201cIf somebody has an idea, great. If that idea turns out to be funnier than the script that we spent a week writing this scene for, then we\u2019ll chuck that script out and go with that because that seems to work better. I\u2019m all for that.\u201d</p> <p>Which role does he prefer \u2013 film director or TV showrunner?</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re completely different parts of the brain that you use. For the film, you have to hold everything in your head at once and see the shape of it at all times. With TV shows, you can\u2019t go too big in any one episode because you\u2019ve got to reset the chess board for the following week.\u201d</p> <p>In both cases, he says, people are continually looking to him for answers. Ninety per cent of the time, he says, it doesn\u2019t really matter what the answer is. \u201cThe hard bit is working out what are the questions where the answer is so important you can actually say: \u2018I don\u2019t know, let me think about that.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8Zr3f-_Ft8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w8Zr3f-_Ft8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8Zr3f-_Ft8\">Watch a trailer for Iannucci\u2019s new HBO comedy series, Avenue 5.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>He likes working with HBO, he says, because it\u2019s like the BBC used to be. He\u2019s not sure how the BBC operates now, but \u201cthere was a phase where you\u2019d make something but you wouldn\u2019t hear back for three months and then there\u2019d be lots of notes. Lots of, yeah, we like that but here\u2019s the title and here\u2019s the star who\u2019s going to be in it.\u201d</p> <p>Now that he\u2019s established a foothold in the US, other British talent has been able to follow. The most obvious example is <em>Succession </em>showrunner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/29/succession-comedy-drama-tv-media-barons-jesse-armstrong\" title=\"\">Jesse Armstrong</a>, one of the writers on <em>The Thick of It</em>. Iannucci is a big fan of <em>Succession</em>. Does he feel a sense of pride when people who have worked for him go on to great success?</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, \u201cthey get there with their own talent and ability but I\u2019m just pleased to have been around as they were starting off. I like having brought in young writers and directors and been able to see them go off and do their own thing.\u201d</p> <p>He has just turned 56, close to the age at which Dickens died, quite possibly from overwork. The novelist produced a massive amount of fiction, nonfiction, journalism, and was also a public performer and political activist. \u201cYou could say he was a workaholic,\u201d says Iannucci.</p> <p>Aside from <em>David Copperfield</em> and <em>Avenue 5</em>, he has two scripts in the pipeline. Does he think of himself as a workaholic?</p> <p>\u201cI used to be, in my 20s and 30s, but actually once you get married and have a family, you want to be a good parent. So I try to restrict work to working intensely but Monday to Friday. You can\u2019t always do that.\u201d</p> <p>He is married to Rachel Jones, whom he met at university when she did the lighting on his one-man show. They have three children and live in Hertfordshire. For all his success in America, you get the strong sense of someone firmly rooted in this country, even if it\u2019s going through what he calls an \u201cidentity crisis\u201d with Brexit. But he says: \u201cThank God I was born in the UK, because I wanted to go into comedy. This is the right place for it. There\u2019s an amazing literary tradition here. We make the best films and television in the world. We\u2019re innovators. We\u2019re funny. It\u2019s a country with the mostly highly developed sense of humour, anywhere. But why can\u2019t we celebrate all that and just be happy that we can do that?\u201d</p> <p>In his own ironic way, Iannucci is that celebration, and one that is well worth celebrating.</p> <p><em>The Personal History of David Copperfield opens in the UK on 24 January. Avenue 5 starts on 22 January, 10pm, Sky One</em></p> <h2>Four of Iannucci\u2019s finest, chosen by Guy Lodge</h2> <p><strong><em>The Thick of It</em> (2005-2012)</strong><br>Running irregularly from 2005 to 2012, Iannucci\u2019s inventively foul-mouthed sitcom set a new bar for British political comedy, exploring the world of spin and red tape in the fictional Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship with both aching accuracy and a riotous sense of farce. Its 2009 big-screen spinoff,<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/19/in-the-loop-review\" title=\"\"><em>In the Loop</em></a>, was just as darkly hilarious and landed Iannucci an Oscar nomination.</p> <p><strong><em>Veep</em> (2012-2019)</strong><br>When Iannucci crossed the pond to bring his brand of inner-government satire to Washington, many assumed he\u2019d be somewhat defanged by American producers, but his pin-sharp White House takedown proved doubters wrong. Led by the impeccable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/julia-louis-dreyfus\" title=\"\">Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a> as a chaos-inclined vice-president (and eventual commander-in-chief), the Emmy-laden HBO sitcom took America into the Trump era, amping up the savagery all the way.</p> <p><strong><em>The Death of Stalin</em> (2017)</strong><br>Iannucci\u2019s second film as director emphatically proved his political nous has no geographical or historical restrictions. Dramatising the anarchic Kremlin fallout following the Soviet leader\u2019s demise in 1953, it daringly cast a transatlantic ensemble using a tangle of British and American accents, making for a mordant exercise in gallows humour with oddly universal resonance \u2013 and an unexpectedly poignant streak.</p> <p><strong><em>The Personal History of David Copperfield</em> (2019)</strong><br>Charles Dickens\u2019s authorial voice is so pungently distinctive that you might expect it to clash with Iannucci\u2019s zingy contemporary style, but they make surprisingly jolly bedfellows. His rollicking, beautifully designed take on the oft-adapted novel keeps the tragicomic romp lavishly in period, but freshens things up with colour-blind casting and a pointed nod to contemporary class wars.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Armando Iannucci is not someone you\u2019d describe as having a commanding presence. He doesn\u2019t want to consume all the oxygen in the room or, with a show of bored impatience, imply that it\u2019s your good fortune to share his company. He may be well known, but there\u2019s nothing of the celebrity about him. Short, balding and understated in manner, he could pass for a provincial loss adjuster come to assess your insurance claim. But he is arguably the most influential figure in British comedy of the past three decades, not to mention an accomplished film director. When I meet him at a London hotel, he is busy promoting his third feature film, The Personal History of David Copperfield, an adaptation of Charles Dickens\u2019s eighth and most autobiographical novel. His first film, In the Loop, grew out of his seminal satirical TV comedy The Thick of It. The second, the highly acclaimed The Death of Stalin, was a darkly comic but historically accurate account of the Soviet dictator\u2019s end and its farcical aftermath. Both films could be described as hard-edged political comedy, the genre for which Iannucci is best known. In that context David Copperfield is a surprising departure. Let\u2019s face it, a Victorian costume drama is a long way from Malcolm Tucker, The Thick of It\u2019s political enforcer, whose baroque use of expletives weaponised the management of government ministers. Did a Dickens adaptation feel like a step into the unknown? \u201cPersonally I didn\u2019t think it was any different,\u201d he says evenly, \u201cthough I can see why people might think that.\u201d He cites the different TV shows he\u2019s written or directed, such as I\u2019m Alan Partridge, as examples of his non-political and non-profane work. \u201cI personally am not a sweary, angry man,\u201d he adds, perhaps unnecessarily. In fact, Iannucci, who abandoned a PhD on Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost to go into comedy, is a longtime admirer of Dickens. He began reading him when he was 13 and was instantly struck by the \u201ccombination of humanity and satire and funniness\u201d. A few years ago he wrote and presented a TV documentary called Armando\u2019s Tale of Charles Dickens, an affectionate and critically astute appreciation of the novelist. \u201cI think he\u2019s the finest comedian we\u2019ve ever produced,\u201d he said in that film. \u201cMuch comedy today is still conditioned by the way Dickens wrote it in the 19th century.\u201d Iannucci certainly looks for the comedy in David Copperfield, though it\u2019s of a much gentler and broader nature than his fans are used to. The film is handsomely shot and something of a narrative whirlwind, as the young David survives numerous setbacks and twists of fate to come of age as an ambitious young writer. Copperfield is played with great warmth by Dev Patel, the lead in a multi-ethnic cast. If nothing else, the effect of the colour-blind casting is to break the starchy conventions of costume-drama\u2019s deference to \u201chistorical accuracy\u201d and create what might be called a more 21st-century vision of Victorian Britain. \u201cIt just felt like, why are we not doing this?\u201d says Iannucci of the decision to ignore the actors\u2019 skin colours. \u201cIt\u2019s when I thought of Dev as David. He said: \u2018Do I have an Indian father?\u2019 No. Although it\u2019s set in 1840. For the people in the film it\u2019s the present day. And it\u2019s an exciting present. It wasn\u2019t a conscious reaction to Brexit, but the conversation has gone very insular in terms of what Britain is and what it doesn\u2019t want to be. I wanted to celebrate what Britain actually is, and it\u2019s much more of a carefree, enjoyable, humorous kind of zesty, energetic place.\u201d At the centre of the Iannucci documentary on Dickens was David Copperfield. He thinks it\u2019s the book that marks the midpoint of Dickens\u2019s career and the transition from being an episodic novelist to one who writes a more ambitious and encompassing kind of fiction. \u201cIt\u2019s still a bit of a baggy monster,\u201d says Iannucci, \u201cbut the things he\u2019s experimenting with in David Copperfield become Great Expectations and Bleak House and Little Dorrit.\u201d In many respects, says Iannucci, David Copperfield is a surprisingly modern work. He reread the book a decade ago, having not looked at it since his teens, and he was amazed by how experimental it was. \u201cIt starts off in sentences of one word as [the baby] David tries to make sense of colour and shape. It\u2019s very cinematic.\u201d In the documentary, he describes Dickens using Copperfield as a \u201ccamera\u201d through which to view the world. So for many years he could see the visual potential of the novel, though it wasn\u2019t until he was making The Death of Stalin that he could see a way of doing it. \u201cWith Stalin it was the first time I had done a period piece. I worked with great costume and makeup and location and a DOP [director of photography] and Chris Willis who did the music. I just thought, this team, we\u2019re ready to do David Copperfield now.\u201d While Victorian England is obviously a material world away from its 21st-century counterpart, there are themes in the novel that continue to resonate in today\u2019s society. \u201cThe whole book is about status anxiety,\u201d Iannucci says, \u201cwhich Dickens had as well. It\u2019s that Zelig quality of wanting to be in the gang, trying to be absorbed within it. That feels very real and contemporary to me, the continual anxiety about background, where I come from, my beginnings. Dev and I were talking about this, and maybe it\u2019s coming from families that one or two generations back were outside the UK. It\u2019s that idea of, are we fully integrated? Are we settled? Do we see ourselves as inside or outside, neither one nor the other?\u201d If you were looking for an obvious outsider, Iannucci wouldn\u2019t be your first port of call. The product of a Glasgow private school, Oxford, and the BBC, he was also the focal point of a generation of comic talent, including Steve Coogan, Chris Morris, Stewart Lee, Rebecca Front and Richard Herring. They appeared on his early 1990s radio news parody On the Hour, and its later TV version, The Day Today. He seemed to be at the centre of everything \u2013 the very opposite of a man from the margins. But these things are relative. The more inside an outsider gets, the more outside he can feel. Copperfield is both an outside-insider and an inside-outsider. Like many of Dickens\u2019s characters and Dickens himself, he is born into a comfortable life which becomes suddenly more precarious, subject to precipitous social descent and grinding recovery. On the way down \u2013 or rather back up \u2013 he passes the ever-so-falsely-humble figure of Uriah Heep \u2013 played in the film by Ben Whishaw \u2013 who envies Copperfield\u2019s apparent social ease. Heep is an unappealing character, cloying and scheming, but he is also a victim of snobbery, of a kind that still persists today. There are few positions in the enduring British class system more mocked than that occupied by the upwardly mobile working class or lower middle class. The accents, manners and pretensions of those who wish to \u201cbetter themselves\u201d have always been fertile ground for British comedy. \u201cYes,\u201d Iannucci agrees, who says he feels sorry for Heep. \u201cIt\u2019s Dad\u2019s Army. Captain Mainwaring still feels a little cowed by Wilson.\u201d To Mainwaring you can add Alan Partridge and David Brent \u2013 and even, at a stretch, Basil Fawlty. All of them are in a sense heirs to Heep, alive to every social slight but blind to their own desperation to look down on others. The other tragicomic archetype in the novel is Wilkins Micawber, the perennially in-debt older friend of Copperfield, swinging between outlandish optimism and epic self-pity. The character was partially based on Dickens\u2019s own father, who spent time in a debtor\u2019s prison. In the film he\u2019s played by Iannucci\u2019s fellow Glaswegian Peter Capaldi, who, as Malcolm Tucker in The Thick of It, managed to make Alastair Campbell look like a model of equanimity and verbal restraint. As with most of the characters in the film, Capaldi struggles to compress Dickens\u2019s vivid descriptions and breadth of characterisation into a few scenes. Everyone \u2013 including Tilda Swinton as Betsey Trotwood and Hugh Laurie as Mr Dick \u2013 puts in a good turn, but while Dickens\u2019s inventiveness is well captured, something of the novel\u2019s emotional richness is inevitably lost. Still, it\u2019s a bold and imaginative take on one of the English literary canon\u2019s most loved writers, someone whose work has often suffered in adaptation from an excess of visual cliches. Iannucci\u2019s main criterion for making a film, he once said, is that he can\u2019t imagine anyone else making it. That\u2019s a reasonable assessment of his David Copperfield. Equally, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone else having made The Death of Stalin, one of the most original and powerfully realised British productions of recent times. It was no surprise that Iannucci could make us laugh, but the manner in which he grasped the psychology of terror, combining the hysterical with the sinister, was a revelation. \u201cThe idea was to try and recreate the low-level anxiety that people had to go through every day,\u201d he says. \u201cSo not the heightened anxiety of \u2018They\u2019re going to shoot me tomorrow\u2019 but more like \u2018I don\u2019t know if they will shoot me tomorrow or the next day or the day after\u2019. And some are able to kind of just cope with that.\u201d He speaks about the strange current-day echoes of that dark period, with two of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s closest advisers having not so long ago mounted defences of Stalin\u2019s leadership and achievements. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing,\u201d says Iannucci, \u201cbecause it feels unreal. I thought we\u2019d gone through that and come out the other side.\u201d Then just as bizarre, albeit in a different way, is the sight of Boris Johnson buffooning his way through political debates. \u201cI still don\u2019t believe that he is prime minister,\u201d he says. Has this increasingly surreal picture of British politics made it more difficult to satirise? \u201cWell I think satire requires some kind of universally recognised code of behaviour that you\u2019re then disrupting. But if there is no longer a code of behaviour, I don\u2019t quite see how you can do the disrupting, because they\u2019re doing the disrupting by saying there\u2019s no code of behaviour.\u201d The old saw says that we get the politicians we deserve, and there is an argument that better, more honest and more morally sound candidates have been deterred by the general contempt in which politicians have been popularly held for some time now. Alastair Campbell once accused Iannucci of believing that \u201call politics was basically crass, all politicians venal, all advisers base\u201d, and Campbell and others have suggested that this prevailing cynicism has led us to this point. If so, would Iannucci see himself as part of that process? \u201cNo,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cI would argue that he [Campbell] was part of it. In things like The Thick of It we never showed anyone breaking the law, we just showed people bending the rules to try to get themselves out of a hole, while the media and public forced them to go through more and more contortions. In fact, people have said to me the more sympathetic characters in those shows are the elected politicians. So I always said to any politician who said you\u2019re disillusioning people in politics, OK, well prove me wrong then. Prove to me that public political behaviour can be inspirational.\u201d The Thick of It, its Iannucci-created American counterpart Veep, and his debut film In the Loop all revolved around the dysfunctional relationship between politicians and the media. Now, it could be said, politicians have taken their revenge by bypassing the media. Donald Trump has disseminated his message \u2013 including his many lies \u2013 directly through social media. \u201cI think what Trump has been really good at,\u201d he says, \u201cis he reads the minds of people outside the media circle or their political circle. Politicians think we pick up the newspaper and read all the political articles. We don\u2019t. We pick it up and read the sport, we leaf through it and if we see something that grabs our attention\u2026\u201d He mimes stopping on a page. \u201cSorry, that\u2019s what we do.\u201d Everything Iannucci says is delivered in a tone of either mild irony or incredulity, as if he\u2019s been around long enough not to be surprised by anything but is nonetheless still occasionally nonplussed. As a young man he briefly considered becoming a priest, and there\u2019s still something a little solemn about the way Iannucci presents himself. Not joyless, but serious. Actors who have worked with him testify to his grave dedication. But the comic actor and writer David Mitchell says that there is a more outgoing aspect to Iannucci that we see less of nowadays. \u201cBefore his film directing career was quite as stellar as it now is,\u201d says Mitchell, \u201che used to occasionally come on the odd panel show. I think he\u2019s brilliant, very funny, and you know the whole side of him as a performer has been forgotten. His is exactly the sort of hilarious yet civilising brain that does the world good. Whatever he says on Twitter, I always think: \u2018This is wisdom.\u2019\u201d The truth is Iannucci has reached that level where comedy is a serious business. It\u2019s not just that he\u2019s moved from what he calls the \u201cgag-heavy sketch comedy\u201d of his early years to a more narrative-based humour. It\u2019s also that his position of responsibility has grown ever more weighty. As a film director and also TV showrunner on HBO\u2019s Veep and Avenue 5, a forthcoming HBO science-fiction comedy starring Hugh Laurie, he\u2019s in a position in which a lot of people look to him for direction. What kind of boss is he? \u201cI\u2019m a sort of benevolent dictator,\u201d he says. \u201cIf somebody has an idea, great. If that idea turns out to be funnier than the script that we spent a week writing this scene for, then we\u2019ll chuck that script out and go with that because that seems to work better. I\u2019m all for that.\u201d Which role does he prefer \u2013 film director or TV showrunner? \u201cThey\u2019re completely different parts of the brain that you use. For the film, you have to hold everything in your head at once and see the shape of it at all times. With TV shows, you can\u2019t go too big in any one episode because you\u2019ve got to reset the chess board for the following week.\u201d In both cases, he says, people are continually looking to him for answers. Ninety per cent of the time, he says, it doesn\u2019t really matter what the answer is. \u201cThe hard bit is working out what are the questions where the answer is so important you can actually say: \u2018I don\u2019t know, let me think about that.\u2019\u201d He likes working with HBO, he says, because it\u2019s like the BBC used to be. He\u2019s not sure how the BBC operates now, but \u201cthere was a phase where you\u2019d make something but you wouldn\u2019t hear back for three months and then there\u2019d be lots of notes. Lots of, yeah, we like that but here\u2019s the title and here\u2019s the star who\u2019s going to be in it.\u201d Now that he\u2019s established a foothold in the US, other British talent has been able to follow. The most obvious example is Succession showrunner Jesse Armstrong, one of the writers on The Thick of It. Iannucci is a big fan of Succession. Does he feel a sense of pride when people who have worked for him go on to great success? \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, \u201cthey get there with their own talent and ability but I\u2019m just pleased to have been around as they were starting off. I like having brought in young writers and directors and been able to see them go off and do their own thing.\u201d He has just turned 56, close to the age at which Dickens died, quite possibly from overwork. The novelist produced a massive amount of fiction, nonfiction, journalism, and was also a public performer and political activist. \u201cYou could say he was a workaholic,\u201d says Iannucci. Aside from David Copperfield and Avenue 5, he has two scripts in the pipeline. Does he think of himself as a workaholic? \u201cI used to be, in my 20s and 30s, but actually once you get married and have a family, you want to be a good parent. So I try to restrict work to working intensely but Monday to Friday. You can\u2019t always do that.\u201d He is married to Rachel Jones, whom he met at university when she did the lighting on his one-man show. They have three children and live in Hertfordshire. For all his success in America, you get the strong sense of someone firmly rooted in this country, even if it\u2019s going through what he calls an \u201cidentity crisis\u201d with Brexit. But he says: \u201cThank God I was born in the UK, because I wanted to go into comedy. This is the right place for it. There\u2019s an amazing literary tradition here. We make the best films and television in the world. We\u2019re innovators. We\u2019re funny. It\u2019s a country with the mostly highly developed sense of humour, anywhere. But why can\u2019t we celebrate all that and just be happy that we can do that?\u201d In his own ironic way, Iannucci is that celebration, and one that is well worth celebrating. The Personal History of David Copperfield opens in the UK on 24 January. Avenue 5 starts on 22 January, 10pm, Sky One Four of Iannucci\u2019s finest, chosen by Guy Lodge The Thick of It (2005-2012) Running irregularly from 2005 to 2012, Iannucci\u2019s inventively foul-mouthed sitcom set a new bar for British political comedy, exploring the world of spin and red tape in the fictional Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship with both aching accuracy and a riotous sense of farce. Its 2009 big-screen spinoff, In the Loop, was just as darkly hilarious and landed Iannucci an Oscar nomination. Veep (2012-2019) When Iannucci crossed the pond to bring his brand of inner-government satire to Washington, many assumed he\u2019d be somewhat defanged by American producers, but his pin-sharp White House takedown proved doubters wrong. Led by the impeccable Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a chaos-inclined vice-president (and eventual commander-in-chief), the Emmy-laden HBO sitcom took America into the Trump era, amping up the savagery all the way. The Death of Stalin (2017) Iannucci\u2019s second film as director emphatically proved his political nous has no geographical or historical restrictions. Dramatising the anarchic Kremlin fallout following the Soviet leader\u2019s demise in 1953, it daringly cast a transatlantic ensemble using a tangle of British and American accents, making for a mordant exercise in gallows humour with oddly universal resonance \u2013 and an unexpectedly poignant streak. The Personal History of David Copperfield (2019) Charles Dickens\u2019s authorial voice is so pungently distinctive that you might expect it to clash with Iannucci\u2019s zingy contemporary style, but they make surprisingly jolly bedfellows. His rollicking, beautifully designed take on the oft-adapted novel keeps the tragicomic romp lavishly in period, but freshens things up with colour-blind casting and a pointed nod to contemporary class wars.",

I remember it was far better than any of the action pictures I took that game.</p> <h2>Didier Drogba, Champions League final, Munich \u2013 19 May 2012</h2> <p><em>500mm lens, 1/800 f4, ISO 2500</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2986bb04f6cf286e1bb5fb5eb51b9c8a830120b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2986bb04f6cf286e1bb5fb5eb51b9c8a830120b8/0_0_3437_2178/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Didier Drogba of Chelsea prays during the penalty shoot-out during the Bayern Munich v Chelsea Champions League Final at the Fussball Arena Munchen on 19th May 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In the middle of the penalty shootout, Chelsea were trailing. The players looked dejected except Didier Drogba, who had rescued his side with a late equaliser in normal time. He started to pray. Maybe this paid off as Bayern Munich missed two penalties, leaving Drogba to score the winning spot-kick. Penalty shootouts are great for pictures but very hard to photograph as you need cameras pointing in various places at the same time. There are so many decisions to make quickly and, with such high stakes, you don\u2019t want to make the wrong choice.</p> <h2>Chris Hoy, men\u2019s keirin final, London Olympics \u2013 7 August 2012</h2> <p><em>420mm lens, 1/800th f4, ISO 2000</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebef9256fc1358b0ad70eb09c7656735f442e0b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebef9256fc1358b0ad70eb09c7656735f442e0b9/0_0_3719_2483/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Chris Hoy poses with his gold medal after winning the men\u2019s keirin final and so becoming the most successful British Olympian ever during day eleven of the London Olympics at the Olympic Velodrome on August 7th 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This was the day Chris Hoy beat Steve Redgrave\u2019s record to become Britain\u2019s greatest Olympian in terms of gold medals. So I wanted to illustrate this by going tight on his face and the beautiful medal. It was imperative to get a dark background that showed off the medal to its best. He is such a gentleman that after posing for the photos he thanked us all. Not many top sportsmen do that.</p> <h2>Mo Farah, men\u2019s 5,000m final, London Olympics \u2013 11 August 2012</h2> <p><em>200mm lens, 1/800 f5, ISO 1600</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a398d365963493c790530f0c23473fb881ee2835\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a398d365963493c790530f0c23473fb881ee2835/0_0_4088_2656/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mo Farah of Great Britain reacts as he crosses the finishing line to win the men\u2019s 5000m on day fifteen of the London 2012 Olympic Games at the Olympic Stadium on August 11, 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When setting up for the final session of athletics in the main stadium, I knew the story of the night would be if Mo Farah completed the historic double of 10,000m and 5,000m victories. I managed to bag a decent spot for a tight shot of him crossing the line, so I set up a remote camera with a wider angle designed specifically to include a lot of the crowd. As the race was run at 7.30pm I knew there would be plenty of daylight to light up the stands. I was trying to create a frame that wasn\u2019t just about an individual winning. More I wanted a feeling of national jubilation, a united Britain, celebrating the wonderful achievements of a Somali immigrant. I look back at this frame now and wonder how times have changed.</p> <h2>Ellie Simmonds, women\u2019s S6 400m freestyle final, London Paralympics \u2013 1 September 2012</h2> <p><em>500mm lens, 1/1000 f5.6, ISO 2500</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e672e98c07a338d7063bb98f7f9df01f12bacd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e672e98c07a338d7063bb98f7f9df01f12bacd3/0_0_2530_1682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eleanor Simmonds of Great Britain starts to cry after she wins the Womens S6 400m freestyle final in a new World Record on day three of the London 2012 Paralympic Games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Just after finishing her race and realising she had won, Ellie Simmonds started to sob. She had been in a titanic battle with the American Victoria Arlen, definitely the best race I saw at the Aquatics Centre that summer. The then teenager was one of the faces of the London Paralympics and endured enormous pressure after being so successful in Beijing four years earlier.</p> <h2>The Kop spells it out, Liverpool v Manchester United \u2013 23 September 2012</h2> <p><em>58mm lens, 1/500 f5, ISO 640</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a92364f868c9d457f53681cc304552380e17e2d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a92364f868c9d457f53681cc304552380e17e2d0/0_0_3816_2368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mosaic on The Kop before the game reads \u201cThe Truth\u201d after the recent publication of the Hillsborough Report threw a completely new light on the death of 96 fans in 1989, just before kick off in the Liverpool v Manchester United Premier League match at Anfield in September 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"621\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In September that year, the Hillsborough Independent Panel revealed for the first the full scale of the establishment cover-up of the 1989 disaster. Liverpool\u2019s following home game was against Manchester United. Just before kick-off the Kop formed a mosaic. I stood right next to the goal so I could shoot straight into the Kop as the players lined up to start.</p> <h2>Sir Alex Ferguson, The Hawthorns \u2013 9 May 2013</h2> <p><em>640mm lens, 1/1000 f5.6, ISO 400</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b0cfff8d2a897ae0ed7ca4d0e5e0f08992c71b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b0cfff8d2a897ae0ed7ca4d0e5e0f08992c71b5/0_0_3178_2060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Alex Ferguson gestures to the United fans after the West Bromwich Albion versus Manchester United Premier League match at The Hawthorns stadium in May 2013 , his final match as United manager before retiring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Sir Alex Ferguson gestures to Manchester United\u2019s fans immediately after the 5-5 draw at West Brom \u2013 his final match before retiring. I wanted to get in very close to his face, so I put a 1.4x converter on my 500mm lens. I should have known Fergie wouldn\u2019t shed a tear, he is far too hard for that. But I liked this determined and strong final pose as his players applauded behind him. Unfortunately for me this day will also be remembered for the local steward who placed himself in front of Ferguson as he bowed on the pitch thus ruining it for the mass of photographers. He then went on to shake the United manager\u2019s hand. You can imagine the earful we gave that steward afterwards.</p> <h2>Andy Murray, men\u2019s singles final, Wimbledon \u2013 7 July 2013</h2> <p><em>300mm lens, 1/1000 f5.6, ISO 400</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f1a853414864373b4f280c35b28a4f860cd3863\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f1a853414864373b4f280c35b28a4f860cd3863/0_0_4237_2811/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Murray lifts the trophy after the mens singles final against Novak Djokovic on Centre Court during Wimbledon 2013 day thirteen in July 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Early that day I was interviewed by Wimbledon TV and asked how I would react if Andy Murray won. I said I didn\u2019t quite know and didn\u2019t really want to know; I tried to block it out of my mind by saying Novak Djokovic would be victorious. This was me trying to take my own emotions out of the final. So that afternoon, when my prediction was proved decisively wrong, I reverted to auto-pilot, using my experience of covering nearly 20 finals there. This is one of my favourites \u2013 the expression on his face, picked out by the sunlight as he finally gets his hands on the famous trophy, a mixture of relief, joy and possibly disbelief. I look back at this and think that day was really something special.</p> <h2>England win the Ashes, Durham \u2013 12 August 2013</h2> <p><em>82mm lens, 1/800 f6.3, ISO 400</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"a2bbdc84ce624f0327f9239371fc6b61bdeb018c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2bbdc84ce624f0327f9239371fc6b61bdeb018c/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian batsman Peter Siddle hits a ball from bowler Stuart Broad to Jimmy Anderson at mid-off to give England the match and a 3-0 series victory during day four of the fourth Ashes Test match between England and Australia on August 2013 at Chester-le-Street, Durham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Australian batsman Peter Siddle lobs a catch straight to Jimmy Anderson at mid-off to give England the match and victory in the series. A few minutes earlier I was positioned straight on to the wicket at ground level where most of the other photographers were, when the most gorgeous evening light broke through threatening storm clouds. The view at Durham, over the pitch and across to Lumley Castle, is one of the best in cricket so I took a gamble and moved into the stands. As the final wicket fell I got this picture. My next frame was completely blocked by the arms of celebrating spectators.</p> <h2>Luis Su\u00e1rez advert, Copacabana Beach, Brazil \u2013 25 June 2014</h2> <p><em>50mm lens, 1/200 f2.8, ISO 1250</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c637eea11238143727f2b4263fddfa30d3f6637\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c637eea11238143727f2b4263fddfa30d3f6637/0_0_5320_3535/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Argentinian fan poses in front of an Adidas advert pretending to be bitten by Luis Suarez at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro in June 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was the day after the infamous Su\u00e1rez bite in the Uruguay v Italy World Cup match. So as the controversy started to engulf the tournament, I headed back to a strange advert I had noticed a couple of weeks earlier, hopeful that something may be happening there. I wasn\u2019t disappointed; it was great fun seeing fans from all over the world posing in different ways. I shot the pictures and filed them quickly. The response on social media to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2014/jun/26/world-cup-2014-luis-suarez-advert-bite\">that simple gallery</a> was amazing. Apparently it was even trending on Twitter in Paris.</p> <h2>Men\u2019s squash final, Glasgow Commonwealth Games \u2013 28 July 2014</h2> <p><em>44mm lens, 1/1600 f3.5, ISO 5000</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff35fe986f49e0d424fc4ab507c251095cccdfd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff35fe986f49e0d424fc4ab507c251095cccdfd2/0_0_4872_3048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Matthew of England in between James Willstrop of England and his reflection during the Commonwealth Games mens squash gold medal match at Scotstoun Sports Campus, Glasgow in July 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"626\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I managed to blag a shooting position right \u2018by the tin\u2019 shooting low down through the glass wall. As the final went on, I shifted position from the forehand side to the backhand. I realised by putting my lens right up against a glass-supporting strut in front of me I could achieve an amazing reflection. It wasn\u2019t like a mirror, which is opaque, as you could also see through it. All I had to do was wait for the action to occur in exactly the right spot. I have been accused of tampering with this image in Photoshop. I admit it\u2019s hard to work out but I swear it hasn\u2019t been altered. Firstly, I am not allowed by my editorial code to do that but I\u2019m also rubbish at Photoshop and don\u2019t posses the necessary skills. Also this final was tight on deadline which meant I had to file immediately after the match, giving me no time for any retouching.</p> <h2>Men\u2019s 10,000m final, Glasgow Commonwealth Games \u2013 1 August 2014</h2> <p><em>70mm lens, 1/2000 f5, ISO 200</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"db2d6c72a3d55acbc6b04087b671ba9aeeb0e8bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db2d6c72a3d55acbc6b04087b671ba9aeeb0e8bf/0_0_4514_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The runners in the Commonwealth Games men\u2019s 10,000m final during athletics at Hampden Park, Glasgow in August 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was a golden, sunlit evening in Glasgow, a rare occurrence that I had to make the most of. For a couple of hours I walked around the stadium, working on angles, trying to find the best spots to shoot the lengthening shadows. Luckily the 10,000m final was at exactly the right time. The light was perfect for only a few laps before the sun disappeared behind the back of the stands.</p> <h2>Michael Kacer, Invictus Games, Lee Valley Athletics Centre \u2013 11 September 2014</h2> <p><em>102mm lens, 1/1600 f2.8, ISO 500</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8f0e01da5ad3ba91ff5f85780214d037f9d94b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8f0e01da5ad3ba91ff5f85780214d037f9d94b8/0_0_3317_2201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Kacer of USA competing in the mens shot put IF1 final during the athletics competition on Day One of the Invictus Games at Lee Valley Athletics Stadium in Edmonton in September 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I headed off to the first day of the inaugural Invictus Games, I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it. But when I saw this veteran with one arm missing, a scar down the side of his face and distinctive contact lenses, I knew I could get a striking image. Lying down behind the shot put circle enabled me to shoot up and use the cloudy sky as a clean background. I also had the lens wide open to throw all the focus on to that amazing, determined face.</p> <h2>Rafael Nadal\u2019s sweat drops, Wimbledon \u2013 3o June 2015</h2> <p><em>700mm lens, 1/1250 f5.6, ISO 400</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"99e8d35e82be000d6cdd5a846ffca5bd938ced35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99e8d35e82be000d6cdd5a846ffca5bd938ced35/0_0_3778_2502/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sweat drops off Rafael Nadal on the hottest day of the year as he struggles in his match with Thomas Bellucci on Court One during day two of Wimbledon 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Rafael Nadal was struggling to beat a low-ranked opponent during an early round on the No 1 Court. It was the hottest day of the year and I had noticed at the change of ends how the sweat was pouring off him while reaching down to pick up a drink by his chair. By putting a converter on my lens I could get in really tight to his face, isolating the drops.</p> <h2>Japan v South Africa, Rugby World Cup, Brighton \u2013 19 September 2015</h2> <p><em>500mm lens 1/1250 f4.5 ISO 2500</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9519e46c25752cd87f42f920a4e0336c1ef68af7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9519e46c25752cd87f42f920a4e0336c1ef68af7/0_0_3650_2394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Leitch and Fumiaki Tanaka of Japan try to stop Handre Pollard during the South Africa v Japan Pool B Rugby World Cup match at Brighton Community Stadium in September 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Like everyone else that day, I was expecting an easy Springbok victory. The ground at Brighton was very cramped and, as Japan had many photographers there, I was quite happy to plump for a position shooting South Africa attack for both halves. I just couldn\u2019t believe it, watching the winning try from the other end of the pitch. Luckily getting this picture helped soothe the disappointment of not being in the right place in the final minute.</p> <h2>Carnage at the Chair, Grand National, Aintree \u2013 9 April 2016</h2> <p><em>70mm lens 1/5000 f4 ISO 2000</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"a6dfedd925c139630a7aa75684bbca3096ac35ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6dfedd925c139630a7aa75684bbca3096ac35ae/0_0_3587_2220/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nina Carberry flies off Sir Des Champs as they fall at The Chair fence during the 2016 Grand National at Aintree Racecourse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"619\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I have a well-rehearsed plan at the Grand National \u2013 one that gives me as many angles and viewpoints as possible. Part of this strategy involves putting a couple of remote cameras at the largest fence on the course. That year I had a camera placed either side of the landing area. It was a filthy day, which meant the ground was soft and the horses were tiring. Luckily one of the remotes captured the moment Nina Carberry flew off her horse Sir Des Champs. For 25 years I had photographed the Chair during the Grand National, hoping one day my perseverance would pay off, and that day it did: this frame won best sports picture at the World Press Photo awards.</p> <h2>West Ham v Manchester United, the final goal at the Boleyn Ground \u2013 10 May 2016</h2> <p><em>24mm lens 1/100 f8 ISO 2500</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bac582ea0a1c984adb2a698fdfc92bbd5f847880\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bac582ea0a1c984adb2a698fdfc92bbd5f847880/0_0_4632_2902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winston Reid scores the winning goal and the final goal to be scored at the Boleyn Ground during the West Ham United v Manchester United Premier League match in May 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"627\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>From my position, low down and by the dug-outs, I knew I wouldn\u2019t have a good angle to achieve an historic reminder of the final game. So I managed to get permission to clamp a remote camera high up on the scaffolding supporting the temporary TV studio. Here I could see it all \u2013 the ground, the pitch, the players, the lights, the fans. It was a huge stroke of luck for me that the final and winning goal, scored by West Ham\u2019s Winston Reid, happened at the right end.

Seeing a solitary England fan, dressed proudly in his replica kit from the early 90s, marooned amongst a sea of proud, scarlet-clad Welshmen. I just wish I\u2019d seen his reaction when England scored their winning goal. England may have been victorious that day but they departed the tournament in disgrace losing to Iceland, while Wales went on to the dizzy heights of the semi-finals.</p> <h2>Serena Williams, women\u2019s singles final, Wimbledon \u2013 9 July 2016</h2> <p><em>300mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 640</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"574e508501a6fe8c40cb788f586198d027d22a0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/574e508501a6fe8c40cb788f586198d027d22a0a/0_0_4983_3265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Serena Williams celebrates during her victory over Angelique Kerber in the women\u2019s singles final during day twelve of the 2016 Wimbledon tennis championships.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Without doubt my favourite woman to photograph. I have found it very difficult to pick out my best image of Serena from the last decade. Eventually I plumped on this one, her beating Angelique Kerber in the Wimbledon final of 2016. I wanted a picture that demonstrated her power, strength and determination. On Centre Court some photographers have fantastic seats, low down and very close to the action. When Serena doesn\u2019t hold back like this you can really feel the force.</p> <h2>Men\u2019s synchro diving final, Rio Olympics \u2013 8 August 2016</h2> <p><em>70mm lens 1/8000 f6.3 ISO 200</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e607b20abc0429795bdd26251045bd6239e636c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e607b20abc0429795bdd26251045bd6239e636c2/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Daley (left) and Daniel Goodfellow of GB competing in the mens 10m synchro diving competition at the Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre during day three of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janiero.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is Britain\u2019s Tom Daley and Daniel Goodfellow competing outside at the Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre. Above the top board I noticed a load of scaffolding and metal poles. It looked really messy, almost as if the divers were jumping off a building site. Poor planning and a lack of money meant many venues had a half-finished feel to them. The weather that day was a bit overcast with the sun struggling to break through. I wanted a bit of colour to this picture so I tweaked the colour balance of my camera to warm it up and give this smoggy feel.</p> <h2>Great Britain v China, men\u2019s team fencing, Rio Olympics \u2013 12 August 2016</h2> <p><em>120mm lens 1/2000 f4.5 ISO 3200 (double exposure)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"a0a615ecb7ed7e5cfa73c39313597ae916f8c576\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0a615ecb7ed7e5cfa73c39313597ae916f8c576/0_0_4812_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A double exposure during the Great Britain v China team foil fencing match for 5th place at the Barra Olympic Park during day seven of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janiero.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Olympic fencing is one of my favourite events to cover.

Also it\u2019s not one of the high-profile events where the pressure is on not to miss a vital moment. I managed to work out how I could combine in the camera two frames in a striking multiple exposure. The colours of the different pistes, allied with the contrasting angles, created an image that reminded me of the Union Jack. It was just a matter of time and practice before finally getting the fencers in the right place.</p> <h2>Women\u2019s beam final, Rio Olympics \u2013 15 August 2016</h2> <p><em>44mm lens 1/2000 f4 ISO 3200</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4ce10849de2c105d5022f49ec7c05715997bda5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ce10849de2c105d5022f49ec7c05715997bda5f/0_0_4052_2645/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fan Yilin of China during the women\u2019s beam apparatus final at the Rio Olympic Arena in Barra Olympic Park during day ten of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janiero.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The diminutive Fan Yilin from China competes on the beam during the apparatus finals in Rio. She is only 4ft 10in tall so I deliberately shot this image with a wider view to emphasise her tiny frame especially when leaping high. Gymnastics is one of those sports I rarely get to photograph, so it\u2019s refreshing to work on something different.</p> <h2>Infrared image of Wimbledon \u2013 10 July 2017</h2> <p><em>24mm lens 1/1000 f9 ISO 400</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"f65ebf3ba9b4b6bb887333818cad43b312ba10e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f65ebf3ba9b4b6bb887333818cad43b312ba10e9/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Garbine Muguruza volleys during her victory over Angelique Kerber on Court Two on day seven of the 2017 Wimbledon tennis championships, shot with an infra-red camera.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I had seen images taken with infrared cameras by landscape photographers and had noticed how it rendered colours, especially greens, in a unique fashion. Knowing Wimbledon was a sea of greens, I thought it might be interesting to see what could happen. I also wanted to show a place that is so familiar in a very different, almost surreal way. I got a normal Canon 7D camera which had the sensor adapted to read only infrared light and then produced<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/jul/13/wimbledon-2017-tennis-in-infra-red-in-pictures\"> a gallery of images </a>taken around the grounds during the fortnight.

Her long braided hair makes for great pictures, but it\u2019s especially graphic in the high jump. For me it was just a case of getting the background clean and waiting for the sun to come out so as to light up her face and hair perfectly.</p> <h2>Usain Bolt\u2019s agony in his final race, London \u2013 11 August 2017</h2> <p><em>400mm lens 1/1600 f3.5 ISO 4000</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fc14215047d26dc9c8bfcac307da41d2640c917\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fc14215047d26dc9c8bfcac307da41d2640c917/0_0_2763_1700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In his final race before retirement Usain Bolt of Jamaica shouts out in agony as he stops running due to a sudden injury in the final of the mens 4 x 100m relay during day nine of the IAAF World Athletics Championships 2017 at the Olympic Stadium, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"615\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was Usain Bolt\u2019s final race before retirement and everyone expected him to go out in a blaze of glory. I was tracking him as he sprinted down the home straight when suddenly he pulled up with an injury. It was a sad end for such a huge global superstar, an athlete who has provided so many amazing moments for me as well as the sporting public.</p> <h2>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Stamford Bridge \u2013 20 October 2018</h2> <p><em>560mm lens 1/5000 f4 ISO 800</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"586fca5bd16a1dc66e8b636a2f0a4a6b3d27ad93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/586fca5bd16a1dc66e8b636a2f0a4a6b3d27ad93/0_0_2273_1497/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jose Mourinho (centre) has to be restrained during a tunnel fracas after the late Chelsea equaliser during the Chelsea v Manchester United Premier League match at Stamford Bridge in October 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Recently I wrote an article <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/22/welcome-back-jose-mourinho-football-photographers-tom-jenkins\">welcoming back Jos\u00e9</a> after being appointed Spurs manager. In it I mentioned this picture and how one of my Twitter followers compared it to the Caravaggio painting The Taking of Christ. That tweet went a bit crazy for a while. I thought that bizarre enough but this month the tale had another quirky twist. Again on Twitter I was told this picture, or rather Caravaggio\u2019s, was a perfect example of the Fibonacci spiral. He was a famous 12<sup>th</sup> century Italian mathematician who invented the Fibonacci sequence which stated each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This applied to art is an expression of the Rule of Thirds \u2013 a principle that gives a more appealing flow to an image. What makes this even stranger is the person telling me about Fibonacci was Carol Decker, the lead singer of the 80s pop group T\u2019Pau!</p> <h2>England win the Cricket World Cup, Lord\u2019s \u2013 14 July 2019</h2> <p><em>600mm lens 1/1600 f5.6 ISO 800</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"55195e1b73a04f7463270222e58b50511e539414\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55195e1b73a04f7463270222e58b50511e539414/0_0_3538_2179/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler runs out New Zealand batsman Martin Guptill off the last ball of the superover to give England victory during the England v New Zealand ICC Cricket World Cup Final 2019 at Lord's Cricket Ground, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>More than five months later and I still can\u2019t believe what I witnessed that day at Lord\u2019s. Compiling this decade review has given me the chance to revisit some wonderful moments \u2013 but nothing compares to this. For sheer sporting drama it takes the gold medal. England beating New Zealand to win the World Cup off the very last ball of a super over, with the teams tied after 50 overs each. I remember taking a deep breath before that final ball, trying to get my heart rate down, and then just trusting my instincts. Fortunately the run-out happened at the right end for me and I managed to get it.</p> <h2>South Africa lift the Rugby World Cup, Yokohama \u2013 2 November 2019</h2> <p><em>400mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 3200</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"115cd2f430030ac5d63bc37a66b3cb28b9c14cf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/115cd2f430030ac5d63bc37a66b3cb28b9c14cf5/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South African captain Siya Kolisi lifts up the Webb Ellis Cup for the first time at the presentation ceremony after the England v South Africa Rugby World Cup 2019 Final at Yokohama International Stadium, Japan in November 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This was a day of mixed emotions for me. For obvious reasons I had wanted England to win the final but I always try to put personal feelings aside when I\u2019m shooting a game \u2013 it\u2019s my job to be a neutral observer. The key picture, as it so often is, was the trophy lift. This one had far greater significance. Siya Kolisi, the first black player to captain his country, raising the Webb Ellis Cup aloft. For many years rugby was the sport of the white minority, with black players banned from playing under the apartheid regime. Kolisi had been born into extreme poverty but here he was lifting the trophy up and becoming an inspiration, a beacon of hope for a troubled country.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This is a collection of images I have shot during the last decade. I wasn\u2019t selecting them because they were necessarily the biggest moments or the greatest stars \u2013 it was purely because I liked them as pictures and some had nice stories attached. What jumped out at me when choosing them is there should be far more sportswomen featured. The amount of women\u2019s sport I cover has gradually increased but if I get to do a decade round-up in 2029, I want there to be a far more even balance between the sexes. Fen skating, Cambridgeshire \u2013 9 January 2010 14mm lens, 1/1250th f9 ISO 320 The start of the decade brought freezing temperatures across Britain. This caused carnage with the fixture list so my mind turned to finding a sport that was thriving in the sub-zero temperatures. I discovered that for the first time since 1997 organised skating races were being held on a flooded field in the Fens. Luckily for me it was a beautiful day and produced scenes that reminded me of a Bruegel painting. It was hard to believe I was in the heart of England. The event hasn\u2019t happened since. Cheltenham spectators \u2013 17 March 2010 85mm lens, 1/500th f3.5 ISO 1000 Taken at one of my favourite events of the year, this sums up the atmosphere at the Cheltenham Festival. Wherever you look there are pictures to be had both on the course and off. I spotted these two ladies and waited, hoping they would react in some way or another. Luckily for me but unluckily for horse and rider, a horse careered through the railings. Fortunately, everyone emerged unscathed. Track Cycling World Cup, Manchester \u2013 20 February 2011 190mm lens, 1/4th f16 ISO 200 Team pursuit qualifying lasts for more than an hour with teams competing against the clock one at a time. Not exactly thrilling stuff but it meant I had plenty of time to play with slow shutter speeds and lighting. I placed a strobe on the inside of the track and worked on different combinations of slow shutter speed and either keeping the camera still as the cyclists passed or reverse panning. I don\u2019t often get the opportunity to experiment like this during a top event; it was a chance to create virtually my own little studio and have some fun. Swansea mascot, Emirates Stadium \u2013 10 September 2011 500mm lens, 1/1000th f5.6 ISO 800 As the Swansea team gathered for their huddle before kick-off, their young mascot looked disgruntled to be left out. It\u2019s highly unusual to get a sweet, soft picture such as this at a high-profile Premier League match. I remember it was far better than any of the action pictures I took that game. Didier Drogba, Champions League final, Munich \u2013 19 May 2012 500mm lens, 1/800 f4, ISO 2500 In the middle of the penalty shootout, Chelsea were trailing. The players looked dejected except Didier Drogba, who had rescued his side with a late equaliser in normal time. He started to pray. Maybe this paid off as Bayern Munich missed two penalties, leaving Drogba to score the winning spot-kick. Penalty shootouts are great for pictures but very hard to photograph as you need cameras pointing in various places at the same time. There are so many decisions to make quickly and, with such high stakes, you don\u2019t want to make the wrong choice. Chris Hoy, men\u2019s keirin final, London Olympics \u2013 7 August 2012 420mm lens, 1/800th f4, ISO 2000 This was the day Chris Hoy beat Steve Redgrave\u2019s record to become Britain\u2019s greatest Olympian in terms of gold medals. So I wanted to illustrate this by going tight on his face and the beautiful medal. It was imperative to get a dark background that showed off the medal to its best. He is such a gentleman that after posing for the photos he thanked us all. Not many top sportsmen do that. Mo Farah, men\u2019s 5,000m final, London Olympics \u2013 11 August 2012 200mm lens, 1/800 f5, ISO 1600 When setting up for the final session of athletics in the main stadium, I knew the story of the night would be if Mo Farah completed the historic double of 10,000m and 5,000m victories. I managed to bag a decent spot for a tight shot of him crossing the line, so I set up a remote camera with a wider angle designed specifically to include a lot of the crowd. As the race was run at 7.30pm I knew there would be plenty of daylight to light up the stands. I was trying to create a frame that wasn\u2019t just about an individual winning. More I wanted a feeling of national jubilation, a united Britain, celebrating the wonderful achievements of a Somali immigrant. I look back at this frame now and wonder how times have changed. Ellie Simmonds, women\u2019s S6 400m freestyle final, London Paralympics \u2013 1 September 2012 500mm lens, 1/1000 f5.6, ISO 2500 Just after finishing her race and realising she had won, Ellie Simmonds started to sob. She had been in a titanic battle with the American Victoria Arlen, definitely the best race I saw at the Aquatics Centre that summer. The then teenager was one of the faces of the London Paralympics and endured enormous pressure after being so successful in Beijing four years earlier. The Kop spells it out, Liverpool v Manchester United \u2013 23 September 2012 58mm lens, 1/500 f5, ISO 640 In September that year, the Hillsborough Independent Panel revealed for the first the full scale of the establishment cover-up of the 1989 disaster. Liverpool\u2019s following home game was against Manchester United. Just before kick-off the Kop formed a mosaic. I stood right next to the goal so I could shoot straight into the Kop as the players lined up to start. Sir Alex Ferguson, The Hawthorns \u2013 9 May 2013 640mm lens, 1/1000 f5.6, ISO 400 Sir Alex Ferguson gestures to Manchester United\u2019s fans immediately after the 5-5 draw at West Brom \u2013 his final match before retiring. I wanted to get in very close to his face, so I put a 1.4x converter on my 500mm lens. I should have known Fergie wouldn\u2019t shed a tear, he is far too hard for that. But I liked this determined and strong final pose as his players applauded behind him. Unfortunately for me this day will also be remembered for the local steward who placed himself in front of Ferguson as he bowed on the pitch thus ruining it for the mass of photographers. He then went on to shake the United manager\u2019s hand. You can imagine the earful we gave that steward afterwards. Andy Murray, men\u2019s singles final, Wimbledon \u2013 7 July 2013 300mm lens, 1/1000 f5.6, ISO 400 Early that day I was interviewed by Wimbledon TV and asked how I would react if Andy Murray won. I said I didn\u2019t quite know and didn\u2019t really want to know; I tried to block it out of my mind by saying Novak Djokovic would be victorious. This was me trying to take my own emotions out of the final. So that afternoon, when my prediction was proved decisively wrong, I reverted to auto-pilot, using my experience of covering nearly 20 finals there. This is one of my favourites \u2013 the expression on his face, picked out by the sunlight as he finally gets his hands on the famous trophy, a mixture of relief, joy and possibly disbelief. I look back at this and think that day was really something special. England win the Ashes, Durham \u2013 12 August 2013 82mm lens, 1/800 f6.3, ISO 400 Australian batsman Peter Siddle lobs a catch straight to Jimmy Anderson at mid-off to give England the match and victory in the series. A few minutes earlier I was positioned straight on to the wicket at ground level where most of the other photographers were, when the most gorgeous evening light broke through threatening storm clouds. The view at Durham, over the pitch and across to Lumley Castle, is one of the best in cricket so I took a gamble and moved into the stands. As the final wicket fell I got this picture. My next frame was completely blocked by the arms of celebrating spectators. Luis Su\u00e1rez advert, Copacabana Beach, Brazil \u2013 25 June 2014 50mm lens, 1/200 f2.8, ISO 1250 It was the day after the infamous Su\u00e1rez bite in the Uruguay v Italy World Cup match. So as the controversy started to engulf the tournament, I headed back to a strange advert I had noticed a couple of weeks earlier, hopeful that something may be happening there. I wasn\u2019t disappointed; it was great fun seeing fans from all over the world posing in different ways. I shot the pictures and filed them quickly. The response on social media to that simple gallery was amazing. Apparently it was even trending on Twitter in Paris. Men\u2019s squash final, Glasgow Commonwealth Games \u2013 28 July 2014 44mm lens, 1/1600 f3.5, ISO 5000 I managed to blag a shooting position right \u2018by the tin\u2019 shooting low down through the glass wall. As the final went on, I shifted position from the forehand side to the backhand. I realised by putting my lens right up against a glass-supporting strut in front of me I could achieve an amazing reflection. It wasn\u2019t like a mirror, which is opaque, as you could also see through it. All I had to do was wait for the action to occur in exactly the right spot. I have been accused of tampering with this image in Photoshop. I admit it\u2019s hard to work out but I swear it hasn\u2019t been altered. Firstly, I am not allowed by my editorial code to do that but I\u2019m also rubbish at Photoshop and don\u2019t posses the necessary skills. Also this final was tight on deadline which meant I had to file immediately after the match, giving me no time for any retouching. Men\u2019s 10,000m final, Glasgow Commonwealth Games \u2013 1 August 2014 70mm lens, 1/2000 f5, ISO 200 It was a golden, sunlit evening in Glasgow, a rare occurrence that I had to make the most of. For a couple of hours I walked around the stadium, working on angles, trying to find the best spots to shoot the lengthening shadows. Luckily the 10,000m final was at exactly the right time. The light was perfect for only a few laps before the sun disappeared behind the back of the stands. Michael Kacer, Invictus Games, Lee Valley Athletics Centre \u2013 11 September 2014 102mm lens, 1/1600 f2.8, ISO 500 When I headed off to the first day of the inaugural Invictus Games, I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it. But when I saw this veteran with one arm missing, a scar down the side of his face and distinctive contact lenses, I knew I could get a striking image. Lying down behind the shot put circle enabled me to shoot up and use the cloudy sky as a clean background. I also had the lens wide open to throw all the focus on to that amazing, determined face. Rafael Nadal\u2019s sweat drops, Wimbledon \u2013 3o June 2015 700mm lens, 1/1250 f5.6, ISO 400 Rafael Nadal was struggling to beat a low-ranked opponent during an early round on the No 1 Court. It was the hottest day of the year and I had noticed at the change of ends how the sweat was pouring off him while reaching down to pick up a drink by his chair. By putting a converter on my lens I could get in really tight to his face, isolating the drops. Japan v South Africa, Rugby World Cup, Brighton \u2013 19 September 2015 500mm lens 1/1250 f4.5 ISO 2500 Like everyone else that day, I was expecting an easy Springbok victory. The ground at Brighton was very cramped and, as Japan had many photographers there, I was quite happy to plump for a position shooting South Africa attack for both halves. I just couldn\u2019t believe it, watching the winning try from the other end of the pitch. Luckily getting this picture helped soothe the disappointment of not being in the right place in the final minute. Carnage at the Chair, Grand National, Aintree \u2013 9 April 2016 70mm lens 1/5000 f4 ISO 2000 I have a well-rehearsed plan at the Grand National \u2013 one that gives me as many angles and viewpoints as possible. Part of this strategy involves putting a couple of remote cameras at the largest fence on the course. That year I had a camera placed either side of the landing area. It was a filthy day, which meant the ground was soft and the horses were tiring. Luckily one of the remotes captured the moment Nina Carberry flew off her horse Sir Des Champs. For 25 years I had photographed the Chair during the Grand National, hoping one day my perseverance would pay off, and that day it did: this frame won best sports picture at the World Press Photo awards. West Ham v Manchester United, the final goal at the Boleyn Ground \u2013 10 May 2016 24mm lens 1/100 f8 ISO 2500 From my position, low down and by the dug-outs, I knew I wouldn\u2019t have a good angle to achieve an historic reminder of the final game. So I managed to get permission to clamp a remote camera high up on the scaffolding supporting the temporary TV studio. Here I could see it all \u2013 the ground, the pitch, the players, the lights, the fans. It was a huge stroke of luck for me that the final and winning goal, scored by West Ham\u2019s Winston Reid, happened at the right end. As I always try to say to myself: \u201cIf you don\u2019t try you never get.\u201d Wales v England, Euro 2016 match, Lens \u2013 16 June 2016 200mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 1000 This made me laugh. Seeing a solitary England fan, dressed proudly in his replica kit from the early 90s, marooned amongst a sea of proud, scarlet-clad Welshmen. I just wish I\u2019d seen his reaction when England scored their winning goal. England may have been victorious that day but they departed the tournament in disgrace losing to Iceland, while Wales went on to the dizzy heights of the semi-finals. Serena Williams, women\u2019s singles final, Wimbledon \u2013 9 July 2016 300mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 640 Without doubt my favourite woman to photograph. I have found it very difficult to pick out my best image of Serena from the last decade. Eventually I plumped on this one, her beating Angelique Kerber in the Wimbledon final of 2016. I wanted a picture that demonstrated her power, strength and determination. On Centre Court some photographers have fantastic seats, low down and very close to the action. When Serena doesn\u2019t hold back like this you can really feel the force. Men\u2019s synchro diving final, Rio Olympics \u2013 8 August 2016 70mm lens 1/8000 f6.3 ISO 200 This is Britain\u2019s Tom Daley and Daniel Goodfellow competing outside at the Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre. Above the top board I noticed a load of scaffolding and metal poles. It looked really messy, almost as if the divers were jumping off a building site. Poor planning and a lack of money meant many venues had a half-finished feel to them. The weather that day was a bit overcast with the sun struggling to break through. I wanted a bit of colour to this picture so I tweaked the colour balance of my camera to warm it up and give this smoggy feel. Great Britain v China, men\u2019s team fencing, Rio Olympics \u2013 12 August 2016 120mm lens 1/2000 f4.5 ISO 3200 (double exposure) Olympic fencing is one of my favourite events to cover. It is theatrically and dramatically lit which means photographers can have a lot of fun experimenting with exposures and shutter-speeds. Also it\u2019s not one of the high-profile events where the pressure is on not to miss a vital moment. I managed to work out how I could combine in the camera two frames in a striking multiple exposure. The colours of the different pistes, allied with the contrasting angles, created an image that reminded me of the Union Jack. It was just a matter of time and practice before finally getting the fencers in the right place. Women\u2019s beam final, Rio Olympics \u2013 15 August 2016 44mm lens 1/2000 f4 ISO 3200 The diminutive Fan Yilin from China competes on the beam during the apparatus finals in Rio. She is only 4ft 10in tall so I deliberately shot this image with a wider view to emphasise her tiny frame especially when leaping high. Gymnastics is one of those sports I rarely get to photograph, so it\u2019s refreshing to work on something different. Infrared image of Wimbledon \u2013 10 July 2017 24mm lens 1/1000 f9 ISO 400 I had seen images taken with infrared cameras by landscape photographers and had noticed how it rendered colours, especially greens, in a unique fashion. Knowing Wimbledon was a sea of greens, I thought it might be interesting to see what could happen. I also wanted to show a place that is so familiar in a very different, almost surreal way. I got a normal Canon 7D camera which had the sensor adapted to read only infrared light and then produced a gallery of images taken around the grounds during the fortnight. In this image of Court Two, the eventual women\u2019s champion Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza is volleying against Angelique Kerber. Nafi Thiam, World Athletics Championships, London \u2013 5 August 2017 400mm lens 1/4000 f4 ISO 400 The Belgian Olympic heptathlon champion, Nafi Thiam, was a model of consistency, easily winning her competition at the world championships. Her long braided hair makes for great pictures, but it\u2019s especially graphic in the high jump. For me it was just a case of getting the background clean and waiting for the sun to come out so as to light up her face and hair perfectly. Usain Bolt\u2019s agony in his final race, London \u2013 11 August 2017 400mm lens 1/1600 f3.5 ISO 4000 It was Usain Bolt\u2019s final race before retirement and everyone expected him to go out in a blaze of glory. I was tracking him as he sprinted down the home straight when suddenly he pulled up with an injury. It was a sad end for such a huge global superstar, an athlete who has provided so many amazing moments for me as well as the sporting public. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Stamford Bridge \u2013 20 October 2018 560mm lens 1/5000 f4 ISO 800 Recently I wrote an article welcoming back Jos\u00e9 after being appointed Spurs manager. In it I mentioned this picture and how one of my Twitter followers compared it to the Caravaggio painting The Taking of Christ. That tweet went a bit crazy for a while. I thought that bizarre enough but this month the tale had another quirky twist. Again on Twitter I was told this picture, or rather Caravaggio\u2019s, was a perfect example of the Fibonacci spiral. He was a famous 12th century Italian mathematician who invented the Fibonacci sequence which stated each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This applied to art is an expression of the Rule of Thirds \u2013 a principle that gives a more appealing flow to an image. What makes this even stranger is the person telling me about Fibonacci was Carol Decker, the lead singer of the 80s pop group T\u2019Pau! England win the Cricket World Cup, Lord\u2019s \u2013 14 July 2019 600mm lens 1/1600 f5.6 ISO 800 More than five months later and I still can\u2019t believe what I witnessed that day at Lord\u2019s. Compiling this decade review has given me the chance to revisit some wonderful moments \u2013 but nothing compares to this. For sheer sporting drama it takes the gold medal. England beating New Zealand to win the World Cup off the very last ball of a super over, with the teams tied after 50 overs each. I remember taking a deep breath before that final ball, trying to get my heart rate down, and then just trusting my instincts. Fortunately the run-out happened at the right end for me and I managed to get it. South Africa lift the Rugby World Cup, Yokohama \u2013 2 November 2019 400mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 3200 This was a day of mixed emotions for me. For obvious reasons I had wanted England to win the final but I always try to put personal feelings aside when I\u2019m shooting a game \u2013 it\u2019s my job to be a neutral observer. The key picture, as it so often is, was the trophy lift. This one had far greater significance. Siya Kolisi, the first black player to captain his country, raising the Webb Ellis Cup aloft. For many years rugby was the sport of the white minority, with black players banned from playing under the apartheid regime. Kolisi had been born into extreme poverty but here he was lifting the trophy up and becoming an inspiration, a beacon of hope for a troubled country.",

In what investigators claim is Italy\u2019s first conviction for labour trafficking of European citizens, Lucian Milea, 41, was convicted last week of running a trafficking ring that recruited dozens of women in Romania who were then forced into exploitation and prostitution on farms in Ragusa, Sicily. Ragusa is one of Italy\u2019s biggest producers of fruit and vegetables, which are exported to countries across the EU including the UK. A court heard that the women were forced to live in terrible conditions in outbuildings on farms without heating, were not paid for their manual labour, were given rotten food to eat, and were beaten and forced to have sex with their employers and other men. Two Romanian women were sentenced alongside Milea for aiding and abetting underage prostitution. The trial of another three Romanian nationals charged with human trafficking is ongoing.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme being broadcast on Monday, Carney said that although the financial sector was starting to cut back on investment in oil and gas companies, the process was not moving quickly enough. Carney, who will focus on his new role as UN special envoy for climate change and finance after he steps down from the governorship in the new year, agreed to appear on the programme for an edition edited by the climate crisis campaigner Greta Thunberg, one of several guest editors on Today over the holiday period. Carney has been one of the most vocal central bank governors on the need for the financial sector to do more to transition towards a zero-carbon economy. He told the programme that the climate crisis was a \u201ctragedy on the horizon\u201d and that more extreme weather events were inevitable. \u201cBy the time that the extreme events become so prevalent and so obvious, it will be too late to do anything about it,\u201d he said. Political leaders had to \u201cstart addressing future problems today\u201d. On the issue of whether investors should be divesting from companies in the fossil fuel sector, Carney said fund managers would \u201chave to make the judgment and justify to the people whose money it ultimately is\u201d. When pressed on whether pension funds should divest from oil and gas companies even if the returns were attractive, he replied: \u201cWell that hasn\u2019t been the case but they could make that argument.

A question for every company, every financial institution, every asset manager, pension fund or insurer: what\u2019s your plan?\u201d The Bank of England has said assets worth up to $20tn (\u00a316tn) could become worthless very quickly if the financial sector and business do not make a smooth transition towards a zero-carbon economy. In his interview, Carney urged climate change deniers to drop their opposition on the issue, saying: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford on this one to have selective information, spin, misdirection.\u201d One such sceptic is the former Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore, who guest-edited Today on Saturday and included in his programme a feature questioning the global consensus on the climate crisis.

Few have lived the high and lows of this decade as viscerally as DeRay Mckesson of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>The civil rights activist felt compelled to join spontaneous street demonstrations in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014, a week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/10/ferguson-five-years-on-from-the-police-shooting-of-michael-brown\">Michael Brown</a>, an 18-year-old African American man, was fatally shot by a white police officer.

What was so beautiful about it was people came out in the street in the early days and stayed in the street. What makes the current movement so different is that it wasn\u2019t started by an organisation, by institutions, by churches, by schools.</p> <p>\u201cIn our generation, it was the first time that we saw this type of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/23/decade-of-protest-occupy-wall-street-extinction-rebellion-gary-younge\">activism in the streets</a> that was widespread and caught on. There were certainly other demonstrations across the country that happened way before the death of Mike Brown, but this one was the phenomenon.</p> <p>\u201cTechnology lined up at the time. The police were so wild in a way that was so concentrated. The community was ready to engage. The media was present. All of the things happened in this one moment in a way that no person could have organised. It changed the country. It opened up a wave of activism across a host of areas and focused citizens in a way that is truly special.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63ff8d780ce5bf320ad4f100107dae36e91e70fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63ff8d780ce5bf320ad4f100107dae36e91e70fe/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators shout slogans during a march in St Louis, Missouri, on 23 November 2014 to protest the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators shout slogans during a march in St Louis, Missouri, on 23 November 2014 to protest the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brown\u2019s death fed into an awakening about the national crisis of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings\">law enforcement killing people of colour</a>. The demonstrators in Ferguson gained widespread attention. They marched all day and all night because police enforced a \u201cfive-second rule\u201d that meant no one could stand still during a protest. Mckesson\u2019s critiques of the policy on Twitter helped get it struck down in federal court.</p> <p>\u201cIf we stood still for more than five seconds, we were arrested,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were in the streets for 400 days. It\u2019s a long time and the police were relentless. Most people know Mike Brown\u2019s name, but the police killed 10 people after they killed Mike Brown so it didn\u2019t stop.</p> <p>\u201cThe protests spread across the country because the police had continued to kill people and with it you saw a generation find their public voice. People had always known these things. People talked about it and suddenly there was a broad community of not just people who identified as activists or organisers but who simply loved their community and knew that this was not the best version of it there could be.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/08/15/the-hashtag-blacklivesmatter-emerges-social-activism-on-twitter/\">According to the Pew Research Center</a>, the phrase \u201cblack lives matter\u201d was first used by a black community organiser <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/14/where-is-black-lives-matter-headed\">in a Facebook post</a> following the July 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African American. The hashtag, and the influence of the Black Lives Matter movement, accelerated greatly in August 2014 when Brown was killed, Pew noted.</p> <p>A new language for grassroots protest, social media and the mainstream media\u2019s understanding of them was taking shape. Its heirs have included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo</a>, giving a voice to victims of sexual harassment, the Women\u2019s March and Indivisible movement that followed Donald Trump\u2019s election, and the March for Our Lives, a response to a 2018 mass shooting at a school in Parkland, Florida.</p> <p>Mckesson continued: \u201cWith us, the media and mainstream society were learning how to talk and think about protest. And shortly, you\u2019d see it open up space for Parkland and open up space for the Women\u2019s March and open up space for Indivisible. By the time they came along, there was already a language, reporters knew how to talk about it, reporters understood it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"925397c84ee144427438d6994ee3dd949c0871c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/925397c84ee144427438d6994ee3dd949c0871c8/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A police officer patrols during a protest in support of the Black lives matter movement in New York on July 09, 2016.

It saw America lurch from Barack Obama, its first black president, to Donald Trump, who gave succour to white supremacists. Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton but threaded the needle of the electoral college by just 77,000 votes in three battleground states where <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/03/12/4-4-million-2012-obama-voters-stayed-home-in-2016-more-than-a-third-of-them-black/\">African American turnout was significantly down</a>.</p> <p>Mckesson reflected: \u201cThere was so much hope with Obama. There was so much promise, and then we saw in real time the promise fade away. You saw Trayvon get killed. You saw Mike Brown killed. You saw all these horrific things happen and it didn\u2019t seem like there was something on the other side.</p> <p>\u201cThe disillusionment hit right at that time. People would tell us to vote and we\u2019re like, \u2018I voted my entire life. I voted every election. I still got dragged out by police by my ankles. I still got arrested. I got shot at.\u2019 Voting didn\u2019t stop any of the bad things from happening. I think that people understood that and they inadvertently took that message to mean that voting didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>That was not Mckesson\u2019s own view. He voted for the leftwing insurgent senator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deray/status/801820396152557568?s=20\">Bernie Sanders</a> in the Democratic primary and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/10/26/deray-mckesson-why-im-voting-for-hillary-clinton/\">Clinton in the general election</a>. \u201cI was shocked by activists and organisers in 2016 saying that elections didn\u2019t matter. I was shocked by people participating in the logic that said structures didn\u2019t matter, because there\u2019s so much at stake in it. Those same people are now, especially given that Trump is just so wild, building voter organisations.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>There was so much hope with Obama.

Mckesson believes the police have been emboldened but has numerous other concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s legacy.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing about Trump that\u2019s so dangerous is the pace with which he\u2019s making decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo per cent of what this administration is doing is making the news but all of it is bad. So, I think when the dust settles, when he\u2019s out of office, only then will the public actually understand the true extent to which he has done damage. It\u2019s all the things that are not Russia, that are not impeachment, that are not in the news.\u201d</p> <p>After Ferguson, Mckesson, instantly recognisable for his blue vest, became a leading figure in Black Lives Matter. In 2016 he ran for mayor of Baltimore, <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/anne-arundel/bs-md-ci-deray-20160426-story.html\">finishing sixth in the Democratic primary</a>, and was arrested in Baton Rouge, Florida, after police shot dead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/protests-in-baton-rouge-after-louisiana-police-shoot-alton-sterling-dead\">37-year-old Alton Sterling</a>.

It is running a What Matters 2020 campaign to engage communities and encourage voter registration for next year\u2019s elections.</p> <p>Mckesson, however, is on a brief hiatus. \u201cI\u2019ve been taking it slow at the end of the year just because I worked so hard for so long,\u201d he says. \u201cTo have done what was done took a toll on all of us and after watching and being around people and being one of the people who struggled to just make sense of everything and all the sacrifices and all that, I really needed to just step back a little bit. So I\u2019m excited for 2020. I have a lot of plans in 2020 with what we do around the police. I just needed to slow down for a minute.\u201d</p> <p>As a new decade dawns with Trump in the White House, inequality entrenched and police brutality stubbornly resilient, there are plenty of reasons to be ambivalent. At first, Mckesson tried to be positive: \u201cI think in 10, hopefully less than 20 years, we\u2019ll see a dramatic transformation. This is like the dark before the light. A lot of people fight really hard.\u201d</p> <p>But then he added: \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to watch people say things like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re not in the streets like people in other countries.\u2019 The reality is, when there were thousands of us risking our lives in the street, those people weren\u2019t. So if anything, there is a whole set of people who I was in the street with who are less willing to do it again because we saw that it was gonna be a lot of lip service.</p> <p>\u201cWe saw that people were going to say, \u2018Oh, my God, people should be in the street,\u2019 but would never join us. We saw that people weren\u2019t willing to risk much and I think there\u2019s less of a willingness to do it. It\u2019s easy to stand in the street at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning when there are TV crews and you\u2019ve got a podium and it\u2019s a concert. It\u2019s much harder to do when the police are literally ready to kill you at 2am, it\u2019s dark and you\u2019re standing in a side street.\u201d</p> <p>Last year Mckesson published a book, On the Other Side of Freedom: The Case for Hope. As if mocking that title, 897 people have been shot and killed by police so far in 2019, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/police-shootings-2019/\">a count by the Washington Post</a>. \u201cThe police have killed more people since the protest, not less,\u201d Mckesson said. \u201cThat is the sobering reality because it\u2019s also a reminder that we are so much work to do. The civil rights movement was decade-long works of activism, so I\u2019m not discouraged.</p> <p>\u201cIn five years we have completely shifted the conversation about race and justice in the country. People felt like it was an impossible task and we did it without grants and workshops and all the things that people tell you you must have to be able to make to make change. So I\u2019m incredibly proud of that.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s much harder to do when the police are literally ready to kill you at 2am, it\u2019s dark and you\u2019re standing in a side street.\u201d Last year Mckesson published a book, On the Other Side of Freedom: The Case for Hope. As if mocking that title, 897 people have been shot and killed by police so far in 2019, according to a count by the Washington Post. \u201cThe police have killed more people since the protest, not less,\u201d Mckesson said. \u201cThat is the sobering reality because it\u2019s also a reminder that we are so much work to do. The civil rights movement was decade-long works of activism, so I\u2019m not discouraged. \u201cIn five years we have completely shifted the conversation about race and justice in the country. People felt like it was an impossible task and we did it without grants and workshops and all the things that people tell you you must have to be able to make to make change. So I\u2019m incredibly proud of that.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It was the summer of 2017, as New York\u2019s subway trains groaned along on near-100-year-old equipment, throttled by a decades-long lack of funding, when things really came to a head.</p> <p>In June, <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/traffic/34-hurt-in-a-train-derailment-in-manhattan-impacting-service/2154319/\">a train derailed in Harlem</a>, injuring dozens. A month later, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/nyregion/subway-derailment-brooklyn.html\">another derailed in Brooklyn</a>. Elsewhere, footage went viral after a train broke down in the middle of a tunnel on a typically sweltering New York summer day. After almost an hour the temperature inside the carriages soared, causing, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/nyregion/f-train-subway-no-power-panic.html\">according to the New York Times</a>, \u201csome riders to panic and one woman to strip nearly naked\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/dec/16/a-tale-of-two-metros-how-the-london-tube-beat-the-new-york-subway\">A tale of two metros: how the London tube beat the New York subway</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It became known as the summer of hell. Only 65% of subway trains ran on time. Transport groups claimed trains were running slower than in the 1950s.</p> <p>Finally, following the Harlem crash, New York\u2019s state governor acted. Andrew Cuomo, who had been widely criticized for his role in the decline, declared a state of emergency.</p> <p>But without significant investment, there was little cause to believe the system could improve. Two and a half years on, however, New Yorkers are hopeful that a $50bn cash injection can save their subway.</p> <p>New York\u2019s subway system began operation on 27 October 1904. <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/10/28/118948837.html?pageNumber=2\">The New York Times reported</a> that a \u201cgreat throng\u201d gathered at city hall and cheered as Mayor George McClellan declared the subway open. An ebullient McClellan told the crowd: \u201cIf this new underground railroad which we are about to open proves as popular and as successful as I confidently expect it to be, it will be only the first of many more, which must ultimately result in giving us an almost perfect system of inter-borough communication.\u201d</p> <p>In 2019, the New York subway has the largest number of stations of any public transport system in the world. A total of <a href=\"http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/\">472 stations</a> are served by 28 different numbered or lettered trains, whose air-conditioned carriages run 24 hours a day, all year round.</p> <p>It has its drawbacks. The utilitarian system isn\u2019t pretty or particularly comfortable. Trains with hard plastic seats howl deafeningly through cavernous tunnels, screeching their brakes along rodent-infested track beds awash with wastewater and litter.</p> <p>At the time of summer of hell, the subway had the lowest number of on-time trains of any major transit system in the world. With just 65% of weekday trains arriving to schedule, it was an embarrassment for a city that likes to see itself as the world\u2019s best. As local media dived into the statistics of the subway, it showed that service had declined every year for a decade.</p> <p>While New York\u2019s trains sputtered along, metro systems in east Asia <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/world-best-metro-systems/index.html\">were raising the bar</a>. Hong Kong\u2019s MTR is on time <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hong-kong-mtr-success-story/index.html\">99% of the time</a>. The trains on Seoul\u2019s metro system have wifi and televisions.

      "bodyText": "It was the summer of 2017, as New York\u2019s subway trains groaned along on near-100-year-old equipment, throttled by a decades-long lack of funding, when things really came to a head. In June, a train derailed in Harlem, injuring dozens. A month later, another derailed in Brooklyn. Elsewhere, footage went viral after a train broke down in the middle of a tunnel on a typically sweltering New York summer day. After almost an hour the temperature inside the carriages soared, causing, according to the New York Times, \u201csome riders to panic and one woman to strip nearly naked\u201d. It became known as the summer of hell. Only 65% of subway trains ran on time. Transport groups claimed trains were running slower than in the 1950s. Finally, following the Harlem crash, New York\u2019s state governor acted. Andrew Cuomo, who had been widely criticized for his role in the decline, declared a state of emergency. But without significant investment, there was little cause to believe the system could improve. Two and a half years on, however, New Yorkers are hopeful that a $50bn cash injection can save their subway. New York\u2019s subway system began operation on 27 October 1904. The New York Times reported that a \u201cgreat throng\u201d gathered at city hall and cheered as Mayor George McClellan declared the subway open. An ebullient McClellan told the crowd: \u201cIf this new underground railroad which we are about to open proves as popular and as successful as I confidently expect it to be, it will be only the first of many more, which must ultimately result in giving us an almost perfect system of inter-borough communication.\u201d In 2019, the New York subway has the largest number of stations of any public transport system in the world. A total of 472 stations are served by 28 different numbered or lettered trains, whose air-conditioned carriages run 24 hours a day, all year round. It has its drawbacks. The utilitarian system isn\u2019t pretty or particularly comfortable. Trains with hard plastic seats howl deafeningly through cavernous tunnels, screeching their brakes along rodent-infested track beds awash with wastewater and litter. At the time of summer of hell, the subway had the lowest number of on-time trains of any major transit system in the world. With just 65% of weekday trains arriving to schedule, it was an embarrassment for a city that likes to see itself as the world\u2019s best. As local media dived into the statistics of the subway, it showed that service had declined every year for a decade. While New York\u2019s trains sputtered along, metro systems in east Asia were raising the bar. Hong Kong\u2019s MTR is on time 99% of the time. The trains on Seoul\u2019s metro system have wifi and televisions. Between 2018 and 2019, Singapore\u2019s MRT trains travelled an average of a million miles between delays of five minutes or more. \u201cI think some of it you can equate to sort of delayed modernization,\u201d Robert Cervero, a transport expert at the University of California, Berkeley, said of the gulf in quality. He said many of the problems the subway faces in upgrading is that \u2013 like the London Underground \u2013 it was built in a very different era. \u201cIn China and Hong Kong, you can say the same thing in Korea, the rapid economic development happened in the 90s \u2013 in the digital era, during a period of rapid growth of the cyber world, IT, the internet. \u201cSo when they were massively investing in new technologies and their infrastructure, it corresponded to this period of sweeping IT change, so they could invest in the most modern up-to-date systems.\u201d As metro systems in Asia were being lauded, New York\u2019s subway was gaining attention for its grimmer aspects. Pizza rat \u2013 a dark brown rat manfully dragging a piece of pizza down some subway stairs \u2013 became an antihero, while torrential rain turned one station into something approaching a waterslide, nearly sweeping away a would-be traveler in the process. On one subway line a woman was awakened by someone urinating in her face. Rebecca Bailin, political director at the Riders Alliance, a New York advocacy group, said: \u201cIt has really declined over the past five years or so. And the reason is outdated signal technology that causes a lot of delays, and other issues like old train cars that break down. \u201cThe other issue with signal technology is that you can\u2019t run enough trains for the population, so you\u2019ve got incredible overcrowding.\u201d A chink of light came in 2018, when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority hired Andy Byford to run the New York City Transit Authority.

Fast Forward was folded into a larger scheme this year, which included overground trains. It delighted transport advocates when it was released as part of a $51.5bn, five-year infrastructure plan in September this year. Demonstrations by activists \u2013 which included carrying a full-size cardboard cutout of Cuomo around subway platforms \u2013 combined with the admission of defeat that had sparked the state of emergency declaration, had finally prompted action. The plan, if passed, will pump state money into improvements, and also introduce congestion charging, which would help the decades-long problem of underfunding Getting funding for New York City-specific transport has been difficult in a state where some cities are 400 miles from New York. \u201cThe MTA is a state-run agency. And for a lot of legislators there are not incentives to fund the MTA. Some of those are legislators who are not in the MTA region, so they don\u2019t have to care.

On 14 June 1870, the body of Charles Dickens was lowered into Poets\u2019 Corner in Westminster Abbey, watched by perhaps a dozen mourners. His friend, Wilkie Collins, was among them, but there was no place for Dickens\u2019 estranged wife, Catherine. Dickens had wanted to be buried near his home in Kent, with no fuss, but he\u2019d lost control of his own story.

      "bodyText": "Start Poets\u2019 Corner, Westminster Abbey Finish Jerusalem Tavern, Farringdon Distance 4\u00bd miles Time 3 hours (or considerably longer) Let\u2019s start at the end. On 14 June 1870, the body of Charles Dickens was lowered into Poets\u2019 Corner in Westminster Abbey, watched by perhaps a dozen mourners. His friend, Wilkie Collins, was among them, but there was no place for Dickens\u2019 estranged wife, Catherine. Dickens had wanted to be buried near his home in Kent, with no fuss, but he\u2019d lost control of his own story. He was 58 years old \u2013 and the brass lettering on his black tombstone still glows with unquenchable force. Dickens loved to walk, at speed, often through the night. Follow him past the Houses of Parliament (where he made his name writing Sketches by Boz) and down to the foot of Hungerford Bridge and the grey Thames (\u201cstretching away to the great ocean, Death\u201d). This is where the 12-year-old Dickens worked in Warren\u2019s Blacking Factory. You can kindle some Pickwickian cheer in Gordon\u2019s Wine Bar on Villiers Street. It dates from 1890 but is undeniably \u201cDickensian\u201d. The trains (which brought Dickens\u2019 coffin from Kent) clatter overhead in and out of Charing Cross. Parallel Buckingham Street (where Dickens \u2013 and David Copperfield \u2013 once lodged) leads to the Strand. Nothing much survives other than its width and bustle, but the Lyceum Theatre (opened 1834) put on an adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities in 1860. And Dickens lived just behind at 16 Wellington Street (now gone) before moving to number 26, where he kept a bachelor flat and produced his magazine, All Year Round. Walk across Covent Garden and past the grand, grubby Garrick Club, which Dickens loved and loathed. In Dickens\u2019 day, Seven Dials, just to the north, was a raddled slum of \u201cdirty men, filthy women, squalid children \u2026 reeking pipes \u2026 depressed dogs\u201d. Thanking your lucky stars (or the author\u2019s campaigning work), head east along narrow, now-sanitised streets to 58-59 Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields, the house of Dickens\u2019 friend and biographer, John Forster. In Bleak House, this is the home (and murder scene) of the ghastly lawyer, Mr Tulkinghorn. One of Dickens\u2019 own homes lies to the north, best reached via Chancery Lane (\u201cthe one great principle of English law is to make business for itself\u201d) and Gray\u2019s Inn Walks Gardens. Dickens lived at 48 Doughty Street from 1837 to 1839, the period when his fame was at its height. It has been reconstructed as he knew it (sort of): his desk, the dining table set for a feast, and the bedroom where his sister-in-law, Mary, died. Head across Gray\u2019s Inn Road and follow Elm Street and Mount Pleasant (where Smallweed skulked in Bleak House) to cross Rosebery Avenue into Coldbath Square. Then take Crawford Passage into Farringdon Road and the warm embrace of the Betsey Trotwood pub. Betsey was David Copperfield\u2019s aunt \u2013 and the pub, while not of Dickens\u2019 era, feels right. Just to the left is Pear Tree Court, where Oliver Twist watched the Artful Dodger picking pockets. Next, dodge back along Clerkenwell Road to go down Hatton Garden (number 54 was Mr Fang\u2019s magistrates court in Oliver Twist), admiring the jewellers, and into Saffron Hill. The streets are dark, narrow and now gentrified: you wouldn\u2019t think that this was once Fagin\u2019s lair, nor that the One Tun pub was, reportedly, Bill Sikes\u2019 local, The Three Cripples. Cross Farringdon Road again, which was in an uproar of new building in the 1860s (it still is) and finish in the tiny Jerusalem Tavern, opened in 1996 but looking ancient. There\u2019s a log fire, it\u2019s cold outside, so raise a glass and say, \u201cGod bless us, every one!\u201d Peter Fiennes is the author of Footnotes: A Journey Round Britain in the Company of Great Writers (Oneworld, \u00a316.99), available for \u00a314.95 inc UK p&amp;p at the Guardian Bookshop Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "body": "<p>\u2018Good morning. Here is the shipping forecast for midday, 21 June, 2050. Seas will be rough, with violent storms and visibility ranging from poor to very poor for the next 24 hours. The outlook for tomorrow is less fair.\u201d</p> <p>All being well, this could be a weather bulletin released by the Met Office and broadcast by the BBC in the middle of this century. Destructive gales may not sound like good news, but they will be among the least of the world\u2019s problems in the coming era of peak climate turbulence. With social collapse a very real threat in the next 30 years, it will be an achievement in 2050 if there are still institutions to make weather predictions, radio transmitters to share them and seafarers willing to listen to the archaic content.</p> <p>I write this imaginary forecast with an apology to Tim Radford, the former Guardian science editor, who used the same device in 2004 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/sep/11/meteorology.scienceofclimatechange\" title=\"\">to open a remarkably prescient prediction</a> on the likely impacts of global warming on the world in 2020.</p> <p>Journalists generally hate to go on record about the future. We are trained to report on the very recent past, not gaze into crystal balls. On those occasions when we have to venture ahead of the present, most of us play it safe by avoiding dates that could prove us wrong, or quoting others.</p> <p>Radford allowed himself no such safe distance or equivocation in 2004, which we should remember as a horribly happy year for climate deniers. George W Bush was in the White House, the Kyoto protocol had been recently zombified by the US Congress, the world was distracted by the Iraq war and fossil fuel companies and oil tycoons were pumping millions of dollars into misleading ads and dubious research that aimed to sow doubt about science.</p> <p>Radford looked forward to a point when global warming was no longer so easy to ignore. Applying his expert knowledge of the best science available at the time, he predicted 2020 would be the year when the planet started to feel the heat as something real and urgent.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re still waiting for the Earth to start simmering,\u201d he wrote back in that climate-comfortable summer of 2004. \u201cBut by 2020 the bubbles will be appearing.\u201d</p> <p>The heat of the climate movement is certainly less latent. In the past year, the world has seen Greta Thunberg\u2019s solo school strikes morph into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/27/climate-crisis-6-million-people-join-latest-wave-of-worldwide-protests\" title=\"\">global movement of more than six million</a> demonstrators; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">Extinction </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">Rebellion</a> activists have seized bridges and blocked roads in capital cities; the world has heard ever more alarming warnings from UN scientists, David Attenborough and the UN envoy for climate action, Mark Carney; dozens of national parliaments and city councils have declared climate emergencies; and the issue has risen further to the fore in the current UK general election than any before it. With only weeks to go until 2020, the bubbles of climate anxiety are massing near the surface.</p> <p>Radford\u2019s most precise predictions relate to the science. Writing after the <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/case-studies/heatwave\" title=\"\">record-breaking UK heat of 2003</a>, he warned such scorching temperatures would become the norm. \u201cExpect summer 2020 to be every bit as oppressive.\u201d How right he was. Since then, the world has sweltered through the 10 hottest years in history. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/29/met-office-confirms-new-uk-record-temperature-of-387c\" title=\"\">UK registered a new high of 38.7C</a> this July, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/31/uks-10-hottest-years-on-record-have-occurred-since-2002-met-office\" title=\"\">the planet\u2019s warmest month since measurements began</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f753229a58ee9093edf0d4af06a00ecab7a4c5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f753229a58ee9093edf0d4af06a00ecab7a4c5b/0_201_2992_1796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hostile world: tackling forest fires in China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hostile world: tackling forest fires in China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Costfoto/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also correctly anticipated how much more hostile this would make the climate \u2013 with increasingly ferocious storms (for the first time on record, there have been category 5 hurricanes, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/04/climate-crisis-hurricane-dorian-floods-bahamas\" title=\"\">Dorian</a> and Harvey, for four years in a row), intensifying forest fires (consider the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/arctic-wildfires-smoke-cloud\" title=\"\">devastating blazes in Siberia</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/23/amazon-fires-what-is-happening-anything-we-can-do\" title=\"\">and the Amazon</a> this year, or California and Lapland in 2018) and massive bleaching of coral reefs (which is happening with growing frequency across most of the world). All of this has come to pass, as have Radford\u2019s specific predictions of worsening floods in Bangladesh, desperate droughts in <a href=\"https://theglobepost.com/2019/11/15/climate-change-africa-drought/\" title=\"\">southern Africa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/central-sahel-countries-need-immediate-food-aid-un/1649863\" title=\"\">food shortages in the Sahel</a> and the opening up of the northwest passage due to shrinking sea ice (the huge cruise liner, Crystal Serenity, is among the many ships that have sailed through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/bering-strait-northwest-passage-arctic-ice-melts\" title=\"\">Bering Strait</a> in recent years \u2013 a route that was once deemed impossible by even the most intrepid explorers).</p> <p>A couple of his predictions were slightly premature (the snows on Kilimanjaro and Mt Kenya have not yet disappeared, though <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.5327\" title=\"\">a recent study</a> said they will be gone before future generations get a chance to see them), but overall, Radford\u2019s vision of the world in 2020 was remarkably accurate, which is important because it confirms climate science was reliable even in 2004.

By the middle of the 21st century, the globe has changed markedly from the blue marble that humanity first saw in wondrous colour in 1972.

Just over 30cm at this stage \u2013 well short of the 2 metres that could hit in 2100 \u2013 but still enough to swamp unprotected stretches of land from Miami and Guangdong to Lincolnshire and Alexandria. High tides and storm surges periodically blur the boundaries between land and sea, making the roads of megacities resemble the canals of Venice with increasing frequency.</p> <p>On the ground, rising temperatures are changing the world in ways that can no longer be explained only by physics and chemistry.

It is also now clear that positive climate feedbacks are not limited to physics, but stretch to economics, politics and psychology. The Amazon is turning into a savannah because the loss of forest is weakening rainfall, which makes harvests lower, which gives farmers an economic motivation to clear more land to make up for lost production, which means more fires and less rain.</p> <p>On our current course, carbon concentrations in the atmosphere will pass 550 parts per million by midcentury, up from around 400ppm today. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/06/katharine-hayhoe-interview-climate-change-scientist-crisis-hope\" title=\"\">Katharine Hayhoe</a>, an atmospheric scientist and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, explains how this stacks the odds in favour of disaster.</p> <p>\u201cBy 2050, we\u2019d be seeing events that are far more frequent and/or far stronger than we humans have ever experienced before, are occurring both simultaneously and in sequence.\u201d</p> <p>Her greatest concern is that food production and water supply systems could buckle under the strain, with dire humanitarian consequences in areas that are already vulnerable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Generation Greta live with a level of anxiety their grandparents could barely have imagined</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hunger will rise, perhaps calamitously.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Good morning. Here is the shipping forecast for midday, 21 June, 2050. Seas will be rough, with violent storms and visibility ranging from poor to very poor for the next 24 hours. The outlook for tomorrow is less fair.\u201d All being well, this could be a weather bulletin released by the Met Office and broadcast by the BBC in the middle of this century. Destructive gales may not sound like good news, but they will be among the least of the world\u2019s problems in the coming era of peak climate turbulence. With social collapse a very real threat in the next 30 years, it will be an achievement in 2050 if there are still institutions to make weather predictions, radio transmitters to share them and seafarers willing to listen to the archaic content. I write this imaginary forecast with an apology to Tim Radford, the former Guardian science editor, who used the same device in 2004 to open a remarkably prescient prediction on the likely impacts of global warming on the world in 2020. Journalists generally hate to go on record about the future. We are trained to report on the very recent past, not gaze into crystal balls. On those occasions when we have to venture ahead of the present, most of us play it safe by avoiding dates that could prove us wrong, or quoting others. Radford allowed himself no such safe distance or equivocation in 2004, which we should remember as a horribly happy year for climate deniers. George W Bush was in the White House, the Kyoto protocol had been recently zombified by the US Congress, the world was distracted by the Iraq war and fossil fuel companies and oil tycoons were pumping millions of dollars into misleading ads and dubious research that aimed to sow doubt about science. Radford looked forward to a point when global warming was no longer so easy to ignore. Applying his expert knowledge of the best science available at the time, he predicted 2020 would be the year when the planet started to feel the heat as something real and urgent. \u201cWe\u2019re still waiting for the Earth to start simmering,\u201d he wrote back in that climate-comfortable summer of 2004. \u201cBut by 2020 the bubbles will be appearing.\u201d The heat of the climate movement is certainly less latent. In the past year, the world has seen Greta Thunberg\u2019s solo school strikes morph into a global movement of more than six million demonstrators; Extinction Rebellion activists have seized bridges and blocked roads in capital cities; the world has heard ever more alarming warnings from UN scientists, David Attenborough and the UN envoy for climate action, Mark Carney; dozens of national parliaments and city councils have declared climate emergencies; and the issue has risen further to the fore in the current UK general election than any before it. With only weeks to go until 2020, the bubbles of climate anxiety are massing near the surface. Radford\u2019s most precise predictions relate to the science. Writing after the record-breaking UK heat of 2003, he warned such scorching temperatures would become the norm. \u201cExpect summer 2020 to be every bit as oppressive.\u201d How right he was. Since then, the world has sweltered through the 10 hottest years in history. The UK registered a new high of 38.7C this July, which was the planet\u2019s warmest month since measurements began. He also correctly anticipated how much more hostile this would make the climate \u2013 with increasingly ferocious storms (for the first time on record, there have been category 5 hurricanes, such as Dorian and Harvey, for four years in a row), intensifying forest fires (consider the devastating blazes in Siberia and the Amazon this year, or California and Lapland in 2018) and massive bleaching of coral reefs (which is happening with growing frequency across most of the world). All of this has come to pass, as have Radford\u2019s specific predictions of worsening floods in Bangladesh, desperate droughts in southern Africa, food shortages in the Sahel and the opening up of the northwest passage due to shrinking sea ice (the huge cruise liner, Crystal Serenity, is among the many ships that have sailed through the Bering Strait in recent years \u2013 a route that was once deemed impossible by even the most intrepid explorers). A couple of his predictions were slightly premature (the snows on Kilimanjaro and Mt Kenya have not yet disappeared, though a recent study said they will be gone before future generations get a chance to see them), but overall, Radford\u2019s vision of the world in 2020 was remarkably accurate, which is important because it confirms climate science was reliable even in 2004. It is even more precise today, which is good news in terms of anticipating the risks, but deeply alarming when we consider just how nasty scientists expect the climate to become in our lifetime. Unless emissions are slashed over the next decade, a swarm of wicked problems are heading our way. How wicked? Well, following Radford\u2019s example, let us consider what the world will look like in 2050 if humanity continues to burn oil, gas, coal and forests at the current rate.

They live with a level of anxiety their grandparents could have barely imagined. The world in 2050 is more hostile and less fertile, more crowded and less diverse.

Nothing could bring us closer to the revelations of his mind and eye. But if this was a high point, Leonardo was also the subject of the year\u2019s worst show. Five centuries after his death, the National Gallery\u2019s vacuous Leonardo: Experience a Masterpiece offered three rooms of crass CGI mock-ups but only one real painting, marred by shifting projections; at \u00a318 a ticket, an outrageous tax on knowledge. The whereabouts of the world\u2019s most expensive picture, purportedly by Leonardo, was never out of the news. Perhaps it was in Switzerland, or nailed to the bulkhead of a Saudi superyacht; certainly the Salvator Mundi has not been seen in public all year. But it turned up, tellingly, in Jonathan Rugman\u2019s book The Killing in the Consulate, briefly considered by one of his sons as compensation for Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s horrific murder\u2013 ordered, it\u2019s presumed, by the painting\u2019s royal owner. All of which makes the Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan\u2019s latest skit on art collectors \u2013 a banana taped to a wall, titled Comedian and selling fast at $120,000 \u2013 look frankly facile.

As if the two great painter-contemporaries were not enough, the show also includes masterpieces by Zurbar\u00e1n, Hals and Vermeer, and continues into 2020. The proper consideration of artists who just happen to be women continued with terrific surveys of Natalia Goncharova, Dorothea Tanning, Doras Maurer and Maar at Tate Modern, Lee Krasner at the Barbican, and the Finnish painter Helene Schjerfbeck at the Royal Academy \u2013 the latter\u2019s incomparably penetrating self-portraits never before seen in this country. Chantal Joffe, Nan Goldin and Charlotte Salomon all received their dues, along with lifetime retrospectives by the octogenarian painters Paula Rego and Bridget Riley, the latter in Edinburgh and now London, still luminous at the Hayward Gallery. Event art proliferated. Visitors picked their way through the obliterating fog and flickering shadows of Olafur Eliasson\u2019s carnival-cum-exhibition at Tate Modern. Steve McQueen, in conjunction with Artangel, photographed 76,000 year 3 children from primary schools all over London for Tate Britain \u2013 spot your child \u2013 and magnified them on billboards across the city: the faces of the future. The Saatchi Gallery showed the treasures of King Tut, heavily reproduced at the till. There was abundantly more fog and shadow at the Venice Biennale. And you could avail yourself of Cattelan\u2019s golden lavatory at Blenheim Palace, at least until it was nicked. Nobody knows its whereabouts now; rather like the Salvator Mundi. The Turner prize had to perform a political U-turn at Margate, returning its Stagecoach sponsorship (unlike the British Museum, which refused to reject BP funding for its Troy show).

Never before,\u201d Brazil\u2019s former foreign minister said of the tumultuous 12 months that have seen social and political upheaval rattle the region, from Buenos Aires to Bogot\u00e1. The final year of the decade was only 23 days old when the turmoil began with an explosion of dissent on the streets of Venezuela that most observers felt sure would displace its authoritarian leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Mass protests, frantic predictions of Maduro\u2019s imminent downfall, and a botched military uprising followed before Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s campaign to topple Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s heir fizzled and an uneasy calm returned. But elsewhere the action was only just beginning, as a wave of protests and violence swept Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador and Bolivia \u2013 where President Evo Morales was forced from office amid a bloody military crackdown \u2013 leaving some wondering if a Latin American Spring had arrived. In Peru the president dissolved congress; in Argentina Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner staged a dramatic political comeback; and in Colombia hundreds of thousands flooded the streets in opposition to the rightwing president, Iv\u00e1n Duque. Even Chile, supposedly a haven of Latin American stability and affluence, was sucked into the mayhem as a hike in subway fares triggered its worst unrest in decades, leaving a trail of destruction and President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era\u2019s future in doubt. \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d Ivan Briscoe, the International Crisis Group\u2019s Latin America chief, wondered as he considered that country\u2019s unexpected cameo in the chaos. As a new year of uncertainty approached, Briscoe said he sensed \u201can acceleration of time\u201d in the region. \u201cThings which have been building up for years and years \u2013 whether it\u2019s the social stratification of Chile; Evo Morales\u2019s moves towards eternal power in Bolivia; the deeply hostile standoff in Venezuela \u2013 now seem to be breaking the surface in so many different contexts and leading to a situation where we fundamentally don\u2019t know what is going to happen. \u201cI can tell you where I think the fault lines are going to be for next year,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I can\u2019t say exactly what is going to materialize.\u201d Some on Latin America\u2019s left have sought comfort in the confusion. Amorim, 77, painted the upheaval as a popular \u201ccounter-reaction\u201d to the \u201conslaught of neoliberalism\u201d besieging countries from Colombia to Chile. \u201cIt is very difficult to say where we\u2019re going,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one thing is different: eight months ago, the appearance was that everything was going rightwing \u2013 totally rightwing. And now it\u2019s not so clear. So that \u2013 in spite of all the problems \u2013 is some kind of progress. \u201cLatin America is in a moment of turbulence. But [for the left] turbulence is better than a death in the cemetery.\u201d As the year draws to a close, minds are turning to what comes next. In a new report the Economist Intelligence Unit warned of a high risk of \u201cprotest contagion\u201d, noting how Colombia\u2019s protests were inspired by rebellions in neighbouring countries. \u201cThere is a strong chance that 2020 will be another volatile year for Latin America,\u201d the report said, predicting particularly choppy waters in Len\u00edn Moreno\u2019s Ecuador. \u201cIt\u2019s like a powder keg,\u201d Amorim agreed. \u201cAt any moment that [country] could explode again.\u201d Briscoe saw three likely 2020 flash points: Venezuela, as it fell deeper into political and humanitarian ruin; Brazil and Argentina, as a diplomatic spat intensified between their ideologically opposed leaders; and Mexico, where President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador is struggling to control a historic murder crisis claiming almost 100 lives a day. Mass demonstrations rocked Mexico in 2014 after the disappearance of 43 students shocked the nation and Briscoe said a repeat was possible if the killing did not slow. Briscoe also foresaw strife in Bolivia if the ultra-conservative activist Luis Fernando Camacho reached the second-round of fresh presidential elections and faced a candidate from Evo Morales\u2019s leftist Movement Towards Socialism. \u201cI\u2019d say we will be facing a very tricky period \u2026 In Colombia, in Chile, but also Brazil, Mexico and Argentina there is potential for things to go very wrong indeed. \u201cWe are sitting on a minefield of social discontent,\u201d Briscoe added, identifying Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Chile as other potential \u201cdanger spots\u201d. Observers are split on whether Latin America\u2019s biggest economy runs the risk of unrest, with former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva recently urging followers to \u201cfollow Chile\u2019s example\u201d and rebel against the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Some argue Bolsonaro\u2019s shock 2018 election has helped channel anti-establishment rage away from the streets, for now. But Monica de Bolle, a Latin America expert from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Brazil could easily be next. \u201cThe moment right now \u2013 as of this very second \u2013 is not one where people are going to go out in the streets and demonstrate.

Han is Beijing\u2019s favoured candidate while Tsai\u2019s party has been campaigning on the slogan: \u201cResist China, Defend Taiwan\u201d.

A recent study by the V-Dem Institute at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden found that Taiwan was the most exposed to foreign dissemination of false information.</p> <p>False reports include claims Tsai\u2019s doctorate degree was fake or that Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong kicked an elderly man when he visited Taiwan in October and met members of the DPP.</p> <p>\u201cChina has multiple ways of pushing misinformation. We\u2019ve found that content mills are no longer simply producing fake information.

      "bodyText": "Citizen groups in Taiwan are fighting a Russian-style influence and misinformation campaign that is believed to originate across the strait in mainland China with just weeks to go before it votes for its next president, Taiwan goes to the polls on 11 January to decide between two main candidates, incumbent president Tsai Ing-Wen of the Democratic Progressive party (DPP) under whom ties with Beijing have become fraught, and Han Kuo-Yu of the Kuomintang party (KMT), which advocates closer engagement with China. The contest is in large part a referendum on the future of Taiwan\u2019s relationship with Beijing, which sees the self-governed island as a renegade province that one day must return to the fold. Han is Beijing\u2019s favoured candidate while Tsai\u2019s party has been campaigning on the slogan: \u201cResist China, Defend Taiwan\u201d. In a televised debate with her rivals for the job on Sunday, Tsai said China\u2019s \u201cexpanding ambitions\u201d were the biggest threat to its democracy. Citizen groups in Taiwan say the openness of one of the freest societies in Asia is being used against it by groups in China to wage an online disinformation campaign, made more potent by their shared language, Mandarin. A recent study by the V-Dem Institute at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden found that Taiwan was the most exposed to foreign dissemination of false information. False reports include claims Tsai\u2019s doctorate degree was fake or that Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong kicked an elderly man when he visited Taiwan in October and met members of the DPP. \u201cChina has multiple ways of pushing misinformation. We\u2019ve found that content mills are no longer simply producing fake information. More and more, they are manipulating opinions,\u201d said Jarvis Chiu, senior manager for the Institute for Information Industry, which has been assisting government efforts to prevent disinformation. According to Chiu, an army of trolls will leave thousands of comments under a candidate\u2019s post or a news article, shifting the focus of the debate. Fake social media accounts also share pro-Beijing content or inflate the number of likes such content gets. \u201cSubliminal attacks\u201d include repeatedly searching for one candidate\u2019s name to influence search algorithm results. \u201cChina won\u2019t give up this practice. It will only increase and because it is non-military, it won\u2019t get much global attention,\u201d Chiu said. The uncertain status of Taiwan, functionally independent but not internationally recognised, has been an issue in every campaign since direct elections were introduced in the 1990s following decades of martial law under the KMT. This year, the question of how Taiwan should deal with Beijing looms even larger after years of increasingly strident rhetoric from China. On Thursday, China sailed its new aircraft carrier, Shandong, through the Taiwan Strait in a move critics described an effort to intimidate voters. Months of witnessing Beijing\u2019s inflexible response to protesters in Hong Kong have cast even more doubt on the city\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework, once touted as a possible model for Taiwan. \u201cThere\u2019s a sword hanging over everyone all the time,\u201d said Shelley Rigger, a professor of east Asian politics with a focus on Taiwan at Davidson College. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting to know that you\u2019re being threatened and that the entity that is threatening you is getting more and more powerful all the time.\u201d In an attempt to push back against the campaign, citizen watchdog groups are manning social media, debunking rumours and trying to trace questionable content back to its source. Prosecutors have been charging those who spread disinformation. The party in office is trying to pass a law that would prohibit support from foreign \u201cinfiltration sources\u201d to a political party. \u201cTaiwanese people have only just started understanding what is happening.

China\u2019s efforts to influence events in Taiwan stretch a long way back and go beyond online information warfare, to include traditional media, incentives for citizens or businesses who cooperate with China, group trips and donations to temples and other grassroots organisations. Last month when Chinese defector Wang Liqiang detailed ways he had been instructed to interfere in Taiwan\u2019s midterm elections in 2018 as well as the upcoming race, few in Taiwan were surprised. \u201cThe story was not as shocking in Taiwan as it was in other parts of the world,\u201d said Lev Nachman, a PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine, studying social movements and focusing on Taiwan. \u201cIt is not news to Taiwanese people that China has been co-opting local organisations for political influence.\u201d Observers say it is unlikelyefforts to influence voters will affect the outcome of the race, where voters will also choose representatives for the legislature.

On Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average has gone up almost 25% having reached record highs day after day, while the broader S&amp;P500 is up 30% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has grown 40% in value. The FTSE100 in London is close to its record high, as is the Dax30 in Germany. In the Asia Pacific, the Nikkei is up 15% while Australia\u2019s ASX200 is still close to its highest ever point (reached in November). But none of these countries, with the exception of the US, are in particularly good shape. Instead their stock markets are being sustained by ultra-low borrowing costs led by the US Federal Reserve. This latest round of rate cutting has turned many of the assumptions about economics on their head to create a bad-news-is-good-news paradigm for markets. While once the release of poor economic data dented share prices, now it sends them upwards because investors expect more central bank intervention. Traders have learned the lessons of the past 10 years and have grown accustomed to expect central banks to act at the slightest sign of economic distress. Markets had a serious wobble in 2018 after the Fed hiked rates. But a U-turn amid intense pressure from Donald Trump, who blamed the Fed chief, Jerome Powell, for stifling growth, has brought the good times back again.

These two broad approaches complement each other \u2013 both reducing the hazard and increasing the resilience of housing stock. Building standards will be a good starting point, as we have control over the design of bushfire resilient houses, and there is a well-established testing and verification system. There is almost certainly going to be an adjustment to building standards, particularly for Queensland.

The second advantage is that it has an ecological end-state as an objective, often aiming to create an open, park-like vegetation structure that has much less potential for damaging crown fires. The obvious and significant disadvantage is that so much knowledge has been lost, coupled with significant increases in permanent (and very valuable) assets in the landscape. It is critical that we take advantage of the elders who are focused on preserving Indigenous burning regimes and adapt these to fit our modern lifestyles. As a minimum every fire manager should read Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe. The chapters on fire provide a well-researched summary of how Indigenous fire management worked that is accessible to a wide audience. The houses and lives lost hit us hard as fire planners; it is more than just a job for most of us. We are going to honour those people by learning as much as we can from this disaster and continuing to adapt.

Obama first began releasing annual lists of his favourite cultural works in 2015, beginning with books. They were reportedly intended to highlight works from both high profile and lesser known creators. Suggesting a perception that film is generally a more powerful medium than television, Obama also listed three television shows \u201cthat I considered as powerful as movies\u201d: the true-story based MeToo drama Unbelievable, the recent adaptation of Watchmen, and the second season of Fleabag.

More than 2,750 jobs were lost every week, according to a detailed analysis by the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) published today. It predicts the picture will worsen in 2020, unless the government intervenes, with high business rates one of the factors blamed for accelerating chain store closures. Prof Joshua Bamfield, the CRR\u2019s director, said retail was in crisis owing to high costs, low levels of profitability and sales moving online. \u201cThese problems are felt by most businesses operating from physical stores in high streets or shopping malls,\u201d Bamfield said. \u201cThe low growth in consumer spending since 2015 has meant that the growth in online sales has come at the expense of the high street.\u201d The CRR said 38,100 of the jobs lost this year were down to retail chains going bust with Karen Millen and Coast among 2019\u2019s high profile casualties. Another 26,500 roles were shed through company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), a controversial insolvency procedure that has been used by the likes of Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group and Debenhams to shed loss-making stores. Another 78,600 jobs were axed through cost-cutting programmes by large retailers or small shops simply shutting for good.

A sample list of alleged informers shot dead by the Provisional IRA between 1978 and the 1994 ceasefire has emerged from government files released to the Northern Ireland public records office on Monday. Normally the government does not comment in any way on whether individuals were what the IRA termed dismissively as \u201ctouts\u201d. However, in the document, seen by the Press Association, officials went as far as asserting that not all of those whose bodies were found \u2013 often dumped near the Irish border with bullet wounds to the head \u2013 were, in fact, informers. The official record said: \u201cIn a number of cases, persons murdered by the IRA have not been informers. \u201cFurthermore, in other cases alleged informers have had to leave Northern Ireland at a moment\u2019s notice and start a new life elsewhere, knowing that they can never return to their homes without facing the prospect of torture and murder, possibly having to cut off their links with close family members in order to avoid the risk of their new location being revealed.\u201d The official submission handed to the archives states: \u201cThe Provisional IRA themselves have made it clear on a number [of occasions] that where they believe people within the organisation to be agents or informers, they can expect no mercy. \u201cThis usually means torture, followed by a forced confession and murder. The corpse will then be found in a ditch, often many miles from the point of abduction.\u201d The sample list covers many of the most notorious cases from the Troubles involving mainly IRA members killed by their own organisation after they fell under suspicion. It includes: \u2022 Daniel McErlean, 25, from Rasharkin in Co Antrim, who was found dead in June 1978 at the border near the Co Armagh village of Jonesborough. \u2022 Michael Kearney, 20, from Belfast, who was found dead on the Concession Road in Clones, County Monaghan, just south of the border in July 1979. \u2022 Seamus Morgan, 24, from Dungannon in Co Tyrone, who was found dead in the south Armagh village of Forkhill in March 1982. \u2022 Patrick Scott, 27, from Twinbrook in west Belfast, who was found shot dead in that area in April 1982. \u2022 John McAnulty,48, from Warrenpoint in Co Down, who was abducted in the summer of 1989 from a pub in Armagh.

Occasionally \u2013 as is the case with Stan\u2019s eight-part mystery-drama The Gloaming, from creator and writer Vicki Madden \u2013 the visual oomph of the production seems to manifest as a kind of viscous residue, sticking to your psyche the way a sweat patch clings to your armpit. Take a bow, Marden Dean: the show\u2019s gimlet-eyed cinematographer, who also shot Breath, Boys in the Trees and The Infinite Man. The Gloaming is the latest in an emerging trend of Tasmania-based productions that view the island state as a place of terrible beauty, located somewhere south of the mainland and west of hell \u2013 following on from Jennifer Kent\u2019s period piece The Nightingale, Foxtel\u2019s gothic drama Lambs of God, and another series helmed by Madden: the terrific, darkly ravishing 2016 disappearance thriller The Kettering Incident.
