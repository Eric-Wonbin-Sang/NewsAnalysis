In an interview with ABC\u2019s Insiders three days after the release of Labor\u2019s scathing election review, Albanese revealed the opposition was not on track for victory according to its own internal tracking polling despite the collective belief it was poised to win the May election. Albanese also accused Scott Morrison of \u201cattempting to divide the nation\u201d when asked about his claims progressives \u201csneer\u201d at their opponents and environmentalism is pitting city-dwellers against regional Australians. The review, conducted by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson, blamed a combination of factors for the loss including weak strategy with a cluttered policy agenda, poor adaptability in the face of the Liberal leadership change and an unpopular leader in Bill Shorten. Albanese said he had \u201craised concerns\u201d internally before the defeat including in the Whitlam oration in June 2018 \u2013 in which he argued for aspiration and against bashing big business \u2013 and in the final week after visits to key marginal seats Corangamite, Swan and Longman. \u201cYou could tell on the ground, when you listened to what people were saying, they were raising concerns,\u201d he told Insiders. \u201cAnd when you look at our tracking polling, and this I wasn\u2019t aware of, the tracking polling showed that on seven occasions, we were going backwards, and on 11, I think it was, we weren\u2019t getting a swing big enough to win. \u201cSo on a majority of the tracking polling where you go into marginal seats and look at whether you\u2019re actually going to win or not, a majority of them were telling us that we weren\u2019t going to win.\u201d Albanese also said he \u201cwasn\u2019t aware that there wasn\u2019t a campaign committee, but I wasn\u2019t a member of the leadership group making those decisions\u201d. The review found that multiple research methods were not subjected to robust debate that could have resolved inconsistencies among them. The tracking poll used during the contest \u201cwas persistently less optimistic than the published polling, but inaccuracies in the overall research program led Labor to believe it was slightly ahead when it was, in fact, behind\u201d, it said.

Albanese refused to commit to dump the policy, explaining Labor would outline its policies in an \u201corderly and strategic way\u201d before the next election, scheduled for 2022. Asked about how Labor would deal with the issue of coal, Albanese argued Labor will not have to choose between the environment and jobs because \u201cclimate change is an opportunity to create literally hundreds of thousands of jobs, if we get it right\u201d. He cited his first major policy speech, in which argued that metallurgical coal is a necessary component of wind turbines.

When called before Roban, Lebrion produces an email Herville wrote to the prefect (who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/19/spiral-recap-season-seven-episodes-three-and-four-not-tonight-josephine\">you\u2019ll recall</a> stressed the need for sensitive policing of the Chinese garment district), complaining about Wang\u2019s life being put in danger. Against the prefect\u2019s orders, Herville got in touch with Wang to warn him, and likely signed his own death warrant. Surely now the arrests will come.</p> <p>The problem is that the network is currently dormant, and Roban is effectively neutered by his injudicious actions last week. What you would really need is a pair of high-energy, low-inhibition, renegade cops to do whatever it takes to close a case. Step up Laure and Gilou, the Burke and Hare of witness intimidation. In no time at all, they catch up with Solignac, go upside his head and brutally kink shame him for his weakness for trans sex workers. A chastened Solignac meekly does their bidding, publicly denying meeting Roban and putting in a \u20ac500,000 order with Oury Mazouz to get the network chugging along again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c12370126a5aca44052d6ec8e2dfce2457085151\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c12370126a5aca44052d6ec8e2dfce2457085151/0_234_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Calm before the storm ...

Jos\u00e9phine sends him into the restaurant meeting wearing a wire and while the ruse is quickly uncovered, Laure and Gilou make off with the \u20ac500,000 which has the feel of one of those life-changing errors we\u2019ve been seeing so much of recently.</p> <p>After that, Gilou works his magic on Soizic, persuading her to put the block on the bank transfer to smoke out the network\u2019s Mr Big. When the mysterious Mr Chen surfaces soon after, it seems like the magnificent plan has come together.</p> <p>Ripping off a large criminal conspiracy has its downsides, though. Jos\u00e9phine calls in internal affairs and who better than Tintin to run point? He takes the unusual step of including Laure and Gilou in the investigation into them. It\u2019s a move that treads the thin line between genius and dumbass as gingerly as anything I can remember, but the early signs are promising. They level with him over leaning on Solignac and there seems to be a tentative agreement to work together for the greater good.</p> <p>All such covenants are fragile though, particularly with Jos\u00e9phine snapping at internal affairs\u2019 heels and an annoying little thing called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/05/westminster-sleaze-due-process-essential-media\">due process</a> that lesser law enforcement agents insist upon. Oury Mazouz\u2019s abduction only heightens the stakes. After a failed attempt to extract Oury, we finish on Laure and Gilou\u2019s arrest for extortion and GBH. I suppose it\u2019s about time some bad guys were taken off the streets.</p> <h2><strong>Laure</strong></h2> <p>Laure\u2019s taken a hammering this year but when she lost her way, her mind and her child, Gilou was the constant throughout, even when she did everything to push him away. They become lovers again in a tender scene round at her place which reaffirms the redemptive power of love and fortified wine.</p> <h2><strong>Gilou</strong></h2> <p>As for Escoffier, there\u2019s a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu this week. He chats with his old pal Tintin about the cases they\u2019re working, hooks up with Laure again and gets arrested for serious crimes. It\u2019s starting to feel like the old days. All of this means that he will have to permanently friendzone the beautiful Soizic. It\u2019s harsh, but people outside the CID bubble generally don\u2019t fare well long-term. It\u2019s best she learns now.</p> <h2><strong>Jos\u00e9phine</strong></h2> <p>The bond between Jos\u00e9phine and Lola grows stronger this week as they learn of their shared trauma as rape survivors. Testimony of the attack by her mother\u2019s boyfriend may play well in court, but Lola refuses to play ball. Even when faced with the dead teacher\u2019s wife she\u2019s all \u201cje ne regrette rien\u201d - no explanation, no apology. Jos\u00e9phine knows the rape revelation could take years off her sentence, and journeys to Lola\u2019s mother to try and get her to testify on her daughter\u2019s behalf. It\u2019s a Hail Mary pass but this one is personal for Jos\u00e9phine and we all know how persuasive she can be when that\u2019s the case.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6657ac16e274aace9d59ab8078f2c2bca946f044\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6657ac16e274aace9d59ab8078f2c2bca946f044/0_0_1890_2362/800.jpg\" alt=\"In the picture ... if Cann is indicted, the photos of the Juge will be revealed.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the picture ... if Cann is indicted, the photos of the Juge will be revealed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caroline Dubois/BBC/Son et Lumi\u00e8re/Canal+</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Thoughts and observations</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>If Oury Mazouz\u2019s kidnap is down to the block on the bank transfer, that could be another body we can chalk down to Laure and Gilou.

Gilou As for Escoffier, there\u2019s a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu this week. He chats with his old pal Tintin about the cases they\u2019re working, hooks up with Laure again and gets arrested for serious crimes. It\u2019s starting to feel like the old days. All of this means that he will have to permanently friendzone the beautiful Soizic. It\u2019s harsh, but people outside the CID bubble generally don\u2019t fare well long-term. It\u2019s best she learns now. Jos\u00e9phine The bond between Jos\u00e9phine and Lola grows stronger this week as they learn of their shared trauma as rape survivors. Testimony of the attack by her mother\u2019s boyfriend may play well in court, but Lola refuses to play ball. Even when faced with the dead teacher\u2019s wife she\u2019s all \u201cje ne regrette rien\u201d - no explanation, no apology. Jos\u00e9phine knows the rape revelation could take years off her sentence, and journeys to Lola\u2019s mother to try and get her to testify on her daughter\u2019s behalf. It\u2019s a Hail Mary pass but this one is personal for Jos\u00e9phine and we all know how persuasive she can be when that\u2019s the case. Thoughts and observations If Oury Mazouz\u2019s kidnap is down to the block on the bank transfer, that could be another body we can chalk down to Laure and Gilou. How many is that now? \u201cI\u2019m finding it hard to understand Solignac\u2019s change of heart\u201d. Roban knows that Laure and Gilou helped him out with the Solignac affair and is terribly grateful. A night out with those two boozehounds leaves him three sheets to the wind but significantly happier. \u201cIf you can get back on the right track, I think it will be one of my greatest satisfactions\u201d. With Rayan resuming formal education after some brutal life lessons recently dished out, it would indeed be something to see him avoid what looked like an inevitable grisly fate. With Oury\u2019s sister Lydia revealed as David Cann\u2019s wife, we\u2019re seeing a bit more of the network\u2019s connections. After Chen, Cann seems the likeliest Mr Big but with the state now involved, that title may be moot. What was it Lebrion said to Beckriche? \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting into. This goes way beyond us.\u201d As next week\u2019s finale steadily approaches, how will it all end? Have your say below.",

Asked if he is excited that Sunday\u2019s match between Liverpool and Manchester City may feature as many as half a dozen players eligible for the national team, his reply does not serve to further the hype.</p> \n<p>\u201cWell, it used to be double that,\u201d Southgate says with a wry smile. \u201cSo that\u2019s probably a bigger sign of the times, that we won\u2019t have half the players on the field eligible for us. Then we have to pick up the pieces of that game.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the difficulty from our perspective but those that are playing are of good quality and, of course, it\u2019s a huge game for all of them.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/07/england-squad-euro-2020-qualifiers-oxlade-chamberlain-hudson-odoi-gareth-southgate-john-stones\">James Maddison recalled by England and made aware of responsibilities</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Southgate, who is preparing for the final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2019/nov/07/gareth-southgate-says-bulgaria-racism-brought-england-team-closer-together-video\" title=\"\">two Euro 2020</a> qualifiers, is getting tired of the sound of his own voice when it comes to the subject of eligibility. He has been sharing the shocking statistics about the shortage of English players in the top flight for a year now. It was at 33% of the total then, dropped to 30% in the summer and has bounced back slightly this year, but only just and largely because of Chelsea, who are operating under a transfer embargo.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s almost half the league in this last couple of months that we haven\u2019t watched because the reality is they don\u2019t have any English players, or they\u2019re not at the level,\u201d Southgate says. \u201cWe\u2019re a few per cent higher this year, which is a positive step. You can see even by that small shift that we have two or three players we are picking now that we wouldn\u2019t have had a chance to pick last season. I think I\u2019ve said enough about eligibility issues and the numbers, but the reality is still different from that of the last few decades.\u201d</p> \n<p>Which brings us back to the big game. Included in Southgate\u2019s expanded squad of 27 for the matches against Montenegro at Wembley \u2013 the 1,000th England men\u2019s international, which could seal qualification \u2013 then Kosovo away, are John Stones and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Left out are Michael Keane and Dele Alli. The latter pair have been scratching for form and, in Alli\u2019s case, recuperating from injury, too. But that argument can apply equally to the players who have made the cut. One distinction, clearly, is that Stones and Oxlade-Chamberlain play for the Premier League\u2019s two standout sides.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0f24a761-4c9a-435a-b6f1-c59526082608\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HXT5U2uOMXs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That said, Southgate has proved he is not someone in thrall to the big clubs and Tyrone Mings is still a more likely starter against Montenegro than Stones. The manager is also clear about many of the criteria he uses for selection, with form playing a key part. Stones embarrassed himself in England\u2019s Nations League defeat by the Netherlands this summer and Oxlade-Chamberlain has started only two league games for Liverpool this season after recovering from multiple ligament damage. So competing at the top end of the table counts for something.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the ideal scenario you want players that are playing in matches where they\u2019re pushing to win trophies,\u201d he says. \u201cThe extra pressure that comes with those games is what you have to deal with [when you are] with England. When you\u2019re playing for big clubs, there\u2019s a responsibility to perform every week. With lesser clubs, sometimes you can lose and there isn\u2019t a big inquest.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf course there is one within the club and locally but with the big clubs that\u2019s national. The profile is just bigger and it\u2019s closer to what they face with the national team.\u201d</p> \n<p>Southgate is trying to get the right mix of tactics, personnel and mentality. One person who does know what it takes is Southgate\u2019s old mentor and guest at Wembley, Terry Venables. As his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 points out, Venables remains responsible for England\u2019s sole noteworthy European Championship performance, at Euro 96, his excellence another reminder that success is not easy to imitate.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf course we\u2019ve had some great nights in the last few years but [Venables] was a brilliant manager for me. Great tactical knowledge, great man-management, he developed a fantastic spirit with the group. Our record isn\u2019t illustrious but he delivered one of our best European Championship performances. He was brilliant to work with and inspired me in terms of coaching. I saw the level he was at, having managed England and Barcelona, you knew the level of detail he would go to. I thought he was very forward-thinking and a really impressive guy.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "With all the excitement around the big match, please forgive Gareth Southgate for letting some air out of the balloon. Asked if he is excited that Sunday\u2019s match between Liverpool and Manchester City may feature as many as half a dozen players eligible for the national team, his reply does not serve to further the hype. \u201cWell, it used to be double that,\u201d Southgate says with a wry smile. \u201cSo that\u2019s probably a bigger sign of the times, that we won\u2019t have half the players on the field eligible for us. Then we have to pick up the pieces of that game. \u201cThat\u2019s the difficulty from our perspective but those that are playing are of good quality and, of course, it\u2019s a huge game for all of them.\u201d Southgate, who is preparing for the final two Euro 2020 qualifiers, is getting tired of the sound of his own voice when it comes to the subject of eligibility. He has been sharing the shocking statistics about the shortage of English players in the top flight for a year now. It was at 33% of the total then, dropped to 30% in the summer and has bounced back slightly this year, but only just and largely because of Chelsea, who are operating under a transfer embargo. \u201cThere\u2019s almost half the league in this last couple of months that we haven\u2019t watched because the reality is they don\u2019t have any English players, or they\u2019re not at the level,\u201d Southgate says. \u201cWe\u2019re a few per cent higher this year, which is a positive step. You can see even by that small shift that we have two or three players we are picking now that we wouldn\u2019t have had a chance to pick last season. I think I\u2019ve said enough about eligibility issues and the numbers, but the reality is still different from that of the last few decades.\u201d Which brings us back to the big game. Included in Southgate\u2019s expanded squad of 27 for the matches against Montenegro at Wembley \u2013 the 1,000th England men\u2019s international, which could seal qualification \u2013 then Kosovo away, are John Stones and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Left out are Michael Keane and Dele Alli. The latter pair have been scratching for form and, in Alli\u2019s case, recuperating from injury, too. But that argument can apply equally to the players who have made the cut. One distinction, clearly, is that Stones and Oxlade-Chamberlain play for the Premier League\u2019s two standout sides. That said, Southgate has proved he is not someone in thrall to the big clubs and Tyrone Mings is still a more likely starter against Montenegro than Stones. The manager is also clear about many of the criteria he uses for selection, with form playing a key part. Stones embarrassed himself in England\u2019s Nations League defeat by the Netherlands this summer and Oxlade-Chamberlain has started only two league games for Liverpool this season after recovering from multiple ligament damage. So competing at the top end of the table counts for something. \u201cIn the ideal scenario you want players that are playing in matches where they\u2019re pushing to win trophies,\u201d he says. \u201cThe extra pressure that comes with those games is what you have to deal with [when you are] with England. When you\u2019re playing for big clubs, there\u2019s a responsibility to perform every week. With lesser clubs, sometimes you can lose and there isn\u2019t a big inquest. \u201cOf course there is one within the club and locally but with the big clubs that\u2019s national. The profile is just bigger and it\u2019s closer to what they face with the national team.\u201d Southgate is trying to get the right mix of tactics, personnel and mentality. One person who does know what it takes is Southgate\u2019s old mentor and guest at Wembley, Terry Venables. As his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 points out, Venables remains responsible for England\u2019s sole noteworthy European Championship performance, at Euro 96, his excellence another reminder that success is not easy to imitate. \u201cOf course we\u2019ve had some great nights in the last few years but [Venables] was a brilliant manager for me. Great tactical knowledge, great man-management, he developed a fantastic spirit with the group. Our record isn\u2019t illustrious but he delivered one of our best European Championship performances. He was brilliant to work with and inspired me in terms of coaching. I saw the level he was at, having managed England and Barcelona, you knew the level of detail he would go to. I thought he was very forward-thinking and a really impressive guy.\u201d",

The government can\u2019t use us to repress the people,\u201d one officer, who did not want to be identified, told the Observer. \u201cWe, the police, belong to the people. We do not belong to a political party or particular government.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday night crowds cheered dozens of police officers who marched down a main avenue and garrisoned themselves in the city\u2019s central police station. The mood was starkly different from previous nights of clashes as protesters surrounded officers singing: \u201cBrother, police, join the people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are here to protect the police,\u201d one protester, who did not want to give her name, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d The mood was jubilant as tens of thousands of protesters filled the city\u2019s downtown throughout the night singing and setting off fireworks.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to support the police so they feel encouraged to join us,\u201d said 21-year-old student Alexander Jim\u00e9nez.</p> <p>\u201cThanks to this man [Morales], all Bolivia has united,\u201d said Mauricio Arambulu, 29, with a Bolivian flag tied around his shoulders. \u201cLa Paz is the city where tyrants fall.\u201d</p> <p>In rapid succession police units in the official capital, Sucre, and the most populous city, Santa Cruz, a bastion of the opposition, announced that they were joining the uprising launched by police officers in Cochabamba on Friday. Television images showed 18 uniformed police waving Bolivian flags from the rooftop of the special forces police station in Cochabamba to a cheering crowd.</p> <p>Luis Fernando Camacho, a self-styled opposition leader who the government accused of inciting a coup, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LuisFerCamachoV/status/1192963985206849537\">tweeted</a> that he \u201ccried with joy\u201d and thanked the police for \u201csiding with the people\u201d. The leader of the Pro Santa Cruz civic committee has vowed not to leave La Paz until he delivers a pre-written resignation letter and a Bible to Morales.</p> <p>At least three people have died, the latest a 20-year-old student on Wednesday, and more than 300 people have been injured in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/28/bolivian-election-protests-santa-cruz-block-roads-la-paz\">clashes between anti-government protesters and Morales\u2019 supporters</a> since the disputed election on 20 October.</p> <p>In his toughest ever electoral race, Morales claimed victory with just enough votes to avoid a second-round runoff. But an unexplained 24-hour halt in releasing the vote results, which when resumed showed a shift in favour of the incumbent president, has fuelled accusations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/25/bolivia-evo-morales-narrowly-wins-fourth-presidential-term\">fraud</a>.</p> <p>The widespread police mutiny had substantially weakened the Morales government, said Carwil Bjork-James, an anthropology professor specialising in Bolivia at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is now obliged to manage the crisis without the police and attempt to offer a solution that addresses the large share of Bolivians who have no confidence in the election outcome,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cFresh elections under new electoral authorities can begin to satisfy the protesters.\u201d</p> <p>But they may not calm rising calls for Morales \u2013 Bolivia\u2019s president for nearly 14 years \u2013 to step down. The Organization of American States is conducting an audit of the election count and their findings are expected next week. Neither Camacho nor Mesa say they will accept the results because they were not properly consulted about the process.</p> <p>Amid a wave of demonstrations across the region, political analyst Ivan Arias said the Bolivian protests were centred on democratic rights. \u201cWhat the people are asking for is that their vote is respected,\u201d he said. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Police in Bolivia\u2019s main city, La Paz, have declared themselves in mutiny, joining anti-government protests and fellow officers in at least six other cities. The move puts in serious doubt the president Evo Morales\u2019 ability to hang on to power after weeks of unrest over disputed election results. Local news reports on Saturday indicated that groups of police in the cities of Tarija, Oruro and Beni had joined their colleagues in Santa Cruz, Sucre and Cochabamba in rebelling against Morales\u2019 government. Flanked by military top brass, the chief commander of the Bolivian armed forces, Williams Kaliman, said on Saturday that the constitution prohibited them from entering into a confrontation with the people. On Friday the defence minister said no action would be taken against the mutinous police. Morales called for an \u201copen agenda debate to pacify Bolivia\u201d, inviting four political parties to talks in a televised address on Saturday. He reiterated claims that a coup attempt promoted by \u201cviolent groups\u201d and the opposition was trying to oust him from power and called on his supporters to \u201cmobilise to defend Bolivian democracy and the people\u2019s vote\u201d. However, his call for dialogue was promptly rejected by several political parties and his closest rival in last month\u2019s election, Carlos Mesa, who as a candidate would not have been invited to participate. Addressing Morales in a video message, Mesa suggested he should step down. \u201cYour decision is what will define your own fate and the fate of Bolivia. We have nothing to negotiate with you,\u201d he said. In La Paz on Saturday, crowds draped in the red, yellow and green Bolivian flags surrounded the empty Plaza Murillo, or main square, as police deserted barricades and withdrew to a police station just a block from the city\u2019s towering Casa Grande del Pueblo presidential palace and the parliament building. Soon after, police officers with their faces covered announced that they would be joining the mutiny, raising the Bolivian flag in the square and singing the national anthem. Supporters chanted: \u201cPolice, you are not alone.\u201d \u201cWe are with the people. The government can\u2019t use us to repress the people,\u201d one officer, who did not want to be identified, told the Observer. \u201cWe, the police, belong to the people. We do not belong to a political party or particular government.\u201d On Friday night crowds cheered dozens of police officers who marched down a main avenue and garrisoned themselves in the city\u2019s central police station. The mood was starkly different from previous nights of clashes as protesters surrounded officers singing: \u201cBrother, police, join the people.\u201d \u201cWe are here to protect the police,\u201d one protester, who did not want to give her name, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d The mood was jubilant as tens of thousands of protesters filled the city\u2019s downtown throughout the night singing and setting off fireworks. \u201cWe want to support the police so they feel encouraged to join us,\u201d said 21-year-old student Alexander Jim\u00e9nez. \u201cThanks to this man [Morales], all Bolivia has united,\u201d said Mauricio Arambulu, 29, with a Bolivian flag tied around his shoulders. \u201cLa Paz is the city where tyrants fall.\u201d In rapid succession police units in the official capital, Sucre, and the most populous city, Santa Cruz, a bastion of the opposition, announced that they were joining the uprising launched by police officers in Cochabamba on Friday. Television images showed 18 uniformed police waving Bolivian flags from the rooftop of the special forces police station in Cochabamba to a cheering crowd. Luis Fernando Camacho, a self-styled opposition leader who the government accused of inciting a coup, tweeted that he \u201ccried with joy\u201d and thanked the police for \u201csiding with the people\u201d. The leader of the Pro Santa Cruz civic committee has vowed not to leave La Paz until he delivers a pre-written resignation letter and a Bible to Morales. At least three people have died, the latest a 20-year-old student on Wednesday, and more than 300 people have been injured in clashes between anti-government protesters and Morales\u2019 supporters since the disputed election on 20 October. In his toughest ever electoral race, Morales claimed victory with just enough votes to avoid a second-round runoff. But an unexplained 24-hour halt in releasing the vote results, which when resumed showed a shift in favour of the incumbent president, has fuelled accusations of fraud. The widespread police mutiny had substantially weakened the Morales government, said Carwil Bjork-James, an anthropology professor specialising in Bolivia at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. \u201cThe government is now obliged to manage the crisis without the police and attempt to offer a solution that addresses the large share of Bolivians who have no confidence in the election outcome,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cFresh elections under new electoral authorities can begin to satisfy the protesters.\u201d But they may not calm rising calls for Morales \u2013 Bolivia\u2019s president for nearly 14 years \u2013 to step down. The Organization of American States is conducting an audit of the election count and their findings are expected next week. Neither Camacho nor Mesa say they will accept the results because they were not properly consulted about the process. Amid a wave of demonstrations across the region, political analyst Ivan Arias said the Bolivian protests were centred on democratic rights. \u201cWhat the people are asking for is that their vote is respected,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The scandal over Boris Johnson\u2019s friendship with technology entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri was reignited on Saturday after the Observer revealed that the independent police watchdog has delayed its announcement on whether the PM should face an investigation into possible criminal misconduct until after the election. The decision prompted fury from Westminster politicians and London assembly members who said it appeared that a ruling had been \u201csuppressed\u201d in order to protect Johnson from potentially damaging headlines at a crucial stage of the election campaign. In a private meeting held before parliament was dissolved last week, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) officials agreed not to announce whether they were going to investigate \u201cpossible criminality\u201d over allegations about a conflict of interest in Johnson\u2019s dealings while mayor of London with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri until after the election. Sources close to the IOPC investigation said the watchdog was on the verge of announcing its decision on whether it was proceeding with a criminal investigation. The IOPC was tasked by the Greater London Authority with assessing whether criminal charges should be brought because of the then-mayor\u2019s responsibility for London\u2019s policing. It is alleged Arcuri received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Johnson, including receiving large sums of public money for her technology firms. The offence of misconduct in public office carries a maximum term of life imprisonment. Johnson has denied any impropriety. Jon Trickett, shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: \u201cThis is incredible. It\u2019s a suppression of information which the public is entitled to have. Given the fact we\u2019re in a general election there should be maximum transparency.\u201d He added. \u201cThis decision must be reversed immediately.\u201d Caroline Pidgeon, a Lib Dem member of the London assembly\u2019s oversight committee, said the delay raised the possibility of Downing Street contact with the IOPC before its decision. \u201cIt raises questions over how independent the IOPC really is and whether the prime minister\u2019s lawyers have been exerting undue pressure,\u201d she said. The news follows a chaotic week for Johnson, the government and the Conservative party. A cabinet minister, Alun Cairns, was forced to resign, and the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, was heavily criticised for suggesting victims of the Grenfell Tower fire had lacked \u201ccommon sense\u201d for not defying advice of the fire services and fleeing the building. Saturday\u2019s latest Opinium poll for the Observer suggests the Tories\u2019 rocky campaign start could already be doing damage to the party\u2019s election prospects. Its lead over Labour has been cut by four points from 16 to 12 over the past week. When the prime minister was referred to the IOPC on 27 September, government sources described the move as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. Instead of announcing its decision on the investigation last week, the IOPC decided to cite election \u201cpurdah\u201d \u2013 the pre-election period during which restrictions are imposed on policy announcements and use of public resources \u2013 as a reason for deferring the announcement until after the 12 December poll. Critics point out that if the IOPC\u2019s decision had been not to investigate there would be no problem announcing that before purdah began. Trickett said: \u201cThere can be no possible excuse for purdah in this case.\u201d Pidgeon added: \u201cAn independent agency shouldn\u2019t be hiding behind purdah rules that may not even apply to it. This is absolutely in the public interest.\u201d Tom Copley, a Labour member of the assembly oversight committee, which has launched its own inquiry into allegations related to Johnson\u2019s relationship with Arcuri, said: \u201cIf it is true that the IOPC is hiding behind purdah rules, then that would be outrageous. The IOPC must do their job without fear or favour regardless of whether we happen to be having an election.\u201d The IOPC says it places great emphasis on being \u201centirely independent of the government\u201d. Its website adds: \u201cAs a totally independent body, not part of the police or government, we investigate and make decisions on serious and sensitive cases.\u201d When asked, a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said she was \u201cunable to confirm\u201d if purdah rules applied to the IOPC. In the Cabinet Office\u2019s special guidance for the 2019 general election, released last Monday, there is no reference to the IOPC. Similarly, the updated Commons briefing paper on purdah, published last Tuesday, has no reference to the watchdog. Purdah applies to non-departmental public bodies and other arms\u2019 length bodies but the official list of 407 agencies and other public bodies does not name the IOPC. An IOPC spokesman admitted he was \u201cnot entirely sure\u201d whether purdah rules applied to the organisation but because of the case\u2019s significance it may receive Cabinet Office guidance to be \u201con the safe side\u201d although they did not believe that had occurred. \u201cThe assessment is still ongoing as far as I\u2019m aware, nothing is imminent that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said. Despite the postponement of the decision it is understood the investigation is ongoing, although it remains limited to a \u201cscoping exercise\u201d. An IOPC spokesperson said: \u201cThe IOPC strongly refutes claims published in the Observer. This matter has not been finalised. We have not delayed any announcements on the status of this referral. Our assessment of this matter is ongoing as we continue to collect information and seek legal advice.\u201d She said the IOPC had not been \u2018tasked\u2019 by the GLA but that the monitoring officer was required by law to make the referral. The IOPC\u2019s involvement meant that an earlier, separate, misconduct inquiry into Johnson\u2019s relationship with Arcuri had to be paused. On 16 October it asked for a postponement of the London assembly\u2019s inquiry while it was \u201cacquiring material \u2026 to determine whether it is necessary for this matter to be criminally investigated\u201d. It has also emerged that London assembly members were told that the IOPC investigation would be \u201cdone and dusted\u201d by the end of this month. Among the allegations being investigated by the IOPC are questions over a payment of \u00a3126,000 of public money to Arcuri\u2019s businesses and why she was on three overseas trade missions with Johnson, despite not qualifying as a delegate. \u2022 The headline was amended on 11 November 2019 to clarify that the inquiry referred to would be conducted by the police watchdog, the IOPC, not the police.",

      "body": "<h2>Interview of the week</h2> <p>Sky News presenter Kay Burley reacted with fury when, having expected to be grilling Tory chairman James Cleverly, she was left facing an empty chair. A row ensued over the reasons behind the no-show. Yet with the quality of political talent on display over the last week, fellow broadcasters have been asking if the chair is still available for interviews. Certainly an inanimate piece of office furniture would offer better insight than some of the outings this week. First prize must go to minister Nadhim Zahawi, who suggested he didn\u2019t know whether it was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policy to actually shoot the rich. His punishment? Zahawi was sent out to do even more interviews. Poor campaign directors have to get their revenge somehow.</p> <h2>Candidate of the week</h2> <p>A rich tapestry to pick from, with many quitting or being ousted. One hopeful, however, went above and beyond. Step forward Jane Aitchison, Labour candidate for Pudsey, West Yorkshire, who was drawn into an attempt to defend a colleague who said she would celebrate the death of Tony Blair. After several failed attempts to shake off BBC interviewer Emma Barnett, there was a 12-second pause as Aitchison skimmed through a mental Rolodex of stupid answers. Identifying the glorious winner, she said: \u201cPeople do celebrate death sometimes\u2026 for instance, they celebrated the death of Hitler.\u201d Ah yes, that\u2019ll sort it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/09/dominic-grieve-campaign-trail-beaconsfield\">\u2018Completely bizarre\u2019: Grieve campaigns to overturn his Tory majority</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Gaffe of the week</h2> <p>From the claim by Jacob Rees-Mogg that Grenfell victims lacked common sense to the resignation of alleged cabinet minister Alun Cairns, it really would be unfair to pick a winner. As a result, the prize for gaffe of the week goes to the entire political class for efforts that could double as a Monty Python sketch. Former UK national security adviser Mark Lyall Grant captured the mood. When asked about possible Russian interference in the election, the former diplomat observed: \u201cIf I was a Russian spy trying to undermine British democracy, it would be difficult to know quite where you\u2019d put the effort.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/08/shifty-shades-of-may-boris-johnson-dodges-voters-in-week-of-election-hell\">Shifty shades of May: Boris Johnson dodges voters in week of election pain</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Good week</h2> <p>Journalists writing about the absurdity of the election campaign.

      "bodyText": "Interview of the week Sky News presenter Kay Burley reacted with fury when, having expected to be grilling Tory chairman James Cleverly, she was left facing an empty chair. A row ensued over the reasons behind the no-show. Yet with the quality of political talent on display over the last week, fellow broadcasters have been asking if the chair is still available for interviews. Certainly an inanimate piece of office furniture would offer better insight than some of the outings this week. First prize must go to minister Nadhim Zahawi, who suggested he didn\u2019t know whether it was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policy to actually shoot the rich. His punishment? Zahawi was sent out to do even more interviews. Poor campaign directors have to get their revenge somehow. Candidate of the week A rich tapestry to pick from, with many quitting or being ousted. One hopeful, however, went above and beyond. Step forward Jane Aitchison, Labour candidate for Pudsey, West Yorkshire, who was drawn into an attempt to defend a colleague who said she would celebrate the death of Tony Blair. After several failed attempts to shake off BBC interviewer Emma Barnett, there was a 12-second pause as Aitchison skimmed through a mental Rolodex of stupid answers. Identifying the glorious winner, she said: \u201cPeople do celebrate death sometimes\u2026 for instance, they celebrated the death of Hitler.\u201d Ah yes, that\u2019ll sort it. Gaffe of the week From the claim by Jacob Rees-Mogg that Grenfell victims lacked common sense to the resignation of alleged cabinet minister Alun Cairns, it really would be unfair to pick a winner. As a result, the prize for gaffe of the week goes to the entire political class for efforts that could double as a Monty Python sketch. Former UK national security adviser Mark Lyall Grant captured the mood. When asked about possible Russian interference in the election, the former diplomat observed: \u201cIf I was a Russian spy trying to undermine British democracy, it would be difficult to know quite where you\u2019d put the effort.\u201d Good week Journalists writing about the absurdity of the election campaign. We haven\u2019t even mentioned the Brexit party candidate whose band dresses up as undead pilots of the Luftwaffe or the Tory candidate who stood down only to be replaced by his wife. This column thanks them all for the material. Bad week The electorate. It pains me to inform you that at the end of all this, someone does unfortunately have to run the country. Perhaps a minority government unable to actually do anything wasn\u2019t such a bad idea after all.",

But new research suggests the management of breast injuries for athletes in these contact sports needs to catch up, particularly as more women and girls enter the game.</p> <p>When PhD candidate Brooke Brisbine took to the road, visiting over 30 training sessions across Victoria, NSW, the ACT and Queensland, she surprised a lot of the female athletes and staff.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/07/indigenous-women-continue-to-play-key-role-in-development-of-football-in-australia\">Indigenous women continue to play key role in development of football in Australia | Samantha Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was quite nearly the first time that any of these players had ever been asked about a breast injury,\u201d Brisbine says. \u201cAnd certainly the first time a vast majority of them had ever said anything about it at all.\u201d</p> <p>In person and online, working with the University of Wollongong and Australian Institute of Sport, Brisbine surveyed almost 300 athletes and close to 250 coaching and medical staff to investigate the occurrence and perception of breast injuries in women\u2019s AFL, rugby sevens, league and union.</p> <p>Fifty-eight percent of players reported experiencing a contact breast injury during training or a game, and almost half of those, more often sub-elite players, said the injury had affected their performance.</p> <p>However, coaches and medical staff were often unaware of the problem and underestimated the occurrence of breast injuries for their players. In the study, most staff estimated fewer than 5% of players had sustained such an injury.</p> <p>Brisbine says this is not surprising considering so few players are reporting their breast injuries. \u201cNo one\u2019s been asking them about it. No one told them that it\u2019s important to report it,\u201d she says, adding that women playing at the community level represented the bulk of her data.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They\u2019re athletic, but [their bodies] are not exactly the same [as men] so we need to pay attention to the differences</p> <footer> <cite>Deirdre McGhee</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to Brisbine, a lot of female athletes felt they would not be taken seriously if they reported the injury or were unsure if it could be treated. \u201cBreasts are still a bit of a taboo topic, especially in female sports,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a tendency in elite sport to play through the pain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWomen are taking the game as seriously as men,\u201d says<strong> </strong>Deirdre McGhee, research supervisor and co-director of UOW\u2019s Breast Research Australia. \u201cThey\u2019re athletic, but [their bodies] are not exactly the same so we need to pay attention to the differences.\u201d</p> <p>With more and more women and girls participating every year, the research comes at a critical time.

      "bodyText": "The popularity of women\u2019s rugby and Australian rules football has soared in Australia in recent years. But new research suggests the management of breast injuries for athletes in these contact sports needs to catch up, particularly as more women and girls enter the game. When PhD candidate Brooke Brisbine took to the road, visiting over 30 training sessions across Victoria, NSW, the ACT and Queensland, she surprised a lot of the female athletes and staff. \u201cIt was quite nearly the first time that any of these players had ever been asked about a breast injury,\u201d Brisbine says. \u201cAnd certainly the first time a vast majority of them had ever said anything about it at all.\u201d In person and online, working with the University of Wollongong and Australian Institute of Sport, Brisbine surveyed almost 300 athletes and close to 250 coaching and medical staff to investigate the occurrence and perception of breast injuries in women\u2019s AFL, rugby sevens, league and union. Fifty-eight percent of players reported experiencing a contact breast injury during training or a game, and almost half of those, more often sub-elite players, said the injury had affected their performance. However, coaches and medical staff were often unaware of the problem and underestimated the occurrence of breast injuries for their players. In the study, most staff estimated fewer than 5% of players had sustained such an injury. Brisbine says this is not surprising considering so few players are reporting their breast injuries. \u201cNo one\u2019s been asking them about it. No one told them that it\u2019s important to report it,\u201d she says, adding that women playing at the community level represented the bulk of her data. According to Brisbine, a lot of female athletes felt they would not be taken seriously if they reported the injury or were unsure if it could be treated. \u201cBreasts are still a bit of a taboo topic, especially in female sports,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a tendency in elite sport to play through the pain.\u201d \u201cWomen are taking the game as seriously as men,\u201d says Deirdre McGhee, research supervisor and co-director of UOW\u2019s Breast Research Australia. \u201cThey\u2019re athletic, but [their bodies] are not exactly the same so we need to pay attention to the differences.\u201d With more and more women and girls participating every year, the research comes at a critical time. Identifying the problem is the first step towards developing strategies to prevent and treat breast injuries to enable women to perform at their best. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying that this is happening to a lot of women. But we\u2019ve identified a problem that has very poor awareness. Girls are not reporting [their injuries], and therefore we are managing it very poorly,\u201d Dr McGhee says. Already players learn to protect themselves from injury with correct technique but with more research to understand the incidence of breast injuries in each code and how they occur, effective preventative strategies can be developed for each game. Retired rugby league player Joanne Barrett understands the differences in physical contact between the rugby codes, having also played a bit of rugby union in her time. \u201cI\u2019ve been a forward and a back in both codes and it is really different types of contact,\u201d she explains. \u201cIn league, there\u2019s a lot more run up, there\u2019s a lot more one-on-ones, as opposed to union.\u201d Barrett played in eight State of Origins for Queensland , the team she now manages, and represented Australia in two World Cups.

Bruising is certainly a symptom of soft tissue injuries, along with swelling and pain, but as sports physician Sharon Stay explains, after a traumatic breast injury, the fatty fibrous tissue may change. \u201cWe call it fat necrosis.

      "body": "<p>Here are two numbers to bear in mind this election season: 83% and 23%. The first is the combined haul of the Conservatives and Labour in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2017/jun/08/live-uk-election-results-in-full-2017\" title=\"\">2017 general election</a>, the highest since 1970. The second is their combined share in this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019-european-parliamentary-elections\" title=\"\">European parliament elections</a>, the lowest in a nationwide poll since the mass franchise was introduced. In two years, the big two parties went from a once-in-a-generation high to an all-time low. As another election approaches, they are both working to claw these losses back. Downing Street awaits for the party best able to recover its lost support. Welcome to the \u201cbig squeeze\u201d election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/09/dominic-grieve-campaign-trail-beaconsfield\">\u2018Completely bizarre\u2019: Grieve campaigns to overturn his Tory majority</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brexit is the common denominator behind both the surprise resurgence of two-party politics in 2017, and its sudden collapse this year. And Brexit will be the driving force again this winter. The Conservatives under Theresa May rose by squeezing the Ukip vote; now, under Boris Johnson, they are looking to squash support for Ukip\u2019s successor, Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. Labour\u2019s 2017 surge was driven in part by Remain voters who saw the party as best-placed to stop a Tory hard Brexit. Team Corbyn badly needs these Remainers to return to the fold.</p> <p>One novelty in this election is the appearance of high-profile independents and switchers, most of whom are strongly associated with the Remain cause. Former Labour and Tory MPs standing now as Liberal Democrats, such as Luciana Berger or Sam Gyimah, may provide the party with attractive local champions to consolidate Remain support in seats where otherwise it would look out of the running. And pro-Remain independents such as Dominic Grieve may bring otherwise safe Conservative seats into play if they can consolidate Remain support from other parties while also bringing in Tory Remainers unwilling to back opposition parties. The weakening of traditional party loyalties, and the strengthening of Brexit loyalties, may facilitate this process, making it easier for prominent Remain politicians to gather support even if they stand without a traditional party banner.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The Conservatives\u2019 early lead may help persuade wavering Remainers that a Labour vote is their last chance to stop Brexit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These rebels and switchers may give Remainers a new advantage in seats where they stand, but it is the Conservatives who have the early advantage in the national squeeze stakes. Their poll numbers are up more than 10 points since the summer, with most of this increase coming from the Brexit party, whose support has halved over that period. Johnson\u2019s embrace of a hard Brexit \u2013 and his success rallying Eurosceptic MPs and journalists behind his renegotiated deal \u2013 has given him a powerful squeeze argument to put to Brexit party voters, and this has driven his current polling lead. Yet his deal is new and poorly understood, and will now face a barrage of Brexit party criticism as Farage seeks to convince wavering Brexit party voters that Johnson\u2019s deal is not a \u201creal Brexit\u201d.</p> <p>Labour starts from a tougher position. Its ambiguous and evolving Brexit policy is not a great tool for persuading Remain voters, and Jeremy Corbyn is much less liked and trusted among partisan Remainers than Johnson is among Brexiters.

      "bodyText": "Here are two numbers to bear in mind this election season: 83% and 23%. The first is the combined haul of the Conservatives and Labour in the 2017 general election, the highest since 1970. The second is their combined share in this year\u2019s European parliament elections, the lowest in a nationwide poll since the mass franchise was introduced. In two years, the big two parties went from a once-in-a-generation high to an all-time low. As another election approaches, they are both working to claw these losses back. Downing Street awaits for the party best able to recover its lost support. Welcome to the \u201cbig squeeze\u201d election. Brexit is the common denominator behind both the surprise resurgence of two-party politics in 2017, and its sudden collapse this year. And Brexit will be the driving force again this winter. The Conservatives under Theresa May rose by squeezing the Ukip vote; now, under Boris Johnson, they are looking to squash support for Ukip\u2019s successor, Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. Labour\u2019s 2017 surge was driven in part by Remain voters who saw the party as best-placed to stop a Tory hard Brexit. Team Corbyn badly needs these Remainers to return to the fold. One novelty in this election is the appearance of high-profile independents and switchers, most of whom are strongly associated with the Remain cause. Former Labour and Tory MPs standing now as Liberal Democrats, such as Luciana Berger or Sam Gyimah, may provide the party with attractive local champions to consolidate Remain support in seats where otherwise it would look out of the running. And pro-Remain independents such as Dominic Grieve may bring otherwise safe Conservative seats into play if they can consolidate Remain support from other parties while also bringing in Tory Remainers unwilling to back opposition parties. The weakening of traditional party loyalties, and the strengthening of Brexit loyalties, may facilitate this process, making it easier for prominent Remain politicians to gather support even if they stand without a traditional party banner. These rebels and switchers may give Remainers a new advantage in seats where they stand, but it is the Conservatives who have the early advantage in the national squeeze stakes. Their poll numbers are up more than 10 points since the summer, with most of this increase coming from the Brexit party, whose support has halved over that period. Johnson\u2019s embrace of a hard Brexit \u2013 and his success rallying Eurosceptic MPs and journalists behind his renegotiated deal \u2013 has given him a powerful squeeze argument to put to Brexit party voters, and this has driven his current polling lead. Yet his deal is new and poorly understood, and will now face a barrage of Brexit party criticism as Farage seeks to convince wavering Brexit party voters that Johnson\u2019s deal is not a \u201creal Brexit\u201d. Labour starts from a tougher position. Its ambiguous and evolving Brexit policy is not a great tool for persuading Remain voters, and Jeremy Corbyn is much less liked and trusted among partisan Remainers than Johnson is among Brexiters. Labour has made much less headway this autumn in winning back lost support. It does, however, have some cards left to play. Its 2017 surge leaves it as the strongest competitor in most Tory-held seats, making credible its claim to be the only viable alternative to Johnson\u2019s Brexit in most seats. The Conservatives\u2019 early campaign advantage may also be a help if it persuades wavering Remain voters that, whatever their reservations about Corbyn, a Labour vote is their last chance to stop Brexit. The smaller parties can play the squeeze game, too. The SNP is in second place in all Conservative-held Scottish seats, and has been campaigning hard for the votes of Scottish Labour and Lib Dem voters as the best-placed \u201cstop Brexit\u201d party in these seats. The Lib Dems also start second to the Conservatives in many Remain-leaning seats elsewhere, often with a substantial Labour vote available to squeeze.

Tactical alliances can further this goal, and the smaller Remain parties have pursued them with much more gusto in this election than the last, though Labour remains aloof.

Oh Brendan, we never doubted you!</p> <p><strong>Arsenal aren\u2019t in such a chipper mood. </strong>Their form has been hideous. They\u2019ve won just twice in the league since September, against Aston Villa and Bournemouth, and they\u2019ve failed to hang onto leads in each of their last four games, against Crystal Palace, Liverpool, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Vitoria Guimaraes. There\u2019s open revolt within the fanbase, folk not best pleased with Granit Xhaka or Unai Emery. Things are coming to a head. These could be end times. Put it this way: if they lose tonight, you\u2019ll be rubbernecking Arsenal Fan TV, won\u2019t you.</p> <p><strong>And yet Arsenal are still fifth in the table. </strong>They\u2019ve got as good options up front as anyone in the league in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas Pepe. Kieran Tierney is a proper talent at left-back. And David Luiz is always worth the entrance fee, one way or another. Can they put a stop to Brendan\u2019s gallop and enjoy a beautiful day in Mr Rodgers\u2019 neighbourhood? Or will the in-form Jamie Vardy, the division\u2019s leading scorer, push po\u2019 Unai to the brink? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>5.30pm GMT. </p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Paul Wilson\u2019s take on the match, hot off the press. Click, enjoy ... and thanks for reading this MBM. Here\u2019s Unai. \u201cGood evening. Our priority was being consistent ... we created some chances ... I thought in the first half we played well, and had opportunities to score and win the match ... the players worked and had very good attitude ... if we scored the first goal we could control, but we didn\u2019t do, and they did ... our priority is to win the next match at home ... we are behind Leicester and Chelsea, but we must take confidence ... in 38 matches, little by little, we will get better ... we need time, we changed a lot of players ... we are ambitious but we need time.\u201d Is the club behind him? \u201cYes.\u201d And that\u2019s it. Jamie Vardy, this season\u2019s leading Premier League scorer with 11 goals, speaks to Sky. \u201cWe knew it was going to be tough. There were chances for both teams. The boss said it was going to be about patience, keep working it, getting it out wide. And we managed to get two goals. There\u2019s a long way to go. We look forward to the international break and a few days off. Then we\u2019ll come back, ready to go for the next one. We\u2019ve got to take each game as it comes, it\u2019s a long slog. We\u2019ll keep working hard.\u201d Unai Emery trudges off down the tunnel, a desolate and lonely figure. Perhaps he\u2019s off to light up a Strand. It\u2019s another miserable performance from his Arsenal team, who slip to sixth position, leapfrogged by Sheffield United, who drew at Tottenham. Leicester by contrast are cock-a-hoop, full of bounce despite the rain that continues to flatten their hair. They leapfrog Chelsea and Manchester City, moving into second place on goal difference. They\u2019ll end up third tomorrow evening, should the champions Manchester City get at least a point at Anfield, but whatever happens there, they go into the international break in very good nick indeed. The 2015-16 champions go second, after a fully deserved victory over Arsenal! 90 min: Vardy looks to have hurt his wrist, or maybe his shoulder, upon falling. He winces in pain, a blotch on Leicester\u2019s otherwise perfect day. But he insists on playing on, so hopefully it\u2019s not too serious. There\u2019s an international break coming up, so he\u2019ll have time to recover. There will be three minutes of added time. 88 min: Bellerin is booked for a cynical shove on Vardy as Leicester pile forward. \u201cI feel like Arsenal are improving. At least we haven\u2019t thrown away the lead in this match.\u201d Graham Fulcher there, despite all the rain remaining tinder-dry. 86 min: Pepe rather rashly shoves Chilwell in the throat as the pair attempt to iron out their differences over a garden variety free kick in the midfield. The referee shows leniency, telling the pair to stop playing silly buggers, grown men and all. We play on. 84 min: It gets worse for Arsenal and Emery. The home support are giving it the old ol\u00e9s now, as their heroes play keep-ball. 82 min: The home side are utterly dominant now, coming at Arsenal from all angles. A third goal wouldn\u2019t flatter them; they\u2019ve been magnificent in this second half. The Leicester fans chime up a chorus of You\u2019re Getting Sacked In The Morning. Poor Unai. At least I assume it\u2019s the Leicester fans. 80 min: From the third corner, Johnny Evans briefly contemplates an overhead kick, but thinks twice. Shame. Then Unai Emery makes another attacking change: Joe Willock comes on for Lucas Torreira. 79 min: Leicester win a corner out on the right. One leads to another. Then from the second, the ball smacks Guendouzi flush in the coupon, and nearly sails into the top right. He\u2019s very fortunate to see the ball fly millimetres wide. 77 min: Make no mistake, Leicester are in this title race. They\u2019re very easy on the eye. Tielemans tries to make it three with a whack from distance, but it\u2019s always going wide. Meanwhile Arsenal are forced into an attacking roll of the dice, taking off Rob Holding and sending on Nicolas Pepe. What a finish this is! Vardy chases Praet\u2019s right-to-left pass into the Arsenal box. He pulls back for Maddison, who shifts his feet with a super-fast shuffle and immediately fires a low heatseeker into the bottom left! Leno had no chance whatsoever! That was sensational improvisation! 74 min: Luiz has a little nibble at Vardy in the centre circle. A cheeky clip on the ankle. Vardy lets the sting subside and he\u2019s fine to continue, but he\u2019s not happy. 73 min: Leicester make their second change of the evening, and it\u2019s a defensive one, taking off Harvey Barnes and sending on the more defensively minded Dennis Praet. 72 min: Leicester go up the other end and nearly seal the deal, Gray feeding Vardy down the inside-right channel. It\u2019s a perfectly weighted pass, allowing Vardy to run onto it and give it the full belt with extreme prejudice. His fierce shot is well parried by Leno, who keeps Arsenal in this match. 71 min: Arsenal have picked up the pace since conceding. Some space for Bellerin down the right, found by Lacazette. His low ball into the centre is smothered by Schmeichel. 70 min: As things stand, Leicester City are going second, and Arsenal are staying in sixth spot, without a win in five. Great news for Arsenal Fan TV ... and for Jamie Vardy, who is one clear of Tammy Abraham in the Premier League scoring charts, with 11 already this season. This is a lovely goal. Pereira makes ground down the right and finds Barnes, just inside the box. Barnes flicks the ball to Tielemans, who rolls a first-time pass across the face of goal, teeing up Vardy. He slams into the bottom left, giving Leno no chance! 65 min: Ndidi dinks a pass down the inside-right channel that hits Guendouzi on the arm. Leicester want a penalty kick, but we\u2019ve already ascertained that the VAR guy is kipping under the desk. Then Gray has a skedaddle down the right, but can\u2019t find anyone with his cross. 63 min: Nothing comes from the resulting set piece. And hey, while we\u2019re on the subject of tipped cigarettes that cost just three and tuppence for 20, here\u2019s our very own Richard Williams: \u201cWell done for finding the \u2018You\u2019re never alone with a Strand\u2019 ad, Scott. It was, of course, a famously disastrous campaign: instead of making men feel that a packet of Strands would imbue them with the existential allure of, say, Albert Camus or Alain Delon, it sent out the message that if you smoked Strands, you\u2019d be doing so strictly by yourself. There may be an \u00d6zil-related message there, too.\u201d 62 min: Leicester are opened up with great ease, Luiz caressing a long pass down the centre to find Aubameyang all alone on the penalty spot. Perhaps the striker\u2019s cadged a Strand from Ozil. But he\u2019s uncharacteristically slow to react, chesting down and allowing Pereira to toe-poke out for a corner before he can shoot. 60 min: Leicester make the first change of the evening, replacing Ayoze Perez with Demarai Gray. 58 min: That was all a bit wild. Leicester try to establish some control with some patient passing in the middle of the park. They don\u2019t go anywhere, but that\u2019s not really the point. 56 min: Evans is booked for an earlier slide on Ozil. He can have no complaints. 55 min: Aubameyang has the ball in Leicester\u2019s net, but the flag goes up for offside. Ozil is sent scampering down the left. He whips low for the striker, who sidefoots powerfully into the bottom right. But no goal, and that\u2019s the correct decision; Aubameyang was clearly ahead of the last man. 53 min: Barnes skedaddles down the left and tees up Tielemans, who can\u2019t get a shot away from the edge of the box. Maddison tries to flick Perez clear on the right, but Holding isn\u2019t giving him room. Maddison falls and wants a free kick. He\u2019s not getting it, rightly so, and Arsenal go up the other end, Bellerin nearly finding the top right with a rising heatseeker from 25 yards. It\u2019s fun, this. 51 min: Arsenal haven\u2019t done much since the restart. Luiz takes matters into his own hands, barging down the middle of the park and attempting a curler towards the bottom left. It\u2019s always sailing wide of the post, but that was entertainingly rambunctious. 49 min: Barnes dances down the left into space, a fine run. But his cross is too strong. Perez recycles possession, and Pereira is sent skittering down the right. He reaches the byline and pulls one back for Ndidi, who has to score, on the penalty spot. He leans back and sidefoots towards the top left ... but the ball twangs off the crossbar and away! That\u2019s a poor miss. Leicester should be leading. 47 min: A garden variety free kick in the midfield as Ozil tugs at Maddison\u2019s shoulder. A useful counterpoint to Guendouzi\u2019s earlier yank on Soyuncu, and the VAR dude\u2019s reluctance to award a penalty. 46 min: Leicester are almost immediately on the attack, stripping a snoozing Guendouzi of the ball. Perez dribbles at speed down the right and very nearly feeds Vardy down the inside-right channel. Not quite. Two sets of freshly laundered players return to the pitch ... and Arsenal get the ball rolling for the second half. No changes. Half-time advertisement. Stephen Carr suggests that \u201cMesut \u00d6zil\u2019s heat map resembles a lonely sheep farmer roaming the moors at midnight smoking a cigarette.\u201d Yes, that pretty much nails it. A performance of verve and energy not wholly dissimilar to this: The whistle goes. Everyone looks happy enough, given the driving rain. Warm towels! Fresh kit! 45 min: A very strange header by Barnes, who attempts to flick Chilwell\u2019s left-wing cross towards the top right ... only for the ball to slap him on the side of his face as he\u2019s making the movement. The mistimed header costs Leicester the half-time lead, because that was a golden chance, six yards out. 44 min: Lacazette falls onto the ball and shields it. Ndidi tries to kick it away from under him, but accidentally toe-punts the striker on the nip. Ooyah, ow, oof. That\u2019ll sting. The ref takes no action, and Lacazette springs back up quickly enough. 42 min: Maddison whips one towards the top left. Leno is nowhere near it, so he\u2019s fortunate to see the ball ripple the side netting, missing the corner by inches. 40 min: Maddison nearly springs Barnes into the box down the inside-left channel. Barnes is forced to check back. Another go for Maddison, who is quickly upended by Torreira, who slides in hysterically across the greasy turf. He\u2019s fortunate not to go in the book. A free kick in a dangerous position, though, just to the left of the D. 38 min: Bellerin scoops a ball into the Leicester box, forcing a back-pedalling Schmeichel to tip over the bar. Nothing comes of the resulting corner. Not entirely sure how this is still goalless. It can\u2019t stay this way for long. Surely. 37 min: Barnes and Chilwell combine down the left. Chilwell crosses. Chambers slides in to deflect out for a corner with the box brimming with team-mates. From the set piece, Maddison and Tielemans try to replicate the famous Beckham-Scholes combo against Bradford City back in the day. Full marks for ambition, but Tielemans snatches at the volley and it flies well wide. 35 min: Arsenal triangulate down the left. Suddenly Aubameyang sprays the ball wide right for Lacazette, who cushions a first-time pass towards Bellerin, racing into the box down the middle. It\u2019s overhit slightly, and Bellerin can\u2019t latch onto it. Shame, because that would have been a picture-book goal. 33 min: Tielemans has a dig from 30 yards. It flies 30 yards over the bar. So the next time he has the ball, and thinks about shooting, he opts to slide Perez away down the right instead. Perez whips a low ball across the face of goal. Vardy is an inch away from bundling it into the net at the far post. 31 min: It\u2019s end to end, and it\u2019s fast. Both teams are on the front foot. 29 min: But then Leicester spring into life, Perez sent into acres down the right by Pereira. His low fizzing cross only just evades Vardy. Then Perez goes over Kolasinac\u2019s leg just inside the box, but the referee isn\u2019t interested; there really wasn\u2019t much contact. 28 min: Leicester stroke it around the middle of the park for a while, just because they can. Arsenal seem quite happy to sit back and let them get on with it. 26 min: Arsenal ping the ball around the back awhile. Then Bellerin plays a dreadful pass infield from the Arsenal right. It\u2019s straight to Perez, who makes for the Arsenal box and blazes over. Then another phase, and this time it\u2019s Barnes having a shot from the same flank. Leno claims. 25 min: A bit of a lull. The rain continues to pelt down. 23 min: Holding tries to dribble past three men in the midfield. There\u2019s ambition, and then there\u2019s that. He\u2019s stripped of possession and Vardy is able to whizz off down the right. Vardy crosses low, but the ball\u2019s just behind the in-rushing Barnes. Tielemans cues up a shot, just inside the box on the left, but it\u2019s blocked. Holding got away with one there. 21 min: Leno\u2019s penchant for erratic footwork resurfaces. He turns on a simple backpass by Holding, and nearly kicks the ball into his own net. He does very well to scamper after it and hook clear before disaster occurs. But that betrayed Arsenal\u2019s collective lack of confidence. 20 min: Arsenal might not convince at the back, but they\u2019re looking much better up the other end. Aubameyang busies himself down the right and crosses for Lacazette, who sends a dribbler into the arms of Schmeichel. This match certainly doesn\u2019t feel like a goalless draw in the making. 19 min: Tielemans is beginning to pull some strings. He very nearly releases Pereira down the right, but Kolasinac does extremely well to stay shoulder to shoulder and usher the Leicester full back out of play. Goal kick. 17 min: A quick Tielemans throw down the right wing releases Perez. He reaches the byline and cuts back for Vardy, but Chambers is on hand to whack clear. Arsenal look extremely open at the back, like that\u2019s breaking news. 15 min: Arsenal wanted a penalty themselves there, but the ball hit Ndidi\u2019s arm accidentally, and there clearly wasn\u2019t enough for the VAR man to call foul. Or perhaps the VAR bloke has fallen asleep, or his set-top box has fused. Who knows what goes on these days. 14 min: Arsenal should be ahead. A lovely sweeping move upfield is started by Ozil out on the left. He switches play to Bellerin on the right. Bellerin reaches the byline and cuts back for Aubameyang, who can\u2019t get a shot away, the ball clanking into a prone Ndidi and breaking to Lacazette, who tries to chip into the unguarded right-hand side of the goal, but hoicks it wide. 12 min: VAR, though. What a crock. 10 min: Maddison whips the free kick in from the left of the D. The ball flies out of play to the right of the goal. But Guendouzi has tugged at Soyuncu\u2019s shoulder. That should be a VAR-assisted penalty ... but whoever\u2019s in charge of this ludicrous system decides there\u2019s not enough there for a spot kick. You\u2019ve certainly seen those given. 9 min: A rare misplaced pass by Tielemans, who should send Vardy clear down the middle, but overcooks it. Leicester really look in the mood. Maddison comes back at Arsenal down the left. Torreira bowls him over. Free kick. 8 min: Leicester pass it long. Leno is forced to come out of his box to head clear with Vardy threatening to latch onto the ball. There\u2019s a second phase of attack, and Vardy earns a corner that\u2019s wasted. There\u2019s a nice open feel to this match. 6 min: Aubameyang makes ground down the right and cuts one back for Ozil, who dummies and leaves the ball for Lacazette. The French striker can\u2019t get a clean shot away, the ball scuffed into the side netting. But that was a cute interchange. 5 min: Tielemans swings one in from the right wing. Maddison twists in mid air but can\u2019t get much purchase on his sidefoot. 4 min: Chilwell has a couple of sniffs down the left wing. He\u2019s forced to turn tail both times, but his attacking intentions are clear already. 2 min: An early statement of intent by Leicester, who look lively. Arsenal haven\u2019t had much of a touch yet. A moving rendition of the Last Post by a lone bugler ... and then the eruption of a cheer as Leicester kick off. Evans launches it long, in the hope of releasing Perez down the right. Too long. Leno gathers. But the Foxes are quickly coming back at the Gunners, Vardy tearing off down the left and just failing to keep the ball in play with his cutback. The teams are out. It\u2019s tipping down at the King Power, but the fans are making the best of it. The pre-match anticipation is palpable. Zach Neeley is the exception that proves that rule: \u201cDoes Emery think if you just have the highest number of defensive midfielders your defence will be good? Why am I doing this to myself?\u201d Brendan Rodgers talks! \u201cThere is no easy game in the Premier League, no matter what form teams are in. We have big respect for Arsenal and the quality they have. Their players at the top end of the field can score and create goals. So we\u2019re going to have to be what we\u2019ve been for most of the season: concentrated. We have to defend well as a team and show our qualities when we have the ball, and play with speed and with the combinations that we have been. We\u2019re under no illusions, it\u2019ll be a tough game for us.\u201d Unai Emery adds: \u201cGood afternoon. We want to use our players and impose our idea and quality. This match is very important for us. We need to show confidence.\u201d The 3pm kick-offs are done and dusted. Sheffield United are up into fifth place after their 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur; Arsenal have been nudged down to sixth. But the Gunners can reclaim fifth spot if they avoid defeat here. Leicester meanwhile can leapfrog Chelsea and Manchester City to move into second spot with a win. It\u2019s Remembrance Sunday tomorrow. The poppy will grace Leicester\u2019s famous blue shirt ... ... and is also rendered on the retro yellow change strip Arsenal will be sporting today. If It Ain\u2019t Broke dept. Upwardly mobile Leicester, who have won four on the bounce, are unchanged. They name the same XI that won 2-0 at Crystal Palace last Sunday. By comparison, unsettled Arsenal, without a win in four, make three changes to the team held at home by Wolves last Saturday. Hector Bellerin, Sead Kolasinac and Rob Holding replace Kieran Tierney, Sokratis Papastathopolous and Dani Ceballos. It\u2019s Bellerin\u2019s first Premier League start since January, having suffered a serious knee injury against Chelsea at the start of the year. And Mesut Ozil keeps his place, which is always news these days. Leicester City: Schmeichel, Ricardo Pereira, Evans, Soyuncu, Chilwell, Ndidi, Perez, Tielemans, Maddison, Barnes, Vardy. Subs: Justin, Morgan, Gray, Albrighton, Ward, Choudhury, Praet. Arsenal: Leno, Bellerin, Holding, Luiz, Kolasinac, Torreira, Chambers, Guendouzi, Ozil, Lacazette, Aubameyang. Subs: Tierney, Papastathopoulos, Pepe, Martinez, Willock, Martinelli, Saka. Referee: Chris Kavanagh (Lancashire). Leicester City are in a good place right now. To be exact, third in the Premier League table and in the quarter-finals of the League Cup. They\u2019ve won eight of their last ten matches in all competitions, the only bumps in the road having been narrow defeats at Old Trafford and Anfield. They\u2019ve spanked Newcastle by five and Southampton by nine - nine! - all the while playing some glorious football. Oh Brendan, we never doubted you! Arsenal aren\u2019t in such a chipper mood. Their form has been hideous. They\u2019ve won just twice in the league since September, against Aston Villa and Bournemouth, and they\u2019ve failed to hang onto leads in each of their last four games, against Crystal Palace, Liverpool, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Vitoria Guimaraes. There\u2019s open revolt within the fanbase, folk not best pleased with Granit Xhaka or Unai Emery. Things are coming to a head. These could be end times. Put it this way: if they lose tonight, you\u2019ll be rubbernecking Arsenal Fan TV, won\u2019t you. And yet Arsenal are still fifth in the table. They\u2019ve got as good options up front as anyone in the league in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas Pepe. Kieran Tierney is a proper talent at left-back. And David Luiz is always worth the entrance fee, one way or another. Can they put a stop to Brendan\u2019s gallop and enjoy a beautiful day in Mr Rodgers\u2019 neighbourhood? Or will the in-form Jamie Vardy, the division\u2019s leading scorer, push po\u2019 Unai to the brink? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm GMT.",

      "bodyText": "In a blow to Amazon, the socialist candidate Kshama Sawant appeared on Saturday to have beaten the business-backed Egan Orion for a seat on Seattle city council, despite an unprecedented financial effort from the tech giant. Amazon is headquartered in the city. It ploughed $1.5m into the city council election through a political action committee sponsored by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. Civic Alliance For A Sound Economy dispensed about $440,000 in support of Orion and backed six other candidates considered business-friendly. In 2015, according to the New York Times, Amazon and its employees only contributed about $130,000 to city council candidates. Sawant, a member of the Socialist Alternative party and a former tech worker, was elected six years ago as the first socialist on the Seattle council in almost 100 years. On election night she trailed Orion by 8%. But as more ballots were counted she closed the gap, and by Friday evening, with the vast majority of ballots counted, she was up by almost 4%, or about 1,500 votes. \u201cWe were up against a Goliath, there is no question about that,\u201d Sawant told the Guardian. \u201cWhen the billionaires have all the money, the power, the political clout on their side, it\u2019s quite an adversary to go up against.\u201d King County Elections, which facilitates the ballot counting, said on Friday night there were about 2,500 votes left to count across all Seattle. Given that there are seven districts with council races, that meant there were probably fewer than 1,000 ballots left to count in Sawant and Orion\u2019s race. Washington state runs a vote-by-mail system, which means it can take days to achieve a final count. In the past, more late voters have favoured the far left. Sawant thanked more than 1,000 volunteers who she said knocked on more than 200,000 doors. She also said she believed the funding and support her opponent received from Amazon and other corporations could have backfired. \u201cAll of this clarified to people that big business is not on our side,\u201d she said. \u201cThis mythology that, \u2018Oh if only we behaved nicely and we brought big business to the table, things would work out.\u2019 Well that\u2019s been blown to smithereens. They are not on our side and in fact they will use every dollar that they can to try and crush the movement.\u201d Orion, an LGBTQ community leader and advocate for small businesses who considers himself a progressive liberal, has said he considered the funding from Amazon unnecessary and largely a distraction. Four other candidates endorsed by the Civic Alliance For A Sound Economy also seemed set to lose. Phil Tavel, Heidi Wills, Mark Solomon and Jim Pugel trailed their opponents by at least 6%, with Solomon down by about 20%. Two candidates endorsed by the Pac, Alex Pedersen and Debora Juarez, had substantial leads. A win for Sawant would give her a third term. She has been a fierce critic of the influence of big business on Seattle, and helped lead the push last year for the head tax, a per-employee tax on large corporations that was repealed a month after passing unanimously. On Saturday, Sawant said she planned to continue her battle for a tax on big business. Orion does not support the head tax.",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining me for England\u2019s latest defeat. Here is Suzanne Wrack\u2019s report. Germany were just more efficient in the end, they were not mind blowing but looked more clinical going forward. A momentous occasion for England is followed by five minutes of analysis and then Dad\u2019s Army. Nobbs failed to get in the game, which is a shame as she continues to come back from injury. C Noyes says: \u201cWould relish an England-US gold medal match, in part because we would win: for whatever reason, Neville\u2019s England team can\u2019t put 90 minutes together. Their fitness also looks questionable - Germany were well on top over the last 15. England continue to look highly suspect at the back. Would fancy Press, Heath, Lavelle running at that back line. \u201cIn sum: There is only really one team in the world at the moment, and it\u2019s ours.\u201d Neville seems to be missing the point that nothing seems to be improving ... Neville: \u201cIt was a killer blow late on. I think we competed really well. Late on we did not use our experience in terms of keeping the ball and game management. \u201cThe players are devastated as they wanted to get a good result. \u201cThe results aren\u2019t good enough but I\u2019ve got to say there\u2019s a long term and results make people believe our long-term plan. \u201cMoments are costing us.\u201d On his future being questioned: \u201cI don\u2019t listen to those types of people who say those types of things.\u201d Positives for England: White looked good in front of goal and Walsh needs to be a regular in this team. It was a fine occasion with so many people inside Wembley but Phil Neville has more questions than answers. Parris missed her third successive England penalty, Earps did not prove herself as a potential No 1 and Williamson showed plenty of inexperience. Another England friendly under Phil Neville where the only thing we have learned is that his side can\u2019t put a decent 90 minutes together. He can state he is trying to test different tactical theories but that cannot explain why they are so sloppy and slow for the majority of a match. 90+2 mins: An underwhelming finish for the England fans at Wembley who have witnessed another average performance. The final third of the match have been very little to write home about from an England perspective. England have been terrible in the last few minutes; they have failed to close down all shots and crosses and it really is amateur. Marozsan takes advantage to lay the ball into Buhl who is guided into the box by Houghton who fails to close her down and then Buhl whacks the ball into the corner across Earps. 89 mins: Buhl picks up a half-cleared cross, cuts back inside and strikes a lot shot but Houghton blocks to stop it flying in. 87 mins: England have played well for about a third of this game, which is becoming far too regular a trait for the national team. How do you get a team to reach their optimum for the full 90? 85 mins: Taylor powers her way through the Germany defence and then plays it through for Bronze to chase but the defence just about get it clear. 83 mins: Phil makes the valuable point: \u201cCould they not have dragged in 9 random individuals off the street to make the attendance a nice, round 77, 777 ?? I guess not, there are laws against that sort of thing.\u201d I was very excited when the announcement got to the third seven and was then let down. 81 mins: The latest poor challenge from a Germany players sees Leupolz foul Scott about five seconds after the ball had gone. Daly tries to balance things out with a late one on Magull. It\u2019s all quite scrappy out there. 79 mins: Williamson gets done easily on the edge of the box, she looks like she has nothing left to give and should be the next person to be withdrawn. Neville looks soaked on the touchline. 77 mins: Stanway is also on now, taking the place of Nobbs. England have a very attacking lineup out there now. 75 mins: The tempo of this game has dropped dramatically in the last few minutes. It is probably related to the number of subs and everyone else being very tired. 73 mins: Greenwood takes about a minute to take a throw-in and is then penalised for a foul throw. That will not be a highlight of her international career. A triple change for England, as Daly, Hemp and Taylor come on. A bold move to swap the front three. 71 mins: A Germany corner hits an attacker on the back and loops into Earps\u2019 arms. Dabritz is replaced by Leupolz, who takes the armband just after the assistant referee tries to drop the numbers board on her foot. 69 mins: Nobbs is face down on the turf after catching her ankle in the turf. Not what you want to see when she\u2019s just come back from an ACL injury. 67 mins: Scott earns a free-kick on the edge of the box on the right-hand side. Greenwood decides to shoot from the set-piece but her shot goes a long way over. The biggest roar of the game comes after the attendance is announced as 77, 768, the highest ever for a women\u2019s game in England. 65 mins: Germany make a double change with Knack and Bremer coming on. England are starting to look very tired out there, so surely Neville will start swapping things around. 63 mins: Disallowed goal! Buhl spins on the edge of the box and whacks a low shot towards goal which Earps can only parry, allowing Magull to slide the rebound into the corner but the flag is up as she is well offside and the goal is ruled out. We\u2019re beyond the hour mark here, so surely the subs will be coming soon. 61 mins: Greenwood swings in another corner but it\u2019s overhit and cleared for a throw-in. 59 mins: There seems to be a growing level of bitterness between the two sets of players with a few fouls and general shouting at each other, not aided by some poor tackles by Germany. 57 mins: I have some terrible news: there is a Mexican wave going round the stadium. Stop it! White gets the wrong side of Doorsoun and tries to take the ball into the area, she then goes down under pressure from the defender on the edge of the box but the referee is having none of it. Doorsoun then shouts at White on the ground claiming she dived. They was a coming together but nothing else. 55 mins: There was a bit of a delay due to Parris\u2019 injury. I don\u2019t see much point in trying to make her carry on in these circumstances but she is back on the pitch for some reason or other. 53 mins: Kleinherne is the latest to go into the book. The full-back whacked the back of Parris\u2019 Achilles inadvertently and the England winger is lying on the turf in agony. It seemed pretty trivial but Parris let out a horrible cry when caught. 51 mins: The ball is played into the channel for White, who takes it on and hits a cross along the six-yard line but Mead had given up on getting into the box. If she had carried on her run, she would have had a great chance to tap it in. 49 mins: Both teams have been relatively sloppy in the opening stages here, passes going astray and the odd foul. 47 mins: A pretty mundane start to the second half. Here is C Noyes again: \u201cEngland don\u2019t need to be playing well to beat you because they conjure goals out of nothing against the run of play. That\u2019s why they are so dangerous. Compare with France, a team that needs to outplay you to beat you, and which seems to assume that outplaying you automatically means they win. Our US team can deal with that all day. But we struggle to contain this England team because disrupting the rhythm of their play doesn\u2019t prevent them scoring on you. The Lionesses are the team we fear at the moment.\u201d Here we go again! Phil Neville: \u201cFor 22 minutes I thought the occasion was too much. Then after 22 minutes we started to play like an England team. \u201cThe goal was perfect. Germany showed in the first 20 minutes why they\u2019re such a good team.\u201d England\u2019s performance against Brazil so very similar to this, except it took them until the second-half to get into the match. I wonder why they start so slowly. Neville needs to sort that out. Oh ... so that\u2019s what Strictly Come Dancing is. I won\u2019t be turning over, sadly, Alex. C Noyes makes a couple of points: \u201cAs an American that combination of Walsh-White scares me. Stop it already, Lionesses. We like our trophies. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a worse foul that Doorsoun\u2019s: Millie Bright on Alex Morgan, 84\u2019 minute of the WC semifinal.\u201d Some slightly one-eye views there. Kelly Smith is very angry that Ellen White refuses to take penalties as she does not like to do so. Smith seems genuinely annoyed that someone is turning down easy goals. Doorsoun\u2019s foul is shown once again and it really is heinous. She hit her right on the knee cap. You will not see a worse challenge this weekend (I hope). I am not sure I did White\u2019s finish justice. I did say before the game that Walsh is key due to her passing abilities and she proved it with that beguiling pass over the top. England were pretty woeful for the opening 30 minutes but they have been on top since and could be ahead if it wasn\u2019t for the failed penalty. Walsh lifts a superb, curling pass into the box from a central position, which White runs onto and diverts the ball beyond the goalkeeper with a fantastic first-time finish. The Germans want the flag to go up but the assistant ignores them. 42 mins: The problem with the early attempts to play out from the back is that it was all too slow. Now England have upped the tempo and are looking to pass the ball around with speed at both ends, they are putting pressure on Germany. 40 mins: Greenwood whips in a corner from the right but Germany win the header. Mead switches flanks to the right and directs a pass into Parris but her first touch is poor and the goalkeeper slides out to collect. White is told off by the referee for trying to stop Frohms from clearing. 38 mins: Popp has tried to shoot from the halfway but her effort is embarrassingly weak and it trickles towards the box for Earps to collect. An odd decision from Popp. 36 mins: White does well to slip the ball through for Mead, who just beats the goalkeeper to the ball and is brought down by Frohms. Parris steps up, whacks it straight down and it is saved by Frohms\u2019 feet. That is three she\u2019s missed on the trot. 35 mins: Germany\u2019s goalkeeper and two centre-backs pass the ball in a triangle for a while until England decide to put any pressure on. PENALTY TO ENGLAND! 33 mins: England are matching Germany finally and look dangerous going forward, something they could not claim in the opening 20 minutes. 31 mins: Mead is completely and utterly cleaned out near the halfway by a dreadful challenge from Doorsoun. The Germany defender catches Mead around knee high with the studs. Doorsoun is booked but it really should be a red card. I know it\u2019s a friendly but the referee has got that wrong. On the upside, Mead is up and about. 29 mins: Walsh plays a lovely pass out to Mead on the left wing, allowing the Arsenal player to attack the full-back and lift in a cross, which is turned behind by defender. England are trying to be smart with their corners - this one is played shot and back to Mead who whacks it straight out for a goal kick. 27 mins: The crowd get very excited very time England instigate an attack but also seem deeply worried whenever they have to defend. Here is Germany\u2019s opener ... 25 mins: Germany break on England from a corner, ending with Buhl cutting into the area and hitting a low shot at goal but Earps gets down well and holds on. C Noyes has been on again: \u201cPossibly a good time to mention that the USA\u2019s second goal in the WC semifinal came from several failed attempts to play out of the back. Lionesses lost possession and did not recover it until Telford stooped down to pick the ball our of her own net. Not sure what Phil\u2019s playing at.\u201d 23 mins: Houghton takes matters into her own hands and whacks a long ball for White to compete for. England then win the second ball but White is tackled, it might have been a foul, and the ball is turned over. Then Parris gets round the back of the defence and pulls a cross back from the byline but it\u2019s turned behind. This is the first bit of intent England and shown and they need to keep it up. 21 mins: Phil Neville is shouting a lot on the touchline. More terrible defending from England, allows Buhl to collect the ball in space 20 yards from goal, turn and fire a shot off which flies well wide. 19 mins: Williamson plays a 30-yard pass across the box to Houghton which she just about gets to first but is then dispossessed on the edge of the box, needlessly putting pressure onto the defence. Some of England\u2019s thinking at the back defies logic. Germany get a corner which results in some pinball inside the box but England just about manage to get it clear after a few shots at goal. 17 mins: It is far too easy for Germany on the flanks, aided by the fact England\u2019s full-backs are playing ridiculously narrow when defending. Greenwood was inside the box when Hendrich had the ball on the touchline. A cross is chipped into the box for Oberdorf to flick towards goal but Earps is equal to it. 15 mins: England\u2019s passing has been very sloppy. First Houghton and then Walsh misplace simple passes. They really need to start focusing on the task in hand her otherwise it could be a long evening in the rain. 13 mins: Heindrich is once again allowed space to whip in a cross but on this occasion Starke gets underneath the ball and heads it high and wide. 11 mins: Can England recover from that? They have been second to almost everything in the opening 11 minutes or so. Bronze tries to bring some impetus to the game, but overruns the ball and smashes into Kleinherne Poor defending from England allows Hendrich to lift an early cross into the box to Popp, who directs the ball into the corner from eight yards and through Earps\u2019 hands. The goalkeeper really should keep that out - it\u2019s another bad mistake from Earps in an international. 8 mins: Mead tries to send a through ball for White to latch onto but Doursoon reads it and slides in to intercept before the striker can get to the ball. 6 mins: England are passing it around the back as they look to settle into the game. Sadly, the first pass to go forward is intercepted. It\u2019s a nice theory to pass the ball around defence but there needs to be something better at the end of it. 4 mins: Off the bar! Germany run at the England defence, before the ball is played through to Popp in space, who whacks a shot from inside the box only to see Earps tip it onto the bar and over. Germany look the more confident in the early stages. 2 mins: A couple of early offsides in the opening stages, hopefully the game gets a bit of a more fluid flow to it. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! There is a pre-match moment of Remembrance, attended by numerous British military personnel, which will include a minute\u2019s silence. C Noyes has been in touch: \u201cHave a hunch Germany are going to give England a beating and the termination of the Reign of Phil will be discussed in earnest. They look like a team that has decided it wants a new manager.\u201d I suspect the FA will only take action if things get bad in competitive games. He is trying different things, admittedly they\u2019re not working, but there is still time. The officials seem genuinely excited to be at Wembley in front of a huge crowd. They might not be so pleased after they give a controversial decision. The ground does not look 100 per cent full right now but the extra space is being taken up by waving flags. Speaking on BBC, Neville points out the team are yet to reach the heights expected of them since the World Cup but says he has full faith in this team. The pundits have got massive umbrellas as it is bucketing it down at Wembley. I hope Gabby Logan has laminated her notes. Some good news for Phil ... It is very wet in London, once again. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s not put anyone off attending. Phil Neville thinks England have plenty more to give in the future. Let\u2019s see if he gets any of that today. They are getting up to the levels we have talked about in terms of professionalism that I want. Back in the first six months it was \u2018I say, you do, I say, you do,\u2019 in terms of driving the culture. Now I\u2019ve got the players and captains in particular that are driving the culture from within. I have taken a step back in terms of being that person that always drives things because ultimately from a learning point of view, it is better peer to peer telling each other what to do in terms of standards than me always driving that. From a playing point of view I still think we have got another 10 to 15 per cent to go from what I see as really perfect football and that is what we are working on and that is what I want to see.\u201d Additionally, let\u2019s see how Phil Neville can sort out this England team ... A lovely story of being a committed fan of the England women\u2019s team ... I played 11-a-side earlier and with the scores at 2-1, I took control of the ball of the left flank, beat two players down the wing, got to the byline and sent an a cross with the outside of my right foot, which was headed home. I am expecting a statue of me to be built on Blackheath in the next week. Walsh is at the base of the midfield. Her importance to Manchester City was proven when she missed their defeat to Arsenal due to suspension, as City could not control the tempo which she helps to do thanks to her passing capabilities. It\u2019s certainly a big day at Wembley ... Earps gets the nod in net. She had a poor game against Brazil at the Riverside but has been a standout performer in the WSL, so deserves another chance to prove herself to be an England No 1. Speaking of Demi Stokes ... My far more esteemed colleague Suzanne Wrack says this is the best team. I think this XI is the most balanced available and it\u2019s great to see White back to lead the line following injury. I personally think it\u2019s a bit of a toss up between Greenwood and Stokes at left-back, so the latter will feel aggrieved to miss out. Lucy Bronze remembers having to pay for her own kit ... England: Earps, Bronze, Houghton, Williamson, Greenwood, Scott, Nobbs, Walsh, Mead, White, Parris Germany: Frohms, Kleinherne, Hendrich, Oberdorf, Starke, Marozsan, Popp, Dabritz, Buhl, Magull, Doorsoun Good afternoon! A lot has rightly been made of the record crowd expected at Wembley today but there is plenty of intrigue on the pitch. England have struggled in recent times, winning just once in six matches, including a lot of mediocre performances as Phil Neville looks to find the right formula going forward but his chemistry so far has not found the solution. In a recent friendly against Brazil, England were pretty woeful for large parts, meaning improvement is certainly required on the big stage. England do not have best record against Germany, having won just once in 25 fixtures, losing 20 of them, so the game will be a barometer of where this current crop of players are at. In terms of the crowd, it will be a fine sight to see a packed Wembley for such a fixture and hopefully everyone involved will thrive on the extra support. These are the kind of occasions the women\u2019s game need to continue the upward curve they have enjoyed in recent years. Let\u2019s just hope it\u2019s a cracking spectacle.",

Every political ad is labelled so you can see who has paid for them.

The party also prepared and briefly sent out a \u201cLet the people decide\u201d message, referring to a second referendum, and has run several versions of ads attacking tuition fees and universal credit. The Tory party has used a number of messages claiming that politicians like Jeremy Corbyn are not respecting the result of the Brexit vote\u201d in a bid to present the election as \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d. It has trialled a series of ads depicting Corbyn stuffing Remain votes into a ballot box while discarded Leave votes lie all around. Who Targets Me?, which is funded by organisations including the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust and the Open Society Foundations and has partnerships with universities across Europe and the US, said the ads mainly targeted \u201cWorkington man\u201d \u2013 the archetypal voter parties must attract. Its analysis shows that four of the images of Corbyn and the ballot box generated more money, which suggests the party has been honing its campaign in response to online feedback. Who Targets Me?, whose browser extension allows people to find out who is aiming material at them, said the parties were treating Facebook users as \u201clab rats in a giant experiment\u201d as they decide which messages and visuals to use in the campaign. The researcher, Tristan Hotham, said that political parties had until now lagged behind marketing agencies in their use of \u2018\u201cA/B\u201d testing \u2013 comparing two or more versions of an ad to determine which one performs better. The process might appear benign, he warned, but it can have negative consequences. \u201cThis allows you to find the most effective negative message about a politician and then send it explicitly to whomever it will reverberate with the most,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is hypercharging negative politics.\u201d For political parties, Facebook is now a more effective tool than focus groups. \u201cYou can test way more messages, in real time,\u201d said Hotham. The Tory party has been investing the most in this. In August it spent \u00a328,000, compared with Labour\u2019s \u00a319,000. It spent \u00a367,000 last month and \u00a348,000 in November so far. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is probably the tip of the iceberg. Parties will get better at using these tools, so we need regulation now to make sure it\u2019s done fairly and openly on all sides,\u201d Jeffers said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to our democracy.\u201d Last week a group of researchers, technologists, digital rights defenders and internet users called on Google and Facebook to stop hosting political ads until after the election. \u201cThe online advertising model, which depends on vast collection of data and opaque ad targeting systems is not fit for purpose and thus fundamentally undermines trust in political advertising,\u201d they claimed. Facebook\u2019s UK Head of Public Policy, Rebecca Stimson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve tightened our rules to make political ads much more transparent, so people can see who is trying to influence their vote and what they are saying. \u201cAnybody who wants to run political ads must go through a verification process to prove who they are and that they are based here in the UK. Every political ad is labelled so you can see who has paid for them. Anybody can click on any ad they see on Facebook and get more information on why they are seeing it, as well as block ads from particular advertisers.\u201d",

The Tories still hold a 12-point advantage over Labour but their lead is down four points since last weekend. The Conservatives now stand on 41%, down one point on a week ago, while Labour is up three on 29%. The Liberal Democrats are down one point on 15%, while the Brexit Party has fallen sharply by three points in a week to 6%, since party leader Nigel Farage announced he would not stand as an MP. Opinium\u2019s latest data suggests Labour may be stemming the flow of both Labour Leavers to the Tories and Remainers to the Lib Dems. Some 66% of Labour Leavers now plan to vote for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party on 12 December, up nine points compared with a week ago. Similarly, 48% of Labour Remainers are planning to vote for the party, sharply up on last week. Boris Johnson is still the most popular choice for prime minister. Currently, 38% think he would make the best occupant of Downing Street, up one point from last week. Some 18% think that Jeremy Corbyn would be the best prime minister, his best score since August.

Jones headed the University of East Anglia\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Climate Research Unit,</a> from which a tranche of emails had just been hacked and made public. These, it was claimed, showed that he and fellow researchers were faking the evidence that suggested our planet was heating up dangerously.</p> <p>The affair was dubbed Climategate by those who deny the existence of global warming and it remains one of modern society\u2019s most troubling affairs. Many observers believe it helped delay measures that might have slowed climate change and given humanity more time to cut atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, its key cause.</p> <p>Climategate marks its 10th anniversary this month \u2013 an opportune moment to reflect on just how serious was its impact on society, and to look at the effect it had on those who were trying to stop Earth from being ravaged by rising seas, spreading deserts, disappearing coral reefs and suffocating heat.</p> <p>At the time, climate-change deniers were desperate to find ways to undermine the idea that global warming was real, and as Jones\u2019s unit <a href=\"http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/documents/421974/1245969/Reports.pdf/d9f96b4c-387c-4dba-83fe-7e0911eb73c6\" title=\"\">had provided key data</a> that supported this notion \u2013 by showing how land temperatures on Earth had been rising sharply in recent decades \u2013 his work was considered fair game. So they responded gleefully by ransacking his hacked emails for signs he may have been fiddling results and asserted, in blogs, they had found telltale signs.</p> <p>These claims were then picked up by media outlets hostile to global warming. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1230635/Scientist-climate-change-cover-storm-told-quit.html\" title=\"\">Scientist in climate cover-up told to quit</a>\u201d ran one headline. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/scientists-in-stolen-e-mail-scandal-hid-climate-data-hgzr5ktz330\" title=\"\">Scientists broke law by hiding climate data</a>\u201d, claimed another.</p> <p>Jones was vilified. \u201cWithin a day or two reporters were outside my house, knocking on my neighbours\u2019 doors, digging for dirt,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI got hundreds of abusive and threatening emails. I knew the accusations were nonsense. But as someone used to being in control I buckled at the loss of it. My health deteriorated. I found it difficult to sleep and eat. I was under intense, spiralling pressure and felt I was falling to pieces.

      "bodyText": "The email that appeared on Phil Jones\u2019s computer screen in November 2009 was succinct. \u201cJust a quick note to encourage you to shoot yourself in the head,\u201d it said. \u201cDon\u2019t waste any more time. Do it today. It is truly the greatest contribution to mankind that you will ever make.\u201d Nor was it very different from the other emails that were arriving in Jones\u2019s inbox. Others described the climate scientist as the scum of the earth. Some authors promised to kill him themselves. Most of the messages were riddled with obscenities. All made troubling reading. As to the cause of this outpouring of hatred, that was straightforward. Jones headed the University of East Anglia\u2019s Climate Research Unit, from which a tranche of emails had just been hacked and made public. These, it was claimed, showed that he and fellow researchers were faking the evidence that suggested our planet was heating up dangerously. The affair was dubbed Climategate by those who deny the existence of global warming and it remains one of modern society\u2019s most troubling affairs. Many observers believe it helped delay measures that might have slowed climate change and given humanity more time to cut atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, its key cause. Climategate marks its 10th anniversary this month \u2013 an opportune moment to reflect on just how serious was its impact on society, and to look at the effect it had on those who were trying to stop Earth from being ravaged by rising seas, spreading deserts, disappearing coral reefs and suffocating heat. At the time, climate-change deniers were desperate to find ways to undermine the idea that global warming was real, and as Jones\u2019s unit had provided key data that supported this notion \u2013 by showing how land temperatures on Earth had been rising sharply in recent decades \u2013 his work was considered fair game. So they responded gleefully by ransacking his hacked emails for signs he may have been fiddling results and asserted, in blogs, they had found telltale signs. These claims were then picked up by media outlets hostile to global warming. \u201cScientist in climate cover-up told to quit\u201d ran one headline. \u201cScientists broke law by hiding climate data\u201d, claimed another. Jones was vilified. \u201cWithin a day or two reporters were outside my house, knocking on my neighbours\u2019 doors, digging for dirt,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI got hundreds of abusive and threatening emails. I knew the accusations were nonsense. But as someone used to being in control I buckled at the loss of it. My health deteriorated. I found it difficult to sleep and eat. I was under intense, spiralling pressure and felt I was falling to pieces. Looking back I suppose I was having some kind of a nervous breakdown.\u201d So what had Jones said in his emails to trigger these attacks? In one message Jones says he would be emailing a journal \u201cto tell them I\u2019m having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor\u201d. This was interpreted as being a bid to suppress academic criticism. \u201cWe\u2019re choosing the periods to show warming,\u201d he says in another email that seems to suggest he was fiddling his data. And then there was his remark that he was going to employ \u201cMike\u2019s trick\u201d to use data that would \u201chide the decline\u201d. In other words, he was going to cover up data that showed the world was really cooling and was not warming, it was claimed. The Mike in question was Michael Mann, professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University, who had worked with Jones for years. His \u201ctrick\u201d was no more than a simple technique to combine the records of temperatures measured directly by thermometer with estimates made from tree rings (which roughly reflect temperature variations). \u201cIn fact, the email was an entirely innocent and appropriate conversation between scientists,\u201d Mann states in this week\u2019s BBC Four documentary, Climategate: Science of a Scandal. He and Jones were merely trying to find appropriate ways of illustrating a graph of global temperature changes. This view was not shared by Sarah Palin: the former US vice-presidential candidate wrote a Washington Post op-ed article that claimed the emails \u201creveal that leading climate \u2018experts\u2019 \u2026 manipulated data to hide the decline in global temperatures\u201d. Subsequent investigations by journalists showed these claims were unsupportable, however. Guardian writer Fred Pearce studied the leaked emails and produced a book, The Climate Files, from his research. \u201cHave the Climategate revelations undermined the case that we are experiencing made-made climate change?

This point is emphasised by Fiona Fox, head of the UK\u2019s Science Media Centre. \u201cBritish climate science was subjected to huge scrutiny by the world\u2019s best journalists and it stood up to the test.

      "bodyText": "Crewe won 2-0 at Accrington Stanley in an extraordinary three-hour FA Cup first-round tie that ended with just one assistant referee after an injury crisis among the officials. The first referee, Neil Hair, limped off in the 22nd minute and was replaced in the middle by the fourth official, Alan Clayton \u2013 but he picked up an injury and was unable to return for the second half. Crewe took the lead through Charlie Kirk in first-half stoppage time, but the interval lasted over an hour as the two sides discussed how to deal with the situation. One of the assistant referees, Danny Gratton, eventually took the whistle, but with neither injured official able to run the line, the match resumed with just one assistant. Supporters from both sides volunteered to step in, but the managers agreed to restart with an official short. The second half kicked off at 5.10pm \u2013 and a coin-toss decreed that the remaining assistant, Conor Brown, would supervise the Crewe half of the pitch only. Crewe were awarded a penalty on 67 minutes, after Jerome Opoku\u2019s foul on Tommy Lowery \u2013 in the half of the field without an assistant. Chris Porter fired home the spot-kick to double the visitors\u2019 lead. Ten minutes later, Stanley were reduced to 10 men when Mark Hughes was sent off for bringing down Owen Dale. By that time, many home fans had left, and the game eventually ended more than three hours after it had kicked off. The Crewe manager, David Artell, said that the game could have been paused to give the fourth official time to warm up. \u201c[Clayton] said at half-time that he was injured. I am not surprised because the fourth official doesn\u2019t have time to warm up properly.\u201d \u201cI would like to see him given 10 minutes to get his body temperature up and perhaps warm up with some sprints,\u201d he added. \u201cI know it would delay the players for 10 minutes but then you don\u2019t run the risk of the officials getting another injury.\u201d On the half-time delay, Artell said: \u201cThe son of [Accrington assistant] Jimmy Bell offered to do it and I agreed, but then he didn\u2019t want to do it.

The National League North side led through Omar Holness, but late goals from Caolan Lavery and Alfie Bates looked to have rescued the League Two strugglers \u2013 only for Jarrett Rivers to earn Darlo a draw in the 96th minute. Sunderland were held by Gillingham at the Stadium of Light, as goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin\u2019s howler cancelled out Aiden McGeady\u2019s opener for the hosts. McLaughlin looked to have held Olly Lee\u2019s free kick comfortably, but spilled the ball through his legs to gift the Gills a replay. That was one of 12 Saturday first-round ties to end in a draw, with League One promotion-chasers Ipswich held at home by Lincoln, and Southern Premier League Central side Stourbridge drew 2-2 with Eastleigh, who levelled late on through Scott Rendell. Rotherham had to come from behind at 10-man Maidenhead, Matt Crooks sealing victory with the Millers\u2019 third goal in a nine-minute spell in the second half. Callum McFadzean\u2019s early goal earned League Two Plymouth victory at League One\u2019s bottom side, Bolton Wanderers. National League South side Maidstone are into the second round after Dan Wishart\u2019s deflected strike earned victory over Torquay, and Ben Turner struck late for Notts County as they won 3-2 at Ebbsfleet.",

However, deniers have not given up their opposition to plans to curtail fossil fuel use and among their new tactics they have also tried to encourage \u201cdoomism\u201d, as Mann put it. \u201cThis is the idea that we are now so late in the game [in tackling global warming] that there is nothing that we can do about the problem,\u201d he added. \u201cBy promoting this doom and gloom attitude this leads people down a path of despair and hopelessness and finally inaction, which actually leads us to the same place as outright climate-change denialism.\u201d This is the new climate war, said Mann, and it is just as dangerous as the old one which focused on outright denial of the science. This new approach has a veneer of credibility, he added. It seems reasonable to many people. And that makes it, to some extent, even more dangerous, Mann concluded.",

      "bodyText": "A Hong Kong private equity group that manages billions of dollars, Pacific Alliance Group, is financing the troubled One Circular Quay luxury apartment building spearheaded by exiled businessman Huang Xiangmo. A mortgage over the prime slice of Sydney land is held by a British Virgin Islands company called Global Enterprise Opportunity VIII, which the Guardian has established is a vehicle through which one of Pacific Alliance Group\u2019s investment funds has funnelled money into the development. Pacific Alliance Group, or PAG, denies that Global Enterprise Opportunity VIII is in any way affiliated with Huang or his family. PAG is perhaps best known for its investment in Eastern Australia Agriculture and a controversial water deal that netted investors $80m. Not only was the deal done without tender, but it soon emerged that the energy minister, Angus Taylor, had been a director of EAA and its Cayman\u2019s based parent, Eastern Australian Irrigation, before entering parliament. Founded by Taylor\u2019s friend from Oxford Chris Gradel, who is chief investment officer, PAG and the other investors were able to realise a $52m gain on the water rights sold in the EAA deal. Another investor, EF Realisation fund, which held 9.6% of the Cayman\u2019s based fund, told the London stock exchange it was the highest price ever paid for water by the Australian government. Taylor faced questions in parliament over what became known as \u201cwatergate\u201d, but he has repeatedly said he resigned his directorships before entering parliament in 2013, and that he did not benefit from the water deal. Sydney\u2019s most expensive dirt The uncertain fate of One Circular Quay, which remains nothing more than a hole in some of Sydney\u2019s most expensive dirt, is among a series of controversies surrounding Huang. Huang\u2019s Australian residency was cancelled on character grounds in December and he is now believed to be living in Hong Kong, from where he has mounted a blistering attack on the Australian Taxation Office after it obtained a $140m freezing order against him. On Twitter, the exiled billionaire has also called for an investigation into an $11m fee he paid to Sydney lawyer Sevag Chalabian, who used to represent the Obeid family. The money, paid in connection with the purchase by Huang\u2019s Yuhu group of a retail and commercial property development, has been described by seller Seph Glew as an \u201cintroduction fee\u201d. One Circular Quay, which when completed is to contain more than 300 luxury apartments and a hotel complex in two towers located on the corner of George Street and Alfred streets, has changed hands several times, and is now apparently in the hands of a fourth developer, elusive Chinese-born businessman Zhang Bo, a Huang associate who bought the company that owns the site from Yuhu in late 2018. Huang is reported to have retained the development rights, although a property industry source said the financial scaffolding behind the development has recently been restructured. Even the City of Sydney Council, which approved the redevelopment in conjunction with the state government is unsure about who owns it. The council continues to deal with the same team of architects and planners who were employed by the Dalian Wanda group, which secured the approval. Zhang\u2019s sudden emergence as a key building developer in Australia has come after Huang\u2019s residency was revoked and his assets frozen. Evergrande enters the deal Zhang has previously been linked to the world\u2019s most valuable real estate company Evergrande, which raises the question about whether it is now in control of the prime site. But there are few answers about what is happening at One Circular Quay, fronting the shores of Sydney Harbour between the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge and with views across the water to Kirribilli and Admiralty Houses. The development has endured a troubled recent history. The site, which was once home to Gold Fields House, was owned by US investment firm Blackstone, which sold it to Dalian Wanda Group in 2015 for $415m. Late in that year, the project was approved by the City of Sydney, with a 57-storey 184-apartment residential tower and a 179-room hotel on the 4,040sqm site. Final approval was granted in 2017. But Dalian Wanda Group, its expansion driven by highly-leveraged acquisitions, was placed on a watchlist by Chinese regulators in 2017, part of a Chinese government drive against private-sector debt hurting the country\u2019s financial system. How Huang Xiangmo swooped When Dalian Wanda, headed by China\u2019s richest man Wang Jianlin came under pressure from the Chinese government, the Yuhu Group \u2013 then run by Huang Xiangmo \u2013 was part of a consortium that swooped, picking up the Sydney project, and the Gold Coast Jewel development at Surfers Paradise, for $1.13bn. The other actor in that purchase was Zhang Bo. His new company Dachang Australia, took a half share for $565m. Huang\u2019s Yuhu took the other half. But company records show Yuhu Group sold the site in 2018 and now appears to have exited the company behind the development, AWH Investment Group. AWH is now controlled by two companies Cuilam and Dachang, both controlled by Zhang. Huang\u2019s family members are no longer directors, with his son, Jimmy, resigning as a director of AWH in May 2019. Huang and other family members resigned during 2018. The transaction was several months old before the tax office hit Huang with a freezing order on all of his assets in Australia and around the world, pursuing him for $140m in an allegedly unpaid tax bill, penalties, and interest. Zhang is not only linked to Huang through the One Circular Quay deal, but has a history with Evergrande, one of the largest property developers in the world. Cuilam Investments, Zhang\u2019s company, acquired Evergrande\u2019s dairy products business for about $60m in 2016. Cuilam continues to maintain ties with Evergrande after the sale. It has extensive investments in New Zealand. Evergrande\u2019s chairman, Xu Jianyin, is best known in Australia after he was given 90 days in 2015 to sell a $39m Point Piper mansion by then treasurer Joe Hockey, after the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) found it had been purchased illegally. The property was purchased by the mysterious Lola Wang-Li, an Australian citizen, who lives in a Pyrmont apartment. The Australian Financial Review, in investigating Zhang, found he spent $37m over the past two years buying six houses in Sydney\u2019s Beauty Point, on the lower north shore of Sydney harbour. Zhang has declined interview requests from the media. It\u2019s not known if he is currently in Australia. Huang has not responded to detailed questions from The Guardian about the status of One Circular Quay and his role in it.",

In NSW, a positive detection from a dog does not constitute the legal criteria for conducting a strip search.</p> <p>But the LECC heard evidence that officers used indicators such as a person\u2019s nervousness following the indication from the dog, like in Elies\u2019s case, to form their suspicion.</p> <p>That, experts say, is too shallow a basis on which to form a reasonable suspicion because nervousness is a natural reaction to an interaction with a drug dog.</p> <p>Peta Malins, a lecturer in criminology and justice studies at the RMIT University in Victoria, this year published a study on the emotional impact of drug dog detections and strip searches.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone I spoke to who had been stopped by police as part of a drug dog detection reported really quite significant embodied responses about fear and anxiety coming up for them in that exchange,\u201d she told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cHands shaking, sweating, heart rate increasing. Even if they knew they\u2019d done nothing wrong and had no drugs, they still felt really anxious and fearful in that encounter.</p> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s really problematic that police might be relying on nervousness as an indicator about whether to search someone or take them aside for strip searches.\u201d</p>",

Then, on Friday, the NSW deputy coroner released the findings of her inquest into the deaths of six young people from MDMA toxicity at music festivals across the state. Besides recommending a pill-testing trial in NSW and the complete scrapping of the use of drug-detection dogs at festivals, Harriet Grahame said strip searches should be dramatically curtailed to only being used in cases of suspected supply. Her published findings revealed that in the 2018-19 financial year, 91% of strip searches were conducted on suspicion the person was in possession of drugs.

The use and legality of strip-search powers in NSW has been placed under increased scrutiny since the Law Enforcement and Conduct Commission held public hearings for its investigation into the potentially illegal strip search of a 16-year-old girl at a 2018 music festival. During the inquiry the LECC\u2019s commissioner, Michael Adams QC, said he was considering whether the practice of making people squat during a search was legal. \u201cBut squatting is not the only problematic area in strip searches that requires greater clarification,\u201d he said. Under the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act, or Lepra, police in NSW are allowed to conduct a strip-search outside a police station if the \u201cseriousness and urgency of the circumstances\u201d make it necessary. Critics have long argued that \u201cbroadly defined\u201d threshold fails to give police clear guidance on when a strip-search should be carried out. On Thursday, Labor\u2019s shadow police minister, Lynda Voltz, told Guardian Australia she believed the act was not specific enough and as a result the police interpretation of when a search was justified was \u201cvery loose\u201d. During the LECC inquiry, Adams asked a police officer under what circumstances \u2013 apart from a suspicion someone was hiding drugs in a body cavity, which police are not allowed to search \u2013 it would be urgent for an officer to conduct a strip search at a music festival. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any, actually,\u201d the officer replied before admitting that all 19 of the searches he conducted at the 2018 Splendour in the Grass festival may have been illegal. Grahame added her own voice to that point in her findings, saying it was likely that searches are being conducted \u201cunlawfully\u201d. \u201cGiven the number of times that searches occur when there is no emergency or risk of serious harm, one can only assume that many searches are conducted unlawfully including many which occur at music festivals,\u201d she wrote. Also subject to scrutiny is the basis on which a search is executed. In NSW, a positive detection from a dog does not constitute the legal criteria for conducting a strip search. But the LECC heard evidence that officers used indicators such as a person\u2019s nervousness following the indication from the dog, like in Elies\u2019s case, to form their suspicion. That, experts say, is too shallow a basis on which to form a reasonable suspicion because nervousness is a natural reaction to an interaction with a drug dog. Peta Malins, a lecturer in criminology and justice studies at the RMIT University in Victoria, this year published a study on the emotional impact of drug dog detections and strip searches. \u201cEveryone I spoke to who had been stopped by police as part of a drug dog detection reported really quite significant embodied responses about fear and anxiety coming up for them in that exchange,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cHands shaking, sweating, heart rate increasing. Even if they knew they\u2019d done nothing wrong and had no drugs, they still felt really anxious and fearful in that encounter. \u201cSo it\u2019s really problematic that police might be relying on nervousness as an indicator about whether to search someone or take them aside for strip searches.\u201d",

These lists turn over daily. We discuss her forthcoming outing to bridge, will she stay for the whole session or come home for lunch?</p> <p>Later in the morning I hear her talking to one of her<strong> </strong>cronies. It is usually about health issues. She says, referring to me, \u201cSandy had a couple of NRMA scans on her upper and lower abdomen.\u201d Mum has always had a fine line in malapropisms.

Ten years ago, she had to stop driving because she accidentally accelerated into a neighbour\u2019s letterbox. Then she had a second hip operation after falling over in her bedroom. Five years ago, she was doing quite well although she was forced to use a walker. But it did not stop her moving around the garden heedless of family warnings about the possibility of life-threatening falls.</p> <p>A family member started talking about a variety of \u201cnice facilities\u201d for mum. What? Oh, you mean an old people\u2019s home.

She loves her GP and feels safe when in constant consultation. She has regular injections in her right eyeball to relieve a swollen artery that is affecting the retina. She has hearing aids that always seem to need checking, cleaning, recalibrating. She has to see her optometrist to get her glasses updated.

And so it continued into my 40s and 50s. I did not pay all that much attention to my parents until my father had a massive stroke and died at the relatively young age of 65. Then I woke up.</p> <p>Now I look at my mother and ask her, did you always want velvet upholstered chairs, a china cabinet full of crystal and silver, Frenchified bedroom furniture?

Seven patients, who were previously living in Adelaide, Port Augusta and Alice Springs for treatment, have already returned home to continue dialysis at the four-chair, two-nurse Purple House centre at Pukatja, 30km across the SA border in the Musgrave Ranges. Purple House is an Aboriginal community-controlled health service that provides dialysis in 17 remote communities and a mobile unit called the Purple Truck, which allows patients to head back home to visit family, for festivals, funerals and other cultural business. The Purple Truck this year trekked to Arnhem Land so that patients could attend Garma festival while receiving life-saving treatment. One of those in the chair at Garma was the actor Jack Thompson. The Purple House began with an auction of paintings at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2000, when Papunya Tula artists from Walungurru and Kiwirrikurra developed four collaborative paintings that were auctioned with a series of other work and raised over $1m. Since the centre \u2013 which is entirely Indigenous owned and run \u2013 began, central Australia has gone from having the worst survival rates for kidney disease to some of the best in Australia. The Purple House chief executive, Sarah Brown, said the clinic at Pukatja was the culmination of a decade of work by patients, their families and the community. \u201cTen years ago, Kinyin McKenzie knocked on the door of the Purple House in Alice Springs, homesick for his community and looking for somewhere that would let him boil up a chicken in a billy,\u201d Brown said. \u201cOur directors welcomed him in.

      "bodyText": "This week was a pretty big one for climate change, the drought and the ALP, and they were all somewhat intertwined. On Wednesday an article published in the journal BioScience, co-signed by 11,000 scientists, warned \u201cclearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency\u201d. The authors noted that, despite 40 years of solid scientific research pointing to the dangers of climate change, \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions are still rapidly rising, with increasingly damaging effects on the Earth\u2019s climate\u201d, and that \u201can immense increase of scale in endeavours to conserve our biosphere is needed to avoid untold suffering due to the climate crisis.\u201d This of course is pretty horrific news but at least there was some good news here in Australia, because the next day, for the first time ever, the national energy market produced more than half of its electricity via renewable sources. Of course no one in the government thought it worthy of celebrating or even mentioning \u2013 mostly because it happened in spite of the government\u2019s policies, not because of them. And it is possible to come up with effective national, bipartisan policy on climate change. We saw it this week when on Thursday New Zealand passed legislation committing the nation to achieving zero net carbon emission by 2050. That same day our Department of Agriculture released a report into droughts by the coordinator-general for drought, Major General Stephen Day. It was pretty upfront about what is happening. The fourth paragraph of the forward stated: \u201cAs a consequence of climate change, drought is likely to be longer and more severe in some regions and over broader areas. It means that farmers and communities in some regions are likely to see drought more often\u201d. And just in case you needed it underlined, it continued: \u201cultimately, the nation could see some areas of Australia become more marginal and/or unproductive\u201d. That very same day (it really was a busy Thursday) the prime minister and the leader of the Nationals released the government\u2019s drought package. At no stage during the press conference was climate change raised once. That was despite Day\u2019s report finding \u201cclimate change, and the increased frequency and severity of drought in some regions, is considered the most serious threat to land management\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning And just to top it all off, also released that same day was the ALP\u2019s review into its election loss, in which the politics of climate-change policy was given a very strong focus. This in effect is politics in Australia \u2013 the LNP is at best expected to pretend to look like it cares, while receiving barely any heat for doing nothing, while the ALP is expected to actually come up with a real policy and at the same time receive all the heat for attempting to do something. Last week Katharine Murphy and Adam Morton revealed the government had quietly appointed an expert panel to come up with a climate change policy that will lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It would be nice to have some hope that this might actually lead to a policy that does something substantial, but watching LNP climate change policy over the past 30 years forces one to assume the result will be a policy that looks like the government is doing something while in reality it is just another lie that somehow greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced without any economic pain to anyone. Meanwhile the ALP report noted that the Coalition sought to \u201cassert Labor\u2019s climate change policy was not costed\u201d. And that \u201cLabor\u2019s inability to respond effectively played into the Coalition\u2019s characterisation of Labor as a risk\u201d. This is true to an extent. The assertion that it was not costed was false, but the reality was the media in large parts fell for the Liberal party line. And the reason they fell for it was an underlying assumption that we could (nay, should!) somehow compare the costs of a 45% cut in emissions as recommended by scientists with the cost of a 24% cut in emissions which once carryover credits were included was really closer to a 15% cut. It meant that the ALP needed (and as the report noted, largely failed) to \u201ceffectively discuss the cost of not acting on climate change.\u201d This is hard enough to do alone, it is nigh on impossible when few in the media are bothering to challenge the LNP with those costs as well. Instead we remain trapped in a cycle where we find yet another drought assistance package presented all the while the government\u2019s own documents state climate change will cause more of them. And it means we\u2019re trapped in a cycle where effectively promising to keep doing the short-term response indefinitely is viewed as a long-term policy. Murphy was right to note that the crucial element of the ALP\u2019s review is squaring the often countervailing forces of traditional blue-collar workers and wealthier inner-city-dwelling progressives. The answer is not to put up the white flag on climate change, and the report makes that clear, noting: \u201ca modern Labor party cannot deny or neglect human-induced climate change. To do so would be wrong, it would cause enormous internal instability and it would be a massive electoral liability\u201d. It also notes the need to focus on the employment and economic positives of the change. This is absolutely a must. The transition to zero emissions will be tough \u2013 if it wasn\u2019t we would already have done it. But it needs to be enticing, exciting and desired. The US Democratic party has its Green New Deal, and the UK Labour under Corbyn has very much linked the switch to renewables with jobs. It really is a no-brainer for Australia to be a world leader in renewable production and technology. Anthony Albanese has rightly set off on this path \u2013 his speech in Perth a week ago made this a key issue. But it will need more than just a few speeches. It is going to need a policy and a campaign that inspires people, because that is what great progressive policy does.

But mostly Hurley, a former teacher and the wife of the governor general, David Hurley, has one song for everyone: You Are My Sunshine. Since the Hurleys moved from New South Wales Government House in May back to Canberra, the song has become a staple that she deploys to boost morale of staff and guests at official functions. \u201cBut just the chorus, the verses are sad,\u201d she says. I\u2019ve spent the morning watching Hurley wander between tables of war widows (average age 81, according to the governor general), microphone in hand, leading them in song over cucumber and smoked salmon sandwiches. Every song is an all-in special and not knowing the words is no excuse \u2013 guests are provided a Government House song book so they don\u2019t stumble as they are led through a repertoire that includes It\u2019s a Long Way to Tipperary, When the Red, Red Robin and Singin\u2019 in the Rain. \u201cMy biggest passion is to get people to sing,\u201d Hurley tells Guardian Australia. \u201cAustralia, I believe, has had it beaten out of them \u2013 if you weren\u2019t perfect, if you didn\u2019t get picked in the choir, that person goes away for the rest of their life believing they can\u2019t sing. \u201cI can\u2019t say how many men have told me that they can\u2019t sing.

      "bodyText": "As the impeachment inquiry continued to cast dark clouds over the White House, Donald Trump said he was preparing to release details of a second call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. \u201cWe have another transcript coming out which is very important,\u201d Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before leaving for Alabama and a college football game. \u201cI will give you a second transcript, because I had two calls with the president of Ukraine.\u201d The impeachment inquiry centres on a 25 July call between Trump and Zelenskiy in which, according to an incomplete memo released by the White House and repeatedly and incorrectly referred to by Trump as a \u201cperfect\u201d transcript, the US president asked his Ukrainian counterpart to \u201cdo us a favour\u201d. Testimony released this week has painted a damning picture of attempts to persuade Ukraine to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, potentially in return for an unfreezing of nearly $400m in military aid and a White House meeting with Trump. The 25 July call and concerns over its content became known when an intelligence official filed an anonymous report. Trump and allies such as the Kentucky senator Rand Paul have led Republican pressure for the media to name the whistleblower, contrary to federal law. On Saturday, House Republicans said Hunter Biden and the whistleblower should be called to testify in public hearings set to begin next week. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, reportedly said he was \u201cevaluating\u201d the list but added that the inquiry \u201cwill not serve \u2026 as a vehicle [for] the same sham investigations into the Bidens or 2016 that the president pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit\u201d. Trump said his new \u201ctranscript\u201d would probably be released on Tuesday. He also characterised the impeachment inquiry as \u201ca lot of witch-hunt\u201d but said Republicans defending him \u201chave never been so united\u201d. On Friday night, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney asked to join a lawsuit that seeks a ruling on whether senior advisers to Trump must testify in the impeachment inquiry. The move came on the same day Mulvaney became the latest senior White House aide not to comply with a subpoena to appear before Democrat-led House committees receiving testimony in private. The suit he wants to join was filed in October by Charles Kupperman, former deputy to former national security adviser John Bolton. House Democrats have not served a subpoena to Bolton, whose lawyer said on Friday he had information about \u201cmany relevant meetings and conversations\u201d. Bolton has warned he will seek legal recourse if a subpoena is sent. In a game of legal chess, Kupperman\u2019s subpoena has been withdrawn. White House counsel Pat Cipollone has claimed senior aides do not have to comply with impeachment inquiry subpoenas, a claim that is fiercely contested. But career officials from the National Security Council and state department have testified in private. Mulvaney found himself in the crosshairs after admitting last month that aid to Ukraine was held up and telling reporters to \u201cget over it\u201d, an admission he sought to retract. This week, transcripts of testimony by White House aides linked Mulvaney to offers of a Trump meeting for Zelenskiy, if he agreed to investigate the Bidens and a conspiracy theory which says Ukraine, not Russia, intervened in the 2016 US election. In a filing quoted by the Washington Post, Mulvaney\u2019s lawyers said the issue of whether senior aides should testify \u201cgo[es] to the heart of our representative government and its promise to secure individual liberty by dividing the awesome power of government amongst itself\u201d. \u201cMr Mulvaney, like Mr Kupperman, finds himself caught in that division, trapped between the commands of two of its co-equal branches \u2013 with one of those branches threatening him with contempt. He turns to this court for aid.\u201d When Kupperman\u2019s suit was filed, many observers said it was merely a delaying tactic. Critics of Cipollone\u2019s position say it disregards the oversight role of Congress as set out in the constitution. Speaking to the Guardian on Friday, Frank O Bowman III, author of High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump and a professor at the University of Missouri school of law, said the White House \u201cgag rule\u201d on senior advisers testifying was \u201ccompletely abnormal\u201d. Bowman said: \u201cInasmuch as the no-shows are in response to presidential orders or strong admonitions, they amount to obstruction of the House\u2019s constitutional impeachment function and are therefore a free-standing ground for impeachment.\u201d On Saturday, in a letter to Schiff, ranking Republican intelligence committee member Devin Nunes called for the whistleblower to testify and claimed: \u201cAmericans see through this sham impeachment process.\u201d Other individuals Nunes said should testify included Devon Archer, an associate of Hunter Biden; former Democratic National Committee staffer Alexandra Chalupa; and Nellie Ohr, a \u201cformer contractor for opposition research firm Fusion GPS\u201d, which commissioned the famous Steele dossier on links between Trump and Russia. The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, reported that two Ukrainian Americans entangled in the impeachment inquiry pushed previous Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko to investigate the Bidens and the conspiracy theory regarding 2016. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman worked with Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor commonly described as Trump\u2019s personal attorney, on approaches to Ukraine. Parnas and Fruman have been charged with campaign finance offences. Giuliani has defied congressional demands for relevant documentation. According to released testimony, Giuliani\u2019s role in apparent extra-governmental foreign policy caused alarm among national security staffers. Fiona Hill, a British-born Russia expert, told the committees Bolton characterised Giuliani as \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up\u201d. According to Hill, Bolton also said he was \u201cnot part of whatever drug deal [EU ambassador Gordon] Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Andrew Roberts is a historian and journalist. He is a visiting professor at the Department of War Studies, King\u2019s College London, and also has positions at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and the Lehrman Institute at the New York Historical Society. His latest book, <em>Leadership in War</em>, looks at nine leaders from Napoleon to Margaret Thatcher, examining how they performed in conditions of war.</p> <p><strong>What were your selection criteria for your nine subjects?</strong><br>They were highly subjective. I was giving a series of speeches to the New York Historical Society, so I didn\u2019t choose FDR or Lincoln or Washington, despite their being great war leaders, simply because I didn\u2019t think there was anything I could teach the Americans about any of those people. I\u2019m not pretending the nine I\u2019ve chosen are the nine top leaders in war, by any means. They\u2019re just the people who interested me in, really, an incredibly self-indulgent act of serendipity.</p> <p><strong>History is written by the victors, but can </strong><strong>someone lose a war and remain a great leader?</strong><br>Napoleon is the key exception to the rule. I think Adolf Hitler was a successful war leader up till June 1941, but then he fell off a little [laughs], so I have included him because there are lessons to be learned about the errors. But, yes, I think it\u2019s possible. Even though it was for a bad cause, Robert E Lee can\u2019t be considered anything other than a great war leader.</p> <p><strong>There is a tendency to see truly great leaders as men and women of destiny. Is there any value in that belief?</strong><br>No, I think it\u2019s a form of psychological disorder to think you are specially destined. Napoleon did. Hitler also did. He believed his survival from the assassination plotters on 20 July 1944 was providence. But to believe you\u2019re specially chosen \u2013 apart from Jesus \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much a prima facie case of psychological disorder. Having said that, we\u2019re very lucky that Winston Churchill did have that extremely egotistical disorder, because it kept him fighting, even when all seemed lost.</p> <p><strong>What does leadership in war teach us about leadership in peace?</strong><br>I think this is where the great leadership-studies industry, especially in America, pretty much breaks down. Because they are very different things. We see that again in Churchill\u2019s career: he wasn\u2019t a very good peacetime leader, frankly, but a great wartime one. Which is why when people say that Boris Johnson thinks he\u2019s Winston Churchill, I think he\u2019s clever enough to spot that the wartime and peacetime prime minister are entirely different things.</p> <p><strong>Napoleon from Corsica, Hitler from Austria and Stalin from Georgia. Why did they come to embody French, German and Russian nationalism with such conviction?</strong><br>You can go further. Wellington was from Ireland, Alexander the Great from Macedonia. You can also consider Margaret Thatcher a social outsider, coming from Grantham, yet leading a party ruled by social insiders. I think it\u2019s a driving force in people, the sense of being outside and wanting to prove to the world that you\u2019re just as good as anyone born inside.</p> <p><strong>Who has achieved a reputation as a great wartime leader that they don\u2019t deserve?</strong><br>I think [Paul von] Hindenburg and [Erich] Ludendorff. The more we read about the Battle of Tannenberg, especially of course in Norman Stone\u2019s wonderful book <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/237/23752/the-eastern-front-1914-1917/9780140267259.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Eastern Front</em></a>, the more you realise there was a good deal of pure luck in that victory. So I think their reputation was largely undeserved.</p> <p><strong>Of the nine you\u2019ve selected, which leader do you most admire for their actions in war?</strong><br>I come back to Napoleon every time really, even though he was not a great orator, and personally his morality was not the best. But when it comes to the broad appreciation of leadership as an art \u2013 even though he lost, of course \u2013 again and again, he\u2019s the prime exemplar of war leadership.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the last </strong><strong>great book </strong><strong>you read?</strong><br>I am quite lucky because I am chairman of the Lehrman Institute military history book prize, so I get to give a cheque for $50,000 to the winner.

      "body": "<p>Cry #NeverCorbyn. Cry #NeverBrexit and you soon realise Britain is now a #NeverNeverLand of self-cancelling double negatives. The only way, it seems, to stop one extremist in #NeverNeverLand is to vote for another. The only way to save #NeverNeverLand from a rightwing disaster is to vote for a leftwing disaster. If you believe in fairies, Peter Pan says clap your hands and Tinker Bell won\u2019t die. When set against what the British are being asked to believe in the general election campaign, belief in fairies sounds modest.</p> <p>In a plea that might have been made by the anti-fascists of the 1930s, the <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/comment/leaders/to-all-our-fellow-british-citizens-1.491812\" title=\"\"><em>Jewish Chronicle </em>asked </a>all citizens to walk in the shoes of British Jewry and not vote for Jeremy Corbyn. It asked: \u201cHow can the racist views of a party leader \u2013 and the deep fear he inspires among an ethnic minority \u2013 not be among the most fundamental of issues?\u201d So devoutly does the former Labour minister Ian Austin believe in #NeverCorbyn that he is telling \u201cdecent, traditional, patriotic Labour voters\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/former-labour-mp-ian-austin-urges-voters-back-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">to support Boris Johnson</a> at this election.</p> <p>The trouble is that #NeverCorbyn and #NeverBrexit are incompatible. In many constituencies, the only way to stop Brexit is to vote for the Labour candidate, assuming he or she is an honourable pro-European, which, looking at the <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/politics/elections/general-election-2019/labour-candidate-ian-byrne-wrote-abusive-comments/\" title=\"\">thugs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7653965/Labour-candidates-anti-whites-slur-Zarah-Sultana-centre-race-row.html\" title=\"\">fruit loops</a> Labour is offering the citizenry, may be an assumption too far. The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Greens have vowed to unite to defend our membership of the EU. But their offer to put forward unity candidates is redeemable in only 60 seats.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Lib Dems will fight to destroy the few decent members of the parliamentary Labour party left: Rosie Duffield in Canterbury, for example, and Neil Coyle in Southwark. Labour supporters, meanwhile, will punish the Lib Dems for austerity rather than stand aside in the interest of removing Jacob Rees-Mogg in Somerset or Dominic Raab in Surrey.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People cling to their tribe, however ugly and dangerous its leader is. This is Johnson and Corbyn\u2019s best hope</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The absurdity of Britain\u2019s position was captured by the young political writer <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Adam.Barnett/johnson-or-corbyn-what-an-insult-dont-be-bullied-into-ratifying-this-farce-78ee4ae0d990\" title=\"\">Adam Barnett</a>. Millions will reluctantly say #NeverCorbyn and support Johnson, while accepting that he lies as easily as others breathe. \u201cVote for the liar because he will deliver on his promises\u201d will be their slogan. Millions will reluctantly say #NeverBrexit and support Corbyn, even though they know he is an ally of racists who has supported Brexit since entering parliament. \u201cVote for the Brexiter antisemite to stop Brexit and deliver social justice\u201d will be theirs.</p> <p>The propaganda of emotional blackmailers is already everywhere. If you don\u2019t vote for Corbyn, you hate the poor. If you don\u2019t vote for Johnson, you love the suicide bombers. I want to emphasise instead how hard it is to persuade voters to defend their society by switching their votes. We have two possible futures: one that contains a fleeting flash of hope and a second that is thoroughly miserable but is no more than we deserve.</p> <p>Pacts against extremists can be organised, as long as there is only one of them. Twice this century, the French left has swallowed all its principles except the most important principle of all: the need to stop the far right seizing control of the republic. In <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2002/05/09/jacques-chirac-wins-by-default\" title=\"\">the 2002 presidential election</a>, under the stirring slogan \u201cVote for a crook, not for a fascist\u201d, it supported the conservative Jacques Chirac and stopped Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme-right Front National, becoming president. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/french-election-emmanuel-macron-marine-le-pen-front-national-melenchon-left-wing-a7716461.html\" title=\"\">the left backed Emmanuel Macron</a> against Marine Le Pen. Anyone who finds comparisons with the French far right offensive should consider that Ms Le Pen has watched the Brexit disaster that Johnson and Nigel Farage brought and concluded that advocating French withdrawal from the EU was too extreme a policy for <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/retreating-eurosceptics-now-settle-for-reforms-from-within/\" title=\"\">even the French far right to endorse. Meanwhile</a>, Corbyn has engaged with antisemites as gruesome as any the Front National supported. </p> <p>The conservatives of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Trump_movement\" title=\"\">#NeverTrump</a> movement tried to imitate the French left in the 2016 US presidential elections. Trump was a pornographic slob, a sociopath and a clear and present danger to the US constitution, they warned. Every word was true. The logic of their argument was that moderate conservatives had to vote for Hillary Clinton. They didn\u2019t in sufficient numbers, for a reason that bears on the British crisis. However absurd their judgment appeared to outsiders, too many conservatives regarded Clinton as just as extreme as Trump.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If enough Liberal Democrats, Greens and nationalists win, they can limit Johnson or Corbyn\u2019s worst excesses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once that view has taken hold, people cling to their tribe, however ugly and dangerous its leader is. This is Johnson and Corbyn\u2019s best hope. They want their nervous supporters to be scared into voting for them for fear of the other.</p> <p>Britain does not face a binary choice. After Johnson\u2019s purge, the Tory benches will be full of hard-faced hacks determined to impose Brexit, whatever the cost. Momentum will ensure the next batch of Labour MPs will contain more incontinent cranks than any country deserves. We are about to elect a parliament of freaks and fanatics. If, however, enough Lib Dems, Greens and nationalists win, they can act as a blocking minority that will limit Johnson or Corbyn\u2019s worst excesses.</p> <p>But there I go, playing fantasy politics. The fate of the #NeverTrump movement shows the likely fate of Britain. David Frum, one of its doughtiest spokesmen, tells me the experience of Trump in power is giving it a belated vindication. In the midterms and last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/politics/kentucky-governor-virginia-election.html\" title=\"\">elections in Pennsylvania and Virginia</a>, it was not just young, educated voters and minorities who voted against Trump but wealthy suburbs that remain in many other respects conservative.</p> <p>On this reading, Britain will have to experience a Johnson Brexit or a Corbyn government before enough voters turn against them. It is as if large sections of the population have reverted to childhood and must learn all over again that there are no fairies in our #NeverNeverLand, only monsters.</p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cry #NeverCorbyn. Cry #NeverBrexit and you soon realise Britain is now a #NeverNeverLand of self-cancelling double negatives. The only way, it seems, to stop one extremist in #NeverNeverLand is to vote for another. The only way to save #NeverNeverLand from a rightwing disaster is to vote for a leftwing disaster. If you believe in fairies, Peter Pan says clap your hands and Tinker Bell won\u2019t die. When set against what the British are being asked to believe in the general election campaign, belief in fairies sounds modest. In a plea that might have been made by the anti-fascists of the 1930s, the Jewish Chronicle asked all citizens to walk in the shoes of British Jewry and not vote for Jeremy Corbyn. It asked: \u201cHow can the racist views of a party leader \u2013 and the deep fear he inspires among an ethnic minority \u2013 not be among the most fundamental of issues?\u201d So devoutly does the former Labour minister Ian Austin believe in #NeverCorbyn that he is telling \u201cdecent, traditional, patriotic Labour voters\u201d to support Boris Johnson at this election. The trouble is that #NeverCorbyn and #NeverBrexit are incompatible. In many constituencies, the only way to stop Brexit is to vote for the Labour candidate, assuming he or she is an honourable pro-European, which, looking at the thugs and fruit loops Labour is offering the citizenry, may be an assumption too far. The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Greens have vowed to unite to defend our membership of the EU. But their offer to put forward unity candidates is redeemable in only 60 seats. Elsewhere, the Lib Dems will fight to destroy the few decent members of the parliamentary Labour party left: Rosie Duffield in Canterbury, for example, and Neil Coyle in Southwark. Labour supporters, meanwhile, will punish the Lib Dems for austerity rather than stand aside in the interest of removing Jacob Rees-Mogg in Somerset or Dominic Raab in Surrey. The absurdity of Britain\u2019s position was captured by the young political writer Adam Barnett. Millions will reluctantly say #NeverCorbyn and support Johnson, while accepting that he lies as easily as others breathe. \u201cVote for the liar because he will deliver on his promises\u201d will be their slogan. Millions will reluctantly say #NeverBrexit and support Corbyn, even though they know he is an ally of racists who has supported Brexit since entering parliament. \u201cVote for the Brexiter antisemite to stop Brexit and deliver social justice\u201d will be theirs. The propaganda of emotional blackmailers is already everywhere. If you don\u2019t vote for Corbyn, you hate the poor. If you don\u2019t vote for Johnson, you love the suicide bombers. I want to emphasise instead how hard it is to persuade voters to defend their society by switching their votes. We have two possible futures: one that contains a fleeting flash of hope and a second that is thoroughly miserable but is no more than we deserve. Pacts against extremists can be organised, as long as there is only one of them. Twice this century, the French left has swallowed all its principles except the most important principle of all: the need to stop the far right seizing control of the republic. In the 2002 presidential election, under the stirring slogan \u201cVote for a crook, not for a fascist\u201d, it supported the conservative Jacques Chirac and stopped Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme-right Front National, becoming president. In 2017, the left backed Emmanuel Macron against Marine Le Pen. Anyone who finds comparisons with the French far right offensive should consider that Ms Le Pen has watched the Brexit disaster that Johnson and Nigel Farage brought and concluded that advocating French withdrawal from the EU was too extreme a policy for even the French far right to endorse. Meanwhile, Corbyn has engaged with antisemites as gruesome as any the Front National supported. The conservatives of the #NeverTrump movement tried to imitate the French left in the 2016 US presidential elections. Trump was a pornographic slob, a sociopath and a clear and present danger to the US constitution, they warned. Every word was true. The logic of their argument was that moderate conservatives had to vote for Hillary Clinton. They didn\u2019t in sufficient numbers, for a reason that bears on the British crisis. However absurd their judgment appeared to outsiders, too many conservatives regarded Clinton as just as extreme as Trump. Once that view has taken hold, people cling to their tribe, however ugly and dangerous its leader is. This is Johnson and Corbyn\u2019s best hope. They want their nervous supporters to be scared into voting for them for fear of the other. Britain does not face a binary choice. After Johnson\u2019s purge, the Tory benches will be full of hard-faced hacks determined to impose Brexit, whatever the cost. Momentum will ensure the next batch of Labour MPs will contain more incontinent cranks than any country deserves. We are about to elect a parliament of freaks and fanatics. If, however, enough Lib Dems, Greens and nationalists win, they can act as a blocking minority that will limit Johnson or Corbyn\u2019s worst excesses. But there I go, playing fantasy politics. The fate of the #NeverTrump movement shows the likely fate of Britain. David Frum, one of its doughtiest spokesmen, tells me the experience of Trump in power is giving it a belated vindication. In the midterms and last week\u2019s elections in Pennsylvania and Virginia, it was not just young, educated voters and minorities who voted against Trump but wealthy suburbs that remain in many other respects conservative. On this reading, Britain will have to experience a Johnson Brexit or a Corbyn government before enough voters turn against them. It is as if large sections of the population have reverted to childhood and must learn all over again that there are no fairies in our #NeverNeverLand, only monsters. \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

Keep your eyes on St Mary\u2019s in particular, where a heavy defeat for either side could well result in a desk being cleared on Monday morning. Elsewhere there\u2019s a clash of styles at St James\u2019 Park, where Eddie Howe\u2019s entertainers take on Steve Bruce\u2019s thrill-killers \u2013 Bournemouth able to climb to fifth a win \u2013 and a quietly intriguing meeting in north London, where newly promoted minnows will very much fancy their chances at the home of last season\u2019s Champions League finalists. Funny old game.</p> <p><strong>In the Championship</strong>, West Brom travel to Hull looking to maintain their position at the summit, though a failure to win could see them leapfrogged by one or all of Preston, Leeds and Swansea. And Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s first in charge of rock-bottom Stoke is against \u2026 second-bottom Barnsley. Lovely stuff.</p> <p><strong>Oh, and to offset all that garish glamour</strong>, there\u2019s a full 27 [twenty-seven] FA Cup ties to boot, with Nantwich Town, AFC Fylde and Solihull Moors all in action.

And last but not least, from Turf Moor: The match report from Spurs v Sheffield United: And our take from St James\u2019: And here\u2019s our live coverage of England\u2019s Lionesses\u2019 big game at Wembley, where none other than Germany are the visitors. D\u00fcnnpfiff time for Phil Neville? Here\u2019s our match report from St Mary\u2019s: More important lessons in German. \u201cAs an Austrian I cannot accept those awful German synonyms for squits,\u201d writes Jan Krcmar. \u201cHasenh\u00fcttl would not say D\u00fcnnpfiff, but Scheisserei. That would be like claiming that cockneys greet each other by saying \u2018a\u2019rite lad\u2019. Hasenh\u00fcttl would not say any of the words you typed, because he is not a Piefke (German).\u201d Today\u2019s very tasty teatime game is Leicester against Arsenal, which can be followed here: AFC Wimbledon 1-1 Doncaster Rovers Accrington Stanley 0-1 Crewe Alexandra Blackpool 4-1 Morecambe Bolton Wanderers 0-1 Plymouth Argyle Cambridge United 1-1 Exeter City Carshalton Athletic 1-4 Boston United Cheltenham Town 1-1 Swindon Town Colchester United 0-2 Coventry City Crawley Town 4-1 Scunthorpe United Ebbsfleet United 2-3 Notts County Forest Green Rovers 4-0 Billericay Grimsby Town 1-1 Newport County Ipswich Town 1-1 Lincoln City Maidenhead United 1-3 Rotherham United Maidstone United 1-0 Torquay United Mansfield Town 1-0 Chorley Milton Keynes Dons 0-1 Port Vale Nantwich Town 0-1 AFC Fylde Oxford City 1-5 Solihull Moors Salford City 1-1 Burton Albion Shrewsbury Town 1-1 Bradford City Stevenage 1-1 Peterborough United Stourbridge 2-2 Eastleigh Tranmere Rovers 2-2 Wycombe Wanderers Walsall 2-2 Darlington Birmingham City 0-1 Fulham Leeds United 2-1 Blackburn Rovers Reading 3-0 Luton Town Barnsley 2-4 Stoke City Hull City 0-1 West Brom Millwall 2-1 Charlton Athletic Preston North End 3-1 Huddersfield Town Queens Park Rangers 2-2 Middlesbrough Sheffield Wednesday 2-2 Swansea City Wigan Athletic 0-3 Brentford Second v third ends in a stalemate. Stow remain unbeaten in the league. And that\u2019s full time across the country. Full updates to follow \u2026 More highbrow correspondence: \u201cIf West Ham smartarses want to use \u2018wherefore\u2019 correctly,\u201d writes Russell Richardson, \u201csurely they ought to say \u2018Roberto, Roberto, wherefore art thou Roberto\u2019, which is a good question, actually.\u201d Good point well made. More German lessons, as Oliver Bandmann skids into the conversation: \u201cCould I be very anal and insist on CAPITAL letters at the beginning of Flitzkacke, Duennpfiff, Duenschiss, please? May I also quote the Germany defender Andreas Brehme: \u2018Haste Scheisse am Fuss, haste Scheisse am Fuss\u2019 (\u2018If you have shit sticking to your foot, you have shit sticking to your foot\u2019). You may indeed. I wonder if Jorge Valdano speaks German. Two wins on the trot for Steve Bruce! Rafael who? \u0141ukasz, \u0141ukasz, wherefore art thou, \u0141ukasz? (And yes, smartarses, I know it doesn\u2019t actually mean where) Bravo, Blades. The story of the season so far. Flitzekacke! \u2026 but it comes to nowt. D\u00fcnnpfiff! Stoppage-time at St Mary\u2019s, and James Ward-Prowse stands over a deal ball \u2026 Nick Godwin adds his voice to the ever-thinning contingent of VAR advocates: \u201cFractions count \u2013 the difference between gold and silver can be a millimetre. It\u2019s a sport. Gone are the days when everyone EXCEPT the ref, knew it was offside.\u201d Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s first week on the Stoke job is going swimmingly, by the way: they\u2019re now 4-1 up at Barnsley, Sam Clucas adding to his earlier halfway-line effort with another long-rang belter. Give that man a coconut. Back to our German class. Tony Webb writes: \u201cSpelling and that - OK, it\u2019s a fair cop. To make amends I am happy to add both flitzkacke / flitzekacke and d\u00fcnnpfiff to your growing collection of German words meaning the squits.\u201d Splendid. I\u2019ve found one. A VAR proponent! \u201cI\u2019m in favour of VAR,\u201d writes Joseph Harvey. \u201cCompletely got rid of foul play and violent conduct in the World Cup, and for that alone is worth it. Remember when Alli punched someone during play? That doesn\u2019t happen anymore. VAR could be improved, but on the whole the game is better (and more just, which is important to the players) with it than without it.\u201d The Blades get a hard-earned equaliser, George Baldock\u2019s cross sneaking in. They don\u2019t get to celebrate mind, thanks to the joylessness of an interminable VAR check. But they\u2019re level. AFC Wimbledon 1-1 Doncaster Accrington Stanley 0-1 Crewe Blackpool 3-1 Morecambe Bolton Wanderers 0-1 Plymouth Argyle Cambridge United 0-1 Exeter City Carshalton Athletic 0-2 Boston United Cheltenham Town 0-0 Swindon Town Colchester United 0-2 Coventry City Crawley Town 1-0 Scunthorpe United Ebbsfleet United 1-2 Notts County Forest Green Rovers 4-0 Billericay Grimsby Town 1-0 Newport County Ipswich Town 0-1 Lincoln City Maidenhead United 1-0 Rotherham United Maidstone United 1-0 Torquay United Mansfield Town 0-0 Chorley Milton Keynes Dons 0-1 Port Vale Nantwich Town 0-1 AFC Fylde Oxford City 0-5 Solihull Moors Salford Cit 0-0 Burton Albion Shrewsbury Town 1-1 Bradford City Stevenage 1-0 Peterborough United Stourbridge 2-1 Eastleigh Tranmere Rovers 2-2 Wycombe Wanderers Walsall 0-1 Darlington Hassenh\u00fcttl geht der Arsch auf Grundeis! Richarlison makes a tricky chance look easy, volleying home his fifth goal of the season, and things suddenly look very grim for the Saints. Twenty minutes for them to find a reply. A flurry of Var-related emails following the shenanigans at White Hart Lane. I\u2019ll spare you the specifics, but safe to say everyone is on the same page. The question is: is literally anyone in favour any more? A note to Fifa: there\u2019s no shame in just calling it all a failed experiment. Birmingham City 0-1 Fulham Leeds United 2-1 Blackburn Rovers Reading 2-0 Luton Town Barnsley 1-2 Stoke City Hull City 0-1 West Brom Millwall 1-1 Charlton Athletic Preston 3-0 Huddersfield Town Queens Park Rangers 2-1 Middlesbrough Sheffield Wednesday 0-1 Swansea City Wigan Athletic 0-1 Brentford That Roberto own-goal, by the way: not good. Not good at all. Sheffield United\u2019s equaliser is disallowed three minutes (and countless carefully-measured green lines) after it was scored, McGoldrick judged offside. But it\u2019s fractional to the point of nonexistent. Cue outrage. The visitors have been superb, by all accounts. A third goal in four days goal for Son, who punishes an Enda Stevens mistake, collecting a loose pass to drive past Henderson and into the net. A turnaround on Tyneside. Ciaran Clark with a messy finish but Steve Bruce won\u2019t mind. Two-one Oh dear god. Roberto, at fault for both Burnley\u2019s first two goals, has just punched a third into his own net. Perfect hattrick. Don\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you. A hopeful Wales fan writes: \u201cBit of a long shot but if there are any Welsh fans in eastern Anatolia overlanding from Wales to Baku for next weeks qualifier fancy a beer in Erzurum tonight?\u201d If so, tweet @Dic_Penderyn. More correspondence from Berlin. Kristof responds: \u201cI have to correct Tony, it\u2019s spelled d\u00fcnnschiss. You could also say flotter otto (\u2018brisk otto\u2019) while we\u2019re at it.\u201d This is getting very anal. And Ralf Hassenh\u00fcttl will be gerade d\u00fcnnschei\u00df a little bit less now, Danny Ings converting Sofiane Boufal\u2019s cross to level things up. \u201cAnyone know know what the story is with Michael Keane?\u201d asks Dean Kinsella. \u201cDoesn\u2019t appear to be injured. Has he fallen that far from grace?\u201d I believe so - he\u2019s on the bench today, and has been in shoddy form this term. More German lessons, this time from Tony Webb in Berlin: \u201cThe word you are looking for is D\u00fcnnschei\u00df \u2013 literally \u2018thin s***\u2019, ie Ralf hat gerade d\u00fcnnschei\u00df = \u2018Ralf is s****ing himself at the moment\u2019\u201d Many thanks.

Chris Woods meet a glorious cross with an equally glorious header to double the hosts\u2019 lead. Nope: VAR rules it out. Offside. West Brom had dropped to lowly third for a while there, with Preston and Leeds both winning. But they\u2019ve reclaimed top spot or the time being: Jake Livermore opens the scoring at Hull. Leeds lead against Blackburn, Patrick Bamford converting from the spot to notch his first goal since August. (Relative) giant-killing news, Solihull Moors lead at Oxford City, and Ebbsfleet against Notts County. Stoke are ahead at Barnsley, Sam Clucas channelling his inner David Beckham/Dejan Stankovic/Charlie Adam to score from the halfway line and get Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s tenure off to a splendid start. Sam Hutchinson has put Millwall in front against Charlton, Jayden Stockley has scored for Preston against Huddersfield, Reading lead Luton thanks to Michael Morrison and Wigan are behind to a goal from Brentford\u2019s Bryan Mbeumo. Oh, and Britt Assombalonga has just broken the deadlock for Middlesbrough at QPR. Goalless everywhere else. Darlington of the National League are ahead at Walsall. A (relative) giant-killing on the cards? \u2018We\u2019d say Hassenh\u00fcttl geht der Arsch auf Grundeis,\u201d writes Kristof K\u00fcnssler-McIlwain from Berlin, \u201cwhich means he\u2019s shaking in his boots a.k.a. squeaky bum time.\u201d Not quite a compound noun, but it\u2019ll do. Danke. Surrealist cartoonists: a lot more prescient than you\u2019d think: A Bournemouth set-piece Straight Off The Training Ground\u2122 leaves the Liverpool loanee with a simple finish. Lovely stuff. Over to you, Brucey. We mentioned West Ham\u2019s dodgy keeper Roberto before that game \u2013 or rather, Michael Allen did \u2013 and sure enough, it\u2019s taken just the 12 minutes for him to cost his side a goal. A flap from a corner leads to Ashley Barnes tapping in. Get well soon, \u0141ukasz Fabia\u0144ski. Both keepers in action already at St James\u2019, Dubravka saving a point-blank Fraser shot, and Ramsdale stopping from Willems. Presented without comment: The Toffees are in front at St Mary\u2019s, Tom Davies sneaking in from a corner to nod home unmarked. Is there a German compound noun for a loudly squeaking manager\u2019s bum? Games are under way across the country, including at Catons Lane, where its second against third in the Essex Senior League Premier Division, Saffron Walden Town hosting the mighty Walthamstow FC, whose heroic promotion charge could take a further boost with a victory. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be updated on that one too. And here\u2019s the full report on Derby\u2019s derby defeat: Sunderland and Gillingham have drawn in the FA Cup, which means this clanger from Jon McLaughlin has cost his side a replay. Eeek. Pre-kickoff reading: a lovely interview with Peter Reid that manages to live up to its quite magnificent headline Here\u2019s our reporter\u2019s take on Chelsea\u2019s defeat of Crystal Palace: Meanwhile, JR emails from Illinois (not Dallas?) with the following philosophical riddle: \u201cIf Cenk Tosun is the answer, what\u2019s the question?\u201d Indeed. Although I increasingly suspect that that answer for Everton is less \u201cCenk Tosun\u201d and more \u201ca new manager\u201d. And if we\u2019re asking questions, then what about this one: where the hell\u2019s Moise Kean? \u201cHow can Roberto guy start another game for West Ham?\u201d asks a despairing Michael Allan via email. \u201cHe will cost them the game again today just like the last two weeks!\u201d You may very well be right, Michael, but I suspect the answer to your question is that the third-choice keeper is [checks notes] David Martin, whose career highlights involve four years at Liverpool (zero appearances) and 11 outings across two seasons at Millwall. But Roberto certainly has something of a reputation to salvage in wake of his recent displays. Buena suerte, amigo. And it\u2019s full-time at the City Ground, where bragging rights have been formally issued to Nottingham Forest. One-nil. All over at Stamford Bridge \u2013 Chelsea go second. And that\u2019s six league wins in a row, although I\u2019d ward against them getting too giddy given the vanquished opponents have been Palace, Watford, Burnley, Newcastle, Southampton and Brighton. Still, you can only beat what\u2019s put in front of you. Man City away next. Some interesting selections amid all that. Mauricio Pochettino, having hit on a winning formula against Red Star in midweek, has promptly gone and changed both his full-backs (although he\u2019s kept the midfield and frontline as was), while Cenk Tosun comes into the Everton side after his late equaliser last weekend, in place of Alex Iwobi, whose misplaced pass cost his side a goal. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019d be dubious of any manager who finds a place for Theo Walcott in his side but not Iwobi. But what do I know. Another goal at Stamford Bridge, where Christian Pulisic, in from the cold and on a hot streak, puts Lampard\u2019s Lambs two up. Burnley: Pope, Bardsley, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor, Hendrick, Westwood, Cork, McNeil, Barnes, Wood West Ham United: Roberto, Fredericks, Diop, Balbuena, Cresswell, Rice, Noble, Fornals, Snodgrass, Felipe Anderson, Haller Southampton: McCarthy; Bednarek, Stephens, Vestergaard, C\u00e9dric; Ward-Prowse, Romeu, Armstrong, Djenepo; Ings, Redmond Everton: Pickford; Sidib\u00e9, Mina, Holgate, Digne; Schneiderlin, Davies, Walcott, G Sigurdsson; Richarlison, Tosun Newcastle: D\u00fabravka; Yedlin, Fern\u00e1ndez, Lascelles, Clark, Willems; Hayden, Shelvey; Saint-Maximin, Joelinton, Almir\u00f3n Bournemouth: Ramsdale; Smith, S Cook, Ak\u00e9, Rico; H Wilson, L Cook, Billing, Fraser; C Wilson, King Team news ahoy. Tottenham: Gazzaniga, Aurier, Dier, Sanchez, Davies, Sissoko, Ndombele, Lo Celso, Dele, Son, Kane Sheffield United: Henderson, Baldock, Stevens, Fleck, O\u2019Connell, Basham, Lundstram, Egan, Norwood, McGoldrick, Mousset. Chelsea v Crystal Palace, of course, can be followed more closely here: Scratch that. Forest are ahead. Lewis Grabban pounces on a Jayden Bogle mistake to open the scoring. In already-kicked-off news, the East Midlands derby between Nottingham Forest and Derby County is goalless, while Chelsea have just gone ahead against Crystal Palace, Tammy Abraham slotting home with aplomb. Plenty of time to go in both games. Afternoon all and welcome to a very busy Saturday afternoon indeed. In the Premier League, four frighteningly out-of-form teams combine for two games \u2013 Southampton v Everton and Burnley v West Ham \u2013 that many fans will be watching through their fingers. Keep your eyes on St Mary\u2019s in particular, where a heavy defeat for either side could well result in a desk being cleared on Monday morning. Elsewhere there\u2019s a clash of styles at St James\u2019 Park, where Eddie Howe\u2019s entertainers take on Steve Bruce\u2019s thrill-killers \u2013 Bournemouth able to climb to fifth a win \u2013 and a quietly intriguing meeting in north London, where newly promoted minnows will very much fancy their chances at the home of last season\u2019s Champions League finalists. Funny old game. In the Championship, West Brom travel to Hull looking to maintain their position at the summit, though a failure to win could see them leapfrogged by one or all of Preston, Leeds and Swansea. And Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s first in charge of rock-bottom Stoke is against \u2026 second-bottom Barnsley. Lovely stuff. Oh, and to offset all that garish glamour, there\u2019s a full 27 [twenty-seven] FA Cup ties to boot, with Nantwich Town, AFC Fylde and Solihull Moors all in action. Fire up the kettle.",

      "body": "<p>For Tottenham Hotspur this proved to be a case of one step forward and two steps back. After Wednesday\u2019s 4-0 victory over Red Star Belgrade came a result and a performance to suggest that all remains unwell with Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s men. They were outfought and outplayed by a Sheffield United side who left north London with much to cherish but also a sense of injustice given this proved to be another occasion when VAR made its presence felt in maddening fashion.</p> <p>The visitors thought they had cancelled out Son Heung-min\u2019s 58th-minute goal when, on the hour, David McGoldrick converted Enda Stevens\u2019 cross at the back post. There appeared nothing wrong with the strike but then came that now common uncertainty and dread. Referee Graham Scott had his finger to his ear, the large screen said the goal was being checked by VAR and then, after a delay of 3mins 47secs, came the verdict \u2013 no goal. Why? Because Jonathan Moss, the VAR located at Stockley Park, deemed John Lundstram\u2019s big toe had been offside in the build-up. Yes \u2013 big toe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/09/burnley-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">Roberto\u2019s gaffe ensures Burnley end poor run with win against West Ham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Or perhaps it was his right arm. Frankly it was hard to tell given the lines that were drawn on the VAR-related footage of the incident and while the decision may have been correct it ultimately did little to take away from the feeling that rather than improving football in this country, the technology is leading to its slow death.</p> <p>Firstly, it was not clear that any part of Lundstram\u2019s body was ahead of Eric Dier \u2013 the last man. On the image tweeted from the Premier League\u2019s official account, Dier\u2019s left shoulder and knee appeared to be playing the midfielder onside as he collected a pass on the right flank. And even if they were not, should the goal have been disallowed given the phases of play that followed Lundstram\u2019s eventual cross, namely Dier\u2019s clearing header, John Fleck\u2019s pass to Stevens on the left and, finally, his delivery to McGoldrick? All in all it was a mess \u2013 neither a \u201cclear and obvious\u201d error on the assistant referee\u2019s part and, given the long delay, another use of VAR that temporarily but most definitely sucked the life out of what was an absorbing encounter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea3056d5a102f88f9da6f52164326a20fb67c34d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea3056d5a102f88f9da6f52164326a20fb67c34d/0_271_3781_2269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Son Heung-Min wheels away to celebrate his opening goal against Sheffield United.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Son Heung-Min wheels away to celebrate his opening goal against Sheffield United.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sandra Mailer/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chris Wilder was phlegmatic in the aftermath but having been among the Premier League managers who met with Mike Riley, manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), on Thursday to discuss VAR, he also expressed confusion over what would have been McGoldrick\u2019s first Premier League goal.</p> <p>\u201cWhen is the reset?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s gone down the right, John\u2019s crossed it, it\u2019s come back out and we\u2019ve then attacked down the left. So where does it reset to go again? That\u2019s not clear. That length of the stoppage also doesn\u2019t do anybody any good. It affects the game and that\u2019s a disappointing aspect of it.\u201d Asked if he was tired of talking about VAR, Wilder replied: \u201c100%\u201d.</p> <p>Instead he was keen to praise his side for their display here, and rightly so. The visitors were excellent throughout, playing with typical resilience in defence and fearlessness in attack and, ultimately, it was only right that they did equalise on 78 minutes when George Baldock\u2019s cross evaded everyone and landed in the the net. And yes, it was also subject to a VAR check.</p> <p>The draw means United remain undefeated away from home since their return to the top flight. That is some going for a side tipped at the start of the campaign to make an immediate return to the Championship and they would have taken even more from this game had McGoldrick\u2019s goal stood or Lundstram, who was outstanding throughout, been more clinical with a couple of chances in the first half.</p> <p>For Tottenham this really was a bump back to earth after their impressive showing in midweek. Nine of the players who started in Belgrade also did here but, unlike then, they lacked cohesion and fluidity. Passes regularly went astray while in defence the hosts looked uncertain. Even Son\u2019s goal \u2013 his eighth of the season \u2013 was fortunate given the South Korean was only able to strike the ball through Dean Henderson\u2019s legs because of a loose backpass by Stevens. It is now five Premier League games without victory for Spurs and, on this evidence, their form is not necessarily going to improve after the international break.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you don\u2019t win you are disappointed,\u201d said Pochettino, who could also be without Tanguy Ndombele for some time after the midfielder was withdrawn at half-time with a suspected groin injury. \u201cWe did not start well and when you assess the game, a draw was fair.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "For Tottenham Hotspur this proved to be a case of one step forward and two steps back. After Wednesday\u2019s 4-0 victory over Red Star Belgrade came a result and a performance to suggest that all remains unwell with Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s men. They were outfought and outplayed by a Sheffield United side who left north London with much to cherish but also a sense of injustice given this proved to be another occasion when VAR made its presence felt in maddening fashion. The visitors thought they had cancelled out Son Heung-min\u2019s 58th-minute goal when, on the hour, David McGoldrick converted Enda Stevens\u2019 cross at the back post. There appeared nothing wrong with the strike but then came that now common uncertainty and dread. Referee Graham Scott had his finger to his ear, the large screen said the goal was being checked by VAR and then, after a delay of 3mins 47secs, came the verdict \u2013 no goal. Why? Because Jonathan Moss, the VAR located at Stockley Park, deemed John Lundstram\u2019s big toe had been offside in the build-up. Yes \u2013 big toe. Or perhaps it was his right arm. Frankly it was hard to tell given the lines that were drawn on the VAR-related footage of the incident and while the decision may have been correct it ultimately did little to take away from the feeling that rather than improving football in this country, the technology is leading to its slow death. Firstly, it was not clear that any part of Lundstram\u2019s body was ahead of Eric Dier \u2013 the last man. On the image tweeted from the Premier League\u2019s official account, Dier\u2019s left shoulder and knee appeared to be playing the midfielder onside as he collected a pass on the right flank. And even if they were not, should the goal have been disallowed given the phases of play that followed Lundstram\u2019s eventual cross, namely Dier\u2019s clearing header, John Fleck\u2019s pass to Stevens on the left and, finally, his delivery to McGoldrick? All in all it was a mess \u2013 neither a \u201cclear and obvious\u201d error on the assistant referee\u2019s part and, given the long delay, another use of VAR that temporarily but most definitely sucked the life out of what was an absorbing encounter. Chris Wilder was phlegmatic in the aftermath but having been among the Premier League managers who met with Mike Riley, manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), on Thursday to discuss VAR, he also expressed confusion over what would have been McGoldrick\u2019s first Premier League goal. \u201cWhen is the reset?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s gone down the right, John\u2019s crossed it, it\u2019s come back out and we\u2019ve then attacked down the left. So where does it reset to go again? That\u2019s not clear. That length of the stoppage also doesn\u2019t do anybody any good. It affects the game and that\u2019s a disappointing aspect of it.\u201d Asked if he was tired of talking about VAR, Wilder replied: \u201c100%\u201d. Instead he was keen to praise his side for their display here, and rightly so. The visitors were excellent throughout, playing with typical resilience in defence and fearlessness in attack and, ultimately, it was only right that they did equalise on 78 minutes when George Baldock\u2019s cross evaded everyone and landed in the the net. And yes, it was also subject to a VAR check. The draw means United remain undefeated away from home since their return to the top flight. That is some going for a side tipped at the start of the campaign to make an immediate return to the Championship and they would have taken even more from this game had McGoldrick\u2019s goal stood or Lundstram, who was outstanding throughout, been more clinical with a couple of chances in the first half. For Tottenham this really was a bump back to earth after their impressive showing in midweek. Nine of the players who started in Belgrade also did here but, unlike then, they lacked cohesion and fluidity. Passes regularly went astray while in defence the hosts looked uncertain. Even Son\u2019s goal \u2013 his eighth of the season \u2013 was fortunate given the South Korean was only able to strike the ball through Dean Henderson\u2019s legs because of a loose backpass by Stevens. It is now five Premier League games without victory for Spurs and, on this evidence, their form is not necessarily going to improve after the international break. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t win you are disappointed,\u201d said Pochettino, who could also be without Tanguy Ndombele for some time after the midfielder was withdrawn at half-time with a suspected groin injury. \u201cWe did not start well and when you assess the game, a draw was fair.\u201d",

Saracens relied on reserves here, although two of England\u2019s World Cup squad were on the bench, the hooker Jack Singleton, who came on to make his club debut, and Ben Spencer, who replaced Wigglesworth after 53 minutes. \u201cSame old Saracens, always cheating,\u201d sang spectators when Gloucester won a penalty, but the chant faded as their side were given a lesson in how to perform in a hostile climate. Cipriani played after recovering from a calf strain but was never a commanding presence and he made way for Billy Twelvetrees on the hour. Saracens were 21-5 ahead by then, profiting from their ability to turn position into points and Gloucester\u2019s tendency to play too much in their own half and lose the ball. Saracens were rarely stressed with the home side offering little beyond Ollie Thorley\u2019s menace in broken play. Gloucester\u2019s first try came out of nothing. Ben Morgan\u2019s charge out of his 22 was followed by Tom Marshall setting off 70 metres out, going past his opposite number Alex Lewington and taking out Matt Gallagher with a kick before chipping to the line and beating Maitland to the bounce. Vunipola had given Saracens the lead with a penalty after Josh Hohneck had detached from a scrum before Tompkins made it 10-0. Marshall gave the crowd a reason to crow, but Wigglesworth drew three defenders offside by delaying a pass from a ruck and Vunipola kicked the penalty before the fly-half completed the opening half\u2019s scoring with another three points. Saracens scored two quick tries from a driving maul early in the second period, but only one counted. Nick Isiekwe touched down for the first, but it was ruled out on review because Jackson Wray obstructed the defence \u2013 but not before Fraser Balmain had been lured offside. Saracens got the penalty, kicked it to touch and mauled their way over again after Tompkins and Duncan Taylor joined in. Ben Earl finished off the move. Gloucester huffed their way to a try for Lewis Ludlow after 10 minutes of penalties and pressure, but their looseness had allowed Sarries to cash in and Earl to cap a typically detached, efficient display.",

There is a great bursting out of new theatres in the city. Of very different kinds. None with public subsidy. Nicholas Hytner this year announced plans for a stage at King\u2019s Cross, backed by a small group of senior venture capital investors. At Wembley Park, Troubadour Theatres opened a giant temporary performance space this summer, in which War Horse is playing to huge audiences. Meanwhile, new small stages in the centre of town are looking enticing. The Boulevard, funded by Soho Estates, opens on the spot where there was a theatre in the 70s, described as \u201ca sister venue to the Raymond Revuebar\u201d (what sort of sorority was that?). It\u2019s a luscious, adaptable place with a pink art deco-style bar and restaurant and an auditorium, seating about 165, that can swivel, sink and rise; as well as plays, there will be late-night cabaret and standup.

      "body": "<p>Callum Roberts is professor of marine conservation at York University and was chief scientific adviser on <em>Blue Planet 2</em>. His new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/reef-life-9781788162159.html\" title=\"\"><em>Reef Life</em></a>, details a life spent in the oceans studying the marine ecosystem.</p> \n<p><strong>How was your first dive?</strong><br>It was in the north of Scotland, where I grew up. I dived out of Scrabster harbour near Thurso and I had no idea then just how bruised and trashed and scraped the whole sea had become, and how much life had been removed from it over the centuries. I was in a wetsuit that I\u2019d glued together at home. A wetsuit should hug every curve, but this one didn\u2019t. It was bloody cold.</p> \n<p><strong>Did you always want to study coral reefs?</strong><br>From early childhood I wanted to be an explorer and I held on to that desire for a long time. I realised, though, that at some point I had to earn a living. There were patches of the world that were still relatively unexplored, particularly the underwater environment. So I trained in biology and that enabled me to fulfil my childhood dream.</p> \n<p><strong>You write that heaven is a dive on a coral reef. Why is that?</strong><br>The sheer exuberance of colour and form on a coral reef is unparalleled. It\u2019s like an impressionist canvas where all the brush strokes have come to life. The corals themselves form a 3D architectural complexity with palaces and gardens. There\u2019s the play of light on the seabed, the way the waves dapple the light across the animals. It\u2019s invigorating in a way that\u2019s hard to describe.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97d19b83e428f443567236b82253f7c0960ea9ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97d19b83e428f443567236b82253f7c0960ea9ca/0_0_2121_1414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A coral reef at Ari Atoll in the Maldives.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A coral reef at Ari Atoll in the Maldives.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franco Banfi/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Any hairy moments?</strong><br>My most dangerous dives have been when I\u2019ve let my guard down and followed the wildlife into the danger zone. You can get into trouble much more easily on a coral reef than on a mountainside. From 40 metres to 60 metres you get nitrogen narcosis and from 80 metres and deeper you get oxygen poisoning. That\u2019s what really kills people. On one dive, I foolhardily went down to 60 metres. I had lost the fear of it. I didn\u2019t sense the danger. There can be very strong downcurrents that can suck you down 15 or 20 metres before you are able to inflate your jacket and counteract the pull.</p> \n<p><strong>What about sharks?</strong><br>I grew up on a diet of Cousteau and others who milked sharks for all the terror they could. They wanted to show how daring they were. It coloured my view early on, but over the years I realised the sharks are not bothered by me. Sharks do bite people, they do kill people, but not very many, and it seems to be more error than intention. A student of mine was recently diving in the Maldives where here is an incredible abundance of tiger sharks there. She saw 23 on the same dive. The tiger sharks came up to them, and some of the divers were bumped, but other than that the sharks ignored them. I\u2019m not bothered about sharks at all any more, there\u2019s only excitement and the feeling of privilege at being with these creatures.</p> \n<p><strong>How does climate change harm corals?</strong><br>What\u2019s killing corals at the moment is mass bleaching. Corals have a 100m-year-old relationship with a microscopic alga that lives in their tissues. These seaweeds produce most of the coral\u2019s food: it\u2019s what makes them the reef builders they are. But when the water warms up, the relationship goes bad and the corals have to expel the seaweeds or they will die. The problem is that a bleached coral is a starving coral, so if the temperature stays high for a while, the coral starves to death.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3a89e2d3-f0c5-4cb9-8437-0046f612ca9d\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>5.4 metres: </b>highest likely sea level rise by 2300, if global carbon emissions are not cut.<br></p>\n    <p><b>653bn tonnes: </b>average ice melted in Greenland, Antarctica and mountain glaciers every year from 2006-2016, equivalent to 500 Olympic swimming pools every minute.</p>\n    <p><b>100-1,000 times: </b>the increase in coastal flood damages expected in 2100 unless major adaptation efforts are made.</p>\n    <p><b>1.8 billion people: </b>the number likely to be directly affected by sea level rise on low-lying coasts and melting glaciers in high mountain regions in 2050.</p>\n    <p><b>1,500bn tonnes:</b> the carbon stored in permafrost, almost double all the carbon in the atmosphere.</p>\n    <p><b>7,000: </b>the number of scientific articles considered by the 104 expert authors from 36 countries.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Is bleaching the only impact of climate change?</strong><br>Acidification is also happening. Eventually, ocean acidity will reach levels that etch away exposed coral skeletons. They won\u2019t be able to build strong skeletons, or won\u2019t be able to calcify at all. How far and fast this will happen is one of the big unknowns. By 2100, it could cause massive disruption, not only to coral reefs, but to all sorts of creatures that make calcium carbonate shells: molluscs, crustaceans, plankton-like coccolithophores and foraminifera. These are prolific, widespread, economically important and ecologically crucial.</p> \n<p><strong>What damage have you witnessed?</strong><br>In the Maldives, the mass coral bleaching and death in 2015/16 was brutal. With El Ni\u0148o, you see a wave of bleaching temperatures moving from east to west. You can see it coming and there is nothing you can do about it. It\u2019s like a slow\u2011motion hurricane and you think oh my God, disaster is going to strike. When it hit the Maldives in 2016, it took out about two-thirds of the coral. On one beautiful reef where I dive, 99% of the coral died. That was so shocking, that it could be turned from this extraordinary vitality to something that looked like a concrete replica of a reef in a bad public aquarium in the space of a couple of months. We are now watching the reefs recover, but the problem for coral reefs is that the spaces between impacts are getting shorter and the extent and severity seems to be getting bigger.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/25/coral-cover-around-popular-great-barrier-reef-islands-has-almost-halved\">Coral cover around popular Great Barrier Reef islands has almost halved</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>You say the Gulf states are locked in a \u201cgigantic pissing contest\u201d over coastal development\u2026</strong><br>It\u2019s horrible in the Gulf and has been for a long time. I fear there is no way of stopping it; there is too much money sloshing around. Every new development seems to want to thrust out further into the sea, but the nearest bit of shallow water habitat is the richest and it gets covered over. Along the Red Sea coast they have carved up the reef into marinas and filled it over to create new land. It\u2019s a shocking and needless destruction of an immensely important asset, and nobody cares.</p> \n<p><strong>The Great Barrier Reef is in bad shape too. What happened?</strong><br>The Australian government has walked away from its responsibility in tackling climate change. They are in thrall to the miners, particularly the coal miners. The government is in the pocket of industry, but so is the population. Many Australians have benefited from the mining industry. They\u2019ve bought second homes on the coast and expensive boats, they can afford to take holidays overseas. It\u2019s hard to rein that in. As people said in the election this year, climate change was on the ballot paper and climate change lost. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eb8152b451f69c6de2e72a82531657def4a96ba\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eb8152b451f69c6de2e72a82531657def4a96ba/0_0_4320_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Callum Roberts preparing for a dive off the Isle of Man.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Callum Roberts preparing for a dive off the Isle of Man.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Callum Roberts</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Some scientists experience \u201cecological grief\u201d in their work. Have you?</strong><br>You feel it in your guts. It\u2019s a visceral blow to your sense of where the world is going. You hope for the best, but when you see the worst happening it\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m a hardened optimist, but even cast-iron optimists cannot be optimistic about the future of corals. What keeps the despair at bay is seeing students going out into great positions, actively contributing to protecting the world and making it a better place.</p> \n<p><strong>Have Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion made a difference?</strong><br>She is motivating a huge number of people across the world to come together and tell their leaders that they need to act. We are seeing a willingness to take action on things like greenhouse gases that wasn\u2019t there before and an urgency about it that is being thrust upon reluctant leaders. You can protest all you like without inconveniencing people and nothing happens, but when you start inconveniencing people the politicians wake up.</p> \n<p><strong>What can we do for the reefs?</strong><br>There is no real possibility across much of the world of being able to maintain, restore, or recover the reefs to the condition they were in at the start of my career.

      "bodyText": "Callum Roberts is professor of marine conservation at York University and was chief scientific adviser on Blue Planet 2. His new book, Reef Life, details a life spent in the oceans studying the marine ecosystem. How was your first dive? It was in the north of Scotland, where I grew up. I dived out of Scrabster harbour near Thurso and I had no idea then just how bruised and trashed and scraped the whole sea had become, and how much life had been removed from it over the centuries. I was in a wetsuit that I\u2019d glued together at home. A wetsuit should hug every curve, but this one didn\u2019t. It was bloody cold. Did you always want to study coral reefs? From early childhood I wanted to be an explorer and I held on to that desire for a long time. I realised, though, that at some point I had to earn a living. There were patches of the world that were still relatively unexplored, particularly the underwater environment. So I trained in biology and that enabled me to fulfil my childhood dream. You write that heaven is a dive on a coral reef. Why is that? The sheer exuberance of colour and form on a coral reef is unparalleled. It\u2019s like an impressionist canvas where all the brush strokes have come to life. The corals themselves form a 3D architectural complexity with palaces and gardens. There\u2019s the play of light on the seabed, the way the waves dapple the light across the animals. It\u2019s invigorating in a way that\u2019s hard to describe. Any hairy moments? My most dangerous dives have been when I\u2019ve let my guard down and followed the wildlife into the danger zone. You can get into trouble much more easily on a coral reef than on a mountainside. From 40 metres to 60 metres you get nitrogen narcosis and from 80 metres and deeper you get oxygen poisoning. That\u2019s what really kills people. On one dive, I foolhardily went down to 60 metres. I had lost the fear of it. I didn\u2019t sense the danger. There can be very strong downcurrents that can suck you down 15 or 20 metres before you are able to inflate your jacket and counteract the pull. What about sharks? I grew up on a diet of Cousteau and others who milked sharks for all the terror they could. They wanted to show how daring they were. It coloured my view early on, but over the years I realised the sharks are not bothered by me. Sharks do bite people, they do kill people, but not very many, and it seems to be more error than intention. A student of mine was recently diving in the Maldives where here is an incredible abundance of tiger sharks there. She saw 23 on the same dive. The tiger sharks came up to them, and some of the divers were bumped, but other than that the sharks ignored them. I\u2019m not bothered about sharks at all any more, there\u2019s only excitement and the feeling of privilege at being with these creatures. How does climate change harm corals? What\u2019s killing corals at the moment is mass bleaching. Corals have a 100m-year-old relationship with a microscopic alga that lives in their tissues. These seaweeds produce most of the coral\u2019s food: it\u2019s what makes them the reef builders they are. But when the water warms up, the relationship goes bad and the corals have to expel the seaweeds or they will die. The problem is that a bleached coral is a starving coral, so if the temperature stays high for a while, the coral starves to death. Is bleaching the only impact of climate change? Acidification is also happening. Eventually, ocean acidity will reach levels that etch away exposed coral skeletons. They won\u2019t be able to build strong skeletons, or won\u2019t be able to calcify at all. How far and fast this will happen is one of the big unknowns. By 2100, it could cause massive disruption, not only to coral reefs, but to all sorts of creatures that make calcium carbonate shells: molluscs, crustaceans, plankton-like coccolithophores and foraminifera. These are prolific, widespread, economically important and ecologically crucial. What damage have you witnessed? In the Maldives, the mass coral bleaching and death in 2015/16 was brutal. With El Ni\u0148o, you see a wave of bleaching temperatures moving from east to west. You can see it coming and there is nothing you can do about it. It\u2019s like a slow\u2011motion hurricane and you think oh my God, disaster is going to strike. When it hit the Maldives in 2016, it took out about two-thirds of the coral. On one beautiful reef where I dive, 99% of the coral died. That was so shocking, that it could be turned from this extraordinary vitality to something that looked like a concrete replica of a reef in a bad public aquarium in the space of a couple of months. We are now watching the reefs recover, but the problem for coral reefs is that the spaces between impacts are getting shorter and the extent and severity seems to be getting bigger. You say the Gulf states are locked in a \u201cgigantic pissing contest\u201d over coastal development\u2026 It\u2019s horrible in the Gulf and has been for a long time. I fear there is no way of stopping it; there is too much money sloshing around. Every new development seems to want to thrust out further into the sea, but the nearest bit of shallow water habitat is the richest and it gets covered over. Along the Red Sea coast they have carved up the reef into marinas and filled it over to create new land. It\u2019s a shocking and needless destruction of an immensely important asset, and nobody cares. The Great Barrier Reef is in bad shape too. What happened? The Australian government has walked away from its responsibility in tackling climate change. They are in thrall to the miners, particularly the coal miners. The government is in the pocket of industry, but so is the population. Many Australians have benefited from the mining industry. They\u2019ve bought second homes on the coast and expensive boats, they can afford to take holidays overseas. It\u2019s hard to rein that in. As people said in the election this year, climate change was on the ballot paper and climate change lost. Some scientists experience \u201cecological grief\u201d in their work. Have you? You feel it in your guts. It\u2019s a visceral blow to your sense of where the world is going. You hope for the best, but when you see the worst happening it\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m a hardened optimist, but even cast-iron optimists cannot be optimistic about the future of corals. What keeps the despair at bay is seeing students going out into great positions, actively contributing to protecting the world and making it a better place. Have Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion made a difference? She is motivating a huge number of people across the world to come together and tell their leaders that they need to act. We are seeing a willingness to take action on things like greenhouse gases that wasn\u2019t there before and an urgency about it that is being thrust upon reluctant leaders. You can protest all you like without inconveniencing people and nothing happens, but when you start inconveniencing people the politicians wake up. What can we do for the reefs? There is no real possibility across much of the world of being able to maintain, restore, or recover the reefs to the condition they were in at the start of my career. But it is always worthwhile to protect them. A reef that has no living coral can still sustain a huge variety of other life. Climate change is the big unmanaged stress at the moment. To give reefs the best chance of survival, we need to alleviate all the stresses we can. We need to protect them from fishing, dredging and pollution, in particular nutrient and sediment pollution. And we need to prepare for the worst. That means thinking about global refuges where coral reefs may be able to re-establish themselves if the worst of the predictions come true.

Further down their descent, Yates was forced to abandon Simpson on the mountainside. Simpson\u2019s book about his improbable survival, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/30/top10s.alpinism\" title=\"\"><em>Touching the Void</em></a>, has sold more than 1m copies and in 2003 became a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/nov/21/sportandleisure\" title=\"\">Bafta-winning film</a>.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1990/jul/31/obituaries.jonathanaitken\" title=\"\">Ian Gow</a>, the member for Eastbourne, rose to his feet on 21 November 1989 to make the first televised speech in our most ancient of parliaments, it is fair to say he wasn\u2019t too happy about it.</p> <p>\u201cI have always voted against the televising of the proceedings of this House,\u201d said the Tory MP, and he was not alone. His ire stemmed partly from a letter that had been circulated to MPs three weeks earlier, confirming in his mind the cynical and unseemly nature of the whole ghastly endeavour.</p> <p>\u201cThe impression you make on television,\u201d Gow recounted from the advice contained in the memo, \u201cdepends mainly on your image (55%), with your voice and body language accounting for 38% of your impact. Only 7% depends on what you are actually saying.\u201d</p> <p>The guidance to camera-shy members went on to say: \u201cWe can guarantee to improve your appearance through a personal and confidential image consultation. You will learn if you need a new hairstyle \u2013 and where to get it \u2013 and the type of glasses to suit your face.\u201d</p> <p>Gow considered himself \u201cbeyond redemption on both counts\u201d. Neil Kinnock sympathised, recalling that before he made his entrance on to what was now essentially a TV set, he had been handed a \u201cpapier poudr\u00e9, which looks to me like cerebral blotting papers which apparently are for mopping one\u2019s head\u201d.</p> <p>Self-deprecation aside, much of the dialogue came from MPs wearily accepting something that had divided Westminster, and been delayed by its members, for decades: the inevitability of the mass media age. Not only on the issue of picking your best side for the camera, but over deep philosophical anxieties about the nature of democracy, and the very soul of a democratic chamber itself.</p> <p>Today, as we approach the 30th anniversary of that first televised session, it is hard for most of us to imagine what the fuss was about \u2013 not least a younger generation so used to capturing and sharing almost anything and everything as part of daily life. This is especially true of the withdrawal agreement, a year-long soap opera that has seen live parliamentary coverage cross over from niche geek activity to mainstream spectator sport. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-bercow\" title=\"\">John Bercow</a>, until recently Speaker of the House, is now a star on the continent, where an app can imitate him saying: \u201cUuuuhhhder\u201d, and BBC Parliament even enjoyed a ratings spike that briefly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/23/brexit-boost-for-bbc-parliament-as-channel-briefly-outrates-mtv\" title=\"\">took it above MTV</a>. It would be hard for any democrat to argue today that a citizen has no right to see inside.</p> <p>John Reith first pushed the idea of parliamentary broadcasting as far back as the 1920s, but it was never given serious consideration until Harold Wilson arrived in No 10 for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/sep/19/harold-wilson-white-heat-technology-speech\" title=\"\">\u201cwhite heat of technology\u201d</a> revolution. What precipitated the unthinkable? The 1960s had brought a sharp rise in TV interviews and panel debates between politicians, and there was a rising sense that the \u201csupreme forum\u201d of national debate was being substituted for something baser. So in May 1965, the member for Ilford (the appropriately named Mr TL Iremonger), begged to move that \u201cthe maximum involvement of a responsible people in the processes of parliamentary government is a sure guarantee of liberty\u201d, and it was time to directly enter people\u2019s homes.</p> <p>But a select committee investigation and test screenings brought unfavourable feedback, and members voted against. As they again did in 1972. And 1975. It took more than 22 years and 11 debates before a sea-change occurred \u2013 in that bastion of forward-looking modernity, the House of Lords.</p> <p>A sort of \u201cout of town tryout\u201d was initiated in \u201cthe other place\u201d by Christopher Soames \u2013 leader of the Lords and son-in-law of the orator-in-chief, Winston Churchill \u2013 in December 1983. They tested it in January 1985, when Harold Macmillan \u2013 whose own premiership had been destined to end when he was mocked in a theatre by Peter Cook and the rest of <em>Beyond </em><em>the Fringe</em> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4XT4wg1DJk\" title=\"\">stole the show</a>.</p> <p>The Commons, whose inhabitants would be elected by those watching, after all, had many concerns. Who was going to edit the coverage? Would exhibitionists get to hog the mike? Would it change the character of the house, turning politics into mere performance \u2013 the substance, the nuance gone?</p> <p>But the die seemed cast by 1989, when the leader of the House reported back from the select committee with reassurances: \u201cEight remote-controlled cameras will be mounted just under the galleries and will be as unobtrusive as we can make them. We went into lighting with some care, as many honourable members feel passionately about the subject.\u201d</p> <p>Only a standard head-and-shoulders shot would be permitted. There would be limited use of wide-angle shots, a limit on the use of reaction shots, and a prohibition on the use of split-screen. No panning, just straight cuts. All in the interests of fair coverage and balance. It didn\u2019t take long for the pressures of \u201cgood drama\u201d to intervene. Only weeks after opening night on 21 November, the restriction on reaction shots was relaxed.</p> <p>Today, the controller of BBC Parliament, Peter Knowles, tells me that the intention is to \u201cmake you feel like you are part of the event. We see members who are actively taking part in the debate \u2013 not just when they are speaking \u2013 and in the floor-level shots you see the chamber much as the Speaker sees it, which gives some thrilling moments of drama.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s suddenly \u2013 and perhaps surprisingly \u2013 a big appetite for the authenticity and rawness.\u201d</p> <p>And it is thrilling. At least, I think so. I began watching footage of the House on the evening news as a boy in the early 90s, as the industries in my Nottinghamshire village began to disappear as a consequence of the discussions and the votes taking place on the TV. Getting to know the faces, learning the names. It\u2019s a fascination that fed into the writing of my play <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/14/this-house-scenes-execution-review\">This House</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/14/this-house-scenes-execution-review\"> for the National Theatre in 2012</a>, about the high drama of the 1974 hung parliament.</p> <p>So, have the old anxieties passed about turning the chamber into a variety hall and politics into mere performance \u2013 about parliament becoming a place where the best actors triumph over the best minds, with elected representatives in the chamber not so much speaking to each other as simply broadcasting to those outside? The motivation for Boris Johnson\u2019s war against parliament was the message being sent out to his leave base \u2013 he had little time for winning around the people sitting opposite him. And Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s final question in PMQs is no question at all, but clippable content to share among the Momentum network.</p> <p>My own local MP, Gloria De Piero, retiring this year and a former TV news star herself, champions the way the cameras force you to think of your constituents watching at home. When getting to her feet, she says: \u201cI am totally thinking about my constituents, and bringing their voice to parliament.\u201d She doesn\u2019t judge those who use the stage to grandstand and wax lyrical, \u201cbut I just can\u2019t think of the job like that\u201d. The best question she thinks she ever asked was 11 words long, to David Cameron: \u201cDoes the prime minister support the closure of local police stations?\u201d</p> <p>The British remain squeamish about cameras entering other public spaces, courtrooms in particular. Yet this too is now being trialled. The direction of travel was set, 30 years ago this month. But as the boundaries continue to blur between real and manufactured, truth and lies \u2013 as a reality TV star prepares to fight for a second term in the White House, having instigated a new culture of constant campaigning that is taking root here \u2013 our anxieties over politics as exciting television persist. We celebrate what has been gained, but fret over what we may have lost.</p> <h2>Cameras in the Chamber: a history in 10 scenes</h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2015/oct/10/geoffrey-howe-resignation-speech-margaret-thatcher-downfall-video\" title=\"\">1.

The camera cut from the quiet assassin on the backbenches to the stony-faced Thatcher listening upfront, staring forward, trapped in the frame and possibly cursing the decision to let the cameras roll a year before. Howe joked about her cabinet being a cricket team whose \u201cbats have been broken before the game by the team captain\u201d; the laughter that followed echoes down the ages to all restless leaders looking over their shoulders. </p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw4JB25nr0s\" title=\"\">2. \u2018I\u2019m enjoying this!\u2019, 22 November 1990</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f82e568f682c94216a458b790d4ed6cbb892a9a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f82e568f682c94216a458b790d4ed6cbb892a9a4/0_51_1261_830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher \u2018 I\u2019m Enjoying This \u2018 moment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Margaret Thatcher reclaimed the spotlight on the day of her resignation, refusing to be cowed by the Commons. \u201cHer performance was as tough and uncompromising as ever,\u201d came the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im9c1JHtrI0\" title=\"\">Paxman review</a> that night. There are some classic, quotable lines for sure, such as her attack on the Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes. \u201cHe would rather the poor were poorer, provided the rich were not richer,\u201d said Thatcher, mockingly demonstrating her view of socialist economics with her fingers to the delight of loyalists behind. Then came a classic quip from Dennis Skinner. In response to the question of whether Thatcher would continue her fight against a central European bank, the Beast of Bolsover volunteered from his sedentary position: \u201cNo, she\u2019s gonna be the governor\u201d. Cue a roar of laughter, unusual for coming from all sides \u2013 including the Iron Lady, who had been crying only hours before. \u201cWhat a good idea!\u201d she cried, giving a swing of her fist.It was such a bravura swansong that the party may have already begun to regret getting rid of her. And she knew it. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying this,\u201d she trumpeted with a smile.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?56817-1/john-smith-memorium\" title=\"\">3.

      "bodyText": "When Ian Gow, the member for Eastbourne, rose to his feet on 21 November 1989 to make the first televised speech in our most ancient of parliaments, it is fair to say he wasn\u2019t too happy about it. \u201cI have always voted against the televising of the proceedings of this House,\u201d said the Tory MP, and he was not alone. His ire stemmed partly from a letter that had been circulated to MPs three weeks earlier, confirming in his mind the cynical and unseemly nature of the whole ghastly endeavour. \u201cThe impression you make on television,\u201d Gow recounted from the advice contained in the memo, \u201cdepends mainly on your image (55%), with your voice and body language accounting for 38% of your impact. Only 7% depends on what you are actually saying.\u201d The guidance to camera-shy members went on to say: \u201cWe can guarantee to improve your appearance through a personal and confidential image consultation. You will learn if you need a new hairstyle \u2013 and where to get it \u2013 and the type of glasses to suit your face.\u201d Gow considered himself \u201cbeyond redemption on both counts\u201d. Neil Kinnock sympathised, recalling that before he made his entrance on to what was now essentially a TV set, he had been handed a \u201cpapier poudr\u00e9, which looks to me like cerebral blotting papers which apparently are for mopping one\u2019s head\u201d. Self-deprecation aside, much of the dialogue came from MPs wearily accepting something that had divided Westminster, and been delayed by its members, for decades: the inevitability of the mass media age. Not only on the issue of picking your best side for the camera, but over deep philosophical anxieties about the nature of democracy, and the very soul of a democratic chamber itself. Today, as we approach the 30th anniversary of that first televised session, it is hard for most of us to imagine what the fuss was about \u2013 not least a younger generation so used to capturing and sharing almost anything and everything as part of daily life. This is especially true of the withdrawal agreement, a year-long soap opera that has seen live parliamentary coverage cross over from niche geek activity to mainstream spectator sport. John Bercow, until recently Speaker of the House, is now a star on the continent, where an app can imitate him saying: \u201cUuuuhhhder\u201d, and BBC Parliament even enjoyed a ratings spike that briefly took it above MTV. It would be hard for any democrat to argue today that a citizen has no right to see inside. John Reith first pushed the idea of parliamentary broadcasting as far back as the 1920s, but it was never given serious consideration until Harold Wilson arrived in No 10 for his \u201cwhite heat of technology\u201d revolution. What precipitated the unthinkable? The 1960s had brought a sharp rise in TV interviews and panel debates between politicians, and there was a rising sense that the \u201csupreme forum\u201d of national debate was being substituted for something baser. So in May 1965, the member for Ilford (the appropriately named Mr TL Iremonger), begged to move that \u201cthe maximum involvement of a responsible people in the processes of parliamentary government is a sure guarantee of liberty\u201d, and it was time to directly enter people\u2019s homes. But a select committee investigation and test screenings brought unfavourable feedback, and members voted against. As they again did in 1972. And 1975. It took more than 22 years and 11 debates before a sea-change occurred \u2013 in that bastion of forward-looking modernity, the House of Lords. A sort of \u201cout of town tryout\u201d was initiated in \u201cthe other place\u201d by Christopher Soames \u2013 leader of the Lords and son-in-law of the orator-in-chief, Winston Churchill \u2013 in December 1983. They tested it in January 1985, when Harold Macmillan \u2013 whose own premiership had been destined to end when he was mocked in a theatre by Peter Cook and the rest of Beyond the Fringe \u2013 stole the show. The Commons, whose inhabitants would be elected by those watching, after all, had many concerns. Who was going to edit the coverage? Would exhibitionists get to hog the mike? Would it change the character of the house, turning politics into mere performance \u2013 the substance, the nuance gone? But the die seemed cast by 1989, when the leader of the House reported back from the select committee with reassurances: \u201cEight remote-controlled cameras will be mounted just under the galleries and will be as unobtrusive as we can make them. We went into lighting with some care, as many honourable members feel passionately about the subject.\u201d Only a standard head-and-shoulders shot would be permitted. There would be limited use of wide-angle shots, a limit on the use of reaction shots, and a prohibition on the use of split-screen. No panning, just straight cuts. All in the interests of fair coverage and balance. It didn\u2019t take long for the pressures of \u201cgood drama\u201d to intervene. Only weeks after opening night on 21 November, the restriction on reaction shots was relaxed. Today, the controller of BBC Parliament, Peter Knowles, tells me that the intention is to \u201cmake you feel like you are part of the event. We see members who are actively taking part in the debate \u2013 not just when they are speaking \u2013 and in the floor-level shots you see the chamber much as the Speaker sees it, which gives some thrilling moments of drama. \u201cThere\u2019s suddenly \u2013 and perhaps surprisingly \u2013 a big appetite for the authenticity and rawness.\u201d And it is thrilling. At least, I think so. I began watching footage of the House on the evening news as a boy in the early 90s, as the industries in my Nottinghamshire village began to disappear as a consequence of the discussions and the votes taking place on the TV. Getting to know the faces, learning the names. It\u2019s a fascination that fed into the writing of my play This House for the National Theatre in 2012, about the high drama of the 1974 hung parliament. So, have the old anxieties passed about turning the chamber into a variety hall and politics into mere performance \u2013 about parliament becoming a place where the best actors triumph over the best minds, with elected representatives in the chamber not so much speaking to each other as simply broadcasting to those outside? The motivation for Boris Johnson\u2019s war against parliament was the message being sent out to his leave base \u2013 he had little time for winning around the people sitting opposite him. And Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s final question in PMQs is no question at all, but clippable content to share among the Momentum network. My own local MP, Gloria De Piero, retiring this year and a former TV news star herself, champions the way the cameras force you to think of your constituents watching at home. When getting to her feet, she says: \u201cI am totally thinking about my constituents, and bringing their voice to parliament.\u201d She doesn\u2019t judge those who use the stage to grandstand and wax lyrical, \u201cbut I just can\u2019t think of the job like that\u201d. The best question she thinks she ever asked was 11 words long, to David Cameron: \u201cDoes the prime minister support the closure of local police stations?\u201d The British remain squeamish about cameras entering other public spaces, courtrooms in particular. Yet this too is now being trialled. The direction of travel was set, 30 years ago this month. But as the boundaries continue to blur between real and manufactured, truth and lies \u2013 as a reality TV star prepares to fight for a second term in the White House, having instigated a new culture of constant campaigning that is taking root here \u2013 our anxieties over politics as exciting television persist. We celebrate what has been gained, but fret over what we may have lost. Cameras in the Chamber: a history in 10 scenes 1. Geoffrey Howe resigns, 13 November 1990 Iconic for what it captured on camera as well as the events it precipitated off (the Iron Lady would be out two weeks later). The camera cut from the quiet assassin on the backbenches to the stony-faced Thatcher listening upfront, staring forward, trapped in the frame and possibly cursing the decision to let the cameras roll a year before. Howe joked about her cabinet being a cricket team whose \u201cbats have been broken before the game by the team captain\u201d; the laughter that followed echoes down the ages to all restless leaders looking over their shoulders. 2. \u2018I\u2019m enjoying this!\u2019, 22 November 1990 Margaret Thatcher reclaimed the spotlight on the day of her resignation, refusing to be cowed by the Commons. \u201cHer performance was as tough and uncompromising as ever,\u201d came the Paxman review that night. There are some classic, quotable lines for sure, such as her attack on the Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes. \u201cHe would rather the poor were poorer, provided the rich were not richer,\u201d said Thatcher, mockingly demonstrating her view of socialist economics with her fingers to the delight of loyalists behind. Then came a classic quip from Dennis Skinner. In response to the question of whether Thatcher would continue her fight against a central European bank, the Beast of Bolsover volunteered from his sedentary position: \u201cNo, she\u2019s gonna be the governor\u201d. Cue a roar of laughter, unusual for coming from all sides \u2013 including the Iron Lady, who had been crying only hours before. \u201cWhat a good idea!\u201d she cried, giving a swing of her fist.It was such a bravura swansong that the party may have already begun to regret getting rid of her. And she knew it. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying this,\u201d she trumpeted with a smile. 3. The death of John Smith, 12 May 1994 It\u2019s often the more sombre sessions that bring out the best behaviour. John Major should have been facing John Smith at the dispatch box that day, but the Commons instead met together in grief. \u201cWhen I think of John Smith, I think of an opponent, not an enemy,\u201d said Major. Despite her clear grief, Margaret Beckett \u2013 who as deputy leader took the place of her friend \u2013 was impossibly dignified as she informed the House of the closing words of a speech Smith had given the night before: \u201c\u2018The opportunity to serve our country. That is all we ask.\u2019 Let it stand as his epitaph.\u201d 4. Robin Cook resigns, 17 March 2003 There were many turbulent and emotional scenes in the lead-up to the Iraq invasion in 2003; the resignation of the respected former foreign secretary, who could not support the war, was one. \u201cHistory will be astonished,\u201d he rightly predicted. Note that man to the left of the frame, sitting behind him \u2013 a future Labour leader and key player in the Stop the War coalition. 5. Purple rain, 19 May 2004 One of the more surreal moments, as a screaming Fathers4Justice campaigner in the public gallery launched a flour bomb at Tony Blair, which connected with his shoulder and burst into a purple puff. No one knew what the concoction was, so the session was suspended immediately. A Perspex barrier has sealed off the gallery from the chamber ever since. 6. \u2018That is that. The end\u2019, 27 June 2007 Tony Blair ended his tenure with a quieter turn than Thatcher, paying tribute to the House despite admitting he was not exactly a \u201cCommons man\u201d. Politics, he said to the occasional swallow, was the arena that set the heart beating a little faster, a place for noble causes. \u201cI wish everyone, friend or foe, well. And that is that. The end.\u201d A highly unusual (and technically forbidden) standing ovation from the entire chamber followed. 7. Tributes to Jo Cox, 20 June 2016 As with the death of John Smith, this was an occasion everyone would sooner had never taken place. But it was also, once again, a deeply moving national moment that showed the House at its humane best, and a testament to a clearly loved colleague. The white rose of Yorkshire was worn by every member and also occupied the seat \u2013 alongside a red rose \u2013 where Cox should have been, as her friends repeated the sentiment now familiar (though still too frequently ignored) from her maiden speech: \u201cWe have more in common than that which divides us.\u201d 8. May government found in contempt, 4 December 2018 The Netflix-style saga around the withdrawal agreement\u2019s traumatic passage through parliament has too many episodes from which to choose, from the points-of-order attacks against the Speaker for selecting the Grieve amendment, to Labour members trying to prevent the proroguing of parliament, to the final fall of May. But this is where it began: a government voted 311 to 293 to be found in contempt of parliament for the first time in history. One member is heard to call out \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d. Talk about spoilers. 9. Rosie Duffield recounts her abuse, 2 October 2019 There is no better recent example of MPs reminding us they are real people, with real lives, than Rosie Duffield\u2019s brave and precise account of the ways, big and small, that abusers can trap those that they abuse. She makes it all the way to the end before allowing her grief to flow out, to be immediately swamped with hands by her colleagues and friends. 10. Saturday matinee, 19 October 2019 The first televised weekend fixture in the House\u2019s history. It must have been serious. Kick-off was 9.30am and the big vote to delay a vote on Johnson\u2019s deal was passed around 3pm. It didn\u2019t have the fireworks or the memorable lines of other Brexit sittings \u2013 in fact, everyone was trying to be very collegiate and statesperson-like. How much of that had to do with the cold light of a Saturday? Or was it a greater understanding of the little lenses fixed menacingly around the chamber, as they have been now for three decades, the knowledge of a captivated world watching?",

      "body": "<p>One shopper has come from Denmark and spent over \u00a31,000. Grans, mums and schoolmates are all filling baskets with T-shirts, sequinned trousers and pyjamas. This is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/primark\" title=\"\">Primark</a>, the cut-price fashion chain that has grown from one shop in Dublin in 1969 to become the UK\u2019s biggest seller of clothing, offering everything from pants and socks to headphones and party dresses.</p> <p>It already sells more items of clothing than any other retailer, and this year it is expected to overtake Marks &amp; Spencer to become the biggest clothing retailer by value, too. While M&amp;S is rapidly losing sales and closing shops, Primark is expected to account for \u00a31 out of every \u00a314 spent on clothing in the UK this year, according to market analysts GlobalData.</p> <p>Primark opened four new UK stores this year, including its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/11/world-biggest-primark-store-opens-in-birmingham\" title=\"\">biggest yet</a>, a 14,800 sq metre giant in Birmingham. These five floors of fashion, a Disney cafe and Harry Potter shop have become a coach-trip destination akin to the Blackpool illuminations \u2013 and can even pull in shoppers from abroad, like the Danish woman who makes an annual pilgrimage especially to shop at Primark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5672c09e98fac5d6114a0b0d648bfcb1dd801df5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5672c09e98fac5d6114a0b0d648bfcb1dd801df5/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Primark Disney Cafe at the Birmingham shop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Primark Disney Cafe at the Birmingham shop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it is doing all this during a dire year for the British high street, in which a string of names have gone bust, including Karen Millen, Bonmarch\u00e9, Jack Wills and LK Bennett. House of Fraser and Debenhams are both expected to close numerous stores as their owners struggle to stay afloat, and last week the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/05/mothercare-to-cease-all-uk-trading-with-loss-of-2800-jobs\" title=\"\">UK business of Mothercare collapsed into administration</a>.</p> <p>Sales at Primark\u2019s established stores slipped by 1% in the year to 14 September, but that looks insignificant compared with diving sales elsewhere, including a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/06/marks-and-spencer-profits-plunge-clothing-sales-fall\" title=\"\">5.5% fall in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/06/marks-and-spencer-profits-plunge-clothing-sales-fall\" title=\"\">like-for-like sales</a> revealed last week by Marks &amp; Spencer.</p> <p>Many high street retailers blame their woes on the rise of the internet, but Primark is thriving without an online store or home deliveries. It plans to open 19 more stores in the UK and Europe in the next 12 months, including one in a former Bhs at Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre. It is also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/05/primark-ramps-up-us-ambitions-sales-defy-high-street-gloom\" title=\"\">stepping up expansion in the US</a>, partly making use of space abandoned by failed department stores such as Sears.</p> <p>Low prices seem to be a key part of the magic. At the Birmingham store, it is possible to buy a bra for less than \u00a32, kids\u2019 Christmas pyjamas for \u00a35 and a multitude of dresses for \u00a310. That compares with a minimum of \u00a38 each for a two-pack of bras at M&amp;S and or \u00a35 each in a two-pack at Debenhams.</p> <p>Shoppers cite low prices as the biggest draw. \u201cMy kids call me Primark Queen,\u201d says Jane Biddle, 44, standing outside the store surrounded by brown paper bags of tops, dressing gowns and other Christmassy items after spending two hours in the store. \u201cIt\u2019s all in there: they\u2019ve got what you want,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can save quite a lot of money but you could spend a bomb because the value is so good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"799854779bf4e74377763032e2deb0f0495f4249\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/799854779bf4e74377763032e2deb0f0495f4249/0_210_4180_2508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"YouTuber Saffron Barker, pictured with fans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">YouTuber Saffron Barker, pictured with fans, has had exclusive collections at Primark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lucy Farrington, 19, and her sister Olivia \u2013 out shopping with their mum and dad \u2013 say they\u2019re fans of young fashion websites such as Pretty Little Thing, Missguided and Asos, but like Primark \u201cbecause it is cheap and convenient. Everything is in there, from clothes to chargers and makeup.\u201d</p> <p>Restricting itself to a relatively small number of stores \u2013 189 in the UK compared with about 300 clothing outlets for Marks &amp; Spencer and more than 400 for New Look \u2013 helps Primark operate more efficiently and keep prices low.</p> <p>James Clark, a lecturer at the London College of Fashion, says the combination of relatively large, well-appointed shops and low prices also means it becomes a go-to destination in each local area. The more recent additions of cafes, nail bars and hair salons also help it stand out.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a category killer approach,\u201d says Clark. \u201cThey dominate a local market, while the likes of M&amp;S or Next are just one of a number of similar stores.\u201d</p> <p>John Bason, finance director of Primark\u2019s parent group, Associated British Foods \u2013 which is controlled by the billionaire Weston family \u2013 says selling online would only add costs and undermine the low prices.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much cost is added by picking and individually packing those items [to sell online],\u201d he says. \u201cIf you are talking about the essentials [such as underwear or T-shirts] we have a very, very efficient way of getting it to the customer.\u201d</p> <p>Primark also spurns traditional advertising, instead using social media to connect with young shoppers and entice them into stores.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Primark hopes to avoid M&S's fate \u2013 alienating young people who don't want to shop where their grandparents did \u2013 by keeping on top of new trends</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The brand has 20 million followers on sites such as Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest, up from 13 million last year. Primark creates a buzz through links with influencers and celebrities and via the Primania social site, where fans post pictures of themselves in Primark outfits \u2013 often with the price tag attached.</p> <p>It also taps into online trends with the shopping equivalent of clickbait. This week, the Birmingham store showcased cheap gifts linked to Disney\u2019s <em>Frozen</em> franchise, PlayStation and <em>Call of Duty,</em> as well as Funko collectible dolls.</p> <p>Bason credits Primark boss Paul Marchant, a former New Look executive who took the helm in 2009, for its continuing growth.</p> <p>\u201cAmazing prices is where it all started, but the thing that propelled us is the magic of Paul Marchant and what he has done with fashionability, constant surprise and newness,\u201d he says. \u201cAbout 50% of what we sell is basics, but there is a lot of new stuff and fun things coming into stores all the time.\u201d</p> <p>He says keeping on top of trends will help save Primark from M&amp;S\u2019s fate: going from being the family favourite to alienating younger shoppers who didn\u2019t want to shop where their grandparents did.</p> <p>If there is one problem on the horizon, it is the threat of a backlash against its cut-price model, which seems out of tune with the youth environmental movement fronted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a>.</p> <p>The chain\u2019s fast fashions have been criticised for fuelling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/nov/27/mps-criticise-high-street-fashion-throwaway-culture\" title=\"\">unsustainable throwaway culture</a> as well as low wages at its overseas suppliers.</p> <p>Chloe Collins, analyst at GlobalData, thinks this could become a problem for Primark: \u201cFast fashion has been a big thing but people are becoming more aware of sustainability.\u201d</p> <p>Primark is responding with a sustainable cotton initiative, training more than 160,000 independent farmers to use less pesticide, fertiliser and water. It says it has already sold 14 million pairs of pyjamas, 3 million pairs of jeans and 6 million duvet covers and towels made with this cotton. It is also testing out recycled polyester fabric and a clothing recycling scheme that could be extended across the chain next year.</p> <p>Bason says Primark is now seen as a leader on ethical sourcing, after it dramatically increased its global factory monitoring teams. This was in response to a 2009 scandal over underpaid factory workers at one supplier in the UK and the 2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rana-plaza\" title=\"\">Rana Plaza disaster</a> in Bangladesh, where more than 1,000 people died at a factory complex making clothes for Primark and a number of other brands.</p> <p>Aside from efficient systems and avoiding home delivery, Bason insists that Primark\u2019s low prices are the result of volume discounts from suppliers, and lower profit margins on each item. \u201cOur suppliers sell to all the major brands on the high street,\u201d he says, \u201cand I know the price we buy at is not that different.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87ba0828f0c9b6c0b72f604344eeaea53ea4c0ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87ba0828f0c9b6c0b72f604344eeaea53ea4c0ef/0_7_3723_2234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A memorial to those who died in the Rana Plaza collapse on the outskirts of Dhaka, Bangladesh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A memorial to those who died in the Rana Plaza collapse on the outskirts of Dhaka, Bangladesh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2008, the group had only a handful of people overseeing conditions at the factories it uses \u2013 now it has more than 100. Dominique Muller of campaign group Labour Behind the Label says: \u201cPrimark is now much more rigorous in terms of knowing and monitoring its supply chain.\u201d She says it also publishes a list of its \u201ctier one\u201d clothing manufacturers \u2013 in line with best practice in the industry \u2013 so campaigners can monitor conditions at its factories.</p> <p>Clark, however, says Primark needs to build sustainability into the whole business, not just a few pairs of sustainable jeans, if it is to satisfy young people\u2019s growing interest in ethical issues: \u201cMore and more people are becoming socially aware. That poses questions for the future.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "One shopper has come from Denmark and spent over \u00a31,000. Grans, mums and schoolmates are all filling baskets with T-shirts, sequinned trousers and pyjamas. This is Primark, the cut-price fashion chain that has grown from one shop in Dublin in 1969 to become the UK\u2019s biggest seller of clothing, offering everything from pants and socks to headphones and party dresses. It already sells more items of clothing than any other retailer, and this year it is expected to overtake Marks &amp; Spencer to become the biggest clothing retailer by value, too. While M&amp;S is rapidly losing sales and closing shops, Primark is expected to account for \u00a31 out of every \u00a314 spent on clothing in the UK this year, according to market analysts GlobalData. Primark opened four new UK stores this year, including its biggest yet, a 14,800 sq metre giant in Birmingham. These five floors of fashion, a Disney cafe and Harry Potter shop have become a coach-trip destination akin to the Blackpool illuminations \u2013 and can even pull in shoppers from abroad, like the Danish woman who makes an annual pilgrimage especially to shop at Primark. And it is doing all this during a dire year for the British high street, in which a string of names have gone bust, including Karen Millen, Bonmarch\u00e9, Jack Wills and LK Bennett. House of Fraser and Debenhams are both expected to close numerous stores as their owners struggle to stay afloat, and last week the UK business of Mothercare collapsed into administration. Sales at Primark\u2019s established stores slipped by 1% in the year to 14 September, but that looks insignificant compared with diving sales elsewhere, including a 5.5% fall in like-for-like sales revealed last week by Marks &amp; Spencer. Many high street retailers blame their woes on the rise of the internet, but Primark is thriving without an online store or home deliveries. It plans to open 19 more stores in the UK and Europe in the next 12 months, including one in a former Bhs at Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre. It is also stepping up expansion in the US, partly making use of space abandoned by failed department stores such as Sears. Low prices seem to be a key part of the magic. At the Birmingham store, it is possible to buy a bra for less than \u00a32, kids\u2019 Christmas pyjamas for \u00a35 and a multitude of dresses for \u00a310. That compares with a minimum of \u00a38 each for a two-pack of bras at M&amp;S and or \u00a35 each in a two-pack at Debenhams. Shoppers cite low prices as the biggest draw. \u201cMy kids call me Primark Queen,\u201d says Jane Biddle, 44, standing outside the store surrounded by brown paper bags of tops, dressing gowns and other Christmassy items after spending two hours in the store. \u201cIt\u2019s all in there: they\u2019ve got what you want,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can save quite a lot of money but you could spend a bomb because the value is so good.\u201d Lucy Farrington, 19, and her sister Olivia \u2013 out shopping with their mum and dad \u2013 say they\u2019re fans of young fashion websites such as Pretty Little Thing, Missguided and Asos, but like Primark \u201cbecause it is cheap and convenient. Everything is in there, from clothes to chargers and makeup.\u201d Restricting itself to a relatively small number of stores \u2013 189 in the UK compared with about 300 clothing outlets for Marks &amp; Spencer and more than 400 for New Look \u2013 helps Primark operate more efficiently and keep prices low. James Clark, a lecturer at the London College of Fashion, says the combination of relatively large, well-appointed shops and low prices also means it becomes a go-to destination in each local area. The more recent additions of cafes, nail bars and hair salons also help it stand out. \u201cIt\u2019s a category killer approach,\u201d says Clark. \u201cThey dominate a local market, while the likes of M&amp;S or Next are just one of a number of similar stores.\u201d John Bason, finance director of Primark\u2019s parent group, Associated British Foods \u2013 which is controlled by the billionaire Weston family \u2013 says selling online would only add costs and undermine the low prices. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much cost is added by picking and individually packing those items [to sell online],\u201d he says. \u201cIf you are talking about the essentials [such as underwear or T-shirts] we have a very, very efficient way of getting it to the customer.\u201d Primark also spurns traditional advertising, instead using social media to connect with young shoppers and entice them into stores. The brand has 20 million followers on sites such as Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest, up from 13 million last year. Primark creates a buzz through links with influencers and celebrities and via the Primania social site, where fans post pictures of themselves in Primark outfits \u2013 often with the price tag attached. It also taps into online trends with the shopping equivalent of clickbait. This week, the Birmingham store showcased cheap gifts linked to Disney\u2019s Frozen franchise, PlayStation and Call of Duty, as well as Funko collectible dolls. Bason credits Primark boss Paul Marchant, a former New Look executive who took the helm in 2009, for its continuing growth. \u201cAmazing prices is where it all started, but the thing that propelled us is the magic of Paul Marchant and what he has done with fashionability, constant surprise and newness,\u201d he says. \u201cAbout 50% of what we sell is basics, but there is a lot of new stuff and fun things coming into stores all the time.\u201d He says keeping on top of trends will help save Primark from M&amp;S\u2019s fate: going from being the family favourite to alienating younger shoppers who didn\u2019t want to shop where their grandparents did. If there is one problem on the horizon, it is the threat of a backlash against its cut-price model, which seems out of tune with the youth environmental movement fronted by Greta Thunberg. The chain\u2019s fast fashions have been criticised for fuelling unsustainable throwaway culture as well as low wages at its overseas suppliers. Chloe Collins, analyst at GlobalData, thinks this could become a problem for Primark: \u201cFast fashion has been a big thing but people are becoming more aware of sustainability.\u201d Primark is responding with a sustainable cotton initiative, training more than 160,000 independent farmers to use less pesticide, fertiliser and water. It says it has already sold 14 million pairs of pyjamas, 3 million pairs of jeans and 6 million duvet covers and towels made with this cotton. It is also testing out recycled polyester fabric and a clothing recycling scheme that could be extended across the chain next year. Bason says Primark is now seen as a leader on ethical sourcing, after it dramatically increased its global factory monitoring teams. This was in response to a 2009 scandal over underpaid factory workers at one supplier in the UK and the 2013 Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh, where more than 1,000 people died at a factory complex making clothes for Primark and a number of other brands. Aside from efficient systems and avoiding home delivery, Bason insists that Primark\u2019s low prices are the result of volume discounts from suppliers, and lower profit margins on each item. \u201cOur suppliers sell to all the major brands on the high street,\u201d he says, \u201cand I know the price we buy at is not that different.\u201d In 2008, the group had only a handful of people overseeing conditions at the factories it uses \u2013 now it has more than 100. Dominique Muller of campaign group Labour Behind the Label says: \u201cPrimark is now much more rigorous in terms of knowing and monitoring its supply chain.\u201d She says it also publishes a list of its \u201ctier one\u201d clothing manufacturers \u2013 in line with best practice in the industry \u2013 so campaigners can monitor conditions at its factories. Clark, however, says Primark needs to build sustainability into the whole business, not just a few pairs of sustainable jeans, if it is to satisfy young people\u2019s growing interest in ethical issues: \u201cMore and more people are becoming socially aware. That poses questions for the future.\u201d",

Over in nearby Vomero, which also features in the book, people have a strong suspicion that the writer lives in the neighbourhood and that she may have even signed up as a member of IoCiSto, a bookshop owned by citizens and run by volunteers. \u201cDuring the first year after we opened, a woman came in and asked lots of questions about the shop and the story behind it,\u201d said Alberto Della Sala, the bookshop\u2019s director. \u201cWe believe that it was her.\u201d A corner of IoCiSto is dedicated to Ferrante, and about three dozen copies of La Vita Bugiarda Degli Adulti have sold since Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot for us and for a book launched midweek,\u201d adds Sala. \u201cWe expect more in the Christmas lead-up. I\u2019ve only read the first few pages, but it is beautiful.\u201d Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels, which told the story of the lifelong friendship and rivalry between two women, sold more than 10m copies around the world, 1.5m in Italy. My Brilliant Friend\u2019s adaptation into a TV series was also a huge success, and a second season covering the second novel is expected to be aired next year. Ferrante\u2019s first five books, beginning with Troubling Love in 1992, attracted a cult following in Italy, but, paradoxically, the author only really started to capture Italian readers after the success of My Brilliant Friend abroad. \u201cI was only encouraged to read it after hearing about it from foreign friends,\u201d said Francesca Iarusso, a PhD student in Naples. \u201cThen I became fascinated. I liked the books because they were very feminine in regards sentiments that aren\u2019t so easily expressed by other authors. As for Ferrante\u2019s identity, I don\u2019t care.\u201d Maurizio Pagano, an author who grew up in Rione Luzzatti, said: \u201cUnfortunately, Italy is a country that doesn\u2019t read much, so Ferrante hasn\u2019t had the same prominence here as she has had abroad.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I remember there was an aquarium in the hospice where my cousin Billie spent the last few weeks of her life. Luis, her son, liked going to visit her there more than to the hospital, not realising what her move to a palliative care centre really meant. He liked watching the big guppy in the fish tank kiss the glass when he pressed his face up against it. He\u2019d kick a football down the corridors; seven years old and often straight from school in his too-big uniform, polished black shoes loudly slapping the lino as he ran to her room.</p> <p>I call Luis my nephew because Billie was always more of a sister to me. Throughout her six-year illness \u2013 she was diagnosed with a brain tumour at 26 and died at 31 \u2013 I helped look after Luis. He was just two when Billie had the first operation and although she did her best to carry on as a young working mother (she was a really in-demand makeup artist), I know she appreciated that family and friends babysat when we could.</p> <p>One evening, not long after that life-changing diagnosis, I went over to Billie\u2019s small flat in west London, which she shared with Luis and her best friend, Hannah. I had a cheap bottle of wine with me and was ready to ask her all about how she was coping after the first round of radiotherapy. But she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. She asked me questions about my life \u2013 I\u2019d just graduated and was a few months into my first job. We poured big glasses of the wine \u2013 she never paid much attention to doctors\u2019 suggestions that she should quit drinking \u2013 and laughed so loudly we forgot that Luis was asleep.</p> <p>It was inconceivable to me then that she wouldn\u2019t survive, but as I tiptoed past Luis\u2019s room, his name spelt out in wooden letters on the door, I had a crushing flash-forward: what if she didn\u2019t?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His boyish and surreal chat helped me deal with my own grief</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ll always look out for him you know,\u201d I said without planning to. \u201cLike, whatever happens, I\u2019ll always make sure he\u2019s OK. I promise.\u201d Billie brushed this off, changed the subject, hit play on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3ov9USxVxY\" title=\"\">Madonna\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3ov9USxVxY\" title=\"\">Ray of Light</a>.</em> But I\u2019d made a promise I meant to keep.</p> <p>Today, Luis is 16. He\u2019s studying at the same sixth-form college his mother went to. He lives with his grandmother. His room used to be Billie\u2019s childhood room. But it\u2019s painted blue now.</p> <p>We hang out a couple of times a month and he insists I stick his left AirPod in my ear so he can play me \u201chis music\u201d \u2013 London drill and rap \u2013 and translate the lyrics: \u201cSo basically a trap house is where you sell drugs.\u201d Yes, I know that one, I\u2019ve watched <em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80217669\" title=\"\">Top Boy</a></em>. \u201cA Glock is a gun.\u201d Yes, I know. \u201cAll right then, what\u2019s OT?\u201d I rack the somewhat patchy urban dictionary in my brain. OK Luis, you\u2019ve got me there. He\u2019ll explain it means out of town. Which sounds innocent enough, but given the context probably isn\u2019t. I\u2019ll ask in a slightly panicked but non-judgmental tone if the life described in these songs is relatable to him. \u201cNaaaaaah. That\u2019s not for me,\u201d he\u2019ll say, cringing slightly, and I believe him.</p> <p>I understand why the raw desperation and anger of that music appeals to Luis. He\u2019s not endured the same endemic hardships that artists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/01/grime-afro-bashment-drill-how-black-british-music-became-more-fertile-than-ever\" title=\"\">Loski</a> describes in his controversial tracks, but he knows pain and he knows injustice. He lost his mum before he finished primary school. He only sees his dad occasionally, as he lives out of London \u2013 Billie and he had split up soon after Luis was born.</p> <p>\u201cAll I feel is anger,\u201d he told me over a Nando\u2019s recently. \u201cI\u2019m not like other people. I just honestly don\u2019t feel anything except anger.

He knows what\u2019s what and goes to the right chicken shops with the right people, but he also lives with his 64-year-old grandma and is surrounded by a close family of arty, middle-class women: my mother, my other cousin Romy, and his godmother Hannah. He\u2019s forever walking into the living room to find us all gabbing about <em>Strictly</em>, listening to the Rolling Stones and dancing embarrassingly after drinking too much prosecco. I\u2019m confident his ability to shift between worlds and hold his own with boys on street corners and tipsy older ladies in Cos dresses and statement necklaces will stand him in good stead for life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018I don\u2019t feel anything except anger,\u2019 Luis said. \u2018I\u00a0never cry\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After the funeral I made regular plans to take Luis out. We did physical things together: I\u2019d set him obstacle courses, we\u2019d race between trees in the park, we went to climbing centres, trampolining, and crazy golf.

These things made me feel better too.</p> <p>Playing with Luis between the ages of seven and 12, and getting drawn into his epic imaginary worlds and silly, surreal, schoolboy conversations helped me deal with my grief. He was so full of life, just like Billie, and being with him always lifted my spirits. He\u2019d mention Billie anecdotally \u2013 \u201cOh yeah, I went there with my mum\u201d \u2013 as if she was still alive.

He screwed up the paper and threw it at me. \u201cI\u2019m angry she died too,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I love you and nothing you ever say or do will change that.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, we went as a family to a music festival in London to watch Romy perform with her band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-xx\" title=\"\">The xx</a>.

      "bodyText": "I remember there was an aquarium in the hospice where my cousin Billie spent the last few weeks of her life. Luis, her son, liked going to visit her there more than to the hospital, not realising what her move to a palliative care centre really meant. He liked watching the big guppy in the fish tank kiss the glass when he pressed his face up against it. He\u2019d kick a football down the corridors; seven years old and often straight from school in his too-big uniform, polished black shoes loudly slapping the lino as he ran to her room. I call Luis my nephew because Billie was always more of a sister to me. Throughout her six-year illness \u2013 she was diagnosed with a brain tumour at 26 and died at 31 \u2013 I helped look after Luis. He was just two when Billie had the first operation and although she did her best to carry on as a young working mother (she was a really in-demand makeup artist), I know she appreciated that family and friends babysat when we could. One evening, not long after that life-changing diagnosis, I went over to Billie\u2019s small flat in west London, which she shared with Luis and her best friend, Hannah. I had a cheap bottle of wine with me and was ready to ask her all about how she was coping after the first round of radiotherapy. But she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. She asked me questions about my life \u2013 I\u2019d just graduated and was a few months into my first job. We poured big glasses of the wine \u2013 she never paid much attention to doctors\u2019 suggestions that she should quit drinking \u2013 and laughed so loudly we forgot that Luis was asleep. It was inconceivable to me then that she wouldn\u2019t survive, but as I tiptoed past Luis\u2019s room, his name spelt out in wooden letters on the door, I had a crushing flash-forward: what if she didn\u2019t? \u201cI\u2019ll always look out for him you know,\u201d I said without planning to. \u201cLike, whatever happens, I\u2019ll always make sure he\u2019s OK. I promise.\u201d Billie brushed this off, changed the subject, hit play on Madonna\u2019s Ray of Light. But I\u2019d made a promise I meant to keep. Today, Luis is 16. He\u2019s studying at the same sixth-form college his mother went to. He lives with his grandmother. His room used to be Billie\u2019s childhood room. But it\u2019s painted blue now. We hang out a couple of times a month and he insists I stick his left AirPod in my ear so he can play me \u201chis music\u201d \u2013 London drill and rap \u2013 and translate the lyrics: \u201cSo basically a trap house is where you sell drugs.\u201d Yes, I know that one, I\u2019ve watched Top Boy. \u201cA Glock is a gun.\u201d Yes, I know. \u201cAll right then, what\u2019s OT?\u201d I rack the somewhat patchy urban dictionary in my brain. OK Luis, you\u2019ve got me there. He\u2019ll explain it means out of town. Which sounds innocent enough, but given the context probably isn\u2019t. I\u2019ll ask in a slightly panicked but non-judgmental tone if the life described in these songs is relatable to him. \u201cNaaaaaah. That\u2019s not for me,\u201d he\u2019ll say, cringing slightly, and I believe him. I understand why the raw desperation and anger of that music appeals to Luis. He\u2019s not endured the same endemic hardships that artists such as Loski describes in his controversial tracks, but he knows pain and he knows injustice. He lost his mum before he finished primary school. He only sees his dad occasionally, as he lives out of London \u2013 Billie and he had split up soon after Luis was born. \u201cAll I feel is anger,\u201d he told me over a Nando\u2019s recently. \u201cI\u2019m not like other people. I just honestly don\u2019t feel anything except anger. I never cry.\u201d It was one of those conversations that came out of nowhere, and I\u2019m not sure I said the right thing back, but I listened and reminded him he could always talk to me, and by the time he finished his burger he was telling me in great detail about some rapper who\u2019d just got out of prison as if the previous conversation had never happened. Growing up in west London, Luis is on the edge of \u201cstreet\u201d culture. He knows what\u2019s what and goes to the right chicken shops with the right people, but he also lives with his 64-year-old grandma and is surrounded by a close family of arty, middle-class women: my mother, my other cousin Romy, and his godmother Hannah. He\u2019s forever walking into the living room to find us all gabbing about Strictly, listening to the Rolling Stones and dancing embarrassingly after drinking too much prosecco.

Last weekend, were it not for Ben Foster, they could easily have beaten Watford by ten goals; as it panned out, were it not for Kepa Arrizabalaga, they\u2019d have ended up drawing 2-2. They can just as easily ship points at home as thrash someone away. They\u2019re making Kevin Keegan\u2019s Newcastle look like Helenio Herrera\u2019s Inter. Yeah, they\u2019re a whole world of fun.</p> \n  <p><strong>They\u2019ve also won five Premier League matches in a row - a sequence that\u2019s earned Lampard the manager-of-the-month award for October - so today\u2019s visitors Crystal Palace will approach Stamford Bridge with some trepidation. </strong>The Eagles haven\u2019t won in three, and they\u2019ve only scored ten goals in their first 11 matches. In that sense, they\u2019re going into the lion\u2019s cage with neither whip nor chair.</p> \n  <p><strong>Then again, Palace have already won at Old Trafford this season, no small feat even when Manchester United aren\u2019t at the top of their game. </strong>And they came back from two goals down to draw at Arsenal, no small feat even when Arsenal etc., and so on, and so forth. Plus Roy Hodgson will be in a celebratory mood: it\u2019s his 300th game as a Premier League manager. So congratulations to him for that.</p> \n  <p><strong>Chelsea have won the last three against Palace, and everyone expects them to make it four in a row this lunchtime. </strong>Will they reclaim third place, for a few hours at least? Or will Palace frustrate another big boy on the road? We\u2019re about to find out. It\u2019s on!</p> \n  <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>12.30pm GMT.</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Jacob Steinberg was our man at Stamford Bridge. Here\u2019s his report. Enjoy ... and thanks for reading this MBM. And now a word with Mr Roy. \u201cI can\u2019t really ask more of my players. Unfortunately we met a Chelsea that had their tails up, and who really wanted to win the game. If we kept in the game a little bit longer, we might have done a little bit more. We were growing into the game. I have no qualms about the way the players played, and the work we put in. Unfortunately we weren\u2019t able to get any points. I have no criticisms of anybody, we played one of the country\u2019s top teams.\u201d Frank Lampard talks to BT. \u201cWe\u2019re happy with what we\u2019re doing. We respect where Liverpool and Manchester City are. This season is about bridging the gap. At the minute we\u2019re staying close and we\u2019re in good form. I\u2019m proud of the players and I believe in them. It was a really impressive game from Reece James, against Wilfried Zaha, and he\u2019s only going to get better. You never know with young players until you put them in. But they\u2019ve shown they\u2019ve got the mindset and ability and desire to play for Chelsea. I\u2019ll enjoy maybe two bottles of wine tonight!\u201d Tammy Abraham, who today joined Jamie Vardy as the Premier League\u2019s leading scorer, on ten, speaks to BT Sport. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t out best game, but the most important thing was we got the three points. Crystal Palace are a good side, and in the first half they frustrated us. We believed, we didn\u2019t change our style of play, we continued our attacking football and scored two goals. I\u2019m so proud to be the number nine.\u201d It\u2019s six wins in a row for Chelsea, and they go second in the Premier League table, for a few hours at least. 90 min +4: Willian sends a power-curler towards the top left. Just over the bar. 90 min +3: Gilmour flicks the ball over McCarthy\u2019s head, and is kicked for his cheek. A booking for the Palace sub, and it\u2019s a free kick just outside the D. Willian\u2019s eyes light up. 90 min +1: Kante finds Batshuayi on the penalty spot, with his back to goal. Batshuayi has Hudson-Odoi to his left, in acres of space, but a striker\u2019s a striker\u2019s a striker, and he opts to shoot on the turn instead. Wrong choice. Hudson-Odoi flings his arms around in frustration. 90 min: There will be four added minutes. While we wait for the clock to run down, here\u2019s Mary Waltz, reporting from over the pond: \u201cYou have no idea how thrilled our nation\u2019s football fans are to see one of our own show the skill and flair that Pulisic is displaying lately. Our men\u2019s national team is in the doldrums and Pulisic gives us a ray of hope that things might improve. Maybe we can supply the Premier League something other then just goalies.\u201d 88 min: Gilmour\u2019s first touch sends Hudson-Odoi racing down the left. The striker cuts in and slaps a shot just wide of the bottom-right corner. 87 min: Mount is replaced by Billy Gilmour. 86 min: But this is much better. Zaha drives down the left, cuts inside, and pulls back for McCarthy, who slams a shot towards the bottom left from the edge of the box. Kepa is down quickly to smother. 85 min: McCarthy rolls a pass wide left for Zaha, who lets the ball run under his foot and out for a throw. Palace\u2019s star man has been poor today. He looks beyond frustrated. 84 min: Schlupp clips Willian\u2019s heels, and he\u2019s fortunate not to go into the book. 83 min: Schlupp tries to release Ayew through the middle, but his pass is too heavy and Kepa is quickly out to claim. 82 min: Palace\u2019s last substitution: McCarthy for Kouyate. 80 min: That\u2019s Pulisic\u2019s last contribution. The excellent USA international is replaced by Hudson-Odoi. Chelsea ping the ball around for a while. Then suddenly Kovacic, quarterbacking deep on the right, switches play towards Pulisic out on the left. Pulisic drives towards the box and slips inside for Batshuayi, who swivels and shoots. His shot is blocked, and loops into the air. Pulisic had kept running, and is in situ to guide a header home from six yards. 77 min: Willian sends Mount into space down the left. Mount shoots. Tomkins blocks. Chelsea come back at Palace, Emerson bombing down the left and screeching a shot across the face of goal. There must have been a deflection, because it results in a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece. Both teams are doing their damnedest to score the second goal of the afternoon. 75 min: Pulisic has the chance to slip Batshuayi free down the middle, but his sliderule pass is intercepted cannily by Tomkins. 73 min: Zouma will be good to continue. But it\u2019s the end of the road for the goalscorer Abraham, who is replaced by Batshuayi. 72 min: Kelly crosses from the right. Ayew and Zouma clash heads. The ball drops to Zaha, who tries to nudge it back from the left in the hope of shooting towards the top right. But he can\u2019t make room. Then the play\u2019s stopped so Zouma can get treatment for his sore neep. 70 min: Milivojevic curls the free kick to the far post. Tomkins is clear, and simply must score, but heads wide left. What a chance that was. Palace are beginning to ask a few questions of the hosts. 69 min: Tomori clips Ayew as the Palace striker tears down the right. It\u2019ll be a free kick, and a chance to load the box. But first, on comes Schlupp for McArthur. 67 min: Mount slips a pass down the inside left. Pulisic cuts in from the wing and goes for goal. He scores three of your rugby points. 65 min: Zaha zips down the left and beats James again. He\u2019s got options in the box, but balloons a cross over everyone in the area and out for a goal kick. But Palace come back at Chelsea in short order, McArthur crossing from a deep position on the right. Zaha, coming in at the far post, can\u2019t get a header on target. Much better from Palace. 63 min: Zaha robs James, just inside the Chelsea box on the left. That\u2019s some fine hassling. But the subsequent dribble is down a dead end, and there\u2019s no chance to shoot or set up a team-mate. 61 min: But Chelsea really fancy this now, and they\u2019re quickly coming back at Palace. Willian drives into the box from the left, and could go down having been nudged off balance. Instead he stays on his feet and tees up Abraham, who lashes wildly into the stand behind. 60 min: The corner\u2019s hit way too long, a waste. But Abraham salvages the situation by winning a throw out on the right. From the throw, Kante finds space to shoot on the edge of the box. But he opts to lay off to Willian, who can\u2019t get a shot away. Palace shut the door, just in time. 58 min: Pulisic dances in from the left and pearls a rising shot towards the top left. Guaita sticks out a strong arm to tip it over the bar. 56 min: Van Aanholt dribbles with purpose down the middle, and slips a pass to Kouyate, just inside the Chelsea box on the right. Kouyate is in acres of space, but doesn\u2019t seem to realise it. He dithers before shooting, and his effort is blocked. But that\u2019s better from Palace, who have to come out now. 54 min: It\u2019s fair to say that Chelsea have rediscovered that early verve, then. Mount has a crack. It\u2019s blocked, and nearly falls to Abraham, but luck\u2019s not on their side and Palace survive. So having said that, Chelsea immediately open the scoring. Kovacic bursts in from the left and lays off to Willian, who plays a first-time flick around the corner, sending Abraham free into the box down the inside-left channel. Abraham draws Guaita and slips the ball into the bottom right. What a lovely move! 51 min: More midfield noodling by Chelsea, who have lost their early verve. \u201cThanks for the article on Peter Reid,\u201d writes Mary Waltz. \u201cLeave it to a footballer to describe both of our countries leaders in one simple accurate sentence. Straight, no ice, pure.\u201d 49 min: Chelsea are hogging the ball, but Palace continue to hold their shape. A heavy touch by Abraham on the edge of the box generates the first loud groan of the afternoon. A little bit of frustration bubbling to the surface. 47 min: James looks to release Willian down the right. His pass is deflected off Mount, which means Willian is offside when the ball reaches him. Willian slams the shot into the side netting anyway. Chelsea get the second half underway. It\u2019s started to pelt down at Stamford Bridge. Stair rods. No half-time changes. Pulisic miscontrols just inside the Palace box. The ball spins up onto Kelly\u2019s hand, but the defender was standing right next to Pulisic, and couldn\u2019t get out of the way, even though he was withdrawing his hand at speed. On the touchline, Frank Lampard makes the claim with passion, but the referee\u2019s not interested. Half-time entertainment. You have got to love Peter Reid. Chelsea walk off in the exasperated fashion. Palace have refused to buckle. 45 min +4: Kepa rolls the ball out to Zouma, putting the defender in trouble, with Zaha in close attendance. Zaha nearly strips Zouma, who stumbles, and is given the benefit of the doubt by the referee. A generous free kick. Chelsea go up the other end and nearly score themselves, James crossing from the right, Willian seeing his close-range shot blocked by former Stamford Bridge hero Cahill. A busy end to the half. 45 min +2: Kante crosses from the right. Pulisic rises highest and wins a header, but can only send it harmlessly over the bar. 45 min: There will be four added minutes. 44 min: Palace can now make their substitution. Ward, who looks to have a groin strain, limps off and is replaced by Martin Kelly. 43 min: Pulisic drops a shoulder and nearly skins Townsend. He earns a corner. Before that can be taken, Ward goes down, having hurt himself while challenging Emerson back there. Looks like he\u2019ll be going off soon. But not before this corner. From the set piece, Willian tries to curl one into the top right, but Guaita claims calmly. 41 min: Willian is nudged to the ground by McArthur out on the right. A chance to load the Palace box. Willian will deliver. He hoicks long, in the hope of finding Emerson at the far post. Emerson wins a corner off Ward, but the flag goes up for offside. That\u2019s a poor decision, as the Chelsea full-back was clearly on. But that\u2019s the pressure off Palace. 39 min: See 37 min. Stamford Bridge has fallen a little quiet as a result. 37 min: A bit of possession in the Palace half for Chelsea. They\u2019re held at arm\u2019s length, though. Palace are beginning to look a little bit more comfortable. They\u2019re keeping a good shape. Classic Roy. 35 min: James is the recipient of a lecture from Mike Dean, after the young full-back has a full and frank exchange of views with the linesman. An argument about nothing. He\u2019s ordered to pipe down, but there\u2019s no booking. 34 min: Another booking for Chelsea, who are suddenly looking a little ragged. Kovacic earns it for a slide into the back of Townsend. 32 min: Milivojevic whips the free kick over everyone in the box and out of play, wide right of goal. What a waste. 31 min: Palace ping the ball around in pretty triangles, and at speed, their first decent period of progressive possession in the match. Townsend is fouled, but the referee plays advantage. James then clatters Zaha, just to the left of the area. It\u2019s a free kick. But first the ref goes back to book Emerson for the foul on Townsend. 29 min: Mount\u2019s free kick is poor, straight into the Palace wall. He grimaces in frustration, a great chance to work Guaita spurned. 28 min: Mount is clumsily bundled over on the edge of the Palace D. He\u2019ll get up and take this himself. 27 min: Pulisic dribbles down the left and somehow manages to create enough space to shoot, out of pretty much nothing. He\u2019s a rare talent. But instead of shooting, he lays off for Kante, who is in a better position and takes a shot from the edge of the box. It\u2019s blocked as it was whistling towards the bottom left. 25 min: Palace haven\u2019t done much attacking so far. Zaha tries to get them going, slipping a speculative ball down the inside left for Ayew to chase. Zouma is on hand to shepherd the Palace striker away from the ball. Then Townsend embarks on a sortie down the right, but he can\u2019t produce a worthwhile cross, and their rare excursion into Chelsea territory is over. 23 min: Emerson has a go at this one, and it\u2019s not great. He\u2019s looking for the top right, but he\u2019s nowhere near. Goal kick. 22 min: Now Zaha goes in the book. He\u2019s shown the yellow card for a blatant tug on Willian, who had just robbed him of possession and was making off down the inside right. Another free kick in a promising position for Chelsea. 20 min: Pulisic is a wonderful player. He tap-dances around in the Palace area, showcasing some fine ball control in a very limited space. He can\u2019t quite open Palace up, but it\u2019s an entertaining watch nonetheless. 19 min: Zaha nudges Kovacic off the ball. It\u2019s a garden-variety free kick in the middle of the park, but Zaha is fortunate not to join Willian in the referee\u2019s notebook, after kicking the ball away in frustration. 17 min: Yep, someone\u2019s going into the book. But it\u2019s not a Palace player. Emerson wins a corner for Chelsea out on the left. Willian takes, but Kouyate clears at the near post. Ayew looks to launch a quick counter down the right, and he\u2019s cynically brought down by Willian, the Chelsea captain taking one for the team. Out comes the yellow. 16 min: Palace are giving away a lot of free kicks in their own half. Now it\u2019s Ward, high-kicking Abraham out on the left wing. Chelsea do nothing with the set piece, but Palace can\u2019t keep doing this. Someone will be going in the book sooner rather than later. 14 min: Willian curls a fantastic free kick over the wall, up and back down towards the top-right corner. Half of the stadium cheer, convinced the ball\u2019s gone in, but it\u2019s inches wide of the right-hand post. And Guaita had it covered in any case. A highly decent effort, though. 13 min: James is brought down by McArthur as he teases the Palace man down the inside-right channel. This is a free kick in a dangerous position. Willian fancies this. 12 min: Willian strides at great pace down the middle of the park. He slips the ball wide left for Pulisic, who enters the box and sends Ward sliding off in the Puskas-Wright style with a cute pullback. For a second it looks as though we\u2019ll be witnessing a goal for the ages, but his next touch takes him too close to Guaita, who can smother. What skill, though. And what a pacy no-nonsense attack. Chelsea are very good to watch. 10 min: Mount nicks the ball off Kouyate and is immediately hacked down by Milivojevic for his cheek. A free kick out on the left, and a chance for Chelsea to load the box. Mount takes himself, and it\u2019s a poor delivery, aimless and without pace. Palace clear this set piece as well. 9 min: Willian tears past Van Aanholt out on the right, and earns a corner off McArthur. He takes it himself. Abraham tries to get a header on target, but the ball skims off the top of his head. Palace clear. 7 min: Pulisic glides in from the left and takes a shot from distance. It dribbles wide of the left-hand post. Guaita had it covered. 6 min: Willian, captain for the day, goes on a dribble down the right. Some fancy footwork. He\u2019s going nowhere this time, but Chelsea appear to be in a buoyant mood. Five league wins in a row, who can blame them? 4 min: Some possession in the midfield for Chelsea. Palace haven\u2019t had a sniff yet. \u201cCakes sent to the soldiers in the trenches were normally egg free due to rations, and contained vinegar to help the cake to rise,\u201d notes James Ellis, while contemplating the remembrance spread laid on in the press room. \u201cI hope it\u2019s at least authentic.\u201d Wishing discomfort on a room of freeloading football journalists? Who could countenance such a thing? Ah. 2 min: The corner\u2019s cleared without too much fuss. But what a statement of intent from Chelsea, who have got the hang of show-business rather quickly under Frank Lampard. And we\u2019re off! Chelsea are immediately on the front foot, and within 15 seconds Pulisic is on the edge of the Palace box looking for a chance to shoot. He can\u2019t get one away, but Kovacic has a go instead. It\u2019s blocked. Then James whips in a cross from the right, forcing Guaita to tip over for the first corner of the match. The teams are out! Chelsea wear their famous royal blue, while Palace are in third-choice white with Team of the Eighties sash. It\u2019s a fine atmosphere at Stamford Bridge, hopefully everyone\u2019s enjoyed their lunch, whether in solid or liquid form. It\u2019s a dreich day in west London, but hopefully Frank\u2019s Freewheelers will bring the sunshine, one way or another. A blast of the Liquidator. A couple of Chelsea pensioners take to the field as Stamford Bridge remembers. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. Roy Hodgson speaks ahead of his 300th match in a Premier League dugout. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get easier, but it doesn\u2019t get harder. The job is the same and it\u2019s a job I love doing. I\u2019m proud to have 300 Premier League games, it\u2019s not easy to rack up that number. It\u2019s a good day, but to make it a really good day it\u2019s got to be a good performance for the Crystal Palace team, and hopefully some points to take home to Selhurst Park.\u201d Frank Lampard reflects on the wild and wonderful Ajax match. \u201cI enjoyed it. Fans come to be entertained and it was an entertaining match, for good and for bad. I think it was more good for us, because of the spirit showed, but we must turn our heads to this game. It\u2019s a tough match going into the international break. I\u2019ve got a lot of respect for Roy Hodgson and they\u2019re good on the road. It\u2019s going to be tough and we need to be on it.\u201d There will be a minute\u2019s silent reflection before kick-off in honour of the fallen. The lucky denizens of the press room will be able to show their gratitude for the ultimate sacrifices of generations past via the medium of sponge cake, because this is a thing now. The ration book is a nice period touch, and could be construed as acid comment on Chelsea\u2019s transfer ban. N\u2019Golo Kante is back for Chelsea! He\u2019s one of three changes to the XI named for the absurd eight-goal thriller with Ajax. Also in: Emerson and young midweek hero Reece James. Club captain Cesar Azpilicueta puts his feet up on the bench, while Jorginho (suspension) and Marcos Alonso (poor form) drop out altogether. Mason Mount passed a late fitness test on his ankle. Palace make just the one change to the team named for the 2-0 defeat to Leicester last Sunday. Andros Townsend is back from injury and replaces Jeffrey Schlupp. James McArthur keeps his place despite a back problem. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, James, Tomori, Zouma, Emerson, Kante, Kovacic, Willian, Mount, Pulisic, Abraham. Subs: Christensen, Caballero, Giroud, Hudson-Odoi, Batshuayi, Azpilicueta, Gilmour. Crystal Palace: Guaita, Ward, Tomkins, Cahill, van Aanholt, Townsend, Kouyate, Milivojevic, McArthur, Zaha, Ayew. Subs: Dann, Hennessey, Schlupp, Benteke, McCarthy, Kelly, Riedewald. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral). Chelsea are a lot of fun right now. So far this season, Frankie\u2019s Freewheelers have been involved in a 7-1, a 5-2, a 4-2, a 4-1, a 3-2, two 2-2s and of course that wonderfully absurd 4-4 against Ajax the other night. Last weekend, were it not for Ben Foster, they could easily have beaten Watford by ten goals; as it panned out, were it not for Kepa Arrizabalaga, they\u2019d have ended up drawing 2-2. They can just as easily ship points at home as thrash someone away. They\u2019re making Kevin Keegan\u2019s Newcastle look like Helenio Herrera\u2019s Inter. Yeah, they\u2019re a whole world of fun. They\u2019ve also won five Premier League matches in a row - a sequence that\u2019s earned Lampard the manager-of-the-month award for October - so today\u2019s visitors Crystal Palace will approach Stamford Bridge with some trepidation. The Eagles haven\u2019t won in three, and they\u2019ve only scored ten goals in their first 11 matches. In that sense, they\u2019re going into the lion\u2019s cage with neither whip nor chair. Then again, Palace have already won at Old Trafford this season, no small feat even when Manchester United aren\u2019t at the top of their game. And they came back from two goals down to draw at Arsenal, no small feat even when Arsenal etc., and so on, and so forth. Plus Roy Hodgson will be in a celebratory mood: it\u2019s his 300th game as a Premier League manager. So congratulations to him for that. Chelsea have won the last three against Palace, and everyone expects them to make it four in a row this lunchtime. Will they reclaim third place, for a few hours at least? Or will Palace frustrate another big boy on the road? We\u2019re about to find out. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>Thirty years ago, Elfriede Begrich delivered a stirring sermon to a packed Gethsemane church in East Berlin. She quoted Deuteronomy 2.7: \u201cGod watches over you as you wander through this great wilderness\u201d. \u201cIn those days every verse in the Bible sounded like a political manifesto,\u201d the former Protestant pastor recalled this Saturday.</p> \n<p>Her congregation got the message. On 4 November 1989 they flooded onto the streets by the thousands bearing lit candles to protest against a repressive East German regime that days later would yield power to people and raise the toll bars at the border crossings in the city. As the reunified German capital commemorated the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, revellers were able to hear Begrich\u2019s words again.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/08/world-failed-learn-lessons-berlin-wall-say-film-makers\">World has failed to learn lessons of Berlin Wall, say film-makers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A filmed re-enactment of the pivotal protest in Alexanderplatz, curated by her son Aljoscha and directed by the Argentinian artist Lola Arias, played on a loop inside the nearby ruins of the former East German statistics office, one of 200 commemorative events playing out at seven locations across the city. Begrich was the only performer who had chosen to play herself.</p> \n<p>Flooded with the memories of the dramatic last few days of the socialist republic, she recalled the \u201cimmense feeling of freedom\u201d on the streets that day.

      "bodyText": "Thirty years ago, Elfriede Begrich delivered a stirring sermon to a packed Gethsemane church in East Berlin. She quoted Deuteronomy 2.7: \u201cGod watches over you as you wander through this great wilderness\u201d. \u201cIn those days every verse in the Bible sounded like a political manifesto,\u201d the former Protestant pastor recalled this Saturday. Her congregation got the message. On 4 November 1989 they flooded onto the streets by the thousands bearing lit candles to protest against a repressive East German regime that days later would yield power to people and raise the toll bars at the border crossings in the city. As the reunified German capital commemorated the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, revellers were able to hear Begrich\u2019s words again. A filmed re-enactment of the pivotal protest in Alexanderplatz, curated by her son Aljoscha and directed by the Argentinian artist Lola Arias, played on a loop inside the nearby ruins of the former East German statistics office, one of 200 commemorative events playing out at seven locations across the city. Begrich was the only performer who had chosen to play herself. Flooded with the memories of the dramatic last few days of the socialist republic, she recalled the \u201cimmense feeling of freedom\u201d on the streets that day. But reliving the emotion was no longer easy. \u201c30 years on, remembering those days is a much more contemplative process than even on the 20th anniversary,\u201d she said. \u201cThe memory of my emotions is tainted with a certain darkness. \u201cI had taken to the streets for a third way, not the old socialism we had in the GDR, but neither the rapacious Manchester capitalism of the west. I wanted socialism with a human face \u2026 But the peaceful revolution soon slipped from the grasp of those who really wanted it. It became the revolution of those who wanted to buy colour TVs and bananas.\u201d The 72-year-old was not the only Berliner in a reflective mood on Saturday. Previous Berlin Wall anniversaries have been triumphant events. 10 years ago, the city organised two kilometres of gigantic styrofoam slabs to be lined up between the Brandenburg Gate and Potsdamer Platz, which were then toppled like dominoes.

      "bodyText": "A Labour MP has denied altering the lyrics of the Beatles song Hey Jude to \u201chey Jews\u201d while a colleague has been accused of repeatedly using the word \u201cpoof\u201d during a coach journey last year. Daniel Carden, the acting shadow international development secretary, is accused by BuzzFeed of singing an adapted version of the song while on a trip from the Cheltenham festival to London. Conor McGinn, a former Labour whip who is standing for re-election as MP for St Helens North, is reported by the website to have repeatedly called another colleague a \u201cpoof\u201d during the same journey on 15 March 2018. Carden, the Labour candidate for Liverpool Walton, denied the allegations, tweeting: \u201cThis was a coach full of journalists and MPs. If anyone genuinely believed any antisemitic behaviour had taken place, they would\u2019ve had a moral responsibility to report it immediately. \u201cYet this allegation is only made now when a general election is imminent. I stand by my record as an antiracist campaigner. I would never be part of any behaviour that undermines my commitment to fighting racism in all its forms.\u201d The allegations follow comments by the former home secretary and Labour peer David Blunkett\u2019s that antisemitism and \u201cthuggery\u201d within the party made him despair. Blunkett urged moderates to \u201cstay and fight\u201d to ensure the \u201cvoice of reason\u201d prevailed following Tom Watson\u2019s decision to stand down as deputy leader. A spokesman for Carden told BuzzFeed he would never intentionally engage in racist or antisemitic behaviour. The spokesman said: \u201cDaniel Carden has been a committed campaigner in support of LGBT rights and against all forms of racism and hatred, his entire political life. As a homosexual man he would never intentionally engage in homophobic, racist or antisemitic behaviour. Had there been genuine concerns as to Daniel\u2019s behaviour then those concerns should have been raised at the time rather than some 20 months later on the eve of a general election.\u201d A spokesperson for McGinn said: \u201cConor\u2019s record as a staunch supporter of the LGBT community speaks for itself. As an MP he led the campaign which delivered a monumental and historic change in the law to finally extend equal marriage to the whole of the UK.\u201d Mark Tami, who is standing for re-election in Alyn and Deeside, said: \u201cI was on the bus and didn\u2019t hear any singing of this nature.\u201d Another person from within Labour also told Sky News he was on the coach with Carden and did not hear those words being uttered. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, described the allegations as \u201cdisgusting\u201d. She tweeted: \u201cAt a time when the Jewish community feels under threat due to rising antisemitism, politicians have a duty to stand with them, not mock them.\u201d When asked about the allegations during his visit to Leeds, Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u201cDan Carden has emphatically denied that. It is an awful story and if it\u2019s true it is utterly and totally unacceptable. I am looking into it.\u201d Corbyn also responded to Blunkett\u2019s remarks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that David Blunkett has chosen this time to say that,\u201d he said. \u201cI lead a party that is huge. It\u2019s half a million members. I lead a party that\u2019s very determined to tackle inequality, poverty and injustice in this country.\u201d The Labour leader was asked about a letter from female Labour MPs urging the national executive committee (NEC) to block Kate Osborne from becoming the party\u2019s candidate in Jarrow after she allegedly posted an image of Theresa May with a gun. Corbyn said: \u201cShe is going through a process. A panel will be conducted over the weekend to select a candidate for the Jarrow constituency and no doubt all those questions will be put to her as any question will be put to any of the candidates.\u201d Labour has faced fresh antisemitism claims this week after Gideon Bull, a parliamentary candidate, withdrew from standing in the general election following accusations he used the term \u201cShylock\u201d at a meeting where a Jewish councillor was present. He denied any intention to insult and has apologised for making the remark. Bull, a councillor from the London borough of Haringey, was intending to stand in the Essex seaside town of Clacton. Labour blocked the leftwing campaigner Chris Williamson from standing as a candidate in the general election after he was suspended over accusations he had downplayed antisemitism in the party. Williamson, the former MP for Derby North, was one of three Labour candidates told they would not be allowed stand following a day-long meeting of the party\u2019s ruling body. Zarah Sultana, a Labour general election candidate for Coventry South, apologised earlier this week for saying she would celebrate the deaths of world leaders including Tony Blair and Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. She said she had been \u201cexasperated by endless cycles of global suffering, violence and needless killing\u201d. Sultana also wrote of her support for \u201cviolent resistance\u201d by Palestinians in 2015, the Jewish Chronicle reported. She told the BBC the tweets were from a \u201cdeleted account dating back several years from when I was a student\u201d. \u201cI do not support violence and I should not have articulated my anger in the manner I did, for which I apologise,\u201d she said.",

Instead, the 30-second clip focuses on praising Donald Trump \u2013 the president who fired Sessions as attorney general in November 2018 after ritually humiliating him on the national stage. \u201cJeff Sessions here and I approved this ad,\u201d begins the sprightly 72-year-old Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III in his inimitable Alabama lilt, against a plain background in the 30-second spot, entitled \u201cGreat Job\u201d. \u201cWhen I left President Trump\u2019s cabinet, did I write a tell-all book? No. Did I go on CNN and attack the president? Nope. Have I said a cross word about that president? Not one time. And I\u2019ll tell you why. \u201cFirst, that would be dishonourable. I was there to serve his agenda, not mine. \u201cSecond, the president\u2019s doing a great job for America and Alabama, and he has my strong support.\u201d And that\u2019s it \u2013 no mention of the Senate campaign, other than a logo at the top left of the screen at the start and end of the tape. The ad can be explained by the strong support Trump retains in the Republican party, even under the cloud of an impeachment inquiry, low national approval ratings and electoral reverses at state level this week. At least in party primaries, to depart from the Donald is still to sign one\u2019s own death warrant. Trump also had Sessions\u2019 strong support in February 2016, when the rightwing senator and immigration hawk was the first member of that august body to endorse the billionaire\u2019s run for the Republican nomination, a scorched-earth campaign which left the Bush dynasty in ruins and only the widely disliked Texas senator Ted Cruz providing a meaningful fight at the polls. Sessions became attorney general and his aide Stephen Miller became a key hard-right adviser to the president. But Trump did not have Sessions\u2019 strong support when in March 2017 the Alabaman recused himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation into Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow.

Trump added: \u201cWhere\u2019s my Roy Cohn?\u201d Cohn, a lawyer with mob ties who was once an aide to the infamous Senator Joe McCarthy, worked for Trump in the cut-throat world of New York real estate. Trump is also reported to have repeatedly bemoaned his lack of a Bobby Kennedy or an Eric Holder, attorneys general he is convinced protected presidents John F Kennedy and Barack Obama. Many observers suggest Sessions\u2019 successor in office, William Barr, is much more the kind of attorney general-cum-consigliere Trump has had in mind. Advised by friends including the No2 Senate Republican John Cornyn to make it right with Trump, Sessions declared his run for his old Senate seat this week. It was lost to the Democrats in December 2017 when the Republican candidate, Judge Roy Moore, was accused of sexual misconduct involving underage girls. Moore, who denied the claims, is also running for the nomination to face Democratic incumbent Doug Jones at the polls next year. Early reviews of Sessions\u2019 ad tended, in mainstream media at least, to emphasise that it was meant for \u201can audience of one\u201d, a familiar phrase in a world where White House aides\u2019 performances on news shows seem calibrated solely to please a president addicted to TiVo and with a worldview shaped by the ratings.

      "body": "<p>\u201cDelete, delete, delete!\u201d yells Lizzo, clad in gold corsetry, tossing her long hair. \u201cBlock, block, block!\u201d The screaming from the sold-out crowd intensifies. We are between songs on the first night of two at London\u2019s nearly 5,000-capacity Brixton Academy, and this partisan crowd goes from a steady love-bath of affirmative cheering for Lizzo \u2013 Melissa Jefferson, the multi-hyphenated US rapper-singer-flautist who has been the talk of 2019 \u2013 to a hungry, feral roar.</p> <p>Lizzo\u2019s gig has so many high points that you could probably see it from space and mistake it for a major geographic feature. She starts the set in a pulpit wearing a gold robe in front of a backdrop of stained glass themed around hearts, launching full pelt into the gospel-house opener Heaven Help Me. At the end, for a huge rendition of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaCrQL_8eMY&amp;list=PLHJGwTVdN5IjMV4T-7p-pQu1sDcWm7oZS&amp;index=5&amp;t=0s\" title=\"\">Juice</a>, she whips out <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sashabefluting/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Sasha Flute</a> \u2013 an instrument named after a Beyonc\u00e9 alter ego Sasha Fierce \u2013 and twerks while playing.</p> <p>In between, Lizzo makes her fans inhale positivity and sigh out negativity a full three times, like a particularly bossy yoga teacher. Throughout, there is the joyous succour of a crowd of people singing an entire album of self-affirmation back at its author, who fans herself and tears up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jerome, a big, blowsy old-time ballad that waves the ex \u2018out the door\u2019, has with 5,000 backing vocalists concurring</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But this particular between-song moment is easily one of the set\u2019s loftiest, crystallising Lizzo\u2019s central role in 2019. Many pop singers offer performative aloofness. Lizzo\u2019s appeal is her gutsy relatability, the way in which the 31-year-old former classical musician pairs righteousness and body positivity with candour and self-doubt. As Lizzo tells the rapt audience, she was recently contacted by her ex, the now-infamous subject of one of her biggest tracks, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P00HMxdsVZI\" title=\"\">Truth Hurts</a>. The story of Truth Hurts is central to Lizzo, formerly a cult indie rapper with two albums to her name, now the holder of both the <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8542920/lizzo-no-1-2-spots-hot-rb-hip-hop-songs-chart\" title=\"\">top two positions</a> on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/hip-hop charts and a strong contender for the <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8533544/billie-eilish-lizzo-best-new-artist-2020-grammys-predictions\" title=\"\">best new artist Grammy</a>.</p> <p>Truth Hurts first came out in 2017, written in the aftermath of a breakup when Lizzo\u2019s former man went back to his previous girlfriend. The producer with whom Lizzo was recording took notes while she ranted and told her she had just written a great song. Truth Hurts regained traction this year in part because its hook \u2013 \u201cI took a DNA test, turns out I am 100% that bitch\u201d \u2013 became a meme on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXvRCGrbRMw\" title=\"\">TikTok</a>, a social media app; the song also featured on the soundtrack of a Netflix film (<em>Someone Great</em>).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P00HMxdsVZI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P00HMxdsVZI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the video to Lizzo\u2019s Truth Hurts.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>More heat was generated when Lizzo\u2019s latest album, her major label debut, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/20/lizzo-cuz-i-love-you-review\" title=\"\">Cuz I Love You</a></em>, was released in April to near-universal acclaim. It too was themed around the same breakup. (One US reviewer said it was <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lizzo-cuz-i-love-you/\" title=\"\">less than perfect</a>; Lizzo took to Twitter to <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/lizzo-sparks-debate-arguing-musicians-review-albums-2479629\" title=\"\">complain</a>.)</p> <p>The success of Truth Hurts eventually resulted in a claim by two male songwriters that they had co-written much of the track. Lizzo is now suing them, but was ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/23/lizzo-truth-hurts-plagiarism-mina-lioness\" title=\"\">forced to credi</a>t a viral tweet by a female songwriter as the original source of the \u201c100% bitch\u201d phrase. That so many people became so invested in the song of a meme of a tweet remains just one of the things that makes Lizzo so tremendously 2019.</p> <p>As the singer tells it tonight, that very same Truth Hurts ex got in touch with her on Halloween (Lizzo, by the way, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNS5_E5DC_1sCCxfp1wc2lkgs9ojAQ:1573134472111&amp;q=lizzo+dna+test+halloween&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;client=firefox-b-d&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNS5_E5DC_1sCCxfp1wc2lkgs9ojAQ:1573134472111&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjGmZPLntjlAhUhQEEAHSvAC8EQsAR6BAgIEAE&amp;biw=1250&amp;bih=621\" title=\"\">dressed up as a DNA test</a>, revealing a bodysuit that read \u201c100% that bitch\u201d).</p> <p>She then reveals that his other woman also messaged her. A sharp intake of female breath in the venue follows, before Lizzo savagely mimes blocking and deleting them both from her phone and the place erupts into screams. With consummate professionalism, Lizzo then launches into a knockout version of Jerome, a big, blowsy old-time ballad that waves the ex \u201cout the door\u201d, with 5,000 backing vocalists concurring. The song is lit up by a galaxy of phone torches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b343b4079a1477f7bc7ee4fd29fd99ebce390ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b343b4079a1477f7bc7ee4fd29fd99ebce390ec/0_0_5089_3260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lizzo at Brixton Academy,.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lizzo at Brixton Academy,.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lizzo, her DJ, Sophia Eris, and her bevy of plus-size dancers have been touring this album in venues and on television shows nonstop all year, and it is all hugely, cathartically entertaining \u2013 a big, warm, slightly rude hug of a night out.

      "bodyText": "\u201cDelete, delete, delete!\u201d yells Lizzo, clad in gold corsetry, tossing her long hair. \u201cBlock, block, block!\u201d The screaming from the sold-out crowd intensifies. We are between songs on the first night of two at London\u2019s nearly 5,000-capacity Brixton Academy, and this partisan crowd goes from a steady love-bath of affirmative cheering for Lizzo \u2013 Melissa Jefferson, the multi-hyphenated US rapper-singer-flautist who has been the talk of 2019 \u2013 to a hungry, feral roar. Lizzo\u2019s gig has so many high points that you could probably see it from space and mistake it for a major geographic feature. She starts the set in a pulpit wearing a gold robe in front of a backdrop of stained glass themed around hearts, launching full pelt into the gospel-house opener Heaven Help Me. At the end, for a huge rendition of Juice, she whips out Sasha Flute \u2013 an instrument named after a Beyonc\u00e9 alter ego Sasha Fierce \u2013 and twerks while playing. In between, Lizzo makes her fans inhale positivity and sigh out negativity a full three times, like a particularly bossy yoga teacher. Throughout, there is the joyous succour of a crowd of people singing an entire album of self-affirmation back at its author, who fans herself and tears up. But this particular between-song moment is easily one of the set\u2019s loftiest, crystallising Lizzo\u2019s central role in 2019. Many pop singers offer performative aloofness. Lizzo\u2019s appeal is her gutsy relatability, the way in which the 31-year-old former classical musician pairs righteousness and body positivity with candour and self-doubt. As Lizzo tells the rapt audience, she was recently contacted by her ex, the now-infamous subject of one of her biggest tracks, Truth Hurts. The story of Truth Hurts is central to Lizzo, formerly a cult indie rapper with two albums to her name, now the holder of both the top two positions on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/hip-hop charts and a strong contender for the best new artist Grammy. Truth Hurts first came out in 2017, written in the aftermath of a breakup when Lizzo\u2019s former man went back to his previous girlfriend. The producer with whom Lizzo was recording took notes while she ranted and told her she had just written a great song. Truth Hurts regained traction this year in part because its hook \u2013 \u201cI took a DNA test, turns out I am 100% that bitch\u201d \u2013 became a meme on TikTok, a social media app; the song also featured on the soundtrack of a Netflix film (Someone Great). More heat was generated when Lizzo\u2019s latest album, her major label debut, Cuz I Love You, was released in April to near-universal acclaim. It too was themed around the same breakup. (One US reviewer said it was less than perfect; Lizzo took to Twitter to complain.) The success of Truth Hurts eventually resulted in a claim by two male songwriters that they had co-written much of the track. Lizzo is now suing them, but was ultimately forced to credit a viral tweet by a female songwriter as the original source of the \u201c100% bitch\u201d phrase. That so many people became so invested in the song of a meme of a tweet remains just one of the things that makes Lizzo so tremendously 2019. As the singer tells it tonight, that very same Truth Hurts ex got in touch with her on Halloween (Lizzo, by the way, dressed up as a DNA test, revealing a bodysuit that read \u201c100% that bitch\u201d). She then reveals that his other woman also messaged her. A sharp intake of female breath in the venue follows, before Lizzo savagely mimes blocking and deleting them both from her phone and the place erupts into screams. With consummate professionalism, Lizzo then launches into a knockout version of Jerome, a big, blowsy old-time ballad that waves the ex \u201cout the door\u201d, with 5,000 backing vocalists concurring. The song is lit up by a galaxy of phone torches. Lizzo, her DJ, Sophia Eris, and her bevy of plus-size dancers have been touring this album in venues and on television shows nonstop all year, and it is all hugely, cathartically entertaining \u2013 a big, warm, slightly rude hug of a night out. Lizzo hops naturally from hip-hop to funk to pop and back again \u2013 like Janelle Mon\u00e1e, she is one of those convincingly genre-less artists \u2013 playing all of Cuz I Love You, and its preceding EP, Coconut Oil, but nothing older. Exactly How I Feel is one a number of funk tracks that reveals the years Lizzo spent in Minneapolis and her time recording with Prince. The title track \u2013 \u201cAhm CRYING, cuz I LOOOOOOOOOOVE YEEEEEEWWWWW!\u201d, it goes \u2013 contains enough energy to run a server farm mining cryptocurrency. Long before Emma Watson said anything about self-partnering, Lizzo was singing about not only \u201cfeeling herself\u201d but marrying herself too. Amid the wall-to-wall bangers, a few questions surface. Lizzo performs without a band, and while singing to backing tracks is not rare at this level, it is a shame. The funk and the horns and the nimble, three-dimensional musicality of Lizzo\u2019s album deserve musicians of flesh and blood. There is also the small matter of the way this latest, most mainstream iteration of Lizzo centres on her sexuality. As liberating as the carefree jiggle is intended to be, a little of Lizzo\u2019s intelligence, nuance and versatility is eclipsed by all the twerking going on. There is a clear line from Aretha Franklin\u2019s Respect (which Lizzo quotes tonight) via Whitney Houston\u2019s Greatest Love of All through to Lizzo\u2019s music, and you can\u2019t help but feel self-actualisation shouldn\u2019t really be confused with wearing lingerie. But these are minor distractions. Good as Hell, given a second wind by an Ariana Grande remix, is as terrific tonight as its title. Although Missy Elliott, another Melissa who pioneered plus-size self-affirmation a generation ago, is not in the building, the track Tempo (on which she guests) stands out as one of Lizzo\u2019s most convincing of the night, reverberating around the venue. It links the major-label Lizzo of 2019 with the rude, funny rapper she used to be. Elliott was Lizzo\u2019s role model, the first person who made Lizzo feel \u201cseen\u201d.

It puts me to shame when I go into a nail bar and the technicians can speak five languages. I lose my temper when I get frustrated, but usually only with the people I love. I did lose my temper twice at Vogue \u2013 both times with men. Are Anna Wintour and I on each other\u2019s Christmas card list? I don\u2019t think either of us sends Christmas cards. So no. My relationship with my son Sam [24, from her marriage to writer Paul Spike] is my greatest life achievement. He\u2019s an art historian and we\u2019re really close. I became a single mum during my time at Vogue and considered giving the job up so I could be around more when he was small. But when I weighed everything up it didn\u2019t really make sense.

Being asked to join the Nike Oregon Project, a prestigious running program led by famed track coach Alberto Salazar, seemed like the next step to world domination.</p> <p>But Cain\u2019s immense talent wasn\u2019t nurtured in Oregon \u2013 it was starved. In a heartbreaking <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/opinion/nike-running-mary-cain.html\">video op-ed for the New York Times</a>, Cain, now 23, describes how the \u201call-male Nike staff became convinced that in order for me to get better, I had to become thinner, and thinner, and thinner.\u201d Salazar would publicly shame Cain about her weight and tell her she was too large.</p> <p>In response Cain started to obsess over her weight. As her body fat plummeted so did her estrogen levels. She didn\u2019t get her period for three years and she broke five bones. (Low estrogen affects bone density.) She became depressed and started cutting herself. Eventually she left the Oregon project. The project itself, by the way, was shut down a month ago after Salazar was embroiled in a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/01/766061205/nike-coach-alberto-salazar-is-hit-with-4-year-doping-ban\">doping scandal</a>.</p> <p>Cain\u2019s story is horrific but, unfortunately, it\u2019s not unusual.

It can\u2019t be emphasized enough that what happened to Cain isn\u2019t the result of a few toxic coaches, it\u2019s a systemic issue in women\u2019s sports.

The company is also facing a federal lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/10/nike-lawsuit-women-gender-discrimination\">alleging it violated equal pay laws</a>.</p> <p>So enough with the expensive ads, Nike.

After a three-year wait his request was granted in July 1989. \u201cAs a 24-year-old I was ready for the west,\u201d he says. Like everyone else he had little idea what would happen in just four months\u2019 time. I ask him where in the west he wanted to go. \u201cTo West Berlin,\u201d he replies. On the eve of the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Andreas\u2019s team Berliner FC Dynamo is in west Berlin, playing away in a Regionalliga Nordost fixture in the German fourth division. Home to FC Viktoria 1889 Berlin, the Lichterfelde stadium is just 10 miles from the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in the north-east, where Berliner FC Dynamo plays. It\u2019s easy to draw a line through the city from one ground to the other, but this is a Berlin derby that couldn\u2019t have happened 30 years ago.

      "body": "<p>The collaborative photo-storytelling project Through Positive Eyes chronicles a very particular moment in the global Aids epidemic, when effective treatment is available to some but not all, and when the enduring stigma associated with HIV and Aids has become entrenched \u2013 a major roadblock to both prevention and treatment. Over 10 years, more than 130 HIV-positive people across five continents have taken part, many of whom picked up cameras for the first time in their lives. Here they tell their stories, in words and in photographs.</p> <h2>\u2018My years with HIV have taught me to be more humble\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Alejandro, Mexico City, Mexico</strong></p> <p>I have been living with HIV for 15 years. The afternoon I got the news, I was in shock. I left the doctor\u2019s office and wandered aimlessly in the streets, all night long. When I finally came to my senses, it was dawn.</p> <p>I decided to fight to remain in the best physical, emotional and psychological condition I could, during the time I had left. I promised myself that the virus would never defeat me. I decided to be tough.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter if the virus came in to my life, or if I went looking for it. I am an electrician, and I live like anybody else. I love to exercise, not only because it is good for me, but also because I always wanted to have the body of a wrestler.</p> <p>The years I have spent living with HIV have taught me to be more humble, respectful and humane. My greatest satisfaction now is to help other people get medical care. We who live with HIV do not ask for special privileges, only that our rights be respected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Mexico%E2%80%99s%20Aids%20epidemic%20in%20numbers&amp;standfirst=&amp;number-1=170k&amp;field-1=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%202008%20&amp;number-2=230k&amp;field-2=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%202019&amp;number-3=2003&amp;field-3=Universal%20access%20given%20to%20antiretroviral%20drugs&amp;number-4=20.7%25&amp;field-4=HIV%20prevalence%20(men%20who%20have%20sex%20with%20men)%20&amp;number-5=70%25&amp;field-5=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20who%20are%20on%20treatment&amp;number-6=63%25&amp;field-6=Number%20of%20these%20who%20are%20virally%20suppressed&amp;number-7=&amp;field-7=&amp;number-8=&amp;field-8=\" data-alt=\"Mexico's Aids epidemic in numbers\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Mexico%E2%80%99s%20Aids%20epidemic%20in%20numbers&standfirst=&number-1=170k&field-1=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%202008%20&number-2=230k&field-2=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%202019&number-3=2003&field-3=Universal%20access%20given%20to%20antiretroviral%20drugs&number-4=20.7%25&field-4=HIV%20prevalence%20(men%20who%20have%20sex%20with%20men)%20&number-5=70%25&field-5=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20who%20are%20on%20treatment&number-6=63%25&field-6=Number%20of%20these%20who%20are%20virally%20suppressed&number-7=&field-7=&number-8=&field-8=\">Mexico's Aids epidemic in numbers</a> </figure>  <h2>\u2018The medication has changed my body: I look like a monster\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Aoy, Bangkok, Thailand</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8330ecb0c83e4cba6b26a6419db98e8d26eb9a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8330ecb0c83e4cba6b26a6419db98e8d26eb9a7/0_38_4608_2829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aoy, from Bangkok, Thailand, lying on a bed, one of a series of self-portraits by people living with HIV\" width=\"1000\" height=\"614\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aoy: \u2018I was shocked and worried that people would judge me.\u2019 Photograph: Aoy, courtesy of the UCLA Art &amp; Global Health Centre, with thanks to unaids.org</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Crispin Hughes/Aoy/Courtesy of the UCLA Art &amp; Global Health Centre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I became infected with HIV 10 years ago, when I was 30, from sex with my boyfriend.

Some allude, metaphorically, to my journey with HIV. A man struck up a conversation in the changing room of my gym, asking me why so many of my tattoos reference the spiritual. And it dawned on me that the most common theme written across my body is my divine connection to love. Once upon a time, I believed HIV would prevent me from loving and being loved. This photo captures a brief moment when the divine nature of love blossomed between me and David.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=The%20UK%20Aids%20epidemic%20in%20numbers&amp;standfirst=&amp;number-1=101.2k&amp;field-1=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%202015&amp;number-2=101.6k&amp;field-2=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%202017&amp;number-3=%C2%A30&amp;field-3=Cost%20of%20treatment&amp;number-4=0.2%25&amp;field-4=HIV%20prevalence%20in%20adult%20population&amp;number-5=98%25&amp;field-5=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20who%20are%20on%20treatment&amp;number-6=97%25&amp;field-6=Number%20of%20these%20who%20were%20virally%20suppressed&amp;number-7=&amp;field-7=&amp;number-8=&amp;field-8=\" data-alt=\"The UK's Aids epidemic in numbers\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=The%20UK%20Aids%20epidemic%20in%20numbers&standfirst=&number-1=101.2k&field-1=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%202015&number-2=101.6k&field-2=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%202017&number-3=%C2%A30&field-3=Cost%20of%20treatment&number-4=0.2%25&field-4=HIV%20prevalence%20in%20adult%20population&number-5=98%25&field-5=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20who%20are%20on%20treatment&number-6=97%25&field-6=Number%20of%20these%20who%20were%20virally%20suppressed&number-7=&field-7=&number-8=&field-8=\">The UK's Aids epidemic in numbers</a> </figure>  <h2>\u2018My children know I have HIV.

I wondered how I would look after them, but realised I had to.</p> <p>In 2008, I was becoming thinner and weighed just 32kg [5st]. I suspected that there was something wrong, so I got my blood tested. The doctor said I had HIV. I don\u2019t know how I got it. I suspect it was via a doctor\u2019s contaminated injection needle. From 2004 to 2007, I spent most of my money on treatment. After selling my house, my money ran out. I had to tell the doctor that paying for medicine was difficult. He gave me a month\u2019s worth: I could not believe his kindness.</p> <p>That is how my life has been \u2013 spending all my money on medicine, taking pills and raising my children. I take care of the home and if I get time, do a little business. I buy and sell kerosene. I have not been ill in eight years and my weight is up to 55kg [8st 9lb], but I do not work. People help our family. We have a place to live, which my father built. </p> <p>My children know I have HIV. My daughter told me everyone takes medicine, and it is OK if I do. As for the people around me, I have not said anything to them. They think I have tuberculosis. My children are happy now. I got three of my daughters married, which is one stressful thing achieved. My son is in his last year of school, and in two to three years he will stand on his own feet.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I am alone. I don\u2019t have a partner. I fold my hands and accept this.

My mother has it, and one of the ways it can be passed on is from mother to child in the womb. Often people give me more sympathy than they give someone who contracted HIV through drug use or sex. They say it\u2019s not my fault and I didn\u2019t ask for it. But who asks for HIV? The only difference between me and other HIV-positive people is that I don\u2019t know life without it.</p> <p>I grew up thinking it was impossible for me to have a child. I failed to plan for my future because I couldn\u2019t imagine having one. As an adult, I began hearing about a decrease in mother-to-child HIV transmission, using a new treatment regimen. After consulting with my doctor, I made the decision to try [for a baby]. HIV is no longer terminal. It\u2019s a chronic treatable disease, like diabetes. So my doctor gave me the green light.</p> <p>In the past, doctors preferred a caesarean birth, to minimise blood sharing, but, following medical advice, I was able to have a natural birth. I wanted my child to have the best possible outcome, and that\u2019s how it turned out.</p> <p>I had prayed for a girl, and the ultrasound confirmed it. She would be the remixed version of myself, so I scrambled the letters of my own name, Lynnea, and created the most beautiful name I could imagine: Nae\u2019Lyn. Nae\u2019Lyn is my life. She\u2019s a happy, healthy, HIV-negative little girl. She\u2019s sassy, spunky and very opinionated. She sings in church. She remembers everything. She is the sweetest little girl I\u2019ve ever met. </p> <p>And here I am, looking forward to being an old woman, decades from now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=The%20US%20Aids%20epidemic%20in%20numbers&amp;standfirst=&amp;number-1=1m&amp;field-1=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%202011&amp;number-2=1.1m&amp;field-2=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%202016&amp;number-3=1996&amp;field-3=Antiretroviral%20therapy%20available&amp;number-4=20%25&amp;field-4=Getting%20the%20prophylactic%20drugs%20they%20need&amp;number-5=56%25&amp;field-5=Black%2FLatino%20gay%20men%20among%20new%20infections&amp;number-6=&amp;field-6=&amp;number-7=&amp;field-7=&amp;number-8=&amp;field-8=\" data-alt=\"The US Aids epidemic in numbers\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=The%20US%20Aids%20epidemic%20in%20numbers&standfirst=&number-1=1m&field-1=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%202011&number-2=1.1m&field-2=People%20living%20with%20HIV%20in%202016&number-3=1996&field-3=Antiretroviral%20therapy%20available&number-4=20%25&field-4=Getting%20the%20prophylactic%20drugs%20they%20need&number-5=56%25&field-5=Black%2FLatino%20gay%20men%20among%20new%20infections&number-6=&field-6=&number-7=&field-7=&number-8=&field-8=\">The US Aids epidemic in numbers</a> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I felt trapped in sex work.

      "bodyText": "The collaborative photo-storytelling project Through Positive Eyes chronicles a very particular moment in the global Aids epidemic, when effective treatment is available to some but not all, and when the enduring stigma associated with HIV and Aids has become entrenched \u2013 a major roadblock to both prevention and treatment. Over 10 years, more than 130 HIV-positive people across five continents have taken part, many of whom picked up cameras for the first time in their lives. Here they tell their stories, in words and in photographs. \u2018My years with HIV have taught me to be more humble\u2019 Alejandro, Mexico City, Mexico I have been living with HIV for 15 years. The afternoon I got the news, I was in shock. I left the doctor\u2019s office and wandered aimlessly in the streets, all night long. When I finally came to my senses, it was dawn. I decided to fight to remain in the best physical, emotional and psychological condition I could, during the time I had left. I promised myself that the virus would never defeat me. I decided to be tough. It doesn\u2019t matter if the virus came in to my life, or if I went looking for it. I am an electrician, and I live like anybody else. I love to exercise, not only because it is good for me, but also because I always wanted to have the body of a wrestler. The years I have spent living with HIV have taught me to be more humble, respectful and humane. My greatest satisfaction now is to help other people get medical care. We who live with HIV do not ask for special privileges, only that our rights be respected. \u2018The medication has changed my body: I look like a monster\u2019 Aoy, Bangkok, Thailand I became infected with HIV 10 years ago, when I was 30, from sex with my boyfriend. I was shocked and worried that people would judge me. But then I met a group of new friends living with HIV. I realised people with HIV can live for many years. And I thought, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I stay alive, too?\u201d I take my medicine and care for myself, both body and soul. That\u2019s why I\u2019m still here. I wish there were a cure, so that I didn\u2019t have to take my medication. Each medicine has a different side-effect. My body has changed. I do exercises to help get a better shape, to help reduce my lipodystrophy: body bulge is a common side-effect. I feel I look like a monster. I have a hump on my back, and a distended tummy. If we don\u2019t want people to stamp HIV on our foreheads, then we have to take better care of our appearance. Even though I\u2019m HIV positive, it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care about my personal beauty. I don\u2019t want society to see HIV as something pathetic. I don\u2019t want people to feel sorry for me. \u2018I used to believe HIV would prevent me from being loved\u2019 James, London, England In the early days of my diagnosis, I was afraid of transmitting the virus to partners. Sex was overshadowed by risk, the body a vessel for fear rather than joy. I am interested in depicting the body within a fledgling relationship, and what that means in the context of HIV; David, my partner in this picture, is not HIV positive. I want to represent my HIV within a broader context of human intimacy, as healthy, erotic and sensual, as playful and loving, as sacred and nurturing, because I am all of those things. I have a lot of tattoos. Some allude, metaphorically, to my journey with HIV. A man struck up a conversation in the changing room of my gym, asking me why so many of my tattoos reference the spiritual. And it dawned on me that the most common theme written across my body is my divine connection to love. Once upon a time, I believed HIV would prevent me from loving and being loved. This photo captures a brief moment when the divine nature of love blossomed between me and David. \u2018My children know I have HIV. My neighbours think it is tuberculosis\u2019 Sudesh, Mumbai, India In 2005, my wife died \u2013 of non-Aids-related causes \u2013 and I thought, \u201cWhat have I got in life other than misfortune?\u201d I distanced myself from everyone and was very worried that my children did not have a mother. I wondered how I would look after them, but realised I had to. In 2008, I was becoming thinner and weighed just 32kg [5st]. I suspected that there was something wrong, so I got my blood tested. The doctor said I had HIV. I don\u2019t know how I got it. I suspect it was via a doctor\u2019s contaminated injection needle. From 2004 to 2007, I spent most of my money on treatment. After selling my house, my money ran out. I had to tell the doctor that paying for medicine was difficult. He gave me a month\u2019s worth: I could not believe his kindness. That is how my life has been \u2013 spending all my money on medicine, taking pills and raising my children. I take care of the home and if I get time, do a little business. I buy and sell kerosene. I have not been ill in eight years and my weight is up to 55kg [8st 9lb], but I do not work. People help our family. We have a place to live, which my father built. My children know I have HIV. My daughter told me everyone takes medicine, and it is OK if I do. As for the people around me, I have not said anything to them. They think I have tuberculosis. My children are happy now. I got three of my daughters married, which is one stressful thing achieved. My son is in his last year of school, and in two to three years he will stand on his own feet. Meanwhile, I am alone. I don\u2019t have a partner. I fold my hands and accept this. This is my life, and my life will go on. \u2018I prayed for a girl: she is happy, healthy, HIV negative\u2019 Lynnea, Los Angeles, US When you\u2019re a person living with HIV, you need your friends \u2013 to get past the stigma and to share moments of genuine love. I think I was born with HIV. My mother has it, and one of the ways it can be passed on is from mother to child in the womb. Often people give me more sympathy than they give someone who contracted HIV through drug use or sex. They say it\u2019s not my fault and I didn\u2019t ask for it. But who asks for HIV? The only difference between me and other HIV-positive people is that I don\u2019t know life without it. I grew up thinking it was impossible for me to have a child. I failed to plan for my future because I couldn\u2019t imagine having one. As an adult, I began hearing about a decrease in mother-to-child HIV transmission, using a new treatment regimen. After consulting with my doctor, I made the decision to try [for a baby]. HIV is no longer terminal. It\u2019s a chronic treatable disease, like diabetes. So my doctor gave me the green light. In the past, doctors preferred a caesarean birth, to minimise blood sharing, but, following medical advice, I was able to have a natural birth. I wanted my child to have the best possible outcome, and that\u2019s how it turned out. I had prayed for a girl, and the ultrasound confirmed it. She would be the remixed version of myself, so I scrambled the letters of my own name, Lynnea, and created the most beautiful name I could imagine: Nae\u2019Lyn. Nae\u2019Lyn is my life. She\u2019s a happy, healthy, HIV-negative little girl. She\u2019s sassy, spunky and very opinionated. She sings in church. She remembers everything. She is the sweetest little girl I\u2019ve ever met. And here I am, looking forward to being an old woman, decades from now. \u2018I felt trapped in sex work. But the moment I found out I was pregnant, I stopped\u2019 Wideline, Port-au-Prince, Haiti I started sex work when I was 16. I felt trapped. It was hard, but I got used to the job. Sometimes clients get mad, but the boss would never let anyone hit you. If they are with you for a minute, they pay $10. From the moment I discovered I was pregnant, I stopped doing it. I found out I had HIV in January 2014. At first, I felt confused, because I had done a test that came out negative, then went back again and the test came back positive. Some people living with HIV feel isolated, but I see the world the same way I saw it before. My friends help me, and my boyfriend is there, too. I go to the hospital every month; they give me [HIV] medication, and other medication because I am pregnant. They say that if I take all the medicine, the baby has a big chance of not having HIV. When she grows up, I hope she will not do the same work I did. \u2018When I told my mother, she said: \u201cYou are positive? So what?\u201d\u2019 Bhekisisa, Johannesburg, South Africa When they told me that I was positive, I was not shocked. I knew my behaviour had been bad. I had many girlfriends. I was a playboy \u2013 you can see how handsome I am. But I was destroying my life. So I told myself it was time for me to change. I really wanted to live. I really love life. The same day I found out my HIV status, I went to my mother\u2019s house and told her. She didn\u2019t want to show me that she was sad, so she said, \u201cYou are positive? So what?\u201d I realised she was trying to tell me I didn\u2019t have to give up. So I started to think positively, to take medication, and pick up my life. I\u2019ve got two children in my current relationship, and I\u2019m living with three others. Their mothers just said, \u201cYou know what? Take care of these children.\u201d I\u2019m so happy that they are part of my life. My father didn\u2019t take care of me because of his many wives. I realise I used to be like him.

      "body": "<p>The air turns royally blue inside Peter Reid\u2019s home while Boris Johnson is on TV for prime minister\u2019s questions. The old Evertonian silences the Old Etonian \u2013 a feat he once achieved with a splenetic put-down rather than a mute button \u2013 and messages Adrian Heath about the Minnesota United coach\u2019s impending visit from the United States. Everton\u2019s title-winning team of 1984-85 are being reunited on Monday at a special presentation of a film about their successes under Howard Kendall. Reid\u2019s mood \u2013 and his language \u2013 is transformed by the thought of catching up with old friends and toasting an absent one.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a word that doesn\u2019t come out among players but it is a love,\u201d says Reid of his former Everton teammates. \u201cThat is a nice part of it. There is a love there and you cannot beat love. Even now when we meet up it is something I look forward to and it was a long, long time ago. But it is still there. We all met in the Hilton before Howard\u2019s funeral and it was emotional. But it was also warm. I was speaking at the funeral so I said I wouldn\u2019t drink. Andy Gray insisted the gaffer would want me to, so of course I did. People go on about the party time but we were dedicated professionals. Nothing got in the way of the games but when we partied, we partied.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/04/neville-southall-flak-sex-workers-lgbt-issues\">Neville Southall: \u2018I\u2019ve got a bit of flak because I stick up for sex workers\u2019 | Donald McRae</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everton had regular cause to celebrate from 1984-87 as two league titles, the FA Cup and the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup made their way to Goodison Park. The dramatic rise of Kendall\u2019s young team, one that was in the doldrums and prompting calls for the manager\u2019s dismissal months before reaching the League and FA Cup finals, is covered in <em>Howard\u2019s Way</em>, a captivating film by Rob Sloman. The music and politics of the era feature heavily (including the Everton squad singing Here We Go on <em>Wogan</em>) but it is the bond between the club\u2019s most successful manager and those who played or worked for him that lies at the heart of the film. The former Everton player, coach and manager Colin Harvey\u2019s reflection on the sudden death of Kendall in 2015 is a deeply moving moment.</p> <p>Reid, the PFA Player of the Year in 1985, recalls: \u201cOne of my best moments in football was seeing Howard\u2019s smile as I came down the steps at Wembley with my FA Cup winner\u2019s medal [in 1984]. It was the best smile and one of my abiding memories in football. Five months earlier cushions were getting thrown on the pitch at Goodison Park. Five months. I think he is revered in football history. His achievements as a manager are up there.</p> <p>\u201cPeople say he was one of the best players never to win an England cap. If you go to Bilbao he is still revered there. That is my favourite other European team, not because Howard managed it, although that is part of it, but because of the ethos of the club with its Basque-only players and the tradition that surrounds it. There is something about [Athletic] Bilbao and Howard was the \u2018Mister\u2019 there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5b3e6cb52e1fd8f52601a9e20e4bd18f6cd81df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5b3e6cb52e1fd8f52601a9e20e4bd18f6cd81df/0_79_3232_1939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Reid, third left in the back row, celebrates the 1984 FA Cup final victory with his Everton teammates.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Reid, third left in the back row, celebrates the 1984 FA Cup final victory with his Everton teammates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI played in Bilbao in a pre-season game with Man City and it was an honour to play there. I\u2019ve been lucky to travel the world and meet a lot of people through football. At my first club [Bolton] Jimmy Armfield was manager and Nat Lofthouse was his assistant. Howard once took me to lunch with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. That was quite boozy and it was warm. It was always a warm occasion with Howard. But lunch with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, wow. Football has given me a lot and this team, the era that the film captures, was the pinnacle of it.

      "bodyText": "The air turns royally blue inside Peter Reid\u2019s home while Boris Johnson is on TV for prime minister\u2019s questions. The old Evertonian silences the Old Etonian \u2013 a feat he once achieved with a splenetic put-down rather than a mute button \u2013 and messages Adrian Heath about the Minnesota United coach\u2019s impending visit from the United States. Everton\u2019s title-winning team of 1984-85 are being reunited on Monday at a special presentation of a film about their successes under Howard Kendall. Reid\u2019s mood \u2013 and his language \u2013 is transformed by the thought of catching up with old friends and toasting an absent one. \u201cIt\u2019s a word that doesn\u2019t come out among players but it is a love,\u201d says Reid of his former Everton teammates. \u201cThat is a nice part of it. There is a love there and you cannot beat love. Even now when we meet up it is something I look forward to and it was a long, long time ago. But it is still there. We all met in the Hilton before Howard\u2019s funeral and it was emotional. But it was also warm. I was speaking at the funeral so I said I wouldn\u2019t drink. Andy Gray insisted the gaffer would want me to, so of course I did. People go on about the party time but we were dedicated professionals. Nothing got in the way of the games but when we partied, we partied.\u201d Everton had regular cause to celebrate from 1984-87 as two league titles, the FA Cup and the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup made their way to Goodison Park. The dramatic rise of Kendall\u2019s young team, one that was in the doldrums and prompting calls for the manager\u2019s dismissal months before reaching the League and FA Cup finals, is covered in Howard\u2019s Way, a captivating film by Rob Sloman. The music and politics of the era feature heavily (including the Everton squad singing Here We Go on Wogan) but it is the bond between the club\u2019s most successful manager and those who played or worked for him that lies at the heart of the film. The former Everton player, coach and manager Colin Harvey\u2019s reflection on the sudden death of Kendall in 2015 is a deeply moving moment. Reid, the PFA Player of the Year in 1985, recalls: \u201cOne of my best moments in football was seeing Howard\u2019s smile as I came down the steps at Wembley with my FA Cup winner\u2019s medal [in 1984]. It was the best smile and one of my abiding memories in football. Five months earlier cushions were getting thrown on the pitch at Goodison Park. Five months. I think he is revered in football history. His achievements as a manager are up there. \u201cPeople say he was one of the best players never to win an England cap. If you go to Bilbao he is still revered there. That is my favourite other European team, not because Howard managed it, although that is part of it, but because of the ethos of the club with its Basque-only players and the tradition that surrounds it. There is something about [Athletic] Bilbao and Howard was the \u2018Mister\u2019 there. \u201cI played in Bilbao in a pre-season game with Man City and it was an honour to play there. I\u2019ve been lucky to travel the world and meet a lot of people through football. At my first club [Bolton] Jimmy Armfield was manager and Nat Lofthouse was his assistant. Howard once took me to lunch with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. That was quite boozy and it was warm. It was always a warm occasion with Howard. But lunch with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, wow. Football has given me a lot and this team, the era that the film captures, was the pinnacle of it. I played in a World Cup and for a Liverpool lad from Huyton that is fantastic, but that team was the pinnacle.\u201d Football provided a glorious release from mass unemployment and political turmoil for the city of Liverpool in the mid-1980s, as the film captures. Reid does not recall the Everton changing room being particularly politically active but several players who emerged from it are unmistakably so today. Neville Southall, \u201cthe best goalkeeper in the world at that time\u201d, says Reid, and Gary Lineker are prominent voices on social media and the former midfielder himself last year addressed a People\u2019s Vote rally where he was scathing of Vote Leave leaders. \u201cThe way I look at it is there is enough in this world for everyone to be looked after,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere are wealthy people in the world and I don\u2019t have a problem with that.

I can\u2019t change it but I can voice an opinion on it and the people who can change it have not done a good job. \u201cI thought the referendum was corrupt.

Anyone who says they did is a liar or Einstein and I don\u2019t see many Einsteins out there. \u201cCarole Cadwalladr [the Observer and Guardian journalist] has got into Cambridge Analytica, Facebook and the financing of it from [US billionaire Robert] Mercer to [Steve] Bannon.

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrats have said the party is considering court action over Jo Swinson\u2019s exclusion from a BBC election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. The corporation announced on Friday that it would host a traditional head-to-head debate between the prime minister and Labour leader on 6 December. Swinson had said earlier in the week that her party would take legal action if ITV did not include her in its own leaders\u2019 debate, scheduled for 19 November. Layla Moran, the Lib Dems\u2019 education spokeswoman and Oxford West and Abingdon candidate, said it was critical the TV debates had a remain voice. She told Sky News: \u201cWe are the biggest, strongest remain party fielding candidates in all parts of the UK and actually we are the only party that can challenge Labour and the Conservatives on this. \u201cWe are in discussions with lawyers about what we are going to do with the ITV debate and we are also looking at court action for the BBC one too.\u201d Moran said it was \u201centirely possible\u201d that Swinson could be prime minister. \u201cI think in this election \u2013 and no one is saying this isn\u2019t a huge mountain to climb, no one is pretending that it is not \u2013 but what we did see is that in the European [elections] \u2013 different electoral system, I get it \u2013 but we polled higher than the Conservatives and the Labour party for the first time in 100 years. \u201cThere is something weird happening in British politics right now.

      "bodyText": "Only six candidates turned out for the first ever presidential forum on environmental justice at South Carolina State University on Friday night. Issues such as lead-contaminated water, food deserts, childhood asthma and proximity to polluting chemical plants and industrial pig farms disproportionately affect low-income communities, tribal nations and people of colour. The Democratic candidates who participated were Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker; former members of Congress John Delaney and Joe Sestak; the billionaire Tom Steyer; and the author Marianne Williamson. Warren, who launched an ambitious climate and environmental justice plan last month, said a third of the $3tn she has pledged to spend combating global heating over the next decade would be ring fenced for communities devastated by generations of environmental racism. She pledged to tackle big corporations including big polluters by introducing anti-corruption legislation on her first day as president. Asked about Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recently leaked comment that a Warren presidency would \u201csuck\u201d for the company, she responded: \u201cBoo-hoo.\u201d Steyer, the hedge-fund manager turned environmental philanthropist who bankrolled an \u201cimpeach Trump\u201d ad campaign, said he would declare a state of emergency on his first day in office to tackle the climate crisis. He compared current environmental inequalities to Jim Crow segregation laws implemented after the abolition of slavery, when people of color and native Americans had inadequate and inferior public services. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to repair these injustices, the people affected have to be at the front of the line for green jobs,\u201d said Steyer. The Flint water scandal in 2014 propelled environmental inequalities on to the national stage. Since then, it has emerged that thousands of water sources in communities across the US are contaminated with lead. This includes Newark, New Jersey, where Booker was mayor. He pledged to fund a national programme to replace lead pipes. The New Jersey senator, who founded the first environmental justice caucus, is vegan, because of what he says to the cruel and polluting \u201ccorporate animal industry\u201d responsible for massive greenhouse gas emissions and health problems in nearby communities. Booker defended supporting nuclear power, a position criticized by environmental justice groups given the health risks posed by nuclear waste, arguing that it was the only way to meet climate targets within 12 years. \u201cFifty percent of our non-carbon energy producing capacity come from nuclear,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m a realist.\u201d Delaney, a former congressman from Maryland, said cutting carbon emissions to net zero by 2030 would be impossible under the Green New Deal, a broad social and economic pact supported by high-profile Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The deal plans legislation to achieve universal healthcare and higher minimum wages as well as clean energy, sustainable infrastructure and green jobs. Delaney said he wants to cancel fossil-fuel tax subsidies, freeing up money to invest in technology to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The environmental justice forum was hosted by the National Black Caucus of State Legislators and leaders from frontline and tribal communities, civil rights, youth and environmental organizations. It was moderated by Mustafa Santiago Ali, a former Environmental Protection Agency official, and Amy Goodman from the independent news organization Democracy Now. The caucus will host a forum on gun violence and mental health next month. This article was amended on 9 November 2019. It originally said John Delaney said cutting carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 would not be possible. In fact, he said 2030.",

It doesn\u2019t dominate my life but it will never leave me. You could commentate on sport your whole life and never get a moment like that. My voice will be there for ever, I guess. It\u2019s an honour \u2026 I just hope I got it right.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is in keeping with Smith\u2019s nature, as warm off the air as on it, that he should question this: the 62-year-old former wicketkeeper may be considered by his peers (and this particular admirer) to sit among the elite of his profession but, like Kane Williamson\u2019s \u201cbeaten\u201d finalists, there is little ego to go with it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over\">England win Cricket World Cup after super-over drama against New Zealand</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet it is fair to say that, just as Jofra Archer, Jason Roy and Jos Buttler somehow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over\" title=\"\">held their nerve</a> come that final heart-stopping delivery \u2013 the run-out of Martin Guptill to leave the super over all square, but England winners via the little-known boundary countback tie-breaker \u2013 so too did Smith.</p> \n<p><em>This is the moment: it\u2019s Archer to Guptill. Two to win. Guptill\u2019s going to push for two. They\u2019ve got to go. It\u2019s \u2026 the throw\u2019s got to go to the keeper\u2019s end! HE\u2019S GOT IT! England have won the World Cup by the barest of margins. By the barest of all margins. Absolute ecstasy for England, agony, agony for New Zealand\u2026</em></p> \n<p>The words are now part of cricket history. Smith, who along with his co-commentators Nasser Hussain and Ian Bishop had seen a final seven-over stint on air morph into 80 minutes of the most volatile sporting drama imaginable, had one shot and, for my money, nailed it.</p> \n<p>\u201cNone of us in the box could believe what we had just been a part of. I went back to my hotel, the Danubius across the road, with Simon Doull [another former New Zealand player]. We chatted to fans on the way, I had four pints in about 50 minutes and then slept through till morning. I was drained. And I was just so disappointed for the New Zealand players. It was their time \u2026 but it wasn\u2019t. We never lost the game. We just didn\u2019t win it.\u201d</p> \n<p>At this point Smith gives a slightly misty-eyed look in the direction of the mountain in the distance. As a player he was part of the New Zealand team defeated by Pakistan in the 1992 World Cup semi-final; as a commentator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/29/australia-new-zealand-world-cup-final\" title=\"\">in 2015</a> and the summer just gone, he has twice called losing finals for the Black Caps. Yet any such thoughts were typically kept in check on air despite being \u201cchurned up\u201d inside and having to stand throughout. \u201cI get a wee bit of criticism in this country for not being pro-New Zealand,\u201d says Smith, a veteran of around 160 All Blacks Tests, including two more successful finals. \u201cBut I consider myself to be a commentator from New Zealand, not a New Zealand commentator. That helps you keep an open mind and definitely helped me that day at Lord\u2019s.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"70b45c78-d793-4f11-9df7-dfcce4d844b1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DmY_73eRACA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It was needed given a cascade of sliding doors moments that one by one went against Williamson\u2019s players, such as Trent Boult catching man-of-the-match Ben Stokes at long-on with nine balls to go, only for his back foot to hit the boundary rope. \u201cTrent is such a brilliant outfielder and he usually swallows those.

But it didn\u2019t work like that. New Zealand knew they had to get 16. It is what it is. I saw their faces at the time and there was disappointment \u2013 but no anger \u2013 and then some pretty good grace. From both sides, really.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was in admiration of the players given the pressure they were under. Take Jason Roy. He had misfielded and thrown to the wrong end in the super over but still delivered. And Jos Buttler at the stumps.

Sky Sports New Zealand has lost the rights to cricket after this season and, given his continuing role for the broadcaster in rugby, the current series could well be his last covering cricket at home.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/08/aaron-finch-australia-thrashing-pakistan-third-t20-series-win-cricket\">Aaron Finch leads Australia thrashing of Pakistan to seal 2-0 T20 series win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI started playing in \u201975, went straight into the commentary box: Christmas next year could be my first not working in 45 by the time I get there.

      "body": "<p>So deep, so minimal was the Southbank Centre\u2019s second <strong>Deep Minimalism</strong> weekend (the first was in 2016), it was almost impossible to know in advance what was on offer. The website gave few clues beyond promising some 13 hours of \u201cmeditative listening and deep concentration\u201d delivered by various experimental composers-performers \u2013 among them the flautist <a href=\"http://www.kathryngwilliams.com/coming-up-for-air.html\" title=\"\">Kathryn Williams</a>, whose <em>Coming Up for Air</em> consists of 40 tiny pieces \u201cfor a single breath\u201d, and medieval violin and double pipe player <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkM120iL9FQ\" title=\"\">Laura Cannell</a>, who draws on early music and folk to create her arresting improvisations. The opaqueness of the timetable may have been part of the appeal. Plenty of people attended the sessions I went to, in the Purcell Room or Queen Elizabeth Hall.</p> <p>One thing you learn, quite quickly, listening to the French composer \u00e9liane Radigue\u2019s best-known work, <em>Trilogie de la Mort</em> (1988-93), is that either you have a knack for zoning in to her sound world, or you do not. The pioneering <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/8983993\" title=\"\">Radigue</a> (b1932) was one of the few women to experiment with electronics in Paris in the 1950s, cutting, splicing, slowing down sounds and stretching small sonic cells into shadowy oscillation and abstract epic. Now in her late 80s, she was awarded the \u20ac10,000 Giga-Hertz award 2019 only last month. She has been praised as an artist whose compositions touch audiences via their \u201cunique forms of empathy, understanding and introspection\u201d.</p> <p>Introspection is key. The <em>Trilogie</em>, a three-hour elegy for her son, is inspired by <em>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</em>. The noises, recreated digitally by the composer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rxe1yqIMiY\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Holterbach</a>, shuddered through you from surrounding speakers, at times like slow engine or propeller sounds, at others emerging as bells or drones, quivering with overtones. I\u2019d read a description saying that if you are not a deep listener, all you will hear is a hum. Timbres and patterns of sound emerged, but I was unable to reach the meditative state of many of those around me, few of whom shared my need to fidget and sneak half-hourly checks on my watch. Yet some spirit of lament left its imprint. Next time I\u2019ll do better.</p> <p>Morton Feldman\u2019s <em>Triadic Memories </em>(1981), a scrap at only 90 minutes (and short for Feldman; his second string quartet lasts five hours), requires ferocious concentration and stamina from the solo pianist to keep the fluid structure poised and purposeful. Feldman compared it to \u201cthe biggest butterfly in captivity\u201d, which gives you an idea of the work\u2019s beauty, its quietude and its slow-fluttering delicacy. <a href=\"http://www.elizamccarthy.com/\" title=\"\">Eliza McCarthy</a>, American-born, trained in the UK, was a model of restraint and attentiveness. In comparison, <em><a href=\"https://mmmmalibu.bandcamp.com/album/one-life-2\" title=\"\">One Life</a></em> by the French composer Malibu, in an arrangement for 16 cellos with electronics, directed and co-arranged by Oliver Coates, played by the London Contemporary Orchestra, was a gorgeous wash of ambient sounds, complete with crashing waves and disembodied voices. </p> <p>Also in an arrangement by Coates, these massed cellos played <em>Canticles of the Sky</em> (2007) by the American composer and environmentalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/30/john-luther-adams-composer-become-ocean\" title=\"\">John Luther Adams</a>, who spent many years in Alaska, writing in a cabin in the woods. Through long, lush string textures played legato, the <em>Canticles</em> attempt to capture in sound the low angle of the sun in the Arctic sky, with its strange halos and illusions of multiple suns. If meditative listening is allowed a climax, this was it.</p> <p>Another American composer called Adams represents a more familiar tradition of minimalism. The<strong> Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra</strong> played John Adams\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.earbox.com/city-noir/\" title=\"\">City Noir</a></em> (2009), written like an imaginary film score to evoke the mood and ambience of Los Angeles noir films of the 1940s and 1950s. This was a significant undertaking for the BSO and conductor Kirill Karabits, requiring a large orchestra with quadrupled woodwind, alto saxophone, five percussionists and a jazz drummer, as well as piano, celesta and two harps and endless calls for solo virtuosity. They played with zest and swagger, hurtling with flamboyance towards the big-band-style finale. The sorrow was that the audience in Basingstoke that night, for a strong programme that included Sibelius\u2019s Violin Concerto played with soul, finesse and technical wizardry by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB0r4FNmhBw\" title=\"\">Valeriy Sokolov</a>, was so small. Luckily the same concert in Poole the previous night had a strong turnout.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"292c08775020955de2bd3df7d833c836c80c1722\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/292c08775020955de2bd3df7d833c836c80c1722/0_0_4424_2931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vito Priante as Papageno and Elsa Dreisig as Pamina in Die Zauberfl\u00f6te at the Royal Opera House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vito Priante as Papageno and Elsa Dreisig as Pamina in Die Zauberfl\u00f6te at the Royal Opera House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even in its seventh revival, David McVicar\u2019s tenebrous, beautiful and probing production of Mozart\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/the-magic-flute-by-david-mcvicar-details\" title=\"\">Die Zauberfl\u00f6te</a></strong> for the Royal Opera feels fresh, not least because of a new lineup of talent in lead roles (heard on second night).

At the age of 33 he is resigned to finishing his international career on 66 caps. \u201cIt was disappointing to miss the World Cup but it was out of your control,\u201d said the Harlequins captain, who will lead his side at Clermont Auvergne on Saturday evening in their second Champions Cup campaign in five years. \u201cWhen you look at how well the two flankers played you cannot argue. Tom Curry and Sam Underhill were both brilliant, England\u2019s players of the tournament I thought. Their form made it a bit easier to take. \u201cYou look at the guys coming through in the back row, Jack Willis, Alex Dombrandt, Zach Mercer, Will Evans and Ted Hill, and they are the future. Much as I would like to say there will be another opportunity for me, I do not think so. It is tough to take but you have to look back and think what you have done in the white shirt and the honour I had of captaining the side as many times as I did. You just want one more chance.\u201d Harlequins have not reached the knockout stage of the Champions Cup since 2013, although since then they have reached the Challenge Cup final and made the last four in it last season, when they lost narrowly to their opponents on Saturday, Clermont, in France. \u201cWe are in a tough group with Bath and Ulster but it is not easy for anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not think there is any better place to start the tournament in than Clermont. We know what to expect having been there earlier this year and then we have Bath at home. We have waited for this opportunity for a while and we do not want to be a passenger in the group. \u201cIt is easier said than done but it is time for all the English clubs in the tournament, not just Saracens, to do their bit in Europe. The rest of us need to start making the most of being in the competition.\u201d The World Cup means a later start to the Champions Cup this season. Pool matches will be played 15\u201117 Nov, 22-24 Nov, 6-8 Dec, 13-15 Dec, 10-12 Jan, 17-19 Jan. The quarter-finals will be played 3-5 April 2020, semi-finals 2-3 May and the Marseille final on 23 May. Pool 1 Benetton, Leinster, Lyon, Northampton Pool 2 Exeter, Glasgow, La Rochelle, Sale Pool 3 Clermont Auvergne, Bath, Harlequins, Ulster Pool 4 Munster, Ospreys, Racing 92, Saracens Pool 5 Connacht, Gloucester, Montpellier, Toulouse",

Stir in the cornflour over a medium heat for a few minutes, until the mixture thickens. Continue to cook for a couple more minutes, until there is no graininess on tasting. Turn off the heat and stir through the sugar until dissolved, then add the egg yolks. With the heat on low, keep stirring until the clementine curd becomes a loose paste. Beat in the cold butter until smooth. To assemble the macarons, pipe a little of the curd on to one macaron shell, then sandwich together with another and repeat.",

It\u2019s right in your home town.</p> <p>Seattle is home to Amazon, one of the world\u2019s most powerful corporations, as well as to a city council that has tended to have troublesome ideas like \u201cthe trillion-dollar corporation led by America\u2019s richest man that is headquartered in our city should pay a tax to help house the <a href=\"https://www.seattlepi.com/homeless_in_seattle/article/New-count-shows-homelessness-in-King-County-13814567.php\">11,000</a> homeless people here\u201d. When the city council passed such a tax on Seattle\u2019s biggest businesses last year, it took Amazon less than a month to get it repealed, using <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/how-amazon-helped-kill-a-seattle-tax-on-business/562736/\">economic threats</a> and political spending. But that wasn\u2019t enough. For the city council elections this year, Amazon poured <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/five-things-to-know-about-seattles-crucial-city-council-elections-after-election-night/\">$1.5m</a> into a business-backed effort to elect a slate of friendly candidates. Though vote counting is still going on, it looks like Bezos and co fell short of their goal \u2013 the business slate picked up a seat, and the final tally <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/five-things-to-know-about-seattles-crucial-city-council-elections-after-election-night/\">may still show</a> they\u2019ve defeated their greatest enemy, socialist Kshama Sawant, but they did not succeed in seizing full control of the council.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An unfortunate truth is that political spending is a great investment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, any crowing by progressives about this minor speed bump in the path of capital is a bit too pat. The head tax that Amazon defeated would have cost the company more than $10m per year. They spent $1.5m on this election to pick up one or two seats. That is not a meaningful defeat for a company this powerful \u2013 it is a data point. At these prices, Amazon could happily spend, say, $7.5m on the next election and still come out ahead in terms of the financial risk they face from the left. The corporate thought process does not dictate that the company should now slink away chastened. It dictates that the company should spend <em>more</em> next time. Elections happen all the time, but the system remains stacked in Amazon\u2019s favor. Progressives will always have to expend vast amounts of energy organizing thousands and thousands of people to act in concert to maintain their tenuous hold on power. All corporations have to do is write a check. At this unequal work rate, one side is bound to get tired before the other.</p> <p>An unfortunate truth is that political spending is a great investment. The best, perhaps. Stocks and bonds might only earn you 10%, but gaining control of the levers of government power can multiply your investment unimaginably. That is true for companies avoiding local taxes in the cities where they\u2019re headquartered, and it is even more true the higher up you go in the government hierarchy. After every election cycle, we are treated to news stories portraying the (ever higher) amount of money spent on the races as a staggering sum. But that betrays a lack of perspective. The total cost of the 2016 national elections \u2013 meaning the race for the White House as well as all of Congress \u2013 was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/14/somebody-just-put-a-price-tag-on-the-2016-election-its-a-doozy/\">$6.5bn</a>. For a group that exercises total control over a federal budget of more than <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-federal-budget-breakdown-3305789\">$4tn</a>, that\u2019s a real bargain. </p> <p>While we commoners gape slack-jawed at nine zeroes in the spending column, business interests know that there are several more zeroes to be recouped on the other side of the elections. As long as this basic math holds true \u2013 and as long as our laws allow it \u2013 money will control politics. And since the return on investment is so grand, spending will only keep increasing. This is the raw logic of capitalism that can never be overcome as long as our set of rules stays as it is. So yes, we will have to drastically change our campaign finance laws if we want to begin to overcome the gravitational pull of wealth warping our democracy. But if we ever want to get serious about that dream of a political system that represents everyone, we will have to do something more definitive: take all the money away from the rich.</p> <ul> <li><p>Hamilton Nolan is a writer based in New York City</p></li> </ul>",

Though vote counting is still going on, it looks like Bezos and co fell short of their goal \u2013 the business slate picked up a seat, and the final tally may still show they\u2019ve defeated their greatest enemy, socialist Kshama Sawant, but they did not succeed in seizing full control of the council. Still, any crowing by progressives about this minor speed bump in the path of capital is a bit too pat. The head tax that Amazon defeated would have cost the company more than $10m per year. They spent $1.5m on this election to pick up one or two seats. That is not a meaningful defeat for a company this powerful \u2013 it is a data point. At these prices, Amazon could happily spend, say, $7.5m on the next election and still come out ahead in terms of the financial risk they face from the left. The corporate thought process does not dictate that the company should now slink away chastened. It dictates that the company should spend more next time. Elections happen all the time, but the system remains stacked in Amazon\u2019s favor. Progressives will always have to expend vast amounts of energy organizing thousands and thousands of people to act in concert to maintain their tenuous hold on power. All corporations have to do is write a check. At this unequal work rate, one side is bound to get tired before the other. An unfortunate truth is that political spending is a great investment. The best, perhaps. Stocks and bonds might only earn you 10%, but gaining control of the levers of government power can multiply your investment unimaginably. That is true for companies avoiding local taxes in the cities where they\u2019re headquartered, and it is even more true the higher up you go in the government hierarchy. After every election cycle, we are treated to news stories portraying the (ever higher) amount of money spent on the races as a staggering sum. But that betrays a lack of perspective. The total cost of the 2016 national elections \u2013 meaning the race for the White House as well as all of Congress \u2013 was $6.5bn. For a group that exercises total control over a federal budget of more than $4tn, that\u2019s a real bargain. While we commoners gape slack-jawed at nine zeroes in the spending column, business interests know that there are several more zeroes to be recouped on the other side of the elections. As long as this basic math holds true \u2013 and as long as our laws allow it \u2013 money will control politics. And since the return on investment is so grand, spending will only keep increasing. This is the raw logic of capitalism that can never be overcome as long as our set of rules stays as it is. So yes, we will have to drastically change our campaign finance laws if we want to begin to overcome the gravitational pull of wealth warping our democracy. But if we ever want to get serious about that dream of a political system that represents everyone, we will have to do something more definitive: take all the money away from the rich.

      "body": "<p>There was something not quite right about the two men struggling out of Hereford bus station on a blustery day in November 2015. The dark-haired one was wearing what appeared to be military fatigues; his much older companion seemed confused and barely able to walk. A concerned passerby went to help. The younger man, who seemed to have an American or Canadian accent, explained that he had found the older man face down on a country road and was taking him to Hereford county hospital. She walked with them, doing her best to support the faltering older man, who could not move more than a couple of paces unaided. As the three of them approached the turning to the hospital, she flagged down an ambulance. The paramedics suspected dementia and assessed the older man in the rear cabin; he seemed to be smiling and crying at the same time. He had no ID and could only give his first name, Roger.</p> <p>His companion, sitting opposite, told the crew the same story: he had found the man on the side of a road some distance from Credenhill, a village on the outskirts of Hereford. But he claimed he couldn\u2019t share his own contact details because he had been working at the nearby SAS base, and soon vanished into the early evening gloom.</p> <p>Little was as it seemed that Saturday. It was just the beginning of an extraordinary international mystery that for six months flummoxed the British authorities and generated headlines around the world. The truth only partially emerged earlier this year, when Simon Hayes, a 53-year-old personal trainer, was given a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/30/man-jailed-over-plot-to-dump-us-man-with-dementia-in-hereford\" title=\"\">two-and-a-half-year sentence for his </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/30/man-jailed-over-plot-to-dump-us-man-with-dementia-in-hereford\" title=\"\">role in a plot to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/30/man-jailed-over-plot-to-dump-us-man-with-dementia-in-hereford\" title=\"\">abandon Roger Curry</a>, an autistic American man with dementia, far from his home in Whittier, California. Hayes had driven Roger to Hereford the day after he had arrived, with the rest of the Curry family, on a flight from the US. The 78-year-old had been stripped of anything that could identity him, and dressed in brand new British supermarket clothes.</p> <p>Yet Hayes\u2019s motivations \u2013 and indeed much of the Curry family\u2019s backstory \u2013 remain a mystery. The judge at his trial, Daniel Pearce-Higgins, struggled to find any precedents for the case. Sentencing at Worcester crown court in April this year, he remarked: \u201cI cannot find any case remotely similar to the facts of this case, curiously because there appears to be no apparent benefit to the defendant.\u201d</p> <p>There is no evidence that money changed hands, or that Hayes benefited in any way. Why did he go to the lengths he did to help Roger\u2019s son, Kevin Curry, dump his father more than 5,000 miles from his US home? Is he \u2013 as the court heard \u2013 a convincing liar who stage-managed the British end of a plot to get the NHS to look after an unwanted relative? Or is he \u2013 as the court also heard \u2013 a tragic figure who took refuge in a fantasy world to protect himself from a turbulent life punctuated by loss?</p> <p>***</p> <p>It\u2019s July 2019 and Prisoner A1682EJ appears jittery as he is finally let into the cavernous visiting hall of HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire. Wearing a grey polo shirt and tracksuit bottoms, Simon Hayes shuffles one way, then the other. The G4S guards took no notice and for a few moments he waits awkwardly in the no man\u2019s land between the door and the seating area, perhaps because mine is his first visit after 10 weeks in jail.</p> <p>Once he is seated, I notice a red gash on his forehead and a graze on his cheek. He winces as he touches the split skin. \u201cI was slapped by my cellmate,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cI fell and I caught my head on the bed.\u201d Hayes\u2019s face is covered with a film of sweat, his eyes darting from side to side and his hands faintly shaking. He asks for a cold drink and some food to settle his nerves. \u201cThank you,\u201d he calls as I go to the kiosk. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back when I get out, mate.\u201d As he swigs from a Coke bottle and tucks into a ham sandwich, he says he is ready to talk. \u201cI\u2019m OK \u2013 when you\u2019ve been in the Marines, this is nothing,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"960c2d9dee4672cc978b6482d46dfaff3e2611df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/960c2d9dee4672cc978b6482d46dfaff3e2611df/0_96_1589_2000/795.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of Simon Hayes,  jailed for abandoning an elderly American man with dementia\" width=\"795\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Hayes, who was jailed for two and a half years for his part in the plot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SWNS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hayes says he got to know the Curry family after moving to the US to launch an offshoot of his motorsport coaching business in 2003. He was keen to make a fresh start following the loss of his adoptive mother, Anita, who died from cancer in 2001. \u201cWhen she was being treated, it was difficult,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI viewed Ken [his adoptive father] and Anita as my real parents and loved them very much \u2013 still do.\u201d He had also just recovered from a serious car accident, in which his hire car collided with a lorry near Silverstone racing circuit, where he had been training drivers. \u201cIt was a good opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cI was also trying to figure out what my mum\u2019s death meant to me. I felt I needed to get away.\u201d</p> <p>Hayes settled in Los Angeles and his business started to grow, with amateur and professional drivers based in the US seeking his help. He was introduced to Kevin Curry by a mutual acquaintance; the two men shared a fascination with Area 51, the US air force base in Nevada that has long been a focus of conspiracy theories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/area-51-raid-event-what-happened-nevada\" title=\"\">about alien spacecraft and extra</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/area-51-raid-event-what-happened-nevada\" title=\"\">terrestrials</a>. \u201cI have an interest in the unexplained,\u201d Hayes tells me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I believe that aliens exist.\u201d He claims Kevin\u2019s interest in Area 51 stemmed from his father\u2019s connection to the base. \u201cRoger served at Area 51 as an air force technician. His family were trying to get an explanation as to why his particular dementia deteriorated so abruptly,\u201d he says, implying a connection.</p> <p>Despite the age difference \u2013 Hayes was 44, Kevin 29 \u2013 the pair grew close. Hayes spent Christmas 2010 with Kevin, Roger, then 70, and his wife, Mary Jo, then 59, at their house in a middle-class suburb of LA. However, Hayes soon found that all was not well with the Curry family. Mary Jo had Parkinson\u2019s disease and was finding it increasingly hard to look after her husband who, according to Hayes, was already suffering from dementia. Kevin told him the family couldn\u2019t afford to put his father in a care home.</p> <p>\u201cI was being asked to help out with Roger \u2013 I could see that he was becoming harder to manage,\u201d Hayes recalls. He remembers that Mary Jo would struggle to lift Roger from his chair and that sometimes he would lash out. \u201cI know that, through no fault of his own, Roger was at times uncontrollably violent towards Mary Jo,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Hayes also had his own problems. He says his \u201ctumultuous\u201d marriage to an American woman \u2013 whom he had met and married soon after arriving in the country \u2013 broke down in 2011. Then, in 2013, he was arrested for drink-driving. Hayes claims he had a fight with another prisoner in a holding cell, which led to his deportation. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give him my sunglasses. We got into an altercation, and then they filed charges that I incited a riot. They revoked my visa and gave me a date to turn up at the airport,\u201d he says. </p> <p>His account doesn\u2019t fully tally with official records. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement says Hayes was deported for overstaying his visa after his arrest for \u201cdriving under the influence\u201d by California Highway Patrol in 2013. Hayes had entered the US in 2007 under the department\u2019s visa-waiver programme, which typically allows British citizens to come to the US on holiday or business for up to 90 days.</p> <p>Back in the UK, Hayes moved to Somerset to live with his father, Ken, in a mobile home park; Ken was 90 and in poor health. America, though, was still on Hayes\u2019s mind; he unsuccessfully applied for visas and stayed in regular contact with Kevin. \u201cHe was a friend who was going through a very stressful period,\u201d Hayes explains. \u201cI tried my best to be supportive.\u201d He says Kevin asked him to look into ways of bringing Roger to the UK, and admits that he researched possible British care homes, but insists he had no idea that Kevin was planning to dump his father here. \u201cRoger was getting worse. He was contemplating healthcare facilities in Mexico, Canada and the UK,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How did it feel to leave a confused, distressed old man? \u2018It was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve had to do\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2015, Kevin announced he would be coming to Europe on holiday with his children, while Roger and Mary Jo stayed in a respite home. He said he would be stopping off in the UK and invited his old friend to join him. \u201cI never take any time off, so I was excited to have a break,\u201d Hayes says. But when he went to meet Kevin at Gatwick airport, he claims he was shocked to see Roger and Mary Jo coming through the arrivals gate, too. \u201cRoger was in a wheelchair. He couldn\u2019t walk. Mary Jo looked exhausted. She could barely stand up. They had deteriorated since I had last seen them,\u201d he says. \u201cKevin told me that the hospital would not take them.\u201d</p> <p>That night they booked into the nearby Gatwick Marriott hotel. Hayes says Kevin asked him to take Roger to hospital, so they coud have their family holiday. Hayes says he felt sorry for Kevin and agreed. \u201cI said, \u2018Give yourselves a week and then pick your dad up, or make an arrangement with the authorities so that your dad can stay here and be financially supported by his insurance company,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I did not for one minute suggest or insinuate, in any way, shape or form, that he should be abandoned in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin booked a hire car, naming Hayes as an additional driver. In the morning, Hayes drove 157 miles to Hereford bus station, with Roger dressed in new clothes and stripped of his ID. This part of Hayes\u2019s account is particularly puzzling: if Roger was sick, why not choose a closer hospital? There were two \u2013 East Surrey and Crawley \u2013 within about six miles. Bizarrely, Hayes claims he chose Hereford hospital because he had visited it once before with a client and thought it \u201cwas more straightforward than driving all over London\u201d. He acknowledges that his decision \u201cseems odd\u201d, adding only that he was \u201csuffering from mental health issues\u201d that clouded his judgment.</p> <p>Did he know Roger had been stripped of anything that could identify him, and dressed in new clothes that would provide investigators with few clues? Hayes says not, but remembers that Kevin had borrowed his credit card to do some shopping before they left for Hereford. \u201cI had told Kevin: \u2018I\u2019m not a nurse. I\u2019m not responsible for dressing or anything else to do with your dad \u2013 I\u2019m offering to drive him to a safe, lawful location where he can get medical treatment, and that\u2019s it.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"813b292394cfa82d7c5df8997234d8f34218fd67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/813b292394cfa82d7c5df8997234d8f34218fd67/0_2512_4813_2888/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stonebow Road near Hereford, where Roger Curry was abandoned.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stonebow Road, where Roger Curry was abandoned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That afternoon, he parked in Hereford bus station and led Roger towards the hospital. Why did he tell the passerby and paramedics that he had found him face down in the countryside? \u201cI wanted to give the family some time\u2026 at least a week,\u201d he says sheepishly. How did it feel to leave a confused and distressed old man, without any medication or paperwork? Hayes hesitates, searching for the right words. \u201cIt was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve had to do,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I did it because I\u2019d seen the lack of care he got from his own country and government \u2013 a former veteran, I might add, which is disgraceful.\u201d</p> <p>Hayes returned to Gatwick and joined the rest of the Curry family on holiday in Copenhagen. They stayed in a city-centre hotel, but Mary Jo was in such poor health she rarely left it. Instead, Hayes says, he went for long walks with Kevin and they talked about Roger\u2019s future. \u201cIt was an odd holiday,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t relaxing. I felt uncomfortable with the situation I\u2019d been put in.\u201d</p> <p>Hayes left Copenhagen before the Currys. He contends that he had no idea Roger was left behind when Kevin and his mother later returned to the US. He says that when he spoke to Kevin in the weeks and months that followed, he was told Roger was back at home. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say he was lying to me\u2026\u201d he says, his voice trailing off, as if struggling to shake off some lingering loyalty to Kevin. \u201cHe misled me, whether it was for the right or the wrong reasons.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>So-called granny dumping \u2013 where families unable to afford or cope with their caring responsibilities offload elderly relatives on to hospitals \u2013 is not uncommon in the US. As far back as 1992, the American College of Emergency Physicians estimated that 70,000 elderly people were being abandoned each year. Dr Kevin Biese, an associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of North Carolina, says medical staff routinely encounter elderly people, with no pressing health needs, brought into emergency departments because their families cannot cope. \u201cFrequently we see the family saying their elderly relative \u2018had a fever yesterday\u2019 or \u2018chest pain\u2019, but what they\u2019re really saying is, \u2018We just can\u2019t take it\u2019,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Outright abandonments, where the family leave a relative unattended, are rarer, but still happen, especially in poorer areas. \u201cEvery emergency doctor has at least several patients a year where that is the case,\u201d Biese says. He blames the lack of support for caregivers in the US. \u201cThere is a tremendous burden placed on adult children,\u201d he says. Medicaid-funded facilities are available only to the very poorest older people. \u201cThese places are not where any of us would want to live. You might have 30 patients to one nursing assistant.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5811c5b3fbbc3f7c0032a010309a02c66899c123\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5811c5b3fbbc3f7c0032a010309a02c66899c123/16_699_6042_3626/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hereford bus station\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hayes drove Roger \u2013 in new clothes, with no ID \u2013 157 miles to Hereford bus station, before trying to walk him to the local hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to Age UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/09/million-older-people-england-badly-let-down-lack-social-care-funding-ageuk\" title=\"\">a record </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/09/million-older-people-england-badly-let-down-lack-social-care-funding-ageuk\" title=\"\">1.4 million older people</a> in England are not getting the support they need at home to carry out essential everyday tasks, such as getting out of bed and going to the toilet, because of the chronic underfunding of local social care services. Tom Gentry, the charity\u2019s senior health influencing manager, says some of these people are ending up in A&amp;E departments because their carers cannot cope. \u201cThese families are at the whip end of having to care for elderly relatives. Hospital is perceived to be the only option because the local authority isn\u2019t helping.\u201d</p> <p>Research by the charity has revealed that almost 1,000 over-65s are needlessly admitted to hospital every month. Gentry says doctors even have medical terms for admitting patients who are not in need of hospitalisation. \u201cIf a frail older person comes in with quite unspecific needs, they get \u2018social admission\u2019 written on their notes. There\u2019s even a phrase, \u2018acopia\u2019, which is basically doctors\u2019 code for saying someone can\u2019t cope at home,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Gentry suspects more and more British families caring for elderly relatives are reaching breaking point: \u201cOur sense is that it is getting worse, because the population is ageing and funding is barely keeping up.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>In Hereford county hospital, the nurses looking after Roger had gleaned some useful information from their good-natured but inscrutable new patient. He recalled on one fleeting occasion that his full name was Roger Curry \u2013 something he never managed to repeat during the rest of his stay in the UK. Not long afterwards he was moved to Credenhill Court rest home on the outskirts of town, which provides specialist care for dementia patients. His care was funded by Herefordshire council.</p> <p>Meanwhile, West Mercia police were running out of ideas. Usually dementia patients are quickly reunited with their families, but this was different. All they had was a name, but they couldn\u2019t be sure even that was correct. They checked missing person reports, examined CCTV footage and contacted the US and Canadian authorities. A social media campaign was launched.</p> <p>It was not until 2016, months later, that the police decided to appeal again for information; this time, Roger\u2019s story was featured on BBC and Sky News. A woman called Rebecca Reece came forward \u2013 the passerby who had flagged down the ambulance. She herself fell under suspicion; the police thought Roger might be her husband, but this was quickly ruled out.</p> <p>In March, the US authorities provided Hereford police with a list of names and addresses that could be linked to Roger Curry. One of these was a Kevin Curry of Whittier, California. An officer called the number linked to the address, but the person who answered claimed no one by the name of Curry lived there. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hayes talked of a glamorous life in LA and being on an SAS course when he found Roger. But his story began to unravel</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That call prompted Kevin to make contact with Hayes, who says he had an emotional conversation with Mary Jo. She warned him that if he came clean, Roger would be returned to the US, where he would end up homeless because the family could not look after him.</p> <p>That month, Hayes researched Roger\u2019s case online before calling the police; the judge remarked that this phone call was \u201cperhaps an example of the defendant\u2019s loose grasp upon reality\u201d, as there is no certainty that he would otherwise have been found. Hayes didn\u2019t confess, however. Instead he painted a picture of a glamorous life in which he travelled internationally and lived in Los Angeles. He said he had been with a Canadian serviceman when they\u2019d found a confused old man wandering on a dual carriageway. In subsequent calls, he told officers he had been attending a course at the local SAS base, and twice changed the location where he claimed to have found Roger. Still, nothing seems to have rung alarm bells. Indeed, Hayes went on to give officers a full statement, which led to further public appeals.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until April that his story began to unravel. The police became suspicious that Roger might in fact be Hayes\u2019s father; this led them to Ken Hayes and his new wife, who stunned officers with the news that his son knew the Curry family. They also revealed that he was not living in California, as he claimed, but had been deported to the UK three years ago.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Darragh MacIntyre was working on a Panorama film about missing people in the UK when he chanced on Roger\u2019s case in 2016. \u201cI met him in the nursing home in Hereford,\u201d he says. \u201cThe poor guy was trying his best but it wasn\u2019t really an interview.\u201d He was struck by how staff in Credenhill Court doted on Roger. \u201cHe was loved in the care home,\u201d MacIntyre recalls. \u201cSome people\u2019s character can change with dementia, but Roger was lovely. The only thing that drove staff to distraction was his love of muffins. He could eat four or five in one sitting.\u201d</p> <p>Roger wasn\u2019t included in the missing persons film but MacIntyre and his colleagues were intrigued by the mystery. They followed up a post on a BBC Midlands Facebook page by a viewer who had found a picture of a man named Earl Roger Curry from a 1950s US high school yearbook. MacIntyre\u2019s colleagues were able to trace this man to LA. They then used Google Earth to look at his last known address in Whittier: \u201cWe came upon what looked to be a burnt-out shack of a house in an otherwise wealthy neighbourhood,\u201d MacIntyre says.</p> <p>An officer who picked up the phone at the Whittier police department told the BBC that there had been a fire at the house in 2014. He also mentioned that Roger had Alzheimer\u2019s, his wife had Parkinson\u2019s disease and his son, Kevin, had been in prison. The BBC team flew out to investigate further. The family\u2019s former neighbours confirmed that it was indeed the same Roger Curry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d22eaf5e991fff351cb8bb2e5f9fb14c525913f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d22eaf5e991fff351cb8bb2e5f9fb14c525913f8/0_0_7235_4342/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Credenhill Court rest home, near Hereford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unable to trace his family, Herefordshire council paid for Roger to stay in Credenhill Court rest home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That was not all: the neighbours mentioned that, several months before Roger appeared in Hereford, the police had been called to the burnt-out house to rescue Roger and Mary Jo. A police report records that Roger had been seen wandering around behind a padlocked chain-link fence early in the morning. The police broke in and discovered Roger and Mary Jo had been sleeping on an inflatable mattress in the porch. There was some water and food in a cool box. Kevin denied any involvement, even though the police found a key for the padlock on his keyring.</p> <p>MacIntyre also established that Roger had taken out a restraining order against his son in 2000. Roger had claimed Kevin \u2013 who, it emerged, has previous convictions for assault with a deadly weapon, domestic assault and fraud, as well as burglary \u2013 had on one occasion pinned him up against a wall, and on another allegedly threatened to \u201cmess him up\u201d, claiming he \u201ccould kill him\u201d.</p> <p>The Panorama team didn\u2019t manage to find Kevin, but their breakthrough prompted the British authorities to make arrangements for Roger\u2019s repatriation. On 14 July 2016, a heavily sedated Roger touched down at Los Angeles International airport without any fanfare or press attention. He was later interviewed at a hospital by an official from Los Angeles County, who noted Roger had trouble talking and couldn\u2019t keep his eyes open. LA County lawyers then lodged a successful application to appoint a conservator to run his affairs. It stated: \u201cNo one in his family is prepared to accept responsibility for him. His own wife and son abused him when they took him overseas only to abandon him there.\u201d</p> <p>That same month, the BBC returned to LA. MacIntyre staked out the former family home for two or three days before Kevin finally showed up to collect the mail. Kevin briefly spoke to MacIntyre off camera. He denied doing anything wrong: he said his father had become ill on a holiday in England and he had asked someone to take him to hospital. \u201cIt didn\u2019t add up,\u201d MacIntyre says. \u201cWhy hadn\u2019t he tried to find his dad?\u201d</p> <p>He waited outside until Kevin emerged to collect his car. \u201cI asked him to do a proper interview,\u201d he says. \u201cHe refused and did one of the most extraordinary things I have ever seen: he pulled his hood over his face and got in his car. But he couldn\u2019t drive very quickly because he couldn\u2019t see where he was going. It was the strangest of getaways.\u201d Kevin has not commented publicly or responded to requests from journalists, including me, since that encounter with the BBC more than three years ago.</p> <p>Before leaving the US, MacIntyre visited the care home where Roger was staying. It was a disturbing experience: \u201cHe was in a very dark room, with curtains pulled. There was a fresh wound on his head. There was blood on his pillow. He looked completely different from the person I\u2019d met in Hereford,\u201d he says. \u201cHe looked uncared for.\u201d</p> <p>A few days later, MacIntyre returned to find Roger in a better condition. \u201cThe bedclothes had been changed. He still had the wound, but he had been shaved. That was of some comfort,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was still left with the impression that he would have been better off if he had remained in Hereford.\u201d Does he regret having found Roger\u2019s family? No, he says: \u201cI think people have to be held to account for what they do. I don\u2019t think it is permissible on any level to abandon your loved ones like they did. It is morally wrong.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s efforts led to Hayes\u2019s arrest. Officers interviewed him in his father\u2019s home in Somerset, in April 2016. He came clean about his friendship with Kevin and admitted taking Roger to Hereford.</p> <p>The CPS barrister, Simon Davis, who went on to prosecute Hayes, has more than 20 years\u2019 experience of serious and complex crimes, from murder to money laundering. Yet he found this case unique, not least because Hayes had little to gain from his deceptions. \u201cIt was a very odd case, but then he was a very odd defendant,\u201d he says, on the phone from his home in Birmingham. \u201cEverything he had said at the scene in November 2015 was rubbish. Everything he said to the woman he met near the hospital and the paramedics was rubbish. Everything he said when he made contact with the police in 2016 was rubbish. His lengthy witness statement, which ran to many pages, was also full of rubbish,\u201d Davis says.</p> <p>The barrister told the court in April this year that Hayes was a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who led police on \u201ca wild goose chase\u201d, wasting huge amounts of police time and public funds, and costing the NHS an estimated \u00a320,000 to look after Roger. His lies, Davis argued, led to innocent people falling under suspicion, such as the passerby, Rebecca Reece. They also jeopardised Roger\u2019s care: while he was in the UK, he had no access to his dementia medicine and medical records. It wasn\u2019t just the lies Hayes was alleged to have told in Hereford: Davis suggested in court that his backstory was \u201cfull of fantasy and fiction\u201d, and that \u201cfalsifying his past, falsifying his connections and his credentials were all part and parcel of his everyday life\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hayes says the only lies he told were to protect Roger and his family. Did his friend take advantage of him? \u2018Probably\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hayes understandably balks at this characterisation. \u201cWhat the prosecution said is absolute bunkum,\u201d he tells me in Oakwood prison. \u201cNobody makes up a 25-plus-year career, especially the career I\u2019m in where everybody knows each other,\u201d he says. Some of the drivers he has trained seem to partly back this up. Blair Chang, an LA estate agent who used to race in a pro-amateur series, confirms he was trained by Hayes for a couple of years. \u201cHe\u2019s the best trainer of motor sports drivers that I have ever come across,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was very well respected in the industry.\u201d Chang, who became friends with Hayes, disputes the way he was depicted in court: \u201cI didn\u2019t see a bad bone in his body, to be quite honest.\u201d</p> <p>US motor sports journalist David Malsher recalls that Hayes was a familiar face at Champ Car and IndyCar races for about six years. \u201cHe was attached to a couple of drivers, but he was generally ultra-quiet and came across as very intense and a bit of a loner. A couple of times I was asked by people, \u2018Who\u2019s that weird little dude with X or Y driver?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But the Royal Navy has no record of Hayes serving with the Marines, and the McLaren Formula One racing team has no record of him working as human performance director, as he claimed in a local newspaper in 2015.</p> <p>Hayes, who has no previous convictions in this country, is by all accounts a complicated character. Yet a psychologist who examined him before he was sentenced found that behind \u201chis grandiose expressions about his capabilities, his business acumen\u201d lay a vulnerable man with \u201ca tragic background of loss\u201d.</p> <p>He now readily admits to misleading the police \u2013 although he stresses he was motivated by a desire to help. \u201cThe only serious lies I\u2019ve told were in protection of Roger and his family,\u201d he says. Does he feel that Kevin took advantage of him? \u201cI would say probably, to a degree, but I understand why he did it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Hayes\u2019s adoptive family have stuck by him. His father, Ken, remembers a good-natured boy who did well at school. \u201cHe didn\u2019t put a foot wrong until he went to America. He was everything I wanted from a son,\u201d he says on the phone from Somerset. He feels his son was led astray. \u201cI met Kevin once when I went on holiday to see Simon,\u201d he says. \u201cI think Simon has been treated unfairly by him.\u201d</p> <p>The court heard that Kevin played a much bigger role in the plot, and stood to gain more if it succeeded. He was the one who, in advance of their trip to Europe, purchased return tickets for everyone in the family, apart from his father. He took Roger and Mary Jo on the plane, and booked the hire car that would take his father to Hereford.</p> <p>During Hayes\u2019s trial, the prosecution stated that Kevin was under investigation for abuse, fraud and kidnap in the US. This was repeated by West Mercia police in the days after Hayes was convicted. Yet the Los Angeles county district attorney\u2019s office insists no criminal charges have been filed. Neither the LAPD nor the LA sheriff\u2019s department is investigating Kevin Curry.</p> <p>Since Roger was repatriated, Kevin and Mary Jo have managed to keep a low profile. Mary Jo, who is thought to be living with her son in Norwalk, California, appeared with a lawyer at a 2016 hearing to determine Roger\u2019s fate; she never filed a counterpetition to that of LA county to appoint a probate conservator. Only one member of the wider family has broken ranks. Tim Otters, Kevin\u2019s uncle, told a Daily Mail reporter this year that Kevin had misled him about Roger\u2019s whereabouts when he last saw him. \u201cKevin\u2019s been a total liar ever since he was a little kid,\u201d Otters is reported to have said.</p> <p>MacIntyre tells me it seems wrong that Hayes is the only person who ended up in prison. \u201cSimon\u2019s motivation may well have been to help his friend, Kevin. There is certainly an irony that he is the one who has been punished,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Roger has been through a succession of care homes and is now in the Long Beach area of LA. His court-appointed conservator, Lorraine Tafoya, visited him last year. In a report filed with the court, she says she found him upbeat but noted that he had not had any visits from family or friends. He was in need of shoes, clothing and underwear.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/13/murder-on-the-allotment-committee-secretary\">Murder on the allotment: 'She was everything that he wanted to be'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her latest report, submitted in May this year, she found that Roger\u2019s health had worsened, leading to him being hospitalised twice.

      "bodyText": "There was something not quite right about the two men struggling out of Hereford bus station on a blustery day in November 2015. The dark-haired one was wearing what appeared to be military fatigues; his much older companion seemed confused and barely able to walk. A concerned passerby went to help. The younger man, who seemed to have an American or Canadian accent, explained that he had found the older man face down on a country road and was taking him to Hereford county hospital. She walked with them, doing her best to support the faltering older man, who could not move more than a couple of paces unaided. As the three of them approached the turning to the hospital, she flagged down an ambulance. The paramedics suspected dementia and assessed the older man in the rear cabin; he seemed to be smiling and crying at the same time. He had no ID and could only give his first name, Roger. His companion, sitting opposite, told the crew the same story: he had found the man on the side of a road some distance from Credenhill, a village on the outskirts of Hereford. But he claimed he couldn\u2019t share his own contact details because he had been working at the nearby SAS base, and soon vanished into the early evening gloom. Little was as it seemed that Saturday. It was just the beginning of an extraordinary international mystery that for six months flummoxed the British authorities and generated headlines around the world. The truth only partially emerged earlier this year, when Simon Hayes, a 53-year-old personal trainer, was given a two-and-a-half-year sentence for his role in a plot to abandon Roger Curry, an autistic American man with dementia, far from his home in Whittier, California. Hayes had driven Roger to Hereford the day after he had arrived, with the rest of the Curry family, on a flight from the US. The 78-year-old had been stripped of anything that could identity him, and dressed in brand new British supermarket clothes. Yet Hayes\u2019s motivations \u2013 and indeed much of the Curry family\u2019s backstory \u2013 remain a mystery. The judge at his trial, Daniel Pearce-Higgins, struggled to find any precedents for the case. Sentencing at Worcester crown court in April this year, he remarked: \u201cI cannot find any case remotely similar to the facts of this case, curiously because there appears to be no apparent benefit to the defendant.\u201d There is no evidence that money changed hands, or that Hayes benefited in any way. Why did he go to the lengths he did to help Roger\u2019s son, Kevin Curry, dump his father more than 5,000 miles from his US home? Is he \u2013 as the court heard \u2013 a convincing liar who stage-managed the British end of a plot to get the NHS to look after an unwanted relative? Or is he \u2013 as the court also heard \u2013 a tragic figure who took refuge in a fantasy world to protect himself from a turbulent life punctuated by loss? *** It\u2019s July 2019 and Prisoner A1682EJ appears jittery as he is finally let into the cavernous visiting hall of HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire. Wearing a grey polo shirt and tracksuit bottoms, Simon Hayes shuffles one way, then the other. The G4S guards took no notice and for a few moments he waits awkwardly in the no man\u2019s land between the door and the seating area, perhaps because mine is his first visit after 10 weeks in jail. Once he is seated, I notice a red gash on his forehead and a graze on his cheek. He winces as he touches the split skin. \u201cI was slapped by my cellmate,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cI fell and I caught my head on the bed.\u201d Hayes\u2019s face is covered with a film of sweat, his eyes darting from side to side and his hands faintly shaking. He asks for a cold drink and some food to settle his nerves. \u201cThank you,\u201d he calls as I go to the kiosk. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back when I get out, mate.\u201d As he swigs from a Coke bottle and tucks into a ham sandwich, he says he is ready to talk. \u201cI\u2019m OK \u2013 when you\u2019ve been in the Marines, this is nothing,\u201d he says. Hayes says he got to know the Curry family after moving to the US to launch an offshoot of his motorsport coaching business in 2003. He was keen to make a fresh start following the loss of his adoptive mother, Anita, who died from cancer in 2001. \u201cWhen she was being treated, it was difficult,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI viewed Ken [his adoptive father] and Anita as my real parents and loved them very much \u2013 still do.\u201d He had also just recovered from a serious car accident, in which his hire car collided with a lorry near Silverstone racing circuit, where he had been training drivers. \u201cIt was a good opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cI was also trying to figure out what my mum\u2019s death meant to me. I felt I needed to get away.\u201d Hayes settled in Los Angeles and his business started to grow, with amateur and professional drivers based in the US seeking his help. He was introduced to Kevin Curry by a mutual acquaintance; the two men shared a fascination with Area 51, the US air force base in Nevada that has long been a focus of conspiracy theories about alien spacecraft and extraterrestrials. \u201cI have an interest in the unexplained,\u201d Hayes tells me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I believe that aliens exist.\u201d He claims Kevin\u2019s interest in Area 51 stemmed from his father\u2019s connection to the base. \u201cRoger served at Area 51 as an air force technician. His family were trying to get an explanation as to why his particular dementia deteriorated so abruptly,\u201d he says, implying a connection. Despite the age difference \u2013 Hayes was 44, Kevin 29 \u2013 the pair grew close. Hayes spent Christmas 2010 with Kevin, Roger, then 70, and his wife, Mary Jo, then 59, at their house in a middle-class suburb of LA. However, Hayes soon found that all was not well with the Curry family. Mary Jo had Parkinson\u2019s disease and was finding it increasingly hard to look after her husband who, according to Hayes, was already suffering from dementia. Kevin told him the family couldn\u2019t afford to put his father in a care home. \u201cI was being asked to help out with Roger \u2013 I could see that he was becoming harder to manage,\u201d Hayes recalls. He remembers that Mary Jo would struggle to lift Roger from his chair and that sometimes he would lash out. \u201cI know that, through no fault of his own, Roger was at times uncontrollably violent towards Mary Jo,\u201d he says. Hayes also had his own problems. He says his \u201ctumultuous\u201d marriage to an American woman \u2013 whom he had met and married soon after arriving in the country \u2013 broke down in 2011. Then, in 2013, he was arrested for drink-driving. Hayes claims he had a fight with another prisoner in a holding cell, which led to his deportation. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give him my sunglasses. We got into an altercation, and then they filed charges that I incited a riot. They revoked my visa and gave me a date to turn up at the airport,\u201d he says. His account doesn\u2019t fully tally with official records. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement says Hayes was deported for overstaying his visa after his arrest for \u201cdriving under the influence\u201d by California Highway Patrol in 2013. Hayes had entered the US in 2007 under the department\u2019s visa-waiver programme, which typically allows British citizens to come to the US on holiday or business for up to 90 days. Back in the UK, Hayes moved to Somerset to live with his father, Ken, in a mobile home park; Ken was 90 and in poor health. America, though, was still on Hayes\u2019s mind; he unsuccessfully applied for visas and stayed in regular contact with Kevin. \u201cHe was a friend who was going through a very stressful period,\u201d Hayes explains. \u201cI tried my best to be supportive.\u201d He says Kevin asked him to look into ways of bringing Roger to the UK, and admits that he researched possible British care homes, but insists he had no idea that Kevin was planning to dump his father here. \u201cRoger was getting worse. He was contemplating healthcare facilities in Mexico, Canada and the UK,\u201d he says. In 2015, Kevin announced he would be coming to Europe on holiday with his children, while Roger and Mary Jo stayed in a respite home. He said he would be stopping off in the UK and invited his old friend to join him. \u201cI never take any time off, so I was excited to have a break,\u201d Hayes says. But when he went to meet Kevin at Gatwick airport, he claims he was shocked to see Roger and Mary Jo coming through the arrivals gate, too. \u201cRoger was in a wheelchair. He couldn\u2019t walk. Mary Jo looked exhausted. She could barely stand up. They had deteriorated since I had last seen them,\u201d he says. \u201cKevin told me that the hospital would not take them.\u201d That night they booked into the nearby Gatwick Marriott hotel. Hayes says Kevin asked him to take Roger to hospital, so they coud have their family holiday. Hayes says he felt sorry for Kevin and agreed. \u201cI said, \u2018Give yourselves a week and then pick your dad up, or make an arrangement with the authorities so that your dad can stay here and be financially supported by his insurance company,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I did not for one minute suggest or insinuate, in any way, shape or form, that he should be abandoned in this country.\u201d Kevin booked a hire car, naming Hayes as an additional driver. In the morning, Hayes drove 157 miles to Hereford bus station, with Roger dressed in new clothes and stripped of his ID. This part of Hayes\u2019s account is particularly puzzling: if Roger was sick, why not choose a closer hospital? There were two \u2013 East Surrey and Crawley \u2013 within about six miles. Bizarrely, Hayes claims he chose Hereford hospital because he had visited it once before with a client and thought it \u201cwas more straightforward than driving all over London\u201d. He acknowledges that his decision \u201cseems odd\u201d, adding only that he was \u201csuffering from mental health issues\u201d that clouded his judgment. Did he know Roger had been stripped of anything that could identify him, and dressed in new clothes that would provide investigators with few clues? Hayes says not, but remembers that Kevin had borrowed his credit card to do some shopping before they left for Hereford. \u201cI had told Kevin: \u2018I\u2019m not a nurse. I\u2019m not responsible for dressing or anything else to do with your dad \u2013 I\u2019m offering to drive him to a safe, lawful location where he can get medical treatment, and that\u2019s it.\u2019\u201d That afternoon, he parked in Hereford bus station and led Roger towards the hospital. Why did he tell the passerby and paramedics that he had found him face down in the countryside? \u201cI wanted to give the family some time\u2026 at least a week,\u201d he says sheepishly. How did it feel to leave a confused and distressed old man, without any medication or paperwork? Hayes hesitates, searching for the right words. \u201cIt was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve had to do,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I did it because I\u2019d seen the lack of care he got from his own country and government \u2013 a former veteran, I might add, which is disgraceful.\u201d Hayes returned to Gatwick and joined the rest of the Curry family on holiday in Copenhagen. They stayed in a city-centre hotel, but Mary Jo was in such poor health she rarely left it. Instead, Hayes says, he went for long walks with Kevin and they talked about Roger\u2019s future. \u201cIt was an odd holiday,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t relaxing. I felt uncomfortable with the situation I\u2019d been put in.\u201d Hayes left Copenhagen before the Currys. He contends that he had no idea Roger was left behind when Kevin and his mother later returned to the US. He says that when he spoke to Kevin in the weeks and months that followed, he was told Roger was back at home. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say he was lying to me\u2026\u201d he says, his voice trailing off, as if struggling to shake off some lingering loyalty to Kevin. \u201cHe misled me, whether it was for the right or the wrong reasons.\u201d *** So-called granny dumping \u2013 where families unable to afford or cope with their caring responsibilities offload elderly relatives on to hospitals \u2013 is not uncommon in the US. As far back as 1992, the American College of Emergency Physicians estimated that 70,000 elderly people were being abandoned each year. Dr Kevin Biese, an associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of North Carolina, says medical staff routinely encounter elderly people, with no pressing health needs, brought into emergency departments because their families cannot cope. \u201cFrequently we see the family saying their elderly relative \u2018had a fever yesterday\u2019 or \u2018chest pain\u2019, but what they\u2019re really saying is, \u2018We just can\u2019t take it\u2019,\u201d he says. Outright abandonments, where the family leave a relative unattended, are rarer, but still happen, especially in poorer areas. \u201cEvery emergency doctor has at least several patients a year where that is the case,\u201d Biese says. He blames the lack of support for caregivers in the US. \u201cThere is a tremendous burden placed on adult children,\u201d he says. Medicaid-funded facilities are available only to the very poorest older people. \u201cThese places are not where any of us would want to live. You might have 30 patients to one nursing assistant.\u201d According to Age UK, a record 1.4 million older people in England are not getting the support they need at home to carry out essential everyday tasks, such as getting out of bed and going to the toilet, because of the chronic underfunding of local social care services. Tom Gentry, the charity\u2019s senior health influencing manager, says some of these people are ending up in A&amp;E departments because their carers cannot cope. \u201cThese families are at the whip end of having to care for elderly relatives. Hospital is perceived to be the only option because the local authority isn\u2019t helping.\u201d Research by the charity has revealed that almost 1,000 over-65s are needlessly admitted to hospital every month. Gentry says doctors even have medical terms for admitting patients who are not in need of hospitalisation. \u201cIf a frail older person comes in with quite unspecific needs, they get \u2018social admission\u2019 written on their notes. There\u2019s even a phrase, \u2018acopia\u2019, which is basically doctors\u2019 code for saying someone can\u2019t cope at home,\u201d he says. Gentry suspects more and more British families caring for elderly relatives are reaching breaking point: \u201cOur sense is that it is getting worse, because the population is ageing and funding is barely keeping up.\u201d *** In Hereford county hospital, the nurses looking after Roger had gleaned some useful information from their good-natured but inscrutable new patient. He recalled on one fleeting occasion that his full name was Roger Curry \u2013 something he never managed to repeat during the rest of his stay in the UK. Not long afterwards he was moved to Credenhill Court rest home on the outskirts of town, which provides specialist care for dementia patients. His care was funded by Herefordshire council. Meanwhile, West Mercia police were running out of ideas. Usually dementia patients are quickly reunited with their families, but this was different. All they had was a name, but they couldn\u2019t be sure even that was correct. They checked missing person reports, examined CCTV footage and contacted the US and Canadian authorities. A social media campaign was launched. It was not until 2016, months later, that the police decided to appeal again for information; this time, Roger\u2019s story was featured on BBC and Sky News. A woman called Rebecca Reece came forward \u2013 the passerby who had flagged down the ambulance. She herself fell under suspicion; the police thought Roger might be her husband, but this was quickly ruled out. In March, the US authorities provided Hereford police with a list of names and addresses that could be linked to Roger Curry. One of these was a Kevin Curry of Whittier, California. An officer called the number linked to the address, but the person who answered claimed no one by the name of Curry lived there. That call prompted Kevin to make contact with Hayes, who says he had an emotional conversation with Mary Jo. She warned him that if he came clean, Roger would be returned to the US, where he would end up homeless because the family could not look after him. That month, Hayes researched Roger\u2019s case online before calling the police; the judge remarked that this phone call was \u201cperhaps an example of the defendant\u2019s loose grasp upon reality\u201d, as there is no certainty that he would otherwise have been found. Hayes didn\u2019t confess, however. Instead he painted a picture of a glamorous life in which he travelled internationally and lived in Los Angeles. He said he had been with a Canadian serviceman when they\u2019d found a confused old man wandering on a dual carriageway. In subsequent calls, he told officers he had been attending a course at the local SAS base, and twice changed the location where he claimed to have found Roger. Still, nothing seems to have rung alarm bells. Indeed, Hayes went on to give officers a full statement, which led to further public appeals. It wasn\u2019t until April that his story began to unravel. The police became suspicious that Roger might in fact be Hayes\u2019s father; this led them to Ken Hayes and his new wife, who stunned officers with the news that his son knew the Curry family. They also revealed that he was not living in California, as he claimed, but had been deported to the UK three years ago. *** Darragh MacIntyre was working on a Panorama film about missing people in the UK when he chanced on Roger\u2019s case in 2016. \u201cI met him in the nursing home in Hereford,\u201d he says. \u201cThe poor guy was trying his best but it wasn\u2019t really an interview.\u201d He was struck by how staff in Credenhill Court doted on Roger. \u201cHe was loved in the care home,\u201d MacIntyre recalls. \u201cSome people\u2019s character can change with dementia, but Roger was lovely. The only thing that drove staff to distraction was his love of muffins. He could eat four or five in one sitting.\u201d Roger wasn\u2019t included in the missing persons film but MacIntyre and his colleagues were intrigued by the mystery. They followed up a post on a BBC Midlands Facebook page by a viewer who had found a picture of a man named Earl Roger Curry from a 1950s US high school yearbook. MacIntyre\u2019s colleagues were able to trace this man to LA. They then used Google Earth to look at his last known address in Whittier: \u201cWe came upon what looked to be a burnt-out shack of a house in an otherwise wealthy neighbourhood,\u201d MacIntyre says. An officer who picked up the phone at the Whittier police department told the BBC that there had been a fire at the house in 2014. He also mentioned that Roger had Alzheimer\u2019s, his wife had Parkinson\u2019s disease and his son, Kevin, had been in prison. The BBC team flew out to investigate further. The family\u2019s former neighbours confirmed that it was indeed the same Roger Curry. That was not all: the neighbours mentioned that, several months before Roger appeared in Hereford, the police had been called to the burnt-out house to rescue Roger and Mary Jo. A police report records that Roger had been seen wandering around behind a padlocked chain-link fence early in the morning. The police broke in and discovered Roger and Mary Jo had been sleeping on an inflatable mattress in the porch. There was some water and food in a cool box. Kevin denied any involvement, even though the police found a key for the padlock on his keyring. MacIntyre also established that Roger had taken out a restraining order against his son in 2000. Roger had claimed Kevin \u2013 who, it emerged, has previous convictions for assault with a deadly weapon, domestic assault and fraud, as well as burglary \u2013 had on one occasion pinned him up against a wall, and on another allegedly threatened to \u201cmess him up\u201d, claiming he \u201ccould kill him\u201d. The Panorama team didn\u2019t manage to find Kevin, but their breakthrough prompted the British authorities to make arrangements for Roger\u2019s repatriation. On 14 July 2016, a heavily sedated Roger touched down at Los Angeles International airport without any fanfare or press attention. He was later interviewed at a hospital by an official from Los Angeles County, who noted Roger had trouble talking and couldn\u2019t keep his eyes open. LA County lawyers then lodged a successful application to appoint a conservator to run his affairs. It stated: \u201cNo one in his family is prepared to accept responsibility for him. His own wife and son abused him when they took him overseas only to abandon him there.\u201d That same month, the BBC returned to LA. MacIntyre staked out the former family home for two or three days before Kevin finally showed up to collect the mail. Kevin briefly spoke to MacIntyre off camera. He denied doing anything wrong: he said his father had become ill on a holiday in England and he had asked someone to take him to hospital. \u201cIt didn\u2019t add up,\u201d MacIntyre says. \u201cWhy hadn\u2019t he tried to find his dad?\u201d He waited outside until Kevin emerged to collect his car. \u201cI asked him to do a proper interview,\u201d he says. \u201cHe refused and did one of the most extraordinary things I have ever seen: he pulled his hood over his face and got in his car. But he couldn\u2019t drive very quickly because he couldn\u2019t see where he was going. It was the strangest of getaways.\u201d Kevin has not commented publicly or responded to requests from journalists, including me, since that encounter with the BBC more than three years ago. Before leaving the US, MacIntyre visited the care home where Roger was staying. It was a disturbing experience: \u201cHe was in a very dark room, with curtains pulled. There was a fresh wound on his head. There was blood on his pillow. He looked completely different from the person I\u2019d met in Hereford,\u201d he says. \u201cHe looked uncared for.\u201d A few days later, MacIntyre returned to find Roger in a better condition. \u201cThe bedclothes had been changed. He still had the wound, but he had been shaved. That was of some comfort,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was still left with the impression that he would have been better off if he had remained in Hereford.\u201d Does he regret having found Roger\u2019s family? No, he says: \u201cI think people have to be held to account for what they do. I don\u2019t think it is permissible on any level to abandon your loved ones like they did. It is morally wrong.\u201d *** The BBC\u2019s efforts led to Hayes\u2019s arrest. Officers interviewed him in his father\u2019s home in Somerset, in April 2016. He came clean about his friendship with Kevin and admitted taking Roger to Hereford. The CPS barrister, Simon Davis, who went on to prosecute Hayes, has more than 20 years\u2019 experience of serious and complex crimes, from murder to money laundering. Yet he found this case unique, not least because Hayes had little to gain from his deceptions. \u201cIt was a very odd case, but then he was a very odd defendant,\u201d he says, on the phone from his home in Birmingham. \u201cEverything he had said at the scene in November 2015 was rubbish. Everything he said to the woman he met near the hospital and the paramedics was rubbish. Everything he said when he made contact with the police in 2016 was rubbish. His lengthy witness statement, which ran to many pages, was also full of rubbish,\u201d Davis says. The barrister told the court in April this year that Hayes was a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who led police on \u201ca wild goose chase\u201d, wasting huge amounts of police time and public funds, and costing the NHS an estimated \u00a320,000 to look after Roger. His lies, Davis argued, led to innocent people falling under suspicion, such as the passerby, Rebecca Reece. They also jeopardised Roger\u2019s care: while he was in the UK, he had no access to his dementia medicine and medical records. It wasn\u2019t just the lies Hayes was alleged to have told in Hereford: Davis suggested in court that his backstory was \u201cfull of fantasy and fiction\u201d, and that \u201cfalsifying his past, falsifying his connections and his credentials were all part and parcel of his everyday life\u201d. Hayes understandably balks at this characterisation. \u201cWhat the prosecution said is absolute bunkum,\u201d he tells me in Oakwood prison. \u201cNobody makes up a 25-plus-year career, especially the career I\u2019m in where everybody knows each other,\u201d he says. Some of the drivers he has trained seem to partly back this up. Blair Chang, an LA estate agent who used to race in a pro-amateur series, confirms he was trained by Hayes for a couple of years. \u201cHe\u2019s the best trainer of motor sports drivers that I have ever come across,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was very well respected in the industry.\u201d Chang, who became friends with Hayes, disputes the way he was depicted in court: \u201cI didn\u2019t see a bad bone in his body, to be quite honest.\u201d US motor sports journalist David Malsher recalls that Hayes was a familiar face at Champ Car and IndyCar races for about six years. \u201cHe was attached to a couple of drivers, but he was generally ultra-quiet and came across as very intense and a bit of a loner. A couple of times I was asked by people, \u2018Who\u2019s that weird little dude with X or Y driver?\u2019\u201d But the Royal Navy has no record of Hayes serving with the Marines, and the McLaren Formula One racing team has no record of him working as human performance director, as he claimed in a local newspaper in 2015. Hayes, who has no previous convictions in this country, is by all accounts a complicated character. Yet a psychologist who examined him before he was sentenced found that behind \u201chis grandiose expressions about his capabilities, his business acumen\u201d lay a vulnerable man with \u201ca tragic background of loss\u201d. He now readily admits to misleading the police \u2013 although he stresses he was motivated by a desire to help. \u201cThe only serious lies I\u2019ve told were in protection of Roger and his family,\u201d he says. Does he feel that Kevin took advantage of him? \u201cI would say probably, to a degree, but I understand why he did it,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, Hayes\u2019s adoptive family have stuck by him. His father, Ken, remembers a good-natured boy who did well at school. \u201cHe didn\u2019t put a foot wrong until he went to America. He was everything I wanted from a son,\u201d he says on the phone from Somerset. He feels his son was led astray. \u201cI met Kevin once when I went on holiday to see Simon,\u201d he says. \u201cI think Simon has been treated unfairly by him.\u201d The court heard that Kevin played a much bigger role in the plot, and stood to gain more if it succeeded. He was the one who, in advance of their trip to Europe, purchased return tickets for everyone in the family, apart from his father. He took Roger and Mary Jo on the plane, and booked the hire car that would take his father to Hereford. During Hayes\u2019s trial, the prosecution stated that Kevin was under investigation for abuse, fraud and kidnap in the US. This was repeated by West Mercia police in the days after Hayes was convicted. Yet the Los Angeles county district attorney\u2019s office insists no criminal charges have been filed. Neither the LAPD nor the LA sheriff\u2019s department is investigating Kevin Curry. Since Roger was repatriated, Kevin and Mary Jo have managed to keep a low profile. Mary Jo, who is thought to be living with her son in Norwalk, California, appeared with a lawyer at a 2016 hearing to determine Roger\u2019s fate; she never filed a counterpetition to that of LA county to appoint a probate conservator. Only one member of the wider family has broken ranks. Tim Otters, Kevin\u2019s uncle, told a Daily Mail reporter this year that Kevin had misled him about Roger\u2019s whereabouts when he last saw him. \u201cKevin\u2019s been a total liar ever since he was a little kid,\u201d Otters is reported to have said. MacIntyre tells me it seems wrong that Hayes is the only person who ended up in prison. \u201cSimon\u2019s motivation may well have been to help his friend, Kevin. There is certainly an irony that he is the one who has been punished,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, Roger has been through a succession of care homes and is now in the Long Beach area of LA. His court-appointed conservator, Lorraine Tafoya, visited him last year. In a report filed with the court, she says she found him upbeat but noted that he had not had any visits from family or friends. He was in need of shoes, clothing and underwear. In her latest report, submitted in May this year, she found that Roger\u2019s health had worsened, leading to him being hospitalised twice. He is no longer able to walk and needs help eating, grooming and bathing. Now 79, Roger did not speak to Tafoya but his carers told her \u2013 in a familiar refrain, from Hereford to LA \u2013 that he remained \u201cmild-mannered and respectful\u201d. The LA county department of mental health says neither Roger\u2019s wife nor son \u2013 who is allowed to see him, providing he does not take him out of the care home \u2013 has been to visit him since he was flown back to the US in 2016. *** At Oakwood prison, the G4S guards announce our visiting session is nearing its end. Girlfriends kiss boyfriends. Middle-aged men squeeze their sons\u2019 shoulders. Brothers embrace. Hayes gets up from behind the empty cups, bottles and packets covering the table. His blood-stained head drops and he troops back towards the holding cell. In these final moments, his mask again appears to slip and the vulnerability noted by his psychologist is plain to see. It is hard not to be reminded of the judge\u2019s observation that Hayes\u2019s actions, while certainly costly, \u201cmay have been a misguided attempt to help another\u201d. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

At the time, she said: \u201cI am pro-Palestinian and I am pro-Israeli. I am really sick and tired of our buying into this idea that we have to make these binary choices.\u201d It was a statement of centrist equivocation \u2013 between oppressed and oppressor \u2013 that could have been uttered by Nancy Pelosi. Though Pressley stood firm on other important issues, such as opposing June\u2019s border funding bill, one need only look at her views during the 2016 Democratic primary to see her careful political instincts at work: she endorsed Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders back then, not even picking the path of neutrality embraced by Elizabeth Warren. At the time, she even said that Clinton, unlike Sanders, \u201cknows plans without price tags are simply pandering.\u201d This was the kind of anti-populist messaging that, echoed by her fellow Clinton surrogates, helped spell doom in the 2016 general election. With rhetoric like that, perhaps the story that the media should be telling this week isn\u2019t about Pressley breaking with the rest of the Squad to endorse Warren over Bernie, but her evolving to the point that she would risk endorsing Warren over frontrunner Joe Biden. But the real reason I\u2019m interested in Pressley is that she\u2019s a perfect illustration of what happens when we project radical ideas on to people just because of who their enemies happen to be or because of what they look like. Ayanna Pressley is a Democrat who, like many others, is slowly inching leftward. Yet when she says, referring to the Squad, that \u201cwe are not a monolith. We don\u2019t land in the same place on every vote,\u201d she seems to be completely ignored. Let\u2019s stop doing that, and accept that people who are trailblazers might not all be blazing the same path, and that we don\u2019t have to necessarily support them. I knew, for example, that my project was a very different one than Pressley\u2019s when I read an interview where she said her goal was to avoid a \u201cnarrative of binary choices. Are you insider or outsider? Are you privileged or poor?\u201d That\u2019s the opposite of what the emerging New Left is and ought to be doing \u2013 naming enemies, politicizing issues, creating polarizations, all to push the kind of change that can improve millions of lives. Pressley will be an ally in many of these struggles, but out of respect for her own beliefs and tactics, let\u2019s stop conflating her vision with ours.

      "bodyText": "Long before the rise of tech corporations, high rents and Lime scooters, the Bay Area was a breeding ground for for black artists and activists. Artists such as Emory Douglas created Soviet-influenced protest art for the Black Panther newspaper; Raymond Saunders strived to highlight the beauty of blackness with his coal-dark backdrops and figures; Cleveland Bellow brought art into the streets with his public murals and billboards. During this period, black art became louder, prouder, and unconcerned with the white gaze. Emory Douglas\u2019s posters. This shift is celebrated in the De Young museum\u2019s latest exhibition, Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power 1963\u20131983, which arrives in San Francisco after debuting in London in 2017 and stopping off in Brooklyn, Bentonville, Arkansas, and Los Angeles. Set against the backdrop of black displacement in the Bay Area \u2013 San Francisco\u2019s black population has dwindled from 13% in 1970 to 5% today \u2013 this iteration includes additional works by local artists and celebrates the Bay Area\u2019s role in the black power movement. The reception area of the De Young revives an exhibition that the museum first staged in 1968 \u2013 black-and-white photos of the Black Panthers, captured by Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch. These photos include a classroom of young black students eagerly learning, two men resting after a protest, children laughing. The images are moving but also crushing because 50 years later, portraits of black children smiling still feel under-seen. #62 from A Photographic Essay on the Black Panthers. The De Young has revived an exhibition it originally hosted in 1968. The exhibition\u2019s Black Power and Art in the Streets section features Cleveland Bellow\u2019s untitled 1968 sketch of a black boy with his arms raised. Bellow later turned the sketch into an Oakland billboard, part of the wave of black murals and public art that flooded large cities. This week, the museum will re-create the billboard. Throughout the show\u2019s run, the De Young is committed to increasing the diversity of visitors by hosting free days and community programming, including a block party and screening of the recent film The Last Black Man in San Francisco. Much of the art created in the Bay Area during the black power movement can be traced back to the Black Panther party. Through its free breakfast programs, cultural centers, and community newspapers, the party provided invaluable resources and support to black artists. Artists were often deeply connected to the party: Emory Douglas served as the minister of culture, mentoring young artists and leading the artistic direction of the Black Panther newspaper. Betye Saar, Rainbow Mojo, 1972. The black power movement is frequently historicized as being rife with militant anger and radicalism. But the artworks here reveal thoughtful, considered wrestlings with the question of how black pain and liberation are represented. There are experiments with abstractionism, in-your-face nude portraits that confront racist stereotypes about the black body, and mixed-media art created with soiled paper bags, type 4C hair, and objects purchased at the Bay Area\u2019s celebrated Alameda Flea Market. Many of the Bay Area artists featured originally created their work for group shows at the Rainbow Sign, a black cultural center that operated in Berkeley from 1971 to 1977. Rainbow Sign was a little bit of everything to the black community, and even the presidential candidate Kamala Harris attended when she was \u201cthat little girl\u201d. The space provided discounted meals to children, staged concerts for Nina Simone and held book signings for Maya Angelou and Alice Walker. In 1973, the Rainbow Sign held a group exhibition centered around reimagining the racist caricature Aunt Jemima. A piece from that show, by Betye Saar, is included at the De Young. In Saar\u2019s colorful, slightly irreverent work, an Aunt Jemima figurine holds a broom and a shotgun, existing between forced domesticity and violent revolution.

Inevitably, Soul of a Nation mirrors the black power movement and features a disproportionate number of male artists and subjects. \u201cWhen I think about my work, and I look at what I see here at the exhibition, I wish I made more work with women in it,\u201d the Bay Area artist Mike Henderson admitted.

United, however, have probably been the superior team and will be on better terms with themselves. And no Berisha?

      "bodyText": "Well, that\u2019s all she, and I, wrote. Some excellent performances to speak of today, most notably by the Matildas and Ashleigh Barty. Western United will sleep soundly tonight, knowing that the team they\u2019ve assembled is more than capable of matching it with the A-League\u2019s elite. Also some less-than-impressive efforts today. But we\u2019re not mentioning any names, are we Great Britain Lions? I\u2019ve had fun but I\u2019m now running late for an appointment with my mattress. See you next time. A gutsy performance from United to come back from a goal down and take all three points as well as their maiden home victory. The result puts United level on points with the Wanderers, who tonight had their colours lowered for the first time this season. It\u2019s still early, but both teams look capable of doing something meaningful this season. Australia have rallied from 12 points down to beat Samoa at the Oceania rugby sevens championship to secure their spot at next year\u2019s Olympics. Tim Walsh\u2019s men won 19-12 in the Olympic play-off thanks to a composed second-half lead by bench spark Henry Hutchison and captain Lewis Holland, whose late charge down and try sealed the win. Things looked dire earlier though with Samoa scoring twice despite playing the bulk of the first half with six men. Three times Australia coughed up possession in attacking positions and, trailing 12-0 at the break, it looked as if Australia would be scrapping for a Tokyo berth in an all-or-nothing tournament on Games eve. Hutchison changed the narrative though, carrying with composure and scoring the first try before forcing a turnover that led to the next. Holland missed the conversion that would have put them in front, but moments later charged down a Samoa kick and jumped on the loose ball to ensure his men would be in Tokyo next year. Newcastle coach Ernie Merrick is fuming over a VAR decision not to award a penalty after his midfielder Nick Fitzgerald had appeared to be pushed in the back in the 22nd minute of their 1-1 A-League draw with Perth. Yet to win a match after four games this season, the Jets led 1-0 until the 86th minute when Glory\u2019s Diego Castro popped up late to dash their hopes on Saturday at McDonald Jones Stadium. And despite several late chances to score, including the Glory\u2019s Alex Grant being red-carded in the 87th minute, Merrick has delivered a stunning spray at referee Jonathan Barreiro over the first-half incident. \u201cBefore we start, let\u2019s get the penalty out of the way. Have you ever seen a more blatant penalty? A push in the back, extended arm in the penalty box. How is that not a penalty?\u201d Merrick said. At half-time, Merrick was seen to approach the referee to seek clarification, but said he did not receive it. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t speaking Spanish, yes I spoke to him,\u201d Merrick continued. \u201cHe speaks a lot of Spanish during the games and talks to the opposition a lot in Spanish. We\u2019re in Australia, I would have thought he would be speaking English most of the time so we can all hear what he\u2019s saying to his mates.\u201d A-League: 58 mins: Goal! Western United 2-1 Western Sydney Luck\u2019s a fortune for Appiah-Kubi, who finds himself in the right spot when G\u00fcl\u00fcm\u2019s fluffed attempt at goal falls at his feet. In the end it\u2019s an easy shot to the right of the keeper to put United in the lead for the first time tonight. A-League: 50 mins: Western United 1-1 Western Sydney Huge delay here with VAR holding centre stage, as VAR likes to do, ruling on whether the ball, headed by McDonald into the chest of the Wanderers keeper, has in fact crossed the line. Confusion abounds, and you can\u2019t deny it is good theatre, but the ruling is NO GOAL. United players are convinced (of course) and so are the Fox Sports commentators, but it\u2019s what VAR thinks that counts. I promised you our report on Great Britain\u2019s rugby league loss to New Zealand in Christchurch. And I am nothing if not a man of my word. A-League: HT: Western United 1-1 Western Sydney So, where were we? Oh, yes. Geelong. Well, since Durante\u2019s equaliser there hasn\u2019t been much to report. Save for yellow cards to Patrick Ziegler and Ersan G\u00fcl\u00fcm, and Kone\u2019s injury-enforced substitution for Calver, the first half more or less fizzled out. United, however, have probably been the superior team and will be on better terms with themselves. And no Berisha? Don\u2019t start me. A-League: 13 mins: Goal! Western United 1-1 Western Sydney The Wanderers barely have a moment to enjoy their lead before Durante rises at the far post and heads home to restore parity. A pretty easy win for the Kiwis in Christchurch. I\u2019ll have a spanking good match report for you very shortly. Until then, I\u2019ll leave you with this to ponder. A-League: 5 mins: Goal! Western United 0-1 Western Sydney A very tidy start for the Wanderers in Geelong, with Thomas Duke finding himself on the receiving end of a nice ball from Georgievski. Duke could\u2019ve blazed away, he could\u2019ve gone for power, he could have fluffed it completely, but what he did was caress the ball with the inside of his right boot and curve it past the keeper. Pretty to watch. Fiji have edged Papua New Guinea 22-20 in their Oceania Cup rugby league Test in Christchurch. It was a lot closer than many had predicted but Fiji\u2019s second-half defence ensured they clung on for victory. After a quiet opening quarter, the game exploded into life when prop Tui Kamikamica opened the scoring for Fiji in the 22nd minute. That set off a back-and-forward period in which both sides scored before PNG captain Rhyse Martin kicked a penalty goal on the stroke of half-time to give his side a 14-12 lead at the break. Tries to Viliame Kikau and Ben Nakubuwai in the second spell gave Fiji a slender advantage which proved the difference. * * Again, thanks to AAP We\u2019re not far away at all from the opening whistle in the A-League clash between Western United and Western Sydney Wanderers. Teams: Western United (3-4-3): Kurto (GK); Gulum, Durante, Chapman; Pain, Jertec, Kone, Risdon; McDonald, Diamanti, Appiah-Kubi. Subs: Scott (GK), Burgess, Hamill, Pierias, Calver, Stamatelopoulos, Vujica. Western Sydney (4-4-2): Lopar (GK); Wilmering, Ziegler, McGowan, Georgievski; Muller, Baccus, Schwegler, Yeboah; Meier, Duke. Subs: Suman (GK), Adam, Trew, Russell, Grozos, Mourdoukoutas. Should be a good game. The Wanderers are in fine form and the new boys haven\u2019t been too shabby, either. I\u2019m tipping a high-scoring draw and, in the 81st minute, a rousing rendition of Go West\u2019s King Of Wishful Thinking by the entire crowd, players and administrative staff. It\u2019s certainly been a big week for women\u2019s football in Australia, so you could be forgiven - I once had an editor who despised this turn of phrase, couldn\u2019t understand it and never allowed it - for cutting them some slack against Chile this afternoon, especially as they were first-up after the World Cup. But when Sam Kerr\u2019s in your team, who needs excuses? Perth have survived a massive scare to defeat Adelaide Strikers by two runs in a last-ball cliffhanger at Karen Rolton Oval. Bridget Patterson, who played the knock of her life to drag the Strikers out of the mire, needed four to win off the final ball from Heather Graham to haul in the Scorchers\u2019 3-173. But Patterson, who had crunched six fours and three sixes in her sizzling 60 from 32 balls, couldn\u2019t quite find the rope one last time. * Brisbane Heat have leapt to second position on the WBBL ladder after thumping Sydney Sixers by seven wickets in Saturday\u2019s blockbuster at North Sydney Oval. In a rematch of last season\u2019s final, the reigning champions were untroubled in cruising past the Sixers\u2019 modest 7-123 with 19 balls to spare, leapfrogging them and Adelaide Strikers in the standings in the process. With her sister Grace Harris (26 not out) at the other end at the end, Laura Harris raised the Heat\u2019s fourth successive win over the Sixers by smashing Hayley Silver-Holmes over the long-on fence for her second six. Openers Beth Mooney and Maddy Green contributed 25 apiece and No.3 Jess Jonassen top-scored with 33 to cap a fine all-round game before the Harris sisters finished with a bang to make light work of the chase. * A stunning masterclass from captain Jess Duffin has propelled Melbourne Renegades to a last-ball, four-wicket win over Hobart Hurricanes at CitiPower Centre in St Kilda. With one required off the final delivery to reel in the Hurricanes\u2019 5-150, Maitlan Brown calmly flicked Nicola Carey past square leg for the winning run, snapping the Renegades\u2019 three-game WBBL losing streak. The home team was in huge trouble earlier in the chase when they slumped to 3-12 after Hobart spearhead Belinda Vakawera (2-21) had started with a wicket-maiden and proceeded to cut through the top order. But the Hurricanes simply had no answer for Duffin. * * With thanks to Australian Associated Press. International rugby league: 47 mins: New Zealand 20-2 Great Britain It hasn\u2019t been a great tour of Oceania for the Lions and tonight the fans in Christchurch are being treated to the Kiwis tucking into the visitors. Must\u2019ve been the haka. This one\u2019s just out of the oven. The Jets led for much of the game after Jason Hoffman\u2019s strike after 31 minutes, but Perth were always in the contest and deservedly shared the spoils thanks to Diego Castro\u2019s equaliser with barely four minutes of regulation time remaining. Newcastle needed a win here to lift themselves from near the rear of the ladder, but a point on the road will do the Glory nicely. A straight answer to that question is: very, very good, the best female tennis player on the planet if you really want to know. A not-so-straight answer to that question is: don\u2019t you know how good she is? Where have you been, under a rock? Anyway, this superb player, who is looking forward to a can or two on the couch after her amazing year, gave Caroline Garcia a tennis lesson this afternoon to draw Australia level with France in the Fed Cup final. Onya, Ash. Good evening, sports fans. The footy seasons are over, the Test summer hasn\u2019t yet begun, but I tells ya, it\u2019s been a pretty big day in sport. And it\u2019s not over yet. With the Fed Cup, WBBL, A-League, international rugby league and the mighty Matildas in action, today is ample proof that there is no such thing as a lull period in sport. I\u2019ve got updates and results galore to bring you, but before I do that, wrap your staring gear around this.",

Away from politics local issues such as jobs, mental health and medical services are likely to also be on people\u2019s minds. So we\u2019d like to understand the big issues facing you and your family and which policies matter to you. Who has an impact on your community that we should meet? Are there issues in your family that create division? Are you thinking of switching your vote? Or perhaps you feel disengaged from national politics altogether. We\u2019d also like to know how you following this election whether traditional media such as TV and newspapers or online news sites or social media. Do you belong to local Facebook or WhatsApp groups? How to contribute We want to hear from people who live in Belfast East about the issues that matter to them in the upcoming election.

      "body": "<p>In 2008, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/20/meet-the-new-directors-who-lit-up-the-film-festivals\">Mati Diop</a> travelled to Senegal, the birthplace of her father, to make a short film about migration. Her cousin introduced her to some friends who were \u201cthinking about crossing\u201d; in other words, undertaking the dangerous boat journey up the west African coast and across to Spain. Diop was aware of the logical reasons that might motivate someone to take such a huge risk \u2013 namely, better financial prospects \u2013 but under the surface she detected something else. \u201cI could feel a viral phenomenon,\u201d she recalls. \u201cLike: \u2018My big brother\u2019s doing it, this kid from the neighbourhood is doing it, so I\u2019m gonna do it, too.\u2019 I was shocked by the magnetic feeling I had from it.\u201d</p> <p>The trip had a profound impact on Diop. One young man told her that \u201cwhen you decide to cross the ocean, it means that you\u2019re already dead\u201d. She soon began to feel that the boys she spoke to \u201cwere not here any more\u201d, and her perception of the country\u2019s landscape began to alter. \u201cI started to watch the ocean. I was not looking at it like I used to; it became like a grave.\u201d</p> <p>The result of that visit was a non-fiction piece called Atlantiques, in which a young man recounted his journey across the ocean. Now, 11 years on, the French director is gearing up to release her debut feature film of nearly the same name, Atlantics. This time, however, she has poured the otherworldly impressions of that 2008 visit into a work of odd, fantastical fiction. What starts out as a portrait of a group of young Senegalese labourers risking their lives to reach Europe soon gives way to a bubbly, edgy teen movie centred on a young girl called Ada (played by Mama San\u00e9). It then transforms into a cop caper/whodunnit. Finally the film mutates into a supernatural horror, replete with spooky graveyards, mystery illnesses, paranormal arson and white-eyed zombie-like creatures dead set on revenge.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4s9n5x-kz4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X4s9n5x-kz4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There is, it is fair to say, a lot going on in Atlantics, which has the backing of the streaming giant Netflix. And its heady synthesis of styles has already caused a significant stir. In June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/16/atlantique-review-cannes-mati-diop-senegal-mystery\">it won the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/16/atlantique-review-cannes-mati-diop-senegal-mystery\">second biggest prize at Cannes</a>, where Diop was the first black female film-maker to compete in the main competition in the festival\u2019s history. In August, she won the Mary Pickford award for outstanding female talent at the Toronto film festival. Shortly before we meet, it is announced that Atlantics will be Senegal\u2019s submission for the Academy Award for best international feature film.</p> <p>Today, Diop is not keen to dwell on her history-making festival stint. \u201cI think this situation is really behind me now,\u201d she says, describing the emphasis on the statistic in press coverage of Atlantics as \u201cfrustrating\u201d. She is, however, enthused by the Oscar nod, along with the other ways the film has helped her connect with her Senegalese heritage. Born in France to a French mother, Diop has said that creating the character of Ada was a way of experiencing \u201cthe African adolescence that I hadn\u2019t lived\u201d, a psychological exercise that helped her reconcile the two strands of her ancestry. \u201cAs a mixed [-race] girl, there\u2019s always a visible and invisible side of you; there\u2019s a place you inhabit and place you desert,\u201d she says. \u201cHow does the place that you don\u2019t live in influence you?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a4c5bdea91aa98a6055004bdbd1b101175a516c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a4c5bdea91aa98a6055004bdbd1b101175a516c/0_2_1795_1077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traore as Souleiman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traore as Souleiman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Diop was also keen to push back against the western media\u2019s refugee narrative, whether it be coldly statistical or paralysingly sentimental. The original short was \u201creally about the reappropriation of its own story at a time when the approach in the media was only through the prism of economics,\u201d says Diop. \u201cIt was important to hear about this situation from another perspective, to humanise it. And when I say humanise it, it doesn\u2019t mean to be over-empathic, and try to make people cry and feel horrible about themselves.\u201d That said, she is not prepared to discuss the particulars of the French media\u2019s coverage of migration. \u201cI prefer to talk about my own relationship to that rather than going through an analysis of how the mass media treats this subject.\u201d</p> <p>Diop discusses her work with a fastidiousness and solemnity that reverberates through her entire person. She is especially scrupulous about the language used to frame her films. A description of the original Atlantiques as being about a young man\u2019s journey from Senegal to Spain is rebutted, \u201cbecause if it was that it would be very general. It\u2019s not me doing a short film about migration; it\u2019s a film into which a boy tells his own experience of crossing [the sea] to his two close friends and me.\u201d Neither should the short be referred to as a documentary. \u201cI call it a short film. Some people need to put a very strict frontier between documentary and fiction. I just don\u2019t consider cinema this way. I make films. I tell stories.\u201d</p> <p>One of Atlantics\u2019 impressively large number of narrative strands follows Ada\u2019s adolescent rebellion, and the film does an excellent job of evoking the texture of teenage life, beautifully capturing the schedule-free days, the intoxicating effect of rebellious friends, the ache and promise of first love. Coming-of-age stories are what make Diop tick. \u201cI\u2019ve always been very interested in adolescence, and because I\u2019m 37, it\u2019s both very far away and very close to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI love teenage movies, I love comedies about teenagers, I\u2019m a huge fan of [Kids director] Larry Clark.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/20/meet-the-new-directors-who-lit-up-the-film-festivals\">Meet the new directors who lit up the film festivals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During her own teen years, Diop found herself compelled to express herself creatively, but struggled to settle on one medium.

      "bodyText": "Coca-Cola has been named the world\u2019s largest polluter of plastics for the second year in a row, according to an audit conducted by Break Free From Plastic. The environmental justice group asked 72,541 volunteers in 51 countries to collect plastic waste. Almost half (43%) of what they found were clearly marked consumer brands. Coca-Cola was named the world\u2019s number one global plastic polluter, followed by Nestl\u00e9 and Pepsico. Volunteers were able to select the locations for their clean-up efforts and so the final results may not be a perfect representation of global trends. Nonetheless, almost 12,000 Coca-Cola products were found in 37 countries across the world. There were some regional trends too. In the US, the biggest producers of plastic pollution were Nestl\u00e9, followed by Solo Cup Company and Starbucks. In Europe, Heineken was the third-largest plastic polluter. Volunteers found more than 59,000 plastic bags, 53,000 sachets and 29,000 plastic bottles. No one really knows how long plastics will take to decompose in our oceans but estimates suggest that it takes up to 450 years for a plastic bottle to break down. \u201cAny time our packaging ends up in our oceans \u2013 or anywhere that it doesn\u2019t belong \u2013 is unacceptable to us,\u201d Coca-Cola said in a statement to the Intercept. \u201cIn partnership with others, we are working to address this critical global issue, both to help turn off the tap in terms of plastic waste entering our oceans and to help clean up the existing pollution.\u201d",

Because a woman\u2019s virginity was so valuable to men, people felt they needed a way of proving it. So, long ago, some bright spark decided that a random bit of tissue that sits just inside the entrance to a woman\u2019s vagina would act as proof that his daughter was definitely a virgin. This idea spread far and wide \u2013 so much so that many cultures have an ancient tradition of holding up the bedsheet of a newly married couple to show the wife\u2019s blood, to \u201cprove\u201d she was a virgin. In medieval times there was even advice about how to fake this blood if you weren\u2019t a virgin.

Another little-known fact is that this hole is stretchy enough to fit a whole penis through. And if you do break your hymen, it heals, just like every other flap of tissue in your body. Many women, of course, do bleed during their first time, and think this is because they\u2019ve broken their hymen. But in reality, this bleeding is usually caused by friction burns \u2013 for a number of reasons, many women aren\u2019t wet enough for comfortable penetration on their first time, so they bleed from friction.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t new information: scientists have been <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/317c/f15775b84434bf1a24689f55968e57eb9233.pdf\" title=\"\">refuting</a> the use of the hymen as proof of virginity for a long time.

But if TI does want to make sure his daughter has a happy sex life, he\u2019s doing a few things wrong. What girls and all young people need to hear is that virginity is a heteronormative, patriarchal and unscientific social construct, not a physical thing between your legs. If there is such a thing as virginity, then you arguably have many \u201cvirginities\u201d: your first kiss, your first wank, your first hand job \u2013 all of these virginities can be as important or exciting as the first time you are vaginially penetrated by a penis, if that is something you ever choose to do.</p> <p>Sex can and should be amazingly fun, not something to fear.

ER was just as big, and yet even though this September marked its 25th anniversary, there has been none of the fanfare accorded to Friends. And this despite the fact that ER looks way more modern than almost all its contemporaries.</p> <p>Anyone born after 1990 may have got the impression from the endless articles about the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/friends-netflix-sexist-racist-transphobic-problematic-millenials-watch-a8154626.html\" title=\"\">shocking unwokeness of Friends</a> that 90s TV was just a wasteland of whiteness: wealthy middle-class people leading heteronormative lives, pausing only to crack an occasional homophobic joke. Well, my dear millennials and gen Z-ers, allow me to direct you to ER. Aside from its notably, and realistically, inclusive cast (a black female boss; a disabled gay female boss), in just its first two seasons ER dealt with homophobia, transphobia, Aids, racism and white-collar poverty. While US politicians were still sneering about the crack epidemic among poor African-Americans, ER pointedly featured white characters from all social classes addicted to opioids. It even got into #MeToo, two decades ahead of time, through the character of Dr Ross (George Clooney, duh), who sleeps with a medical student.</p> <p>All this makes ER sound very po-faced, when my baby and I can tell you that it is just really, really good. But while I can talk at length about ER\u2019s best moments (in order: when Dr Greene causes the death of a woman during childbirth; when Dr Ross rescues a boy from a drain; and when Dr Carter is stabbed), there is something about the show generally that feels especially comforting right now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/07/er-television-drama\">Lucy Mangan bids farewell to a ER, the show that revolutionalised TV drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>ER is, as the cliche goes, about the adults in the room, and unlike more recent medical dramas \u2013 Gray\u2019s Anatomy, House \u2013 each episode is as invested in the patients as it is the doctors. Yes, the doctors all have their individual emotional dramas, but I\u2019m a lot less interested in those this time round than I am in watching them just do their jobs. Look at them, these selfless and brilliant grownups, trying to fix the broken people! Watch as they turn down high-paying jobs in fancy practices so they can help those who really need them! It\u2019s a show that celebrates empathy and expertise; against a backdrop of endless news from President Trump and Prime Minister Johnson, two men who are decidedly lacking in either of those qualities, ER is almost erotica. Some friends tell me they get this from watching old episodes of The West Wing, but that show feels a little too on the nose to me right now, a little too sad-making. So instead, I watch Dr Benton shout at Dr Carter as they crack open some unconscious guy\u2019s ribs, and I feel that bit more hopeful about mankind.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a kind of relief to opt out of the exhausting race to keep up with whatever the current prestige box set du jour is, sinking instead into the delights of a show made in 1994. So I\u2019m maintaining my strict regimen of at least four episodes of ER a night. I might be back at work, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to snap entirely back into the real world.

      "bodyText": "Wayne Bennett has never made much of a distinction between England and the \u2018revived\u2019 Great Britain rugby league team - so when the coach said \u201cwe\u2019ve gone backwards\u201d, it was clear he wasn\u2019t referring to the last time the Lions played, 12 years ago. The 69-year-old Australian, whose contract with the Rugby Football League expires next week, reckoned Great Britain\u2019s 23-8 defeat by New Zealand at Christchurch\u2019s OrangeTheory Stadium indicated \u2018we\u2019 - that\u2019s England - had regressed three years in their level of competitiveness. He had just seen Britain remain winless in their first three internationals since 2007, a South Pacific tour that has so far included one loss to Tonga and two to the Kiwis - who England beat 2-1 in a home series a year ago. \u201cWe\u2019re back to where we were in 2016 when I first came in as coach,\u201d said Bennett, again refusing to differentiate between the two entities. \u201cWe\u2019re not respecting the opposition enough with how much discipline we have to play with. \u201cI\u2019m not happy we\u2019re going backwards. I think we\u2019ve gone backwards a little bit from what last year and the World Cup year was, compared with how we\u2019ve played this series.\u201d Great Britain have so far managed just three tries in as many matches on tour.

With Warrington stand-off Blake Austin incongruously playing on the wing and making an early error that led to a Kiwi try, the Lions once more struggled to sustain pressure or execute opportunities from good ball. When the try did come, in the 51st minute, it was a result of a wonderful late off-load from substitute Josh Jones that allowed hooker Josh Hodgson to score untouched against a relaxed and puzzled defence. \u201cI just knew the ref hadn\u2019t called \u2018held\u2019,\u201d the Salford forward said later. Aside from that, the Kiwis just turned the screw as they constructed a workmanlike win. Centre Joey Manu held off two defenders to plant the ball over the line early, scrum-half Shaun Johnson reprised his 2013 World Cup light-footedness, winger Ken Maumalo was unconcerned his entire body aside from one forearm was outside the field of play when he touched down. And, playing in front of his terminally ill father, winger Jamayne Isaako tendered five goals and a drop goal. Bennett wants to stay on. Upset at his style of play, his selections and his seeming failure to grasp the concept of Great Britain, many fans think otherwise with one online poll giving him just two per cent of the popular vote over the weekend. \u201cNext year and the World Cup year are the prime years,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThere are a lot players here who haven\u2019t played before.

      "body": "<p>In 1928 Margaret Mead published <em>Coming of Age in Samoa</em> in which she argued that the sulks and slammed doors of American teens had nothing to do with their hormones and everything to do with their picket-fenced parents. By way of evidence 27-year-old Mead used the findings from her recent anthropological fieldwork in the South Pacific. Samoan adolescents, she explained, were happy growing up to be just like Mum and Dad. There was no thought of rebellion, because there was nothing to rebel against. Gender was generously accommodating to girly-boys and boyish girls and, while monogamy was fine in principle, it was nothing to get steamed up about if you fell a bit short. As if this weren\u2019t all thrilling enough, Mead\u2019s publisher put a picture of a topless Samoan woman on the cover of her book. Naturally, it was a bestseller.</p> <p>Since its publication 90-odd years ago, there has been plenty of time to pick holes in Mead\u2019s masterwork, to call her out for being naive about what the Samoans were telling her; for effectively drawing up a personal manifesto for her own rackety preferences (three husbands, several female lovers); for drawing on tired tropes about sexy South Sea islanders. But the fact remains that Mead\u2019s account was the most public sign to date that there was a new kind of anthropology in town. It was anthropology as practised and promoted by Franz Boas at Columbia University, and involved looking at other cultures from a position of deep curiosity and respect rather than the assumption of superiority. According to this Boasian way of thinking, the Samoans were not simply a bunch of picturesque primitives whose slightly saucy customs represented a timeless way of being. They were, rather, sophisticated, self-aware people who had developed ways of doing things that worked for them. Today we call this openness to other people\u2019s reality \u201ccultural relativism\u201d.</p> <p>In this brilliantly written and deftly organised book, Charles King tells the story of how Boas and three of his most influential research assistants revolutionised the study of humankind in the first half of the 20th century. From a previous generation of social scientists they had inherited a narrative that assumed all humankind was embarked on an arduous journey from savagery to civilisation, a civilisation that looked remarkably like the US, or at least the bits that were still discernibly European. White supremacy was a given and you could work out how far behind everyone else was by measuring their heads and heels with callipers and doing some self-important and completely bogus calculations. From here it was a short jump for scientists to propose a rough and ready eugenics under the guise of progressive social hygiene. The criminals, people with learning difficulties and, ultimately, anyone you didn\u2019t like the look of could be forcibly sterilised for the sake of the greater good. This pernicious practice, King points out, was still going strong in the 1960s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"65cf351340e130a2c3d922bcc1f17fe4114a190f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65cf351340e130a2c3d922bcc1f17fe4114a190f/0_338_2973_1784/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Franz Boas looked at other cultures from a position of respect.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Franz Boas looked at other cultures from a position of respect.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Against such a bleak and exploitative model it should have been easy for the new anthropology to assert itself. But as King shows, Boas and his followers found it hard to earn the respect of the academic establishment. Boas was an immigrant German Jew who had come up through museum curatorship rather than the Ivy League. The fact that he was propounding a way of thinking that upended hierarchies of class and race didn\u2019t exactly help his case for tenure either. And his willingness to call out patriarchal dogma as nothing more than a bit of self-serving bluster explains why his three most important public mouthpieces were women: Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict and Zora Neale Hurston.</p> <p>Mead dominates King\u2019s book, perhaps because her rich and well-catalogued archive lies easily to hand in the Library of Congress. But a more compelling strand concerns Hurston, whose traces are comparatively scrappy. Boas encountered the young Hurston as a fledgling member of the Harlem Renaissance, a journalist and short-story writer of elegance and flair. But it wasn\u2019t long before \u201cPapa Franz\u201d had persuaded the Howard graduate to travel south to Florida and New Orleans and undertake what he called \u201csalvage anthropology\u201d and she described as collecting \u201cfolktales and jokes, verbal quips and half-true lies\u201d. For Hurston this was much more than an exercise in academic curiosity: she was returning to the community that she had left a decade earlier during the great migration and which she knew from the inside out. The result of this re-immersion was the auto-ethnographical <em>Mules and Men,</em> which she claimed contained nothing less than \u201cthe boiled down juice of human living\u201d. Two years later Hurston would return to fiction to produce her masterpiece, <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em>, which took that \u201cboiled down juice\u201d and reconstituted it triumphantly into novel form.</p> <p>Ruth Benedict, the third of Boas\u2019s female acolytes and popularisers, once claimed that the whole point of their brand of cultural anthropology was \u201cto make the world safe for human difference\u201d. Anyone reading this magnificent book must be forcibly struck by how lovely and yet how shaky Benedict\u2019s statement sounds today.

On Friday hot temperatures and strong winds sparked \u2013 at one point \u2013 an unprecedented 99 fires running simultaneously across the two states. The armed forces began airlifts to evacuate people from fire-threatened towns. \u201cThere was a huge and desperate focus to try and get firefighters, aircraft and emergency services to as many people in need as possible,\u201d said the New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons. \u201cBut the reality is, and we have heard the 000 calls, [that] many people were calling in to say that they were isolated or trapped \u2026 or frightened with what was surrounding them, but we simply could not [get into] some of these communities. And it took many hours to even make it through. \u201cWe can\u2019t rule out the really grave concerns that there could be more losses or indeed more fatalities as we get through and identify details across these fire grounds.\u201d Conditions eased with lower temperatures over Saturday but Fitzsimmons warned they would worsen again early next week, with similar fire conditions forecast, but over a far broader swathe of the state. \u201cAs we head into Tuesday \u2026 we\u2019re expecting another day of difficult fire danger conditions \u2026 [and] we\u2019re expecting a much larger geographic area across New South Wales to be affected by that worsening weather conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond that, as the news reports are indicating, we\u2019re expecting a cyclical pattern of weather, week after week after week, of increased, elevated fire dangers to come and go.\u201d Already, Fitzsimmons said, \u201cwe are seeing extraordinary fire behaviour \u2026 hostile, truly awful\u201d, fed by a dry fuel-load and fanned by strong winds. Fitzsimmons said the outlook for summer was dire. \u201cUnfortunately, over the coming months, there\u2019s no signal for rain but quite the opposite: above-average temperatures, below-average rainfall. We haven\u2019t got into the worst of our traditional fire danger period yet. Summer is only around the corner.\u201d Already this season fires have burnt out more than three times as much area as last fire season. Late on Saturday there were still more than 80 fires burning across NSW and Queensland, five of them at \u201cemergency warning\u201d level. Uncontrolled fires were also running in Western Australia with a bushfire breaking out in suburban Perth. Three WA regions were expected to go to \u201ccatastrophic\u201d warnings in coming days, as the state experiences extremely hot, dry and windy conditions. Morrison was asked directly whether he believed climate change had contributed to Australia\u2019s unprecedented early-season fires. \u201cMy only thoughts today are with those who have lost their lives and their families, the firefighters who are fighting the fires [and] the response effort that has to be delivered,\u201d he replied. But the mayor of Glen Innes Severn council on the New South Wales mid-north coast, Carol Sparks, who believes she has lost her house to the fires, said she held no doubts global warming was increasing the number and intensity of fires across Australia. \u201cWe are so impacted by drought and the lack of rain,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s climate change, there\u2019s no doubt about it. The whole of the country is going to be affected. We need to take a serious look at our future.\u201d Morrison said he was speaking with chiefs of Australia\u2019s defence forces over \u201ccontingency options\u201d for more military involvement. \u201cOur defence forces are not trained firefighters,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the ADF can provide a lot of support in logistics and other areas as required.\u201d Morrison said emergency service payments for people affected would be mobilised over the weekend \u2013 $1,000 per adult and $400 per child.",

It\u2019s No 1 on Amazon, has hit bestseller charts in the UK and the US, and has been shortlisted for the Waterstones book of the year. \u201cWe initially costed the book on 10,000 copies,\u201d said Ebury managing director, Joel Rickett. \u201cTwo weeks after publication we have 200,000 copies in print and we\u2019re scrambling to find the capacity to print another 100,000.\u201d According to Waterstones\u2019 Kate McHale, the hardback will be a key Christmas title. \u201cIt\u2019s doing exceptionally well,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been absolutely delighted \u2013 it\u2019s such a lovely book, about having courage in difficult times, about love and friendship and how that builds resilience, which makes it universal. People are coming in and buying multiple copies, for themselves and for their friends.\u201d Higginson said that readers \u2013 including one woman who bought 25 copies at an Oxford signing \u2013 were responding to Mackesy\u2019s ability to \u201cput just the right words and images together, as well as the universal values in the book\u201d. \u201cNo matter who you are, what age you are, what your belief system is, there are universal feelings and experiences which unite us all,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might sound fluffy but I think it has come out at the perfect time \u2013 it\u2019s the antidote to Brexit and its values just resonate.\u201d Mackesy confessed he was staggered by the book\u2019s success and fears people will \u201csuddenly realise it\u2019s not a very good book\u201d. \u201cSometimes I wake up in the middle of the night feeling incredibly vulnerable that I\u2019ve said these things and they\u2019re so widely looked at but that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hope it carries on helping people \u2026 Some, I\u2019m sure, will loathe it but for people who it encourages inspires and lifts \u2013 what a privilege!\u201d",

Andersen\u2019s chilly fable, brightened for a modern audience with original songs and a narrative spin that put the relationship between two sisters at its core, was renamed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/frozen\" title=\"\">Frozen</a>. At its premiere in 2013, Disney\u2019s chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/robert-iger\" title=\"\">Bob Iger</a>, wept behind his 3D glasses. And why not? Within weeks the movie had made more than $800m in worldwide bums-on-seats. Its soundtrack was No1. The DVD sold <a href=\"https://variety.com/2014/film/news/frozen-sells-3-2-million-dvd-blu-ray-discs-in-one-day-1201139509/\" title=\"\">3m copies in a </a><em><a href=\"https://variety.com/2014/film/news/frozen-sells-3-2-million-dvd-blu-ray-discs-in-one-day-1201139509/\" title=\"\">day</a></em>. Though a sequel has been slow in coming \u2013 Frozen II is in cinemas later this month \u2013 it has been an absolute inevitability, ever since somebody, somewhere, bought the clinching ticket or disc and Frozen moved past <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/11/the-lion-king-guard-disney-twenty-years\" title=\"\">The Lion King</a> to become the most successful animated film of all time.</p> <p>I was the father of a new baby girl when the Frozen madness began, back in 2013. In the tiny gaps between ninja nappy-wrapping and sprinting out on emergency Persil runs to the shops, I was vaguely aware of the arrival of a cultural phenomenon. I didn\u2019t know the specifics, nothing of the heroine-princess Elsa, her younger sister Anna, their gang of comic friends or their quest to save a frozen Scandinavian kingdom from ruin. I hadn\u2019t heard any of the songs which, people said, were wilier and more mischievous than the straighter, soapier, we\u2019re-in-love-now ballads that defined Disney movies past.</p> <p>My first exposure to the curious potency of Frozen\u2019s soundtrack came that first summer after its release. I had been sent to interview a footballer. When I arrived at his home he was running late, and I was parked in the kitchen with his children, who were playing the soundtrack on a loop. And I mean <em>loop</em>. This music, plainly, was as much a fixture of the home as the unliftable art books and nice rugs. One of the tracks, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgMN0Cfh-aQ\" title=\"\">For The First Time In Forever</a>, caught my ear. In the song, the two sisters consider a glamorous upcoming ball from two perspectives. Anna, the fun sister, can\u2019t wait: \u201cDon\u2019t know if I\u2019m elated or gassy,\u201d she sings, \u201cbut I\u2019m somewhere in that zo-o-o-ne!\u201d Elsa, secretly cursed with the power to shoot ice from her hands, is terrified: \u201cConceal! Don\u2019t feel! Put on a sho-o-o-w!\u201d</p> <p>I was amazed at how much character was packed into one short, pert song; how touching and unself-pitying it was. I went away intrigued, though not expecting to find out much more about Frozen for at least another 15 years, at which age my daughter, having been raised on a diet of leather-bound Dickens and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Bunraku\" title=\"\">Bunraku</a> mime, would be allowed to watch her first Hollywood film.</p> <p>We trick ourselves, any time we think we can curate a careful menu of things our kids will obsess over. Before my daughter was born, I had this idea it might be neat if I chose a pop song for her. The first piece of music her little ears would hear! I would play it as soon as we got her back from the hospital. As it was, in the cab taking us home, the driver slapped on the radio, we got <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc0mxOXbWIU&amp;has_verified=1\" title=\"\">Fuck You by Cee-Lo Green</a>, and that was that. Frozen was also my fault. We were days into a rained-off holiday in the countryside and the place had a DVD player plus a copy of the film. What could it hurt?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77977d9857de2958b7173d16711e5bb40693d840\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77977d9857de2958b7173d16711e5bb40693d840/0_0_595_349/500.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Frozen II, plus merchandise including soft toys and an Olaf backpack\" width=\"500\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Frozen II, plus merchandise including soft toys and an Olaf backpack.

Arranged cushions. We sat and watched the thing, and she surprised me, when the baddie did an embarrassing bad-guy dance, by gurgling out a laugh. I could almost see the mental connections fusing, that weird human delight taking shape in the interplay between humiliation and amusement. Before long we had watched Frozen a second time, then a third. It became one of our things. \u201cFer-zen,\u201d she called it.</p> <p>Recently I spoke to the movie\u2019s co-directors, Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, about this. I was not the first to offer \u201cFrozen dad\u201d feedback: Lee described the gruff, unimpressible, fortysomething men who would come bounding up, \u201cbreathlessly, saying things like, \u2018Anna loves too much. That\u2019s her problem. And that\u2019s her <em>strength.\u2019</em>\u201d Buck said: \u201cFathers and daughters are the fans I find most fascinating. The dads enjoy the movie on its own merits, but it gives them a connection with their daughters they may not have had before. A way in.\u201d</p> <p>Ten viewings, 15. In these early innocent stages (mere foothills of a coming obsession), my daughter seemed to like the wacky supporting characters best: a brought-to-life snowman, Olaf, waddling about at waist height; a lonely mountain-man, Kristoff, who gets a little song about preferring his pet reindeer to people. The film\u2019s final song features musical trolls who band together for a topsy-turvy dance number about learning to tolerate people\u2019s flaws. These trolls, I eventually noticed, somewhere around the 20th or 25th viewing, had been snuck a cheeky line in which they speculated that Kristoff and his reindeer enjoyed a relationship \u201ca little outside of nature\u2019s laws\u201d.</p> <p>Of all the un-Disneyish subjects: bestiality. I must have gasped. \u201cWhat? What?\u201d my daughter asked, while I winced and bit my tongue. Here was that flattering sense, well known to parent-chaperones at Pixar movies, of a gag aimed over the heads of the kids for the grownups. Elsewhere in Frozen, in a patch of apparently innocent repartee, the film-makers slipped in a penis joke. Anna is asked about a prospective boyfriend\u2019s foot size, and snaps back: \u201cFoot size doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I asked Lee and Buck whether there\u2019d been any debate about this and Lee roared. \u201cDid not debate it at all. We were improv-ing in the room and the line just came out\u2026 You\u2019re the first person to bring that up.\u201d I could hardly bring myself to admit just how many times I\u2019d seen the film. Forty? Fifty? I knew it backwards. I had half the dance moves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"39134c4e88629a94793da6ca8ff2f62c87a31462\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39134c4e88629a94793da6ca8ff2f62c87a31462/211_117_1406_2527/556.jpg\" alt=\"Frozen co-directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee accept the Golden Globe award for Best Animated Feature Film on January 12 2014 in Beverly Hills, California\" width=\"556\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Co-directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee with their Golden Globe. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was obvious pride, for these film-makers, that their Frozen should ever have ridden the zeitgeist like this. An initial pitch, in 2008 or 2009, that Elsa and Anna did not need boyfriend-saviours and might in fact save themselves, must have sounded pretty revolutionary in Disney\u2019s Burbank studios. (I\u2019m thinking Lenin pitching the Russians: no more tsars.) But Buck and Lee got the idea through and the resulting film turns on a moment of familial, not romantic, love. Kristoff and an oily prince called Hans yap about, gesturing at being the hero, before winding up as arm candy for Anna, an irrelevance to Elsa.</p> <p>I had some beautiful chats with my daughter about this. As she grew up and changed, the world was changing, too. Often, when our larger talks stuttered, it was Frozen and its intimately known beats that we referred back to. The movie became something like a demonstration table, from which colourful examples from life could be picked up and placed down.</p> <p>\u201cSo you know how Anna starts off thinking that getting married to Hans is the only thing that matters\u2026?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</p> <p>As with a great many Disney movies, the plot of Frozen requires that the lead characters be orphans. In order to keep the plot brisk and economical, the parents die early, in a shipwreck. This happens mid-song, their ship going down under a wave during a storm. Lee explained that they didn\u2019t want to linger on a \u201cBambi moment\u201d. Watching through adult eyes, I always found this a deft piece of storytelling. It never occurred to me that my daughter had missed anything, not til our 45th or 50th viewing came to an end, with the winter-struck kingdom returned to sunshine and prosperity.</p> <p>There had been more and more talk, online, about a Frozen sequel. I asked my daughter, idly, what she thought would happen next to the sisters. She yawned, throwing out her lengthening limbs into a massive, contented, after-movie stretch. She said something about Elsa and Anna\u2019s parents <em>finally</em> getting home from their sea voyage.</p> <p>Silence on the sofa. The credits rolled. \u201cOh, baby,\u201d I began. Deep breath. And so we had our first conversation about death.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Frozen mugs. Frozen T-shirts. Frozen Crayola. Frozen Lego.

Around the time that Frozen\u2019s turnover passed the $1bn mark, with Disney stock soaring, chief executive Iger went on an open call to investors and promised Frozen video games, Frozen theme park attractions, \u201cnot just new product but continued interest and continued impact on the bottom line for quite a while\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"924e6e96f1e84af3c482df82023c2f48b8439224\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/924e6e96f1e84af3c482df82023c2f48b8439224/0_177_4888_3824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children at a Frozen party, dressed as the film's characters DO NOT USE.

Lee, who had cast her daughter in a small role in the movie (voicing a nine-year-old Anna), went out shopping one day and came across a miniature Frozen tandem. When you pressed a button on the basket, an excerpt of her daughter\u2019s singing voice crackled out. At Disney\u2019s Florida theme park they got an <a href=\"https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/en_GB/attractions/epcot/frozen-ever-after/\" title=\"\">Anna and Elsa-themed log flume</a>. In the California park, they got an <a href=\"https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2014/10/anna-elsas-boutique-opens-in-downtown-disney-district-at-the-disneyland-resort/\" title=\"\">Anna and Elsa\u2019s Boutique</a>.</p> <p>After a couple of Christmases as a Frozen parent, I was living in what amounted to an Anna and Elsa\u2019s Boutique myself. Pencil case. Indoor football. Bedspread with matching pillowcase. We had affiliated Frozen tat of every conceivable size, purpose and quality, from tiny, self-assembly characters out of Kinder eggs to solid plastic figurines, heavy as murder weapons, that presented Anna in two \u201clooks\u201d, her ball look and her winter travelling look. There was an official Frozen picture book and some unofficial Frozen lip salve.</p> <p>Prized above everything, by my daughter, was a cloaked Elsa dress. It came with Elsa gloves, an Elsa wand and an Elsa braid. For her fourth birthday, we were able to find an inflatables guy who had painted a plausible Elsa on his bouncy castle and was touring it, one step ahead of the patent lawyers, I expect, around kids\u2019 parties. My daughter came in character, as Elsa. A dozen other little girls came in character, all as Elsas. On the way home, I asked her what the deal was with Elsa: \u201cShe\u2019s <em>cursed</em>. She never smiles. Anna\u2019s the fun one! Why does nobody ever dress up as Anna?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e190d7785946bd2a5fd47f091b64cca22e81293c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e190d7785946bd2a5fd47f091b64cca22e81293c/343_73_2353_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, winners of Best Song Written for Visual Media for Let It Go and Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media for Frozen, at the Grammy Awards, February 8 2015, in Los Angeles, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"842\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez with their Frozen Grammys.

Elsa was surly. I asked Frozen\u2019s songwriters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/18/robert-lopez-kristen-anderson-lopez-frozen-chardonnay-coco\" title=\"\">Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez</a>, a married couple who\u2019d written the music and lyrics in a tiny office above a Greek bakery in Brooklyn. Kristen had noticed the Elsa-Anna imbalance, too, counting the kids who came by their house every Halloween and putting the ratio at 12:1. She shrugged. \u201cElsa is sparkly. Otherworldly. Anna is only human.\u201d</p> <p>One day, recently, I called up Elsa herself \u2013 the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/idina-menzel\" title=\"\">Idina Menzel</a>, a big-voiced Broadway veteran (Rent, Wicked) who was in her early 40s when she was cast as Frozen\u2019s lead in 2012. Menzel was in the middle of recording an album of Christmas songs when we spoke. She admitted that, growing up, she wasn\u2019t much of a fan of Disney princesses. \u201cBut don\u2019t tell <em>them</em> that. I think Disney\u2019s gotten a lot better, since then, at making empowering female characters.\u201d As for Elsa\u2019s strange magnetism, Menzel puts it down to the fact that Elsa, as with many young women, has too often been told what not to do.</p> <p>Casual and funny, a fortysomething with dark hair, the actor does not share many surface qualities with Elsa, a buttoned-up Scandinavian ice-teen. But, Menzel says, \u201cI can relate. When I was young, I had this bi-i-i-g voice. People would talk about it, say I had a gift, yet I didn\u2019t want to show it off, in case people thought I was bragging. So you end up taking a strength and burying it. That\u2019s not something that goes away. As women we work on it all the time. We\u2019re always wrestling with, \u2018How much is too much? How big is too big?\u2019 When you speak your mind, your anger, your ferocity \u2013 when is that OK, when is that <em>allowed</em>, as a woman?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"641ae68b4297b4347364b310a167ef36db23fc09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/641ae68b4297b4347364b310a167ef36db23fc09/0_236_1238_1269/976.jpg\" alt=\"Children at a Frozen party, dressed as the film's characters DO NOT USE.

At this point she abruptly stops giving a hoot and, whipping off her gloves, letting down her hair, she conjures up an ice fortress, a snow demon, plus a cool new frosty disco dress. From the earliest screenings, it was clear to all that Let It Go was Frozen\u2019s centrepiece triumph, its money-maker and access-all-areas pass, eventual winner of an Oscar for Best Song and a Grammy. The Lopezes told me they first wrote it under the working title of Elsa\u2019s Badass Moment, while walking in a Brooklyn park.</p> <p>The song had to express a release of pent-up, unsayable truths. Kristen channelled some of the frustrations she had at the time, \u201craising a two-year-old and a six-year-old, trying to have a career, trying to have a good marriage, trying to stay skinny. Expectations can be so high, for what we are allowed to be. I thought, what would happen if I just let all that go?\u201d Days after Frozen\u2019s release, at a time when the lunatic power of Let It Go was starting to become plain, Disney fed a coming craze by putting the unabridged song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moSFlvxnbgk\" title=\"\">on YouTube</a>. It has since been viewed 675m times. A month later, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU\" title=\"\">sing</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU\" title=\"\">a</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU\" title=\"\">long version</a> went live, complete with lyrics and bouncing snowflake. An absurd 1.8bn views.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift\" title=\"\">Taylor Swift</a> covered Let It Go on tour, as did <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMlAfORXUYU\" title=\"\">Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam</a>, another Frozen dad.

The karaoke company <a href=\"https://www.luckyvoice.com/\" title=\"\">Lucky Voice</a> said that Let It Go was its most-sung track of 2015. And 2016. And 2017.

And we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re staying in that lane.\u201d He meant, in the sequel, Elsa would #NotBeGettingAGirlfriend. Lee cut in: \u201cBut what we love is that people see themselves in her, [especially] anyone who feels that they have a part of themselves that needs release.\u201d</p> <p>Who knows? Future instalments of the franchise might go to braver places. There have been plans to keep taking the story further. When I spoke to Menzel, she had just been on a night out with her co-star Jonathan Groff, the voice of mountain-man Kristoff. Groff had described the first movie as a seed and the second movie as a sprout. Something like that. Menzel couldn\u2019t quite remember. She paused our conversation and took out her phone. \u201cI\u2019m gonna text him right now. Hold on there. I\u2019m texting Kristoff while we speak.\u201d After many journeys on the fixed rails of Frozen\u2019s plot, there was something so thrillingly off-book about a text pinging between Elsa and Kristoff that I could hardly sit still.</p> <p>I wondered what my daughter would make of it. Menzel chuckled. \u201cTell your daughter \u2018Hi\u2019 from me. Tell her some old lady with dark brown hair says \u2018Hi\u2019. That\u2019ll freak her out.\u201d I said I would.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The Lopezes have a story about how they were once in a Disney store before Christmas, queueing to buy Frozen toys with everybody else. Their songs were playing on an endless loop out of a speaker and when the Lopezes got to the front of the queue, hoping to curry favour with the server and perhaps get some sort of discount, they mentioned they\u2019d written Let It Go. The server looked at them, as the songs played and played, and asked: \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>Robert told me: \u201cAt first our friends and neighbours used to say, \u2018Thank you for writing these songs, you\u2019ve brought our family together.\u2019 And then\u2026\u201d He laughed. \u201cAnd then it started to shift.\u201d His wife, Kristen, referred to something she called \u201cmini-van fatigue\u201d: too many road journeys, too many restarts of the CD. When I asked Lee about the most common parental response to her movie now, she answered drily: \u201cFrozen has cost me a lot of money.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"df6094a7b29c7fb03f2f655914a47f4b2def9a81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6094a7b29c7fb03f2f655914a47f4b2def9a81/330_144_1638_3216/509.jpg\" alt=\"Idina Menzel (on left) and Kristen Bell, the voices of Elsa and Anna in the film Frozen\" width=\"509\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Idina Menzel (on left) and Kristen Bell, the voices of Elsa and Anna.

But the Lopezes said they were most intrigued by the challenge of ageing a group of obsessed-over characters. Lee told me that, before writing the script, she plunged into books about Elizabeth I\u2019s reign, seeking ideas about where to take Elsa next. She was looking over the heads of the kids who might have come and gone as Frozen fans, eyeballing the next generation. \u201cBefore the first Frozen, I asked myself: what did I wish had been there for me as a child? And it was a heroine who was not perfect, who struggled, who wasn\u2019t good or evil, and wasn\u2019t pitted against other women. Same with Frozen II. I sat down and thought, what would have helped?\u201d</p> <p>Lopez mentioned geopolitics in this context. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been through crises in the last few years,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an anxiety level we all share. We wanted to show how our characters would deal with that, too.\u201d I wasn\u2019t able to see the sequel but \u2013 just a guess \u2013 look out for set-piece songs in which Elsa refreezes the melting icecaps. Anna votes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Warren</a>. Olaf gets Brexit done.</p> <p>Or maybe not. Disney will not want <em>too</em> many risks taken with its golden franchise. In spring this year, the company announced that Frozen The Musical would open around the world, in Sydney, Hamburg and <a href=\"https://www.frozenthemusical.co.uk/\" title=\"\">London</a>. Meanwhile building work was under way on a <a href=\"http://seasons.disneylandparis.com/en-gb/frozen-celebration?ecid=SEM_IP_S_1781101125-c-83038505750-416433944639-386670860796-Broad&amp;mkwid=gufgNgUI&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjYrE1snG5QIVmLPtCh1YIgniEAAYASAAEgLRjfD_BwE\" title=\"\">Frozen realm at Disneyland Paris</a>, a deal that elicited an excited <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emmanuelmacron/status/968482244003356672?lang=en\" title=\"\">tweet from President Macron</a>. Plans were announced to sell Frozen coding kits. A Frozen quad bike. Back on Broadway, they sold their millionth ticket.</p> <p>I went along, ducking in to see the musical during a work trip. While a real-life Elsa roamed the stage, her ice powers simulated with flashing lights and dry ice, I did my best to watch it through my daughter\u2019s eyes. I wanted to remember all the tiny details, to ferry them back to her in London. I could hardly wait.</p> <p>She had just turned six. We\u2019d been Frozen nuts, together, for more than half her life. I used to think that, because of her, I had seen Frozen more times than any other movie. More recently I\u2019d begun to wonder if I\u2019d seen Frozen more times than all other movies put together. There was no longer a question of irritation or fatigue: Frozen was simply a fact of parenting life, same as getting up early, having a sore back, worrying.</p> <p>It was while I was away in New York that my daughter was taken to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/25/matilda-review\" title=\"\">Matilda in London</a>. Her first West End show! This came after a summer of fascination with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/womens-world-cup-2019\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s World Cup</a>, reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/sep/11/the-worst-witch-jill-murphy-review\" title=\"\">The Worst Witch</a> books and liking Wonder Woman. When I got home, she listened politely to my stories about Frozen The Musical, then went back to recreating the big number from Matilda, the one about kids who are desperate to get on and grow up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our daughters have grown up. Now they\u2019re into Hamilton, Billie Eilish, YouTube ukelele stars</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One day she came to find me, with the air of someone who\u2019d been sitting on a big confession for a while. Deep breath. She admitted she\u2019d started to find Frozen boring. Babyish. She would come and see the sequel with me (a concession to my feelings). But the fact was she had other favourites. We hugged. I thought of the time she first teetered away, walking, or spent a whole morning at nursery by herself \u2013 fantastic new beginnings that also marked, unequivocally, an end.</p> <p>I needed to vent some of this to wiser ears. Who better than the songwriting Lopezes, emotionally nimble enough to stuff one single film with the biggest pop song of the decade (Let It Go), a masterpiece of musical storytelling (For The First Time In Forever) <em>and</em> a sneaky joke about bestiality? I explained that my daughter had pushed through the other side, gone post-Frozen. Was it weird that I felt so distraught?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable,\u201d Kristen said. \u201cWe had the same.

Going into the unknown. Facing some of the fears we all have around change.\u201d The family had just that week been to a screening of Frozen II, Kristen said. It turned out that even the 14-year-old Billie Eilish fan could get back into Anna and Elsa for a night.</p> <p>\u201cWe talked about it the whole car ride home,\u201d Kristen said. \u201cThey\u2019re kind, sweet girls.

      "bodyText": "If we go by Disney\u2019s in-house lore, the idea of making a movie of Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s The Snow Queen had been kicking around for more than 70 years by the time it was green-lit. Andersen\u2019s chilly fable, brightened for a modern audience with original songs and a narrative spin that put the relationship between two sisters at its core, was renamed Frozen. At its premiere in 2013, Disney\u2019s chief executive, Bob Iger, wept behind his 3D glasses. And why not? Within weeks the movie had made more than $800m in worldwide bums-on-seats. Its soundtrack was No1. The DVD sold 3m copies in a day. Though a sequel has been slow in coming \u2013 Frozen II is in cinemas later this month \u2013 it has been an absolute inevitability, ever since somebody, somewhere, bought the clinching ticket or disc and Frozen moved past The Lion King to become the most successful animated film of all time. I was the father of a new baby girl when the Frozen madness began, back in 2013. In the tiny gaps between ninja nappy-wrapping and sprinting out on emergency Persil runs to the shops, I was vaguely aware of the arrival of a cultural phenomenon. I didn\u2019t know the specifics, nothing of the heroine-princess Elsa, her younger sister Anna, their gang of comic friends or their quest to save a frozen Scandinavian kingdom from ruin. I hadn\u2019t heard any of the songs which, people said, were wilier and more mischievous than the straighter, soapier, we\u2019re-in-love-now ballads that defined Disney movies past. My first exposure to the curious potency of Frozen\u2019s soundtrack came that first summer after its release. I had been sent to interview a footballer. When I arrived at his home he was running late, and I was parked in the kitchen with his children, who were playing the soundtrack on a loop. And I mean loop. This music, plainly, was as much a fixture of the home as the unliftable art books and nice rugs. One of the tracks, For The First Time In Forever, caught my ear. In the song, the two sisters consider a glamorous upcoming ball from two perspectives. Anna, the fun sister, can\u2019t wait: \u201cDon\u2019t know if I\u2019m elated or gassy,\u201d she sings, \u201cbut I\u2019m somewhere in that zo-o-o-ne!\u201d Elsa, secretly cursed with the power to shoot ice from her hands, is terrified: \u201cConceal! Don\u2019t feel! Put on a sho-o-o-w!\u201d I was amazed at how much character was packed into one short, pert song; how touching and unself-pitying it was. I went away intrigued, though not expecting to find out much more about Frozen for at least another 15 years, at which age my daughter, having been raised on a diet of leather-bound Dickens and Bunraku mime, would be allowed to watch her first Hollywood film. We trick ourselves, any time we think we can curate a careful menu of things our kids will obsess over. Before my daughter was born, I had this idea it might be neat if I chose a pop song for her. The first piece of music her little ears would hear! I would play it as soon as we got her back from the hospital. As it was, in the cab taking us home, the driver slapped on the radio, we got Fuck You by Cee-Lo Green, and that was that. Frozen was also my fault. We were days into a rained-off holiday in the countryside and the place had a DVD player plus a copy of the film. What could it hurt? I brought in snacks. Arranged cushions. We sat and watched the thing, and she surprised me, when the baddie did an embarrassing bad-guy dance, by gurgling out a laugh. I could almost see the mental connections fusing, that weird human delight taking shape in the interplay between humiliation and amusement. Before long we had watched Frozen a second time, then a third. It became one of our things. \u201cFer-zen,\u201d she called it. Recently I spoke to the movie\u2019s co-directors, Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, about this. I was not the first to offer \u201cFrozen dad\u201d feedback: Lee described the gruff, unimpressible, fortysomething men who would come bounding up, \u201cbreathlessly, saying things like, \u2018Anna loves too much. That\u2019s her problem. And that\u2019s her strength.\u2019\u201d Buck said: \u201cFathers and daughters are the fans I find most fascinating. The dads enjoy the movie on its own merits, but it gives them a connection with their daughters they may not have had before. A way in.\u201d Ten viewings, 15. In these early innocent stages (mere foothills of a coming obsession), my daughter seemed to like the wacky supporting characters best: a brought-to-life snowman, Olaf, waddling about at waist height; a lonely mountain-man, Kristoff, who gets a little song about preferring his pet reindeer to people. The film\u2019s final song features musical trolls who band together for a topsy-turvy dance number about learning to tolerate people\u2019s flaws. These trolls, I eventually noticed, somewhere around the 20th or 25th viewing, had been snuck a cheeky line in which they speculated that Kristoff and his reindeer enjoyed a relationship \u201ca little outside of nature\u2019s laws\u201d. Of all the un-Disneyish subjects: bestiality. I must have gasped. \u201cWhat? What?\u201d my daughter asked, while I winced and bit my tongue. Here was that flattering sense, well known to parent-chaperones at Pixar movies, of a gag aimed over the heads of the kids for the grownups. Elsewhere in Frozen, in a patch of apparently innocent repartee, the film-makers slipped in a penis joke. Anna is asked about a prospective boyfriend\u2019s foot size, and snaps back: \u201cFoot size doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I asked Lee and Buck whether there\u2019d been any debate about this and Lee roared. \u201cDid not debate it at all. We were improv-ing in the room and the line just came out\u2026 You\u2019re the first person to bring that up.\u201d I could hardly bring myself to admit just how many times I\u2019d seen the film. Forty? Fifty? I knew it backwards. I had half the dance moves. There was obvious pride, for these film-makers, that their Frozen should ever have ridden the zeitgeist like this. An initial pitch, in 2008 or 2009, that Elsa and Anna did not need boyfriend-saviours and might in fact save themselves, must have sounded pretty revolutionary in Disney\u2019s Burbank studios. (I\u2019m thinking Lenin pitching the Russians: no more tsars.) But Buck and Lee got the idea through and the resulting film turns on a moment of familial, not romantic, love. Kristoff and an oily prince called Hans yap about, gesturing at being the hero, before winding up as arm candy for Anna, an irrelevance to Elsa. I had some beautiful chats with my daughter about this. As she grew up and changed, the world was changing, too. Often, when our larger talks stuttered, it was Frozen and its intimately known beats that we referred back to. The movie became something like a demonstration table, from which colourful examples from life could be picked up and placed down. \u201cSo you know how Anna starts off thinking that getting married to Hans is the only thing that matters\u2026?\u201d \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d As with a great many Disney movies, the plot of Frozen requires that the lead characters be orphans. In order to keep the plot brisk and economical, the parents die early, in a shipwreck. This happens mid-song, their ship going down under a wave during a storm. Lee explained that they didn\u2019t want to linger on a \u201cBambi moment\u201d. Watching through adult eyes, I always found this a deft piece of storytelling. It never occurred to me that my daughter had missed anything, not til our 45th or 50th viewing came to an end, with the winter-struck kingdom returned to sunshine and prosperity. There had been more and more talk, online, about a Frozen sequel. I asked my daughter, idly, what she thought would happen next to the sisters. She yawned, throwing out her lengthening limbs into a massive, contented, after-movie stretch. She said something about Elsa and Anna\u2019s parents finally getting home from their sea voyage. Silence on the sofa. The credits rolled. \u201cOh, baby,\u201d I began. Deep breath. And so we had our first conversation about death. *** Frozen mugs. Frozen T-shirts. Frozen Crayola. Frozen Lego. As of autumn-winter 2014, brides have been able to walk down the aisle in an authorised Frozen wedding dress, in ivory or in Elsa\u2019s trademark turquoise. Around the time that Frozen\u2019s turnover passed the $1bn mark, with Disney stock soaring, chief executive Iger went on an open call to investors and promised Frozen video games, Frozen theme park attractions, \u201cnot just new product but continued interest and continued impact on the bottom line for quite a while\u201d. Across America, a lottery system had to be introduced, to deal with the extent of shops\u2019 demand for merch. Lee, who had cast her daughter in a small role in the movie (voicing a nine-year-old Anna), went out shopping one day and came across a miniature Frozen tandem. When you pressed a button on the basket, an excerpt of her daughter\u2019s singing voice crackled out. At Disney\u2019s Florida theme park they got an Anna and Elsa-themed log flume. In the California park, they got an Anna and Elsa\u2019s Boutique. After a couple of Christmases as a Frozen parent, I was living in what amounted to an Anna and Elsa\u2019s Boutique myself. Pencil case. Indoor football. Bedspread with matching pillowcase. We had affiliated Frozen tat of every conceivable size, purpose and quality, from tiny, self-assembly characters out of Kinder eggs to solid plastic figurines, heavy as murder weapons, that presented Anna in two \u201clooks\u201d, her ball look and her winter travelling look. There was an official Frozen picture book and some unofficial Frozen lip salve. Prized above everything, by my daughter, was a cloaked Elsa dress. It came with Elsa gloves, an Elsa wand and an Elsa braid. For her fourth birthday, we were able to find an inflatables guy who had painted a plausible Elsa on his bouncy castle and was touring it, one step ahead of the patent lawyers, I expect, around kids\u2019 parties. My daughter came in character, as Elsa. A dozen other little girls came in character, all as Elsas. On the way home, I asked her what the deal was with Elsa: \u201cShe\u2019s cursed. She never smiles. Anna\u2019s the fun one! Why does nobody ever dress up as Anna?\u201d It made no sense. Anna was witty, gutsy. Elsa was surly. I asked Frozen\u2019s songwriters, Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, a married couple who\u2019d written the music and lyrics in a tiny office above a Greek bakery in Brooklyn. Kristen had noticed the Elsa-Anna imbalance, too, counting the kids who came by their house every Halloween and putting the ratio at 12:1. She shrugged. \u201cElsa is sparkly. Otherworldly. Anna is only human.\u201d One day, recently, I called up Elsa herself \u2013 the actor Idina Menzel, a big-voiced Broadway veteran (Rent, Wicked) who was in her early 40s when she was cast as Frozen\u2019s lead in 2012. Menzel was in the middle of recording an album of Christmas songs when we spoke. She admitted that, growing up, she wasn\u2019t much of a fan of Disney princesses. \u201cBut don\u2019t tell them that. I think Disney\u2019s gotten a lot better, since then, at making empowering female characters.\u201d As for Elsa\u2019s strange magnetism, Menzel puts it down to the fact that Elsa, as with many young women, has too often been told what not to do. Casual and funny, a fortysomething with dark hair, the actor does not share many surface qualities with Elsa, a buttoned-up Scandinavian ice-teen. But, Menzel says, \u201cI can relate. When I was young, I had this bi-i-i-g voice. People would talk about it, say I had a gift, yet I didn\u2019t want to show it off, in case people thought I was bragging. So you end up taking a strength and burying it. That\u2019s not something that goes away. As women we work on it all the time. We\u2019re always wrestling with, \u2018How much is too much? How big is too big?\u2019 When you speak your mind, your anger, your ferocity \u2013 when is that OK, when is that allowed, as a woman?\u201d In the first half of Frozen, audiences watch Elsa suppress her ice powers until a supreme second-act song called Let It Go. At this point she abruptly stops giving a hoot and, whipping off her gloves, letting down her hair, she conjures up an ice fortress, a snow demon, plus a cool new frosty disco dress. From the earliest screenings, it was clear to all that Let It Go was Frozen\u2019s centrepiece triumph, its money-maker and access-all-areas pass, eventual winner of an Oscar for Best Song and a Grammy. The Lopezes told me they first wrote it under the working title of Elsa\u2019s Badass Moment, while walking in a Brooklyn park. The song had to express a release of pent-up, unsayable truths. Kristen channelled some of the frustrations she had at the time, \u201craising a two-year-old and a six-year-old, trying to have a career, trying to have a good marriage, trying to stay skinny. Expectations can be so high, for what we are allowed to be. I thought, what would happen if I just let all that go?\u201d Days after Frozen\u2019s release, at a time when the lunatic power of Let It Go was starting to become plain, Disney fed a coming craze by putting the unabridged song on YouTube. It has since been viewed 675m times. A month later, a singalong version went live, complete with lyrics and bouncing snowflake. An absurd 1.8bn views. Taylor Swift covered Let It Go on tour, as did Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, another Frozen dad. Every night on Broadway, before curtain-up on Frozen The Musical (which opened in 2018), audiences have to be patiently reminded not to hum along. The karaoke company Lucky Voice said that Let It Go was its most-sung track of 2015. And 2016. And 2017. The song has become a gay anthem; Elsa, in turn, has been taken up as a (possibly) gay icon. You suspect this rather caught Disney off-guard, the studio having been timorous, to say the least, about representing a diverse sexuality in its family movies. In the summer of 2016, an online campaign began, calling on Disney to #GiveElsaAGirlfriend in any future sequel. The studio had been praised, in 2013, for letting a princess off their conveyor belt without an attached boyfriend. Clearly there was an opportunity to break new ground in 2019, with Frozen II, and a small hint seemed to be dropped when Disney publicised a still from the sequel during Pride month, showing Elsa in a purple dress. Accustomed to using Frozen as a launchpad for all sorts of parent-child discussions, I pencilled in an opportunity for another landmark chat with my daughter. So, I asked co-directors Buck and Lee, what was the plan? How had they responded to Elsa becoming a gay icon? There was a pause. \u201cWell, y\u2019know,\u201d Buck began \u2013 and I sensed a careful workshopped answer coming. \u201cFor Elsa, it\u2019s all about the importance of family and, y\u2019know, the strength of that. And we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re staying in that lane.\u201d He meant, in the sequel, Elsa would #NotBeGettingAGirlfriend. Lee cut in: \u201cBut what we love is that people see themselves in her, [especially] anyone who feels that they have a part of themselves that needs release.\u201d Who knows? Future instalments of the franchise might go to braver places. There have been plans to keep taking the story further. When I spoke to Menzel, she had just been on a night out with her co-star Jonathan Groff, the voice of mountain-man Kristoff. Groff had described the first movie as a seed and the second movie as a sprout. Something like that. Menzel couldn\u2019t quite remember. She paused our conversation and took out her phone. \u201cI\u2019m gonna text him right now. Hold on there. I\u2019m texting Kristoff while we speak.\u201d After many journeys on the fixed rails of Frozen\u2019s plot, there was something so thrillingly off-book about a text pinging between Elsa and Kristoff that I could hardly sit still. I wondered what my daughter would make of it. Menzel chuckled. \u201cTell your daughter \u2018Hi\u2019 from me. Tell her some old lady with dark brown hair says \u2018Hi\u2019. That\u2019ll freak her out.\u201d I said I would. *** The Lopezes have a story about how they were once in a Disney store before Christmas, queueing to buy Frozen toys with everybody else. Their songs were playing on an endless loop out of a speaker and when the Lopezes got to the front of the queue, hoping to curry favour with the server and perhaps get some sort of discount, they mentioned they\u2019d written Let It Go. The server looked at them, as the songs played and played, and asked: \u201cWhy?\u201d Robert told me: \u201cAt first our friends and neighbours used to say, \u2018Thank you for writing these songs, you\u2019ve brought our family together.\u2019 And then\u2026\u201d He laughed. \u201cAnd then it started to shift.\u201d His wife, Kristen, referred to something she called \u201cmini-van fatigue\u201d: too many road journeys, too many restarts of the CD. When I asked Lee about the most common parental response to her movie now, she answered drily: \u201cFrozen has cost me a lot of money.\u201d Rising levels of parental ennui present a challenge, as these film-makers prepare to release their sequel. \u201cWe had to start with a question,\u201d Kristen said. \u201cWhy do Frozen II at all?\u201d When she said this, an answer sprang to my mind, and it ended with nine zeros. But the Lopezes said they were most intrigued by the challenge of ageing a group of obsessed-over characters. Lee told me that, before writing the script, she plunged into books about Elizabeth I\u2019s reign, seeking ideas about where to take Elsa next. She was looking over the heads of the kids who might have come and gone as Frozen fans, eyeballing the next generation. \u201cBefore the first Frozen, I asked myself: what did I wish had been there for me as a child? And it was a heroine who was not perfect, who struggled, who wasn\u2019t good or evil, and wasn\u2019t pitted against other women. Same with Frozen II. I sat down and thought, what would have helped?\u201d Lopez mentioned geopolitics in this context. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been through crises in the last few years,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an anxiety level we all share. We wanted to show how our characters would deal with that, too.\u201d I wasn\u2019t able to see the sequel but \u2013 just a guess \u2013 look out for set-piece songs in which Elsa refreezes the melting icecaps. Anna votes Elizabeth Warren. Olaf gets Brexit done. Or maybe not. Disney will not want too many risks taken with its golden franchise. In spring this year, the company announced that Frozen The Musical would open around the world, in Sydney, Hamburg and London. Meanwhile building work was under way on a Frozen realm at Disneyland Paris, a deal that elicited an excited tweet from President Macron. Plans were announced to sell Frozen coding kits. A Frozen quad bike. Back on Broadway, they sold their millionth ticket. I went along, ducking in to see the musical during a work trip. While a real-life Elsa roamed the stage, her ice powers simulated with flashing lights and dry ice, I did my best to watch it through my daughter\u2019s eyes. I wanted to remember all the tiny details, to ferry them back to her in London. I could hardly wait. She had just turned six. We\u2019d been Frozen nuts, together, for more than half her life. I used to think that, because of her, I had seen Frozen more times than any other movie. More recently I\u2019d begun to wonder if I\u2019d seen Frozen more times than all other movies put together. There was no longer a question of irritation or fatigue: Frozen was simply a fact of parenting life, same as getting up early, having a sore back, worrying. It was while I was away in New York that my daughter was taken to see Matilda in London. Her first West End show! This came after a summer of fascination with the Women\u2019s World Cup, reading The Worst Witch books and liking Wonder Woman. When I got home, she listened politely to my stories about Frozen The Musical, then went back to recreating the big number from Matilda, the one about kids who are desperate to get on and grow up. One day she came to find me, with the air of someone who\u2019d been sitting on a big confession for a while. Deep breath. She admitted she\u2019d started to find Frozen boring. Babyish. She would come and see the sequel with me (a concession to my feelings). But the fact was she had other favourites. We hugged. I thought of the time she first teetered away, walking, or spent a whole morning at nursery by herself \u2013 fantastic new beginnings that also marked, unequivocally, an end. I needed to vent some of this to wiser ears. Who better than the songwriting Lopezes, emotionally nimble enough to stuff one single film with the biggest pop song of the decade (Let It Go), a masterpiece of musical storytelling (For The First Time In Forever) and a sneaky joke about bestiality? I explained that my daughter had pushed through the other side, gone post-Frozen. Was it weird that I felt so distraught? \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable,\u201d Kristen said. \u201cWe had the same. Our daughters were so in love with the first movie. Then they grew up. They got obsessed with Hamilton. Our eldest is 14 now and into Billie Eilish and YouTube ukulele stars.\u201d They tried to write some of these anxieties into songs for the sequel, Robert said. \u201cAbout growing. Going into the unknown. Facing some of the fears we all have around change.\u201d The family had just that week been to a screening of Frozen II, Kristen said. It turned out that even the 14-year-old Billie Eilish fan could get back into Anna and Elsa for a night. \u201cWe talked about it the whole car ride home,\u201d Kristen said. \u201cThey\u2019re kind, sweet girls. But, yeah, they\u2019re on their own paths now. And the fact that we got 45 minutes of their warmth, again, that was\u2026 That was a very nice thing.\u201d \u2022 Frozen II is out on 22 November.

      "body": "<h2><strong>When did you start working at the Guardian? </strong></h2> <p>It was October 1988 \u2013 just over 31 years ago! I was hired to cover business, with a special responsibility for property. Canary Wharf was being built and the UK was in the middle of a house price boom. I remember my first day clearly. I reported on British Gas, with a deadline of about 5pm. Back then it was only a newspaper, so there was no huge rush to file copy like there is today.</p> <h2><strong>Have you always been interested in this area?</strong></h2> <p>A few years previously, I had graduated with a degree from Cambridge in history, having originally been accepted to study economics and switched courses because there was too much maths for my liking. I was deeply interested in the economy, but mostly from a historical perspective. After graduating, I worked at the Press Association as their economics correspondent and enjoyed some time as a cub reporter before my big break at the Guardian.</p> <h2><strong>What are your biggest professional highlights so far? </strong></h2> <p>It feels slightly ghoulish to say so, but the most memorable moments have often been in the middle of times of despair. The stock market crash of 1987, Black Wednesday in 1992, and the Financial Crisis of 2007-09 particularly stick in my mind. For an economics reporter, these are frenetic, exciting and often highly satisfying periods. There\u2019s a lot to discuss and our readers often appreciate having complicated things made more explicable and less jargon-y \u2013 though many are specialists themselves, or at least highly interested and self-taught amateurs.</p> <h2>What are the biggest challenges of the role?</h2> <p>When the economy is doing well, it can be very challenging. The period from the 90s to the early 00s was dubbed the \u201cnice decade\u201d by Mervyn King, the then governor of the Bank of England. There was falling unemployment, interest rates were low, the economy was downgraded as a news story, New Labour had come to power. There was some debate over the euro, but otherwise it was fairly steady and not much to write about.</p> <h2><strong>Looking at the period between the financial crisis and the Brexit referendum, what </strong><strong>have been the most </strong><strong> significant moments?</strong></h2> <p>I think the moment when we knew the banks were going to be bailed out was hugely significant. It signified that those responsible were getting away with it. I knew that this was a financial crisis that had been caused by the financial sector, and I believe it contributed<strong> </strong>to the 2016 referendum result because the eurozone almost broke apart following crises in Greece, Ireland and Portugal brought about by the crash. Europe felt flawed and in need of fundamental change. Since 2016, we haven\u2019t recognised the importance of that period on the result \u2013 the impact of austerity on those parts of Britain that feel left-behind \u2013 and we\u2019ve had three wasted years when no one has really got to grips with the reasons we voted as we did.</p> <p>Politics dominates economics, and it can be quite depressing when you see the same mistakes being repeated time and time again by the financially powerful. You can often pre-empt what\u2019s going to happen because things happen in waves. People forget what\u2019s come before, and then the same mistakes are made again, sometimes by the same people. It\u2019s happening as we speak, because all the signs point to another financial bubble out there that will leave policymakers scrabbling around for a response when \u2013 not if \u2013 it pops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26b0f5e23053dd5f425774a27b5c0830ab049acb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26b0f5e23053dd5f425774a27b5c0830ab049acb/0_0_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lehman Brothers sign on wall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in the depths of the financial crisis in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: New York Daily News Archive/NY Daily News via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>You\u2019ve previously spoken about how in 2007</strong><strong> you came up with the </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/audio/2019/apr/23/how-the-green-new-deal-was-hatched-in-a-london-bar-podcast\">concept of the Green New Deal</a>. Can you tell us more about that?</strong></h2> <p>I am very proud of the Green New Deal. It had modest beginnings in a bar in London. I was with Colin Hines of Greenpeace. We met during the financial crisis and were reflecting on what had happened in the deep recession that followed the Wall Street Crash in 1929, wondering what was to come. We needed a response from a progressive left, and felt that this was a chance to seize the agenda. The plan was to increase public spending, drive recovery, tax finance<strong> </strong>more heavily, get people back to work, retrofit homes with better insulation and introduce low carbon energy. There has been much more recognition of the green agenda, and climate is now a much bigger part of it. But nothing really happened back then. Everyone is talking about the green agenda again now, and people such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> are focusing attention, but it feels like there have been 10 wasted years.</p> <h2><strong>In terms of tackling the climate crisis, what could we learn from the financial crisis?</strong></h2> <p>Sometimes it takes more than one crisis for fundamental change to happen. That was certainly the case in the 1970s when it was the second energy shock that led to the decisive shift to the right. This time could be the same.<strong> </strong>The financial crisis hasn\u2019t yet blown over and we could be on the cusp of another after year after year of virtually zero interest rates. And in terms of energy, climate and the financial crunch, we are worse off than a decade ago.</p> <p>When we first formulated the Green New Deal, the plan was to introduce jobs in every constituency, to reskill and retrain, invest in local communities. We wanted to use universities as centres of excellence for green technology. All of this is still yet to happen because of lack of buy-in from those in charge. </p> <h2><strong>How does this view differ between the UK and the US</strong><strong> at the moment?</strong></h2> <p>Both countries are encountering similar issues around the economy, in particular the sense among many people that globalisation works for the better off but not for them. </p> <p>Periods of stability and peace don\u2019t last forever. There is nearly always something bad waiting around the corner. For the last 40 years, the western economy has been run on a free-market, trickle-down basis \u2013 there is surely enough evidence to see that that doesn\u2019t work. We should have learned lessons from the financial crash, but we didn\u2019t. In 2016 we had our second opportunity, and we missed that too. Now, the climate emergency means we\u2019re playing with fire. Power structures have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, making change difficult. Global heating makes it vital that we work towards progressive change \u2013 even more vital than in the 1930s, in fact. </p> <h2><strong>You anticipated the </strong><strong>crisis in the EU. </strong><strong>Do you still feel there\u2019s hope for a healthy and prosperous future for the UK and Europe?</strong></h2> <p>I think the worst thing that can happen is that the current state of purgatory continues. It\u2019s difficult to address the problems. I think that if and when we leave, it won\u2019t be as bad as people think. I believe we will find a way of surviving and indeed thriving.

I think my views are valued by readers, or at least some of them! To me, 2016 was an expression of profound dissatisfaction with the status quo, of which the EU is part. </p> <p>I\u2019ve always thought Tony Benn got it right about the EU. He thought of it as pro big business, pro multinationals, anti working people, undemocratic and the embodiment of neoliberal economic ideas. I agree with that. I\u2019m not sure, though, that the economic arguments matter all that much in the current Brexit debate. It is more about how people feel about themselves, how they identify themselves. For those on the Remain side, opposing Brexit suggests that they are liberal, internationalist, supporters of modernity and multiculturalism. I see no contradiction in being pro-Brexit and being an internationalist. I have never seen anything especially leftwing about the EU. </p> <p>Fortunately, our editor in chief, Katharine Viner, welcomes a plurality of views in the paper.

I don\u2019t think I could have survived as economics editor of a different paper, for this reason.</p> <h2><strong>What makes the Guardian unique?</strong></h2> <p>News and comment are completely separate at the Guardian, which is useful in introducing multiple voices and making us a truly broad church. </p> <p>I\u2019ve always wanted to work at the Guardian and never been tempted to go elsewhere \u2013 other places just seemed second best. I have complete freedom here: not once has an editor tapped me on my shoulder and told me to toe the party line. Being a journalist is such a privilege \u2013 you never know what\u2019s going to happen on any given day, and that makes it endlessly exciting. The Guardian isn\u2019t perfect, of course, but we do our best to be truthful and honest.</p>",

Being a journalist is such a privilege \u2013 you never know what\u2019s going to happen on any given day, and that makes it endlessly exciting. The Guardian isn\u2019t perfect, of course, but we do our best to be truthful and honest.",

To them the logic must seem simple and straightforward: they want to eject a cruel and useless government and stop Brexit, and that means denying Boris Johnson a majority and replacing him with Jeremy Corbyn, who will end austerity and hold a second referendum. Job done.</p> <p>I wish it were as simple as that for me. But it\u2019s not.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For more than four years, Britain\u2019s Jews have waited for the moment when one of these revelations would prove too much</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because while I want desperately to avoid Brexit, and while I have nothing but contempt for Johnson and his hard-right party, the prospect of Prime Minister Corbyn fills me with dread. Not, I stress, the prospect of a Labour government, committed to spending billions on schools, hospitals and houses \u2013 Britain needs that badly \u2013 but specifically the notion of Corbyn and his inner circle running the country. The thought of it prompts in me, and the overwhelming majority of the community I grew up in, a fear that we have not known before.</p> <p>I\u2019m referring to Britain\u2019s Jews who, for the first time in their history, have concluded that someone hostile to them is on the brink of taking democratic power. Yes, of course, not every single British Jew holds that view. But <a href=\"https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/election-poll-2019-survation-jn/\" title=\"\">the most recent </a><a href=\"https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/election-poll-2019-survation-jn/\" title=\"\">poll</a> found that 87% regard Corbyn as an antisemite, meaning an anti-Jewish racist.</p> <p>Why? The recitation is now wearily familiar. Recall that Corbyn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/23/corbyn-criticised-after-backing-artist-behind-antisemitic-mural\" title=\"\">first reaction</a> on hearing of a plan to remove a mural filled with hideous caricatures of hook-nosed Jewish bankers was to ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d Or that he <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/corbyn-defends-saying-zionists-dont-understand-english-culture/\" title=\"\">decided to challenge</a> two \u201cZionists\u201d not on their arguments but by suggesting that, though they \u201cmight have lived in this country for a very long time\u201d, they \u201cdon\u2019t understand English irony\u201d. Or that, when a Palestinian Islamist preacher was <a href=\"https://hurryupharry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Salah-ruling.pdf\" title=\"\">found by a British </a><a href=\"https://hurryupharry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Salah-ruling.pdf\" title=\"\">tribunal</a> to have peddled the medieval and lethal myth of Jews feasting on the blood of gentile children, Corbyn declared that man a very \u201c<a href=\"https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/salah-corbyn/\" title=\"\">honoured citizen</a>\u201d, and invited him for tea in the House of Commons. (And those are merely some of the greatest hits; the full discography runs much longer.)</p> <p>For four years, Britain\u2019s Jews have \u2013 naively, perhaps \u2013 waited for the moment when one of these revelations would prove too much for the Labour faithful, shocking them into action. Perhaps it would be the discovery that, despite evidence against hundreds of party members \u2013 including those trafficking in grotesque neo-Nazi imagery and Holocaust denial \u2013 only a handful have actually been expelled. Or maybe it would be the BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0006p8c\" title=\"\">Panorama investigation</a> that showed how Corbyn\u2019s team repeatedly interfered in antisemitism cases as they went through a supposedly independent disciplinary process, \u201cmainly so they could let their mates off the charge\u201d, as one whistleblower, driven to the brink of suicide, <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/jeremy-corbyn-has-done-more-to-inflame-antisemitism-than-any-political-figure-since-second-world-war-1.486310\" title=\"\">put it</a>. Or perhaps it would be the fact that Labour has become only the second political party ever to be investigated for institutional racism by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (the other was the BNP).</p> <p>But no. No revelation has ever proved shocking enough that it couldn\u2019t be explained away by those who\u2019d rather not see it. So publicly Labour\u2019s luminaries insist they are fighting a \u201cruthless\u201d fight against antisemitism, doing all the Jewish community has asked of them, as John McDonnell said this week, even though the facts point the other way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/08/gideon-bull-labour-candidate-pulls-out-of-election-over-shylock-remarks\">Labour candidate pulls out of election over 'Shylock' remarks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019re meant to cheer that Chris Williamson has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/labour-nec-drops-chris-williamson-antisemitism-row-mp-as-election-candidate\" title=\"\">been barred</a> from standing again as an MP. But Jews remember that, even when Williamson\u2019s penchant for egregious Jew-baiting was well known, Corbyn was still praising him.

He\u2019s a very strong anti-racist campaigner. He is not antisemitic in any way.\u201d </p> <p>None of this has stopped. Labour\u2019s crop of prospective parliamentary candidates has included several with a documented history of anti-Jewish bigotry, Twitter back-catalogues playing on all the familiar tunes of Jewish conspiracy, greed and the rest of it. Two candidates were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/labour-candidate-kate-ramsden-steps-down-israel-comparison\" title=\"\">forced to step down</a> on Thursday, one for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/08/gideon-bull-labour-candidate-pulls-out-of-election-over-shylock-remarks\" title=\"\">calling a Jewish fellow councillor \u201cShylock\u201d</a>.

      "bodyText": "For most progressive-minded, remain-leaning folk, is it even a dilemma? I\u2019m not sure. To them the logic must seem simple and straightforward: they want to eject a cruel and useless government and stop Brexit, and that means denying Boris Johnson a majority and replacing him with Jeremy Corbyn, who will end austerity and hold a second referendum. Job done. I wish it were as simple as that for me. But it\u2019s not. Because while I want desperately to avoid Brexit, and while I have nothing but contempt for Johnson and his hard-right party, the prospect of Prime Minister Corbyn fills me with dread. Not, I stress, the prospect of a Labour government, committed to spending billions on schools, hospitals and houses \u2013 Britain needs that badly \u2013 but specifically the notion of Corbyn and his inner circle running the country. The thought of it prompts in me, and the overwhelming majority of the community I grew up in, a fear that we have not known before. I\u2019m referring to Britain\u2019s Jews who, for the first time in their history, have concluded that someone hostile to them is on the brink of taking democratic power. Yes, of course, not every single British Jew holds that view. But the most recent poll found that 87% regard Corbyn as an antisemite, meaning an anti-Jewish racist. Why? The recitation is now wearily familiar. Recall that Corbyn\u2019s first reaction on hearing of a plan to remove a mural filled with hideous caricatures of hook-nosed Jewish bankers was to ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d Or that he decided to challenge two \u201cZionists\u201d not on their arguments but by suggesting that, though they \u201cmight have lived in this country for a very long time\u201d, they \u201cdon\u2019t understand English irony\u201d. Or that, when a Palestinian Islamist preacher was found by a British tribunal to have peddled the medieval and lethal myth of Jews feasting on the blood of gentile children, Corbyn declared that man a very \u201chonoured citizen\u201d, and invited him for tea in the House of Commons. (And those are merely some of the greatest hits; the full discography runs much longer.) For four years, Britain\u2019s Jews have \u2013 naively, perhaps \u2013 waited for the moment when one of these revelations would prove too much for the Labour faithful, shocking them into action. Perhaps it would be the discovery that, despite evidence against hundreds of party members \u2013 including those trafficking in grotesque neo-Nazi imagery and Holocaust denial \u2013 only a handful have actually been expelled. Or maybe it would be the BBC Panorama investigation that showed how Corbyn\u2019s team repeatedly interfered in antisemitism cases as they went through a supposedly independent disciplinary process, \u201cmainly so they could let their mates off the charge\u201d, as one whistleblower, driven to the brink of suicide, put it. Or perhaps it would be the fact that Labour has become only the second political party ever to be investigated for institutional racism by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (the other was the BNP). But no. No revelation has ever proved shocking enough that it couldn\u2019t be explained away by those who\u2019d rather not see it. So publicly Labour\u2019s luminaries insist they are fighting a \u201cruthless\u201d fight against antisemitism, doing all the Jewish community has asked of them, as John McDonnell said this week, even though the facts point the other way. We\u2019re meant to cheer that Chris Williamson has been barred from standing again as an MP. But Jews remember that, even when Williamson\u2019s penchant for egregious Jew-baiting was well known, Corbyn was still praising him. Just a few months ago, in fact, Corbyn called him \u201ca very good, very effective Labour MP. He\u2019s a very strong anti-racist campaigner. He is not antisemitic in any way.\u201d None of this has stopped. Labour\u2019s crop of prospective parliamentary candidates has included several with a documented history of anti-Jewish bigotry, Twitter back-catalogues playing on all the familiar tunes of Jewish conspiracy, greed and the rest of it. Two candidates were forced to step down on Thursday, one for calling a Jewish fellow councillor \u201cShylock\u201d. It suggests this is no longer a problem of one man, but that the malaise is now institutional. And yet Labour\u2019s high command could soon be governing the country. Labour doesn\u2019t even need to win many seats; Johnson needs only to fail to win a majority and Corbyn will be closing in on Downing Street. What should Jewish voters and those appalled by anti-Jewish racism do about that? Plenty advise Jews to shelve their angst in return for a government that will stop Brexit (Jews are overwhelmingly pro-remain). In effect, Jews and their would-be allies are being told that some racism is, if not quite acceptable, then a price worth paying.

As with vinyl\u2019s comeback, however, music fans seem eager to embrace the quirks of physical formats, in this case such as winding tapes by hand with a pen and turning it over at the end of each side. Some websites also mention the hiss of the tape as an appealing feature. Emanuel said cassettes were attractive to bands starting out because they were cheaper than CDs and could be produced in smaller production runs than vinyl. HMV\u2019s head of music, John Hirst, said that any artist with a fanbase was producing a cassette these days. Both artists and record labels have added tapes to album bundles that include a CD, vinyl and T-shirt in a bid to boost sales. \u201cThe thing about cassettes is they are being bought as a collectible merchandise rather than to listen to,\u201d said Hirst. \u201cWe don\u2019t sell many cassettes over the counter. The sales are coming from artists\u2019 websites.\u201d Because tapes were cheap to manufacture, small indie labels were also releasing music on cassette to a customer base that actually listens to them, he said, but sales were small. The spike in tape sales coincides with the 40th anniversary of the first Walkman, which Sony has marked with a limited edition music player, albeit not one that plays tapes. Retailers including Tesco, Argos and Urban Outfitters have spied the opportunity though, and are selling budget portable cassette players and boomboxes starting at around \u00a315. Another British company GPO Retro, which makes items ranging from record players to phones, developed an 80s-inspired \u201cBrooklyn boombox\u201d that looks not unlike the one John Cusack holds aloft at the end of cult 80s film Say Anything, after noting strong sales of its shoebox-style tape recorder. GPO\u2019s managing director, Gary Basso said: \u201cNostalgia has always been a trend and it always will be. People love seeing something that was an iconic part of their past brought up to date. We are seeing big sales coming out of the Brooklyn. In the UK it has gone really crazy. \u201cWe have probably sold around 17,000 units in the past year that incorporated a cassette player, which is about three times as much as the previous year. The people buying them are aged anywhere between 25 and over 60.\u201d The hit film Guardians of the Galaxy is credited with starting the tape renaissance after clever marketers released the soundtrack on a tape that looked like the one that features heavily in the film.

      "body": "<p>In September, Michael Goulding visited his parents-in-law in Birmingham, who live in a modest semi-detached house. They are pensioners, both in their 90s, and asked Michael to take a look at their home insurance, which was worrying them. They had received a bill for the coming year which had gone up by 20% and, on their relatively low income, wondered how they were going to pay. It was for \u00a3579.08, compared to \u00a3482.56 the year before.</p> <p>Luckily, they had Michael to help and he went online. He managed to find similar insurance for just \u00a3108 \u2026 and, of course, the quote was from Halifax, for exactly the same property.</p> <p>Regular readers will know there is nothing new about this. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/16/home-insurance-swindle-loyal-customers-premium-rises\" title=\"\">I\u2019ve highlighted the extraordinary gap</a> between prices charged to new and existing customers for years \u2013 but it just keeps getting worse.</p> <p>Home insurance companies (the big three are Direct Line, Aviva and Halifax) are addicted to the fat profits they extract from these vulnerable customers so they can offer cheap deals to new customers. And they just can\u2019t find a way to wean themselves off it.</p> <p>Some of the excuses are preposterous. When Goulding rang Halifax, he says he was told that the increased premium was because of a rise in crime in the area. I had a look at the postcode on the police.uk website. It showed that there was, indeed, a 20% change in the number of burglaries in the past six months compared to a year earlier. They were <em>down</em> by 20%.</p> <p>Now let\u2019s be kind and assume the agent went off-script, and was giving a \u201cmaybe\u201d reason.</p> <p>Instead, let\u2019s look at Halifax\u2019s official explanation, and the 436% more it expected this couple to pay compared to new customers.</p> <p>When I asked, it said: \u201cThe new policy (ie, the \u00a3108 found online) did not include cover for accidental damage.\u201d So I went through the Halifax quote engine for my own home. The quote came back at \u00a3160. If I added accidental damage cover, it went up to \u00a3169. So that explains \u00a39 of the \u00a3471 overcharge.</p> <p>So, Halifax, what else could explain the huge gap? Well, the new policy had a different excess, it said. So I checked that, too. Adjusting the excess down to \u00a3100 from \u00a3250 added another \u00a311 a year. So, no, that doesn\u2019t explain the gap, either.</p> <p>The truth is that everyone in the home insurance business knows this market is dysfunctional. Privately, the top names in the business will tell you they agree it\u2019s plain wrong to charge older customers not using the internet five times the rate charged to new customers.</p> <p>But they throw their hands up in the air about the price comparison sites, which drive nearly all new business. Unless they offer loss-leading prices, they say, and screw the back-book of \u201cloyal\u201d customers, they may as well shut up shop.</p> <p>When Ross McEwan arrived from New Zealand to take over Royal Bank of Scotland, he was staggered by the scale of differential pricing. But, even as head of a huge bank, he was unable to make headway.</p> <p>One recent reform by the Financial Conduct Authority is the requirement to prominently show last year\u2019s premium. And to be fair, Mr Goulding would not be getting a better deal for his parents-in-law were it not for that reform, as it prompted them to ask for his help.</p> <p>But the FCA knows that\u2019s not enough. It is currently <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/market-studies/ms18-1-2-interim-report.pdf\" title=\"\">examining some radical proposals,</a> with new rules expected early next year.</p> <p>One horrifies some in the industry, as it would force them to put customers on to the cheapest equivalent deal when they come to renew. But I can see no other way to break the wretched cycle this industry has got into.</p> <p>Just the other week Lloyds Banking Group, owner of Halifax, was sighing with relief that the vast compensation paid out on mis-sold PPI had finally come to an end.</p> <p>They shouldn\u2019t count their blessings too soon. Home insurance is not like PPI, as it does have a real value. But what about redress for all those elderly customers sold into policies that have been so outrageously over-priced?</p> <p><em>p.collinson@theguardian.com</em></p>",

They are pensioners, both in their 90s, and asked Michael to take a look at their home insurance, which was worrying them. They had received a bill for the coming year which had gone up by 20% and, on their relatively low income, wondered how they were going to pay. It was for \u00a3579.08, compared to \u00a3482.56 the year before. Luckily, they had Michael to help and he went online. He managed to find similar insurance for just \u00a3108 \u2026 and, of course, the quote was from Halifax, for exactly the same property. Regular readers will know there is nothing new about this. I\u2019ve highlighted the extraordinary gap between prices charged to new and existing customers for years \u2013 but it just keeps getting worse. Home insurance companies (the big three are Direct Line, Aviva and Halifax) are addicted to the fat profits they extract from these vulnerable customers so they can offer cheap deals to new customers. And they just can\u2019t find a way to wean themselves off it. Some of the excuses are preposterous. When Goulding rang Halifax, he says he was told that the increased premium was because of a rise in crime in the area. I had a look at the postcode on the police.uk website. It showed that there was, indeed, a 20% change in the number of burglaries in the past six months compared to a year earlier. They were down by 20%. Now let\u2019s be kind and assume the agent went off-script, and was giving a \u201cmaybe\u201d reason. Instead, let\u2019s look at Halifax\u2019s official explanation, and the 436% more it expected this couple to pay compared to new customers. When I asked, it said: \u201cThe new policy (ie, the \u00a3108 found online) did not include cover for accidental damage.\u201d So I went through the Halifax quote engine for my own home. The quote came back at \u00a3160. If I added accidental damage cover, it went up to \u00a3169. So that explains \u00a39 of the \u00a3471 overcharge. So, Halifax, what else could explain the huge gap? Well, the new policy had a different excess, it said. So I checked that, too. Adjusting the excess down to \u00a3100 from \u00a3250 added another \u00a311 a year. So, no, that doesn\u2019t explain the gap, either. The truth is that everyone in the home insurance business knows this market is dysfunctional. Privately, the top names in the business will tell you they agree it\u2019s plain wrong to charge older customers not using the internet five times the rate charged to new customers. But they throw their hands up in the air about the price comparison sites, which drive nearly all new business. Unless they offer loss-leading prices, they say, and screw the back-book of \u201cloyal\u201d customers, they may as well shut up shop. When Ross McEwan arrived from New Zealand to take over Royal Bank of Scotland, he was staggered by the scale of differential pricing. But, even as head of a huge bank, he was unable to make headway. One recent reform by the Financial Conduct Authority is the requirement to prominently show last year\u2019s premium. And to be fair, Mr Goulding would not be getting a better deal for his parents-in-law were it not for that reform, as it prompted them to ask for his help. But the FCA knows that\u2019s not enough. It is currently examining some radical proposals, with new rules expected early next year. One horrifies some in the industry, as it would force them to put customers on to the cheapest equivalent deal when they come to renew. But I can see no other way to break the wretched cycle this industry has got into. Just the other week Lloyds Banking Group, owner of Halifax, was sighing with relief that the vast compensation paid out on mis-sold PPI had finally come to an end. They shouldn\u2019t count their blessings too soon. Home insurance is not like PPI, as it does have a real value. But what about redress for all those elderly customers sold into policies that have been so outrageously over-priced? p.collinson@theguardian.com",

Over the past two decades, Fosse, a playwright, poet, essayist and children\u2019s author as well as a novelist, has won almost every award going in Norway, while his \u201cslow prose\u201d has gained him a cult following in English translation. He has been compared to Ibsen and Beckett, and his writing has elements of both the former\u2019s severity and the latter\u2019s use of insistent repetition. (Fosse\u2019s 1996 play <em>Someone Is Going to Come</em> was based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/mar/08/samuel-beckett-waiting-for-godot\" title=\"\"><em>Waiting for Godot</em></a>.)</p> <p>In 2018 Fitzcarraldo published his short-story collection <em>Scenes from a Childhood</em>. This proved to be a taster for a more ambitious project: the Septology series, of which <em>The Other Name</em> is the first instalment, is billed as a three-volume septet, featuring not a single full stop throughout. Such is his command of the rhythm of his prose, nimbly and hauntingly translated by Damion Searls, that the omission is barely noticeable, and after a while, engagingly welcome. The work simply loops and flows. The style is formal, yet with a sense of restlessness. As for plot, there is plenty.</p> <p>It is late autumn, close to Advent. Two older men, painters, live near each other on the south-west coast of Norway, one in the city of Bj\u00f8rgvin (a thinly disguised Bergen), the other in remote Dylgja overlooking the sea. Both men are called Asle. One is an alcoholic, twice married and divorced, virtually estranged from his children, living alone with his dog and struggling with a persistent deathwish. The other Asle, widowed and childless, is also solitary, outwardly more stoical. He gave up drinking years before and is a fairly recent convert to Catholicism. That this is a story of doppelgangers is obvious: at one point, when Asle the drinker nearly dies in the snow after suffering a blackout, it is the other Asle who saves him. The two share the following exchange:</p> <p><em>You\u2019re leaving? he says</em><br><em> You don\u2019t have to go he says</em><br><em> I do have to go I say</em><br><em> But you can\u2019t, we\u2019re too far out to sea, he says</em><br><em> I have to go, I say</em></p> <p>The book is marked by pairings, from its two-part structure (each beginning with an identical paragraph) to the painting sober Asle is creating, which takes the form of two lines making the diagonal cross of a saltire and is brown and purple in hue. These colours in turn echo the apparitions or memories this Asle conjures up of himself and his wife Ales (even their names are interchangeable) as young lovers, one moment playful, the next intensely serious; his brown leather shoulder bag, her purple clothing. Sober Asle\u2019s neighbour in the countryside is \u00c5sleik, companionless farmer and fisherman, with whom he has a passive-aggressive relationship (there are echoes of <em>Godot</em>\u2019s Vladimir and Estragon here), exchanging paintings for a freezer full of lamb and smoked fish. The paintings are a gift for \u00c5sleik\u2019s sister Guro, who may or may not be the same Guro with whom both Asles have had some sort of intimacy in the past. Then there is Alida, a sister who is mentioned almost incidentally early on as having \u201cdied too young\u201d and later appears in a stunningly rendered, unsentimental memory sequence from the siblings\u2019 childhood. The doubleness is both a challenge and a reflection: \u201cI just sit and stare into the empty nothingness and probably in a way I\u2019m the empty nothingness I\u2019m looking at.\u201d</p> <p>The version of Asle who has found God (which he gently insists is \u201cknowledge\u201d not \u201cbelief\u201d) provides some of the book\u2019s most ecstatic, probing scenes. In one passage Christ\u2019s nativity is alluded to almost in passing; a well-worn story, yet one which Fosse somehow makes refreshingly original. Similarly, his descriptions of young Asle\u2019s growing awareness of colour and its endless variations prefigure Asle the mature artist. The overall theme of a \u201cshining darkness\u201d, referring to Asle\u2019s painting, his losses and his faith, is used to illuminate the fugue state of being. Fosse\u2019s fusing of the commonplace and the existential, together with his dramatic forays into the past, make for a relentlessly consuming work: already Septology feels momentous.</p> <p>\u2022<em> The Other Name Septology I-II</em>, translated by Damion Searls,<em> </em>is published by Fitzcarraldo (\u00a312.99).

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll be closing this blog and returning tomorrow. Here\u2019s where things stand at 6pm AEST. Two people have died in the Kangawalla fire near Glen Innes. The ABC has identified one of the victims as Vivian Chaplain, 69, who relatives say died trying to defend her home. The other victim is yet to be identified. Seven people are still unaccounted for and there are fears the death toll will rise as emergency services are able to access impacted areas. At least 150 homes have been destroyed and there are concerns that schools, bridges and other infrastructure may have also been damaged or lost. More than 1,300 people have fled their homes and are taking shelter in evacuation centres, according to the Red Cross. There are more than 80 fires burning with about half of those uncontained. At 6pm there were five emergency warnings still in place in NSW. Fires have also flared up in Western Australia today, with an emergency warning issued, and then downgraded, for a fire in the northern area of Gnangara in Perth\u2019s north. Prime minister Scott Morrison would not comment on Saturday whether he believed climate change had contributed to Australia\u2019s unprecedented early-season fires, saying \u201cmy only thoughts today are with those who have lost their lives and their families, the firefighters who are fighting the fires [and] the response effort that has to be delivered.\u201d Conditions are expected to ease on Sunday but worsen again on Tuesday, when the NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner has warned hot and windy weather will create extreme fire danger again, for an even larger swathe of the state. Thanks for following our coverage today. Some relatively good news: the bushfire burning in Perth\u2019s north has been brought under control, though not contained, amid warnings to residents that their lives and homes were at risk. An emergency warning was issued for people in the northern area of Gnangara about 12.50pm for a blaze which began on Sydney Road. The fire was downgraded to a \u201cwatch and act\u201d warning level less than an hour later for the suburb\u2019s south, meaning residents still need to leave or prepare to actively defend their homes. The state\u2019s Department of Fire and Emergency Services says the fire is moving in a southeasterly direction and is controlled but not contained. It warned residents that burning embers are likely to be blown around their homes, heightening the risk of new fires amid changing winds. A watch and act alert had also been issued for northern parts of Gidgegannup, northeast of Perth, but was downgraded to an advice within an hour as the fire was extinguished. The NSW premier has appointed a recovery coordinator to oversee the state\u2019s response to the bushfire emergency. Euan Ferguson, who previously led the Victorian Country Fire Authority and South Australian Country Fire Service, will coordinate recovery efforts. \u201cIt is already clear there has been extensive damage across vast areas and it is appropriate to appoint Mr Ferguson now to familiarise himself with the impacts as they develop,\u201d Gladys Berejiklian said in a statement. NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons also warned people should brace themselves for a repeat of the extreme conditions that led to these bushfires on Tuesday, when hot and windy weather will return. And it will affect an even greater swathe of the state, including the greater Sydney region. \u201cWe are expecting widespread, severe, extreme fire danger ratings,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, yesterday\u2019s fire danger was concentrated to the north-eastern quadrant of NSW. Unfortunately, come Tuesday, we will see severe and extreme by dangers not just in north-eastern NSW, right down through the greater Sydney environment, across the ranges, into the centre west, down through the Illawarra and the South Coast regions. \u201cSo we\u2019re talking about a much, much greater area of exposure to severe and extreme fire danger ratings as we head into next Tuesday. \u201cGiven the amount of fire that we already have burning, it will be difficult enough, let alone anything new that might pop up between now and then or, indeed, Tuesday itself.\u201d The NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons says the number of homes lost is now thought to be \u201cat least 150\u201d and there are five fires currently burning in NSW at emergency warning levels. He says schools, power poles, bridges and other infrastructure in the north of NSW has also been hit by the bushfires. It is not just Australia\u2019s east coast dealing with a bushfire emergency today. A bushfire has broken out in suburban Perth, as extremely hot, dry and windy conditions lash Western Australia. An emergency warning has been issued for people the northern area of Gnangara, where a fire began on Sydney Road, AAP reports. \u201cYou are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. There is a threat to lives and homes,\u201d the state\u2019s Department of Fire and Emergency Services says. A watch and act alert has also been issued for northern parts of Gidgegannup, a township 20km northeast of Perth. That means residents need to leave or prepare to actively defend their homes. More broadly, bushfire risks across WA have spiked with extremely hot, dry and windy conditions lashing the state. Authorities have warned people throughout the state to be prepared for bushfires as temperatures soar to 40C in Perth. The ABC is reporting that one of the people killed in the Glen Innes fire is 69-year-old Vivian Chaplain from Wytaliba. The ABC reports: A relative of Ms Chaplain said she died while trying to protect her home at Wytaliba, north west of Coffs Harbour on the NSW north coast. Her daughter-in-law, Chrystal Harwood, said the 69-year-old would be \u201cgreatly missed\u201d by her two children and six grandchildren. \u201cShe was a strong woman who died protecting the home and animals she loved,\u201d she said. \u201cThe loss of her has devastated our family there was nothing we could do. \u201cShe was stuck and we couldn\u2019t get to her.\u201d The Guardian is seeking to confirm this independently. Two people have died in the Kangawalla fire near Glen Innes and five other people remain unaccounted for in that area. One body was found in a burnt-out car near Diehard. Another woman, who was found in Diehard unconscious and suffering burns to 40%-50% of her body, died in a Sydney hospital. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said: \u201cSadly, we have lost two Australians and I fear that we will lose more.\u201d At least 30 people have been injured. There are more than 80 fires burning across Queensland and NSW. Three fires in NSW remain at emergency level and one fire in Queensland is at emergency level. Fire authorities say that it is unprecedented for so many fires to be burning at once \u2013 at one stage on Friday 99 fires were burning simultaneously, including 17 at emergency level \u2013 and have said that conditions will worsen again early next week. The NSW Rural Fire Services commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, warned: \u201cWe have got the worst of our fire season still ahead of us. We\u2019re not even in summer yet\u201d. Morrison avoided questions about the contribution of climate change to the fire crisis, saying his thoughts were with those who had lost loved ones and homes, but a NSW mayor, Carol Sparks, who likely lost her house in a blaze, said: \u201cWe are so impacted by drought and the lack of rain. It\u2019s climate change, there\u2019s no doubt about it. The whole of the country is going to be affected. We need to take a serious look at our future.\u201d These aerial shots give you an idea of the fires\u2019 devastation. This is the Kangawalla fire near Glen Innes that claimed two lives. Five people from the area are understood to be missing still. The mayor of Glen Innes Severn council has said her community has been \u201cdevastated\u201d by the fire that has claimed two lives and razed an unknown number of houses, and she has warned that all of Australia is at risk from dangerous climate change. Mayor Carol Sparks was evacuated as the Kangawalla fire, east of Glen Innes, burned out of control on Friday. She said her home was likely destroyed \u2013 along with those of her neighbours \u2013 \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to believe it until I see it\u201d, she said. Sparks said her thoughts were with the families of those who had died and others who are missing. The mayor said the small community of about 100 people was in shock, with five people having suffered burns. Some people stayed as the firestorm bore down, and managed to save their properties. \u201cThe worst thing is that we have lost family and friends and we are all very upset. \u201cEverybody knows each other and there are people missing that we haven\u2019t able to contact. It\u2019s very worrying.\u201d Sparks said she held no doubts global warming was increasing the number and intensity of fires across Australia. \u201cWe are so impacted by drought and the lack of rain,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s climate change, there\u2019s no doubt about it. The whole of the country is going to be affected. We need to take a serious look at our future.\u201d The prime minister, Scott Morrison, was asked on Saturday whether this year\u2019s unprecedented early-season fires were linked to climate change. \u201cMy only thoughts today are with those who have lost their lives and their families, the firefighters who are fighting the fires [and] the response effort that has to be delivered,\u201d he replied. This amazing image shows the NSW Mid North Coast from the air, taken from a flight from Sydney to Brisbane. ABC News has interviewed a Bora Ridge resident, Doug Wood, who has had a tragic night, losing his home. Wood told the ABC he walked outside his house and could smell smoke, and went and alerted his wife. They went outside and could see a plume of smoke near where his brother lived across the road. \u201cWe zoomed down the back of his place. The fire was there, but it was coming towards us so we drove back up about 2km and by the time we got up there it was into our place,\u201d he said. \u201cI live next door to my parents, we saved Mum and Dad\u2019s place and the people across the road\u2019s house, but we couldn\u2019t save ours.\u201d Wood, a former group captain in the RFS said it was probably one of the worst he\u2019d ever seen in his life. \u201cWe were on our own. There were no helicopters or anything. We just did our best. We saved mum and dad\u2019s house, so at least we have somewhere to stay.\u201d This is what fireys are facing. There is a language warning on this video (not unjustified). Posted by the crew from NSW Fire and Rescue Station 353 in Kincumber on Friday. Fighting the fire at Harrington. Extraordinary. NSW police have confirmed that at least two people have been killed by fires in the state (both died in the fire near Glen Innes). But there appears to be some confusion about how many people are missing. Earlier, authorities said seven people were missing, but more recent reports have suggested five. NSW police, however, will only say \u201ca number remain unaccounted for\u201d. Roads remain cut, and some towns hit by the fires remain inaccessible. Phone coverage is poor across much of the fire-affected areas. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services is warning residents of the Sunshine Coast that a \u201clarge fast-moving\u201d bushfire that may threaten lives is approaching homes in Cooroibah and Ringtail Creek. \u201cLeaving immediately is the safest option, as it will soon be too dangerous to drive,\u201d the QFES said in a statement. \u201cFollow your bushfire survival plan now. If you do not have a plan, your safest option is to leave immediately if it is clear to do so. If you cannot leave, identify where you will seek shelter from the bushfire. If you are not in the area, do not return, as conditions are too dangerous.\u201d The fire is expected to threaten houses and firefighters have warned that they may not be able to reach people who choose to stay. Emergency warnings are being broadcast across the region. \u201cConditions are now very dangerous and firefighters may soon be unable to prevent the fire advancing. The fire may pose a threat to all lives directly in its path. Fire crews may not be able to protect your property. You should not expect a firefighter at your door: act now. \u201cPower, water, and mobile phone service may be lost and road conditions may become very dangerous over the next several hours.\u201d There have been a few questions to the PM, including one about the ferocity of these early fires and links to climate change. \u201cMy only thoughts today are those who lost their lives and their families, the firefighters fighting the fires, the response effort that has to be delivered, and how the the Commonwealth can support those efforts,\u201d he replied. He said Australia had been \u201cbattling ferocious fires for as long as Australia has been a nation and well before,\u201d he said. He said Australians all had to brace themselves for the fire season, and he feared there would be more deaths confirmed before the day was out. \u201cWe always have to listen carefully to the warnings, and undertake the preparations that are advised in every single season. I think that Australians increasingly understand that and I would be encouraging them to revisit their fire preparation plans. The fire might be on your doorstep today, but as we go into every fire season and every summer season, the risk is ever present, and it\u2019s important that families understand what the evacuation procedures are. What numbers to call. What things to ready themselves with, and how they can best prepare their properties in the event of a firestorm. Prime minister Scott Morrison is speaking now \u2013 and he\u2019s flagged a \u201ccontingency option\u201d of further involvement of the defence forces. He said the deployment of ADF \u2013 beyond the airlifts they\u2019re already doing \u2013 hadn\u2019t been requested yet, but he and relevant ministers were discussing having them ready. \u201cI convened this morning with ministers with direct operational responsibility ... and the ADF is presenting options on callouts of reservists as may be necessary,\u201d he said. That would likely involve building fire breaks away from fire fronts, and providing accommodation and logistics to assist the state agencies working on the frontline. \u201cOur defence forces are not trained firefighters,\u201d he stressed. \u201cThe ADF can provide a lot of support in logistics and other areas as required.\u201d Morrison has thanked services responding to the emergencies, and also warned that similar conditions were expected in WA over the next few days. Three WA regions were expected to go to \u201ccatastrophic\u201d warnings, and resources would be made available. \u201cThe sad truth is we\u2019ve had far too much practice and deployments in these areas but the lessons learned ... have ensured the coordination and response is very swift.\u201d He also said emergency service payments for people affected would be mobilised over the weekend \u2013 $1,000 per adult and $400 per child. Greg Allan, spokesman for the NSW rural fire service, has given us a quick update on the resources out there fighting the 81 bush and grass fires across the state. There are more than 1,200 RFS firefighters, more than 300 vehicles, and more than 60 aircraft including two large air tankers. That\u2019s including local crews, but there are also out-of-areas crews and interstate agencies assisting, as well as NSW fire and rescue, the national parks and wildlife service, and forestry. In the north of NSW, 164 minimum security inmates were evacuated from Glenn Innes prison to Grafton, according to the department of corrections. There are stock losses and at least 10 homes as well as bridges lost in the Nambucca valley, the mayor of the shire, Rhonda Hoban, has said. The Kian road fire has gone through more than 14,000 hectares and is at a watch and act level. Hoban has asked for people living near the fireground areas to do what they need to do while they can and get out. The rest of the community to stay away from the fireground areas. She said mobile services and electricity was out for hundreds of people. At the moment in NSW there are two emergency level fires \u2013 at Hillville and Stockyard Flat \u2013 and 14 at the watch and act level. In Queensland, there is one emergency fire at Cooroibah and three watch and act. There are still dozens of fires burning across both states. That out-of-control Hillville fire, south of Taree, has gone through more than 12,300 hectares so far, and local ABC radio reported just few minutes ago that it has reached the coastline at Diamond Beach. Club Old Bar on the mid north coast has been set up as a safe neighbourhood space, as the large fire approaches the coastal town. There\u2019s about 320 people there, and organisers are expecting more. The mid north coast mayor has just told the ABC the surf club had been sheltering people but it was recently evacuated. There are about 800 firefighters and support crew from interstate and New Zealand who have come to help fight NSW\u2019s fires. We\u2019re also hearing from on the ground that new roads are being closed as fires shift direction. Monitor local broadcasters and please obey the signs. NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons reiterated that the forecast for next week \u2013 Tuesday in particular \u2013 was dire, and that the outlook for the summer beyond was potentially catastrophic. He said the long-running drought in NSW had left the state tinder-dry and dangerously flammable. Not only is it about next week, but, unfortunately, the forecast for the balance of the season continues to be driven by above-normal temperatures, below-average rainfall, to dominate over the coming months. If you put that across this extremely drought-stricken landscape, where you have no moisture in the ground ... a flammability of the fuel which is seeing extraordinary fire behaviour, fire spreading and burning very intensely, very aggressively \u2026 with spot fire activity doubling or tripling what would normally be expected in the conditions that we have been experiencing. The flammability, the lack of moisture in the vegetation, is making it so susceptible to ignition, that many embers are leading well ahead of the main fire front, taking hold, starting fires, and rapidly accelerating the movement of fire across the landscape and into different communities. The risk is real, the risk is here, the consequences are absolutely apparent and evident over the last few weeks and particularly highlighted in the last 24 hours. We have got the worst of our fire season still ahead of us. We\u2019re not even in summer yet. A very shaken mayor of the mid north council, David West, has just called in to local ABC radio. He says it\u2019s \u201cnot a good morning at all\u201d, but he is floored by the outpouring of support from people, offering homes and rooms for accommodation. \u201cI\u2019m so immensely proud of people putting their lives on the line to assist us to survive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe numbers are horrendous. We\u2019ve got over 580 people registered at Club Taree [evacuation centre], 170 at the Tuncurry bowling club, and at Old Bar 80 people are registered.\u201d He said the Telstra service was failing and 1,000 people \u2013 mostly in rural areas \u2013 were without power. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen fires like this in my life,\u201d West says. \u201cWhen I look at the fire website, and the Hillville fire, progressing to the coast and Old Bar and Diamond Beach, these are heavily populated areas, heavily timbered areas. \u201cThis state is burning.\u201d West urged people to listen to firefighters and police, and leave their homes if they\u2019d been so advised. \u201cIf they say get out, please leave. Homes can be replaced \u2026 life can\u2019t be replaced.\u201d The ferocity of yesterday\u2019s fires, and the extent of the tragedy, is only now becoming apparent. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has confirmed two people are dead as the state\u2019s bushfire emergency extends into a second day. Seven people are unaccounted for. Berejiklian warned the death toll could rise and new fire grounds were accessed this morning: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say that number could increase during the day.\u201d The first person\u2019s body found was in a burnt-out car in the Kangawalla fire, near Glen Innes. The second death was of a woman found at the same fire last night, unconscious and with burns to 40-50% of her body. Despite CPR from fire and ambulance crews and treatment in hospital, she died this morning. The deaths are not considered related. The seven people missing are also from the same fire. NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said \u201cwe could see more casualty and more loss as the details unfold\u201d. He said the RFS had received many messages from people trapped by fire but simply could not reach them. Bridges, schools, power infrastructure have all been destroyed, Fitzsimmons said. The Kangawalla fire, in which the body of a person trapped in a burnt-out car this morning, has eased. The fire remains at Watch and Act. This week, 11,000 climate scientists warned of \u2018untold suffering\u2019 as a result of the climate crisis. The prime minister: AAP reports: Thousands of people were evacuated from Noosa overnight with suburbs remaining cut off as a bushfire rages out of control. Tewantin, in Noosa\u2019s north, is cut off and there are concerns spot fires could cause more havoc as temperatures rise throughout the day. Roughly 2,000 people were evacuated from Tewantin and Noosa North Shore on Friday afternoon and into the night, independent Noosa MP Sandy Bolton said. They sought shelter at local showgrounds, sporting facilities and church outreach centres. One firefighter broke their leg and a home has been destroyed at Cooroibah. It is understood the fire started at Cooroibah before jumping the river to Teewah and creeping towards Tewantin. The Tewantin fire is one of three major fires burning in Queensland, with crews also fighting blazes at Lower Beechmont in the Gold Coast hinterland and at Thornton in the Lockyer Valley. A severe fire danger is in place for the coastal and adjacent inland areas from Gympie to Ingham, and in the northern goldfields including Charters Towers, Julia Creek and Georgetown. Authorities said 37 fires were burning across Queensland as of Saturday morning. Homes near Old Bar and Wallabi Point, right on the coast south of the Manning River (between Forster and Port Macquarie) are in imminent danger ... Terrifyingly prescient ... This is from the Kangawalla fire in northern NSW, where a person\u2019s body was found in a burnt-out car this morning. Rogers said an RFS firetruck was overrun by flames and destroyed on Friday. The firefighters inside survived, but have been taken to hospital suffering smoke inhalation. He said at least 35 people had been injured, including 16 firefighters. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole range of injuries and some are quite serious - bad smoke inhalation, heart attacks and burns.\u201d Rogers said conditions were likely to deteriorate again early next week. \u201cThe big concern is getting as much containment [work done as possible] ahead of Tuesday, where there\u2019s really bad conditions expected, potentially as bad as yesterday. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of work today in working out what was lost yesterday, making sure that anyone who is hurt is getting help.\u201d NSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said there had been reports of \u201ca significant loss of koalas\u201d in the northern NSW fires. \u201cThey\u2019re not very quick animals, they are very vulnerable. It\u2019s devastating,\u201d he told Sky News on Saturday morning. \u201cWhere you\u2019d normally have a fire and animals move out of the way, unfortunately in some cases they are moving into the path of another fire.\u201d He said in addition to native species, domestic and farm animals had likely been lost too. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be counting the cost of the fire for a while, and it\u2019s going to be a pretty high cost.\u201d There are a suite of road closures across northern NSW because of fires. The situation on fire grounds is still unpredictable so these can change quickly. Please check latest updates if you are travelling in bushfire-affected areas... This is not an exhaustive list, and these do change quickly. Check before you get on the roads... NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said at least 100 homes had been destroyed in fires, but warned \u201cwe are expecting that number to climb\u201d. We need to prepare ourselves for that number to climb potentially quite significantly because there are lots of \u2026 heavily impacted fire grounds where we simply haven\u2019t been able to get people in to undertake even an initial assessment. He said 40 fires were continuing to burn uncontained, and that fire crews were working to assess whether any people were still trapped in their homes by fire. We don\u2019t know. We are not aware of anybody being trapped. We are trying to access all the fire ground areas. Some areas yesterday, we simply could not get in. Fitzsimmons said Friday\u2019s fires were unprecedented in the sheer number of blazes requiring firefighting resources. In years gone by, you would find one, two, three fires burning at once that were commanding so much attention and doing so much of the damage. But what we saw yesterday was 99 fires burning. Seventeen of those at once were at \u2018emergency\u2019 warning level. Another nine of those were at \u2018watch and act\u2019 alert level at the same time. We had 1,300 firefighters and emergency workers trying to get in and do the very best they could. There are some more details on the death of a person in the Kangawalla fire near Glen Innes. The person\u2019s body was found in a burnt-out car this morning. Shane Fitzsimmons, commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service, told the ABC: One of our senior volunteer commanders surveying and seeking to identify unaccounted-for people has come across a burnt-out vehicle and the remains of somebody has been located inside that vehicle. Clearly, that\u2019s very distressing and our thoughts and prayers to those that are affected and particularly the family and loved ones of the occupant of this vehicle. The matter will be managed by the police and a more forensic assessment and identification process will be under taken to confirm exactly who has been located. The Kangawalla fire, where the body of one person has been found in a car, remains an ongoing threat. The size and speed of Friday\u2019s fires is evident from these satellite shots. The NSW Rural Fire Service has confirmed one person has been found dead in the fires in northern NSW. \u201cFirefighters have located the remains of a person in a vehicle at the Kangawalla fire, near Glen Innes. Two people remain unaccounted for after yesterday\u2019s bushfires. NSW RFS is working with NSW police,\u201d RFS said in a statement. More details to follow. The NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, has told the ABC that while conditions have eased a little on Saturday morning, conditions will worsen again early next week. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not expecting any rain. What we need is lots of rain. We need inches of rain and we\u2019re simply not getting that. Over the next couple of days we\u2019re still expecting dry conditions to dominate. Yes, the temperatures have backed off but we\u2019re still seeing breezy conditions. As we head into particularly Tuesday, the early indications I\u2019ve seen is we\u2019re expecting another day of difficult fire danger conditions. We\u2019re probably expecting widespread total fire bans again, as a result of severe and extreme fire danger. But unfortunately the early indications I\u2019m seeing is that we\u2019re expecting a much larger geographic area across New South Wales to be affected by that worsening weather conditions as we head into early next week. Beyond that, as the news reports are indicating, we\u2019re expecting a cyclical pattern of weather, week after week after week, of increased, elevated fire dangers to come and go. The longer-range forecast for summer is also not good. Unfortunately over the coming months, there\u2019s no signal for rain, but quite the opposite: above-average temperatures, below-average rainfall. We haven\u2019t got into the worst of our traditional fire danger period yet. Summer is only around the corner. Good morning, we will be following the continuing fire crises across the country throughout the day. For those in fire-affected areas, please listen to your local emergency broadcaster, and follow instructions from fire crews and authorities. There are multiple warnings still current and the situation remains volatile. See online updates for New South Wales and Queensland. What we know so far: At least 100 homes have been destroyed in fires across NSW. The NSW Rural Fire Service has confirmed there are people unaccounted for from the Rappville fire in northern NSW. There have been multiple reports of people trapped in their homes by blazes. 30 people have been injured, including 19 firefighters At the peak of the crisis on Friday, 17 bushfires were burning at emergency level yesterday: 50 more were burning out of control, fanned by hot and windy conditions. Conditions have eased Saturday, but a wind change is expected to bring strong winds and could push fires in new directions. Conditions are expected to again deteriorate next week. \u201cWe are still seeing erratic and dangerous fire behaviour across the remainder of fire grounds, which continues to pose a threat to homes,\u201d the RFS said.",

      "body": "<p>You break up with your partner and move out, and at around the same time you get a bombshell tax demand for \u00a36,000 for overpaid child benefit that she had been claiming. Most of the bill relates to money that your ex received for two children who are not even biologically yours. Yet the tax authorities aren\u2019t pursuing her for the money, or the kids\u2019 natural father \u2013 they have come after you.</p> <p>That\u2019s the situation for one Midlands man in a case that throws a spotlight on rules that one top accountancy body has called a potential \u201creputational disaster\u201d for HM Revenue &amp; Customs.</p> <p>The tax situation for claimants of child benefit is highly controversial. If you or your partner earn more than \u00a350,000 a year, the benefit is progressively clawed back through the tax system, until it\u2019s worth nothing on incomes over \u00a360,000.</p> <p>It means a couple where both earn \u00a345,000, giving a household income of \u00a390,000, obtain the full value of child benefit, but a couple where one earns \u00a360,000 and the other is not working effectively receive no benefit.</p> <p>It also means that when a couple breaks up, and HMRC discover that the child benefit paid to the mother should be clawed back, they may chase the former partner for the money \u2013 a person who may not even be the biological father, and may not have been married to the mother.</p> <p>When the child benefit clawback system came into force \u2013 it\u2019s called the High Income Child Benefit Charge \u2013 the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales warned about this very issue, calling the legislation seriously flawed in principle and practice.</p> <p>\u201cHMRC will be using the tax system to claw back from one individual a benefit paid to another \u2026 in the period between the benefit being paid and then clawed back, the couple could be separated, involved in an acrimonious divorce, or completely out of touch with each other,\u201d it said.</p> <p>This is pretty much the situation that Phil Adams* finds himself in. He says he was stunned to receive a letter from HMRC telling him he owes the huge sum relating to a period from 2014 to 2017. He says he is being penalised for money that he neither applied for nor received.</p> <p>Adams has appealed against the bill, but this has been rejected. HMRC rules are clear that the liability always falls on the higher-earning partner. And it doesn\u2019t matter if the child who is, or was, living with you is not your own.</p> <p>Adams says he received a letter out of the blue in May this year telling him he owed \u00a36,233 \u2013 later reduced to \u00a36,130. Most of this \u2013 just over \u00a35,000 \u2013 relates to child benefit cash paid to his then-partner during the 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 tax years. The rest is penalties.</p> <p>Critics will point out that Adams\u2019 ignorance of the rules is no excuse, and agree with HMRC\u2019s view that \u201cthe legislation regarding this matter is clear.\u201d</p> <p>But Adams says that in 2012 \u2013 which is when the government unveiled a publicity campaign about the new tax regime ahead of its 2013 launch \u2013 he was single with no children and earning a lot less than \u00a350,000, so this wouldn\u2019t have been on his radar at all.</p> <p>He and his now ex-partner moved in together in early 2014. It was also at around that time that his salary went over the \u00a350,000 threshold after he got a new job.</p> <p>Adams\u2019 then-partner already had two children from a previous relationship and had been receiving child benefit since before they met, he says. They then had a child of their own, who was born at the end of 2016. However, the couple separated earlier this year.</p> <p>He says he believes his then-partner submitted a claim for child benefit following the birth of their child, at which point she may well have been informed about the tax charge regime \u2013 but says that she kept him in the dark about it.</p> <p>He says if he had been aware of what was happening, he would have contacted the relevant department to get their child benefit payments stopped due to his high income. However, he adds that even if he had done that, his then-partner could have simply contacted the child benefit department to get the payments restarted without his knowledge.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no reasonable way for someone in my position to stop child benefit payments to their partner \u2026 It was not myself but my partner that has claimed this child benefit, and therefore the responsibility to return this money needs to lie with her,\u201d says Adams.</p> <p>He appealed the HMRC ruling, but was told last month that he had lost his case, so he decided to take the matter to an independent tribunal, which will now make a final decision.</p> <p>In its letter to Adams, HMRC makes clear that the obligation is on the individual to notify HMRC of their liability. \u201cIt is not HMRC\u2019s obligation to notify them of their liability,\u201d it said. The letter concluded that Adams did not have a \u201creasonable excuse or special circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>HMRC says the tax charge was brought in \u201cto ensure support is targeted at those who need it most\u201d. It told Guardian Money that a higher earner is liable to pay the tax charge for the period he or she is living with someone who is a child benefit recipient. \u201cThe important thing is whether the person claiming child benefit, or their partner, has income over \u00a350,000, and not whether they are the biological parent of the child.\u201d</p> <p><em>* Not his real name</em></p> <h2>How the tax charge works</h2> <p>With child benefit, you get \u00a320.70 a week, or \u00a31,076 a year, for the oldest child, and \u00a313.70 a week, or \u00a3712 a year, per additional child. But this is clawed back via the tax system if either you or your partner have an adjusted net income of more than \u00a350,000. The tax charge is 1% of the amount of child benefit for each \u00a3100 of income on a sliding scale between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000. For those earning more than \u00a360,000 the charge is 100% \u2013 in effect, they receive no child benefit. You can choose to opt out of getting child benefit payments and thereby avoid the charge, and many families have done this.</p> <p>Your adjustable net income is your total taxable income (that is, basic salary plus benefits you get from your job, rental income and so on), minus things such as pension contributions and gift-aided donations to charity.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You break up with your partner and move out, and at around the same time you get a bombshell tax demand for \u00a36,000 for overpaid child benefit that she had been claiming. Most of the bill relates to money that your ex received for two children who are not even biologically yours. Yet the tax authorities aren\u2019t pursuing her for the money, or the kids\u2019 natural father \u2013 they have come after you. That\u2019s the situation for one Midlands man in a case that throws a spotlight on rules that one top accountancy body has called a potential \u201creputational disaster\u201d for HM Revenue &amp; Customs. The tax situation for claimants of child benefit is highly controversial. If you or your partner earn more than \u00a350,000 a year, the benefit is progressively clawed back through the tax system, until it\u2019s worth nothing on incomes over \u00a360,000. It means a couple where both earn \u00a345,000, giving a household income of \u00a390,000, obtain the full value of child benefit, but a couple where one earns \u00a360,000 and the other is not working effectively receive no benefit. It also means that when a couple breaks up, and HMRC discover that the child benefit paid to the mother should be clawed back, they may chase the former partner for the money \u2013 a person who may not even be the biological father, and may not have been married to the mother. When the child benefit clawback system came into force \u2013 it\u2019s called the High Income Child Benefit Charge \u2013 the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales warned about this very issue, calling the legislation seriously flawed in principle and practice. \u201cHMRC will be using the tax system to claw back from one individual a benefit paid to another \u2026 in the period between the benefit being paid and then clawed back, the couple could be separated, involved in an acrimonious divorce, or completely out of touch with each other,\u201d it said. This is pretty much the situation that Phil Adams* finds himself in. He says he was stunned to receive a letter from HMRC telling him he owes the huge sum relating to a period from 2014 to 2017. He says he is being penalised for money that he neither applied for nor received. Adams has appealed against the bill, but this has been rejected. HMRC rules are clear that the liability always falls on the higher-earning partner. And it doesn\u2019t matter if the child who is, or was, living with you is not your own. Adams says he received a letter out of the blue in May this year telling him he owed \u00a36,233 \u2013 later reduced to \u00a36,130. Most of this \u2013 just over \u00a35,000 \u2013 relates to child benefit cash paid to his then-partner during the 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 tax years. The rest is penalties. Critics will point out that Adams\u2019 ignorance of the rules is no excuse, and agree with HMRC\u2019s view that \u201cthe legislation regarding this matter is clear.\u201d But Adams says that in 2012 \u2013 which is when the government unveiled a publicity campaign about the new tax regime ahead of its 2013 launch \u2013 he was single with no children and earning a lot less than \u00a350,000, so this wouldn\u2019t have been on his radar at all. He and his now ex-partner moved in together in early 2014. It was also at around that time that his salary went over the \u00a350,000 threshold after he got a new job. Adams\u2019 then-partner already had two children from a previous relationship and had been receiving child benefit since before they met, he says. They then had a child of their own, who was born at the end of 2016. However, the couple separated earlier this year. He says he believes his then-partner submitted a claim for child benefit following the birth of their child, at which point she may well have been informed about the tax charge regime \u2013 but says that she kept him in the dark about it. He says if he had been aware of what was happening, he would have contacted the relevant department to get their child benefit payments stopped due to his high income. However, he adds that even if he had done that, his then-partner could have simply contacted the child benefit department to get the payments restarted without his knowledge. \u201cThere is no reasonable way for someone in my position to stop child benefit payments to their partner \u2026 It was not myself but my partner that has claimed this child benefit, and therefore the responsibility to return this money needs to lie with her,\u201d says Adams. He appealed the HMRC ruling, but was told last month that he had lost his case, so he decided to take the matter to an independent tribunal, which will now make a final decision. In its letter to Adams, HMRC makes clear that the obligation is on the individual to notify HMRC of their liability. \u201cIt is not HMRC\u2019s obligation to notify them of their liability,\u201d it said. The letter concluded that Adams did not have a \u201creasonable excuse or special circumstances\u201d. HMRC says the tax charge was brought in \u201cto ensure support is targeted at those who need it most\u201d. It told Guardian Money that a higher earner is liable to pay the tax charge for the period he or she is living with someone who is a child benefit recipient. \u201cThe important thing is whether the person claiming child benefit, or their partner, has income over \u00a350,000, and not whether they are the biological parent of the child.\u201d * Not his real name How the tax charge works With child benefit, you get \u00a320.70 a week, or \u00a31,076 a year, for the oldest child, and \u00a313.70 a week, or \u00a3712 a year, per additional child. But this is clawed back via the tax system if either you or your partner have an adjusted net income of more than \u00a350,000. The tax charge is 1% of the amount of child benefit for each \u00a3100 of income on a sliding scale between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000. For those earning more than \u00a360,000 the charge is 100% \u2013 in effect, they receive no child benefit. You can choose to opt out of getting child benefit payments and thereby avoid the charge, and many families have done this. Your adjustable net income is your total taxable income (that is, basic salary plus benefits you get from your job, rental income and so on), minus things such as pension contributions and gift-aided donations to charity.",

But start with the handstand. It looks like a thing you can either do or not do, but there is a nursery slope: try it at home, if you like, but don\u2019t sue me if you fall on your nose. Plant both hands on the floor, fingers splayed, the inside of your elbows facing outwards. Put your butt in the air, as if you\u2019re doing a downward dog. Oh, sorry, go back a stage and make sure there is a wall about a foot and a half behind your hands. Plant one foot on it, then the other, as if you\u2019re crouching for the start of a race, except in the air, against a wall. Then see if you can get one leg away from the wall, pointing up straight towards the sky, and write your name in the air with your toe. Step two is getting stable enough to keep it straight. Step three is kicking the other leg up to meet it. I got nowhere near halfway to the first step, but found it deeply engrossing.

The theory is that you unlock your brain\u2019s full functionality by forcing it to concentrate. After that, try your range of movement again; it is greater. The difference wasn\u2019t immense; but it was noticeable. \u201cAll the things you thought you had to do by stretching,\u201d Stewart said, \u201cinstead you have to wake up the part of your brain that prefers to stay dormant.\u201d Dividing the acrobat studio into four stations, we worked on handstands, trampoline jumps, juggling and a fiendish move with a hula hoop called roll skipping, which looked possible, but wasn\u2019t. But start with the handstand. It looks like a thing you can either do or not do, but there is a nursery slope: try it at home, if you like, but don\u2019t sue me if you fall on your nose. Plant both hands on the floor, fingers splayed, the inside of your elbows facing outwards. Put your butt in the air, as if you\u2019re doing a downward dog. Oh, sorry, go back a stage and make sure there is a wall about a foot and a half behind your hands. Plant one foot on it, then the other, as if you\u2019re crouching for the start of a race, except in the air, against a wall. Then see if you can get one leg away from the wall, pointing up straight towards the sky, and write your name in the air with your toe. Step two is getting stable enough to keep it straight. Step three is kicking the other leg up to meet it. I got nowhere near halfway to the first step, but found it deeply engrossing. Juggling, on the other hand, is a foreign country. What I learned There\u2019s a ton of fitness-building, and not especially circus-related circuits involved: bunny hops, press-ups, bear crawls. Think of it as an aerobic workout, rather than a midlife crisis.",

Slowly, the pair become more like Thelma and Louise, escaping retro-hued suburbia for increasingly high-stakes scrapes, from a carjacking to a run-in with a serial rapist. If this sounds heavy-going on paper, in reality it is a show that tackles difficult themes with a sardonic edginess and an often frantic pace that is in keeping with its comic-book origins.</p> <p>Although neither Barden or Lawther are as nihilistic as their alter egos, there are some parallels: she is infinitely charming, a little spiky and restless, mockingly describing herself as \u201ca degenerate\u201d, while he has a more reflective, English-student vibe, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/19/older-generations-will-never-understand-extinction-rebellion-xr-youth-on-being-heard\">Extinction Rebellion</a> badge pinned to the lapel of his coat. Really, though, they are a riot. They erupt into fits of giggles as they recount the story of how James\u2019s house was knocked down in real life two days after the first season wrapped, with the character relocating to his car this season as a result of its demolition. \u201cIt\u2019s such a James thing,\u201d says Barden. \u201cCharlie [Covell, the show\u2019s writer] didn\u2019t actually put that in the script because even she was like, that\u2019s too much.\u201d \u201cMy house has disappeared!\u201d Lawther adds, fake-crying.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnKr48y5gCA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fnKr48y5gCA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Ordinarily, the leads of a successful TV show would not be banished to the basement, especially not a show that \u2013 according to Netflix\u2019s chief content officer Ted Sarandos \u2013 has been an \u201castounding\u201d success for the streaming service, and which also broke records on All 4. But there is good reason for it: at the end of the first season, James was seemingly killed in a police chase. While fans will by now know about Lawther\u2019s return \u2013 the second season dropped in one go on Monday \u2013 it was kept under wraps until the show\u2019s transmission (promo posters featured Alyssa in a wedding dress, alongside an urn that many presumed contained James\u2019s ashes). </p> <p>Although the idea of killing James off proved largely unpopular with fans, a lot of theories swirled online prior to the show airing. \u201cSome of them are amazing,\u201d says Lawther, wide-eyed. \u201cAlyssa being haunted by the ghost of James is an amazing idea. Another one was that it was Alyssa [who] was shot [by the police], and then season two becomes about them trying to break her out of jail.\u201d Barden has been offering further curveballs in interviews. \u201cPeople have been like: \u2018Is James dead,\u2019 and my answer is: \u2018Am I dead?!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Adapted by actor Covell from Charles Forsman\u2019s graphic novel and boosted by a Netflix deal that saw the series broadcast internationally, TEOTFW is not your usual teen show. As indebted to Tarantino as it is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/21/why-the-new-twin-peaks-is-way-better-than-the-original\">Twin Peaks</a>, its first season lunges from murderers to middle-aged perverts, attempted sexual assault to the awkward chemistry between two female police detectives, all punctuated by dark gags and an obscure, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/26/graham-coxon-interview-i-was-a-mardy-brat-in-my-20s-blur\">fittingly morose soundtrack curated by Blur\u2019s Graham Coxon</a>. The setting is a disorienting mix of British small-town-ness and Americana, via roadside diners and sprawling, overgrown forests. Although unconventional in many ways, it presents a classic conundrum: a tale of a will-they-won\u2019t-they couple who are as good for each other as they are bad.</p> <p>It is a mix that has proved hugely successful. As well as overshooting the broadcasters\u2019 expectations, The End of the F***ing World has become one of those shows as likely to be dissected by teens on the internet as by heavyweight critics. It bridges the gap between Tumblr fandom and awards shows, having been nominated for both a Bafta and an Emmy.</p> <p>While the pair admit that it is difficult to comprehend how big a phenomenon something is when you are actually in it, they know that hanging out in a shiny hotel bar would have given the game away. Barden has been spotted in places as obscure as a branch of Target in Ohio, while Lawther is often accosted in the street, although sometimes people get a bit confused. \u201cI get people coming up to me and saying: \u2018Ah, Asa Butterfield, I loved you in [Netflix series] Sex Education,\u2019\u201d he admits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49673a404aa3cfcba6699bf3f9f67b393665d60b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49673a404aa3cfcba6699bf3f9f67b393665d60b/0_110_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Ackie as Bonnie (far right) with Karl Collins and Nadine Marshall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New blood... Naomi Ackie as Bonnie (far right) with Karl Collins and Nadine Marshall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Spence/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lawther is not your average matinee idol: he looks far younger than his 24 years, is faultlessly polite and often uses interviews to get deep into subjects such as politics and why private schools should be abolished (he attended one himself, during a childhood in Hampshire which he previously described as a \u201cmiddle-class bubble\u201d).

It\u2019s not about his violence towards Alyssa, it\u2019s about him understanding how he feels and working out that actually he\u2019s not a psychopath, he\u2019s just very, very, very sad.\u201d</p> <p>Barden, meanwhile, was born in North Yorkshire and landed a breakout role in Coronation Street at the age of 14, leading to parts in dramas and odd offbeat films such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/15/the-lobster-review-cannes-film-festival-2015\">Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s The Lobster</a>. Alyssa wasn\u2019t the kind of role she was used to playing but, says the 27-year-old, reclining on an office chair with more than a bit of her character\u2019s forthrightness about her, it was a welcome challenge.</p> <p>\u201cAt first it was just another part that I wanted to do, then it was: \u2018Oh this is quite funny.\u2019 As I got closer to when we actually filmed it, it turned into: \u2018Nobody else [is] giving me an opportunity to do anything like this,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAt the time when we finally made it, I was continuously being told I would never be a lead in anything. I don\u2019t fit the mould: I\u2019m not trained, I have a working-class background and I didn\u2019t want to do a grooming storyline or play a maid every time. I wanted to lead an interesting TV show. So in the end [this] was a complete breath of fresh air.\u201d</p> <p>She and Lawther met for the first time during the casting process in LA, on a trip that was equal amounts of work and play. \u201cOur relationship started by being dry-iced in a nightclub and then suddenly feeling completely, instinctively safe with you when we couldn\u2019t see anything for two minutes,\u201d Barden explains. \u201cYou make people feel very safe on- and off-camera, and I think that\u2019s how Alyssa and James make each other feel as well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f0d5da72f23d4a61a0b2b9d71a984a1b9a2571c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f0d5da72f23d4a61a0b2b9d71a984a1b9a2571c/116_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Barden as Alyssa and Alex Lawther as James.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natural bored killers...

      "bodyText": "Alex Lawther and Jessica Barden bound towards each other in a basement boardroom in Channel 4\u2019s London offices and hug like long-lost siblings. \u201cI\u2019m wearing my End of the F***ing World necklace,\u201d Barden tells Lawther proudly, pointing to one of those heart pendants you break apart and share with a friend. Lawther shakes his head. \u201cAh, I didn\u2019t put mine on today,\u201d he says, sounding as if he\u2019s committed a mortal sin, \u201cbut I\u2019ll definitely wear it to the launch\u201d. It is a far cry from their first meeting in the darkly comic Channel 4/Netflix hit, where Lawther\u2019s character, James \u2013 a luckless teen with psychopathic traits \u2013 plots to murder Barden\u2019s Alyssa. Slowly, the pair become more like Thelma and Louise, escaping retro-hued suburbia for increasingly high-stakes scrapes, from a carjacking to a run-in with a serial rapist. If this sounds heavy-going on paper, in reality it is a show that tackles difficult themes with a sardonic edginess and an often frantic pace that is in keeping with its comic-book origins. Although neither Barden or Lawther are as nihilistic as their alter egos, there are some parallels: she is infinitely charming, a little spiky and restless, mockingly describing herself as \u201ca degenerate\u201d, while he has a more reflective, English-student vibe, an Extinction Rebellion badge pinned to the lapel of his coat. Really, though, they are a riot. They erupt into fits of giggles as they recount the story of how James\u2019s house was knocked down in real life two days after the first season wrapped, with the character relocating to his car this season as a result of its demolition. \u201cIt\u2019s such a James thing,\u201d says Barden. \u201cCharlie [Covell, the show\u2019s writer] didn\u2019t actually put that in the script because even she was like, that\u2019s too much.\u201d \u201cMy house has disappeared!\u201d Lawther adds, fake-crying. Ordinarily, the leads of a successful TV show would not be banished to the basement, especially not a show that \u2013 according to Netflix\u2019s chief content officer Ted Sarandos \u2013 has been an \u201castounding\u201d success for the streaming service, and which also broke records on All 4. But there is good reason for it: at the end of the first season, James was seemingly killed in a police chase. While fans will by now know about Lawther\u2019s return \u2013 the second season dropped in one go on Monday \u2013 it was kept under wraps until the show\u2019s transmission (promo posters featured Alyssa in a wedding dress, alongside an urn that many presumed contained James\u2019s ashes). Although the idea of killing James off proved largely unpopular with fans, a lot of theories swirled online prior to the show airing. \u201cSome of them are amazing,\u201d says Lawther, wide-eyed. \u201cAlyssa being haunted by the ghost of James is an amazing idea. Another one was that it was Alyssa [who] was shot [by the police], and then season two becomes about them trying to break her out of jail.\u201d Barden has been offering further curveballs in interviews. \u201cPeople have been like: \u2018Is James dead,\u2019 and my answer is: \u2018Am I dead?!\u2019\u201d Adapted by actor Covell from Charles Forsman\u2019s graphic novel and boosted by a Netflix deal that saw the series broadcast internationally, TEOTFW is not your usual teen show. As indebted to Tarantino as it is to Twin Peaks, its first season lunges from murderers to middle-aged perverts, attempted sexual assault to the awkward chemistry between two female police detectives, all punctuated by dark gags and an obscure, fittingly morose soundtrack curated by Blur\u2019s Graham Coxon. The setting is a disorienting mix of British small-town-ness and Americana, via roadside diners and sprawling, overgrown forests. Although unconventional in many ways, it presents a classic conundrum: a tale of a will-they-won\u2019t-they couple who are as good for each other as they are bad. It is a mix that has proved hugely successful. As well as overshooting the broadcasters\u2019 expectations, The End of the F***ing World has become one of those shows as likely to be dissected by teens on the internet as by heavyweight critics. It bridges the gap between Tumblr fandom and awards shows, having been nominated for both a Bafta and an Emmy. While the pair admit that it is difficult to comprehend how big a phenomenon something is when you are actually in it, they know that hanging out in a shiny hotel bar would have given the game away. Barden has been spotted in places as obscure as a branch of Target in Ohio, while Lawther is often accosted in the street, although sometimes people get a bit confused. \u201cI get people coming up to me and saying: \u2018Ah, Asa Butterfield, I loved you in [Netflix series] Sex Education,\u2019\u201d he admits. Lawther is not your average matinee idol: he looks far younger than his 24 years, is faultlessly polite and often uses interviews to get deep into subjects such as politics and why private schools should be abolished (he attended one himself, during a childhood in Hampshire which he previously described as a \u201cmiddle-class bubble\u201d). He is known for his outsider roles, including a teenage paedophile in Black Mirror\u2019s Shut Up and Dance and a young, enigmatic Alan Turing in 2014 film The Imitation Game. Complex characters appeal to him \u2013 with James being a particularly knotty role to untangle. \u201cInitially, I thought [the show] was about a young man being violent towards a young woman, and I thought: \u2018I\u2019m not really that interested because there\u2019s enough of that around.\u2019 But I realised that James becomes something else. It\u2019s not about his violence towards Alyssa, it\u2019s about him understanding how he feels and working out that actually he\u2019s not a psychopath, he\u2019s just very, very, very sad.\u201d Barden, meanwhile, was born in North Yorkshire and landed a breakout role in Coronation Street at the age of 14, leading to parts in dramas and odd offbeat films such as Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s The Lobster. Alyssa wasn\u2019t the kind of role she was used to playing but, says the 27-year-old, reclining on an office chair with more than a bit of her character\u2019s forthrightness about her, it was a welcome challenge. \u201cAt first it was just another part that I wanted to do, then it was: \u2018Oh this is quite funny.\u2019 As I got closer to when we actually filmed it, it turned into: \u2018Nobody else [is] giving me an opportunity to do anything like this,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAt the time when we finally made it, I was continuously being told I would never be a lead in anything.

Chile came into the match off the back of five consecutive wins, including in the World Cup \u2013 a far cry from just a few years ago when they were delisted from the Fifa world rankings entirely for being \u201cinactive\u201d after not playing a single match for over two years.</p> <p>Australia were in control from the kick-off, with Kerr\u2019s opener coming in just the third minute. Emily Van Egmond, who was given licence to venture further forward than her deeper World Cup role allowed, floated an early free-kick into the six-yard box that Chile failed to clear, with the ball falling right to Kerr\u2019s feet. The ball naturally found the net seconds later.</p> <p>Van Egmond\u2019s higher role was further enabled by the deeper positioning of 34-year-old Aivi Luik, who\u2019d been brought into the starting XI in place of the injured Elise Kellond-Knight and provided the kind of security and motor needed in front of the back four. However, despite being given the opportunity to flaunt her penetrative passing ability, Van Egmond tended towards safer sideways and backwards options, sometimes to the team\u2019s detriment.</p> <p>Although Chile\u2019s Camila Z\u00e1ez had the ball in the back of the net unexpectedly in the 12th minute, her header was called offside. And it wasn\u2019t until the 32<sup>nd</sup> minute that Chile had their second shot of the game, coming through midfielder Daniela Pardo at the top of the box following some rare combination play between Chile\u2019s forward players, but her shot just skimmed over the crossbar.</p> <p>Despite the Matildas\u2019 dominance in possession, Chile defended resolutely, led from the back by PSG goalkeeper and World Cup standout Christiane Endler.</p> <p>Following a livelier start to the second half, Chile soon reverted to their first-half defensive shape and attempted to play on the counter, but to little effect. Indeed, centre-forward Maria Jose Urrutia was subbed off in the 62<sup>nd</sup> minute \u2014 despite a few glimmers of skill, she was almost entirely ineffective and rarely supported in transition moments.</p> <p>A poorly executed free-kick by Australia in the 65<sup>th</sup> minute summed up Australia\u2019s somewhat rusty performance, with Luik, Steph Catley, and Kerr failing to pull off a relatively straightforward training ground routine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/23/sam-kerr-to-move-on-from-australia-but-can-w-league-move-on-from-her\">Sam Kerr to move on from Australia but can W-League move on from her? | Samantha Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kerr scored her second in front of Australia\u2019s active end \u2014 set up in Bankwest\u2019s safe-standing area \u2014 following a more direct long ball from Caitlin Foord, who herself had been largely invisible in the opening half.</p> <p>The goal takes Kerr\u2019s national goal tally up to 38, level with former captain Cheryl Salisbury, but still nine fewer than all-time leader Lisa De Vanna, who conspicuously was not called up for this friendly series.</p> <p>Chloe Logarzo had an opportunity to make it three in the 79<sup>th</sup> minute following some stellar individual dribbling by Ellie Carpenter, whose cut-back found Logarzo coming in at the back post, but she sliced her shot wide.</p> <p>After some more promising attacking moments towards the end of the half, Chile finally pulled one back in the 88<sup>th</sup> minute; Camila S\u00e1ez heading home from a well-taken Carla Guerrero corner.</p> <p>With the news that Kerr will be headed to Europe for the foreseeable future, likely followed by several of her Matildas teammates in the coming years, Australia find themselves at a fork in the road.</p> <p>The W-League, which kicked off its 12<sup>th</sup> season as well this week, is home to 20 of Australia\u2019s national team players, and will play a key role in developing the next generation of stars.

And there\u2019s a lot of things going on around the group with the new CBA, with a record crowd, playing in this stadium, Sam [Kerr] to announce her move, Jenna McCormick making a debut.</p> <p>\u201cSo when you look at that, you have to be pleased. And overall, I think it was such a beautiful occasion and a great week for us.

      "bodyText": "It was a year ago on Sunday that Chile stunned Australia by winning 3-2 in the first of two friendly games in Sydney, a result that threatened the Matildas\u2019 top-six world ranking and contributed to the tumultuous six months that followed the team like a dark cloud into July\u2019s Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup. Playing together for the first time since that ill-fated outing in France, Australia\u2019s dominant performance suggested a new leaf was finally being turned, defeating Chile 2-1 in front of a record-breaking 20,029 people at Bankwest Stadium in Parramatta. The win was the cherry on top of a historic week that saw the Matildas receive a landmark pay deal, making Australia one of the few nations in the world aiming to close the gender pay gap between its men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams. It was an occasion that reflected the progress that Australian women\u2019s football has made on the field as much as off it, with a half-time acknowledgement of the 1978 national team players book-ended by goals from the first potential millionaire Matilda in captain Sam Kerr. Likewise, the healthy contingent of Chile fans toting flags while repeating their well-known World Cup chant \u2014\u201cChi, Chi, Chi, le, le, le; Viva Chile!\u201d\u2014 reflected a shift in the country\u2019s support for the women\u2019s game. Chile came into the match off the back of five consecutive wins, including in the World Cup \u2013 a far cry from just a few years ago when they were delisted from the Fifa world rankings entirely for being \u201cinactive\u201d after not playing a single match for over two years. Australia were in control from the kick-off, with Kerr\u2019s opener coming in just the third minute. Emily Van Egmond, who was given licence to venture further forward than her deeper World Cup role allowed, floated an early free-kick into the six-yard box that Chile failed to clear, with the ball falling right to Kerr\u2019s feet. The ball naturally found the net seconds later. Van Egmond\u2019s higher role was further enabled by the deeper positioning of 34-year-old Aivi Luik, who\u2019d been brought into the starting XI in place of the injured Elise Kellond-Knight and provided the kind of security and motor needed in front of the back four. However, despite being given the opportunity to flaunt her penetrative passing ability, Van Egmond tended towards safer sideways and backwards options, sometimes to the team\u2019s detriment. Although Chile\u2019s Camila Z\u00e1ez had the ball in the back of the net unexpectedly in the 12th minute, her header was called offside. And it wasn\u2019t until the 32nd minute that Chile had their second shot of the game, coming through midfielder Daniela Pardo at the top of the box following some rare combination play between Chile\u2019s forward players, but her shot just skimmed over the crossbar. Despite the Matildas\u2019 dominance in possession, Chile defended resolutely, led from the back by PSG goalkeeper and World Cup standout Christiane Endler. Following a livelier start to the second half, Chile soon reverted to their first-half defensive shape and attempted to play on the counter, but to little effect. Indeed, centre-forward Maria Jose Urrutia was subbed off in the 62nd minute \u2014 despite a few glimmers of skill, she was almost entirely ineffective and rarely supported in transition moments. A poorly executed free-kick by Australia in the 65th minute summed up Australia\u2019s somewhat rusty performance, with Luik, Steph Catley, and Kerr failing to pull off a relatively straightforward training ground routine. Kerr scored her second in front of Australia\u2019s active end \u2014 set up in Bankwest\u2019s safe-standing area \u2014 following a more direct long ball from Caitlin Foord, who herself had been largely invisible in the opening half. The goal takes Kerr\u2019s national goal tally up to 38, level with former captain Cheryl Salisbury, but still nine fewer than all-time leader Lisa De Vanna, who conspicuously was not called up for this friendly series. Chloe Logarzo had an opportunity to make it three in the 79th minute following some stellar individual dribbling by Ellie Carpenter, whose cut-back found Logarzo coming in at the back post, but she sliced her shot wide. After some more promising attacking moments towards the end of the half, Chile finally pulled one back in the 88th minute; Camila S\u00e1ez heading home from a well-taken Carla Guerrero corner. With the news that Kerr will be headed to Europe for the foreseeable future, likely followed by several of her Matildas teammates in the coming years, Australia find themselves at a fork in the road. The W-League, which kicked off its 12th season as well this week, is home to 20 of Australia\u2019s national team players, and will play a key role in developing the next generation of stars. Amidst its transition to independence, one hopes that its response to the domestic booms occurring elsewhere \u2014 especially Europe, where almost half of Chile\u2019s national team are based \u2014 emboldens it to make the steps necessary to keep up, lest we be speaking of this current Matildas team in the same vein as what we do of the Socceroos\u2019 \u201cgolden generation\u201d: that is, in the past tense. Australia take on Chile in the second friendly game in Adelaide on Tuesday night, and one hopes they can find another gear before heading into their first Olympic qualifiers in February. In the context of off-field events, head coach Ante Milicic was pleased with the performance. \u201cFor the majority of the game we were decent and in control, but at the same time I felt the game should\u2019ve been over a lot earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cComing into the game, we knew that we hadn\u2019t played since the World Cup and the opponent had played four. And there\u2019s a lot of things going on around the group with the new CBA, with a record crowd, playing in this stadium, Sam [Kerr] to announce her move, Jenna McCormick making a debut. \u201cSo when you look at that, you have to be pleased. And overall, I think it was such a beautiful occasion and a great week for us. It\u2019s fitting that we\u2019ve got the result that in the end I feel that we thoroughly deserved.\u201d Despite conceding late, Milicic was full of praise for his newer players, particularly debutante McCormick. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased for her,\u201d he said. \u201cYou talk about making your debut. How memorable is the occasion going to be with this stadium, this crowd, to get a win. She was dominant. She brought us a lot of that physical aspect that we needed from a centre-back and I thought what we ask of our centre-backs with the ball; you need to be brave. It\u2019s a new way of playing for her at this level and she was fantastic. \u201cWe\u2019re really looking at creating depth, particularly in that department. We all know what happened at the World Cup with [Claire Polkinghorne] getting injured in game one and with Laura Alleway getting injured in the pre-camp, so I think we might just have one there in Jenna.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It felt like a normal delivery. I didn\u2019t expect it to, but it did. The pain of labour was immediately buffered by that overwhelming and total love that sweeps in the moment a mother holds her baby. The power of that feeling is a one-off \u2013 there is nothing to compare it to. But it was the joyful stupor, the sense of celebration, that took me by surprise. I didn\u2019t expect to feel joy. Before I could finish wondering why I hadn\u2019t cried, a shadow slipped over me as I said you looked too perfect to have suffered death in my womb. And then reality, absent until that point, entered. Your life\u2019s cry would never come. I knew this before I delivered you. But to feel this was entirely different. The midwives left us alone and we held you, your dad and I, sleeping with you for hours. Then we left the hospital empty-handed. It\u2019s indescribable, the sadness of that feeling. I won\u2019t even try to write that one down. I just recall the rush of new parents, proudly exiting the hospital with their babies strapped into brand new Which? Best Buy car seats. How I wanted to be among that number. Back home, the walls of our empty house buried me alive each night as flowing milk soaked my skin, and my womb still moved with your phantom kicks. I woke in the dark to your cries. But you were never there. Years have passed. I want to believe you are the angel on my shoulder, as the midwife described you. I want to believe that you are eternally at rest in the arms of your departed grandparents. I have to believe this. My road to peace has been paved with such visions. I failed to give you a life that would flourish. I still don\u2019t know why, and I never will. It all went so terribly wrong. I am so sorry, my beloved, precious daughter. One of my teachers used to say, \u201cThat\u2019s just the way the cookie crumbles.\u201d It rings so hollow and yet that\u2019s the answer to all my unanswerable questions: that\u2019s just the way the cookie crumbles.

      "bodyText": "A record home crowd in to witness the Matildas\u2019 first competitive hit-out post France World Cup. Some cobwebs and heavy legs - no doubt it\u2019s been a punishing week in camp, but also some decent play in passages. Australia dominated possession and offered a lot more going forward, all-in-all, a solid showing from the Matildas. Jenna McCormick made her international debut and looked composed in the heart of defence, while veteran Aivi Luik put in a trademarked composed performance ahead of the back four. Ellie Carpenter and Hayley Raso posed the Chileans all sorts of headaches down the right flank, while who else - Captain Kerr - was once again the spearhead up top. The eighth time in her career she\u2019s scored a brace (or more) in one match for the Matildas. Fans will go home happy, but the coaching staff will be disappointed at failing to secure a clean sheet - something that\u2019s been incredibly elusive since Ante Milicic has taken over. These two sides now have three days to freshen up before they face each other again in Adelaide. Thanks for your company - we\u2019ll see you again then! Sam Kerr post-match saying she thought the Matildas performed well for 75 minutes but the skipper was very disappointed with the final minutes and the late concession. She wasn\u2019t too disappointed with Chile\u2019s set defence - saying it represented a new challenge for Australia to try and unpick and control possession. And there\u2019s the whistle! A late scare, but in truth it was a match they looked in fair control, the Matildas. No overt celebrations from Australia, even a small shake of the head from Sam Kerr. You imagine a clean sheet was a big talking point pre-game. But they get the result, even if the performance was a touch scratchy. 90 + 1 min: Three minutes added on, and the fair contingent of Chilean fans comes to life late on, celebrating their side\u2019s goal. Some tired bodies out there for the Matildas. You\u2019d imagine Milicic would have liked to make a few more changes but they\u2019re short a few bodies with a reduced squad to choose from. 89 min: Hello. A bit of late excitement, as the defender Saez steals in at the near post unmarked! It was a straight forward corner - should Williams have had that covered, or was it Carpenter who lost her player? Either way, she ghosted through paper-thin resistance to head into an empty net, the Rayo Vallecano defender. A late blot on the copybook, and another clean sheet goes begging. 88 min: Xamora is released by a long ball and Checker does well to force her a little wide, but it\u2019s an excellent shot and Williams does even better to tip it round the post! 86 min: 20,029 the reported crowd - which is officially a record for a Matildas match on home soil. Great turn out, and a great day out in the sun at Parramatta Stadium. 84 min: Williams off her line to sweep ahead of Zamora, and she might have taken a slight knock, the veteran \u2018keeper, who collects a shin to the face. Hopefully she\u2019s okay. And it\u2019s the last of the outfielder players, Jenna McCormick comes off and it\u2019s a long-awaited return for Emma Checker. 82 min: The Matildas enjoying some patient possession at the back, just taking the sting out of proceedings after a frenetic few minutes. Kerr is clattered just outside the box, and that did look a freekick. Nothing given. A wry look on the skipper\u2019s face. 79 min: Another rampaging run from Carpenter - it comes across for Gielnik who doesn\u2019t connect cleanly, it falls to Logarzo - free at the back post - and she skims the side netting! What a miss - what a let off for Chile, as the midfielder stretched for it, and just flicked it the wrong side of the post. 77 min: Chile now with a set piece from deep, but Guerrero\u2019s strike isn\u2019t clean and sails well wide of Williams\u2019 goal. Has she had to make a save today, yet? No more than one, surely, if at all. 74 min: And a second sub from Milicic - it\u2019s Emily Gielnik on for Raso, like for like down the right flank. Logarzo and Catley combine well, and they set up a shooting opportunity for Harrison, but the Sydney local lifts it over the top! Great chance, she throws her head back in disappointment. 71 min: Foord finally finds the right release, and it\u2019s Kerr through one-on-one with Endler. The big \u2018keeper spreads herself and gets a slight hand on it, but can\u2019t prevent it from wriggling under her body. It\u2019s a brace for captain Kerr. She scores for country, she scores for club. What a phenomenon. 69 min: It\u2019s a reduced bench for Milicic, with injuries in camp, late withdrawals and non-selections - just three outfield players to choose from. And one of those becomes Australia\u2019s first sub - as Harrison comes on for Van Egmond. 67 min: Chile showing a bit more attacking intent this half, as Lara looks to get a move going down their left. It breaks down before Logarzo almost gets things going with a smart give-and-go. Raso colliding heavily with Guerrero - it\u2019s heavy contact, and the Chilean stays down. 64 min: Foord earns a freekick from the new face Galaz, who has just arrived as a sub. Aedo becomes the first in the book for a bit of backchat. The Matildas try a set piece routine, but it doesn\u2019t come off. Not the best use of a set piece, but what are friendlies for if not to experiment? 61 min: A drinks break for both sides on the hour mark. It\u2019s a warm day in Sydney. Not that the fans mind the break - great singing and chanting inside this fine footballing stadium. 58 min: Santo with a strong challenge on Kerr on the edge of the box. Now Van Egmond is just a little slow in finding Raso, and the winger expresses her discontent. Are they a little sluggish at times, the Matildas? Is this signs of a hard week in camp, and perhaps some heavy legs on show? A disappointing off-the-field situation at Parramatta Stadium. There are of course rules in place from Fifa about politic messages inside stadiums, but you have to think a bit of common sense could go a long way. How dispiriting for these Chilean fans: 54 min: Carpenter with another marauding run down the right, and tries to fire a ball centrally but again Chile\u2019s defence scrambles well. They\u2019re getting a workout at the back, but one set piece aside, have largely stood up to the test. 51 min: Foord looks to feed Kerr, but she\u2019s marginally off the striker. They\u2019re not quite on the wavelength today - Australia\u2019s almost telepathic forwards. Carpenter now looks to find Kerr, but it doesn\u2019t stick. 48 min: A series of corners for Chile, this is a better start for the visitors, but the Matildas do well to clear their lines. Logarzo now pinged for what you could only call a \u201crobust\u201d challenge from behind. A bit naughty, that. Pardo appears to not be suffering ill-effect. Second half! 45 min: No rest for the wicked, we\u2019re back out at Parramatta Stadium and the home fans are sounding in fair voice. One change for Chile at the break, as Australia pick up where they left off. So - your thoughts on that first half? It was a quality strike from Kerr, but from a set piece. Have the Matildas created enough from open play? There\u2019s criticism from some quarters that the build up play is a little heavily patterned, or over-rehearsed - is that your read? 45 min: Chile with a rare foray into the Matildas\u2019 back third, can they conjure anything just before the half? It\u2019s a deep cross from Lara, but it\u2019s overhit. And there\u2019s the final whistle. Sam Kerr, who else, has proved the difference again so far. Her outrageous form just continues in the green &amp; gold. 43 min: Clever ball into the box from Logarzo - she feeds Raso, and again it\u2019s a brilliant interception from the \u2018keeper, Endler. She\u2019s so quick to read the play and so brave in diving at the feet of attackers. Brilliantly stuff. 40 min: Polkinghorne with a rare chance to drive forward. That\u2019s another feature of the Milicic era, looking to have centre backs that are comfortable in possession, and happy to initiate play, ball at the feet. 37 min: This is good crisp stuff from the Matildas and again it\u2019s the overload down the right hand side that creates an opening. Carpenter with a terrific ball across the face.. but it just avoids Kerr! What a chance - great build up, Australia. 35 min: Matildas corner and it\u2019s a terrific claim from Endler. Haven\u2019t we seen an improvement in the goalkeeping stakes in women\u2019s football across the last five years or so. And she\u2019s one of the best, Endler. She was long-listed on the World Cup players of the tournament in France. Quality player. 33 min: Ooph! That\u2019s a blistering strike from Chile, and it only just flies over the crossbar. A lovely move, Urrutia prominent, before laying off a ball for Pardo from midfield who thumps an effort that has Williams flying. And that\u2019s the danger - for all their early possession, the Matildas, if that goes in we\u2019re all square! Great cat and mouse stuff. 30 min: Desperate defence from Soto - this has been a good little patch from the Matildas, who are beginning to lay siege to the Chilean goalbox. 29 min: Foord now bursting through the centre - she has both Kerr and Raso ahead of her, but she opts for the latter, and Endler flies off her line to save at the feet. Great \u2018keeping from the Chilean skipper. 26 min: Catley and Foord combine well down the left - but it\u2019s a crucial interception by Chile\u2019s Lopez, who anticipates the cutback. Despite the bright start it\u2019s a slightly tense Milicic pacing the touchline - he\u2019s eager no doubt to be working on a bunch of combinations ahead of Tokyo, and there have been a few passes here and there going astray. 22 min: Speaking of the youngster, it\u2019s Carpenter who sparks a terrific opening down the right, but Raso can\u2019t quite control her firmly struck pass, and the Chilean defenders step in and clear. It looks like a back-five so far for Chile, and they\u2019re definitely working overtime early on. The problem with a packed defence is of course finding outlets to attack with once they do get the ball. 20 min: Van Egmond rises well to head an effort goalwards. She was found brilliantly by the vice-captain Catley - what a picture of consistency she\u2019s been over the years. She\u2019s a player we don\u2019t talk about as much with the rise of young guns like Carpenter, but as we saw at the World Cup, she\u2019s still absolutely crucial to the team. 17 min: Australia with a corner and it\u2019s clipped in by Luik. Van Egmond looks to fire in a second ball but she can\u2019t beat the first line of defence. Chile are struggling to find sustained possession, as the Matildas look to press and prevent them from playing out from the back. So far, it\u2019s very effective. 15 min: Australia with two-thirds of possession early on - it\u2019s the patient style we\u2019ve become familiar with under coach Milicic, but they still look to play vertically when they can to hit the obvious threats of Kerr, Foord and Raso. 13 min: Goal disallowed! Chile have the ball in the net - but it\u2019s correctly chalked off. In fairness, Williams didn\u2019t play at that, so perhaps knew the whistle was coming. A clever instinctive flick, but from a player in an offside position. A warning shot though - you do get the sense that Chile are exactly the kind of nation who can conjure something from nothing if the Matildas don\u2019t take their chances today. 11 min: The experience Lara clips Carpenter, and it\u2019s another dangerous set piece opportunity for the Matildas. This time it\u2019s the left-footed Catley who fires it goalwards, but Chile scramble it clear. A very positive opening from the Matildas - there\u2019s no post-World Cup hangover/deflation still lingering over this squad. 8 min: Luik looks to release Raso - gee, she\u2019s been prominent early on. It could be a long day for Chile\u2019s left back. It\u2019s a terrific raking ball, but the Brisbane Roar flyer is caught slightly on her heels and can\u2019t keep it in. 6 min: Raso looks to skip down the touchline - she thinks she\u2019s earned a corner but no dice. No VAR in this game by the way - relief as that may come to many fans. Otherwise we\u2019d be debating whether Kerr\u2019s early effort should have been wiped out for any potential microfoul/transgression in the buildup. 3 min: EArly set-piece opportunity as Raso in brought down in a dangerous area. Van Egmond clips to the far post and Chile fail to clear their lines. It falls to Kerr in the box, can you believe that - and the sharp shooter makes no mistake! It\u2019s a rifled effort low, and into the bottom left corner - Endler with no chance! 29 goals in her last 31 Matildas appearances. This incredible and prodigious goalscorer continues to deliver. Wow. 1 min: It\u2019s Australia getting us underway with a direct play forward, looking to put Chile immediately under pressure. Early possession is with the Matildas as they look to pass it around but Chile avert the danger. The skippers Kerr and Endler exchange pendants - which means kickoff can\u2019t be too far away! The Matildas going through a very quick second warm up after that sombre commemorative lead in. A more sombre moment as part of Remembrance weekend commemorations. The reading of the Ode, the playing of the Last Post. Rituals very connected with the historic role the armed services have played in Australia, in the two world wars and conflicts since then. Our players have headed out onto the pitch, in splendid Sydney sunshine. A few messages in the crowd to the people of Chile, who have been embroiled in not insignificant protests lately. Nice to see a fair presence from South American expats adding colour and passion to the spectacle. But both anthems are impeccably observed. The debutant McCormick looks like her heart was going to leap out of her chest - what a moment - your international debut for Australia. So without ado, to team news: It\u2019s effectively a full-strength available line up for the Matildas, and there is a starting debut for Jenna McCormick in the heart of defence - what a big day for the South Australian. The veteran Aivi Luik will anchor the midfield in the absence of Kellond-Knight, while Hayley Raso gets the nod ahead of Bayern Munich\u2019s Emily Gielnik up front. Australia: Williams (GK); Carpenter, McCormick, Polkinghorne, Catley; Luik, Van Egmond, Logarzo; Raso, Kerr (c), Foord For Chile, Paris Saint Germain\u2019s \u2018keeper, and their skipper returns between the sticks for a side that\u2019s turned a little to youth - watch out for the experience Sevilla duo Lara and Aedo to worry the Matildas: There are a few faces missing from the Matildas squad - most notably, the 150+ capped Lisa De Vanna. Coach Ante Milicic has been at pains to say the veteran hasn\u2019t been retired and remains in contention for the Olympics squad - pointing out that Kyah Simon and Mary Fowler are also missing from this series - but you do wonder if this is the end for one of Australia\u2019s all-time greats. I had the immense pleasure of sitting down with Lisa pre-World Cup, and she\u2019s definitely a no-nonsense, straight shooter. Great to hear though that she\u2019s thinking of possibly doing some coaching - it would be brilliant to retain somebody of her experience in women\u2019s football in Australia. There\u2019s also no Elise Kellond-Knight, who has elected to remain in Brisbane to work on her fitness ahead of her return back home to Queensland with the Brisbane Roar. But there are two uncapped players in the squad - Emma Checker and Jenna McCormick come in to provide much-needed coverage at centre back, where Alanna Kennedy is suspended, following her World Cup red card against Norway. Afternoon all! I hope this finds you well from around the world, wherever you\u2019re following our coverage. A big g\u2019day to our North American audience who love their WoSo, and where there will no doubt be plenty of key observers following the NWSL MVP and lead-goalscorer, Sam Kerr, and plenty more in store. If you want to get in touch, shoot us an email or tweet to join the coverage - we\u2019d love to hear your thoughts about this one. The road to Tokyo 2020 Olympics starts in one of Australia\u2019s newest cauldrons of football, as the Matildas come together for the first time since the France World Cup, in front no doubt of an expectant, boisterous and appreciative home crowd in Sydney\u2019s Parramatta. On paper it\u2019s World No 8 plays World No 37, as visitors Chile return to Australia, but as last year\u2019s two-match series showed take those rankings with some salt, given the lack of support women\u2019s football has had in Conmebol over recent years. It will be no accurate reflector of the individual talent in the squad of South America\u2019s third-best nation. Last series Chile stunned Alen Stajcic\u2019s Matildas with a first-up 3-2 win that almost jeopardised the Matildas\u2019 World Cup pool ranking; a 5-0 second leg saw some redress that in Newcastle. Which Chile will we see today? Hard to say - probably somewhere in between? But for many fans it will be just about seeing their own heroes before their eyes. Sam Kerr and co are back, and we should be in for a treat.",

      "bodyText": "Fiye on Shaun What were you hoping for? To connect with someone, have a laugh and not spill any food down my white T. First impressions? Nice hair, very warm and engaging. What did you talk about? Work, how sweaty and hot we both get, Twitter, gym routines, being \u201cwoke\u201d and the countryside. Any awkward moments? None that I can remember. Good table manners? Yes. Although we used our hands for certain dishes. Best thing about Shaun? He is very comfortable in his own skin and beams positivity. Would you introduce him to your friends? Yeah, sure. Describe Shaun in three words Passionate, confident, friendly. What do you think he made of you? Very smiley and talkative. Did you go on somewhere? To a local pub for a couple. And... did you kiss? No. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I would change the seats, as they were uncomfortable for a long period of time. Marks out of 10? 7. Would you meet again?

      "body": "<p>I arrived at the pub early and sent out an email: \u201cI\u2019m the girl in the white shirt and red lipstick!\u201d Not long after that, a young woman, nervous and looking a little lost, appeared and asked: \u201cAre you Rachel?\u201d At first, the conversation was a little stilted, but it began to flow as we got on to common ground.</p> <p>If this sounds like a blind date, it wasn\u2019t far off \u2013 except we weren\u2019t searching for romance, and she wasn\u2019t the only person looking for me. She was, in fact, the first of many to arrive that evening, and what had brought us all together was death, not romance. We were bereaved millennials who had lost someone close and discovered how little grief support exists for people our age.</p> <p>My search for support groups for young people began at my mother\u2019s suggestion, a few weeks before she died, aged 63, in April last year. I found nothing that resembled what I was looking for. Traditional support groups appeared abundantly available, but when I thought about sitting in a room full of older people who had had their parents for longer \u2013 present for life milestones that my mother would never experience \u2013 I felt isolated and resentful.</p> <p>\u201cMillennial grief\u201d is, of course, an imperfect catch-all term; people have always experienced grief in early adulthood, and it can be devastating regardless of your age and generation. But the trend in recent decades has been for women to become mothers later in life, which means that millennials are more likely to have ageing parents than previous generations \u2013 and to lose them when they are young.</p> <p>And, thanks to the political, social and economic instability of the past decade, we are the first generation to be worse off than our parents, and so tend to be emotionally and financially dependent on them for longer. All this uncertainty can make losing a parent even more bewildering.</p> <p>My mother was a nurse. When I was young, she taught me how to fold my bedsheets into firm, neat hospital corners at the end of my bed. I never expected that I would be using her lesson, at 25, to make her comfortable on the pressure-relief mattress that would soon become her deathbed.</p> <p>She had been diagnosed with cancer nearly a year before. One evening, my father rang my brother and me and told us to come home immediately; it could be a matter of days. In the end, we had exactly two weeks. In one of the heart-rending conversations we had, days before her death, my mother shook her head and tutted: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed. You should have had me for another 30 years.\u201d</p> <p>I wondered how I would cope with all that time without her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc598cc60b9790aab1a3059412e0745ae918f902\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc598cc60b9790aab1a3059412e0745ae918f902/0_267_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Wilson as a toddler with her mother.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilson as a toddler with her mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Rachel Wilson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the time of her diagnosis, my life was unstable. I had had a string of entry-level jobs, a failed three-year relationship and was midway through a master\u2019s I hoped would set me on a more solid career path. I still looked to my parents for support to some extent, and that fact made me feel like a failure. Mixed with this lack of direction, my grief led me to conclude, objectively, that the rest of my life wasn\u2019t worth living.</p> <p>Julia Samuel, author of Grief Works and co-founder of Child Bereavement UK, tells me what is particular about bereavement in emerging adulthood. \u201cThe thing about grief is, it throws you into a completely alien landscape,\u201d she says. \u201cSo if you feel uncertain already, it heightens that feeling of, \u2018I don\u2019t know where I am, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going. I don\u2019t even know <em>who</em> I am. My birth certificate says I\u2019m an adult, but I don\u2019t feel like one.\u2019 At 25, you wanted more of your mum to help see you through, to when you could really feel grown up.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly, the loss of my mother was like losing my North Star. \u201cThe death of your mum was a death out of time,\u201d Samuel says. \u201cYou felt robbed, but you also felt robbed of a future you felt you and she had a right to. All the images of her you had in your life \u2013 at your wedding, the birth of your baby \u2013 were lost. So, if you\u2019re in a group of 50-year-old women whose mothers have died, for example, you would think: well, screw you. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re crying about. You got 30 years more than me.\u201d</p> <p>When my search for a support group reached a dead end, I decided to write to one of my favourite podcasts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/09/the-high-low-posh-podcasters-who-make-themselves-shiver-with-shame\" title=\"t\">The High Low</a>, the current affairs show hosted by journalists Pandora Sykes and Dolly Alderton. I asked if other listeners had experienced loss and whether they knew of any resources for young people. The episode featuring my letter was broadcast on the day of my mother\u2019s funeral. The next morning, I was forwarded a deluge of responses. The first email read: \u201cWhen I heard your episode, I nearly crashed my car.\u201d A second: \u201cI burst into tears on the tube. Everything she said completely resonated with me.\u201d I had struck a wellspring of young grief.</p> <p>If millennial grief is under-supported, then here was a millennial way of filling that gap \u2013 using a podcast to connect. In the following days, I read the responses compulsively. Most people reiterated my feeling that there was little out there tailored to our age group, and that many of us felt the same intense isolation. Scrolling through the missives, I felt a sense of release for the first time in over a year. Even more remarkably, I felt the first glimmers of reassurance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd6a81d3e7312625ad4648cb0b0b1bd7568eb0e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd6a81d3e7312625ad4648cb0b0b1bd7568eb0e8/0_276_6820_4092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Wilson (second left) at a Grief Network meeting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilson (second left) at a Grief Network meeting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matilda Hill-Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I started meeting those other listeners a month after my mother died.

I was recognised and I was heard.</p> <p>Realising the benefit of these meetings, I arranged that first group meet-up in the pub. There, the challenges we were facing as young people became apparent: getting through your first break-up without your mother to comfort you; struggling to assert your need for time off work after your father had taken his life (in one case); having to make funeral arrangements and pay household bills as you grieve.

      "bodyText": "I arrived at the pub early and sent out an email: \u201cI\u2019m the girl in the white shirt and red lipstick!\u201d Not long after that, a young woman, nervous and looking a little lost, appeared and asked: \u201cAre you Rachel?\u201d At first, the conversation was a little stilted, but it began to flow as we got on to common ground. If this sounds like a blind date, it wasn\u2019t far off \u2013 except we weren\u2019t searching for romance, and she wasn\u2019t the only person looking for me. She was, in fact, the first of many to arrive that evening, and what had brought us all together was death, not romance. We were bereaved millennials who had lost someone close and discovered how little grief support exists for people our age. My search for support groups for young people began at my mother\u2019s suggestion, a few weeks before she died, aged 63, in April last year. I found nothing that resembled what I was looking for. Traditional support groups appeared abundantly available, but when I thought about sitting in a room full of older people who had had their parents for longer \u2013 present for life milestones that my mother would never experience \u2013 I felt isolated and resentful. \u201cMillennial grief\u201d is, of course, an imperfect catch-all term; people have always experienced grief in early adulthood, and it can be devastating regardless of your age and generation. But the trend in recent decades has been for women to become mothers later in life, which means that millennials are more likely to have ageing parents than previous generations \u2013 and to lose them when they are young. And, thanks to the political, social and economic instability of the past decade, we are the first generation to be worse off than our parents, and so tend to be emotionally and financially dependent on them for longer. All this uncertainty can make losing a parent even more bewildering. My mother was a nurse. When I was young, she taught me how to fold my bedsheets into firm, neat hospital corners at the end of my bed. I never expected that I would be using her lesson, at 25, to make her comfortable on the pressure-relief mattress that would soon become her deathbed. She had been diagnosed with cancer nearly a year before. One evening, my father rang my brother and me and told us to come home immediately; it could be a matter of days. In the end, we had exactly two weeks. In one of the heart-rending conversations we had, days before her death, my mother shook her head and tutted: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed. You should have had me for another 30 years.\u201d I wondered how I would cope with all that time without her. At the time of her diagnosis, my life was unstable. I had had a string of entry-level jobs, a failed three-year relationship and was midway through a master\u2019s I hoped would set me on a more solid career path. I still looked to my parents for support to some extent, and that fact made me feel like a failure. Mixed with this lack of direction, my grief led me to conclude, objectively, that the rest of my life wasn\u2019t worth living. Julia Samuel, author of Grief Works and co-founder of Child Bereavement UK, tells me what is particular about bereavement in emerging adulthood. \u201cThe thing about grief is, it throws you into a completely alien landscape,\u201d she says. \u201cSo if you feel uncertain already, it heightens that feeling of, \u2018I don\u2019t know where I am, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going.

Fiona Douglas from Leeds School of English, who is leading the project, said the net would be cast wider this time round. \u201cI\u2019m not just going out looking for old men with good teeth who haven\u2019t moved anywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will speak to people whose families haven\u2019t stayed in one area for generations, as well as those who can trace their roots back to the same place over hundreds of years. We want to include everyone\u2019s language.\u201d The lottery money will also allow the digitisation of notebooks, photographs, word maps and audio recordings from the original fieldwork. The extensive Leeds Archive of Vernacular Culture (LAVC) will be opened to the public. Researchers are keen also to speak to descendants of people who took part in the original surveys. Douglas said she had already tracked down three of the fieldworkers who travelled the country, first with notebooks and later with cumbersome reel-to-reel audio recorders that were sometimes hooked up to car batteries because of a lack of mains electricity. Others to come forward include the children and grandchildren of original respondents. Some remember Werner Kissling, an ethnographic photographer who worked for the project in the 1960s and captured Wensleydale kids playing \u201cwallops\u201d \u2013 a variant of skittles \u2013 in the road. \u201cI\u2019ve heard tell of fieldwork done in fishing boats in the middle of the night and dialect caravans touring the country,\u201d Douglas said. The original surveyors picked up a wealth of data. As well as \u201cgibble-fisted\u201d for left-handed, they discovered cack-handed, cat-handed, coochy-pawed, left-kaggy and squippy. Freckles were called ferntickles, murfles, brannyspreckles, brunny-spots, vrackles and frantittles. A packed lunch might have been bait, jock or snap. Douglas said dialect was a way of looking in at a window to the past. \u201cSometimes people feel embarrassed saying \u2018oh it\u2019s slang\u2019. When you say to somebody, it\u2019s not, and it\u2019s got a really long, distinguished and historical pedigree, suddenly you get people with this sense of empowerment.\u201d",

Diamond and Silk, social media personalities and Fox Nation hosts are escorted to the front of the line and pass through security with Herman Cain, who Trump announced he was recommending for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board earlier this year before Cain withdrew his name for consideration. Cain, a former pizza exec, briefly ran for the 2012 Republican Presidential nomination but dropped out after sexual harassment allegations came to light.

      "bodyText": "Quiet ending to a not-so-quiet day. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg appears to have officially entered the 2020 Democratic presidential fray, but has made no formal announcement. Lawyers for Donald Trump plan on going to the Supreme Court over an appeals court ruling that his accounting firm must hand over eight years of his tax returns to New York state prosecutors. Yet another aide for billionaire and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Tom Steyer has resigned over misconduct allegations. The team behind Michael Bloomberg has said that \u201cif we run\u201d, they would bypass the four early-voting state - Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina - and focus on doing well on Super Tuesday and beyond. Though he has not officially announced yet , he\u2019s already getting flack for his decision to ignore the early states. Billionaire and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Tom Steyer has had some questionable happenings in his campaign recently. A South Carolina aide stole volunteer data from Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign, and later resigned. And now this: Lawyers for Donald Trump say they\u2019ll be going to the supreme court over the matter of New York state prosecutors obtaining his tax records, the Associated Press is reporting. A US appeals court ruled on Monday that Trump\u2019s accounting firm must hand over eight years of his tax returns to New York prosecutors. In a letter to the US district Judge Victor Marrero on Friday, Trump\u2019s lawyers and the state prosecutor said that they can fully brief the matter no later than 25 November if the high court agrees to review rulings against Trump by Marrero and an appeals court. That would allow the supreme court to decide the case in its current term. Michael Bloomberg is officially on the ballot in Michigan too, but still no announcement. Seriously, how hard is it to toss a tweet up announcing your run? So...are we going to get that official campaign announcement, or....? Just under the wire for Michael Bloomberg: Who here remembers Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, who was the chief White House physician that Donald Trump nominated for secretary of veterans affairs in 2018? That\u2019s right, the doctor who withdrew his nomination following accusations that he once got so drunk that he wrecked a government vehicle and handed out so many prescription drugs that he was nicknamed \u201ccandyman\u201d? (He denied all the allegations). Well, it looks like Jackson is now considering a run for Congress. According to Roll Call, Jackson, a Republican and a native Texan, is eyeing the 13th District, now open after Congressman Mac Thornberry announced his retirement. Hi all, Vivian Ho on the west coast, taking over the blog for the rest of the day. Let\u2019s try not to get into any trouble. It\u2019s been an eventful Friday afternoon \u2013 here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s been happening: The transcripts of two diplomats and witnesses to the Ukraine scandal, Fiona Hill and Lt Col Alexander Vindman, were released today. Mick Mulvaney was largely implicated in both for being a key agent in withholding Ukraine\u2019s aid. Trump said that he is considering taking up an invitation from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to attend a Russian military parade in May. He also called Michael Bloomberg \u201cLittle Michael\u201d and said he\u2019s not worried about the billionaire entering the race. House Republicans appointed Jim Jordan, a Republican representative from Ohio, to the House intelligence committee. Jordan\u2019s new spot will allow him to grill witnesses as public impeachment hearings are set to begin next week. A lawyer for the former US national security adviser John Bolton said there are more Trump-Ukraine-related meetings and conversations that Congress does not know about, according to a report from the New York Times. Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, testified against Trump ally Roger Stone in court today. Bannon said that Stone was the \u201caxis\u201d between the Trump campaign and Wikileaks. Ben Carson: It takes \u201ca lot of courage\u201d to be a Trump supporter At the Black Voices for Trump coalition rally in Atlanta this afternoon, Housing and Urban Development secretary Ben Carson warmed up the crowd by thanking the crowd for their \u201ccourage\u201d. \u201cIn our society today, it takes a lot of courage to say that you\u2019re supporting President Trump.\u201d he said. The kind of \u201cmanipulation\u201d and \u201cintimidation\u201d that comes with being a Trump supporter, he said, has been going on \u201csince we\u2019ve been in America\u201d, citing slavery and Jim Crow laws. Side note: In 2016, 8% of black Americans voted for Trump, compared to 89% who voted for Hillary Clinton. He predicted that he would win 95 percent of the black vote. Bloomberg has a 5pm deadline today to file for the Democratic presidential primary in Alabama, but he (and presumably his staff) have yet to be seen. *eyes emoji* Forbes released an estimate of the net worth of the Trump siblings using property records, court documents and government filings. Ivanka reigns on top, in part thanks to her marriage to Jared Kushner. Her wealth is estimated to be $375m. Don Jr. and Eric are estimated to be worth about $25m each. Tiffany, 26, and Barron, 13, have yet to inherit much from their father. Their older siblings have gotten most of their cash by serving as executives at the Trump Organization. Ivanka\u2019s serving as vice president of the organization got her $25m. Her now-defunct fashion line, at its peak, got her $10 million a year at the height of its popularity. All Melania has gotten is \u201ca small Trump Tower apartment\u2026 worth $1.5m\u201d. Womp womp. Biden on Bloomberg: I welcome him in the race Former vice president and presidential candidate Joe Biden said that he welcomes former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg into the race. Bloomberg\u2019s still-unofficial entry into the Democratic primary has been seen as a sign the billionaire believes Biden won\u2019t be able to muster a promising campaign against progressive Democrats. Earlier in the year, there had been whispers that Bloomberg was gearing up for a race but was carefully watching Biden\u2019s moves to see if he would run. He announced in March that he would not be seeking the Democratic candidacy, a month before Biden launched his campaign April. Just... wow Students hold rally in DC in support of DACA Students in Washington D.C. led protests in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The program, implemented under the Obama administration but rescinded under the Trump administration, offers those who were brought to the US as undocumented children legal protections that allow them to stay in the country. About 660,00 people are \u201cDreamers\u201d, the nickname for DACA recipients. Next week, the Supreme Court will decide whether the Trump administration\u2019s cut of DACA is constitutional. Two lower courts in California, New York and D.C. found that the administration violated something called the \u201cAdministrative Procedure Act\u201d by killing the act. \u201cWe are more than number. We are people with families, communities, and dreams,\u201d said one student at a protest in Washington. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is currently testifying against Roger Stone, a political operative and ally of Trump, in court. Stone is accused of lying to the House intelligence committee about the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to obtain incriminating emails hacked by Russia and published by Wikileaks to harm Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky announced that Bannon would be a surprise witness in the trial earlier this week. \u201cStone regularly updated people on the Trump campaign at the senior levels about whatever information he thought he had about WikiLeaks,\u201d Zelinsky said, adding that he went directly to Bannon with the info. Stone has pleaded not guilty to charges of obstructing justice, witness tampering and lying to the committee. According to Politico\u2019s Darren Samuelsohn, who is live-tweeting the trial, Bannon said that Stone told him prior to joining the campaign that he had a relationship with Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange. After he joined the campaign, Stone continued to tell him about his ties to Wikileaks. He confirmed that the campaign viewed Stone as an \u201caxis point\u201d to WikiLeaks. A lawyer for John Bolton, former US national security adviser, wrote a letter to lawmakers that there are \u201cmany relevant meetings and conversations\u201d related to the administration\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine that House impeachment investigators don\u2019t know about, according to the New York Times. Bolton was scheduled for a deposition in front of the House impeachment committees yesterday but, like many of his White House peers, did not appear. Charles Cooper, Bolton\u2019s lawyer and author of the letter, said that Bolton was involved in not only meetings and discussions that have been revealed through existing testimony, but \u201cmany relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.\u201d Bolton is waiting for a judge to rule on whether he and his former deputy, Charles Kupperman, can defy White House orders not to testify. House Republicans have appointed US congressman Jim Jordan, a Republican representative from Ohio, to the House intelligence committee. Republicans are gearing up a line of defense as impeachment hearings are set to begin next week. Jordan has been a vocal critic of the impeachment inquiry, called the investigations a \u201csham\u201d. He is currently the top Republican on the House oversight committee, one of the committees that oversees the inquiry, but will be able to ask witnesses questions as part of his new committee. Trump supporters gather for rally in Atlanta Quick break from impeachment coverage. Trump is slated to speak at a rally in Atlanta for the new Black Voice for Trump coalition. The president is expected to speak at 3pm, and supporters have already gathered in anticipation. Here\u2019s more from Khushbu Shah, who\u2019s at the rally in Atlanta: The path leading up to the Black Voices for Trump launch is lined with police (and more police) and security, but not a single protester is to be found. However, waiting to enter a conference room in the back of the the Georgia World Congress Center are Trump supporters. Some are wearing the ubiquitous MAGA hats seen at any Trump event, a few in couple cowboy hats, and some in Black Voters for Trump shirts. Diamond and Silk, social media personalities and Fox Nation hosts are escorted to the front of the line and pass through security with Herman Cain, who Trump announced he was recommending for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board earlier this year before Cain withdrew his name for consideration. Cain, a former pizza exec, briefly ran for the 2012 Republican Presidential nomination but dropped out after sexual harassment allegations came to light. The room where Trump will speak looks to fit a couple hundred people. CL Bryant, who has come down from DC for the day, is an African-American Baptist minister who estimates 400 people might fit in the room, though it looks much smaller. Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney approved a White House meeting for the Ukrainian president \u2013 if Ukraine announced investigations tied to Joe Biden, a political rival of Donald Trump, according to testimony unveiled on Friday by the congressional committees pursuing an impeachment inquiry. Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, \u201cblurted out\u201d that Mulvaney had approved the meeting if the Ukrainians announced an investigation of Burisma, a gas company that formerly employed Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son, said Fiona Hill, a national security council member who was deposed by the committees last month. Hill\u2019s account was corroborated by simultaneously released testimony by another firsthand witness to the conversation, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. While previously released testimony has indicated a central role for Mulvaney in brokering an agreement in which Ukraine would intervene in the 2020 US election by announcing the Burisma investigation, the testimony released Friday was the first to describe direct involvement in the plot by the acting chief of staff. Hill described for investigators a 10 July meeting attended by herself, Sondland, nationals security adviser John Bolton, Ukrainian officials and others. Hill testified: \u201cThen Ambassador Sondland blurted out: \u2018Well, we have an agreement with the chief of staff for a meeting if these investigations in the energy sector start.\u2019 \u2026And Ambassador Bolton immediately stiffened and ended the meeting.\u201d Vindman gave a similar account of the meeting. \u201cI heard him say that this had been coordinated with White House Chief of Staff Mr. Mick Mulvaney,\u201d Vindman said. Here\u2019s what happened when House Republicans stormed the room when Fiona Hill was testifying, according to the transcript The House committees released highlights of key passages in the transcripts (which combined are 786 pages long). Here is the top highlight from Fiona Hill, former aide to national security adviser John Bolton: \u201cI went back to talk to Ambassador Bolton. And Ambassador Bolton asked me to go over and report this to our NSC counsel, to John Eisenberg. And he told me, and this is a direct quote from Ambassador Bolton: You go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this, and you go and tell him what you\u2019ve heard and what I\u2019ve said. So I went over to talk to John Eisenberg about this. \u2026 I told him exactly, you know, what had transpired and that Ambassador Sondland had basically indicated that there was agreement with the chief of staff that they would have a White House meeting or, you know, a Presidential meeting if the Ukrainians started up these investigations again. And the main thing that I was personally concerned about, as I said to John, was that he did this in front of the Ukrainians.\u201d Find more of Hill\u2019s testimony highlights here. And here is the top highlight from Lt Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council: Q: All right. So you did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen. You used the word \u201cdemand,\u201d it was not proper to demand. Where in the transcript do you believe that the President made a demand to investigate a U.S. citizen? A: So, Congressman, the power disparity between the President of the United States and the President of Ukraine is vast, and, you know, in the President asking for something, it became\u2014there was\u2014in return for a White House meeting, because that\u2019s what this was about. This was about getting a White House meeting. It was a demand for him to fulfill his\u2014fulfill this particular prerequisite in order to get the meeting Find more of Vindman\u2019s testimony highlights here. The House impeachment committees have just released a transcript of the deposition of Fiona Hill, a former aide to US national security adviser John Bolton, and Lt Col Alexander S Vindman\u2019s, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council. Previous reports of her testimony, which lasted 10 hours, said Hill claims Bolton was alarmed by the back-channel efforts to pressure Ukraine. Vindman reportedly expressed concerns in his testimony that the president and his allies were trying to enlish Ukraine into a campaign to smear political rivals. Read Hill\u2019s transcript here and Vindman\u2019s here. We\u2019re going through it now. Actress and activist Jane Fonda was back on Capitol Hill today for her weekly climate crisis protest Fire Drill Fridays (the \u201cGrannies unite\u201d version of the student-led climate strikes). Fonda has been arrested multiple times over the last few weeks for her Friday protests in Washington. Here\u2019s something to keep in mind re: Republicans and the impeachment inquiry: An economist who has vouched for US senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren\u2019s $20.5 trillion healthcare plan has expressed skepticism about the plan\u2019s wealth tax revision. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told Reuters that while he agrees with the calculations behind Warren\u2019s plan, he doesn\u2019t believe the wealth tax will achieve the projected amount needed. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to believe billionaires are going to use every resource to avoid paying the tax,\u201d Zandi said, though he added that Warren may be able to compensate the difference through other tax measures, like a tax on corporations and employers. At a campaign stop in North Carolina yesterday, Warren was asked to respond to criticism that her Medicare for All plan is a pipe dream. \u201cYou don\u2019t get what you don\u2019t fight for,\u201d she said. Referee says US Rep knew about sexual assault allegations against sports doctor Picking up momentum on politics Twitter this morning: An anonymous professional referee alleged in a lawsuit filed yesterday that he told US Congressman Jim Jordan that Richard Strauss, the now-dead Ohio State University sports team physician, masturbated in front of him in a shower in 1994, NBC reported last night. Jordan replied, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s Strauss,\u201d according to the lawsuit. More than 100 former students have accused Strauss of sexual misconduct, according to an investigation that was revealed this summer. Other ex-athletes in July accused Jordan of ignoring the alleged abuses. Jordan, a high-ranking Republican and one of Trump\u2019s top defenders in the impeachment inquiry, was a former assistant coach of the wrestling team at the university. Jordan has denied that he knew, and implicitly overlooked, allegations against the doctor. \u201cI never knew about any type of abuse. If I did, I would have done something about it,\u201d he told Politico in July. Besides saying that he is considering going to a Russia military parade in May (!), Trump answered a bunch of other questions near the White House just moments ago ranging from Ukraine to Michael Bloomberg. Here\u2019s some bits via pool reports: On Gordon Sondland: \u201cI hardly knew the gentleman.\u201d (Note: the gentleman donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s campaign ahead of his inauguration) On the transcript of an earlier call he had with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky: \u201cI will give it if they want it.\u201d He added that the call was good, but releasing the transcript would set a \u201cbad precedent\u201d. On a complete rollback on tariffs against China: \u201cI won\u2019t do it.\u201d On Bloomberg entering the Democratic primary: \u201cHe\u2019s not going to do well, but I think he\u2019s going to hurt Biden actually. \u2026 There\u2019s nobody I\u2019d rather run against than little Michael.\u201d \u201cLittle Michael\u201d, huh? The president just told pool reporters on the White House lawn that Russian president Vladimir Putin invited him to the Russian military parade in May and he is considering attending. Trump at one point admitted that Russia helped elect him as president, though he quickly backtracked on that statement. \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia!\u201d he once tweeted in May in a fury Tweetstorm in the wake of the release of the special counsel\u2019s report. Robert Mueller said in public remarks that his investigation established that the \u201cRussian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome.\u201d It\u2019s no wonder Putin invited him to the parade... Andrew Yang on Michael Bloomberg joining the primary... Ivanka Trump: Identity of whistleblower is not \u201csubstantive part of conversation\u201d Ivanka Trump spoke to the AP earlier this morning in her first interview since the impeachment inquiry began. She gave the usual talking points delivered by her father and his allies: Read the transcript, the impeachment investigation is an attempt to overturn the 2016 election, \u201cAmericans are prospering like never before\u201d, etc. But one thing she said did stick out: \u201cI don\u2019t view the whistleblower as... it shouldn\u2019t be a substantive part of the conversation because this is a third-party who was not privy to the call and did not have firsthand information.\u201d In a stark comparison, the president and his allies have attacked the whistleblower\u2019s anonymity. At a rally in Kentucky earlier this week, Republican senator Rand Paul told media outlets to \u201cdo your job and print his name\u201d as Trump stood behind him, smiling and clapping. Experts say the aggressive strategy of public attacking whistleblowers is risky and can potentially damage the whistleblower system that is meant to keep power in check. An NBC reporter said on Twitter that the House impeachment committees are expected to release transcripts of Fiona Hill and Lt Col Alexander S Vindman\u2019s testimonies today. Hill, a former aide to US national security adviser John Bolton (who was a no-show himself at a schedule deposition yesterday), spoke to the committees for 10 hours last month. Reports of her testimony claim that Hill told them that her former boss was so alarmed by the back-channel efforts to pressure Ukraine, he told a senior aide to report it to White House lawyers. Vindman, a US army lieutenant colonel and the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, reportedly expressed concerns in his testimony that the president and his allies were trying to enlist Ukraine into a campaign to smear political rivals. Happy Friday, and welcome to the politics live blog! This busy week in the impeachment investigations is coming to a close with a sizzle. Last night, the House committees in charge of the impeachment inquiry subpoenaed acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to testify this morning at 9am. Like a handful of White House officials deposed by the committees, Mulvaney will likely be a no-show. Mulvaney admitted during a press conference last month that he withheld $400m of aid to pressure Ukraine. Though he has walked back on his statement, officials who have already testified in front of the House impeachment committees have indicated Mulavaney withheld the aid. That the House committees subpoenaed Mulvaney hints that they are ready to take the impeachment inquiry public next week, a plan they announced Wednesday. Here\u2019s what else is happening in the world of politics today: An interview with Ivanka Trump by the AP was released this morning. The eldest Trump daughter said that while she believes the impeachment inquiry is an attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election, she said the identity of the whistleblower is \u201cnot particularly relevant\u201d, parting ways with her father and his closest allies who have demanded the media to reveal the identity of the anonymous whistleblower. The Elder Trump is heading to Georgia today for a rally to kick off the Black Voices for Trump coalition after he attends a high-dollar fundraiser for a Georgia Repbulican senator. The House is prepared to start the process of revising the Equal Rights Amendment to allow Virginia to ratify the amendment after the state\u2019s legislature turned blue earlier this week. An amendment needs ratification from 38 states to become a part of the Constitution. Virginia would be the 38th state to ratify the amendment, which bars discrimination on the basis of sex.",

The federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, and state and territory environment ministers signed off on the timeline, which will see the export of all of these waste materials banned by no later than 30 June 2022. Under the agreement, waste items that have not been processed into a \u201cvalue-added\u201d material \u2013 for example, items that can be used in the manufacture of other products \u2013 would be subject to the ban.

The prime minister, Scott Morrison, promised the export ban as part of a bid to tackle the amount of plastic waste ending up in the world\u2019s oceans. Compared with other developed economies, Australia generates more waste than average and recycles less. Ministers on Friday also agreed to a national waste policy, which includes a target for an 80% recovery rate of materials across all waste streams, \u201csignificant increases\u201d in government procurement of recyclable materials and halving the amount of organic waste sent to landfill. \u201cAll ministers have committed to identifying any significant procurement opportunities over coming months such as major road projects that could use significant amounts of recycled material,\u201d the ministers said in a communique on Friday.

      "body": "<p>The number of NHS patients having surgery in private hospitals has nearly trebled since 2010, sparking accusations that for-profit companies are benefitting from an \u201cenfeebled\u201d health system under the Conservatives.</p> <p>NHS figures obtained by the Guardian show that it paid for 214,967 people in England to have an operation in a private hospital in 2009-10, Labour\u2019s last year in power. The figure soared to 613,833 last year, a 185% rise in nine years.</p> <p>The figures come as NHS trusts are increasingly forced to send patients to for private surgery because they are too busy and understaffed to do the operations themselves. The sharp rise in outsourcing has coincided with <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/rtt-data-2019-20/\">the waiting-list for non-urgent operations ballooning to </a><a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/rtt-data-2019-20/\">4.6m</a>, the highest figure since records began in 2007.</p> <p>The privatisation of healthcare has emerged as a key issue in the general election campaign. Labour allege that Boris Johnson will sell large parts of the NHS to private US health firms as part of a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. The party also says the NHS\u2019s annual drugs bill could soar from \u00a318bn to \u00a345bn if US pharmaceutical firms are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/01/nhs-drugs-bill-could-soar-if-johnson-signs-trump-trade-deal-report\">given freer access to the British market</a>.

      "bodyText": "The number of NHS patients having surgery in private hospitals has nearly trebled since 2010, sparking accusations that for-profit companies are benefitting from an \u201cenfeebled\u201d health system under the Conservatives. NHS figures obtained by the Guardian show that it paid for 214,967 people in England to have an operation in a private hospital in 2009-10, Labour\u2019s last year in power. The figure soared to 613,833 last year, a 185% rise in nine years. The figures come as NHS trusts are increasingly forced to send patients to for private surgery because they are too busy and understaffed to do the operations themselves. The sharp rise in outsourcing has coincided with the waiting-list for non-urgent operations ballooning to 4.6m, the highest figure since records began in 2007. The privatisation of healthcare has emerged as a key issue in the general election campaign. Labour allege that Boris Johnson will sell large parts of the NHS to private US health firms as part of a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. The party also says the NHS\u2019s annual drugs bill could soar from \u00a318bn to \u00a345bn if US pharmaceutical firms are given freer access to the British market. The prime minister has dismissed the claims. Trusts are striking deals with independent providers to carry out surgery, including cataract removals and hip and knee replacements, and also some non-surgical treatments, including for cancer. King\u2019s College hospital trust in London, for example, sent 216 patients to BMI Healthcare in February and March, either to have surgery or undergo an endoscopy, to help cut its waiting list.
