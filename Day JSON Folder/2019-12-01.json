New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, made international headlines when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/19/new-zealand-shooting-ardern-says-she-will-never-speak-suspects-name\">refused to say the name of the man accused of the Christchurch attacks</a>.</p> <p>But his name has not been suppressed by the courts.

Those protocols don\u2019t cover his name. Each organisation will make a decision on that on their own, often on a story-by-story basis.</p> <p>These are the things that keep me up at night. My worst nightmare is reporting that creates a mistrial in one of these cases \u2013 not because of the fine that would ensue, but because victims deserve their day in court and the accused has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/08/christchurch-mayor-shooter-no-idea-name\">the right to mount their defence</a>. Seeing overseas media reporting or social media comments on these cases which bend, or outright break, the rules, is frustrating not because we\u2019ve been \u201cscooped,\u201d but because they\u2019re jeopardising a fair trial.</p> <p>When the judge lifted the suppression on the photo of the Christchurch accused, my colleagues and I went back and forth for an hour about whether to use it. It might seem like blanket rules are easy to make, but each story and each organisation is different, and there\u2019s not one right answer. We have obligations to the law, to victims, to the public, and ultimately, to the truth.</p> <p>New Zealand is a tiny country and in some ways it feels like major crimes happen to everyone. These two cases occupied the public discourse, and traumatised communities. They raise impossible questions for everyone involved. It can be hard to put emotion aside, as the judge in the Millane trial ordered jurors, and think about what constitutes a fair trial. But we all should.</p> <p><em>Megan Whelan is the head of digital content for RNZ, overseeing a team of journalists and editors reporting on New Zealand and the Pacific.</em></p>",

The mayor of Christchurch has gone so far as to claim she had \u201cno idea\u201d what the name of the accused is. The media in New Zealand have agreed to protocols on covering the Christchurch trial, which is due to begin in June. Those protocols don\u2019t cover his name. Each organisation will make a decision on that on their own, often on a story-by-story basis. These are the things that keep me up at night. My worst nightmare is reporting that creates a mistrial in one of these cases \u2013 not because of the fine that would ensue, but because victims deserve their day in court and the accused has the right to mount their defence. Seeing overseas media reporting or social media comments on these cases which bend, or outright break, the rules, is frustrating not because we\u2019ve been \u201cscooped,\u201d but because they\u2019re jeopardising a fair trial. When the judge lifted the suppression on the photo of the Christchurch accused, my colleagues and I went back and forth for an hour about whether to use it. It might seem like blanket rules are easy to make, but each story and each organisation is different, and there\u2019s not one right answer. We have obligations to the law, to victims, to the public, and ultimately, to the truth. New Zealand is a tiny country and in some ways it feels like major crimes happen to everyone. These two cases occupied the public discourse, and traumatised communities. They raise impossible questions for everyone involved. It can be hard to put emotion aside, as the judge in the Millane trial ordered jurors, and think about what constitutes a fair trial. But we all should.

But as well as offering encouraging noises about a recall for Tottenham\u2019s Dele Alli after three goals in two appearances for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, he insisted the door also remains open to the Manchester City defender Kyle Walker despite the proliferation of options in that position. \u201cWith Kyle, we\u2019ve obviously got [Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s] Kieran Trippier, who I was watching his game this morning against Juve,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he\u2019s been playing very well. Trent Alexander-Arnold is obviously playing well but Kyle is right in that mix. Chelsea\u2019s Reece James is also coming through and is another one that is pushing in that area of the pitch. So we have competition but it would be foolish to rule Kyle out.\u201d",

You can read a summary of the day\u2019s political events here and our news story from the debate here. Andrew Sparrow will be back tomorrow to guide you through developments on the campaign trail. Good night. More from Nazia Parveen backstage in Salford, where she has been talking to politicians sent out to bat for their teams \u2013 Lisa Smart, Hazel Grove candidate for the Liberal Democrats said: viewers would have been \u201cappalled\u201d by Farage defending Trump\u2019s \u201cdeeply misogynistic\u201d comments. \u201cThe British public deserve better than what they saw from Farage, who let\u2019s not forget is Boris Johnson\u2019s cheerleader. The only way to stand up for liberal values, stop Boris and stop Brexit at this election is to vote Liberal Democrat,\u201d she added. Green party co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, speaking backstage said that it was frustrating to see the main parties failing to discuss climate change as part of the debate. \u201cIt should have been a central component but nobody seemed to take the lead on it. Sian (Berry) had to keep raising it and she did really well with that but it was very disappointing to see something so important being pushed aside.\u201d Business minister Kwasi Kwarteng defended the prime minister\u2019s decision not to attend the debate saying that he was busy dealing with the terror incident. \u201cI am not his campaign manager but he has been dealing with the terror incident since Friday and he is busy doing that at the moment,\u201d he added. Here is our story from tonight\u2019s seven-way televised debate. Opposition leaders attacked Boris Johnson for his closeness to Donald Trump on the eve of the US president\u2019s visit to the UK for a Nato summit, reports deputy political editor Rowena Mason. Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, Greens and Plaid Cymru all expressed concern about the prime minister\u2019s relationship with Trump, with Nicola Sturgeon saying he should \u201csup with a very long spoon\u201d in dealing with him. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, was applauded for a speech condemning Trump for his comments on women and religious minorities, while Richard Burgon, Labour\u2019s shadow justice secretary, accused Trump and Johnson of \u201cconspiring\u201d together. You can read the full story here: Guardian north of England correspondent, Nazia Parveen, reports from Salford: Following the debate Dr David Bull MEP from the Brexit Party said he did not agree with Nigel Farage when, during one of the most memorable moments of the debate, he said \u201cmen say dreadful things sometimes\u201d in reference to sexist comments by Donald Trump. Bull said: \u201cHe is allowed to have his own opinion. However, I don\u2019t condone it or agree with it because I believe that everyone should be treated with respect. It was an ill-advised comment.\u201d Meanwhile Delyth Jewell from Plaid Cymru said Farage\u2019s comments had illustrated that he was unfit for public office. She said: \u201cFarage\u2019s mask well and truly slipped. Shame on him. That moment made clear how lacking in morals he is and how unfit for public life he is.\u201d Here\u2019s a reminder of one of the moments in the debate that is likely to be best remembered, in which Nigel Farage said \u201cmen say bad things sometimes\u201d in reference to sexist comments by Donald Trump. They are asked to give their final statements. Farage says that he hopes that the audience has enjoyed the talent show. He\u2019s failed at being the most politically correct candidate, which hasn\u2019t impressed people in the studio, but might have impressed people at home, he says. Sunak says the choice is between Boris Johnson getting Brexit done by the end of January or Corbyn staying neutral and having more referenda. Burgon says that a Labour government would \u201csupport you and invest in your community\u201d. \u201cWe are on your side,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are for the many, not the few\u201d. Price says that education was his route out of poverty. There are children in Wales that are going to school hungry. Putting faith in Westminster parties allows the cycle of poverty to continue. Berry says that Greens don\u2019t fear the future, they are the future. You can trust us to tell the truth and hold government to account, she says. \u201cVote Green. If not now, when?\u201d Swinson says that \u201cget Brexit done\u201d is just Johnson\u2019s latest lie. The Lib Dems are the only party that can stop Boris Johnson, she says. Sturgeon says that Johnson\u2019s Tories are unfit for office, but unless we vote them out they will be in government for years. She adds that the SNP is the challenger in every Tory-held seat in Scotland. On social care, Swinson says this is exactly the issue that requires cross-party working, but that the Conservative government has delayed it for years. Sunak says: \u201cNext year should we spend time talking about these kinds of issues, or Brexit?\u201d Sturgeon says that free personal care has existed in Scotland for a decade. These parties need to get on with it, she says. Some reaction to the debate so far: The politicians are asked a question on why politicians can\u2019t work together on the big questions like climate change and social care. Adam Price says that no party has a monopoly on the truth and that we need to look at the use of citizens\u2019 assemblies, as they have done in Ireland. Burgon says they can\u2019t work with the Tories on anything at all because they brought in austerity, among other things. Sturgeon says that Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage are the roadblocks on climate change and social care, so it\u2019s important to keep them out of government. Berry says that \u201cthis is how the Greens work\u201d because they are rarely in government. They often work with other parties to push them to act on the big issues, she says. Sunak says that he has two small daughters who care deeply about environmental issues. He says that although parties have a different approach on how to get there, they all want to get to the same point. Farage says that the approach to climate change by the main parties will put a lot of people out of work, so would be making the poor pay instead of the rich. Berry says that her party\u2019s policies would create three million jobs. Swinson says that she has worked with politicians across the spectrum on a variety of issues. Sturgeon says she doesn\u2019t think it was the right thing to do for the Lib Dems to work with the Conservatives to bring in austerity and policies like the bedroom tax. On the idea that \u201cTrump wants to buy the NHS\u201d, Sunak tells Burgon: \u201cYou really must stop making these reckless allegations\u201d. Farage says Trump \u201cisn\u2019t going to buy it, Richard\u201d. Burgon brings up the recording of Farage saying that the UK should look at an insurance model for healthcare. The Brexit party leader says he never said that. \u201cDear oh dear. Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie,\u201d says Farage. Again, here\u2019s our story on that, for a bit of background. Burgon says there\u2019s a real risk that Johnson is going to do a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d with Donald Trump on the NHS. Price says that the biggest threat to the NHS in Wales is the Labour government, not Trump. Burgon accuses the Plaid leader of playing Tory games by attacking Labour and not them. Si\u00e2n Berry says that the credit rating agencies downgraded the UK\u2019s credit scores, so it is not true to say that the Conservatives had managed the economy well. Sunak said he\u2019s read the report and that they had said this was because of the uncertainty caused by Brexit. Berry says that uncertainty was caused by his party\u2019s mishandling of Brexit. Burgon is asked about the IFS\u2019s assessment that Tory and Labour plans were unfeasible. Burgon says that the IFS is entitled to its opinion, but that other thinktanks have taken a different view. Sunak says that debt will be down with a Conservative government. Farage tells him to stop lying. \u201cYou cut the deficit and not the debt,\u201d he said. \u201cDebt is massively up.\u201d Sturgeon says it is rich for Farage to accuse someone else of lying after the line that the UK would be able to spend an extra \u00a3350m on the NHS after Brexit. Farage says he never campaigned under that slogan. From Nazia Parveen backstage in Salford: Disbelief and a fair amount of shock across the political spectrum backstage in ITV\u2019s spin room when Farage defended Donald Trump saying \u201cmen say bad things sometimes\u201d. On the nuclear deterrent: Swinson says we should keep our deterrent and work for multilateral disarmament. Sturgeon says that we don\u2019t countenance chemical weapons anymore, so why should we allow weapons that wipe out swathes of the population. Farage says we live in a dangerous world and should keep the deterrent. Burgon says Labour\u2019s policy is to keep Trident as a deterrent, but that politicians shouldn\u2019t boast about being willing to push the button. \u201cWhy have it then?\u201d says Farage. \u201cExactly,\u201d says Sturgeon. Sunak attacks Corbyn for questioning the evidence that Russia was behind the chemical attack on Salisbury. Burgon says that\u2019s not true. Here\u2019s our story from the time: Sunak says Trump is here for a Nato summit to discuss security and that is very important for keeping us safe. He says it\u2019s important that a UK prime minister can maintain those relationships. Price says it can never be acceptable to talk about \u201cgrabbing women by the pussy\u201d and says that we have a prime minister who described gay men like him as \u201cbumboys\u201d and Muslim women as letterboxes. \u201cThese men are not fit to be in public life,\u201d he says. Richard Burgon says he wouldn\u2019t attend a state dinner with Donald Trump. He says it\u2019s important to have a prime minister who thinks for themselves. Corbyn was right to oppose the invasion of Iraq, he says. Farage says that Obama introduced the \u201cso-called Muslim ban\u201d and nobody complained about that. He is very American and not to everybody\u2019s tastes, but \u201che is our most important friend in the world\u201d. Farage says that the biggest lie of the election campaign is that the US president wants to buy the NHS. Asked by Swinson about Trump\u2019s sexual assault boasts, Farage says: \u201cMen say dreadful things sometimes ... but if all of us were caught out on a night out after a drink...\u201d Burgon brings up Trump\u2019s \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and the locking up of immigrant children. He says Trump wants his \u201cfat-cat friends to have access to our National Health Service\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s just not true,\u201d says Farage. Sturgeon says that relations with the US are important but, when it comes to Trump, the government \u201cshould sup with a very long spoon\u201d. On \u201cthe special relationship\u201d: Swinson says there are three people in the special relationship: Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Donald Trump. She says Trump has previously boasted about sexually assaulting women and threatens the rights of minorities. Farage says the special relationship is more important than ever in the face of the European defence union which is being set up to compete with Nato. Si\u00e2n Berry says she is terrified of Trump. She says she thinks about the powerful peace project we could build with the power of Nato and the budget behind Trident renewal. There\u2019s an ad break now. The Guardian north of England correspondent Nazia Parveen is watching the debate backstage: There were guffaws from the Brexit party table, from the MEP Dr David Bull, in ITV\u2019s spin room when Jo Swinson accused Boris Johnson of sending his \u201ccheerleader\u201d Nigel Farage to the debate instead of attending himself. On immigration: Farage says there has been an 8m rise in immigration since Tony Blair came to power. He says he knows that people come here and work very hard in coffee shops, but that there are too many of them. Berry says that the NHS is staffed by immigrants. \u201cIsn\u2019t that terrible?\u201d says Farage. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we training our own people?\u201d Burgon says that he doesn\u2019t trust the Conservatives to deal with migrant rights after the Windrush scandal. Burgon says Labour will not be doing any back room or front room deals with the SNP. Sturgeon says that she would just ask that Labour recognises the Scottish government\u2019s right to hold another referendum. Swinson says that she disagrees with the SNP, but the Tory party and Labour say they are in favour of the union while doing things to undermine it. Sturgeon says that she respects the fact people in the room are not in favour of independence but she doesn\u2019t respect the fact they wish to \u201cdeny the people of Scotland the right to be in charge of that decision\u201d. Sunak says that Farage has been a tireless campaigner for Brexit, but that the Tories are the only party that can deliver Brexit. \u201cBut what are you going to deliver?\u201d says Farage. The Brexit party leader says that leaving would mean not having the European court of justice ruling over our country, as Johnson\u2019s deal would allow. Adam Price quotes Tony Benn\u2019s criticism of \u201cweathervane politicians\u201d as opposed to \u201csignpost politicians\u201d. Burgon says he is disappointed that Price is \u201ctrying to play the Tory game\u201d of blaming Labour for the Tory-created Brexit crisis. Sturgeon asks Sunak if he can take a no-deal Brexit off the table. \u201cWe already have a deal to leave the European Union,\u201d he says. Sturgeon points out that it\u2019s only a withdrawal deal. He doesn\u2019t answer the question. \u201cI thought you liked independence,\u201d Farage says to Sturgeon, raising some modest laughs from the audience. Burgon says he will speak to his local party members after Corbyn has negotiated a new deal in order to decide whether he will support leave or remain. Swinson asks Burgon if he thinks it\u2019s possible for Labour to negotiate a better Brexit deal than remaining in the European Union. \u201cThe point is it would be for the people to decide,\u201d he says. \u201cCan we just cut to the chase, there is no Brexit deal better than remaining,\u201d says Sturgeon. Now a question on Brexit. Sunak says that whether you voted leave or remain, it\u2019s time \u201cfor us as a country to move forward\u201d. Sturgeon says Scotland voted to remain by a proportion of 60%. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sign of a strong union if Scotland can be dragged out against our will.\u201d Price says that many people in the Welsh coalfield communities voted for Brexit because they were exasperated by their situation. He says Brexit will do the opposite of economic change for Wales. Swinson says that Brexit is nowhere near done. We know from all of the government\u2019s analysis that remaining in the EU will mean we have more money,\u201d she says. Burgon says that Labour knows its role is to bring people together and that is why Corbyn will remain neutral and be \u201can honest broker\u201d. \u201cOn one hand we have the Lib Dems who want to ignore everybody who voted leave and on the other side we have the Thatcherites ... who want to ignore everyone who voted to remain,\u201d he says. Berry says that the best way to get back to fixing the country is through a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d and she does think that Brexit is a bad idea. Farage says that democracy works through \u201closers\u2019 consent\u201d and the other parties are refusing to do that. If they lost a second referendum, remainer parties still wouldn\u2019t accept it, he said. Nigel Farage says: \u201cIs there anybody else on the platform concerned that there are 74 convicted terrorists out on our streets?\u201d Sturgeon interjects: \u201cWe are all concerned, Nigel.\u201d \u201cSurely they should be locked up for life?\u201d Farage continues. \u201cSilence is golden.\u201d Si\u00e2n Berry says that police cuts are real and that officers do not have time together out of their vans to work with communities. We need real rehabilitation, she says. We can\u2019t just leave people to fester in jail. Adam Price says there are serious questions that need to be answered. He makes reference to the Aitchison report, which contained recommendations which were ignored. Price says that he wants a prime minister who will not seek to divide at a time like this, pointing to Johnson\u2019s attempt to blame \u201ca lefty government\u201d this morning. Sunak says McDonnell once signed a letter calling for MI5 to be disbanded and for the police to be disarmed. Burgon says that the Conservatives always reach for pre-packaged lines to smear the Labour party. \u201cThe priority needs to be to reduce the [number of] victims of crime, not writing rhetoric-filled articles,\u201d he says. Sturgeon highlights Johnson\u2019s claim this morning that parliament had blocked his Queen\u2019s speech, when parliament actually passed it. Sturgeon says that Johnson has done a disservice to victims by the \u201ccrass way he has sought to politicise it\u201d. She says that it wasn\u2019t right that Khan was allowed out, but that lessons should be learned in the right way. Sunak says that Johnson has long been a believer that serious offenders shouldn\u2019t be eligible for automatic release. Sunak answers a question from an audience member as to why Usman Khan was free to stage his attack. He repeats the line that has been repeated by the government all day that it was because of rules introduced by the last Labour government. Burgon says that it is not true that the only option was to release the London Bridge attacker. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want history lessons after this atrocity,\u201d he says. They want answers about how we are going to keep them safe, he says. Burgon then goes on to talking about deep cuts to services. \u201cWe can\u2019t do security on the cheap\u201d. Farage says that nobody has apologised. He says that these people \u201chave the virus of jihadism\u201d and should never be released unless we are sure they are cured. The debate is under way. Each politician can make an opening statement. Si\u00e2n Berry from the Greens says \u201cwe are in dark and dangerous times\u201d and that promises are often broke by politicians. She says that things can change if people vote for it. Brexit would change things for the worse, she says. \u201cShine a light in the darkness with your vote. If not now, when?\u201d Jo Swinson from the Lib Dems says that Boris Johnson can\u2019t be bothered to talk to voters tonight so he\u2019s sent his cheerleader, Nigel Farage. \u201cWe deserve better than the Farage, Trump, Johnson nightmare,\u201d she says. \u201cI love out country, our United Kingdom. Open, fair, generous,\u201d she says. Rishi Sunak for the Conservatives says that he and everybody else is fed up with Brexit. \u201cThe only way to move on is to elect a Conservative government, so let\u2019s end the delay and get Brexit done,\u201d he says. The Brexit party\u2019s Nigel Farage says that confidence in politics has never been so low. He says that every mainstream party told people to vote remain and they didn\u2019t. He says that once we have left the EU, that is just the start of the revolution that needs to happen. \u201cThe Brexit party are the new radicals ... Let\u2019s get back to being a proper functioning democracy.\u201d Nicola Sturgeon for the SNP says that she wants an independent Scotland but also wants to play her part by locking Johnson out of Downing Street. She says that Brexit will cause chaos for years to come. Adam Price for Plaid Cymru says that in Wales it\u2019s difficult not to feel despair \u201cbecause we are going backwards from health to the economy\u201d. \u201cFor us it\u2019s not more Westminster, it\u2019s more Wales,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will put out people first,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want them to feel hope again in those beating Welsh hearts.\u201d Richard Burgon from Labour starts by extending sympathies to the victims of Friday\u2019s London Bridge attack. He says that deep cuts to vital public services happened at the same time that the government made huge tax give aways to big businesses. \u201cLabour are for the many, not for the few\u201d. Politicians are gearing up for this evening\u2019s election debate in Salford. I\u2019ll be bringing you updates throughout. Here\u2019s a reminder of those taking part. Richard Burgon for Labour Rishi Sunak for the Conservatives Jo Swinson for the Lib Dems Nicola Sturgeon for the SNP Nigel Farage for the Brexit party Adam Price for Plaid Cymru Si\u00e2n Berry for the Greens The Guardian\u2019s former home affairs editor, Alan Travis, has written about the government\u2019s \u201clock terrorists up and throw away the key\u201d response to Friday\u2019s attack. [...] Other criminologists have reported that there is a widespread refusal among extremist prisoners to take part in deradicalisation programmes. It would seem that reports that Khan\u2019s unsuccessful request to participate were the exception rather than the rule. Gove needs to account for why, after so much effort, his flagship \u201cjihadi jails\u201d have so far failed. With reports that as many as three-quarters of convicted terrorist prisoners reject engagement with the deradicalisation programme, this must be the fundamental issue to be tackled. Against this background Johnson\u2019s obsessive focus on ending all automatic early release is not only dangerously misplaced but also ignores the fact that there is no such thing as \u201cautomatic early release\u201d now for prisoners convicted of terrorism-related offences. However long convicted terrorists are locked up, with the exception of a limited number of the most heinous cases, they are all going to have to be released eventually. The \u201clock \u2019em up and throw away the key\u201d battle cry may suit a panicked politician in the middle of a general election campaign, but it isn\u2019t going to keep us safe from another Usman Khan. The Liberal Democrats have warned that Brexit is contributing to a serious brain drain in UK universities, revealing figures that show almost 11,000 EU academics have left since the 2016 referendum, reports Guardian political correspondent Peter Walker. The figures, based on freedom of information responses from universities, show 10,918 left in the three years starting with the 2016-17 financial year. In 2018-19, 4,014 quit, 31% more than in 2015-16, and 40% more than in 2014-15. The figures are almost certain to be underestimates of the real total, because the study is based on 81 universities that responded to the requests. Universities UK, the main representative body for the higher education sector, has 136 members. You can read the full story here: An observation by the Yorkshire Post\u2019s political editor, Rob Parsons. Jeremy Corbyn has been out campaigning in north Yorkshire wearing a specially made jacket with his motto \u201cfor the many not the few\u201d printed on it. According to the PA news agency, the Labour leader said it was a present from Fabian Hamilton, who is standing in the Leeds North East constituency, and he was given it on Saturday night ahead of an NHS-themed rally. \u201cHe has a friend of his who is a tailor. He gave me this jacket and it\u2019s quite splendid,\u201d said Corbyn. \u201cIt almost fits. I don\u2019t know if we need the jacket to grow or me to shrink.\u201d Boris Johnson defended his record during a major setpiece interview with Andrew Marr on the BBC while laying out his election pitch and attacking Labour. But how accurate were his assertions? Boris Johnson has sought to blame Labour for the release of Usman Khan, the convicted terrorist who murdered two people on London Bridge on Friday, as the aftermath of the attack became an increasingly politicised election issue. In an interview on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, the prime minister said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d that someone such as Khan should have been freed midway through an earlier sentence, and pledged to change the law, saying: \u201cThe reason this killer was out on the streets was because of automatic early release which was brought in by a leftie government.\u201d A woman killed in the London Bridge attack was named as Saskia Jones, 23, a former Cambridge student. In a statement, Prof Stephen J Toope, the vice-chancellor of the university, said: \u201cI am devastated to learn that among the victims of the London Bridge attack were staff and alumni of the University of Cambridge, taking part in an event to mark five years of the Learning Together programme.\u201d Britain\u2019s repeated military interventions have \u201cexacerbated rather than resolved\u201d the problem of terrorism, according to Jeremy Corbyn, who described Boris Johnson as the world\u2019s leading sycophant towards President Trump. The Labour leader used a speech in York to warn that the so-called \u201cwar on terror has manifestly failed\u201d, adding that the world is \u201cliving with the consequences\u201d of the botched invasion of Iraq, which he opposed. Corbyn also warned that the UK risks being dragged into a further conflict with Iran and that Labour will \u201cstop arms sales to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen and work to end the war there, not actively support it as the Conservative government has done\u201d. There is no sign that Boris Johnson will agree to an interview with Andrew Neil before the end of the election campaign, with both the BBC and the Conservatives simply saying that negotiations are ongoing. With little over a week until polling day, the prime minister has still not set a date for his one-on-one interview on primetime television, despite every other party leader agreeing to take part. The UK is on the brink of having the most untrustworthy prime minister of all time, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey has said. Davey criticised Johnson\u2019s response to the London Bridge terror attack and called on him to apologise for \u201cmisleading people\u201d over the law regarding early release. He also warned Johnson that he \u201cshouldn\u2019t be trying to make political capital out of a tragedy\u201d. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab has insisted that the Tories were not politicising the London Bridge attack but taking \u201cnecessary\u201d measures to protect the public. \u201cWe\u2019ve said that we would expect for the serious terrorist offences a minimum of a 14-year sentence \u2026 We don\u2019t think that it is the case that they should necessarily be released, we think for some offences they should be imprisoned for life and we also think that terrorist offenders should serve their full sentence, both as a matter of public protection and also confidence in the system.\u201d None of the main parties in the general election has a coherent plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport, the biggest source of carbon in the UK, according to campaigners. The Conservative manifesto highlights the need to repair potholes, but the nearly \u00a330bn to be spent on roads is expected to add to greenhouse gases at a time when they need to be reduced drastically, a report by three NGOs says. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have pledges to invest in rail and other public transport, with Labour doing so through nationalising the railways, but they also fall short. The Liberal Democrats have suspended a member of staff and have launched an inquiry in relation to claims that evidence was faked to mislead investigators at Open Democracy, the website reports. There is no sign that Boris Johnson will agree to an interview with Andrew Neil before the end of the election campaign, with both the BBC and the Conservatives simply saying that negotiations are ongoing. With little over a week until polling day, the prime minister has still not set a date for his one-on-one interview on primetime television, despite every other party leader agreeing to take part. On Friday the BBC insisted it would not allow Johnson to appear on its flagship politics programmes until he had agreed a time to sit down with Neil, only to relent following the London Bridge terror attack on the basis that the country should hear from its prime minister during a time of crisis. Johnson duly appeared on Sunday\u2019s edition of The Andrew Marr Show, where he insisted he was \u201cperfectly happy to be interviewed by any interviewer called Andrew from the BBC\u201d but there is still no confirmed date for the programme, with only a handful of potential slots available before polls open next Thursday. Nazir Afzal, former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, has also weighed in against the prime minister over his comments about the context in which the London Bridge attacker was released Ian Acheson, a counter terrorism expert who advised ministers on the risks from Islamic extremism in prison, has been adding to his claims in the Sunday Times today that recommendations that might have prevented the London Bridge attack were ignored. After being asked to do so by Michael Gove in 2015, Acheson and a team visited dozens of prisons at home and abroad, finding \u201cserious deficiencies\u201d in almost every aspect of the management of terrorist offenders through the system that are relevant to Usman Khan, the London Bridge attacker. Sixty nine recommendations were made, of which 68 were accepted, before being \u201cconflated\u201d into the 11 that made it into an official response to his report. The public have a fundamental right to be protected, especially from known terrorist offenders, he added, and this must always be the primary consideration of government and the public protection agencies in the criminal justice system. \u201cI have felt for some time that the balance is out of kilter. I have serious concerns about the appetite of those at the top of the prison and probation service to take the action needed to protect the public and manage the risks.\u201d He has tweeted today: The New York Times has a piece suggesting that Prince Charles is asserting a \u201cnewfound authority\u201d in British royal affairs against the backdrop of the controversy around Prince Andrew. However, there are also some interesting observations from a US perspective about the political backdrop to the crisis. Mark Landler writes that it has erupted at a time when Britain\u2019s political leaders, paralyzed by Brexit, are in little position to help. \u201cFar from steadying the crown, as Prime Minister Tony Blair did when the queen misjudged the public mood after the death of Princess Diana in 1997, today\u2019s politicians are drawing her into their own frantic machinations.\u201d He adds: \u201cCritics accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of misleading the queen when he asked her to suspend Parliament for a period of weeks, rather than the customary few days, in an effort to curtail parliamentary discussion and action on Brexit. The decision was later declared illegal by Britain\u2019s Supreme Court. \u201cWhen the queen presented Mr. Johnson\u2019s legislative agenda just weeks before Mr. Johnson called an election, critics said she was being exploited to deliver a campaign manifesto dressed up as a queen\u2019s speech.\u201d A meeting of officials in the government\u2019s emergency committee, Cobra, has taken place this afternoon, Downing Street has said. The prime minister has been updated on the investigation into the London Bridge attack by security officials, a No 10 spokesman added. It looks particularly busy on the campaign trail today meanwhile. The Women\u2019s Equality party (WEP), which has sought to place the issue of violence and misogyny against women front and centre in the campaign, has been on the ground in Canterbury to support Labour\u2019s Rosie Duffield, who spoke in parliament in October about her own experience of domestic abuse. The prime minister\u2019s partner, Carrie Symonds, is out canvassing for Zac Goldsmith in west London: Alastair Campbell \u2013 out canvassing to help re-elect the Labour MP and former minister Pat McFadden \u2013 has tweeted some video of the lengths to which he has apparently gone today to secure one vote in particular. Don\u2019t be alarmed as the camera pans down in the first few seconds: The Conservatives\u2019 lack of policies on equal rights for LGBT+ voters will not go unnoticed, argues Jonathan Cooper, a lawyer and human rights specialist. While David Cameron learned from Tony Blair that the LGBT+ vote mattered, Cooper writes in the Guardian: \u201cThe lack of any real substance in the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto in relation to LGBT rights suggests the party has either learned nothing from Cameron\u2019s success and May\u2019s blunder or it is supremely confident of its majority and thinks it has no need to court gay people. \u201cThe manifesto makes two references to LGBT people, one to sexual orientation, among a long list of other protected grounds, and no reference to gender identity or trans people.\u201d No journalist likes to refuse an interview but there was a good reason for the BBC to refuse to play into Boris Johnson\u2019s hands by having him on The Andrew Marr Show today, argues Jane Martinson in the Guardian. While Johnson has avoided a grilling at the hands of Andrew Neil, she adds that the public interest was hardly served in the wake of the London Bridge attacks by Johnson \u201cfilibustering his way out of any answers as though he were a poor contestant on Just a Minute\u201d. Marr tried his best but even describing Johnson\u2019s refusal to stop talking over him or answering the questions as \u2018chuntering\u2019, rather than \u2018lying\u2019, felt wrong. While other recent \u201ccock-ups\u201d at the BBC have already prompted an alarming number of online conspiracy theories and staff morale is low, Martinson warns of a corrosion in public trust. Read the full piece here. The Liberal Democrats could not support Labour\u2019s renationalisation plans in the event of a hung parliament, the party\u2019s leader, Jo Swinson, has said. She described Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s programme as \u201ca distraction\u201d and said the Labour party had \u201cnot been clear about how they would pay for it\u201d. The Liberal Democrat leader added she did not believe renationalisation was \u201cthe way forward\u201d. Asked whether she would support Labour\u2019s plans, she told BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics: \u201cNo, I think renationalisation is a distraction. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a way to deliver better public services and I think it\u2019s taking us away from, actually, how do you make things better for people?\u201d Pushed for further clarity on whether the Liberal Democrats would block the renationalisation of water, she said: \u201cWe don\u2019t think that renationalisation is the way forward.\u201d Questioned further on whether the Liberal Democrats would veto renationalisation, she said the issue was a \u201cfantasy situation\u201d. She added: \u201cNobody is expecting, on the current scenario, that Jeremy Corbyn is getting anywhere near Downing Street and the Liberal Democrats are going to put him there. So the Labour manifesto, it\u2019s a wish list, they cannot deliver it.\u201d The campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller has called on remain voters to vote tactically in the general election, saying that doing so could prevent a Conservative majority. Presenting a new poll and MRP seat projection for \u201cRemain United\u201d on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, she said: \u201cWith no tactical voting, just based on voter intention at the moment and where the polls are sitting and the difference between the seats, there would be a 12-seat majority for the Conservatives. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re giving people recommendations and the other polling we did was on tactical voting intentions and what we\u2019re finding is that it is staying stable for about 45% of remain and soft leave voters saying that they intend to tactically vote.\u201d Facebook appears to have acquiesced to BBC demands that they take down adverts featuring footage of journalists Laura Kuenssberg and Huw Edwards. As reported by the Guardian\u2019s Jim Waterson, the broadcaster had argued that their inclusion could damage perceptions of the corporation\u2019s impartiality. A woman who was one of the two people killed in the London Bridge attack was a former Cambridge University student. The university has released a statement after Jack Merritt, a course coordinator for Learning Together, a programme run by the University of Cambridge\u2019s institute of criminology, was named as the first victim in the London Bridge attack. In a statement on Sunday, Prof Stephen J Toope, vice-chancellor of the university, said: \u201cI am devastated to learn that among the victims of the London Bridge attack were staff and alumni of the University of Cambridge, taking part in an event to mark five years of the Learning Together programme. \u201cWhat should have been a joyous opportunity to celebrate the achievements of this unique and socially transformative programme, hosted by our Institute of Criminology, was instead disrupted by an unspeakable criminal act. \u201cI am sad beyond words to report that a course co-ordinator, Jack Merritt, was killed, as was a former student not yet named by the Metropolitan police. Among the three people injured, whose identities have not been publicly released, is a member of university staff. \u201cOur university condemns this abhorrent and senseless act of terror. Our condolences, our thoughts and our deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families.\u201d The medical director for the NHS in London, Dr Vin Diwakar, has meanwhile said that one of the three people injured in the attack had been allowed to return home while the other two remained in a stable condition in hospital. Boris Johnson has sought to blame Labour for the release of Usman Khan, the convicted terrorist who murdered two people on London Bridge on Friday, as the aftermath of the attack became an increasingly politicised election issue. In an interview on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, the prime minister said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d that someone such as Khan should have been freed midway through an earlier sentence, and pledged to change the law, saying: \u201cThe reason this killer was out on the streets was because of automatic early release which was brought in by a leftie government.\u201d Britain\u2019s repeated military interventions have \u201cexacerbated rather than resolved\u201d the problem of terrorism, according to Jeremy Corbyn, who described Boris Johnson as the world\u2019s leading sycophant towards President Trump.

Labour and the Liberal Democrats have pledges to invest in rail and other public transport, with Labour doing so through nationalising the railways, but they also fall short. The prime minister has been accused of plagiarism by a popular Twitter user on legal affairs who says that Boris Johnson \u201ccopied and pasted\u201d from a blog written about the background to the London bridge attacks. The Tories have been seeking to use comments by Jeremy Corbyn in his Sky News earlier in which he said - in answer to questioning - that convicted terrorists shoudl \u201cnot necessarily\u201d serve a full sentence. The Conservative digital operation have produced an infographic which is being tweeted by Tory ministers and other senior figures. Such is the way of modern political campaigning. For what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s the context of the \u201cnot necessarily\u201d quote: Sophy Ridge: Of course his [London Bridge attacker Usman Khan] original sentence was 16 years, do you think that people convicted of terrorism offences need to serve a full prison sentence? Corbyn: I think it depends on the circumstances, it depends on the sentence but crucially depends on what they\u2019ve done in prison \u2026 Ridge: So not necessarily then? Corbyn: No, not necessarily, no. I think there has to be an examination of how our prison services work and crucially what happens to them on release from prison.. The line-up is emerging for tonight\u2019s seven way debate on ITV: \u2022 Richard Burgon for Labour \u2022 Rishi Sunak for the Conservatives \u2022 Nicola Sturgeon for the SNP \u2022 Nigel Farage for the Brexit Party \u2022 Adam Price for Plaid \u2022 Sian Berry for the Greens While Raab\u2019s seat is at risk, the Mail on Sunday reports that the Tories have been wargaming the possibility of the party winning the election but Johnson losing his seat, where his majority of 5,000 is the target of a sustained Momentum-fuelled labour challenge. The Mail\u2019s Harry Cole writes: \u201cI understand the plan would see a Conservative MP with a big majority near London asked to step up to the Lords on a promise of high office, with a by-election being triggered within days of the December 12 vote,\u201d \u201cMeanwhile First Secretary of State Dominic Raab would represent Mr Johnson and No 10 in the Commons.\u201d But what happens if Raab is gone as well? Here\u2019s what the Guardian\u2019s Caroline Davies found when she recently visited Uxbridge to talk about the attempt to remove Johnson. This was overlooked a little bit earlier but Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has insisted that he is \u201cnot really\u201d worried about losing his seat in the General Election. Raab, who is MP for Esher and Walton in Surrey, acknowledged on Sky News that \u201cwith a seat like mine you never take anything for granted\u201d. His comments came as a poll reported by The Observer suggests Mr Raab is at risk of losing his seat in a tactical voting switch. Raab enjoys a healthy majority of 23,298, but a Deltapoll survey of the constituency indicates he now only holds a five-point lead over Lib Dem opponent Monica Harding. The Tories have held the seat since 1910 but it voted 58% Remain in the 2016 referendum - and the former Brexit secretary is vocally anti-Brussels. Asked if he was worried about being \u201cthe next Portillo at this election\u201d, losing his seat in Surrey to the Lib Dems, Mr Raab told Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cNot really, but look ... no well, the truth is with a seat like mine you never take anything for granted.\u201d He added: \u201cThe polls are all fluid and all over the place, but one thing it does show you, my constituency and up and down the country, is the risk of a hung parliament and that is a very real risk if you vote any other way than Conservative. There are some interesting lines at the end from Corbyn about patriotism, often regarded as a front on which his opponents have been eager to hammer him on \u201cI am patriotic about the people of this country,\u201d he says, to applause. \u201cPatriotism is about supporting each other, not attacking somebody else. It\u2019s about caring for the whole of society, for all our people, and not walking by on the other side when they need help and support.\u201d Corbyn says that \u201cLabour\u2019s new internationalism\u201d means the party will create a peace and conflict-prevention fund, and invest an extra \u00a3400 million to expand Britain\u2019s diplomatic capacity and increase oversight of arms exports to ensure the UK is not fuelling conflicts, \u201cas in Yemen and in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\u201d He adds: \u201cLabour stands behind the international consensus of a genuine two-state solution \u2013 a secure Israel alongside a secure and viable state of Palestine.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why Labour supports an end to half a century of Israeli occupation and the illegal settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, and a Labour government will recognise the state of Palestine.\u201d It is time for Britain to stop clinging on to Donald Trump\u2019s coat-tails, says Corbyn, who describes the prime minister as the world\u2019s leading sycophant towards the US president. \u201cFrom climate change denial to unconditional support for the Israeli far right, from racism to confrontation with China, Trump is taking the world on a dangerous path.\u201d \u201cBritain must make its own foreign policy free from a knee-jerk subservience to a US administration which repudiates our values.\u201d He goes on to call on Johnson to release a potentially incendiary report examining Russian infiltration in British politics, including the Conservative party. Corbyn adds that the government is also refusing to release another report into Saudi funding of extremist groups in Britain, adding: \u201cGiven Friday\u2019s events and the continuing terror threat it is simply unacceptable that this report is not in the public domain.\u201d Corbyn turns to the Iraq war, saying: \u201cSixteen years ago, I warned against the invasion and occupation of Iraq. \u201cI said it would set off a spiral of conflict, hate, misery, desperation that will fuel the wars, the conflict, the terrorism and the misery of future generations. \u201cIt did, and we are still living with the consequences today.\u201d He goes on: \u201cBritain\u2019s repeated military interventions in North Africa and the wider Middle East, including Afghanistan, have exacerbated rather than resolved the problems.\u201d \u201cNow we risk being dragged into a further conflict with Iran on the side of a Saudi regime which is an enemy of human rights prolonging a desperate humanitarian crisis in Yemen, interfering in its neighbours\u2019 affairs and murdering journalists.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn is speaking at an election event in York, where he is talking about the London bridge attack and tells those gathered that it is \u201cmore important than ever\u201d for communities to come together. People have a right to know what steps political leaders will take to keep people safe. The Labour leader goes on to reiterate his comments this morning that police were right to take the steps that they took on London Bridge \u2013 shooting Usman Khan dead in the belief that he was wearing a suicide vest. However, Corbyn says that the part privatisation of the probation service by the Conservatives was a \u201cdisaster \u201cYou can\u2019t keep people safe on the cheap,\u201d he adds. \u201cReal security does not only come from strong laws and intelligence. it comes from effective public services. He turns, as expected, to foreign policy, adding that \u201cfor far too long\u201d Britain\u2019s leaders have taken the wrong steps. Too often the acts of successive governments have fuelled the threat of terrorism. Boris Johnson will be the first UK prime minister - if re-elected - to enter office with the union under peril, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party has claimed. Steve Aiken, of the Northern Ireland party with historic links to the Conservatives, said he hoped Johnson would not be re-elected as an MP next month. He described the prime minister\u2019s proposed Brexit withdrawal deal as threatening to make Northern Ireland \u201ca place apart\u201d due to the proposed regulatory border. \u201cThe DUP on October 2 agreed to a border down the Irish Sea, that allowed Boris Johnson to march in with his withdrawal deal, and if the withdrawal deal goes through, Northern Ireland will well and truly be a place apart,\u201d Aiken told the Press Association. \u201cBut Boris Johnson\u2019s activities are not just affecting Northern Ireland, they are affecting the entirety of the United Kingdom, and he is probably going to be the first prime minister if he gets re-elected \u2013 which I hope he doesn\u2019t \u2013 he is going to be the first prime minister that comes back in a situation where the future of the union itself is under threat.\u201d Aiken\u2019s party has been without MPs since 2017 when Tom Elliott lost his seat in Fermanagh and South Tyrone and Danny Kinahan lost in South Antrim. None of the main parties in the general election has a coherent plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport, the biggest source of carbon in the UK, according to campaigners. The Conservative manifesto highlights the need to repair potholes, but the nearly \u00a330bn to be spent on roads is expected to add to greenhouse gases at a time when they need to be reduced drastically, a report by three NGOs says. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have pledges to invest in rail and other public transport, with Labour doing so through nationalising the railways, but they also fall short. Transport has become the biggest source of UK emissions and is on the increase, rising by 3% a year, while carbon from energy generation has fallen. The Department for Transport has been criticised for \u201cgoing rogue\u201d by planning for big increases in road transport while neglecting public transport and the need to invest for a low-carbon future. Read on Battling against the grain of an otherwise largely critical reaction to Boris Johnson\u2019s appearance on The Andrew Marr Show, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has popped up on Twitter to do a bit of cheerleading for his boss Something has gone wrong for the Lib Dems, according to Andrew Rawnsley, who writes in the Observer that the one of the party\u2019s number has admitted to him that the election has not gone as planned. More than a week before polling day, senior figures in the party already start sentences with the phrase: \u201cWhen we conduct the postmortem \u2026\u201d Some of it is down to tactical mistakes, he adds, but in the final furlong of the campaign, the Lib Dems will be marketing a vote for them as the means to prevent Boris Johnson from getting a majority. \u201cThey will be pitching themselves as the Boris-blockers. It is an admission that they have dramatically calibrated their own ambitions downwards, but it is a better strategy than trying to persist with the pretence that Ms Swinson is going to become prime minister. When you are given lemons, make lemonade.\u201d There\u2019s an interesting poll in the Sunday Times Scotland (\u00a3), which does not actually deal with the election taking place next week yet could have significant impact on what comes after it. A Panelbase survey of voting intention for the 2021 Holyrood elections finds that, while the SNP hold their lead, the Scottish Conservatives enjoy a boost, meaning that the final results will be short of a pro-independence majority. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, calculates that, according to these intentions, the SNP would win 60 seats and the Greens four, leaving them one short of a majority, while among unionist parties, the Tories would win 35 seats, Labour 21 and the Lib Dems nine, enabling them to vote down a referendum. While Nicola Sturgeon continues to call for a second independence referendum next year, neither Labour nor the Conservatives are likely to grant her the powers to do so \u2013 however, Jeremy Corbyn has suggested that a pro-independence majority at Holyrood could change his mind on the subject. So here\u2019s yet another known unknown to throw into this most unpredictable of election campaigns. So how do you interview Boris Johnson? That Eddie Mair interview from back in 2013 stands to some as a template for how to approach him when the ruffling of hair and stream-of-consciousness quotes from classical texts are used to distract. Reacting to earlier today, there are opponents who insist that it still reflects badly on him. Here\u2019s the SNP leader and Scotland\u2019s first minister: Some more thoughts: And on a theme which Johnson kept implicitly evoking In place of a grilling by the more formidable Andrew Neil, which Labour fears the prime minister will duck, Boris Johnson\u2019s interview with Andrew Marr will have to suffice for now. But it was a scrappy affair, and one that Tory strategists are to be likely be satisfied with as their man hustled over the finishing line managing to commit few if any acts of \u201cmaking news\u201d. About the only one was the figure of 74 which Johnson gave for the number of people who are out on early release in circumstances similar to that of the London Bridge attacker. Marr repeatedly accused the prime minister of seeking to run the clock down, talking over questions in order to avoid answering them or just continuing to blame Labour in government, despite the Tories having been in power since 2010. It came to a rushed conclusion, with Marr asking the prime minister questions such as \u201cAre you going to meet Donald Trump this week at the Nato summit?\u201d to which the obvious and easy answer was: \u201cOf course I am.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, came through his interview with Sophy Ridge of Sky \u2013 broadcast earlier \u2013 without taking much flak either. When the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, came on afterwards, he seemed primed to attack the Labour leader over his past comments about shoot-to-kill policies. Corbyn \u2013 presumably better primed by advisers at this point \u2013 had sought to nullify such attack lines, however, by agreeing that police at London Bridge had no choice but to shoot Usman Khan dead. There were other moments. Corbyn talked about the size of the royal family, but it\u2019s highly debatable how much that will be a vote loser (or even a winner with some?). On foreign policy, he was nuanced on Nato and avoided leaving hostages to fortune by repeating past comments made from the time when he was more likely to be in the front line of Stop the War marches than on the opposition frontbenches, although one or two lines might invite further scrutiny. When he talked about \u201cbringing about a respectful relationship with Russia\u201d, was this an echo of his past criticism of Nato expansion into states such as Ukraine? Overall though, this was an assured performance by Corbyn, perhaps one of his best during the campaign so far. But it was largely playing it safe when his party are trailing the Tories in the polls. Johnson is asked at the end of the interview why he is avoiding being interviewed by Andrew Neil, who has already cross-examined Jeremy Corbyn. The Tory leader makes light of it, applauding Marr\u2019s brilliance. \u201cI am perfectly happy to be interviewed by any interviewer called Andrew from the BBC,\u201d replies Johnson. Is that a commitment? The interview ends in a rushed and \u2013 in keeping with its tone throughout \u2013 scrappy way. Marr fires a few last questions that seem off the hoof: \u201cAre you going to meet Donald Trump this week?\u201d \u201cOf course I am.\u201d On Islamophobia, Boris Johnson is asked about candidates who are still in the Tory party, including one who has had multiple retweets of the far-right activist Tommy Robinson. \u201cThere is an independent process that needs to consider all such accusations of prejudice and we are ruthless about that. If people are convicted they are out,\u201d he replies Next, Marr reads out writings by Johnson in the Spectator shortly after the bombings of 7 July 2005, when he wrote: To any non-Muslim reader of the Qur\u2019an, Islamophobia \u2013 fear of Islam \u2013 seems a natural reaction, and, indeed, exactly what that text is intended to provoke. Judged purely on its scripture \u2013 to say nothing of what is preached in the mosques \u2013 it is the most viciously sectarian of all religions in its heartlessness towards unbelievers. His response to Marr is of the boilerplate type which he has deployed throughout the campaign and before when confronted by his past comments: \u201cPeople are always going to drag out bits an pieces of what I have said over the years to distract.\u201d He adds that he is proud to say that his great grandfather knew the Qur\u2019an off by heart. There\u2019s a personal cut from Marr who reminds Boris Johnson of his privileged access in to the past to libraries at Eton and elsewhere, while overseeing a situation now where libraries around Britain are struggling to stay open. He blames local authorities: \u201cI am afraid very often that local authorities.. some local authorities have been able to manage their finances so as to open libraries.\u201d He gives the example of his own borough where he says that the council has been able to open libraries. \u201cI love libraries and I want to see them properly used .. I want to invest in libraries but we can only do that when we get the economy really motoring but at the moment we have this huge drag.\u201d Wondering what needs to be done to get that drag taken care off? Yes, it\u2019s \u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d The Prime Minister goes on to insist that the party haven\u2019t just selected a range of candidates who have been \u201clobotomised.\u201d Johnson doesn\u2019t answer the question of whether he knows how many courts the Conservatives have closed since coming to power. Marry tells him: \u201cNearly 300 magistrates and crown courts have been closed by the Tories since they have been in power. An astonishing number.\u201d Johnson replies: \u201cNow is the time not just to make investment in the NHS but also in the justice system.\u201d Boris Johnson says there are 74 other individuals in the same situation as the London Bridge attacker - a convicted terrorist who was released early. What are the authorities doing about them? \u201cI don\u2019t want to go into the operational details. I am sure that people can imagine that what we are doing with the other 74 individuals is to ensure that they are being properly invigilated to ensure that there is no threat and we took that action because we were concerned.\u201d The Tories is putting \u201chuge sums\u201d into the NHS, the police and tackling terror, insists Boris Johnson as the interview descends into a scrappy affair. Does he have any regret for failing to invest in the probation service and for its privatisation? \u201cObviously I think should be investing more in the criminal justice system,\u201d says Johnson, who blames the last Labour government for leaving no money in the coffers. Liam Byrne\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m sorry - there is no money left\u2019 gets the obligatory mention. Marr accuses him of continuing to talk in order to avoid answering questions. \u201cAlthough it is very early,\u201d it is undeniable that the London Bridge attacker was out of prison on automatic early release, says Boris Johnson. The judges had no choice but to comply with the law which was introduced by Labour in 2008, adds Johnson, who is reminded by Andrew Marr that the Conservatives have been in power since 2010. Johnson continues to talk about Labour\u2019s \u201cearly release\u201d regime, with Marry pointing out that there was nothing in his party\u2019s election manifesto that would have changed the circumstances in which Usman Khan was released. Johnson says that he say the conditions which were attached to Khan\u2019s release but the problem was that he should have been in prison. \u201cBecause of changes to the law that were brought in by the Labour introduced... and which Jeremy Corbyn voted in favour off,\u201d he adds. His release was necessary under the law under the automatic release scheme with which he was sentenced, says Johnson, who adds that he is now going to take steps to change that as prime minister. Shami Chakrabarti says she \u201chopes\u201d the Labour in power would not have to build more prisons. \u201cI think there are too many people in prison who are not terrorists and who are there for minor offences, many of whom are women or there for substance abuse,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe have got overstuffed prisons and when you have overstuffed prisons the answer is not necessarily to build more.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Helen Pidd, who was on the Andrew Marr show earlier, has this nugget as we await Boris Johnson\u2019s appearance: Shami Chakrabarti, shadow attorney general, is being interviewed on Marr, where she\u2019s being asked about the London terror attacks. \u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d asks Andrew Marr, to which she replies \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Out of respect to the victims of the attack, their families and the views of the show, she says that she is not going to make pronouncements at this point about the process by which Usman Khan, the attacker, was released. She adds: \u201cI think it is very unedifying to be talked about knee-jerk legislation and throwing away the keys.\u201d Raab is being asked now about foreign policy and Nato and again goes on the offensive about past comments by Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cThe prime minister is a leading light both in terms of Nato defence spending but also operational support and Jeremy Corby has said that Nato should shut up shop and go away,\u201d says Raab. It\u2019s one of numerous reference to the Labour leader (at one point Ridge reminds Raab that the Tories have been in power for two decades and that he can\u2019t just keep on talking about past Labour policies in power) who is also attacked by the foreign secretary for his comments about the monarchy. \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy. We need to be respecting the institution of the royal family and if Jeremy Corbyn is saying that he wants to cut the size of the royal family,\u201d says Raab. \u201cI would like to know who he has in mind.\u201d Dominic Raab is being interviewed live now on Sophy Ridge and appears to have arrived ready to criticism Jeremy Corbyn for his past comments about shoot to kill policies The foreign secretary tells her that the major question in the election now is about the public\u2019s attitude to the leaders: \u201cDo they trust Boris Johnson to keep us safe of do they trust Jeremy Corbyn?\u201d Ridge goes on to produce a quotes from the father of one of those killed on London Bridge on Friday, who effectively said that he did not want his son\u2019s death to be used as a pretext for detaining people arbitrarily. David Merritt posted on Twitter: \u201cMy son, Jack, who was killed in this attack, would not wish his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people unnecessarily.\u201d Raab replies that it is the Conservatives who will \u201cstop at nothing\u201d to keep people safe. From this election, and previous polls, he doesn\u2019t think that anyone would consider the government\u2019s measures to protect the public as \u201cpoliticisation.\u201d Britain is on the brink of having a prime minister who is the most untruthful of all time, according to the Liberal Democrat deputy leader Ed Davey. Following Jeremy Corbyn on Sophy Ridge, Davey goes on the offensive against Boris Johnson for the prime minster\u2019s comments about the London bridge attack. \u201cWe should not, in the middle of a general election, mislead people,\u201d says Davey, who goes on to talk about sentencing powers for terror offenders which he says that his party strengthened in power. \u201cThe decision should not be taken by politicians. It should be taken by the parole board,\u201d says Davey, who states that the law was brought in to require that terrorists serve at least two thirds of their sentence. Johnson was either incompetent or misleading people, he adds. The interview closes with a last scoop. Corbyn says he will not \u2013 repeat, will not \u2013 be the new Arsenal manager. That nugget came after he was asked who he would like to see as the new manager of the club he supports, replying: \u201cPersonally I like Patrick Vieira, iconic player, brilliant guy and has done so much for education of children back home in Africa. I think Patrick Vieira.\u201d He adds: \u201cNo matter what happens, I will not be \u2026 No matter what happens in the election, I will not be the Arsenal manager but that might be good news for some people, whatever, but that\u2019s the situation.\u201d Corbyn says that he would question the size of the royal family and all that they do, as the interview moves on to his comment during a leaders\u2019 election programme on ITV in which he said that the monarchy needed \u201csome improvement\u201d. Corbyn now elaborates on that: \u201cWell I think the behaviour of individuals within the royal family is being looked at, shall we say? I do think the question of the size of the family and all that they do, but I do think the public as a whole would want to see those kind of changes and the debate around the behaviour of Prince Andrew has actually brought that to the fore.\u201d Corbyn is asked about polling recently which found that 87% of British Jews said they considered him to be an antisemite. This weekend the Sunday Telegraph is also publishing a poll, 84% of people saying he poses a threat to British Jews. The Labour leader responds: \u201cI pose no threat to any community whatsoever in this country. I\u2019ve spent my life fighting racism, fighting against racist attacks, fighting against \u2026\u201d Ridge presses: \u201cSo why do 87% of British Jews say they think you are antisemitic?\u201d Corbyn replies: \u201cI simply say this: there is no place anyway for antisemitism in our society ever.\u201d On antisemitism, Corbyn says that he wishes the party had acted more quickly and dealt with the issue at an earlier point. He adds: \u201cI want to make it very clear to the Jewish community, to the Muslim community and to any other community, anyone under threat because of persecution, because of attacks on their temples, mosques, synagogues or places of worship will be very secure under a Labour government.\u201d Asked whether he would vote in a new referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, Corbyn replies that he would, but declines to say what position he would back. He tells Ridge: \u201cI want to negotiate a deal with the European Union that does protect manufacturing industry, trade and jobs and does protect the trade relationship that we have with Europe because if we go down the road that the prime minister is taking us to with a sweetheart deal with the United States, there is going to be huge threats to industry all around the country but \u2026\u201d The interview moves on to the question of Nato and the organisation\u2019s summit, which is taking place this week in the UK. Corbyn is asked about past comments he made about the alliance. In 2011 he said: \u201cWe have got to be realistic that Nato is a major problem and a major difficulty and we have to campaign against Nato\u2019s power, its influence and its global reach because it\u2019s a danger to world peace and a danger to security.\u201d Would he be taking this message to Nato summits? \u201cWell what we\u2019d take to the Nato summit is this: that Nato was founded as a result of the second world war, it was a product of the strength of the cold war and I think we have to use all of the countries of Nato to try and build,\u201d Corbyn responds. Asked whether he has changed his mind on Nato, he responds: \u201cWe have to develop security around the world by bringing about a respectful relationship with Russia and other countries, but also we have to recognise the need to bring about peace where it is in danger such as in Iran or such as in Korea at the present time and that can be done by serious diplomatic negotiations.\u201d That use of the word \u201crespectful\u201d seems like an interesting one in the context of Britain\u2019s relationship with Russia, but there isn\u2019t time to develop it as the interview moves on to domestic issues. The interview moves on to the issue of shoot to kill \u2013 one that has landed Corbyn in some controversy before, when he said in 2015 that he was \u201cnot happy with the shoot to kill policy in general\u201d. The Conservatives are not being given any attack lines this time, however. Corbyn says that the police who shot dead the knife attacker on London Bridge on Friday had no choice. \u201cThey were stuck with a situation where there was a credible threat of a bomb belt around his body and it\u2019s an awful situation for any police officer, any public servant to be put in,\u201d he says. The Labour leader says the that the points he made in the past had been particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. \u201cThere was a concern in Northern Ireland that the police were adopting a shoot to kill policy when it was possible to arrest people rather than shoot them and that\u2019s my point,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere should never be the first alternative to shoot people, but if there is no other alternative then that\u2019s what you do.\u201d Corbyn expands on what Labour\u2019s approach would be: \u201cI think there has to be an examination of how our prison services work and crucially what happens to them on release from prison because I need to know whether or not the Parole Board were involved in his release, apparently they were not, they made that statement quite quickly after the release \u2026 after yesterday\u2019s terrible incident. [Note: the interview was pre-recorded.] \u201cSecondly, there was apparently no probation service involvement in monitoring this former prisoner who after all had only served half his sentence, and he came out I think a year ago and there has to be an examination of what goes on in the prison because prisons ought to be a place where people are put away because of major serious offences but also a place where rehabilitation takes place and I would like to \u2026\u201d Some clear blue water between the response of Corbyn and the prime minister to the attacks are opened up by the Labour leader\u2019s answer to the question of whether people convicted of terrorism offences should serve a full prison sentence. \u201cI think it depends on the circumstances, it depends on the sentence but crucially depends on what they\u2019ve done in prison,\u201d says Corbyn. Johnson reacted to the latest terrorist incident \u2013 in which three people died, including the assailant \u2013 by promising a package of hardline reforms which also included mandatory minimum 14-year sentences, an end to automatic early release for terrorist and extremism offences, and a new system under which those convicted will have to serve every day of sentences handed down by judges. Ridge presses: \u201cSo not necessarily then?\u201d to which Corbyn responds \u201cNo, not necessarily, no.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s interview with Ridge opens up with the question of his response to the London bridge attacks. The Labour leader says he was shocked by the attacks, adding: \u201cI do think that there are lessons that we have to learn from this and there has to be a very full investigation into the circumstances of the prison sentence that was served and the release from it and what services can do to help,\u201d Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live blog coverage of the general election campaign, which is currently overshadowed by the dreadful events at London Bridge on Friday. I\u2019m Ben Quinn \u2013 you can reach me on Twitter at @BenQuinn75 - and will be bringing you coverage of events today, including from the Sunday merry-go-round of political interview shows. They have key appearances by the two biggest beasts in the campaign. \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn is appearing at 8.30am on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge \u2022 Boris Johnson is appearing on the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, which starts at 9am. Corbyn\u2019s interview starts shortly and will devote, not surprisingly, significant time to the attack in London on Friday, as well as the Labour leader\u2019s views on foreign policy On the latter issue, he will warn today that Britain\u2019s repeated military interventions have \u201cexacerbated rather than resolved\u201d the problem of terrorism. The Labour leader will use a speech to warn that the so-called \u201cwar on terror has manifestly failed\u201d, adding that the world is \u201cliving with the consequences\u201d of the botched invasion of Iraq, which he opposed. The Observer reports that he will say that Britain risks being \u201ctied to Donald Trump\u2019s coat-tails\u201d and US foreign policy under Boris Johnson.",

      "bodyText": "Keaton Jennings is being considered for a surprise England recall in Sri Lanka in March in a move designed to counter the spinning conditions expected in the two-Test series. The 27-year-old has not played for England since a consolation victory over West Indies at St Lucia in February, when his struggle against the new ball on seaming pitches left him with an average of 25 from 17 Tests. This figure is a more healthy 44 on the subcontinent thanks to a proficiency against spin, the opener making 112 on debut against India in 2016 and an unbeaten 146 in Galle during England\u2019s 3-0 series win last year. England are minded to repeat as much as they can from that trip, with World Test Championship points on the line when they return to Galle and Colombo, giving Jennings a chance to be reunited with Rory Burns in a short-term move. Ben Foakes, whose impeccable glovework was another factor in the 2018 success (along with a century on debut), is another who will come into consideration even if he misses out as the back-up wicketkeeper for the next tour to South Africa. Jennings is notably the only capped batsman among the five taking part in an England spin training camp in Mumbai, with Will Jacks, Sam Hain, James Bracey and Dan Lawrence, who are all deemed long-term prospects. The three-week trip, which runs until 17 December and also features the bowlers Dom Bess, Mason Crane and Amar Virdi, includes sessions with Sri Lanka\u2019s now retired Rangana Herath, the all-time leading left-arm spinner with 433 Test wickets .

      "bodyText": "Here is Sid Lowe\u2019s match report ... A pretty brilliant game, decided by a pretty brilliant goal, from a pretty brilliant player. Diego Simeone\u2019s side will count themselves desperately hard done by because they had Barcelona on the ropes for the first half an hour. After that there was nothing to separate the two teams, other than that late flash of individual magic. But that\u2019s why he\u2019s the best in the world. That\u2019s all from me - thanks for reading! 93 mins: Free-kick to Atletico, given away by a desperate Messi slide tackle next to his own corner flag. Oblak trots up \u2013 and Trippier\u2019s delivery is headed his way, but Barcelona\u2019s 11-man defence heads clear before it gets there. And that it! 92 mins: Oblak sends the ball high into the Barca area, but it\u2019s headed out. There follows a round of pinball inside the area, and Koke\u2019s cross-shot is eventually saved. 90 mins: Three minutes of injury time. 89 mins: Barcelona are defending for their lives now, 11 men behind the ball, backs to the wall. An Atletico corner is half-cleared to Messi, who batters an aimless hoof high into the stands. Lovely to see. 85 mins: Messi is being funnelled down the right whenever he picks up the ball 86 mins: Messi picks up the ball in the inside-right channel and, for the first time this match, manages to jink inside his man. Approaching the edge of the box, he exchanges a crisp one-two with Suarez, and sweeps a first-time shot into the bottom corner. Simple but utterly brilliant. 82 mins: Messi tries to slide Junior in, but the pass gets away from him and goes out for a goal kick. Some changes: Vidal has come on for Arthur, and Lemar for Correa. And now Umtiti for Pique. 78 mins: Vitolo and Pique go screeching into a full-blooded 50/50, with the centre-back coming off worse. He rolls around for a long time, gets up, goes down again, rolls around, limps off the pitch, then limps gingerly back on. 76 mins: The Trippier/Morata combo clicks into gear again, the full-back bending a pass down the line and into his striker\u2019s path, who gets off a volley under pressure, but it\u2019s well over. 72 mins: Off the line! Correa hares into the box and fires in a low cross, which Morata meets with a backheeled flick \u2013 but Lenglet is waiting on to slice clear. 71 mins: Pique, already on a booking, goes sliding recklessly in on Morata, who\u2019s haring down the left, and gets nowhere near the ball, sending Morata sprawling to the ground. The referee takes a long hard look\u2026 and gives only a free-kick. Laughable! Gerard Pique you lucky man! 68 mins: Thomas spread the ball to the onrushing Trippier down the right, whose cross is blocked. The corner is half-cleared, sent back into the corridor of uncertainty \u2013 but no one can get a touch \u2013 before Barca spring a lightning break, Messi bustling through all sorts of fouls before laying off to Suarez, who chips square to Griezmann, who volleys wildly over. Vitolo is booked for the foul on Messi. 64 mins: All of a sudden the game has become wide open, another clearcut chance for Barcelona, Messi\u2019s side-foot effort saved after he meets De Jong\u2019s cutback, before Pique stretches desperately to prevent Joao Felix running clean through. Then Barca attack again, Suarez firing over. Joao Felix is taken off for Vitolo \u2013 not a change the home crowd approves of. 60 mins: Messi takes aim from 20 yards and rifles in a low drive, which Oblak gets down to before smothering the follow-up. 59 mins: De Jong picks up possession on halfway and sashays forward \u2013 and Griezmann is clean through in the inside-left if only he can pick him out! But he takes an age to spot the pass, and when he does he overhits it horribly, much to his teammate\u2019s anguish. 55 mins: Barca are turning the screw now \u2013 but then out of nothing, a brilliant counterattack from the hosts, Herrera stealing possession and sidestepping his way through a crowd in midfield before unleashing Morata down the left. He scoots forward, draws the defender, and squares to Thomas, but his shot is saved. This is one hell of a nil-nil. 53 mins: Messi prowls around the edge of the area, looking for an opening that isn\u2019t quite there. Eventually Morata steams back to dispossess him, and Atletico spring a counter down the right, cut short by a great sliding challenge from Lenglet. 48 mins: Barcelona are really dominating the ball now, but they can\u2019t get anywhere with it, with every pass into a dangerous area cut out, every dribble crowded out. Atletico are taking every opportunity to break quickly and in numbers. This may be how the second half will play out. 47 mins: Barcelona get us restarted with a bit of ball-hogging, before Griezmann unleashes from range, comfortably saved. Cue whistles. Anyway, we\u2019re back in action. Barcelona kick off. Re: the kit. It\u2019s not good, clearly. But by the standards of football kits, is it that bad? It\u2019s arguably not even the worst Barca kit, which for my money was this tequila-sunrise number a few years back: \u201cWhat is it with the design of this Barcelona alternate/third jersey?,\u201d asks Peter Oh. \u201cWere they going for a scratched-by-a-velociraptor look?\u201d (Also known as the Bob Peck?) Terrific half. Plenty of wonderfully assured play from both sides, and no shortage of chances all round. All that\u2019s missing is, well, a goal. 44 mins: The first glimpse of Messi\u2019s latent capacity to take out an entire team single-handedly \u2013 he dribbles around the edge of the box, encircled by defenders, but keeps the ball like a magnet. He plays it wide and looks for the return, but doesn\u2019t get it. Roberto\u2019s high cross comes to nothing. 42 mins: Barca hit the bar! Pique with the perfect mirror-image to the chance Morata had a minute before, meeting an outswinging corner. He heads the ball down, too, but it bounces up against the crossbar. 40 mins: Another phenomenal piece of goalkeeping from Ter Stegen, clawing away a header from Morata, who met a corner with a towering leap. He headed it powerfully downwards, and it bounced right in front of Ter Stegen, who readjusted brilliantly to scoop it away. 38 mins: Atletico are playing it out from the back with astounding calm, but here they lose the ball in midfield and a lovely bit of one-touch play from Barcelona sees Griezmann lay off to Suarez 25 yards out, and the Uruguayan unleashes a fearsome half-volley that flashes just wide. 35 mins: More brilliance from Arthur, wriggling away from Herrera and pinging a lovely ball up to Messi, who has two men to beat and can only win a corner, which he overhits wildly. 32 mins: Arthur, who is growing into the game, bursts forward and feeds Messi, who is tackled(!). Morata tries to break clear but is rugby tackled by Rakitic, who absurdly escapes a booking. Seconds later, Pique repeats the trick on Joao Felix, and does get a yellow. 29 mins: Barcelona have woken up. They play some of their old keep-ball, which comes to an end when Griezmann thunders into a slide tackle, to a deafening chorus of whistles. This is a high-class game. 26 mins: Great chance for Barcelona! They should be ahead, Messi nicking the ball off off a fast-asleep Herrera and squaring for the Croatian, but the pass forces him just away from goal and he can\u2019t quite get the purchase on the shot. Saved. 24 mins: More purposeful attacking from the hosts, who work the ball beautifully down the left but can\u2019t quite work a clearcut chance. Barca\u2019s counterattack is snuffed out instantly, and Atletico turn the screw again with Herrera bending one wide from just inside the box. They\u2019re all over Barcelona here. 22 mins: Atletico steal possession in the final third and have a great chance to spring a four-on-three attack, but Correa gets his pass all wrong. Will they come to regret these moments\u2026? 19 mins: Koke puts in the cross, cleared, but it comes back in to the back post where Joao Felix is waiting, practically underneath the crossbar, and has to score! He takes the volley with his side-foot, but it hits a star-jumping Ter Stegen on the inside of his thigh, trickles across the goal line and out for a corner. Unbelievable! 18 mins: Another free-kick to Atletico, this time right on the edge of the box, Junior wrestling Correa to the ground. 16 mins: Trippier whips in a beauty of a delivery, met aggressively by a rising Felipe whose header goes over. That could \u2013 should? \u2013 have been a goal. 16 mins: The teams are taking turns to keep the ball and slowly move forward. Atletico are doing more with the possession, though, and Trippier looks for Morata again with a cross, which is cleared, before winning a free-kick out wide. 12 mins: Barca enjoy their first sustained spell of possession, but they meet a brick wall each time they try any really penetrative passing. De Jong tries something different, running in behind from midfield, but he\u2019s eased away from the ball by a vigilant Hermoso. 9 mins: Atletico are on top here, and are getting joy down their right. He feeds a lovely pass into the box to Morata, who holds off Pique, swivels and fires in a shot that needs saving. Corner. 6 mins: Trippier picks out Correa down the right, who wins a corner. After a scrambled clearance, it breaks wide to Hermoso, and his driven cross hits first Lenglet and then the far post. That could have gone anywhere. 5 mins: Herrera intercepts a Suarez pass and stays ice-cool under pressure from De Jong to play it out from the back. Nice. But Barca are pressing with vigour. 3 mins: The stadium erupts in fierce whistles as Griezmann gets his first touch. No real rhythm to either side\u2019s play so far: it\u2019s been belting it down here, and the pitch it soaking. 1 min: And we\u2019re off. Thomas Partey belts it into the mixer, and Atletico win a series of throw-ins, ending when Morata tries a ludicrously hopeful long ranger that trickles wide. The teams are out. Handshakes are exchanged and the managers share a friendly hug. That\u2019s the niceties over with. So Antoine Griezmann starts \u2013 replacing the injured Ousmane Dembele \u2013 but with Ivan Rakitic coming in for the suspended Sergio Busquets, we have a Barcelona midfield with precisely none of the Xavi-Iniesta-Busquets trio that pretty much defined the club\u2019s previous decade and a half. Which isn\u2019t exactly new, but is still weird. An attacking lineup from Simeone, too, with both Joao Felix and Alvaro Morata up top \u2013 they\u2019ll fancy their chances against this Barca defence. But will Atletico look to take the game to the visitors (which is what Barcelona are least comfortable dealing with), or soak up the pressure and spring on the counter (which is what they are most comfortable doing)? Some pre-match reading, from Sid Lowe, on the strange riddle of Barcelona: Atletico Madrid: Oblak; Trippier, Hermoso, Felipe, Sa\u00fal; Correa, Herrera, Thomas, Koke; Joao F\u00e9lix, Morata Barcelona: Ter Stegen; Roberto, Lenglet, Piqu\u00e9, Junior Firpo; Rakitic, Arthur, De Jong; Messi, Su\u00e1rez, Griezmann Are Barcelona European football\u2019s weirdest team?

      "bodyText": "Facebook has banned a Conservative party campaign advert that used footage of the BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg and News at 10 host Huw Edwards, saying it violated the corporation\u2019s intellectual property rights. The clips, which were used without permission from the BBC, featured Kuenssberg saying the words \u201cpointless delay to Brexit\u201d, though she in fact appears to have been quoting Boris Johnson. Edwards is then shown talking about \u201canother Brexit delay\u201d followed by shaky footage of opposition leaders set to threatening music. On Sunday evening Huw Edwards praised the move by Facebook to ban the advert. He tweeted: \u201cGood. My thoughts on this kind of stunt are unprintable\u201d. A BBC spokesperson also said the corporation \u201cwelcomed the decision\u201d. On Thursday the BBC demanded that the paid-for advert, which targets older male voters, be taken down. \u201c This is a completely unacceptable use of BBC content which distorts our output and which could damage perceptions of our impartiality,\u201d they said. However, the Tories rejected the BBC\u2019s request, saying it was \u201cclear the footage was not edited in a manner that misleads or changes the reporting\u201d. In a statement on Sunday, Facebook said: \u201cWe have removed this content following a valid intellectual property claim from the rights holder, the BBC. Whenever we receive valid IP claims against content on the platform, in advertising or elsewhere, we act in accordance with our policies and take action as required.\u201d The advert ban came as the Conservatives face rising criticism for several controversial tactics used in this election campaign. During a televised election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn in November their press office temporarily rebranded on Twitter as a fact checker.",

Jackson finished with a team-high 101 yards on 16 carries, his fourth 100-yard game of the season. No previous NFL quarterback had ever rushed for 100 yards in more than three games in a single season.</p> <p>In the day\u2019s later kick-offs, the Chiefs, Broncos and Rams beat the Raiders, Chargers and Cardinals respectively</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/01/steelers-wear-free-pouncey-shirts-before-fiery-rematch-with-browns\">Steelers wear 'Free Pouncey' shirts before fiery rematch with Browns</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>New York Jets 6-22 Cincinnati Bengals</h2> <p>Andy Dalton returned from his three-week exile, and got a long-awaited win for the coach who benched him, throwing a touchdown pass during a 22-6 victory over the New York Jets that ended the longest losing streak in Cincinnati Bengals history.</p> <p>The Bengals (1-11) had lost 13 in a row since the end of last season, with newcomer Zac Taylor waiting until December to get his first head coaching win. Taylor benched Dalton after the eighth loss, deciding to see whether Ryan Finley fit into the team\u2019s long-term plans. Dalton led the NFL\u2019s lone winless team to the breakthrough victory in front of 39,804 fans, the lowest in the history of Paul Brown Stadium. The Jets (4-8) had their three-game winning streak snapped</p> <h2>Green Bay Packers 31-13 New York Giants</h2> <p>Aaron Rodgers threw four touchdown passes in the snow and the Green Bay Packers rebounded from a dismal performance in their last game to beat New York 31-13. The Packers sent the Giants to their eighth straight loss, their worst skid since 2004.</p> <p>Rodgers finished 21 of 33 for 243 yards with no interceptions on a slippery, snowy day at MetLife Stadium. Rodgers hit Davante Adams on touchdown passes of eight and 17 yards, found a wide-open Allen Lazard for 37 yards and capped the performance with a one-yarder to Marcedes Lewis. The Packers (9-3) also intercepted Giants rookie Daniel Jones three times, with the picks setting up 10 points.</p> <h2>Philadelphia Eagles 31-37 Miami Dolphins</h2> <p>DeVante Parker made two acrobatic touchdown receptions and kicker Jason Sanders also had a circus-like scoring catch to help the Miami Dolphins rally past the slumping Philadelphia Eagles.</p> <p>The Dolphins (3-9) won for the third time in their past five games, a surprising turnaround for a team that was built to lose in the hope of grabbing a high draft pick next year. The Eagles (5-7) lost their third game in a row and missed a chance to pull into a tie with Dallas atop the NFC East.</p> <p>Trickery helped the Dolphins, who twice opted not to kick on fourth down and instead threw for a touchdown. The second such gamble by rookie coach Brian Flores paid off when Miami shifted out of field goal formation before holder Matt Haack threw a one-yard pass to Sanders. Parker did much of the rest. He finished with seven receptions for a career-high 159 yards and two scores, both on leaping grabs.</p> <h2>Cleveland Browns 13-20 Pittsburgh Steelers</h2> <p>Devlin \u201cDuck\u201d Hodges and the Pittsburgh Steelers came back to beat the visiting Cleveland Browns 20-13.</p> <p>Hodges, an undrafted third-stringer who was given the start over Mason Rudolph, was 14-of-21 passing for 212 yards, an interception and a touchdown to James Washington (four catches, 111 yards) as Pittsburgh (7-5) erased a 10-0 deficit. Benny Snell added a touchdown run. Cleveland\u2019s Baker Mayfield passed for 196 yards, with a touchdown to Kareem Hunt and an interception. He was sacked five times. The Browns (5-7) had won three straight.</p> <h2>Tampa Bay Buccaneers 28-11 Jacksonville Jaguars</h2> <p>Nick Foles, Doug Marrone and the Jacksonville Jaguars reached a new low in their first home game in more than a month. Foles, who signed a four-year, $88m contract in free agency, ended his first three drives with turnovers that Tampa Bay turned into touchdowns, costly mistakes that propelled the Buccaneers to a 28-11 victory.</p> <p>It was Jacksonville\u2019s fourth consecutive loss by at least 17 points and could mean the end of Marrone\u2019s tenure with the team. At the very least, the skid will have owner Shad Khan considering changes over the final month of the season. Marrone, meanwhile, has to decide what to do at quarterback. He benched Foles at halftime, switching back to rookie sensation Gardner Minshew.</p> <h2>Tennessee Titans 31-17 Indianapolis Colts</h2> <p>Tye Smith returned a blocked field goal 63 yards to snap a fourth quarter tie, and Ryan Tannehill added his second touchdown pass two minutes later, as the visiting Tennessee Titans rallied Sunday for a 31-17 win over the Indianapolis Colts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1201241255524454400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BLOCK.

With the game tied at 17-17, Adam Vinatieri tried a 46-yard field goal to put Indianapolis ahead. But Dane Cruickshank surged through the right side to snuff the kick, and Smith sprinted untouched to the end zone with 5:02 left. It was the second field-goal attempt blocked by Tennessee in the game.</p> <h2>Washington 29-21 Carolina Panthers</h2> <p>Derrius Guice rushed for two touchdowns and Washington came up with a late goal-line stand in a 29-21 victory against the host Carolina Panthers.</p> <p>Washington (3-9) won for the second week in a row and they didn\u2019t allow a point for a 48-minute stretch until the game\u2019s final two minutes. Panthers quarterback Kyle Allen scrambled 17 yards for a touchdown with 1:51 remaining on a drive extended because of a fourth-down conversion. Carolina recovered the ensuing onside kick and reached the Washington one for a first down before running back Christian McCaffrey lost yards on consecutive plays, followed by an incomplete pass and a sack.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Justin Tucker drilled a 49-yard field goal on the final play of the game on Sunday afternoon, giving the Baltimore Ravens a 20-17 home victory over the San Francisco 49ers in a late-season battle of NFL titans. The win was the eighth in a row for the Ravens (10-2), leaders of the AFC North. San Francisco (10-2) lost for the second time in their past four games after an 8-0 start. Tucker\u2019s successful kick was his second of the day and his 38th straight in the fourth quarter of games in his career. The Ravens\u2019 final drive covered 34 yards in 12 plays, killing the final 6:28, and began after the 49ers failed on a fourth-and-one at the Baltimore 35 when Jimmy Garoppolo had a pass deflected at the line of scrimmage. Lamar Jackson kept the winning drive alive with a three-yard sneak on fourth-and-1 at Baltimore\u2019s 44. Jackson finished with a team-high 101 yards on 16 carries, his fourth 100-yard game of the season. No previous NFL quarterback had ever rushed for 100 yards in more than three games in a single season. In the day\u2019s later kick-offs, the Chiefs, Broncos and Rams beat the Raiders, Chargers and Cardinals respectively New York Jets 6-22 Cincinnati Bengals Andy Dalton returned from his three-week exile, and got a long-awaited win for the coach who benched him, throwing a touchdown pass during a 22-6 victory over the New York Jets that ended the longest losing streak in Cincinnati Bengals history. The Bengals (1-11) had lost 13 in a row since the end of last season, with newcomer Zac Taylor waiting until December to get his first head coaching win. Taylor benched Dalton after the eighth loss, deciding to see whether Ryan Finley fit into the team\u2019s long-term plans. Dalton led the NFL\u2019s lone winless team to the breakthrough victory in front of 39,804 fans, the lowest in the history of Paul Brown Stadium. The Jets (4-8) had their three-game winning streak snapped Green Bay Packers 31-13 New York Giants Aaron Rodgers threw four touchdown passes in the snow and the Green Bay Packers rebounded from a dismal performance in their last game to beat New York 31-13. The Packers sent the Giants to their eighth straight loss, their worst skid since 2004. Rodgers finished 21 of 33 for 243 yards with no interceptions on a slippery, snowy day at MetLife Stadium. Rodgers hit Davante Adams on touchdown passes of eight and 17 yards, found a wide-open Allen Lazard for 37 yards and capped the performance with a one-yarder to Marcedes Lewis. The Packers (9-3) also intercepted Giants rookie Daniel Jones three times, with the picks setting up 10 points. Philadelphia Eagles 31-37 Miami Dolphins DeVante Parker made two acrobatic touchdown receptions and kicker Jason Sanders also had a circus-like scoring catch to help the Miami Dolphins rally past the slumping Philadelphia Eagles. The Dolphins (3-9) won for the third time in their past five games, a surprising turnaround for a team that was built to lose in the hope of grabbing a high draft pick next year. The Eagles (5-7) lost their third game in a row and missed a chance to pull into a tie with Dallas atop the NFC East. Trickery helped the Dolphins, who twice opted not to kick on fourth down and instead threw for a touchdown. The second such gamble by rookie coach Brian Flores paid off when Miami shifted out of field goal formation before holder Matt Haack threw a one-yard pass to Sanders. Parker did much of the rest. He finished with seven receptions for a career-high 159 yards and two scores, both on leaping grabs. Cleveland Browns 13-20 Pittsburgh Steelers Devlin \u201cDuck\u201d Hodges and the Pittsburgh Steelers came back to beat the visiting Cleveland Browns 20-13. Hodges, an undrafted third-stringer who was given the start over Mason Rudolph, was 14-of-21 passing for 212 yards, an interception and a touchdown to James Washington (four catches, 111 yards) as Pittsburgh (7-5) erased a 10-0 deficit. Benny Snell added a touchdown run. Cleveland\u2019s Baker Mayfield passed for 196 yards, with a touchdown to Kareem Hunt and an interception. He was sacked five times. The Browns (5-7) had won three straight. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 28-11 Jacksonville Jaguars Nick Foles, Doug Marrone and the Jacksonville Jaguars reached a new low in their first home game in more than a month. Foles, who signed a four-year, $88m contract in free agency, ended his first three drives with turnovers that Tampa Bay turned into touchdowns, costly mistakes that propelled the Buccaneers to a 28-11 victory. It was Jacksonville\u2019s fourth consecutive loss by at least 17 points and could mean the end of Marrone\u2019s tenure with the team. At the very least, the skid will have owner Shad Khan considering changes over the final month of the season. Marrone, meanwhile, has to decide what to do at quarterback. He benched Foles at halftime, switching back to rookie sensation Gardner Minshew. Tennessee Titans 31-17 Indianapolis Colts Tye Smith returned a blocked field goal 63 yards to snap a fourth quarter tie, and Ryan Tannehill added his second touchdown pass two minutes later, as the visiting Tennessee Titans rallied Sunday for a 31-17 win over the Indianapolis Colts. Tennessee (7-5) won for the fifth time in six games, avenging a September home loss to the Colts (6-6). With the game tied at 17-17, Adam Vinatieri tried a 46-yard field goal to put Indianapolis ahead. But Dane Cruickshank surged through the right side to snuff the kick, and Smith sprinted untouched to the end zone with 5:02 left. It was the second field-goal attempt blocked by Tennessee in the game. Washington 29-21 Carolina Panthers Derrius Guice rushed for two touchdowns and Washington came up with a late goal-line stand in a 29-21 victory against the host Carolina Panthers. Washington (3-9) won for the second week in a row and they didn\u2019t allow a point for a 48-minute stretch until the game\u2019s final two minutes. Panthers quarterback Kyle Allen scrambled 17 yards for a touchdown with 1:51 remaining on a drive extended because of a fourth-down conversion. Carolina recovered the ensuing onside kick and reached the Washington one for a first down before running back Christian McCaffrey lost yards on consecutive plays, followed by an incomplete pass and a sack.",

Arsenal are hunting for a full-time manager after dismissing Unai Emery last week and Rodgers is prominent in their thinking.

It is also likely to prolong Yemen\u2019s inability to return to pre-crisis levels of hunger by 20 years just as famine conditions are improving. The warnings are partly directed at Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who are leading the fight against Houthi rebels as well as funding the bulk of humanitarian aid mainly going to UN agencies such as the World Food Programme (WFP). David Miliband, president of the IRC and former foreign secretary, said: \u201cToday\u2019s grim predictions are an insight into the colossal cost of the age of impunity: where wars are fought with a complete disregard for civilian life and neglected by diplomats charged with ending the violence and holding perpetrators of international law to account. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the war in Yemen has been prolonged by active military support and diplomatic cover from the US, UK, and other western powers. \u201cThe good news is that the huge efforts by humanitarian agencies, donor governments and aid workers have helped reduce slightly the appalling levels of child malnutrition in Yemen. \u201cThe bad news is that, at this rate, it will take a further 20 years just to reach prewar levels of child hunger. That\u2019s twice the agreed timetable for ending malnutrition around the world.\u201d The WFP is currently providing food aid to 12 million people in Yemen, and is set to undertake a new Yemen-wide survey of food insecurity. The report claims there are signs of diplomatic hope in Yemen for the first time since the Saudi intervention five years ago, including localised ceasefire proposals, prisoner releases and belated progress in implementing the December 2018 deal that brought warring parties together for the first time in two years. However, it also warns there are signs that an agreement brokered in the south of the country by Saudi Arabia last month is very fragile, as Houthi rebels appear to be ignoring key elements of the ceasefire agreement in the Red Sea port of Hodeidah and the WFP is battling to maintain control over the distribution of food from the rebels. It said the UK, critical to the peace process as it is leading on the issue at the UN security council, had allowed the diplomatic energy it has put into the issue to wane. \u201cIn recent months, distracted by turbulent national politics, the UK government has pulled back from their previously energetic engagement in the Yemen peace process \u2013 exemplified in the high-level push for the Stockholm agreement and the visit to Yemen by the former foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt.\u201d It said after this month\u2019s general election the UK must make peace in Yemen \u201cthe number one priority for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for 2020\u201d. With Saudi Arabia taking over the chairmanship of the G20 this month, climaxing with a summit next November in Riyadh, diplomats argue that the country\u2019s high profile provides a chance to place leverage on it to end the war within a year. Miliband\u2019s team propose the UK should publish a plan of action for 2020 to secure peace and address impediments to humanitarian access in Yemen in the first six weeks of any newly formed government. \u201cAny perceived absence in political engagement from the top in the UK would undermine the prospects of peace and the UK\u2019s reputation for foreign policy influence and conflict resolution,\u201d it said. The report suggests the UK should address the imbalance in its position on violations of international law in Yemen, and consistently release official statements of condemnation when civilians are killed or civilian infrastructure is destroyed by any party to the conflict.",

They are like some creature of myth, shapeshifting, ethereal, beyond the grasp of mortal perception. Every time you think you have worked them out, every time you think you know what they are and reach out towards them, they slip away. They are a team of the mist, intangible.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/01/leicester-everton-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester\u2019s Kelechi Iheanacho turns the screw on Everton\u2019s Marco Silva</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>They can dawdle through games as though entirely unconcerned by the result or their own reputations, or they can be as committed as they were at Leicester, snapping into tackles and diligently maintaining defensive shape.</p> \n<p>It was a performance that for three quarters of the game looked like earning them a win, for more than 90 minutes a point. It may have ended in defeat, following a VAR review that showed Kelechi Iheanacho was played onside by Yerry Mina\u2019s patella, but this was far removed from the limp display at home to Norwich the previous week.</p> \n<p>What it means is anyone\u2019s guess. Marco Silva will probably be in charge for Wednesday\u2019s Merseyside derby but after seven defeats in 10 league games there can be no guarantee Everton might record their first win at Anfield in 20 years and inflict Liverpool\u2019s first league defeat in 40 matches, or they might lose by a humiliating margin, or any point in between. To think you have worked out Everton is to misunderstand their true nature; they are unknowable.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e1f03660-5966-45ec-bb51-532da5869a53\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TP5LQPyzkk8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>They are a side who kept clean sheets in their opening two games of the season, which meant that, added to the end of last season, they had kept 10 clean sheets in 13 games. In that, it seemed, was the solid platform, on which Silva could build. They have not kept a clean sheet since.</p> \n<p>In part that is down to injuries. Jean-Philippe Gbamin, brought in to replace Idrissa Gana Gueye, who was perhaps underrated before his summer move to Paris Saint-Germain, has featured in only two games this season \u2013 those two clean sheets. Since then Everton have lost Andr\u00e9 Gomes and this weekend found themselves unable to start Morgan Schneiderlin and Fabian Delph. Midfield solidity is hard to achieve without solid midfielders.</p> \n<p>Silva\u2019s solution was to adopt a back three \u2013 the fourth time he has done so at Everton, always in away games in December. By and large it worked. Alex Iwobi has always looked more comfortable with a full-back overlapping him and that was the source of the opening goal as the former Arsenal forward released Djibril Sidib\u00e9 who, likewise, has always been better overlapping than sitting deep, and he crossed for Richarlison, perhaps the most mercurial of all Everton\u2019s unreliable talents, to thump home a header.</p> \n<p>Yes, they rode their luck when a penalty awarded for Mason Holgate\u2019s clumsy swipe at Ben Chilwell was overturned on the grounds that there was no contact, as though the full-back was somehow to blame for leaping out of the way, but Everton fundamentally looked comfortable. Gylfi Sigurdsson was assured in a much deeper position than usual and even Mina\u2019s eccentricities were disguised by having a player either side of him.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/01/brendan-rodgers-committed-leicester-arsenal-link-exit-clause\">Brendan Rodgers says he is committed to Leicester despite Arsenal link</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But the introduction of Iheanacho after 62 minutes and Leicester\u2019s switch from 4-1-4-1 to 4-4-2 changed the game. Did Everton run out of fitness? Were they culpable of failing to adjust to Leicester\u2019s change of shape? Or did proximity to a decent result addle their thinking? It was probably a bit of all three and, while they were certainly under pressure in the final minutes, in the end they will feel they got the rough end of a VAR call.</p> \n<p>Perhaps it is unfortunate that Mina has such protruding kneecaps but on the other hand, it is bewildering that Iheanacho could find such space in the centre of the pitch against a back three. Get that right and the pass would never have been on for Ricardo Pereira, who himself was able to surge curiously far without being challenged, and then the issue of offside would never have been raised.</p> \n<p>It is probably unfair to be too harsh after a change of shape forced by injuries but it was characteristic of the sort of laxity that keeps on costing Everton. Silva has come to seem an unlucky general but there are also times when he seems a curiously imprecise one.</p> \n<p>But then who has really got to grips with this most indefinable of clubs since David Moyes left in 2013. The sense of drift is such that it feels Silva\u2019s departure is inevitable sooner rather than later but Everton are a mystery that is not readily solvable.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is something deeply disconcerting about Everton. They are like some creature of myth, shapeshifting, ethereal, beyond the grasp of mortal perception. Every time you think you have worked them out, every time you think you know what they are and reach out towards them, they slip away. They are a team of the mist, intangible. They can dawdle through games as though entirely unconcerned by the result or their own reputations, or they can be as committed as they were at Leicester, snapping into tackles and diligently maintaining defensive shape. It was a performance that for three quarters of the game looked like earning them a win, for more than 90 minutes a point. It may have ended in defeat, following a VAR review that showed Kelechi Iheanacho was played onside by Yerry Mina\u2019s patella, but this was far removed from the limp display at home to Norwich the previous week. What it means is anyone\u2019s guess. Marco Silva will probably be in charge for Wednesday\u2019s Merseyside derby but after seven defeats in 10 league games there can be no guarantee Everton might record their first win at Anfield in 20 years and inflict Liverpool\u2019s first league defeat in 40 matches, or they might lose by a humiliating margin, or any point in between. To think you have worked out Everton is to misunderstand their true nature; they are unknowable. They are a side who kept clean sheets in their opening two games of the season, which meant that, added to the end of last season, they had kept 10 clean sheets in 13 games. In that, it seemed, was the solid platform, on which Silva could build. They have not kept a clean sheet since. In part that is down to injuries. Jean-Philippe Gbamin, brought in to replace Idrissa Gana Gueye, who was perhaps underrated before his summer move to Paris Saint-Germain, has featured in only two games this season \u2013 those two clean sheets. Since then Everton have lost Andr\u00e9 Gomes and this weekend found themselves unable to start Morgan Schneiderlin and Fabian Delph. Midfield solidity is hard to achieve without solid midfielders. Silva\u2019s solution was to adopt a back three \u2013 the fourth time he has done so at Everton, always in away games in December. By and large it worked. Alex Iwobi has always looked more comfortable with a full-back overlapping him and that was the source of the opening goal as the former Arsenal forward released Djibril Sidib\u00e9 who, likewise, has always been better overlapping than sitting deep, and he crossed for Richarlison, perhaps the most mercurial of all Everton\u2019s unreliable talents, to thump home a header. Yes, they rode their luck when a penalty awarded for Mason Holgate\u2019s clumsy swipe at Ben Chilwell was overturned on the grounds that there was no contact, as though the full-back was somehow to blame for leaping out of the way, but Everton fundamentally looked comfortable. Gylfi Sigurdsson was assured in a much deeper position than usual and even Mina\u2019s eccentricities were disguised by having a player either side of him. But the introduction of Iheanacho after 62 minutes and Leicester\u2019s switch from 4-1-4-1 to 4-4-2 changed the game. Did Everton run out of fitness? Were they culpable of failing to adjust to Leicester\u2019s change of shape? Or did proximity to a decent result addle their thinking? It was probably a bit of all three and, while they were certainly under pressure in the final minutes, in the end they will feel they got the rough end of a VAR call. Perhaps it is unfortunate that Mina has such protruding kneecaps but on the other hand, it is bewildering that Iheanacho could find such space in the centre of the pitch against a back three. Get that right and the pass would never have been on for Ricardo Pereira, who himself was able to surge curiously far without being challenged, and then the issue of offside would never have been raised. It is probably unfair to be too harsh after a change of shape forced by injuries but it was characteristic of the sort of laxity that keeps on costing Everton. Silva has come to seem an unlucky general but there are also times when he seems a curiously imprecise one. But then who has really got to grips with this most indefinable of clubs since David Moyes left in 2013. The sense of drift is such that it feels Silva\u2019s departure is inevitable sooner rather than later but Everton are a mystery that is not readily solvable.",

There was speculation at this time that he might succeed Simon Rattle at the Berlin Philharmonic, but Jansons made it clear that he intended to stay with the Bavarians. The reason he gave for deciding in favour of the latter was his vigorous involvement in the campaign for a new home. To abandon the orchestra in its long-fought struggle for a world-class concert hall in Munich \u201cwould be like betraying them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In February 2015 the city of Munich and state of Bavaria announced that there would be no new hall; rather, that the existing Gasteig concert hall (shared between the Bavarian RSO and the Munich Philharmonic), with its notoriously poor acoustics, would be renovated. But eventually plans were agreed for a new hall to be built in the east of the city, opening in 2024, and Jansons extended his contract with the orchestra until that year.</p> <p>The son of the distinguished conductor Arvid Jansons and his wife Erhaida \u2013 the singer Iraida Jansons \u2013 he was born in the Latvian capital of Riga during the second world war, while his Jewish mother was in hiding after being smuggled out of the Riga ghetto, where her father and brother were killed. Jansons began to study the violin with his father, and in 1957 entered the Leningrad Conservatory. There he also studied conducting with Nikolai Rabinovich, and made his conducting debut before graduating with honours.</p> <p>From 1969 to 1972 he studied conducting with Hans Swarowsky in Vienna and then with Von Karajan in Salzburg. Denied by the Soviet authorities the chance to continue working with Karajan, he was instead appointed associate conductor of the Leningrad Philharmonic, becoming associate principal conductor in 1985. In the same year he became guest conductor of what was then the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra, continuing until 1988.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbaGmqA9qkM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PbaGmqA9qkM?start=10&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=10\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Mariss Jansons conducting the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra in Tcahikovsky\u2019s Symphony No 1</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Meanwhile he had also taken the appointment with the Oslo Philharmonic, rapidly raising its status to international level. Under his charismatic leadership until 2002, the orchestra was invited to the Salzburg festival, the BBC Proms, Carnegie Hall, the Suntory Hall in Tokyo and other prestigious venues.</p> <p>Notable recordings made with the Oslo Philharmonic included the complete Tchaikovsky symphonies (including Manfred), which was praised as a leader of the field for its urgently spontaneous performances, with fresh orchestral sonorities enhanced by the richly atmospheric Chandos sound. They also recorded works by Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Grieg, Sibelius and Honegger, as well as an anthology of Russian and eastern European works for the orchestra\u2019s 75th anniversary.</p> <p>After his brush with mortality in 1996 \u2013 a second heart attack followed five weeks after the first \u2013 he was fitted with a defibrillator in his chest, designed to detect any irregularity in the heartbeat and adjust it with the appropriate voltage. (Jansons\u2019 father had died from a heart attack, in Manchester in 1984, while conducting the Hall\u00e9, of which he was principal guest conductor.) Maris Jansons\u2019 resignation in 2000 followed disputes with the city authorities about the poor acoustics of the Oslo concert hall.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1cbF3sQQc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PE1cbF3sQQc?start=22&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=22\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Mariss Jansons conducting the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra in Tchaikovsky\u2019s Symphony No 4</figcaption> </figure>   <p>With the St Petersburg Philharmonic (as it was renamed in 1991) he recorded the complete orchestral works of Rachmaninov, which were characterised by warmly idiomatic phrasing and powerful climaxes. During his seven-year tenure of the music directorship of the Pittsburgh Symphony, he was credited with transforming the orchestra\u2019s sound. The players also expressed satisfaction, after the years of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/jul/13/lorin-maazel\" title=\"\">Lorin Maazel</a>\u2019s soulless technical wizardry, that Jansons took the trouble to learn their names and made them think more deeply about the music they were playing. Players who had been wary of taking the lift if Maazel was in it were now more likely to mob their music director after rehearsals.</p> <p>Where Maazel was very precise about every detail, Jansons talked more about the mood he wished to create, without always giving precise instructions. Often during a concert, he would stop conducting altogether, forcing the orchestral players to listen to each other. He was also renowned for asking for the same passage to be played sometimes loud, sometimes soft, keeping the players on their toes with relish.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAtbAEdxJzM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WAtbAEdxJzM?start=68&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=68\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Mariss Jansons conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra\u2019s New Year\u2019s concert in 2006</figcaption> </figure>   <p>There were also disappointments in Pittsburgh, however: consistently low audience turnout and a projected $1m deficit in his last year. His plans for a music school for young gifted children were set aside, and he also drew a blank with his outreach efforts to schools. For one reason or another \u2013 and transatlantic commuting took its toll \u2013 Jansons spent only 10 weeks a year in Pittsburgh, using the rest of the time<strong> </strong>to maintain positions with the Oslo, London and St Petersburg Philharmonic orchestras.</p> <p>He also guest conducted other leading North American and European orchestras at this time, including the Chicago Symphony and Cleveland orchestras and the London Symphony Orchestra, with whom he recorded a fine Mahler Symphony No 6 for LSO Live. But it was with the Concertgebouw and Bavarian RSO that he was inspired to his greatest heights.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/aug/02/classicalmusicandopera.proms2004\" title=\"\">A visit to the BBC Proms with the latter in 2004</a> generated in Tchaikovsky\u2019s Path\u00e9tique Symphony a volcanic climax to the first movement, the claps of thunderous timpani seeming to emanate from the bowels of the earth. The virtuoso orchestral playing was heard to greatest effect in the velvet-clad military machine of the third movement march \u2013 which provoked a spontaneous, if premature, burst of applause from the audience, though the ultimate ovation, when it came, was more overwhelming still.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlmOqt3LRws\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YlmOqt3LRws?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Mariss Jansons conducting the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No 9</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/03/classicalmusicandopera.proms2005\" title=\"\">a 2005 Prom with the Concertgebouw</a>, Jansons mercilessly probed the tormented psyche given such powerful expression in Mahler\u2019s Sixth, again,<strong> </strong>with, in the opening movement, the tramp of a martial beat underfoot, the strings digging deep into their appoggiatura accents, the wind adding their own plangent punctuation. Above all, conductor and orchestra showed how the nerves and sinews could be exposed without any compromise of aesthetic quality.</p> <p>The following year he won a Grammy for best orchestral performance with the Bavarian orchestra and chorus for their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/12/classicalmusicandopera.shopping1\" title=\"\">recording of Shostakovich\u2019s Symphony No 13</a>. Also in 2006, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/feb/01/theatre3\" title=\"\">a visit to the Barbican</a> with the Concertgebouw resulted in a grandiloquent but never bombastic reading of Strauss\u2019s Ein Heldenleben, the hero\u2019s aura enhanced by the vivid presence conjured by the orchestra. While the strings were able to encompass both glassy brilliance and intense, throbbing passion, the woodwind could be languid or sensuous, the brass potent or exultant. Yet it was the final section, the tenderly, infinitely protracted pastoral idyll, that, one sensed, offered the inner truth of the work, for Jansons as for the composer.</p> <p>They were back at the Barbican in London in 2009 for a truly apocalyptic Mahler Resurrection Symphony, and again in 2012 for a searching account of Strauss\u2019s Also Sprach Zarathustra that encompassed doubt as well as affirmation.</p> <p>When Jansons finally felt obliged to give up the Amsterdam appointment in 2015, his unflagging energy and total commitment were acknowledged by the players: \u201cWe will all remember him for his detail, passion and immense musicality and knowledge,\u201d one said. \u201cThere is nothing in every score he conducts that he hasn\u2019t read, researched, discussed, thought about and worried about.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MCggJhtLjI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6MCggJhtLjI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Mariss Jansons conducting the Bavarian RSO in the concluding part of the finale of Mahler\u2019s Symphony No 9</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As in Oslo and Pittsburgh, Jansons was credited with transforming the sound of the Dutch orchestra, in this case muting the brightness cultivated by his predecessor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/riccardo-chailly\" title=\"\">Riccardo Chailly</a> and restoring the warmth and depth with which it had traditionally been associated.</p> <p>In 2016 he conducted the Vienna Philharmonic\u2019s New Year\u2019s concert for the third time.

Meanwhile he had also taken the appointment with the Oslo Philharmonic, rapidly raising its status to international level. Under his charismatic leadership until 2002, the orchestra was invited to the Salzburg festival, the BBC Proms, Carnegie Hall, the Suntory Hall in Tokyo and other prestigious venues. Notable recordings made with the Oslo Philharmonic included the complete Tchaikovsky symphonies (including Manfred), which was praised as a leader of the field for its urgently spontaneous performances, with fresh orchestral sonorities enhanced by the richly atmospheric Chandos sound. They also recorded works by Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Grieg, Sibelius and Honegger, as well as an anthology of Russian and eastern European works for the orchestra\u2019s 75th anniversary. After his brush with mortality in 1996 \u2013 a second heart attack followed five weeks after the first \u2013 he was fitted with a defibrillator in his chest, designed to detect any irregularity in the heartbeat and adjust it with the appropriate voltage. (Jansons\u2019 father had died from a heart attack, in Manchester in 1984, while conducting the Hall\u00e9, of which he was principal guest conductor.) Maris Jansons\u2019 resignation in 2000 followed disputes with the city authorities about the poor acoustics of the Oslo concert hall. With the St Petersburg Philharmonic (as it was renamed in 1991) he recorded the complete orchestral works of Rachmaninov, which were characterised by warmly idiomatic phrasing and powerful climaxes. During his seven-year tenure of the music directorship of the Pittsburgh Symphony, he was credited with transforming the orchestra\u2019s sound. The players also expressed satisfaction, after the years of Lorin Maazel\u2019s soulless technical wizardry, that Jansons took the trouble to learn their names and made them think more deeply about the music they were playing. Players who had been wary of taking the lift if Maazel was in it were now more likely to mob their music director after rehearsals. Where Maazel was very precise about every detail, Jansons talked more about the mood he wished to create, without always giving precise instructions. Often during a concert, he would stop conducting altogether, forcing the orchestral players to listen to each other. He was also renowned for asking for the same passage to be played sometimes loud, sometimes soft, keeping the players on their toes with relish. There were also disappointments in Pittsburgh, however: consistently low audience turnout and a projected $1m deficit in his last year. His plans for a music school for young gifted children were set aside, and he also drew a blank with his outreach efforts to schools. For one reason or another \u2013 and transatlantic commuting took its toll \u2013 Jansons spent only 10 weeks a year in Pittsburgh, using the rest of the time to maintain positions with the Oslo, London and St Petersburg Philharmonic orchestras. He also guest conducted other leading North American and European orchestras at this time, including the Chicago Symphony and Cleveland orchestras and the London Symphony Orchestra, with whom he recorded a fine Mahler Symphony No 6 for LSO Live. But it was with the Concertgebouw and Bavarian RSO that he was inspired to his greatest heights. A visit to the BBC Proms with the latter in 2004 generated in Tchaikovsky\u2019s Path\u00e9tique Symphony a volcanic climax to the first movement, the claps of thunderous timpani seeming to emanate from the bowels of the earth. The virtuoso orchestral playing was heard to greatest effect in the velvet-clad military machine of the third movement march \u2013 which provoked a spontaneous, if premature, burst of applause from the audience, though the ultimate ovation, when it came, was more overwhelming still. In a 2005 Prom with the Concertgebouw, Jansons mercilessly probed the tormented psyche given such powerful expression in Mahler\u2019s Sixth, again, with, in the opening movement, the tramp of a martial beat underfoot, the strings digging deep into their appoggiatura accents, the wind adding their own plangent punctuation. Above all, conductor and orchestra showed how the nerves and sinews could be exposed without any compromise of aesthetic quality. The following year he won a Grammy for best orchestral performance with the Bavarian orchestra and chorus for their recording of Shostakovich\u2019s Symphony No 13. Also in 2006, a visit to the Barbican with the Concertgebouw resulted in a grandiloquent but never bombastic reading of Strauss\u2019s Ein Heldenleben, the hero\u2019s aura enhanced by the vivid presence conjured by the orchestra. While the strings were able to encompass both glassy brilliance and intense, throbbing passion, the woodwind could be languid or sensuous, the brass potent or exultant. Yet it was the final section, the tenderly, infinitely protracted pastoral idyll, that, one sensed, offered the inner truth of the work, for Jansons as for the composer. They were back at the Barbican in London in 2009 for a truly apocalyptic Mahler Resurrection Symphony, and again in 2012 for a searching account of Strauss\u2019s Also Sprach Zarathustra that encompassed doubt as well as affirmation. When Jansons finally felt obliged to give up the Amsterdam appointment in 2015, his unflagging energy and total commitment were acknowledged by the players: \u201cWe will all remember him for his detail, passion and immense musicality and knowledge,\u201d one said. \u201cThere is nothing in every score he conducts that he hasn\u2019t read, researched, discussed, thought about and worried about.\u201d As in Oslo and Pittsburgh, Jansons was credited with transforming the sound of the Dutch orchestra, in this case muting the brightness cultivated by his predecessor Riccardo Chailly and restoring the warmth and depth with which it had traditionally been associated. In 2016 he conducted the Vienna Philharmonic\u2019s New Year\u2019s concert for the third time. At the start of this year he gave another striking account in London of Ein Heldenleben, this time with the Bavarians. This summer he took a break from conducting on doctor\u2019s orders, but was back in action in Munich in the autumn. Players in all the orchestras he conducted had difficulty matching his energy levels, but Jansons drove himself in the belief that he had not reached his peak, that there was still more to learn. It was perhaps that unflagging commitment, combined with his search for truth, that made him the outstanding conductor he was. He is survived by his second wife, Irina (nee Outchitel), whom he married in 1967, and by his daughter, Ilona, a pianist, from his first marriage. \u2022 Mariss Ivars Georgs Jansons, conductor, born 14 Jan 1943; died 30 November 2019 \u2022 This article was amended on 2 December 2019. The outcome of plans for an improved concert hall in Munich is that a new one will be built in the east of the city, opening in 2024.",

      "bodyText": "Well on that bombshell, it\u2019s all over for another week \u2013 get ready for a MASSIVE SEMI next week, when our four remaining couples will be dancing TWO DANCES; kick-off is at 7pm, so please join me then. Thank you all for joining in; you are the chorus line every liveblogger needs, and let\u2019s face it you\u2019ve been making me look good for years. See you next week! We get to see Alex and Neil\u2019s best bits, and they both say lovely things about each other as it all gets a bit emotional. They take to the floor for their final dance, to Circle Of Life from The Lion King. Which means ALEX AND NEIL are leaving Strictly. I\u2019m sad about this, but much as I think \u2018gospel hiphop samba\u2019 should be a dance genre we ALL embrace in future, it was pretty risky for the quarter final. So how will the judges vote? Craig saves Alex and Neil, as does Motsi. Good work both. Bruno saves Chris and Karen, however, which gives Shirley the deciding vote. Shirley saves Chris and Karen, based on \u2018personal taste\u2019 \u2013 she thought their dance had more content and was more entertaining. I mean it definitely had content, it just wasn\u2019t FOXTROT content. FFS Shirley. Alex and Neil are up next \u2013 it\u2019s definitely could have done with more Samba content, but Alex actually dances this really well. I\u2019m not sure she can blamed for the lack of Samba, she didn\u2019t choreograph it. If it were me, based on that dance, I\u2019d keep Alex and Neil over Chris and Karen. Dance-off time! First up it\u2019s Chris and Karen, and their \u2018Foxtrot\u2019. This is much like last night, other than the timing is worse and the bits in hold are even more lethargic. Not a great performance, and it may well finish Chris off. Well, this is interesting \u2013 a battle of the non-dancers doing dances with limited relevant content. Alex and Neil scored one point fewer last night, but I\u2019d argue they\u2019ve made more progress overall this series. It really is going to come down to this one dance \u2013 personally I\u2019d love to see Alex and Neil stay, but I know there are plenty out there who are very much team Chris and Karen. So who is joining Chris and Karen in the dance off? Kelvin and Oti are safe, which means ALEX AND NEIL are in the bottom two. Next week is TWO DANCES. Farewell technique, we barely knew you. Loving Idina\u2019s red pantsuit, it\u2019s fabulous. Dance-wise, Idina is accompanied by Giovanni and Karen contempo-wafting, but only Karen is barefoot. Brr. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Idina Menzel. For those of you who have been on a different planet these last few years, Idina is the voice of Elsa from Frozen. Tonight she is singing \u2018Seasons Of Love\u2019 from Rent, and also her new festive album. So will this reflect tonight\u2019s bottom two? Karim and Amy are safe, along with Emma and Anton. First couple in the bottom two: CHRIS AND KAREN. If they\u2019re up against Kelvin and Oti, they\u2019re toast. If it\u2019s Alex and Neil, it could go either way. Meanwhile lowlights were Chris and Karen\u2019s Oliver! Foxtrot, which looked fun but lacked actual Foxtrot, and Alex and Neil\u2019s Sister Act 2 Samba which was joyful joyful to watch but was a bit hiphop heavy and Samba lite. Last night on Strictly: Musicals Week! I\u2019ve watched all the dances again this morning (with both eyes, such a novelty!) \u2013 highlights were Kelvin and Oti\u2019s Beauty and The Beast American Smooth, which was pure Gaston perfection, Karim and Amy\u2019s Hairspray Jive, which got Craig\u2019s first ten out, and Emma and Anton\u2019s Throughly Modern Millie Charleston, which was their best dance by far despite Anton not really keeping up. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a derelict post box, Claudia in a black velvet sack. Don\u2019t forget your letters to Santa. Dance-wise, it\u2019s midnight blue organza contempo-waft. But not barefoot, winter has finally arrived. This is splendid. And we\u2019re off! Tonight\u2019s musical opener is Beverley Knight, singing Memory from Cats. Based on Facebook photos, it would seem I have an uncle who is good friends with Beverley Knight. I\u2019ve never properly got to the bottom of this family link but probably should, because she is amazing. Missed the Countryfile Casual Weather earlier, but the comments tell me that it was a solid effort from the excellent Darren Bett. Good work Darren, you can come to our Strictly Casual Christmas party. Evening all, and welcome back for this week\u2019s quarter final results! Last night was a fun show, but if we\u2019re ever going to make it to Christmas we need to send another couple off into the Strictly sunset. I don\u2019t make the rules. Based on last night\u2019s dancing, it should be a Chris/Karen vs. Alex/Neil dance-off, but we can\u2019t underestimate the power of the public vote, particularly where Chris is concerned. Of course there were a few other factors at play last last night, like not being able to vote, being able to vote 412 times, not being sure if you\u2019d actually voted, and having no idea who you\u2019d actually voted for. LOVE a bit of live TV voting chaos. Kick off is at 7.20pm \u2013 I see there were some spoilers down below which the moderators had removed by the time I woke up this morning. Can people please not do this? It\u2019s selfish and inconsiderate and makes me cross. See you in a bit! Thanks so much for joining in tonight and being hilarious down below as always \u2013 I\u2019m off to eat pizza whilst reading your comments. We\u2019re back here tomorrow night from 7.20pm for the Results Show, so please join me back here then! Hx *CURTAIN FALLS, HOUSE LIGHTS GO UP* Goodness, the dancing\u2019s over! That was quick. The lines are open, so get voting for your faves. Kelvin, Karim and Emma are very much centre stage this week, whilst Alex and Chris are propping up the chorus. Surely those two have to be in the dance off tomorrow? Time for a recap \u2013 my favourite performances this evening was definitely Kelvin and Oti, but it was a pretty epic show all round. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Emma and Anton. The tens have gone WILD this evening. Shirley thought Emma fast-tracked her way to the final \u2013 it was fantastic. Bruno liked that it was a genuine 1920\u2019s Charleston, Emma was a perfect high-class flapper. Craig loved the swivel \u2013 it was classic, classy and fab-u-lous. Motsi thought Emma was the icing on the top of a fantastic evening. Good to see the Flavia wig having an outing, it\u2019s been in its tiny cage too long. Emma has great swivel and characterisation in this dance, it could be strongly argued that she\u2019s out-dancing Anton right now. I absolutely loathe this kind of musical number, but Emma is smashing it. Enjoyed that very much. And finally tonight it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON! This week they\u2019re dancing the Charleston to \u2018Thoroughly Modern Millie\u2019, which is the only musical in this year\u2019s clutch that I haven\u2019t seen on either stage or screen. Having watched a bit on YouTube, it seems to be heavy Jazz Hands, which is definitely Emma and Anton\u2019s happy place. Scores: 10,10,10,10 \u2013 a top score of 40 for Karim and Amy. DRINK. Motsi hands Karim her ten paddle and gives him a hug. Shirley thought it was a flawless performance with high quality technique. Bruno has shivers going down his spine \u2013 it was a mind-blowing, bravura performance and the best Jive they\u2019ve ever seen on Strictly. Craig is forced to give a standing ovation \u2013 tens all round? Karim is rocking the Corny Collins white suit, whilst Amy has a kind of fringy chessboard thing going on, along with weird hair horns. Karim is very much in his element here, some nice kicks and flicks and lovely timing. Is is (as ever) all a bit frantic, but an extraordinary Jive by any standards. I think my biggest issue with this couple is the lack of chemistry \u2013 Karim looks like he\u2019s doing his own thing and Amy is just making up the numbers. Just me? Next up it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! Their Musicals Week choice is a Jive to \u2018You Can\u2019t Stop the Beat\u2019 from Hairspray. How has Karim got this far without doing a Jive? This kind of technical detail dance is very Karim, so have high hopes for this after last week\u2019s angsty Couple\u2019s Choice. For those of you reading but not watching, sorry for the lack of photos so far, they don\u2019t appear to be on the system yet. I\u2019ll add them as soon as I can. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Kelvin and Oti. Craig thought the timing in the Viennese section was a bit off, but fantastic characterisation and a brilliant dance. Motsi thought we saw all of Kelvin\u2019s skills come together, it was beautiful and elegant and Kelvin did a great job. Shirley thought it was outstanding on so many levels, and she absolutely disagrees with Craig on the timing. Bruno thought Kelvin had flair, pizzazz and a touch of camp \u2013 the character, storytelling and timing were perfect. Kelvin looks oddly like Howard Donald from Take That, I can\u2019t get past it. There is however lots of furniture in this dance, so DRINK. Lovely footwork from Kelvin, and he\u2019s doing a great job of capturing the spirit of Gaston. This has got all kinds going on, and I absolutely love it. AGAIN. It\u2019s time for KELVIN AND OTI! This week they\u2019re dancing the American Smooth to \u2018Gaston\u2019 from Beauty and the Beast. I mean, Kelvin is just a pair of sideburns away from being actual Gaston, so this is an amazing choice. Please let this be as spectacularly camp as the original. Scores: 6,7,7,7 \u2013 a total of 27 for Alex and Neil. Bruno thought it was a street/commercial Samba, and it didn\u2019t have the right bounce in the traditional Samba sections, so Bruno can\u2019t really judge them on that. Craig quite likes weird positions and really enjoyed it, whilst Motsi thought they were having the time of their life, even thought she wanted more Samba. Shirley loved the personality from the waist upwards, but there was too much repetition and not enough Samba. In summary: not enough Samba. Sadly neither Alex or Neil are dressed as nuns, but there are some nice purple robes going one. Oh hang on, they\u2019ve gone \u2013 now Alex is ready for a spot of decorating and somebody from 1983 appears to have been sick on Neil\u2019s shirt. Alex is doing her best to give this some Samba bounce, but the trainers are hampering her frame and her neck appears to have disappeared. This is also a hip-hop Samba with very little Latin flavour, and whilst Alex appears to be having the time of her life, I\u2019m a bit worried for them after that. Next (in the slot of Samba death) it\u2019s ALEX AND NEIL! This week they\u2019re dancing the Samba to \u2018Joyful Joyful\u2019 from Sister Act. I\u2019m both intrigued and a tiny bit worried about how a gospel classic is going to work as a Samba, and after last week\u2019s Argentine Tangle Alex could really do with a showstopper. Fingers crossed, but hopefully not Alex\u2019s feet. Reading tonight\u2019s Terms &amp; Conditions: celebrity choirmaster/Harry Potter impersonator Gareth Malone. Scores: 6,7,8,7 \u2013 a total of 28 for Chris and Karen. Common sense finally prevails. Shirley loved the theatrical bits, but in hold it needed more swing. Bruno loved how the Artful Dodger put on a show, but the Foxtrot felt like intermissions between musical theatre acts, and needed to be more refined. Craig thought it lacked movement around the floor and the Foxtrot was too carefully placed, but the characterisation was fantastic. Motsi thought the open parts were fantastic, but she\u2019s not going to mention the tiny bit Foxtrot she saw. Huge marks all round then? So this looks great in the \u2018cor blimey guvnor\u2019 solo bits, but once Chris is in hold he looks a bit stiff and constipated, all the flow disappears. Not a huge amount of actual Foxtrot either, but hey ho. First up tonight it\u2019s CHRIS AND KAREN! This week they\u2019re dancing the Foxtrot to \u2018Consider Yourself\u2019 from Oliver! Who doesn\u2019t love a bit of Lionel Bart? I feel like Chris is going to embrace the role of Dickensian workhouse ruffian with some enthusiasm. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH! Tess in rainbow tinsel, Claudia in a silver chandelier. They both look spectacular. Haha only kidding, it\u2019s a hot mess all round. We open with a bonus Feem Week pro dance, which has a Hello Dolly thing going on. As someone who briefly went to a school that had straw boaters (don\u2019t ask), I can confirm that they smell terrible. Oh lord, Anton and Kevin are leading the singing. Very much here for Craig singing in spectacular drag, however. Give the 189 a paper bag to breathe into, we\u2019re raising the bar every week. And we\u2019re off! It\u2019s the quarter final, so our five remaining couples are expressing their angst in shadow form, like some kind of neon Tales Of The Unexpected. Bit weird. You\u2019d think it would be quite tough to make a prime time pop music quiz on BBC truly terrible, but this one really nails it. This week\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo \u2013 have a swig of warm interval wine (please place your order at the bar now) for any occurrence of the following: Household furniture Craig getting his ten out Pyrotechnics Tess being patronising Early mentions of TWO DANCES Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing liveblog! We\u2019ve made it Week 11, which means three things: It\u2019s Musicals Week! Prepare yourself for jazz hands, rictus grins, insane props and squashed-in superfluous backing dancers. Hold me closer tiny dancefloor. It\u2019s also the quarter finals! When this season started we were enjoying the sunshine and quietly stockpiling pesto, blissfully unaware that by Week 11 we\u2019d be stuck in a revolving news hell with Pinocchio politicians and pervy princes. Thank goodness for Strictly. The show is less than an hour long! It\u2019s the shortest show of the series, before we move to TWO DANCES next week. After those 2 hour 20 minute liveblog marathons in the early weeks, this is going to be a breeze. Heidi\u2019s Hunches has been pretty poor so far this season, but we\u2019ve come this far so I will doggedly plod on. I have no choice but to put Chris and Karen in the top group, as the judges and public seems to love him \u2013 also Alex and Neil have a Cursed Samba this evening which may well finish them off. Group 1: one eye on the final \u2013 Kelvin and Oti, Chris and Karen, Karim and Amy Group 4: dodging the dance-off \u2013 Emma and Anton, Alex and Neil Curtain up is at 7.10pm, so gather appropriate snacks/drink/blankets/loved ones and settle in! See you in a bit.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 2 December. Top stories Jacqui Lambie will meet with Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton on Monday to discuss the medevac repeal. After outlining a non-negotiable \u2013 but undisclosed \u2013 condition for securing her support, Lambie told Guardian Australia the government was prepared to discuss her demand, saying the \u201cdoor is wide open\u201d. While the key crossbencher has refused to disclose details of her ultimatum, saying it relates to issues of national security, it has been reported she wants the Coalition to accept the offer from New Zealand to take 150 refugees from offshore detention. Lambie has not denied the report. The second victim of the London Bridge terror attack has been named as Saskia Jones, 23, a former Cambridge student. Jones was named a day after Jack Merritt, 25, was identified by his father as the other person killed by Usman Khan in his knife attack at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall on Friday. Khan was attending an event for the Learning Together initiative when he began the attack. Academics and former staff at a prison-based education project have voiced support for the initiative, saying its message should not be undermined. Detained Australian writer Dr Yang Hengjun is being subjected to daily interrogations with his arms and legs shackled, as Chinese security officials try to \u201cbreak\u201d him, his lawyers say, pushing for him to confess to unspecified allegations of espionage that potentially carry the death penalty. Yang, an Australian citizen and globally influential pro-democracy political blogger, has been held by China\u2019s Ministry of State Security since being detained in Guangzhou in January. Australia Freed Taliban hostage Timothy Weeks says he never gave up hope he would be rescued during his three years in captivity in Afghanistan. Speaking publicly for the first time since his release as part of a complex prisoner swap almost two weeks ago, the Australian teacher thanked those who helped secure his freedom, and said he had formed extraordinarily tight bonds with some of his Taliban captors. Federal parliament will debate a call for the return of countless thousands of looted Aboriginal artefacts, many of which remain in the British Museum. Australia\u2019s carbon emissions would be more than 200m tonnes lower if the Greens had supported the carbon pollution reduction scheme a decade ago, says Labor frontbencher Pat Conroy. The Westpac scandal highlights the problems Australian institutions have with detecting and reporting dodgy transactions. The allegations have also provoked concerns about the ability of the big banks to comply with the law. The world Legal storm clouds are gathering over Rudy Giuliani, America\u2019s tarnished mayor. Analysts say an indictment is likely as prosecutors focus on Giuliani\u2019s work for Trump and himself in Ukraine. The future of Angela Merkel\u2019s government is in doubt after her junior coalition partners the Social Democrats elected a new leftwing leadership duo who have pledged to renegotiate the terms of the alliance. The gang rape of a veterinary doctor whose body was set on fire and dumped under a bridge has sent shockwaves through India, with hundreds of women taking to the streets in protest. Iran has warned it may \u201cseriously reconsider\u201d its commitments to the UN atomic watchdog if European parties to a nuclear deal trigger a dispute mechanism that could lead to fresh sanctions.

      "bodyText": "Investigators believe Usman Khan could have got the materials for his attack on London Bridge as little as 24 hours before he struck, as MI5 began an inquiry into how a suspect who was under \u201cactive investigation\u201d managed to kill. Khan, 28, is believed by investigators to have acted alone when he stabbed two people to death while wearing a fake suicide bomb belt he is thought to have made. An urgent investigation by MI5 and Scotland Yard counter-terrorism command believes he hatched his plot without help from anyone else. He was convicted in 2012 of a terror plot and freed halfway through his sentence in December 2018. Six of those convicted with him who have been released from jail have been urgently examined since Friday\u2019s attack in case the dangers they pose may have been underestimated. On Sunday, police said a 34-year-old who had been convicted with Khan was arrested, \u201cin connection to a wider ongoing review of existing licence conditions of convicted terrorism offenders\u201d. His home was searched and he was arrested on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts. He has since been recalled to prison due to a suspected breach of his licence conditions. Police said they did not believe he was connected to the London Bridge attack. Hundreds more suspects, unconnected to Khan, are also being reexamined to check that no warning signs have been missed, after the first attack in Britain to claim a life since 2017. Khan is only the second suspect under active investigation by MI5 who has gone on to kill \u2013 the first was the ringleader of the 2017 attack on London Bridge, Khuram Butt. A Whitehall source told the Guardian: \u201cKhan was under active investigation. There was nothing in his behaviour to provoke undue concern.\u201d Khan was a priority 3 suspect, the same as other prisoners released after being imprisoned for serious terrorism offences. Khan\u2019s terms of release meant there were conditions restricting his communications and he was, for instance, not allowed to have a smartphone to access the internet. He was on MI5\u2019s list of 3,000 suspects under active investigation, and so called \u201ctrip wires\u201d were in place if he showed alarming behaviour. The Whitehall source confirmed Khan was not assessed as posing a danger of planning an attack, and was subjected to limited monitoring by MI5. \u201cResources are deployed proportionate to the information we have on people. Given the dozens of people involved or associated with plots to attack the UK, resources are deployed there. He fell well below that place.\u201d The threat from Islamist terrorism and the volume of work that generates for counter-terrorism investigators had dropped slightly recently, but is still well above the levels in 2015, before the rise of Isis and its social media propaganda inciting attacks led the threat to leap. Friday\u2019s incident has echoes of the 2017 attack on London Bridge. Khan and Butt both strapped knives to their wrists and also constructed fake bomb belts. Both had been close to the al-Muhajiroun group, whose spokesperson was jailed Islamic State supporter Anjem Choudar, but had moved away. Khan was moving away from al-Muhajiroun even before his arrest in 2010 for terrorism, with the group still adhering to a \u201ccovenant of security\u201d \u2013 meaning its adherents should not actively support attacks against the UK, investigators believe. The Whitehall source dismissed an Isis claim that it was behind the attack, but said the group\u2019s influence via its propaganda and past attacks remains: \u201cLow sophistication attacks are difficult to stop and get a lot of attention.\u201d All those injured or killed in Friday\u2019s attack were stabbed at a meeting on the rehabilitation of prisoners organised by the charity Learning Together held at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall, close to London Bridge. Khan is believed to have travelled from his bedsit in Stafford, where he lived alone, and sat through the conference until just after 1.50pm. Then he went to the bathroom with a bag, and returned clad in the fake suicide vest with knives strapped to his wrists, and started his attack. Toby Williamson, who runs Fishmongers\u2019 Hall, told the BBC of the terror when Khan started his attack and the heroic reactions of those present as they fought for their lives: \u201cThis is extraordinary things happening, done by ordinary people.\u201d He said one person tried to shut the door on the \u201cvicious\u201d knifeman while another called the police as two others, named as Andy and \u0141ukasz, took the attacker on: \u201cThey used fire extinguishers, they used chairs. They used these narwhal tusks ripped off the wall, in the heat of the moment. And they took the game back to the knifeman.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Was Usman Khan still serving a prison sentence at the time of the London Bridge attack? What had he done?</strong></h2> <p>Khan was convicted in 2012 in a complex court case involving three connected al-Qaida inspired groups. He was one of three men from Stoke-on-Trent who were convicted of planning to set up a terrorist camp in Pakistan, and had planned to travel there to carry out attacks in Kashmir.</p> <p>Khan, 28, was released from prison on licence last year. At the time of the attack he wearing an electronic tag, managed by the probation service and subject to low-level monitoring.</p> <h2>What sentence did he originally receive?</h2> <p>Khan was originally sentenced in February 2012. Like the other Stoke plotters, he pleaded guilty. The trial judge, Mr Justice Wilkie, weighed up whether to give Khan a fixed, determinate sentence, which under the prevailing rules would have meant he was eligible for release halfway during his prison term, or an indeterminate imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence, which would have meant his release would be subject to a parole board review.</p> <p>He concluded that Khan and two others posed a sufficiently long-term risk to the public to hand down an indeterminate sentence. \u201cIn my judgment,\u201d Wilkie concluded, Khan and the other two Stoke plotters were \u201cmore serious jihadis than the others. They were working to a long-term agenda\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4253cfcbc6942b7ff80053c0f498be7ccd447f69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4253cfcbc6942b7ff80053c0f498be7ccd447f69/0_260_1099_659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Screengrab taken from BBC News of Usman Khan in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Screengrab taken from BBC News of Usman Khan in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC News/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What happened when the case went to the court of appeal?</h2> <p>Khan and the other Stoke plotters successfully appealed against their indeterminate sentences in a case that concluded in March 2013.</p> <p>The court of appeal, chaired by Lord Justice Leveson, concluded that there was no suggestion that Khan or the other two \u201cwould be in a position to activate, operate or participate\u201d any terror training facility in Pakistan, and formed the view that in any event, their terror plans were largely related to overseas.</p> <p>The court decided to impose fixed sentences instead. In Khan\u2019s case this new sentence was a fixed term of 16 years, extended by a further five on licence. That meant he would automatically be allowed out after eight years, without the involvement of the parole board.</p> <h2>Why were such dangerous prisoners let out without parole board oversight?</h2> <p>The type of prison term Khan ultimately received was an extended sentence for public protection (EPP). These were introduced in April 2005, by Labour, in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, alongside the IPP sentences.</p> <p>Initially, both required that a parole board assessment be made before a prisoner could be released. But the prison population soared, partly because parole boards were not impressed by rehabilitation efforts in jail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/30/usman-khan-profile-terrorist-who-wanted-to-bomb-london-stock-exchange\">Usman Khan profile: terrorist who wanted to bomb London Stock Exchange</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour changed the law in 2008 to ease the pressure and for extended sentences only the requirement for parole board oversight was removed. Prisoners like Khan \u2013 who were not subject to any other conditions \u2013 became automatically eligible for release halfway through their jail terms.</p> <p>The rules for terrorism sentencing were changed by the Conservatives in 2015 as Islamic State became more active. All terrorism offenders sentenced since then have to apply for parole. </p> <h2>So is Boris Johnson right to blame Labour?</h2> <p>No. It is true that Labour\u2019s law change of 2008 created the type of extended sentence that allowed Khan to be released automatically. But Labour had also created a viable alternative, in the indeterminate IPP sentence, which required parole board oversight.</p> <p>The Conservatives election manifesto says: \u201cWe will introduce tougher sentencing for the worst offenders and end automatic halfway release from prison for serious crimes\u201d, but it has nothing specific on terror offences. Johnson\u2019s post-attack proposal that terrorists should spend at least 14 years in prison is entirely new.</p> <h2>Is anybody to blame?</h2> <p>It is easy to talk about blame with the benefit of hindsight but difficult to apportion it in reality. Labour had given the judges at the time a choice: an indeterminate sentence requiring parole board oversight or a determinate sentence, which did not.</p> <p>Mr Justice Wilkie chose the first, and the court of appeal overturned his decision and chose the latter. Recent law changes by the Conservatives have only reduced the discretion available to judges in terror cases.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Was Usman Khan still serving a prison sentence at the time of the London Bridge attack? What had he done? Khan was convicted in 2012 in a complex court case involving three connected al-Qaida inspired groups. He was one of three men from Stoke-on-Trent who were convicted of planning to set up a terrorist camp in Pakistan, and had planned to travel there to carry out attacks in Kashmir. Khan, 28, was released from prison on licence last year. At the time of the attack he wearing an electronic tag, managed by the probation service and subject to low-level monitoring. What sentence did he originally receive? Khan was originally sentenced in February 2012. Like the other Stoke plotters, he pleaded guilty. The trial judge, Mr Justice Wilkie, weighed up whether to give Khan a fixed, determinate sentence, which under the prevailing rules would have meant he was eligible for release halfway during his prison term, or an indeterminate imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence, which would have meant his release would be subject to a parole board review. He concluded that Khan and two others posed a sufficiently long-term risk to the public to hand down an indeterminate sentence. \u201cIn my judgment,\u201d Wilkie concluded, Khan and the other two Stoke plotters were \u201cmore serious jihadis than the others. They were working to a long-term agenda\u201d. What happened when the case went to the court of appeal? Khan and the other Stoke plotters successfully appealed against their indeterminate sentences in a case that concluded in March 2013. The court of appeal, chaired by Lord Justice Leveson, concluded that there was no suggestion that Khan or the other two \u201cwould be in a position to activate, operate or participate\u201d any terror training facility in Pakistan, and formed the view that in any event, their terror plans were largely related to overseas. The court decided to impose fixed sentences instead. In Khan\u2019s case this new sentence was a fixed term of 16 years, extended by a further five on licence. That meant he would automatically be allowed out after eight years, without the involvement of the parole board. Why were such dangerous prisoners let out without parole board oversight? The type of prison term Khan ultimately received was an extended sentence for public protection (EPP). These were introduced in April 2005, by Labour, in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, alongside the IPP sentences. Initially, both required that a parole board assessment be made before a prisoner could be released. But the prison population soared, partly because parole boards were not impressed by rehabilitation efforts in jail. Labour changed the law in 2008 to ease the pressure and for extended sentences only the requirement for parole board oversight was removed. Prisoners like Khan \u2013 who were not subject to any other conditions \u2013 became automatically eligible for release halfway through their jail terms. The rules for terrorism sentencing were changed by the Conservatives in 2015 as Islamic State became more active. All terrorism offenders sentenced since then have to apply for parole. So is Boris Johnson right to blame Labour? No. It is true that Labour\u2019s law change of 2008 created the type of extended sentence that allowed Khan to be released automatically. But Labour had also created a viable alternative, in the indeterminate IPP sentence, which required parole board oversight. The Conservatives election manifesto says: \u201cWe will introduce tougher sentencing for the worst offenders and end automatic halfway release from prison for serious crimes\u201d, but it has nothing specific on terror offences. Johnson\u2019s post-attack proposal that terrorists should spend at least 14 years in prison is entirely new. Is anybody to blame? It is easy to talk about blame with the benefit of hindsight but difficult to apportion it in reality. Labour had given the judges at the time a choice: an indeterminate sentence requiring parole board oversight or a determinate sentence, which did not. Mr Justice Wilkie chose the first, and the court of appeal overturned his decision and chose the latter. Recent law changes by the Conservatives have only reduced the discretion available to judges in terror cases.",

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson took his disinformation campaign to the BBC on Sunday with a <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/andrew-marr-boris-johnson-london-bridge-nhs-brexit_uk_5de3b93ee4b0913e6f8059ed\" title=\"\">blizzard</a> of bluster, obfuscation and lies designed to blunt any interrogation. He lowered the bar for political debate by cynically exploiting the terrorist attack on Friday to peddle a plan for draconian sentences, against the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cliodiaspora/status/1200931080615927814\" title=\"\">wishes</a> of a dead victim\u2019s family; then by bizarrely blaming the opposition parties for the release of a terrorist (he was let out because of the sentence imposed by the court of appeal); and last by attempting to smear Jeremy Corbyn with a conspiracy theory about him wanting to <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-falsely-claims-jeremy-21001911\" title=\"\">disband</a> MI5.</p> <p>Mr Johnson, because he is prime minister, has better access to the details of the case of Usman Khan, a terrorist who murdered innocent people in London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2019/nov/30/london-bridge-attack-police-search-property-in-stafford-latest-updates\" title=\"\">last week</a>, than almost anyone else. He knows where he was detained, and what restrictions there were on his movements. He would know what the police and counter-terrorism officers were doing to monitor Khan. But Mr Johnson\u2019s eye is not on the facts to inform the public. Mr Johnson does not care a jot about whether what he says describes reality. This is why he makes facts up. The act is a sinister distraction.</p> <p>Mr Johnson is attempting to distance himself from his party\u2019s grinding destruction of the justice system in England and Wales after nine years of austerity and outsourcing. Only last year the chief inspector of prisons said that present conditions in jails have \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/11/prisoners-prisons-report-england-wales-staff-cuts-peter-clarke\" title=\"\">no place in an advanced nation</a>\u201d. The Khan case threatens to illuminate how the Tory policies have made sure prison does not work, with deadly consequences for the general public. This ought to be a matter of some disquiet as there are people in custody in Britain for terrorism offences who regard prisons as \u201cuniversities of terror\u201d from which to graduate.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson took his disinformation campaign to the BBC on Sunday with a blizzard of bluster, obfuscation and lies designed to blunt any interrogation. He lowered the bar for political debate by cynically exploiting the terrorist attack on Friday to peddle a plan for draconian sentences, against the wishes of a dead victim\u2019s family; then by bizarrely blaming the opposition parties for the release of a terrorist (he was let out because of the sentence imposed by the court of appeal); and last by attempting to smear Jeremy Corbyn with a conspiracy theory about him wanting to disband MI5. Mr Johnson, because he is prime minister, has better access to the details of the case of Usman Khan, a terrorist who murdered innocent people in London last week, than almost anyone else. He knows where he was detained, and what restrictions there were on his movements. He would know what the police and counter-terrorism officers were doing to monitor Khan. But Mr Johnson\u2019s eye is not on the facts to inform the public. Mr Johnson does not care a jot about whether what he says describes reality. This is why he makes facts up. The act is a sinister distraction. Mr Johnson is attempting to distance himself from his party\u2019s grinding destruction of the justice system in England and Wales after nine years of austerity and outsourcing. Only last year the chief inspector of prisons said that present conditions in jails have \u201cno place in an advanced nation\u201d. The Khan case threatens to illuminate how the Tory policies have made sure prison does not work, with deadly consequences for the general public. This ought to be a matter of some disquiet as there are people in custody in Britain for terrorism offences who regard prisons as \u201cuniversities of terror\u201d from which to graduate. It is not as if this problem is new. Prisons have played an instrumental role in many radical political groups including Irish republicans, German Marxists and jihadists. This history might have informed Conservative policy over the last decade so that the management of terror offenders mitigated the risks of prison radicalisation. However, the opposite appears to have happened. During Khan\u2019s time behind bars, the prison and probation services saw budget cuts of about 40%.

In October 2018, with Marco Silva still getting his feet under the table, Everton produced an exhilarating away performance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/06/leicester-city-everton-premier-league-match-report\">winning 2-1</a> and threatening more. \u201cThis is our image,\u201d Silva said afterwards. \u201cIt will be so in the future.\u201d Saturday\u2019s rematch would be an apposite occasion for Silva to prove he can keep his promises, given that anything bar a rapid upturn is likely to spell the end. It is difficult to know what to make of Silva as a manager: there was always the sense that his talents were overhyped somewhat after he made an admittedly respectable fist of keeping Hull in the top flight two and a half years ago and he has shown little to suggest any extraordinary talent since then.

That appears to the scenario that awaits if Brendan Rodgers\u2019 flashing Leicester blades put the Ev to the sword. And Brendan has previous with Everton. Remember that time Thierry Henry squeezed Jamie Carragher\u2019s thigh? That came after King Brenny was dismissed by Liverpool straight after a drab draw at Goodison and the news had reached the Sky studios. <br><br>We could be in for three sackings in a weekend after Arsenal binned Unai Emery and Watford axed poor Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores after just ten matches back in Herts. Slow on the attack, ponderous in defence, just about the last opposition that Silva would want to come up against is Leicester. Only Liverpool and Manchester City have scored more, and Leicester have won their last five matches. Everton have actually won two of their last five but it is the cumulative failure of Silva, a manager they entered legal dispute with Watford over appointing, that is likely to cost him. They are 17th, and that is not nearly good enough. Silva probably needs to repeat what Manuel Pellegrini did on Saturday, and beat one of the best teams in the league to offset the speculation. Well, until they play Liverpool this week, that is. <br><br><strong>Kick-off 4pm UK time. </strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-01T15:28:11.043Z\">at 3.28pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Jonathan Wilson on Everton ... Paul Doyle was at the King Power. Gylfi Sigurdsson speaks, and is honest about what went wrong for Everton. He doesn\u2019t choose to dispute the winner because VAR: It was very disappointing. The shape we set up with suited us well. We felt were solid and it was devastating to lose it at the end. We have come away with as many points as last week. The performance was better than last week. We have to stick together and stay positive. We have a few games coming up to put things right. Jamie Vardy and Kelechi Iheancho have been talking to Sky. JV: We have had decisions go against with VAR and this one went for it. KI: I have been waiting for the opportunity and I knew it would come. It\u2019s about making sure I was working to this standard. It was fantastic for the whole team. You need to be strong mentally. It\u2019s not easy not playing. Jamie is a top lad and a top striker and I am learning from him. JV: Kel came on and we started creating chances. He deserves it. He\u2019s been absolutely amazing in training. Leicester are up to second in the league, leaving Pep Guardiola trailing in their dust. Once they levelled, and a little against the run of play, they were by far the likeliest to win it. Full-time at Old Trafford: Manchester United 2-2 Aston Villa. Jack Grealish\u2019s goal the highlight there, it seems. Kenwright, one of football\u2019s most expressive men, is doing his best to look impassive as he knows the camera is on him. Marco Silva is already in the tunnel; it has been left to Luis Boa Morte to remonstrate with the referee. Oh Marco, oh no. Oh no, oh no, oh no. And footage of Bill Kenwright shows that the axe must surely be looming. Kelechi Iheanacho was superb off the bench. He cannot have played much better than that. But it\u2019s desolation for Everton. 90+7 min: Who says that VAR kills passion? The stadium went crazy after that period of pent-up frustration. Goal? No, VAR. Iheanacho on to a Tielemans pass and scores the winner. The offside flag is up, and then it\u2019s ruled out. Well, for now. The video shows the Nigerian had been played onside. 90+2 min: Sidibe is up and making the most of his injury; Everton eyeing up the draw. 90+1 min: Leicester push for their winner even though Sidibe is down after a collision with Iheanacho. He is grabbing his knee, and appears to be suggesting he is badly hurt. 90 min: Three minutes added on to the 90. 89 min: Silva looks as nervous as hell. As it stands, he probably does get the Merseyside derby to redeem himself. Though good luck with that. 88 min: Michael Keane has taken a whack, which slows down the action for a few seconds. But the pace picks up once again as Leicester chase the win. 87 min: Everton have not entirely given up on winning this: Richarlison has a shot blocked after briefly finding space. Neither, of course, have Leicester. Ricardo\u2019s shot is bundled behind for a corner that Pickford claims and sets up another attack. 85 min: Jamie Vardy sees to have taken a bash to his hooter and has to leave the field for a moment. A flashpoint between Soyuncu follows, as the Turk gets bounced into the advertising boards and lets Kean know his disquiet. Kean is not for backing down, either. 83 min: Tielemans shoots this time, but wide. The chances piling up for Leicester just as the problems are for a pensive Marco Silva. 81 min: Leicester sub: On comes Albrighton for Harvey Barnes, who was looking lively right up until the point he was hauled off. 80 min: And Kean almost made an instant impact. Seeing Schmeicherl off his line he attempts a speculative one, and the ball whips just wide of the post. Schmeichel was nowhere near the ball, and was beaten all ends up. Some of the crowd thought that was in. 79 min: Double Everton sub: Iwobi and Calvert-Lewin off, and Moises Kean and Morgan Schneiderlin on. That seems to be full rejig midfield. 78 min: Tielemans almost forced a chance, but his pass inside was a waste as Iheanacho and Vardy were queueing up. 76 min: Everton are looking ragged now when they had previously seemed organised and confident. That lapse for Vardy\u2019s goal showed off their fragility. 74 min: Leicester now forcing big chances. Iheanacho gives them a let-off when he oversteps the ball and then Vardy\u2019s header from Tielemans\u2019 cross has Pickford panicking. 73 min: Close! Barnes and Vardy combine and then the ball comes inside. Maddison forces a save from Pickford that the goalkeeper cannot have known too much about until the ball was in his grasp. 71 min: Leicester fans now loud and hitting their clackers hard. Everton looking a little downcast, as well they might, but they are at least pushing on for a winner. 70 min: Now, this is a test for Everton, a real test. Vardy appeared like a ghostly apparition, having not been in the contest at all, to score. Brendan Rodgers will take the credit for his change - it was Iheanacho who set up the goal. By the by, it\u2019s Manchester United 2-2 Aston Villa, with Tyrone Mings getting the equaliser. Oh dear, Everton. Lovely work from Ndidi then to Iheanacho, and then at the back post it\u2019s Vardy who scores from close range. 66 min: Two-thirds of the game to go and this looks like something of a tactical coup for Marco Silva. Though if it goes wrong from here, that would look like a felling blow. Latest score: Manchester 2-1 Aston Villa, with Victor Lindelof getting it. 64 min: More Everton attacking. Are Leicester trying to call them on to open up space or are they struggling with an inspired opponent? Kelechi has a shot, but it represents no threat to Pickford. 62 min: Leicester sub: Kelelchi Iheanacho for Ayoze Perez, who has rather disappeared from the contest...meanwhile, Mason Holgate found himself with space to shoot - and possibly a nosebleed - but took too much time and saw his effort blocked. Everton are the better team here and they were nearly ahead when Richarlison pings in a cross that Iwobi cannot get to. 60 min: Ricardo, who has played well for Leicester, robs Richarlison and tries to force a move but again his team run into heavy traffic. 59 min: Everton are doing OK here. Sidibe forces a corner, though wants a handball too...oh, here\u2019s some handbags. Ndidi and Mina clash and the Colombian does a Bob Mortimer \u201cOoh, Vic, I\u2019ve fallen\u201d. Somehow, Ndidi receives the sterner word from the referee. Game\u2019s gone #566668 57 min: On that VAR decision: Matt Burtz: \u201cConsidering Everton was on the admittedly wrong end of a VAR penalty decision against Brighton, the argument could be made that justice has been done here.\u201d Not sure it works like that. Asha: \u201cIf the ref thinks it was a penalty and VAR thinks it wasn\u2019t a penalty. Then presumably VAR can only decide that it\u2019s an obvious error, no?\u201d That\u2019s close to my admittedly none-too expert view of this infernal robot war. 56 min: Leicester stroke the ball around, looking for space within that defensive line that Marco Silva has built for today. 54 min: Surging run from Pereira when Everton lose the ball cheaply in midfield. Fine save from Pickford and Sidibe hacks clear. That might calm the adventurous spirit. 52 min: Everton stepping forward a bit? Looks like they realise they cannot just cling on. Tielemans, though, creates a second of panic when his backpass comes to Pickford, who is forced to slice clear. 50 min: Michael Keane rises highest for the corner but Schmeichel saves with ease before Everton force another. This time, Calvert-Lewin gets up to nod over. 49 min: Leicester look to step matters up, with Maddison out on the left, and Everton break with Iwobi launching a beauty of a pass to Richarlison, who cuts back to Sigurdsson, whose shot is blocked for a corner, which is something of a let-off. 47 min: Some loose play by Soyuncu and Everton almost had a chance to score. Everton are 19th in the league on second-half goals scored while Leicester are second so much can change. 46 min: Back underway. Richarlison, who limped off the field at the end of the first half, looks to be OK to continue. In fact, he looks positively sprightly. Magic Marco\u2019s magic sponge has done the trick. Ben Chilwell led a delegation to complain about that Leicester non-penalty at half-time. Was it a clear and obvious error from ref Graham Scott? Didn\u2019t look it. Does the benefit of the doubt go to the ref? Not this time. And at Old Trafford, it\u2019s still 1-1 between Manchester United and Aston Villa. Villa \u2018bossing it\u2019, according to a source close to the game. Everton\u2019s best 45 minutes of the season and perhaps Leicester\u2019s worst. And a VAR controversy. Did Chilwell dive or did he take evasive action? 45+2 min: Everton looking to hang on a bit here. Could they keep this up in the second half? They have had a heavy workload. The last moment of the half sees them have to hack a Maddison free-kick clear, stop Vardy getting a shot in and then finally clear a corner. 45+1 min: Only two minutes of time added on - which must have come from that VAR incident. The home fans not happy with that. 45 min: Leicester forced to try and and find holes in that massed Everton defence. Richarlison is the outlet for long balls whenever there is chance to get clear. Latest score: Manchester United 1-1 Aston Villa (Rashford, 42) 43 min: Home crowd not as boisterous as usual. Remember, this is a team with a faint but not wholly unrealistic chance of challenging for the title. Everton are actually doing Liverpool a favour here. 41 min: Everton sitting back on their lead but also happy to have Leicester where they can see them. Those counters have been the source of a couple of scares. 39 min: A break in play as Ricardo goes down, having clashed heads with Sidibe. In that move just a minute ago, Tom Davies escaped a booking for a desperate pull on a Leicester escapee. 38 min: Leicester go on the break, with Harvey Barnes involved, as is Maddison until Mina comes across to hack the ball clear. Everton almost paid for leaving themselves open in midfield. 36 min: On the sidelines, the fourth official is still having to explain what all that VAR fuss was about to Brendan Rodgers. 35 min: A reprieve for Silva and for Holgate whose challenge was rash. 34 min: The *home* fans did not like that decision when they saw that on the video screen. Mason Holgate dives in to foul Ben Chilwell after Yerry Mina cleaned out Jamie Vardy. Did Chilwell get touched? That\u2019s the question for VAR. He did seem to accentuate his fall somewhat. The delay takes two minutes...and no penalty. 30 min: Vardy goes for the truly spectacular as Ben Chilwell loops in a cross but fails to find the target. In fact, his overhead kick ends up somewhere in the Market Harborough area. Tony Barr on that Jack Grealish goal for Villa at Old Trafford: \u201cIt was an absolute worldy. Curled into the right corner from the left edge of the box. Hit the side netting first. Magical.\u201d 28 min: James Maddison, who has been peripheral, is fouled by Evertonian dog of war....*checks notes*...Gylfi Sigurdsson. Every manjack is at it from Everton. Maddison meanwhile makes a frightful waste of the resultant free-kick. 26 min: Let\u2019s see what Leicester can conjure. They have been a little flat. 24 min: That *was* a moment of high quality. Everton\u2019s attitude has been good and that was excellent attacking play...meanwhile, another penalty shout, and it\u2019s Perez again, clashing with Sidibe. No dice, though. In fact, it was fine covering from the Frenchman. Great work from Sidibe and a fine header from the Brazilian. Andy Gray would have been proud of that. Marco Silva certainly was. 22 min: It\u2019s crisp, it\u2019s competitive but it\u2019s not yet high on quality. 21 min: Another Leicester penalty shout but it was Sigurdsson\u2019s chops rather than his hand that touched the ball. 20 min: Penalty shout as Perez turns past Keane and falls to the floor. It would have been harsh, and VAR confirms that. 19 min: Tom Davies booked for a heavy tackle. He got carried away there and the pitch look slippery in the icy conditions. 17 min: Perez is looking the liveliest and most likely for Leicester. There is a sudden exchange of attacks as Calvert-Lewin chases down a Keane pass then Schmeichel launches the ball long for Vardy to chase. This is a game played at full pelt. 15 min: Brendan Rodgers is making notes and he may be concerned that Everton have stemmed the flow of his team\u2019s attacks while also showing off their own ability to be dangerous. 14 min: Perez, from his right side position of Leicester\u2019s attacking trident, fizzes in a shot across goal and just wide. Leicester beginning to make chances now. Update from Old Trafford: Manchester United are losing 1-0 to Aston Villa after Jack Grealish\u2019s 11th minute goal. 12 min: Iwobi makes a strong burst down the flank, then the ball comes out wide to Digne. Everton are pushing on here. 10 min: Snap shot for Perez, after Tielemans and Vardy combine but it us straight at Pickford. 9 min: Leicester yet to hit their stride; Everton have disrupted their flow. 7 min: It looks like Everton are sitting deep to try and stop Leicester\u2019s speed on the break. Footage of Leighton Baines on the bench and he doesn\u2019t seem exactly rapt at what is happening ahead of him. He\u2019s possibly dreaming of Miles Kane\u2019s new material...Sidibe, meanwhile, carves forward and gets chance to shoot on goal. The shot is over but Schmeichel was giving off distress signals. 5 min: Leicester in Everton territory but that added man does seem to have caused something of a blockade for the likes of Perez and Vardy. 3 min: A half-chance for Everton. Calvert-Lewin gallops down the flank but his cross evades Richarlison, who seemed to lose the flight of the ball. 2 min: The free-kick was a waste, one of those where the angle is too shallow to test an opposing defence. Ben Chilwell is usually far better than that with the dead ball. 1 min: Everton begin with a spell of possession until Perez is brought down for a free-kick. And away we go...with Fanfare For The Common Man closing out the pre-match prelims as Everton take the kick-off. The King Power sounds loud; these are happy days in Leicester, almost as happy as four seasons ago when they were going for the title. Marco Silva looks pensive, morose almost. Here\u2019s Marco Silva, who is defiant though rather garbled as he tries to explain his plan for the game. We have had a lot of problems in the last few weeks for our midfielders. Morgan [Schneiderlin] has had a problem this week and we decided to play three at the back. The formation is not the most important thing. What will make the difference in the attitude on the pitch. We have to change our performance from last week. We have to change the feeling we had last week. We have have to be strong, compact and we don\u2019t leave space. Here\u2019s Brendan Rodgers, the calm, collected elder statesman of the Premier League, a man of perspective and poise. This is the fifth week in a row he has been able to select an unchanged team. It\u2019s good if you can keep that stability and rhythm the team but we have players waiting in the wings. We are only playing one game a week at the moment. It looks like they are going to play 5-4-1, which has happened a few times here lately. They are usually 4-2-3-1 so it\u2019s a solution we have to find but these players have been brilliant. There\u2019s always a lot of noise around players and teams and managers. We have to be at our best to get a result. It has to be said that Leicester\u2019s players look chirpier than today\u2019s opponents. Tom Davies, the Everton midfielder who looks like a member of Scouse psych legends The Stairs, looks quite relaxed as he speaks to Sky. It would a great to get a good start. It\u2019s a chance to put things right from last week. They are on good form so we will have to be at out best. Wolves and Sheffield United also drew 1-1, with Matt Doherty\u2019s second-half goal levelling Lyss Mousset\u2019s early opener. Reports to follow on both those games. It\u2019s all over between Norwich and Arsenal and it was quite some game. Here\u2019s what Nick had to say about this match in this week\u2019s Premier League talking points. Time running out for Silva to recapture early swagger Everton are not the only club that might feel shamed by the quality of work done by Brendan Rodgers within nine months of his arrival at Leicester, but a comparison with the last time these two sides met at the King Power Stadium highlights their wildly divergent directions of travel. In October 2018, with Marco Silva still getting his feet under the table, Everton produced an exhilarating away performance, winning 2-1 and threatening more. \u201cThis is our image,\u201d Silva said afterwards. \u201cIt will be so in the future.\u201d Saturday\u2019s rematch would be an apposite occasion for Silva to prove he can keep his promises, given that anything bar a rapid upturn is likely to spell the end. It is difficult to know what to make of Silva as a manager: there was always the sense that his talents were overhyped somewhat after he made an admittedly respectable fist of keeping Hull in the top flight two and a half years ago and he has shown little to suggest any extraordinary talent since then. Time is running out for him to change that opinion. A vote of confidence from the goalie is a variation on a theme. Leicester are unchanged from the team that beat Brighton 2-0 last time out, and why not, considering their rich form. For his final (?) fling of the dice, Marco Silva has made three changes with Michael Keane, Alex Iwobi and Dominic Calvert-Lewin coming in. Morgan Schneiderlin, Theo Walcott and Cenk Tosun are the men to make way, and it looks like Silva has opted for three at the back to try and deal with those Leicester fliers. Leicester: Schmeichel, Chilwell, Ricardo, Soyuncu, Evans, Ndidi, Tielemans, Maddison, Barnes, Perez, Vardy. Subs: Ward, Justin, Morgan, Albrighton, Iheanacho, Choudhury, Praet. Everton: Pickford, Digne, Sidibe, Holgate, Keane, Mina, Davies, Sigurdsson, Iwobi, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Lossl, Baines, Tosun, Schneiderlin, Bernard, Kean, Gordon. Farewell, then, Marco Silva? That appears to the scenario that awaits if Brendan Rodgers\u2019 flashing Leicester blades put the Ev to the sword. And Brendan has previous with Everton. Remember that time Thierry Henry squeezed Jamie Carragher\u2019s thigh? That came after King Brenny was dismissed by Liverpool straight after a drab draw at Goodison and the news had reached the Sky studios. We could be in for three sackings in a weekend after Arsenal binned Unai Emery and Watford axed poor Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores after just ten matches back in Herts. Slow on the attack, ponderous in defence, just about the last opposition that Silva would want to come up against is Leicester. Only Liverpool and Manchester City have scored more, and Leicester have won their last five matches. Everton have actually won two of their last five but it is the cumulative failure of Silva, a manager they entered legal dispute with Watford over appointing, that is likely to cost him. They are 17th, and that is not nearly good enough. Silva probably needs to repeat what Manuel Pellegrini did on Saturday, and beat one of the best teams in the league to offset the speculation. Well, until they play Liverpool this week, that is. Kick-off 4pm UK time.",

I know what is my job. Tomorrow will be another day for me to prepare another training session.\u201d</p> \n<p>Given the respective form of the teams going into this game, it seemed as if an Everton win would require something close to miraculous. One might have thought that Silva\u2019s strategy, with a new three-man central defence, smacked of a Hail Mary. But in fairness to the beleaguered manager, it turned out to have been immaculately conceived. Leicester struggled for long periods to find openings in the visitors\u2019 defence. Everton\u2019s players certainly did not lie down to sacrifice their manager, applying the gameplan with dynamism and discipline. \u201cI never had doubts about that,\u201d Silva said.</p> \n<p>His team also carried a threat on the counterattack and he could take satisfaction in the eighth minute from seeing his wing-backs combine to dangerous effect, with Lucas Digne crossing from the left for Djibril Sidib\u00e9, whose shot from the edge of the box whizzed just over the bar.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/01/leicester-city-everton-premier-league\">Silva\u2019s side lift the clouds but VAR denies them a silver lining | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Leicester have not been accustomed to being blunted and outgunned this season. They started to pass and move faster in an effort to unhinge Everton. Ayoze P\u00e9rez registered their first shot on target in the 10th minute but it was a weak effort. P\u00e9rez did better moments later, skedaddling between Michael Keane and Yerry Mina before firing just past the far post.</p> \n<p>Mostly, though, Everton absorbed the hosts\u2019 pressure well. Then they took the lead with a fine attack.</p> \n<p>It began with a throw-in in their own half. Richarlison received it on the left, flipping the ball off to a teammate and scampering forward. When Alex Iwobi slid it out to Sidib\u00e9 on the other flank, the Frenchman delivered a splendid cross and Richarlison darted in front of Ricardo Pereira and directed a terrific header beyond Kasper Schmeichel from 10 yards.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e1f03660-5966-45ec-bb51-532da5869a53\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TP5LQPyzkk8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe went behind and that\u2019s when you see the mentality and quality of your team,\u201d said Rodgers. Mina had to make two excellent blocks to prevent an equaliser, denying P\u00e9rez and Jonny Evans.</p> \n<p>But Leicester kept coming and in the 33rd minute they thought they had the perfect opportunity to draw level when the referee pointed to the spot after Ben Chilwell went down following a wild swing by Mason Holgate. The defender missed the ball and forced Chilwell to take evasive action \u2013 but apparently that did not justify a penalty according to the VAR official, who advised the referee to overturn the original decision.</p> \n<p>Everton were first to threaten in the second half, Keane going close from a corner by Gylfi Sigurdsson. That drew a sharp retort from Leicester, Wilfred Ndidi winning the ball in midfield before offloading to Pereira, who charged forward before drilling a low shot goalwards. Jordan Pickford tipped it wide.</p> \n<p>Rodgers replaced P\u00e9rez with Iheanacho on the hour, instructing the newcomer to play closer to Vardy. Within six minutes the change paid off, as Iheanacho collected a pass from Ndidi and crossed low for Vardy to tap in from close range.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"212d6b1736710516c1b373472970d2f682bd39af\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/212d6b1736710516c1b373472970d2f682bd39af/37_0_2946_1768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richarlison heads beyond Kasper Schmeichel to give Everton the half-time lead.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richarlison heads beyond Kasper Schmeichel to give Everton the half-time lead.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>With Leicester pressing for the win, the Everton substitute Moise Kean came close to scoring on the counterattack, his chip from 20 yards narrowly missing the target.

I know what is my job. Tomorrow will be another day for me to prepare another training session.\u201d Given the respective form of the teams going into this game, it seemed as if an Everton win would require something close to miraculous. One might have thought that Silva\u2019s strategy, with a new three-man central defence, smacked of a Hail Mary. But in fairness to the beleaguered manager, it turned out to have been immaculately conceived. Leicester struggled for long periods to find openings in the visitors\u2019 defence. Everton\u2019s players certainly did not lie down to sacrifice their manager, applying the gameplan with dynamism and discipline. \u201cI never had doubts about that,\u201d Silva said. His team also carried a threat on the counterattack and he could take satisfaction in the eighth minute from seeing his wing-backs combine to dangerous effect, with Lucas Digne crossing from the left for Djibril Sidib\u00e9, whose shot from the edge of the box whizzed just over the bar. Leicester have not been accustomed to being blunted and outgunned this season. They started to pass and move faster in an effort to unhinge Everton. Ayoze P\u00e9rez registered their first shot on target in the 10th minute but it was a weak effort. P\u00e9rez did better moments later, skedaddling between Michael Keane and Yerry Mina before firing just past the far post. Mostly, though, Everton absorbed the hosts\u2019 pressure well. Then they took the lead with a fine attack. It began with a throw-in in their own half. Richarlison received it on the left, flipping the ball off to a teammate and scampering forward. When Alex Iwobi slid it out to Sidib\u00e9 on the other flank, the Frenchman delivered a splendid cross and Richarlison darted in front of Ricardo Pereira and directed a terrific header beyond Kasper Schmeichel from 10 yards. \u201cWe went behind and that\u2019s when you see the mentality and quality of your team,\u201d said Rodgers. Mina had to make two excellent blocks to prevent an equaliser, denying P\u00e9rez and Jonny Evans. But Leicester kept coming and in the 33rd minute they thought they had the perfect opportunity to draw level when the referee pointed to the spot after Ben Chilwell went down following a wild swing by Mason Holgate. The defender missed the ball and forced Chilwell to take evasive action \u2013 but apparently that did not justify a penalty according to the VAR official, who advised the referee to overturn the original decision. Everton were first to threaten in the second half, Keane going close from a corner by Gylfi Sigurdsson. That drew a sharp retort from Leicester, Wilfred Ndidi winning the ball in midfield before offloading to Pereira, who charged forward before drilling a low shot goalwards. Jordan Pickford tipped it wide. Rodgers replaced P\u00e9rez with Iheanacho on the hour, instructing the newcomer to play closer to Vardy. Within six minutes the change paid off, as Iheanacho collected a pass from Ndidi and crossed low for Vardy to tap in from close range. With Leicester pressing for the win, the Everton substitute Moise Kean came close to scoring on the counterattack, his chip from 20 yards narrowly missing the target. Most of the action was at the other end, however, with Leicester attacking in waves. Their relentlessness was rewarded in stoppage time, when Pereira stormed forward and fed Iheanacho, who finished smartly. The goal was originally disallowed for offside but this time VAR intervened in Leicester\u2019s favour, ruling that Iheanacho was onside thanks to the position of Mina\u2019s knee. Sometimes a match, a title race and a manager\u2019s future can come down to fine margins.",

In June, the Institute of Health Visiting published a position paper, voicing concern \u201cabout the quality and effectiveness of the service that families are now receiving\u201d. More than a quarter of health visitors (27%) were each responsible for 500 or more children, it said.</p> <p>Labour says its analysis of <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/nhs-workforce-statistics/july-2019\">NHS England data</a> shows that the number of women who did not get a visit at 28 weeks or more of pregnancy increased by more than 6,000 between 2017-18 and 2018-19.

More than 23% of children did not get their one-year review within the first 12 months of life, rising to 39% in London.</p> <p>Labour has promised to introduce a further mandated health visit at about three to four months after birth. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary , said it would recruit more than 4,000 extra health visitors and school nurses if it got into power as well as put \u00a340bn into the NHS. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust the Tories with our NHS.

Babies and women deserve better at such a crucial point in their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Luciana Berger, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 health, wellbeing and social care spokeswoman, said the figures were particularly concerning as the country entered winter, putting more people at risk.</p> <p>\u201cIt is well known that the number of health visitors has fallen under the Conservative government over the last four years.

In June, the Institute of Health Visiting published a position paper, voicing concern \u201cabout the quality and effectiveness of the service that families are now receiving\u201d. More than a quarter of health visitors (27%) were each responsible for 500 or more children, it said. Labour says its analysis of NHS England data shows that the number of women who did not get a visit at 28 weeks or more of pregnancy increased by more than 6,000 between 2017-18 and 2018-19. New birth visits were delayed \u2013 11% nationally did not take place within the first 14 days. Across England, 15% of babies missed out on their six- to eight-week review last year, rising to 29% in London. More than 23% of children did not get their one-year review within the first 12 months of life, rising to 39% in London. Labour has promised to introduce a further mandated health visit at about three to four months after birth. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary , said it would recruit more than 4,000 extra health visitors and school nurses if it got into power as well as put \u00a340bn into the NHS. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust the Tories with our NHS. The Conservatives used to boast of their commitment to increase the number of health visitors, yet we have actually seen health visitors in the NHS cut by a third in over three years, with patchy provision of visits. Babies and women deserve better at such a crucial point in their lives.\u201d Luciana Berger, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 health, wellbeing and social care spokeswoman, said the figures were particularly concerning as the country entered winter, putting more people at risk. \u201cIt is well known that the number of health visitors has fallen under the Conservative government over the last four years. The Conservatives\u2019 policy on Brexit is driving away EU staff from working in the NHS, and has also seen a fall in the number of nurses from the EU joining the NHS,\u201d she said. \u201cThe new nurse tax [visa and health surcharge costs] that the Conservatives are proposing at this election will only make the problem worse. \u201cLiberal Democrats would stop Brexit to support our NHS workforce, introduce an NHS recruitment strategy and invest \u00a37bn a year extra in health and social care.\u201d The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cThere are more nurses working in the health service than in 2010, and the Conservatives are investing in our NHS to ensure we have the workforce we need for the future. \u201cA Conservative majority government will deliver 50,000 more nurses and create 6,000 more GPs \u2013 to make sure everyone can get the care and treatment they need faster. \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s plans for a four-day week and for uncontrolled and unlimited immigration would cripple our NHS. Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives can get Brexit done and focus on delivering for the NHS.\u201d",

It said the pair planned to persuade wealthy contacts to invest in a fund structured in the Cayman Islands, promising them tax-free income. It was unknown if the venture ever operated, the paper said, but was in existence until March this year. One of Andrew\u2019s subsidiary royal titles is Earl of Inverness.</p> \n<p>The newspaper also alleged that in an email exchange with the prince, when he was faced with losing his envoy role because of the Epstein scandal, Jonathan Rowland suggested their commercial activities could continue \u201cunder the radar\u201d. The paper claimed prince responded: \u201cI like your thinking.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prince stepped aside as trade envoy in 2011 after it became public that he had stayed with Epstein following the convicted sex offender\u2019s release from prison.</p> \n<p>A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: \u201cThe Duke of York was the UK\u2019s special representative for international trade and investment between 2001 and July 2011 and in that time the aim, and that of his office, was to promote Britain and British interests overseas not the interests of individuals.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Mail on Sunday said David Rowland, who quit as Tory party treasurer shortly after he was appointed in 2010 amid controversy over his business affairs, and his son had declined to comment for legal reasons.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The royal family is braced for more revelations about the Duke of York\u2019s connections with Jeffrey Epstein, as the BBC prepares to air a Panorama interview with his accuser Virginia Giuffre on Monday night. Giuffre was interviewed by the programme last month for a long-running investigation about Prince Andrew and his connections with the deceased sex offender. But before the Panorama episode was ready to air, Andrew agreed to do a disastrous sit-down interview with the rival BBC programme Newsnight. The BBC has confirmed that the Panorama episode, called The Prince and the Epstein Scandal, will be shown in a specially lengthened hour-long edition, including Giuffre\u2019s first British television interview regarding her meetings with the prince. She claims she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with the prince, who posed alongside her at the home of Ghislaine Maxwell in an infamous photograph. \u201cIt was a really scary time in my life,\u201d Giuffre says in a brief clip issued by the BBC ahead of the programme. \u201cHe knows what happened, I know what happened. And there\u2019s only one of us telling the truth.\u201d Because the interview was filmed last month she will not directly respond to the prince\u2019s Newsnight interview, in which the royal claimed that sex with the then teenager \u201cnever happened\u201d, insisting he had been at a Pizza Express in Woking on the day it allegedly took place. He said it was a \u201cpositive act\u201d for a man to have sex and said that made it very hard to forget: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to try and forget positive action and I do not remember anything.\u201d He added: \u201cI can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\u201d The BBC said the programme revealed new details about Giuffre\u2019s time with Epstein, while also looking at Maxwell, who has not been seen in public for months. The high society magazine Tatler failed to track her down, while the Sun has offered a \u00a310,000 reward to anyone who can locate her. The prince has faced fresh accusations relating to his financial affairs and calls for him to be stripped of his HRH title. An investigation by the Mail on Sunday claimed the duke had conflicts of interest in relation to the multimillionaire property developer David Rowland, 74, described by the newspaper as his \u201cclose friend\u201d, and his role as the UK\u2019s special representative for international trade and investment. It claimed leaked emails revealed the prince was \u201cquietly plugging\u201d a private Luxembourg-based bank, owned by the Rowland family. The newspaper alleged the prince allowed Rowland\u2019s son, Jonathan, to accompany him on taxpayer-funded official trade missions to China and Saudi Arabia, which would have enabled the family to expand their bank and woo powerful and wealthy clients. It also claimed Andrew held a 40% stake in an offshore company with David Rowland, called Inverness Asset Management (IAM) based in the British Virgin Islands. It said the pair planned to persuade wealthy contacts to invest in a fund structured in the Cayman Islands, promising them tax-free income. It was unknown if the venture ever operated, the paper said, but was in existence until March this year. One of Andrew\u2019s subsidiary royal titles is Earl of Inverness. The newspaper also alleged that in an email exchange with the prince, when he was faced with losing his envoy role because of the Epstein scandal, Jonathan Rowland suggested their commercial activities could continue \u201cunder the radar\u201d. The paper claimed prince responded: \u201cI like your thinking.\u201d The prince stepped aside as trade envoy in 2011 after it became public that he had stayed with Epstein following the convicted sex offender\u2019s release from prison. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: \u201cThe Duke of York was the UK\u2019s special representative for international trade and investment between 2001 and July 2011 and in that time the aim, and that of his office, was to promote Britain and British interests overseas not the interests of individuals.\u201d The Mail on Sunday said David Rowland, who quit as Tory party treasurer shortly after he was appointed in 2010 amid controversy over his business affairs, and his son had declined to comment for legal reasons.",

      "bodyText": "The contrast could not have been sharper. David Merritt, the father of the first named victim of the London Bridge terrorist, responded: \u201cMy son, Jack, who was killed in this attack, would not wish his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or detaining people unnecessarily.\u201d But he had barely uttered the words before Boris Johnson was vowing to introduce a \u201ctougher\u201d sentencing regime that would, in the words of the headline writers, \u201clock terrorists up and throw away the key\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s unseemly rush to avert a repeat of the politically damaging debate about police numbers in the aftermath of the previous London Bridge attack, in the middle of the 2017 general election campaign, has led him to ask the wrong question. In his tortuous attempt to find a way to blame Labour for the attack, Johnson wants us to relentlessly focus on the question of how Usman Khan could have been let out so early. The real question to be asked is, how could a convicted terrorist spend eight years inside the English prison system and still emerge a radical jihadist? The answer has to be viewed against a background of prison and probation services that have faced part-privatisation and cuts, under austerity, of 40% in funding during the time that Khan was in prison. Prisons have had to cope with record levels of violence, assaults and suicides. As the former chief inspector of prisons, Nick Hardwick, put it on Sunday: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear. All this talk about longer sentences, deradicalisation programmes and closer probation supervision \u2013 who, precisely, is going to do this? These are services in crisis, haemorrhaging experienced staff and struggling with chaotic reforms.\u201d Official concern about slow progress in turning prisoners away from terrorism and concern about their release into the community emerged as long ago as 2011. A Home Office review of the Prevent counter-terrorism strategy revealed that there was \u201cno proven methodology\u201d and the bespoke programmes that had been developed had \u201conly reached a small proportion of the target population and have not kept pace\u201d with the increasing number of releases of terrorist prisoners. Two main intervention programmes have been developed since 2007 to tackle the problem. Healthy Identity Intervention delivers one-to-one individually tailored sessions, and al-Furqan (meaning distinguishing truth and falsehood) is specifically for Islamist offenders whose ideology has become bedded in extremist interpretations of Islam. Both were regarded by the peer-reviewed Prison Service Journal as still in their \u201crelative infancy\u201d in 2012. Those convicted of terrorism-related offences who are released into the community are managed under multi-agency public protection arrangements used for convicted sex offenders with a battery of extra restrictions, including denial of access to the internet. It is a challenging system for a part-privatised probation service in crisis. Khan is said to have complied with all his restrictions in the 11 months since his release. Michael Gove did try to address this lack of progress in prison deradicalisation programmes when he became justice secretary in 2015. His somewhat obsessive interest in Islamist radicalism had led him to write a book, Celsius 7/7, and commission a report from a former prison governor and Whitehall official, Ian Acheson. Acheson wrote in the Sunday Times that there were 220 people like Khan currently in the system but there had been\u201clittle tangible progress\u201d since his report. He accused the prison and probation service of \u201cinstitutional timidity\u201d and lacking the \u201cleadership, competence or will\u201d to deal with the terrorist threat. As a recent Ministry of Justice (MoJ) analysis report revealed, enormous effort went into implementing Gove/Acheson\u2019s principal recommendation, which was to set up a network of high-security separation centres \u2013 quickly dubbed \u201cjihadi jails\u201d \u2013 to remove the hardest cases from the mainstream prison population and to tackle their radicalisation. The 2019 MoJ research also revealed that only two of the three funded separation units had opened in high-security jails because of a lack of referrals, and that each had held only three to six men at any one time. The third unit has still not opened. More worryingly, the MoJ study also concluded that a key challenge was that many of the men had \u201crefused to engage in aspects of the centres, especially interventions to support disengagement from extremism and address their offending behaviour\u201d.

Cher and Bette Midler shared De Havillands for years, until Cher, on discovering he was still alive in 1995, but at yet another career nadir, ordered 13 pairs to make sure she never ran out.</p> <p>He always explained that his attraction to elegant feet and sexy gait had started when he was a small boy, viewing his father\u2019s female customers from peep toe through ankle strap to stocking seams; father confected black-market wartime shoes from scavenged scraps for clients including West End showgirls and dancers from the rude nude <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2012/jul/20/windmill-lap-dancing-club-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Windmill theatre in Soho</a>.</p> <p>The Higginses later expanded to a small factory, Waverley Shoes, to produce some orthopaedic, some flash, shoes, including the winkle-pickers with \u201chuge dangerous points\u201d favoured by the Kray family entourage. Young Terry picked the De Havilland name out of a phone book because he wanted to be a film star; after a brief attempt at that, he went back in 1957 to the family business, where his first original experiment was chopping the points off winkle-picker lasts.</p> <p>Queen magazine\u2019s fashion editor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/sep/19/pressandpublishing.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Anne Trehearne</a>, spotted a pair of De Havillands worn on a King\u2019s Road shoot by his model and girlfriend in 1964, featured his work and brought in his first big-money clients.

He instinctually created artworks on the last, delivered the goods on time and came up with ideas others monetised years later (cone heels, clear plastic stilettos). However he did not recognise seasons, let alone fashion evolution. Punks got all the power they could afford from over-the-counter Doc Martens, and Cobblers went into liquidation in 1979.</p> <p>Since someone would always pay for a mad alternative to the vogue, De Havilland did not give up his antique sewing machine. There came, without his name on the label, Kamikaze Shoes for stilettos and goth boots, which went bust in 1989, and both The Magic Shoe Company and a Camden Market shop, which stocked glamrock for burlesque and transvestites, fetishwear for actual fetishists and Transmuter spiked boots for the goth-rock singer <a href=\"http://www.marilynmanson.com/\" title=\"\">Marilyn Manson</a>.</p> <p>De Havilland disappeared so much from public view that Cher, who tracked him down in 1995, had assumed that he was dead, as likely did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/miu-miu\" title=\"\">Prada\u2019s Miu Miu label</a>, which produced near-copies of his 70s top hit in 2003.

He satisfied them and the 200,000 unstarry women who bought his three-tier wedges in the 70s. Cher and Bette Midler shared De Havillands for years, until Cher, on discovering he was still alive in 1995, but at yet another career nadir, ordered 13 pairs to make sure she never ran out. He always explained that his attraction to elegant feet and sexy gait had started when he was a small boy, viewing his father\u2019s female customers from peep toe through ankle strap to stocking seams; father confected black-market wartime shoes from scavenged scraps for clients including West End showgirls and dancers from the rude nude Windmill theatre in Soho. The Higginses later expanded to a small factory, Waverley Shoes, to produce some orthopaedic, some flash, shoes, including the winkle-pickers with \u201chuge dangerous points\u201d favoured by the Kray family entourage. Young Terry picked the De Havilland name out of a phone book because he wanted to be a film star; after a brief attempt at that, he went back in 1957 to the family business, where his first original experiment was chopping the points off winkle-picker lasts. Queen magazine\u2019s fashion editor, Anne Trehearne, spotted a pair of De Havillands worn on a King\u2019s Road shoot by his model and girlfriend in 1964, featured his work and brought in his first big-money clients. The rock world then was beginning to explore the theatrical appeal of 40s exaggeration in clothing and shoes. That\u2019s when he looked in the loft for the platform lasts and wedges: \u201cThey put you up on a stage,\u201d he said. De Havilland remembered the party lifestyle of his Cobblers years vividly \u2013 from caviar, champagne, cocaine on opening day to pouring milk into shoe samples to feed stray cats \u2013 but he never learned how to do retail. He instinctually created artworks on the last, delivered the goods on time and came up with ideas others monetised years later (cone heels, clear plastic stilettos). However he did not recognise seasons, let alone fashion evolution. Punks got all the power they could afford from over-the-counter Doc Martens, and Cobblers went into liquidation in 1979. Since someone would always pay for a mad alternative to the vogue, De Havilland did not give up his antique sewing machine. There came, without his name on the label, Kamikaze Shoes for stilettos and goth boots, which went bust in 1989, and both The Magic Shoe Company and a Camden Market shop, which stocked glamrock for burlesque and transvestites, fetishwear for actual fetishists and Transmuter spiked boots for the goth-rock singer Marilyn Manson. De Havilland disappeared so much from public view that Cher, who tracked him down in 1995, had assumed that he was dead, as likely did Prada\u2019s Miu Miu label, which produced near-copies of his 70s top hit in 2003. Prada claimed these were a \u201chomage\u201d, eventually paying a settlement, and the publicity about the affair, with high prices for his real vintage pairs, energised him after a heart attack. From 2003 to his death, he produced and sold new ranges, both directly and through licensing, inventively reworking his artworks \u201cbetween the fierce and the gorgeous\u201d. He also crafted couture pairs in his Dalston studio: Kate Moss went on her honeymoon with \u201cfuck me\u201d and \u201cfuck you\u201d spelled out in crystal on her platform soles. Students at the London College of Fashion, where he was visiting professor, adored his racy stories; he became a member of the Cordwainers advisory panel, and was given a Drapers\u2019 lifetime achievement award in 2010. With geezer candour, he said it was always about sex, and that being a shoemaker charmed women, including Sandy Conlin, the mother of his son Perry; ex-Windmill girl Perin Lewis, mother of Jason; Angie Burdon, mother of Caesar; and his wife, Liz, whom he met in 1990 when she was modelling fetishwear. She had the hard business head he had lacked. They delayed their 2003 wedding to complete rush orders. Liz, his three sons, and his grandchildren, Joseph, Leila, Jamie, India and Kai, survive him. \u2022 Terry de Havilland (Terrence Higgins), shoemaker and designer, born 21 March 1938; died 27 November 2019",

      "body": "<p>Michael Howard, who has died aged 97, was the most influential British military historian of his generation. He left a mark on public and professional debate in Britain and internationally. He also had a key part in building institutions: what is now <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/\" title=\"\">the International Institute for Strategic Studies</a>, based in London, which became the model for similar thinktanks around the world; what is now <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/research/groups/mhc/index\" title=\"\">the Sir Michael Howard Centre for the Study of War</a> at King\u2019s College London; and <a href=\"https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/centre/centre-for-international-studies.html\" title=\"\">the graduate studies programme in international relations at Oxford University</a>.</p> <p>He enjoyed a unique combination of beliefs, skills and, as he freely admitted, luck. The unifying theme of all his work was <a href=\"https://archives.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/interviews/Howard_Michael.html\" title=\"\">the placing of military history and strategic thought in the broadest social and political context</a>.</p> <p>In his view, armed force is an ineluctable element in international relations. He also knew how catastrophic official decision-making on war often is. The approach to international security that he advanced avoided the pitfalls of hawkishness and pacifism. His writing and lecturing was trenchant and accessible. He combined intellectual distinction with common sense. His views were respected even by those who took a different stance.</p> <p>He was the epitome of respectability, even grandeur: a Guards officer, member of the Athenaeum, regius professor, author of official histories of the second world war, and recipient of honours including the Military Cross, a knighthood (1986), CH (2002) and OM (2005). Yet he also had a non-conformist streak, reflected in his support throughout the cold war years for tempering nuclear deterrence with moderation and for practical measures of arms control. Nonconformism also infused other aspects of his life.</p> <p>The 21 years he spent at King\u2019s began in 1947 with a lectureship in the history department, covering Europe from 1500 to 1914. It was on the strength of his first big book, The Coldstream Guards 1920\u20131946 (1951, co-authored with John Sparrow) \u2013 which he later played down as \u201cmy regimental war history\u201d \u2013 that he was appointed in 1953 to a newly created lectureship in military studies at King\u2019s. This appointment, enabling him to escape the history department, where he had not been happy, was made at a time when the world was still trying to digest the implications of the first tests of thermonuclear weapons by the US and USSR.</p> <p>In the next 10 years, he embarked on a \u201cvoyage of discovery\u201d. He had to acquire at least an acquaintance with various technologies, civil-military relations, defence decision-making and revolutionary war. His writing was sometimes stronger on generalisation than on detail. \u201cI had to skim the surface of many disciplines without having the chance thoroughly to master any one.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgDpm-ZWQPo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VgDpm-ZWQPo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Michael Howard addressing the International Institute for Strategic Studies in 2014</figcaption> </figure>   <p>His first book contribution to policy debates, Disengagement in Europe, came in 1958, the year that the then <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/about-us\" title=\"\">Institute of Strategic Studies</a> was founded. Its subject, possible force reductions in central Europe, was controversial: Michael\u2019s voice was recognised as calm and wise.</p> <p>At the same time he was deeply alarmed about the possibility of nuclear war. Over 40 years later he revealed to me that in 1958 he had obtained by unofficial channels two suicide pills, as a precautionary measure because of his concern about what to do in the event of a nuclear war. He said he had recently got rid of the pills, but kept the envelope in which they had come. He indicated that his worries had probably resulted from a combination of factors \u2014 the disputes over Berlin, and the \u201cuse them or lose them\u201d nature of surface-based and liquid-fuelled missiles of that time; and that in the 1980s, at the time of controversies about nuclear missiles at Greenham Common and elsewhere, he was again very worried.</p> <p>Military history remained at the centre of his work. His masterpiece, The Franco-Prussian War (1961), reflected his interest in the changing nature of war and the role of force in the process of German unification in the 1860s and 70s. He viewed France\u2019s decision to go to war as catastrophic.</p> <p>In writing this book, Michael had from 1958 engaged as a research assistant Mark James, whose help was acknowledged in the preface. From 1961 onwards, apart from two years when Mark was teaching in Ghana, they lived together. In 1964 they bought a house in the village of Eastbury, Berkshire \u2013 initially as a weekend and holiday retreat from London-based jobs, and later as a main home. There they pursued shared interests in music and gardening. At first the relationship had to be discreet and a distinction drawn between public and private.</p> <p>In 1963 Michael was appointed professor of war studies at King\u2019s, where his pre-eminent achievement was building up the department of war studies and recruiting to it an impressive and intellectually diverse group of scholars. It attracted graduate students from near and far.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"44dca6b2576b98505f4c5d77b4c2433824d549f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44dca6b2576b98505f4c5d77b4c2433824d549f9/0_0_654_1039/629.jpg\" alt=\"The Franco-Prussian War, 1961, reflected Michael Howard\u2019s interest in the changing nature of international conflict\" width=\"629\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Franco-Prussian War, 1961, reflected Michael Howard\u2019s interest in the changing nature of international conflict</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He consolidated his reputation as a writer and broadcaster on military issues. In 1968, three days after the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia, he gave a talk on BBC Radio\u2019s Third Programme showing cool judgment about an event that unnerved many. While recognising all the reasons why this was seen as a disaster that stirred deep emotions, he argued cogently that it actually reinforced the case for building up contacts with communist countries.</p> <p>Later that year he moved to Oxford, as a fellow in higher defence studies, one of several posts established on the initiative of the Ministry of Defence. In 1977 he was elected Chichele professor of the history of war. Both positions were at All Souls College, from which he contributed to the growth of graduate studies in military subjects and international relations throughout the university.</p> <p>Then in 1980 he became regius professor of modern history, an appointment in which the prime minister had the final say. Some commented that he got the job because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a> liked his views, but such muttering diminished greatly over time. As regius professor (and now at Oriel College) he had to devote himself mainly to the faculty of modern history, helping to steer through some overdue reforms to Oxford\u2019s excessively anglocentric syllabus.</p> <p>His record of publication in his 21 years at Oxford was formidable. Nine major books in that period included the volume in the UK Official History of the Second World War on Grand Strategy (1972), the authoritative translation of <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/on-war/carl-von-clausewitz/michael-howard/9780199540020\" title=\"\">Carl von Clausewitz\u2019s On War</a> (with Peter Paret, 1976), a gem-like survey of <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/war-in-european-history-9780199546190?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;\" title=\"\">War in European History</a> (1976), and the deeply reflective <a href=\"https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/war-and-the-liberal-conscience/\" title=\"\">War and the Liberal Conscience</a> (1978). He also published an edited collection, Restraints on War (1979), that successfully explored the impact of the laws of war in recent history.</p> <p>One major work done at Oxford was published only later. He wrote Strategic Deception (1990), a volume of the official history of British Intelligence in the second world war.

      "bodyText": "Michael Howard, who has died aged 97, was the most influential British military historian of his generation. He left a mark on public and professional debate in Britain and internationally. He also had a key part in building institutions: what is now the International Institute for Strategic Studies, based in London, which became the model for similar thinktanks around the world; what is now the Sir Michael Howard Centre for the Study of War at King\u2019s College London; and the graduate studies programme in international relations at Oxford University. He enjoyed a unique combination of beliefs, skills and, as he freely admitted, luck. The unifying theme of all his work was the placing of military history and strategic thought in the broadest social and political context. In his view, armed force is an ineluctable element in international relations. He also knew how catastrophic official decision-making on war often is. The approach to international security that he advanced avoided the pitfalls of hawkishness and pacifism. His writing and lecturing was trenchant and accessible. He combined intellectual distinction with common sense. His views were respected even by those who took a different stance. He was the epitome of respectability, even grandeur: a Guards officer, member of the Athenaeum, regius professor, author of official histories of the second world war, and recipient of honours including the Military Cross, a knighthood (1986), CH (2002) and OM (2005). Yet he also had a non-conformist streak, reflected in his support throughout the cold war years for tempering nuclear deterrence with moderation and for practical measures of arms control. Nonconformism also infused other aspects of his life. The 21 years he spent at King\u2019s began in 1947 with a lectureship in the history department, covering Europe from 1500 to 1914. It was on the strength of his first big book, The Coldstream Guards 1920\u20131946 (1951, co-authored with John Sparrow) \u2013 which he later played down as \u201cmy regimental war history\u201d \u2013 that he was appointed in 1953 to a newly created lectureship in military studies at King\u2019s. This appointment, enabling him to escape the history department, where he had not been happy, was made at a time when the world was still trying to digest the implications of the first tests of thermonuclear weapons by the US and USSR. In the next 10 years, he embarked on a \u201cvoyage of discovery\u201d. He had to acquire at least an acquaintance with various technologies, civil-military relations, defence decision-making and revolutionary war. His writing was sometimes stronger on generalisation than on detail. \u201cI had to skim the surface of many disciplines without having the chance thoroughly to master any one.\u201d His first book contribution to policy debates, Disengagement in Europe, came in 1958, the year that the then Institute of Strategic Studies was founded. Its subject, possible force reductions in central Europe, was controversial: Michael\u2019s voice was recognised as calm and wise. At the same time he was deeply alarmed about the possibility of nuclear war. Over 40 years later he revealed to me that in 1958 he had obtained by unofficial channels two suicide pills, as a precautionary measure because of his concern about what to do in the event of a nuclear war. He said he had recently got rid of the pills, but kept the envelope in which they had come. He indicated that his worries had probably resulted from a combination of factors \u2014 the disputes over Berlin, and the \u201cuse them or lose them\u201d nature of surface-based and liquid-fuelled missiles of that time; and that in the 1980s, at the time of controversies about nuclear missiles at Greenham Common and elsewhere, he was again very worried. Military history remained at the centre of his work. His masterpiece, The Franco-Prussian War (1961), reflected his interest in the changing nature of war and the role of force in the process of German unification in the 1860s and 70s. He viewed France\u2019s decision to go to war as catastrophic. In writing this book, Michael had from 1958 engaged as a research assistant Mark James, whose help was acknowledged in the preface. From 1961 onwards, apart from two years when Mark was teaching in Ghana, they lived together. In 1964 they bought a house in the village of Eastbury, Berkshire \u2013 initially as a weekend and holiday retreat from London-based jobs, and later as a main home. There they pursued shared interests in music and gardening. At first the relationship had to be discreet and a distinction drawn between public and private. In 1963 Michael was appointed professor of war studies at King\u2019s, where his pre-eminent achievement was building up the department of war studies and recruiting to it an impressive and intellectually diverse group of scholars. It attracted graduate students from near and far. He consolidated his reputation as a writer and broadcaster on military issues. In 1968, three days after the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia, he gave a talk on BBC Radio\u2019s Third Programme showing cool judgment about an event that unnerved many. While recognising all the reasons why this was seen as a disaster that stirred deep emotions, he argued cogently that it actually reinforced the case for building up contacts with communist countries. Later that year he moved to Oxford, as a fellow in higher defence studies, one of several posts established on the initiative of the Ministry of Defence. In 1977 he was elected Chichele professor of the history of war. Both positions were at All Souls College, from which he contributed to the growth of graduate studies in military subjects and international relations throughout the university. Then in 1980 he became regius professor of modern history, an appointment in which the prime minister had the final say. Some commented that he got the job because Margaret Thatcher liked his views, but such muttering diminished greatly over time. As regius professor (and now at Oriel College) he had to devote himself mainly to the faculty of modern history, helping to steer through some overdue reforms to Oxford\u2019s excessively anglocentric syllabus. His record of publication in his 21 years at Oxford was formidable. Nine major books in that period included the volume in the UK Official History of the Second World War on Grand Strategy (1972), the authoritative translation of Carl von Clausewitz\u2019s On War (with Peter Paret, 1976), a gem-like survey of War in European History (1976), and the deeply reflective War and the Liberal Conscience (1978). He also published an edited collection, Restraints on War (1979), that successfully explored the impact of the laws of war in recent history. One major work done at Oxford was published only later. He wrote Strategic Deception (1990), a volume of the official history of British Intelligence in the second world war. The research into it, on which he embarked in the mid-70s, required him to undergo positive vetting procedures. (Grand Strategy had called for more modest vetting.) A relatively low-grade vetting officer went through the motions of saying he assumed there was no question of Howard being a communist or homosexual. The answer came: \u201cI am a homosexual: let\u2019s get that out of the way.\u201d In later questioning, the Security Service came up with some titbits of information demonstrating impressive assiduity (a note to Guy Burgess, a library request by Mark for a map of the Danish coast), but Michael and Mark passed the test \u2013 remarkably, as at that time homosexuality was generally viewed as an automatic bar to PV clearance. After Strategic Deception was completed, its publication was held up for 10 years by Thatcher, worried about revealing how the intelligence services operated. The book appeared only in the last year of her premiership. In 1989, a year before he was due to retire from Oxford, Michael resigned from the regius chair to go to the US as professor of military and naval history at Yale University. This post enabled him to extend his active teaching career to the age of 70. At Yale, Mark was listed as a spouse, and Michael produced The Lessons of History (1991) and a co-edited volume on The Laws of War (1994). Born in London, Michael was the youngest of the three sons of Geoffrey Howard, chairman of Howard and Sons, a pharmaceutical firm, and his wife, Edith (nee Edinger), from a German Jewish family. The family lived in South Kensington and gradually spent more time in Ashmore, Dorset. Among the Howards there were strong anti-war and humanitarian traditions: Geoffrey and his sons were Anglican, while Michael\u2019s aunt Elizabeth Fox Howard, a Quaker, helped objectors in 1914-18, and was later to be active in assisting victims of the Nazis.

      "bodyText": "Channel 4 has pulled an episode of Gogglebox over fears it may have prejudiced the forthcoming trial of the former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond on sexual assault charges, including attempted rape. The programme, where families are recorded at home making comments about the previous week\u2019s television, is likely to have been seen by millions of people when it was first broadcast on Friday night. In the episode members of the Derby-based Siddiqui family are seen making comments about Salmond while discussing the performance of Scotland\u2019s current first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, during a televised leaders debate. Both Salmond\u2019s legal team and the Scottish Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecuting the case, are aware of the broadcast, according to the Scottish Sunday Mail. A spokesperson for Channel 4 confirmed it was aware of the concerns. \u201cWe are looking into this and have taken the episode from the schedule in the meantime.\u201d A planned repeat of the programme has been cancelled, while the episode of the hit programme is also unavailable on the channel\u2019s All 4 catchup service. Scotland has far stricter rules on what can be said in relation to live court cases than the rest of the UK. Salmond is due to stand trial in March charged with 14 offences, including an attempted rape, one intent to rape, 10 sexual assaults and two indecent assaults, allegedly committed while he was the first minister and the Scottish National party leader. Some of the incidents are alleged to have taken place in a bedroom at Bute House, the property in Edinburgh used as the official residence of Scotland\u2019s first ministers. Salmond has said he will vigorously defend himself against all the charges when the case comes to court.",

The case has already captured significant public attention in Queensland, deeply embarrassed the state\u2019s police service and highlighted challenges for vulnerable and marginalised people seeking justice. Julie* had her address and other personal details leaked by a police officer to her abusive former partner. In March she won a case in the Queensland civil and administrative tribunal which found the Queensland police service was liable for the breach of her privacy. Police are attempting to appeal the finding, but the process has been in limbo for eight months because a government lawyer filed paperwork after the 28-day deadline had expired. The tribunal was due to hold a hearing on 4 December to decide whether to accept the appeal. Last month police asked for the hearing to be moved because its preferred barrister, a Queen\u2019s counsel, was not available on 4 December. The government lawyer responsible for filing the late appeal documents \u2013 who may be required to give evidence about the bungle \u2013 was scheduled to go on annual leave for most of December and January. In a submission to the tribunal, police argued it would be \u201cagainst the interests of justice\u201d if they could not brief their preferred QC against the self-represented woman, and suggested the only suitable date this year was 2 December. Otherwise police said a hearing would have to wait until February. The tribunal asked Julie to respond to a suggestion the hearing be held at a \u201clater date\u201d and she replied by saying that any delay would \u201ccause further harm and detriment\u201d. Late on Thursday afternoon \u2013 with one business day\u2019s notice \u2013 the tribunal changed the date, bringing forward the hearing to Monday 2 December. The following day Julie wrote to her Queensland civil and administrative tribunal case manager to say she was unavailable to attend on Monday. \u201cNo one from the tribunal has bothered or considered to ask my availability,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOne day\u2019s notice is not sufficient.

      "bodyText": "Westpac\u2019s money laundering and child exploitation crisis has rocked the bank and thrown harsh light on the behaviour of the rest of the financial services sector. It\u2019s also raised questions about why Australia lags in enforcing rules about monitoring potentially dodgy transactions. According to allegations by Austrac, Australia\u2019s financial intelligence agency, Westpac broke the law more than 23 million times in transactions worth more than $11bn. Most of those transactions relate to its failure to file reports about international funds transfers, but Austrac\u2019s most shocking allegations relate to thousands of transactions with the Philippines that fit a pattern consistent with child exploitation that the bank did not detect or block. The allegations \u2013 and a looming fine likely to run into the billions \u2013 have enraged Westpac\u2019s investors, who last week forced the resignation of its chairman, Lindsay Maxsted, its chief executive, Brian Hartzer, and the head of its board\u2019s risk committee, Ewen Crouch. But they have also provoked concerns about the ability of the big banks to comply with the law, drawing a warning from ratings agency S&amp;P that compliance across the industry is weak and likely to be a drag on profits for the next two years. Meanwhile Austrac appears to be working its way through the big four banks. It has already dragged two of them, Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank, into court for allegedly breaching the law and a third, NAB, says it is under investigation. This week the last of the quartet, ANZ, said that as far as it knew it was not under investigation but said it has been reviewing its compliance with the laws since June. Poor culture and weak laws \u201cMisconduct in our financial industry is a result of a significant deterioration in culture precipitated \u2013 for in excess of a decade \u2013 by a relentless drive for record profits, year after year,\u201d says Andy Schlumow, a regulatory consultant and law lecturer at the University of Wollongong. \u201cInvestments in infrastructure have not been made \u2013 like IT platforms capable of complying with a bank\u2019s anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations; obligations laid down in legislation, and integral to their licence conditions.\u201d At a higher level still, despite a review process that has been under way for more than a decade, the Australian government has stalled the process of bringing the nation\u2019s laws up to international standards through changes that include adding lawyers and real estate agents to the list of people required to report suspicious transactions to Austrac. There is no sign the Morrison government will take action any time soon, even though it has promised international authorities it will bring Australian regulations up to scratch. The gargantuan home affairs ministry, headed by the former Queensland cop Peter Dutton, has responsibility for anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism finance. But despite Dutton\u2019s tough talk against Westpac \u2013 earlier this week he slammed the bank for giving \u201ca free pass to paedophiles\u201d \u2013 he would not commit the government to introducing legislation that would bring Australia up to international standards. \u201cThe Morrison government is committed to continually improving Australia\u2019s anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws and working with industry to ensure that Australia\u2019s financial system is hardened against criminals and terrorists without placing undue burden on industry,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cAny potential future reforms will be reviewed in a careful and considered way.\u201d The push for more data Anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws seldom troubled newspaper front pages until 2017 and the CBA case, with its allegations of ATMs stuffed with cash reaped from drug and gun-running. The laws require banks and other financial institutions to make a steady flow of reports to Austrac about international payments, suspicious transfers and large sums of cash changing hands. They are also supposed to detect and stop transfers likely to be associated with criminal activity. The alleged failure that has Westpac in trouble is that at least a dozen customers made transfers to the Philippines that were consistent with child exploitation for years, without the bank doing anything about it. Austrac analyses the mountains of data it collects and shares it with other law enforcement agencies, including police and the Taxation Office. \u201cWe get valuable insights from the information provided to us by Austrac, which we use in our compliance activities, particularly in identifying and chasing down offshore tax evasion,\u201d the ATO\u2019s second commissioner, Jeremy Hirschhorn, told the Guardian. \u201cThe higher the quality and completeness of that data the better from our perspective.\u201d Since 2007, moves have been under way to increase this flow of data by making other businesses that regularly deal with large amounts of money on behalf of their clients, including estate agents and lawyers, contribute reports to Austrac. The push, known as \u201cphase 2\u201d, stalled during the global financial crisis, but by December 2013 the Abbott government put it back on the agenda as part of a regular review of Australia\u2019s anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism finance legislation. However, that review was put on ice while Australia was evaluated at the hands of the financial action taskforce, a multinational group that sets international standards for money-laundering laws and works out of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s headquarters in Paris. When it arrived in April 2014 the taskforce\u2019s evaluation was stinging, calling out Australia for failing to focus on money laundering and for not having yet brought \u201creal estate agents and lawyers, which the authorities assessed as high risk for money laundering and terrorist financing\u201d into the reporting scheme. The criticism shocked Austrac into adopting a more aggressive approach, reflected in its recent assaults on the banking sector and its recent investigation into buy-now pay-later fintech Afterpay. \u201cRecent changes at Austrac have seen considerable improvement,\u201d a payments consultant, Grant Halverson, said. \u201cThe majority of recent work however is on self-reported issues by banks \u2013 not investigation and detection.\u201d He said other examples of low detection rates included whistleblower reports of bags full of cash being exchanged for chips at Crown Casino, as well as the activities of the accused Christchurch mass murderer in the lead-up to the massacre. While Austrac took action, the government responded to the taskforce\u2019s critique with yet another round of consultation in 2016, looking at options to regulate real estate agents, lawyers and other high-risk groups that fall into what in anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism finance jargon are known as \u201cdesignated non-financial businesses and professions\u201d. Lawyers resist tougher compliance regime A major source of resistance has been lawyers, who have consistently said the requirement to report suspicious transactions conflicts with their duty of confidence towards their clients. In a submission to the review, the Law Council of Australia also questioned whether the Financial Action Task Force regime made any difference at all to the level of money laundering and complained that compliance would cost the profession more than $2bn annually. A Law Council spokesman said the organisation still held the views expressed in the submission. A decade of inaction meant that by the middle of next year Australia was once again due for a bruising encounter with the Financial Action Task Force over its failure to bring in phase 2. But the Financial Action Task Force has granted Australia a reprieve by freezing all evaluations until a strategic review of the organisation is finished. \u201cIn October, the [Financial Action Task Force] decided to temporarily pause the start of all scheduled follow-up assessments \u2013 this is not an Australia specific decision,\u201d an Financial Action Task Force spokesman said. But Australia still faces a looming international showdown in three months, at the task force\u2019s next meeting in February. \u201cAs a member of the [Financial Action Task Force], Australia has committed to fully and effectively implement all of the [Financial Action Task Force] recommendations, including those that concern \u2018designated non-financial businesses and professions\u2019,\u201d the spokesman said.",

There are a range of espionage charges under Chinese law, carrying penalties from three years imprisonment to execution. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Previous reports of Yang\u2019s interrogations suggest he has been repeatedly told he faces execution, that his country has abandoned him, and his family and friends have betrayed him. \u201cA [ministry of state security] investigation officer told me that Australia was small and wouldn\u2019t care about me,\u201d the writer said in a message relayed from detention earlier this month. \u201cHe said Australia was dependent on China for its trade and economy, and Canberra wouldn\u2019t help me, let alone rescue me. \u201cHe said Australia wouldn\u2019t help because I am not white. This is nonsense. He was wrong.\u201d Yang\u2019s former doctoral supervisor in Australia, Dr Feng Chongyi, said he believed \u201cthe Chinese authorities want to wind up the case and convict Yang\u201d. \u201cBut they have not got the evidence, therefore they have renewed and increased the pressure to \u2018break\u2019 him and coerce a confession from him,\u201d Feng, an associate professor in China Studies at the University of Technology Sydney, said. Fifty-four-year-old Yang, whose legal name in Yang Jun, was born in Hubei in central China. He was formerly a diplomat for China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, before working in the private sector in Hong Kong and moving to Australia, then to the US. A writer of spy novels, he has been a popular blogger, political commentator and agitator for democratic reforms in China for more than a decade. Yang, who became an Australian citizen in 2002, had been living in the United States, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University, before flying to Guangzhou with his family in January. His wife and child were able to enter China, but authorities escorted Yang from the plane into detention. He was initially held under a system known as \u201cresidential surveillance at a designated location\u201d, a type of secret detention of up to six months in which authorities can deny a suspect access to lawyers and to family, and restrict external communication. In July Yang was moved to a Beijing detention centre in the lead-up to being charged. Yang\u2019s long-running detention continues at a time of acute strain in relations between Canberra and Beijing, with Australia in the so-called \u201cdiplomatic freezer\u201d, enjoying little high-level access to the regime. And with relations already laboured over a laundry-list of issues \u2013 Chinese telco Huawei\u2019s 5G ban by Australia\u2019s Foreign Investment Review Board; allegations of Chinese interference in Australian education and political systems; and Beijing\u2019s military expansionism in the South China Sea \u2013 allegations aired in the Australian media last week that a self-declared China spy has sought to defect have angered the Chinese regime further. An editorial in the state-run China Daily said Australia was \u201closing the plot\u201d. \u201cA \u2018China threat\u2019 storm is building in Australia. If unchecked, this ill wind, which has been blowing steadily in recent years and taken its toll on China-Australia ties, will gain enough force to shatter the foundations of bilateral interaction.\u201d Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, has previously raised Yang\u2019s case with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, saying Australia held \u201cserious concerns\u201d for Yang\u2019s welfare and the conditions of his detention. She said there was \u201cno basis\u201d for any allegation he was a spy. A spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, Geng Shuang, has warned Australia against \u201cinterference\u201d in the case. \u201cChina deplores the Australian statement on this case \u2026 the Australian side should earnestly respect China\u2019s judicial sovereignty and must not ... interfere with a Chinese case,\u201d he said. He said Yang\u2019s arrest had been handled in accordance with the law and that the Australian citizen was in good health.",

      "bodyText": "Almost 250 years after James Cook\u2019s arrival paved the way for Indigenous dispossession, federal parliament will debate a call for the return of countless thousands of looted Aboriginal artefacts, many of which remain in the British Museum. A Labor motion calls on the federal government to intensify efforts to cooperate with other countries, especially Britain, to hasten return of Aboriginal cultural materials \u2013 including ancestral human remains \u2013 in the name of \u201ctruth telling\u201d. This is long overdue. Australian parliamentary and government inaction on stolen sacred Indigenous cultural material and human remains in foreign collecting institutions, is a continuing insult to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\u2019 spiritual sensibility. The motion will test the questionable bona fides on First Nations issues of the federal government, which has refused to countenance the call from the 2018 Uluru convention for a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice to parliament. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, holds the electorate of Cook, which includes the place where the British lieutenant first stepped on to the continent that became Australia. Morrison is an ardent booster of Cook\u2019s part in the Australian story and in the formation of our national identity. He has committed some $50m \u2013 including for new memorials in his electorate \u2013 to the sestercentennial of the arrival at Kamay (Botany Bay) of the HMS Endeavour during the first of the lieutenant\u2019s three voyages of discovery. On the afternoon Endeavour anchored at Kamay and Cook went ashore, his crew promptly fired at Indigenous men, wounding at least one. His men then stole what has become known as the Gweagal Shield and spears that the Indigenous men dropped. The shield has an apparent musket hole. The shield has been central to the British Museum\u2019s Indigenous Australian collection of some 6,000 items, many questionably acquired. The museum has refused repeated requests from descendants of the Kamay men involved in that moment of violent first contact \u2013 including Rodney Kelly \u2013 for the return of the artefacts. The spears are in Cambridge at the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. The museum has not, however, ruled out the option of long-term \u201cloans\u201d of Indigenous artefacts to Aboriginal cultural and other Australian institutions. In 2015 the British Museum loaned the Gweagal Shield and other artefacts to the National Museum of Australia for its controversial Encounters exhibition \u2013 but only after the federal Labor government legislated the Protection of Cultural Objects on Loan Act, rendering Aboriginal items loaned back to Australia legally immune from Indigenous claim. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Matt Thistlethwaite, the member for Kingsford Smith which includes La Perouse \u2013 the oldest continuous Indigenous settlement in Sydney and home to Gweagal descendants \u2013 is due to move the parliamentary motion on Monday afternoon. Wiradjuri woman Linda Burney, the member for Barton, which shares a boundary with Cook and incorporates part of the Kamay shore, will second it. It \u201cacknowledges \u2026 that during Captain Cook\u2019s expedition to Australia in 1770 a number of Aboriginal artefacts and cultural heritage materials were taken from local Aboriginal people and removed to Great Britain and other countries \u2026 [that] many of these cultural heritage materials are now on display or housed in museums and colleges in Great Britain and other countries\u201d. The motion \u201crecognises the historical, cultural and heritage significance of such cultural heritage materials to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and Australian history \u2026 that such cultural items, where possible, should be returned to the original custodians and owners; and \u2026 that these cultural materials play an important role in truth telling about Captain Cook\u2019s expedition and British settlement in Australia.\u201d The motion acknowledges the government-funded Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies has been intensifying efforts to return Indigenous cultural materials held overseas to rightful Aboriginal owners. In his speech to the motion, Thistlethwaite writes: \u201cWhen Cook\u2019s expedition left our shores they took with them the sovereignty of the First Australians over a land they had nurtured and inhabited for tens of thousands of years. They also took with them some of the symbols of that sovereignty \u2013 cultural artefacts, materials and human remains passed down through generations through the longest continuing connection with a land on the planet. \u201cWhen Cook and his crew left Botany Bay they had in their possession many spears, shields and other cultural pieces that tell an important story about our nation\u2019s true history ... They belong with their creators\u2019 decedents ... The 250th anniversary of Cook\u2019s landing is the perfect opportunity to announce an agreement with the British government on a process to identify and repatriate historic Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artefacts and remains and I call on the Morrison government to make this an important priority for next year\u2019s commemoration.\u201d British collecting institutions \u2013 especially the British Museum \u2013 are, however, rarely of a mind to return artefacts, ill-gotten during colonial rule, as the human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson recently pointed out. He criticised the British Museum over its continued intransigence on its troves of \u201cstolen\u201d colonial loot \u2013 not least the Elgin Marbles. He said: \u201cThe trustees of the British Museum have become the world\u2019s largest receivers of stolen property, and the great majority of their loot is not even on public display.\u201d Hear hear. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 December 2019 because the spears are in Cambridge at the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, not at the British Museum as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.",

After outlining a non-negotiable \u2013 but undisclosed \u2013 condition for securing her support, Lambie told Guardian Australia that the government was prepared to discuss her demand, saying the \u201cdoor is wide open\u201d. While the key crossbencher has refused to disclose details of her ultimatum, saying it relates to issues of national security, it has been reported that she wants the Coalition to accept the offer from New Zealand to take 150 refugees from offshore detention. Lambie has not denied the report. \u201cI am certainly in discussion with the prime minister and minister Dutton, and there are no doubts about that, the door is wide open,\u201d Lambie said. \u201cBut to try and get deals done up here and to try to achieve something better, these negotiations need to stay very, very tight, and there are national security sensitivities,\u201d she said. The office of the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Adern, told Guardian Australia that there had been no recent discussions with the Australian government about the resettlement offer, but said the country\u2019s position was well known and had not changed. Last year, Dutton said he was open to considering the New Zealand deal providing those who were transferred never came to Australia, but has consistently said the government is not prepared to do deals with the Senate crossbench on national security legislation. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the medevac laws were working as intended, but he also called for the government to accept the New Zealand resettlement offer. \u201cThe government should accept the offer that has been made by New Zealand. It would provide a practical outcome, it would be good not just for the people concerned but also it would be good for the budget because it (offshore detention) is costing an enormous amount of money from Australian taxpayers,\u201d Albanese said. Ahead of the final sitting week of 2019, Lambie also indicated she was prepared to negotiate on the government\u2019s ensuring integrity legislation, which the coalition will reintroduce to parliament this week after suffering a humiliating defeat at the hands of One Nation on Thursday. Lambie has criticised the government for sidelining her in negotiations, saying it had wrongly assumed the two Senate votes controlled by Pauline Hanson were in the bag. Speaking on the ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday, Lambie said she was \u201copen to talks\u201d with the government on the union crackdown, particularly on amendments that would force the CFMEU to \u201cclean up its act\u201d. \u201cThere is no doubt, he (Christian Porter) believed he had this locked in. So that put us on the sidelines. That has now changed, and I\u2019m certainly open for discussion on the bill,\u201d Lambie said. \u201cThey (the CFMEU) have some cleaning up to do in their own backyard \u2026 and I\u2019d like to see that done as quickly as possible, otherwise we will be talking about this bill in the new year.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The resources minister, Matt Canavan, said Hanson\u2019s decision to vote against the ensuring integrity bill showed the Queenslander was taking voters for \u201cmugs\u201d. \u201cWhen you vote for minor parties and independents it\u2019s often the Forrest Gump story \u2013 you just don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get,\u201d Canavan told Sky News on Sunday. \u201cI think Pauline here is trying to take the Australian people as mugs.\u201d Canavan criticised Hanson\u2019s \u201camazing backflip\u201d on the legislation, which she claimed was because of the government\u2019s failure to crack down on white collar crime in the wake of the Westpac money laundering and child exploitation scandal. But Canavan said it was \u201ca pretty remarkable argument\u201d to not crack down on one \u201cbad group\u201d because of the behaviour of another. \u201cThe most important currency you\u2019ve got in politics is trust and Pauline Hanson has shown over the last week she can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d Canavan said. The government is expected to reintroduce the ensuring integrity legislation to the House of Representatives again this week. As the Coalition seeks to secure a parliamentary win before the end of the year, Albanese said the opposition would continue to keep the pressure on the government over a police investigation into the energy minister Angus Taylor\u2019s use of dodgy documents to attack the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore. \u201cMinister Taylor has had three months to resolve this issue, come into parliament and just say where the documentation came from.

      "bodyText": "When is an emergency really an emergency? If you\u2019re the captain of the Titanic, approaching a giant iceberg with the potential to sink your ship becomes an emergency only when you realise you might not have enough time to steer a safe course. And so it is, says Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, when it comes to the climate emergency. Knowing how long societies have to react to pull the brake on the Earth\u2019s climate and then how long it will take for the ship to slow down is the difference between a climate emergency and a manageable problem. Rather than being something abstract and open to interpretation, Schellnhuber says the climate emergency is something with clear and calculable risks that you could put into a formula. And so he wrote one. Emergency = R \u00d7 U = p \u00d7 D \u00d7 \u03c4 / T In a comment article in the journal Nature, Schellnhuber and colleagues explained that to understand the climate emergency we needed to quantify the relationship between risk (R) and urgency (U). Borrowing from the insurance industry, the scientists define risk (R) as the probability of something happening (p) multiplied by damage (D). For example, how likely is it that sea levels will rise by a metre and how much damage will that cause. Urgency (U) is the time it takes you to react to an issue (\u03c4) \u201cdivided by the intervention time left to avoid a bad outcome (T)\u201d, they wrote. Schellnhuber, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, tells Guardian Australia the work on the formula was just the \u201ctip of a mathematical iceberg\u201d in defining the climate emergency. \u201cIt can be illustrated by the Titanic disaster, but it applies to many severe risks where you can calculate the do-nothing/business-as-usual probability of a highly damaging event,\u201d he says. \u201cYet there are options to avoid the disaster. \u201cIn other words, this a control problem.\u201d There is a time lag between the rapid cuts to greenhouse gases and the climate system reacting. Knowing if you have enough time tells you if you\u2019re in an emergency or not. Schellnhuber used \u201cstandard risk analysis and control theory\u201d to come up with the formula, and he was already putting numbers to it. \u201cAs a matter of fact, the intervention time left for limiting global warming to less than 2C is about 30 [years] at best. The reaction time \u2013 time needed for full global decarbonisation - is at least 20 [years].\u201d As the scientists write in Nature, if the \u201creaction time is longer than the intervention time left\u201d then \u201cwe have lost control\u201d. Schellnhuber says: \u201cBeyond that critical point, only some sort of adaptation option is left, such as moving the Titanic passengers into rescue boats (if available).\u201d Earlier this month, Oxford Dictionaries announced \u201cclimate emergency\u201d as the word of the year, defining it as \u201ca situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it\u201d. One website tracking climate emergency declarations says 1,195 jurisdictions in 25 countries, representing 454 million people, have already voted on the emergency. This week the European parliament joined them, as did Ballina shire council in northern New South Wales, the 76th local government authority in Australia to make the declaration. Prof Will Steffen, of the Australian National University and the Stockholm Resilience Centre, and a co-author of the article, says: \u201cEmergency can mean many things to many people. But there are some hard numbers behind why so many people are saying we are in a climate emergency. \u201cThis formula sharpens our thinking. So we have 30 years to decarbonise and to stabilise our pressure on the climate system.\u201d In the Nature article, the scientists highlight nine \u201ctipping points\u201d that, if crossed, become almost impossible to stop. At least five are already \u201cactive\u201d. Some of them, like melting permafrost or forest degradation, can start to add more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, making the job of keeping global temperatures down even harder. \u201cThere are a range of these intervention times left,\u201d Steffen says. \u201cHow long do we have before [the Greenland ice sheet] goes? Maybe we have 20 to 25 years and then we might be committed to losing Greenland. \u201cBut the time we have left to intervene to stabilise coral reefs, for example, is a lot less than 30 years. \u201cOur reaction time has to be fast and to decarbonise by 2050 we have to really move now. That\u2019s the point of [Schellnhuber\u2019s] maths. \u201cTo err on the side of danger is a stupid thing to do.\u201d",

They valued her contributions enormously and were inspired by her determination to push towards the good.\u201d She said everyone at the institute would \u201cmiss Jack\u2019s quiet humour and rigorous intellect\u201d, adding: \u201cHis determined belief in rehabilitation inspired him to join the institute as a staff member to work in the Learning Together research team after completing his MPhil in criminology in 2017. \u201cJack\u2019s passion for social and criminal justice was infectious. He was deeply creatively and courageously engaged with the world, advocating for a politics of love. He worked tirelessly in dark places to pull towards the light.\u201d Gelsthorpe also thanked other members of the Learning Together community \u201cwho bravely risked their own lives to hold off the attacker until the police arrived\u201d. Olivia Smith, a lecturer in criminology at Loughborough university, said: \u201cSaskia Jones was one of those students makes you so proud to be in this job. I\u2019m so sorry that the world won\u2019t get to see what she could have achieved. She was one of a kind and loved justice, she would have been a force for good and I\u2019m so sorry for us all that we\u2019ve lost her.\u201d Cambridge University\u2019s vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen J Toope, said on Sunday: \u201cI am devastated to learn that among the victims of the London Bridge attack were staff and alumni of the University of Cambridge, taking part in an event to mark five years of the Learning Together programme. \u201cWhat should have been a joyous opportunity to celebrate the achievements of this unique and socially transformative programme, hosted by our Institute of Criminology, was instead disrupted by an unspeakable criminal act.\u201d He added: \u201cOur university condemns this abhorrent and senseless act of terror. Our condolences, our thoughts and our deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families.\u201d Floral tributes have been laid on the south side of London Bridge and hundreds attended a service on Sunday at Southwark Cathedral for the victims of the attack. The cathedral, which is next to London Bridge, was put into lockdown during the attack with members of the public taking refuge in its walls. For many it brought back memories of the terror attack at nearby Borough Market in 2017. The NHS said one of the people injured in the attack had been allowed to return home and two others remained in a stable condition. Dr Vin Diwakar, the medical director for the NHS in London, paid tribute to hospital and ambulance staff. \u201cOur thoughts remain with the families and friends of those who sadly lost their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the people injured in the London Bridge incident has now been able to return home. Two people remain in a stable condition and continue to receive expert care in hospital. \u201cWhile the NHS is now dealing with immediate physical injuries, the psychological impact of such events sometimes only comes to light in the days and weeks afterwards.\u201d PA Media contributed to this report",

It stems from Kenny McLean driving into space before spreading play to Onel Hern\u00e1ndez, who raided into a huge hole vacated by Chambers, who had gone walkabout. Hern\u00e1ndez showed composure to slide the ball across for Cantwell, who curled a wonderful strike into the corner. Placement, not power. An effortless finish. His celebration is a cracker, too; a Peter Crouch robot of sorts. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40d5edbf18ad32115aca89a993dd98c27fa35f12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40d5edbf18ad32115aca89a993dd98c27fa35f12/0_0_2801_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cantwell scores the second for Norwich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cantwell scores the second for Norwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Radburn/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6d4172d918ce2abf1685bb45a0d44ccd576f11a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6d4172d918ce2abf1685bb45a0d44ccd576f11a/0_0_4848_2975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cantwell celebrates.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"614\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cantwell celebrates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JASONPIX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-01T14:58:03.585Z\">at 2.58pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de3d2028f087410d987622f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-01T14:46:07.890Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>45 min: </strong>There will be three added minutes at the end of a richly entertaining half.

They ditched the private jet and hopped on to the team bus for this season\u2019s visit to Carrow Road after taking flak for chartering a 14-minute flight from Luton airport to Norfolk four years ago. How times have changed. Not only that but Freddie Ljungberg is now in the hot-seat after Arsenal sent Unai Emery packing with his P45. Ljungberg, who has whet supporters appetite by declaring his love for va-va-voom football will be ably assisted by former defender and Big F ... Per Mertesacker. Fifty-six days have passed since Arsenal\u2019s last win in the Premier League (against Eddie Howe\u2019s Bournemouth at the start of October) and, in terms of performance, surely anything will be an improvement on Thursday\u2019s abject defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt, Emery\u2019s final game in charge. \u201cHowever long I oversee Arsenal for I will give everything I have to put smiles back on faces again,\u201d says Ljungberg, who faces competition from the former Juventus manager Max Allegri for the permanent gig. Norwich, meanwhile, will be keen to build on that away win at Everton last time out. \u201cWe\u2019re not too down after disappointing results and weren\u2019t too high after the Everton win,\u201d says Daniel Farke. \u201cWe remain the underdogs in every game, especially against Arsenal.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company. Bye! Read Nick Ames\u2019s match report: Do join John Brewin for Leicester v Everton: Some Norwich reaction. \u201cI think naturally it\u2019s a good point at home against a strong team but we had chances to get something more,\u201d says Todd Cantwell. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on the composure to try and take the chances you get in this team.\u201d As for Tim Krul, he seems to have mellowed since that first-half penalty. \u201cFor me the job is to get into the striker\u2019s head and make him doubt himself,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was frustrating it had to be retaken.\u201d Eight games without victory for Arsenal, their longest winless run in 25 years. It is 38 days since their last win, a last-gasp 3-2 victory against Vitoria at the Emirates and, by the time they entertain Brighton on Thursday, it will be 60 days since their last Premier League win. Leno was outstanding for Arsenal, while Aubameyang and Guendouzi were probably the best of the rest. For Norwich, plenty of encouragement to take into Wednesday\u2019s trip to Southampton. Max Aarons, Ben Godfrey, Todd Cantwell, Onel Hern\u00e1ndez and Teemu Pukki all shone. That\u2019s yer lot! A thoroughly entertaining encounter. Ljungberg puffs his cheeks in disappointment as the whistle blows but Norwich deserved at least a point. If anything, Bernd Leno prevented Daniel Farke\u2019s side from taking all three with Arsenal\u2019s defence repeatedly found wanting. Elsewhere, it finished 1-1 at Molineux between Wolves and Sheffield United. 90+4 min: A crucial block by Amadou prevents Torreira\u2019s shot from troubling Krul. Norwich then scamper upfield. What an end-to-end finish! 90+4 min: Into the final minute ... 90+3 min: Zimmerman clears. With his head, not his hands. 90+2 min: Leno smothers after Pukki eludes Mustafi! Leno has kept Arsenal in this game. The visitors, though, now win a corner ... 90+1 min: Leno makes a superb two-handed save to deny Norwich! It is a brilliant stop after Aarons\u2019 shot horribly deflected off Torreira. Aarons did brilliantly to burst forward into the box. There will be four minutes of added time. 90 min: Martinelli replaces Mesut \u00d6zil in Ljungberg\u2019s final throw of the dice. Norwich are still pursuing a winner. Can they? 89 min: Norwich almost walk the ball into the net but Trybull is caught a yard offside. Emi Buend\u00eda is the catalyst; he\u2019s been lively since coming on. Buend\u00eda was magnificent in the Championship last season. 88 min: Another Norwich corner. Aarons \u2013 again \u2013 does brilliantly ... 87 min: Norwich win a corner. There is a bit of handbags between McLean and Kolasinac after the latter gets up in the Norwich midfielder\u2019s grill at desperately appealing for handball \u2013 it wasn\u2019t. The VAR checks it, and then checks for a red card. Nothing doing. 86 min: Emi Buend\u00eda and Onel Hern\u00e1ndez probe down the left, with Norwich, too, confident of finding a winner. Aubameyang, of all people, is back at right-wing back hoovering up. 84 min: Arsenal are trying to fashion a winner but Norwich are hounding them and making life difficult. Up in the stands food for thought for Edu, the Arsenal technical director. Arsenal have not been disastrous but it has hardly been a convincing performance. 83 min: Cantwell, who has had a stormer for Norwich, is replaced by Emi Buend\u00eda. Less than seven minutes of normal time to play. 82 min: Norwich are readying a change of their own ... 79 min: Amadou giftwraps Arsenal a chance but Krul rushes from one end of his goal the other, ultimately proving Norwich\u2019s saviour! It was a careless, aimless pass by Amadou into no man\u2019s land and Aubameyang was lurking. But Krul did well to intervene. 78 min: Saka replaces Guendouzi. 76 min: Bukayo Saka is stripped and ready for action. The 18-year-old is very much a Ljungberg player having worked with him in the academy. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, too, has been warming up. 72 min: Cantwell almost bustles his way through and finds a third for Norwich! The midfielder plays a one-two with McLean on the edge of the box and everybody in an Arsenal shirt seems to stop. But not Cantwell, who piles into the box before David Luiz wakes to intervene. Elsewhere, it remains 1-1 at Molineux. 70 min: Lucas Torreira replaces Willock. 69 min: Leno makes a decent save from the resulting free-kick. It was flashed towards the back post but it\u2019s no real trouble for Arsenal, who earn a slice of much-needed respite. Changes are coming ... 68 min: Norwich win a free-kick 20 yards from goal. Hern\u00e1ndez did brilliantly again, skirting away from Xhaka before playing in Teemu Pukki, who was hauled down by Chambers. The Arsenal defender needs to be careful. He was booked just seconds ago. 66 min: Chambers is booked for a clumsy foul on Hern\u00e1ndez. Joe Willock seems to be in pain but is soon back up and running. 65 min: How long have Arsenal been incapable in defence? Norwich are carving them open time and again. Elsewhere, at Molineux Matt Doherty has equalised for Nuno\u2019s Wolves at home to Sheffield United. Like at Carrow Road, there is 25 minutes to play there. 63 min: Leno denies Pukki with his legs! Another huge stop by the Arsenal goalkeeper. Pukki latches on to a wondrous Cantwell through ball and promptly wrings Mustafi inside out, totally embarrassing the Arsenal defender. In doing so Pukki creates ample room to take aim \u2013 the end result seems inevitable \u2013 but Leno works wonders to keep it out. 62 min: Cantwell drags narrowly wide!! Aarons raids inside off the right flank \u2013 he has been brilliant in both boxes \u2013 and Cantwell has to take it first time and does. His left-foot shot has the beating of Leno but it drops the wrong side of the Arsenal goalkeeper\u2019s left post. Mustafi, David Luiz and co \u2013 again \u2013 were all over the shop. This Arsenal defence is dire. 59 min: Bernd Leno with a humongous save!! Arsenal switch off \u2013 Mustafi and David Luiz go missing, again \u2013 and Kenny McLean bares down on the arsenal goal. But he cannot beat the German goalkeeper, who gets a strong left hand to McLean\u2019s strike. As McLean surged through on goal, he seemed to lack belief, and then conviction. That was a massive, massive chance. Right on cue, the Arsenal captain comes up trumps. Aubameyang blasts home after Mustafi\u2019s shot from Mesut \u00d6zil\u2019s corner was blocked by Byram. That\u2019s Aubameyang\u2019s 12th goal of the season. It was a sloppy goal from a Norwich perspective. Aubameyang was unmarked six or seven yards from Tim Krul\u2019s goal. 55 min: Cantwell is penalised on the edge of the Arsenal box for a foul on Willock and Arsenal earn a chance to rebuild. Gabriel Martinelli was doing an intensive warmup at half-time. Ljungberg must be tempted to throw him on shortly. Arsenal\u2019s attacking intent has undoubtedly faded. 52 min: Mesut \u00d6zil tries to pull the ball back into the box but it\u2019s blocked by Zimmerman and Arsenal have to settle for a corner, which ultimately comes to nothing. Arsenal protest for another penalty because \u00d6zil\u2019s cross zooms off Zimmerman\u2019s hand, but it would have been extremely harsh. 50 min: Godfrey shows a brilliant turn of pace to coolly usher the ball away from Aubameyang and play it back to Krul. For a moment Norwich seemed to be under the cosh, with Willock sliding a pass into the channel for the Arsenal skipper to gallop on to but Godfrey did magnificently to hoover things up with minimal fuss. 47 min: Onel Hern\u00e1ndez makes a crunching \u2013 but fair \u2013 challenge on Aubameyang. Moments later Xhaka and McLean collide and the Norwich midfielder comes off worse. It was pretty innocuous. But McLean appears to be in plenty of pain. 46 min: Pukki gets the second half started. Half-time reading: Freddie Ljungberg\u2019s side trail at the break, with Arsenal guilty of twice being caught cold on the counterattack. For Norwich, that hoo-ha over the re-taken penalty feels a long time ago. Over at Molineux, Sheffield United lead Wolves 1-0 at the interval. Lys Mousset struck with just two minutes on the clock. Wolves have been a little lethargic, while it has been more of the same from Chris Wilder\u2019s unrelenting side. Todd Cantwell strikes for Norwich! It is a beautiful, weighted finish by the 21-year-old academy graduate. It stems from Kenny McLean driving into space before spreading play to Onel Hern\u00e1ndez, who raided into a huge hole vacated by Chambers, who had gone walkabout. Hern\u00e1ndez showed composure to slide the ball across for Cantwell, who curled a wonderful strike into the corner. Placement, not power. An effortless finish. His celebration is a cracker, too; a Peter Crouch robot of sorts. 45 min: There will be three added minutes at the end of a richly entertaining half. Guendouzi limps off but Per Mertesacker signals to the substitutes\u2019 bench that the midfielder is going to be fine. 44 min: Kenny McLean is booked for a rash challenge on Guendouzi. That was a poor tackle by the Norwich midfielder. He caught the Arsenal midfielder high on his ankle. Guendouzi requires medical attention and seems to be struggling. He\u2019s going nowhere fast. 43 min: Godfrey plays a poor pass on halfway but it goes unpunished as Xhaka then does likewise. Lacazette, who Xhaka failed to find with his pass, huffs and puffs. It\u2019s not quite happening. They were playing much more freely before Pukki opened the scoring with that deflected strike. 41 min: Guendouzi tries to slide the ball into the channel for the overlapping Kolasinac, but there is Max Aarons once again. The Norwich teenager has impressed at full-back, more so defensively this afternoon. 39 min: A frustrated Lacazette makes a crude challenge on Amadou but Tierney gives a free-kick and tells Norwich to get on with it. Onel Hern\u00e1ndez is then played in, with Xhaka for company and the Arsenal midfielder does well to crowd the winger out. Norwich win a corner, which drops for Amadou, who wellies a harmless shot wide. 37 min: A lapse by Cantwell allows Xhaka to steal in and seize possession 20 yards from goal. Xhaka does brilliantly to pickpocket the Norwich midfielder but he fails to execute the pass. Instead of rolling in Lacazette, he plays a poor pass behind the Frenchman. Just like that, the move breaks down. And Norwich get a chance to build themselves. 37 min: Paul Tierney has a stern word with Todd Cantwell for a poor challenge on Guendouzi. The Norwich midfielder is fortunate to come away from that telling off without a booking. It wasn\u2019t a great tackle. 35 min: Amadou plays Norwich into trouble, with a sloppy pass fired into Aarons, who had no chance of controlling the ball. Arsenal then break but Zimmerman, who foolishly gave away the penalty, buys a foul out of Lacazette. A little respite for Norwich, who have struggled to put a foot on the ball and control proceedings. Arsenal remain in the box seat. 34 min: Guendouzi plays a high ball in for Lacazette, but Ben Godfrey gets in front of the Frenchman to hoover up. 33 min: Norwich clear their lines but Hern\u00e1ndez cannot pick out McLean with Arsenal at sea in defence. This is a wildly open game. 31 min: Arsenal are probing in search of a second, with Guendouzi playing a wonderful give-and-go with Lacazette. Guendouzi surges into the box and Max Aarons does brilliantly to nick the ball away from the Arsenal midfielder. Aarons is fuming with Pukki for allowing Guendouzi to fly into the box unmarked. The visitors have to settle for a corner ... 30 min: As Patrice Evra says, I love this game. At the second time of asking, Aubameyang levels for Arsenal. The Arsenal skipper makes no mistake this time, sending Krul the wrong way before holding his index finger to his mouth, a little shushing gesture to the Dutchman. Needless to say Tim Krul, who has already been booked, is absolutely livid. 28 min: Aubameyang will re-take it ... 27 min: The penalty will be re-taken! Norwich are penalised for encroachment, with four yellow shirts in the box before Aubameyang made contact with the ball. A chance for a reprieve ... 26 min: Krul saves Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s penalty! The Norwich goalkeeper is booked for a few mind games before the spot-kick and Krul dives to his right to keep it out. Aarons then clears to prevent any Arsenal shirt jumping on to the rebound ... 25 min: A penalty is awarded to Arsenal ... 25 min: VAR check ... but that\u2019s a penalty, surely. 24 min: Arsenal win a penalty! Paul Tierney points to the spot! Zimmerman handles \u00d6zil\u2019s cross with his left hand ... 23 min: Ljungberg bounces out of his seat in the dugout and looks rather perplexed as to how his team trail. McLean, meanwhile, has fouled Xhaka so Arsenal have a free-kick 25 yards out. \u00d6zil will take ... They all count. It\u2019s cruel on Arsenal \u2013 it\u2019s a wicked deflection to beat Leno \u2013 but Teemu Pukki jinks inside unchallenged and finds the net. After a blistering start, Ljungberg\u2019s side trail at Carrow Road. Pukki drove inside David Luiz and the Finland striker\u2019s shot cannons off Mustafi and into the corner. 19 min: Krul denies Chambers, who heads at goal from \u00d6zil\u2019s corner! Chambers burst to the front post totally unmarked and tried to divert the ball across goal but the Norwich goalkeeper clambers it to safety. A let-off for Norwich, whose zonal marking looked shoddy there. 18 min: Kolasinac weaves inside Cantwell and Aarons before the latter eats back at his man to concede a corner ... 16 min: McLean winds up a thumping shot from 20 yards but Bernd Leno sees it all the way. It certainly did not lack power. Leno gathers. Moments earlier Arsenal swept upfield, another incisive break, kickstarted by Granit Xhaka. Chambers\u2019s final ball was Arsenal\u2019s undoing. 14 min: Kolasinac does brilliantly to shift across towards the centre of defence having sensed the danger and nicked the ball away from McLean. Chambers then does well to not only wriggle out of a tight space but pick his pass. A very assured start by Arsenal. 13 min: Cantwell clears \u00d6zil\u2019s corner. Chambers ended up nudging the ball out of play after duelling with Ben Godfrey but the referee Paul Tierney pointed for an Arsenal corner. Fortunately for Farke and co, it came to nothing. Pukki is yet to have a sniff for the hosts. 12 min: Arsenal, wrongly, win another a corner ... 10 min: Mustafi has a header cleared off the line by Onel Hern\u00e1ndez! The defender beats Krul, who was lured into no man\u2019s land by the corner, to the ball and it is destined to ripple the Norwich goal \u2013 only for Hern\u00e1ndez to intervene on the goalline. Arsenal give Norwich another fright. 9 min: Aubameyang surges down the right but cannot pick out Lacazette in the centre. Chambers collects the seconds and has a shot blocked. Arsenal win a corner. Norwich cannot live with the visitors\u2019 energy ... 7 min: Kolasinac hammers a cross into the front post from the left flank, where he burst to the byline with Aarons for company. Krul goes to ground to collect but Zimmerman brings matters into his own hands and the Norwich defender wellies it clear. Norwich fans are in great voice but, on the pitch, it is all Arsenal. 6 min: Amadou drags a shot wide for Norwich. Meanwhile ... Lys Mousset is at it again. The former Bournemouth striker has given Sheffield United a 1-0 lead at Molineux. Chris Wilder\u2019s side are back up to fifth \u2013 above Tottenham \u2013 in the table as it stands. 5 min: Krul denies Lacazette! Willock makes a brilliant run beyond Lacazette, causing panic in the Norwich box. Willock latches on to Guendouzi\u2019s lofted pass and holds up possession and eventually plays in Lacazette, who fails to make a clean contact with the ball and the Norwich goalkeeper claws it to safety. The resulting corner comes to nothing but it has been a very positive start by Arsenal. 2 min: Lacazette with a sumptuous piece of control 35 yards from goal proves the catalyst for a promising Arsenal move. David Luiz plays the ball forward into the Frenchman, who takes the sting out of the pass before nudging it into \u00d6zil. Arsenal work it wide to Chambers, whose cross from the right flank is blocked by Byram. Norwich clear. 1 min: Arsenal, lining up in a 4-3-3, get the ball to Aubameyang, who scoops a cross into the box. Max Aarons thumps it clear. Lacazette gets things started at Carrow Road. Meanwhile Arsenal women are 8-0 up against Bristol City with less than an hour played. No pressure, Freddie ... The teams trudge out of the tunnel. Here we go ... It\u2019s a beautiful, brisk day at Carrow Road. Less than 10 minutes until kick-off. Will Freddie Ljungberg get off to a flyer? Watford Gap: A gentle reminder Wolves v Sheffield United also gets under way at 2pm (GMT) at Molineux. For Wolves, Max Kilman makes his full Premier League debut, with the 22-year-old replacing the suspended Romain Sa\u00efss. Kilman, who spent 2016-17 on loan at Marlow, joined Wolves from fifth-tier Maidenhead United last year. Chris Wilder has made two changes, with on-loan Manchester United goalkeeper Dean Henderson recalled, while John Egan replaces Phil Jagielka, who misses out because of a head injury. More soundbites from man-of-the-moment Ljungberg: It is a very proud day for me and my family. I represented this club and played for them for 10 years and to have the opportunity to lead them out is a great, great honour As the manager I need to pick the team I believe in. I\u2019ve used a bit of experience and I think they need to take the lead in a hard time like we are in at the moment. There are difficult decisions to be made, for example I left Reiss Nelson back home in London, which is really hard because he is the future of this club, a great talent but I had to leave him out. Those are the decisions you have to do and it\u2019s not always easy. I felt this was a good lineup and hopefully we will be successful Freddie Ljungberg gives the lowdown on his team selection, with Granit Xhaka being given the nod in midfield and Shkodran Mustafi handed his first league start of the season among four changes. Asked if everyone has been given a clean slate following Emery\u2019s exit, an ice-cool Ljungberg replies: \u201cOne hundred per cent. I believe in how people treat me and I give everybody a possibility. I felt that was the balance of our team and I took the decision. For me the captaincy, there has been so many discussions for us I just thought it is better to leave it is as it. Auba is a great captain, a great player and that\u2019s how we are going to go.\u201d Do not fear, we have an answer to the big question. It seems Freddie Ljungberg is not a tracksuit or a suit manager but rather a knitwear kind of guy. Arsenal honcho Josh Kroenke gave Ljungberg a glowing reference, saying the Swede has the club\u2019s DNA at heart. \u201cWe feel he is the right person in the moment to take the club forward,\u201d Kroenke, the Arsenal director, said. \u201cWe started to fall short of several goals that we set. We still feel we can achieve those goals this season. I think footballers are at their best when I see smiles on their faces and going out there and winning matches. That\u2019s a winning formula to me.\u201d Team news news: Granit Xhaka makes his first Premier League start since that infamous departure at home to Crystal Palace in October as interim manager Freddie Ljungberg makes four changes from the XI that rescued a draw against Southampton. Mesut \u00d6zil starts while Lucas Torreira, Kieran Tierney and Sokratis drop to the bench. The full-back H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn is absent with a hamstring injury. Ibrahim Amadou replaces Alex Tettey as Daniel Farke names an otherwise unchanged Norwich side. Norwich City (4-2-3-1): Krul; Aarons, Zimmerman, Godfrey, Byram; Trybull, Amadou; Cantwell, McLean, Hern\u00e1ndez; Pukki Subs: F\u00e4hrmann, Lewis, Vrancic, Srbeny, Buend\u00eda, Stiepermann, Roberts Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Leno; Chambers, Mustafi, David Luiz, Kolasinac; Xhaka, Guendouzi; Willock, \u00d6zil, Aubameyang; Lacazette Subs: Mart\u00ednez, Sokratis, Tierney, Torreira, Pepe, Saka, Martinelli Referee: Paul Tierney The big Arsenal news this week? They ditched the private jet and hopped on to the team bus for this season\u2019s visit to Carrow Road after taking flak for chartering a 14-minute flight from Luton airport to Norfolk four years ago. How times have changed. Not only that but Freddie Ljungberg is now in the hot-seat after Arsenal sent Unai Emery packing with his P45. Ljungberg, who has whet supporters appetite by declaring his love for va-va-voom football will be ably assisted by former defender and Big F ... Per Mertesacker. Fifty-six days have passed since Arsenal\u2019s last win in the Premier League (against Eddie Howe\u2019s Bournemouth at the start of October) and, in terms of performance, surely anything will be an improvement on Thursday\u2019s abject defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt, Emery\u2019s final game in charge. \u201cHowever long I oversee Arsenal for I will give everything I have to put smiles back on faces again,\u201d says Ljungberg, who faces competition from the former Juventus manager Max Allegri for the permanent gig. Norwich, meanwhile, will be keen to build on that away win at Everton last time out. \u201cWe\u2019re not too down after disappointing results and weren\u2019t too high after the Everton win,\u201d says Daniel Farke. \u201cWe remain the underdogs in every game, especially against Arsenal. But we always have a chance.\u201d Kick-off: 2pm (GMT)",

      "bodyText": "The Cosmic Crisp \u2013 a new super-sweet variety of apple that can reportedly last longer than a year in the refrigerator \u2013 is expected to hit grocery stores in the US this week. The Cosmic Crisp\u2019s release comes after two decades of development and some three years of planting apple trees. Washington state farmers have exclusive growing rights for one decade, according to local media outlet KIMA. The apple, developed by Washington State University\u2019s fruit tree breeding program and first cultivated in 1997, purports to have a \u201cremarkably firm and crisp texture\u201d and be \u201csurprisingly sweet, making it an excellent eating apple\u201d, according to its website.

Just over 450,000 40lb boxes of the Cosmic Crisp crop were expected to be shipped to retailers across the US on Sunday, according to the Spokane-based Spokesman-Review.

      "bodyText": "I had grown up with the fairly unshakable conviction that relatives were irretrievably problematic things, and that, in general, they were best avoided. I had good reason to think this way. My grandmother had an awkward relationship with her mother, just as my mother endured a difficult relationship with her. My parents were spectacularly mismatched but stayed married \u2013 against my grandparents\u2019 gloomy predictions \u2013 for a full 10 years before going their separate ways. After they split, my relationship with my younger brother dutifully headed in a similar direction: eternal enmity. We grew stealthily into polar opposites and our adolescent issues didn\u2019t mellow with age. The last we saw of one another was at our mother\u2019s funeral, 20 years ago. Hardly surprising, then, that I never much wanted to start a family myself, convinced that I wasn\u2019t up to it. An absent father does not prime you for becoming an engaged one.

      "bodyText": "Iran has warned it may \u201cseriously reconsider\u201d its commitments to the UN atomic watchdog if European parties to a nuclear deal trigger a dispute mechanism that could lead to fresh sanctions. The speaker for the Iranian parliament, Ali Larijani, told a press conference in Tehran on Sunday: \u201cIf they use the trigger [mechanism], Iran would be forced to seriously reconsider some of its commitments to the International Atomic Energy Agency. If they think doing so is more beneficial to them, they can go ahead.\u201d The threat to trigger sanctions has come after the Iranian government has taken a series of deliberate steps away from the 2015 nuclear deal, which it says are intended as a reprisal for Europe\u2019s failure to deliver on commitments to boost trade. Iran has also been frustrated by Europe\u2019s refusal to defy the threat of US sanctions against any European company that trades with Iran. A mechanism known as Instex developed by Europe to sidestep sanctions received a boost at the weekend when six more EU countries said they would join. Instex is a bartering system devised to avoid the reach of the US, but Iran is less interested in the number of EU countries signed up than the fact that no deals are being made under the mechanism. Israel on Sunday attacked the six new signatories, saying it encouraged Tehran\u2019s repression of protests. \u201cBelgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden could not have picked worse timing,\u201d the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe hundreds of innocent Iranians murdered during the latest round of protests are rolling in their graves.\u201d The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said 161 demonstrators were killed in the protests over petrol price rises, a figure disputed by Iran. Larijani\u2019s warning came as he fuelled speculation he would run for the post of president in the 2021 elections by announcing he would not stand in parliamentary elections in February next year. Larijani was speaking on the day registration for standing in the parliamentary elections opened. All candidates have to be vetted by the Guardian Council, a theological body. A spokesman for the council, Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei, said it may be less likely to debar candidates than before. He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t consider ourselves immune from criticism. We may also accept that mistakes have been made in the past. But for the next legislative elections we are trying to reduce our mistakes and respect the rights of candidates.\u201d",

The group\u2019s latest production, Peter Panties, is touring until March. Time Out has called them \u201clone heterosexual interlopers in the thoroughly gay world of adult panto\u201d \u2013 a description with which Glyn Doggett, the company manager, has no issue.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not doing out-and-out camp,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re touring regionally, so we want something that will appeal to the masses.\u201d The three-strong cast, including Pippa Johnson, take multiple parts. Some of the fun comes from the chaos as they scramble around to fill every role, some from the script\u2019s prurience. \u201cOne of my characters is Wendy, who\u2019s usually very prim and proper,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cBut in our version, she\u2019s absolutely sex mad and is after everyone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c13f40b2175dd48a7a67a0f8a7ac822ecc1ab8ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c13f40b2175dd48a7a67a0f8a7ac822ecc1ab8ee/0_0_3142_4064/773.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s us in control\u2019 \u2026 Peter Panties.\" width=\"773\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s us in control\u2019 \u2026 Peter Panties.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bradfield believes there can be pitfalls for an adult panto that doesn\u2019t identify as LGBT. \u201cIn a non-queer adult one,\u201d he says, \u201cit might be a challenge not to stray into potentially homophobic or misogynistic humour. If the people who are making the crude sexual jokes, as we do, are already marginalised then that isn\u2019t such a risk. It\u2019s the old rule about not punching down.\u201d</p> <p>Jim Davidson\u2019s panto Boobs in the Wood featured comedy Asian accents and a hostile musical number called The Shirt-Lifters\u2019 Song. It\u2019s quite something to mock gayness from within one of the few genres in which it has historically enjoyed impunity. Davidson\u2019s last panto, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/4wbwgb/i-went-to-jim-davidsons-scottish-romp-before-it-got-cancelled-930\">Sinderella 2: Another Scottish Romp</a>, closed mid-run in 2015 when he was accused of bullying theatre staff (which he denied) and sneaking off to the pub mid-performance (which he admitted). </p> <p>Johnson is confident that even as a non-camp \u201cheterosexual\u201d panto, Peter Panties is respectful to all its audience members. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re redoing shows from 10 years ago,\u201d she says, \u201cand there\u2019ll be lines or attitudes that aren\u2019t OK any more, so we change those. But as one of two women on stage, what I like is that it\u2019s usually us in control. I make a complete dick of myself and take the mickey out of the way women are often used as sex objects. I find that I\u2019m more annoyed by the traditional pantos than by anything in the adult ones.

A gay sensibility dominates adult panto but other brands are available, as demonstrated by the Market Theatre Company in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, which has spent more than 20 years producing shows so successful that they outlast panto season. The group\u2019s latest production, Peter Panties, is touring until March. Time Out has called them \u201clone heterosexual interlopers in the thoroughly gay world of adult panto\u201d \u2013 a description with which Glyn Doggett, the company manager, has no issue. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing out-and-out camp,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re touring regionally, so we want something that will appeal to the masses.\u201d The three-strong cast, including Pippa Johnson, take multiple parts. Some of the fun comes from the chaos as they scramble around to fill every role, some from the script\u2019s prurience. \u201cOne of my characters is Wendy, who\u2019s usually very prim and proper,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cBut in our version, she\u2019s absolutely sex mad and is after everyone.\u201d Bradfield believes there can be pitfalls for an adult panto that doesn\u2019t identify as LGBT. \u201cIn a non-queer adult one,\u201d he says, \u201cit might be a challenge not to stray into potentially homophobic or misogynistic humour. If the people who are making the crude sexual jokes, as we do, are already marginalised then that isn\u2019t such a risk. It\u2019s the old rule about not punching down.\u201d Jim Davidson\u2019s panto Boobs in the Wood featured comedy Asian accents and a hostile musical number called The Shirt-Lifters\u2019 Song. It\u2019s quite something to mock gayness from within one of the few genres in which it has historically enjoyed impunity. Davidson\u2019s last panto, Sinderella 2: Another Scottish Romp, closed mid-run in 2015 when he was accused of bullying theatre staff (which he denied) and sneaking off to the pub mid-performance (which he admitted). Johnson is confident that even as a non-camp \u201cheterosexual\u201d panto, Peter Panties is respectful to all its audience members. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re redoing shows from 10 years ago,\u201d she says, \u201cand there\u2019ll be lines or attitudes that aren\u2019t OK any more, so we change those. But as one of two women on stage, what I like is that it\u2019s usually us in control. I make a complete dick of myself and take the mickey out of the way women are often used as sex objects. I find that I\u2019m more annoyed by the traditional pantos than by anything in the adult ones. I mean, why does the woman always have to be rescued by the prince?\u201d Pinocchio: No Strings Attached is at Above the Stag theatre, London, until 11 January. Pride and Prejudice: The Gay Panto is at the White Bear, London, from 19 December to 4 January. Peter Panties is touring until March.",

(It seems to work: he goes largely unnoticed sitting on a bench, and it\u2019s only when the cap comes off for photos that people stop and point and get their phones out.) He has just walked from his houseboat on the Thames. Bear, his wife, Shara, and boys \u2013 Jesse, Huckleberry and Marmaduke \u2013 also have a small island in north Wales and a home in Switzerland. To escape to the mountains, or to escape from HMRC? \u201cNo, it\u2019s certainly not about getting away from British tax. I\u2019m a proud, proud British taxpayer,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Yeah, I\u2019m going in hard. I learned it from his new book. How to Stay Alive: The Ultimate Survival Guide for Any Situation, in the How To Handle Yourself In a Fight chapter. \u201cRemember: you never win a defensive fight. Strike first, strike hard.\u201d And never give up. NEVER.</p> <p>He remains mostly good-humoured, only occasionally sighing at my questions. He also has an alarming habit of asking his own, trying to turn the tables. \u201cLook, you\u2019re as scruffy as me,\u201d he points out. \u201cCan you get away with that in the office? What do your kids say? \u2018Dad, get a grip?\u2019 How old are your kids?\u201d</p> <p>No, Bear. How old are yours? (Answer: 16, 13 and 10, while Bear himself is 45.) This isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about you. And surviving. At which point the rat appears again. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten a lot of rats in my time \u2013 they are not as bad as you might imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the last one was with Prime Minister Modi \u2026 no, the last rat I ate was with David Walliams.\u201d</p> <p>Exactly, I think: he puts his celebrity guests through hell, so he can take a bit back. I\u2019ve learned other things from the book, too, about preparation, not getting sidetracked. I\u2019ve picked my subjects and my questions, and I\u2019m sticking to them. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/18/questiontime.beargrylls\" title=\"\">Grilling Bear</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Rat or squirrel?</strong><br></h2> <p>Actually this wasn\u2019t a prepared question, but a squirrel has just appeared, so I wonder whether the former SAS man would go for this or the rat if he had to live off the land<strong>.</strong> And the answer is: squirrel.

But it could be used in other situations. Bear Grylls encourages criminality: what do you say about that? \u201cYou know what? At this point I say: \u2018Go fuck yourself,\u2019\u201d he says, laughing. Just.</p> <h2><strong>Who are his heroes?</strong></h2> <p>The Scarlet Pimpernel, Robin Hood, George Mallory, Tarzan, John the Baptist \u2026</p> <p>John the Baptist? \u201cI\u2019d say No 1. Never went to church, but loved Christ, lived in the wild, loved locusts and honey, cared about people.\u201d</p> <p>Does God help you survive? \u201cYeah, unashamedly. I see it in relationships, and in my children, I see it in nature, I see it in great things, quiet kindnesses, in little gestures, I see the beauty of God when I see someone who is caring with their grandmother with dementia. Look at the Scouts: there are now 22,000 scouts in this country \u2013 our Dementia Friends \u2013 every week going into senior citizens\u2019 homes holding hands with dementia patients.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Why do the Scouts matter?</strong></p> <p>More passing fauna, not wild: a procession of well-groomed horses ridden by men in dressy uniform. \u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful? Lifeguards \u2013 wonderful. Look at that \u2013 service.\u201d</p> <p>The Scouts are all about service, he says. \u201cIn 1907, Baden-Powell said: \u2018I want to bring people from different backgrounds, I want to give them a common set of values and experiences of adventure and send them out into the world to make a difference in their communities.\u2019 It is now the biggest youth organisation on the planet, 50 million strong, growing faster than ever before.\u201d</p> <p>He is dead proud of being chief scout, tells me I should sign my children up. \u201cBut more importantly, you should volunteer because then it\u2019s something you are doing with your kids.

      "bodyText": "I have been given a time and a place to rendezvous with the world-famous adventurer Bear Grylls. Eleven hundred hours, at the arrow on the map, which turns out to be in the south-east corner of Hyde Park, London, at the huntress fountain. It may not be the Costa Rican rainforest, but the squawking of urban parakeets passing overhead helps. And the goddess Diana shooting her arrow is fitting. Further fauna: a rat scuttles out from under a shrub, in search of lunch. Has it been planted there by Bear, I wonder? Will it be my lunch, boiled in my own urine? Where is he, and how will he arrive? From the air probably, dangling from a rope ladder; I\u2019m listening for the sound of whirling rotor blades. Or perhaps he will jetski across the Serpentine\u2026 Disappointingly, Grylls just strolls over casually, bearing takeaway cappuccinos. If indeed this is Bear Grylls, wearing a baseball cap and sporting a tache. Did he grow it for Movember? Actually, he says, he was just filming in Fiji, stopped shaving and grew \u201ca bit of rough\u201d. But then he had a Royal Marines dinner last week. \u201cI thought, \u2018I can\u2019t turn up in full mess kit with \u2026\u2019 like you,\u201d he says, pointing at my own bit of rough. \u201cSo I shaved the rest of it off and kept the moustache.\u201d The baseball cap is so he can walk around town unbothered. (It seems to work: he goes largely unnoticed sitting on a bench, and it\u2019s only when the cap comes off for photos that people stop and point and get their phones out.) He has just walked from his houseboat on the Thames. Bear, his wife, Shara, and boys \u2013 Jesse, Huckleberry and Marmaduke \u2013 also have a small island in north Wales and a home in Switzerland. To escape to the mountains, or to escape from HMRC? \u201cNo, it\u2019s certainly not about getting away from British tax. I\u2019m a proud, proud British taxpayer,\u201d he says. Yeah, I\u2019m going in hard. I learned it from his new book. How to Stay Alive: The Ultimate Survival Guide for Any Situation, in the How To Handle Yourself In a Fight chapter. \u201cRemember: you never win a defensive fight. Strike first, strike hard.\u201d And never give up. NEVER. He remains mostly good-humoured, only occasionally sighing at my questions. He also has an alarming habit of asking his own, trying to turn the tables. \u201cLook, you\u2019re as scruffy as me,\u201d he points out. \u201cCan you get away with that in the office? What do your kids say? \u2018Dad, get a grip?\u2019 How old are your kids?\u201d No, Bear. How old are yours? (Answer: 16, 13 and 10, while Bear himself is 45.) This isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about you. And surviving. At which point the rat appears again. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten a lot of rats in my time \u2013 they are not as bad as you might imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the last one was with Prime Minister Modi \u2026 no, the last rat I ate was with David Walliams.\u201d Exactly, I think: he puts his celebrity guests through hell, so he can take a bit back. I\u2019ve learned other things from the book, too, about preparation, not getting sidetracked. I\u2019ve picked my subjects and my questions, and I\u2019m sticking to them. Grilling Bear. Rat or squirrel? Actually this wasn\u2019t a prepared question, but a squirrel has just appeared, so I wonder whether the former SAS man would go for this or the rat if he had to live off the land. And the answer is: squirrel. It\u2019s bigger and easier to catch. \u201cYou could literally sit down, be quiet, put some crumbs at your feet, then stand on it. In the wild you\u2019ve got to be a bit more savvy.\u201d Surviving in Hyde Park, in some kind of nightmare post-Brexit Armageddon perhaps, would be a piece of cake, he says. As well as the rats, squirrels, pigeons and ducks, there\u2019s water, and trees to build a shelter with. And if a dog attacked? Formidable hunters (I don\u2019t think he\u2019s talking about that bichon frise over there), he agrees, but he has tips. \u201cDon\u2019t make eye contact \u2013 that\u2019s a threat. Don\u2019t smile, because that\u2019s showing your teeth. Turn sideways to protect your vital organs. Don\u2019t run because they are chase animals\u2026\u201d Suddenly, he\u2019s up off the bench, acting it out, wrapping a coat around his arm to offer the dog because it\u2019s better to be bitten on the arm than the neck. With the other hand he would be looking for something, even if it was just a phone or his bare hands. \u201cBAM! Really aggressive, really hard, straight to the eye socket to blind it, and into the brain,\u201d he says, jabbing at the imaginary canine. In a second he\u2019s gone from good-natured and mild-mannered, if occasionally a little exasperated, to Bear Grylls from the telly, the caricature, the brand, undeniably successful, but faintly ridiculous. Who actually needs it, though? All this survival stuff, who is it for? Knowing how to deal with a dog attack might be useful but I can\u2019t see how lots of it fits in with my life. Will I even remember, next time I\u2019m swimming with sharks and in need of a poo, to grab my faeces as they come out and hurl them towards the horizon? Or how to land a helicopter in an emergency? It\u2019s a loo book, he says, a little bit of information regularly going in. You don\u2019t have to know it all, \u201cbut it is empowering for both men and women to know how to look after themselves in certain situations. Do you know how to deal with a tsunami and understand what to do if you\u2019re in a car during an earthquake? Don\u2019t stop by pylons, pylons fall down: little things like that.\u201d Remember that, next time you\u2019re in an earthquake, in a car: no parking by pylons. Was he born in the wrong time? He should have been a Victorian explorer, no? \u201cNo. The more civilised we get, the greater the wanderlust and adventure spirit inside. You can\u2019t stamp out 100,000 years of DNA survival in two generations.\u201d He tells me about the Hollywood stars on Running Wild who have told him how good and natural it has felt to sit staring into a fire not saying very much. And a big tough rugby player who people think is a man\u2019s man, but who is embarrassed because he doesn\u2019t know how to tie something to his car\u2019s roof rack. Macho can-do masculinity \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s about, isn\u2019t it? \u201cIt\u2019s about can-do life,\u201d he says. And he\u2019s not going to feed me a headline about modern masculinity, he adds. \u201cI\u2019ve done things on The Island with just men and just women; I\u2019ve taken out Hollywood celebrities.

I just think if you want to influence nobody positively, have no criticism in life, do nothing \u2026 If I didn\u2019t want any criticism I wouldn\u2019t ever do anything.\u201d There\u2019s a bit in the book about how to hotwire a car, in a survival situation, obviously. But it could be used in other situations. Bear Grylls encourages criminality: what do you say about that? \u201cYou know what? At this point I say: \u2018Go fuck yourself,\u2019\u201d he says, laughing. Just. Who are his heroes? The Scarlet Pimpernel, Robin Hood, George Mallory, Tarzan, John the Baptist \u2026 John the Baptist? \u201cI\u2019d say No 1. Never went to church, but loved Christ, lived in the wild, loved locusts and honey, cared about people.\u201d Does God help you survive? \u201cYeah, unashamedly. I see it in relationships, and in my children, I see it in nature, I see it in great things, quiet kindnesses, in little gestures, I see the beauty of God when I see someone who is caring with their grandmother with dementia. Look at the Scouts: there are now 22,000 scouts in this country \u2013 our Dementia Friends \u2013 every week going into senior citizens\u2019 homes holding hands with dementia patients.\u201d Why do the Scouts matter? More passing fauna, not wild: a procession of well-groomed horses ridden by men in dressy uniform. \u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful? Lifeguards \u2013 wonderful. Look at that \u2013 service.\u201d The Scouts are all about service, he says. \u201cIn 1907, Baden-Powell said: \u2018I want to bring people from different backgrounds, I want to give them a common set of values and experiences of adventure and send them out into the world to make a difference in their communities.\u2019 It is now the biggest youth organisation on the planet, 50 million strong, growing faster than ever before.\u201d He is dead proud of being chief scout, tells me I should sign my children up. \u201cBut more importantly, you should volunteer because then it\u2019s something you are doing with your kids. You are teaching them how to write, or how to interview someone, how to dress like a tramp, hahaha.\u201d He wears a Scouts wristband on his right hand, along with ones for the Royal Marines and the SAS Regimental Association, and a bracelet given to him by a nice Berber lady in the Sahara. On his left wrist he\u2019s wearing a Bear Grylls Luminox watch, out next year, inscribed Never Give Up. Will he ever give up? \u201cI hope not,\u201d he says, then tells me a story about trying to persuade his 18-year-old nephew to stop smoking. \u201cI said: \u2018Maybe it\u2019s time to ease back on the smokes.\u2019 And he goes: \u2018You\u2019ve always told me, ever since I was a baby, never to give up\u2019. At which point I held my head in my hands and go: \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d There you go, another headline: Bear Grylls encourages children to smoke. \u201cI knew it was a bad idea doing an interview with the Guardian,\u201d he says. I still get a hug. \u2022 How to Stay Alive: The Ultimate Survival Guide for Any Situation by Bear Grylls is published by Corgi (\u00a38.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com",

Without a hint of stage-school affectation, Meehan sings with truth and directness, her moves tightly choreographed by Lucy Cullingford, her focus never less than intense. The young matinee audience can only watch with awe and admiration \u2013 not to mention shrieks when Lister\u2019s loose-limbed witch and her flying monkeys look set to raid the auditorium as they seek to relieve poor Dorothy of her ruby slippers. Brining\u2019s production is all the more effective for its visual flair. It begins in sandy sepia on Simon Higlett\u2019s wide-open set, with colour drained and dimensions squashed. Simon Wainwright\u2019s video projections and Tim Mitchell\u2019s lighting come into their own with a tornado that\u2019s all swirling scratches and flying debris, complete with spinning aerialists. The payoff is a magically amorphous yellow brick road, an Emerald City that is emerald in every respect and a blue gingham dress for Dorothy. Aiding her on her journey, Sam Harrison and Eleanor Sutton give endearing turns as the Tin Man and Scarecrow, with Marcus Ayton making a particularly impressive Lion, ranging across several octaves regardless of his timidity. At Leeds Playhouse, until 25 January.",

      "body": "<p>Not for the first time during this extraordinary election does the world feel like the bottom of the rabbit hole, where Alice, with a \u201cbumped head and bruised soul\u201d, says: \u201cIt would be so nice if something made sense for a change.\u201d</p> <p>In just a fortnight, the Conservative party rebranded its press office Twitter account into a seemingly neutral fact-checking service; edited BBC footage for a Facebook advert in a move that was called a \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d distortion of the broadcaster\u2019s output; and threatened to \u201creview\u201d Channel 4\u2019s broadcasting licence for its \u201cprovocative partisan stunt\u201d replacing the prime minister with an ice sculpture during its climate debate. </p> <p>Then, not long after the sculpture melted, the BBC pulled off its own provocative partisan stunt by giving Boris Johnson a platform to make political capital out of the dead.</p> <p>To add insult to injury, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/dec/01/boris-johnson-on-dodging-andrew-neil-interview-and-london-bridge-attack-video\">inviting Johnson on to the Marr Show to discuss the London Bridge horror</a>, even though he had refused to sit across from Andrew Neil, was \u201cin the public interest\u201d, according to a pompous BBC statement.</p> <p>That interest was hardly served by Johnson filibustering his way out of any answers as though he were a poor contestant on Just A Minute. Marr tried his best but even describing Johnson\u2019s refusal to stop talking over him or answering the questions as \u201cchuntering\u201d, rather than \u201clying\u201d, felt wrong.</p> <p>No journalist likes to refuse an interview but there was a good reason for the BBC to refuse to play into Johnson\u2019s hands.</p> <p>Several cock-ups at the BBC have already prompted an alarming number of online conspiracy theories and staff morale is low among those working on the election. Most notably, the broadcasting of Neil\u2019s grilling of Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 before a deal with Johnson was agreed \u2013 was not only blundering but craven, too.</p> <p>It seems like a good time to ask how this country \u2013 with a public service broadcaster that has long been the envy of the world \u2013 has been brought so low by bullying and gaslighting tactics straight from the Trumpian rulebook. Old games, such as playing off the media by demanding control for access, and snubbing those who don\u2019t play the game, now come with an added frisson of a political tendency to favour online polls and playing to social media, rather than a proper grilling by a journalist.</p> <p>In this environment no amount of old-style BBC excuses, from highlighting individual victories such as Reality Check to the bigger picture (\u201cthere\u2019s so much content mistakes will happen\u201d) helps. The BBC also needs to learn that when you\u2019re on the ropes, it is wise to avoid smacking your own face.</p> <p>Even before this weekend it was a mistake to edit out the laughter that greeted Johnson\u2019s answer in the Question Time election debate and the BBC took too long to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50546115\" title=\"\">admit</a> it. Forced to trot around the campaign trail to avoid being denied fuller access, the BBC should have thought twice before sharing Boris Johnson\u2019s jam-before-cream scone habit. There have been other errors, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1199735028558815232\" title=\"\">foolish retweets</a> and overly<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/18/boris-johnson-lying-media\" title=\"\"> chummy interviews</a>, all of which are seized on by social media.</p> <p>As for the Neil cock-up, one former and still supportive BBC news executive told me he could hardly believe that both interviews had not been put \u201cin the can\u201d ahead of transmission. It is too easy to see the Corbyn interview in which Neil pressed him again and again on antisemitism and spending as a bit of a stitch-up by the BBC, especially as there is now unlikely to be a Johnson version.</p> <p>While #BBCimpartiality started trending on Twitter, the Corbyn-supporting website <a href=\"https://www.thecanary.co/opinion/2019/11/28/we-need-to-talk-about-the-bbc-because-now-its-taking-propaganda-to-the-next-level/\" title=\"\">the Canary</a> said it was \u201ctime to stop paying the licence fee\u201d. BBC insiders call the hardball process being played by the Conservatives \u201cworrying\u201d, \u201cfrustrating\u201d and \u201cdemoralising\u201d. One talked of bullying emails copied to senior executives as well as programme producers from the Tory campaign team. With just two weeks to go, one said the \u201cgovernment has all the cards in their hands\u201d.</p> <p>Outside the circus of politicians, journalists and producers, the effect of all this is corroding public trust. According to<a href=\"https://twitter.com/benatipsosmori/status/1199650005486854144?s=20\" title=\"\"> Ipso</a>, just 26% of those surveyed trust journalists to tell the truth.

      "bodyText": "Not for the first time during this extraordinary election does the world feel like the bottom of the rabbit hole, where Alice, with a \u201cbumped head and bruised soul\u201d, says: \u201cIt would be so nice if something made sense for a change.\u201d In just a fortnight, the Conservative party rebranded its press office Twitter account into a seemingly neutral fact-checking service; edited BBC footage for a Facebook advert in a move that was called a \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d distortion of the broadcaster\u2019s output; and threatened to \u201creview\u201d Channel 4\u2019s broadcasting licence for its \u201cprovocative partisan stunt\u201d replacing the prime minister with an ice sculpture during its climate debate. Then, not long after the sculpture melted, the BBC pulled off its own provocative partisan stunt by giving Boris Johnson a platform to make political capital out of the dead. To add insult to injury, inviting Johnson on to the Marr Show to discuss the London Bridge horror, even though he had refused to sit across from Andrew Neil, was \u201cin the public interest\u201d, according to a pompous BBC statement. That interest was hardly served by Johnson filibustering his way out of any answers as though he were a poor contestant on Just A Minute. Marr tried his best but even describing Johnson\u2019s refusal to stop talking over him or answering the questions as \u201cchuntering\u201d, rather than \u201clying\u201d, felt wrong. No journalist likes to refuse an interview but there was a good reason for the BBC to refuse to play into Johnson\u2019s hands. Several cock-ups at the BBC have already prompted an alarming number of online conspiracy theories and staff morale is low among those working on the election. Most notably, the broadcasting of Neil\u2019s grilling of Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 before a deal with Johnson was agreed \u2013 was not only blundering but craven, too. It seems like a good time to ask how this country \u2013 with a public service broadcaster that has long been the envy of the world \u2013 has been brought so low by bullying and gaslighting tactics straight from the Trumpian rulebook. Old games, such as playing off the media by demanding control for access, and snubbing those who don\u2019t play the game, now come with an added frisson of a political tendency to favour online polls and playing to social media, rather than a proper grilling by a journalist. In this environment no amount of old-style BBC excuses, from highlighting individual victories such as Reality Check to the bigger picture (\u201cthere\u2019s so much content mistakes will happen\u201d) helps. The BBC also needs to learn that when you\u2019re on the ropes, it is wise to avoid smacking your own face. Even before this weekend it was a mistake to edit out the laughter that greeted Johnson\u2019s answer in the Question Time election debate and the BBC took too long to admit it. Forced to trot around the campaign trail to avoid being denied fuller access, the BBC should have thought twice before sharing Boris Johnson\u2019s jam-before-cream scone habit. There have been other errors, foolish retweets and overly chummy interviews, all of which are seized on by social media. As for the Neil cock-up, one former and still supportive BBC news executive told me he could hardly believe that both interviews had not been put \u201cin the can\u201d ahead of transmission. It is too easy to see the Corbyn interview in which Neil pressed him again and again on antisemitism and spending as a bit of a stitch-up by the BBC, especially as there is now unlikely to be a Johnson version. While #BBCimpartiality started trending on Twitter, the Corbyn-supporting website the Canary said it was \u201ctime to stop paying the licence fee\u201d. BBC insiders call the hardball process being played by the Conservatives \u201cworrying\u201d, \u201cfrustrating\u201d and \u201cdemoralising\u201d. One talked of bullying emails copied to senior executives as well as programme producers from the Tory campaign team. With just two weeks to go, one said the \u201cgovernment has all the cards in their hands\u201d. Outside the circus of politicians, journalists and producers, the effect of all this is corroding public trust. According to Ipso, just 26% of those surveyed trust journalists to tell the truth. Mind you, politicians rank even lower at 14%. The BBC also consistently tops the polls for most trusted news source, but, as we know, polls don\u2019t tell the whole story. The numbers paying for its licence fee are falling, largely because of the digital-only young but also because of refuseniks who are less and less minded to trust and respect it. Channel 4 had been on the government\u2019s blacklist long before Thursday night\u2019s extraordinary scenes, when Michael Gove attempted to force his way into a leadership debate and brought his own camera crew to record the incident. A speech by its news chief Dorothy Byrne was well received by all but the government, whose minders have more or less refused the channel access. For evidence of this antagonism, just watch Michael Gove ignore a Channel 4 journalist\u2019s attempt to ask questions and, instead, accuse him of launching a \u201crigorous leftwing case for a particular point of view\u201d. He ended with a chilling appeal to the public: \u201cThey know that\u2019s what you do.\u201d The interview may be used on college courses as the moment the definition of truth lost all meaning. The threat towards the state-owned commercially-funded broadcaster\u2019s licence came as no surprise. An earlier culture secretary, John Whittingdale, argued in the Cameron years that selling off the broadcaster was the best way to secure its financial future, a future now even more uncertain given the difficult advertising market. Is it really such a stretch to see the BBC scared of annoying a possible government keen to make it suffer over the cost of free licence fees for over-75s for a start? Ben de Pear, editor of Channel 4 News, told Tory party chairman James Cleverly via Twitter to \u201cstop behaving like Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cstop playing games\u201d. \u201cDon\u2019t refuse to participate and then threaten our licence, it\u2019s a slippery slope,\u201d he added. Down the slope has already gone the sense that questions from journalists can be the best way to hold the powerful to account. So instead of a grilling from a seasoned broadcaster such as Emily Maitlis, we have a series of questions from the public, as seen in at least two of the BBC\u2019s leader debates. I talked to Whittingdale last week who, as Margaret Thatcher\u2019s political secretary, spent hours preparing her for a grilling by ITV\u2019s \u201cinterrogator-in-chief\u201d Brian Walden. \u201cA succession of questions from the audience is not nearly as tough as someone who is grilling you, like a Walden or a Neil!\u201d he said. Yet the BBC continues to trumpet the success of its Question Time format as though the only way to speak up for the people is to just hand over the mic. Of course, no broadcaster can kidnap a politician and make them speak. There needs to be an understanding that being held to account is part of the job. Walden is now dead, of course, and the understanding has gone with him.",

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia is planning to use its position at the head of the Opec oil cartel to buoy global oil prices before the $25bn stock market debut of its state-owned oil giant. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is due to meet its oil market allies this week to agree the cartel\u2019s oil production policy for 2020. The world\u2019s largest oil-producing countries are expected to maintain a tight rein on their oil output in an effort to keep global prices from tumbling below $65 a barrel. As Opec\u2019s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia is expected to use its position to push other members to tighten their compliance with the group\u2019s agreed oil production limits, while cutting its own output even further than it needs to. The oil-rich kingdom hopes that if it keeps a lid on oil production next year the long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) of Saudi Aramco may fetch a good price on its market debut in the next two weeks. On Sunday, Iraq\u2019s oil minister, Thamer Ghadhban, told reporters in Baghdad that Opec and allies outside the cartel, known as Opec+, would consider cutting supply further by about 400,000 barrels a day to 1.6m. Aramco is expected to announce the initial price of shares for the world\u2019s most profitable company from Riyadh on the same day that Opec talks take place in Vienna. The listing could value the oil giant at between $1.5tn and $1.7tn, and raise around $25bn for the Saudi state when trading begins later this month. The ambition of the IPO has been steadily scaled back since 2016 when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced plans to offer investors the chance to buy up to 5% of the company on Saudi Arabia\u2019s domestic market, the Tadawul, and on a stock exchange in one of the world\u2019s largest financial centres. Aramco now plans to sell 1.5% of the company, mainly to local investors on the Tadawul, in order to achieve the strongest valuation possible for Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic crown jewel after western banks raised doubts over the oil giant\u2019s steep initial valuation target of $2tn. Samba Capital, one of the banks involved in the IPO, said on Friday that almost 90% of the bids from institutional investors had come from Saudi Arabia. The \u201cforeign\u201d investors that made up the balance included banks and asset managers from within the Gulf region. A healthy share price will still depend on strong global oil prices, which threaten to slip next year because of a glut of global oil supply relative to shaky energy demand forecasts. Chris Midgley, the head of analytics at S&amp;P Global Platts, said Saudi Arabia had been strongly lobbying members of Opec and Opec+ to increase compliance. He said the efforts had already pushed Iraq and Nigeria to pull back their production slightly in recent weeks, and Saudi Arabia itself might cut production. The strict stance on oil output may be enough hold prices at $65 a barrel but it is \u201cunlikely that Opec+ will be able or willing to push prices up significantly higher despite Saudi Arabia\u2019s aspirations\u201d, he added. \u201cEventually, Russian producers will push to increase their quota,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is likely to hold back [oil prices] in the lower $60s during 2020.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the billionaires\u2019 new piggy bank. A bank vault in a grade-II listed 120-year-old former mansion next to the Dorchester Hotel on London\u2019s Park Lane will open for business next week. This is no ordinary bank. This one will be slightly more discerning of its customers than the average high street bank branch. \u201cWe won\u2019t deal with millionaires,\u201d says Sean Hoey, managing director of the facility, run by International Bank Vaults (IBV). \u201cWe will be dealing only with billionaires.\u201d Hoey, who was poached by IBV from Harrods where he was in charge of the Knightsbridge department store\u2019s safety deposit boxes, claimed the new site would be \u201cfar more exclusive than Harrods\u201d. It will definitely cost more, and that is a core part of the sales pitch. \u201cWe are the most expensive safety deposit box in London; actually, in the world,\u201d Hoey says. \u201cBut you know the saying, \u2018You get what you pay for,\u2019 and the customers here will be king.\u201d The cheapest safety deposit box, which is just 5cm high, 16cm wide and 49cm deep, costs \u00a3600-a-year-to rent. That compares to \u00a3465 for a box twice the size in Harrods, and \u00a3240 in Metro Bank \u2013 the UK\u2019s largest supplier of safety deposit boxes with 150,000 boxes across 70 branches. The smallest box is still big enough, Hoey says, to store a wide range of jewellery and \u201ca fair few gold bars \u2013 they\u2019re only the size of your mobile phone.\u201d If billionaires have more gold than that there are boxes the size of filing cabinets, and even a whole room for \u00a32.5m a year. \u201cWe have had a few enquiries about it.\u201d IBV, which is owned by South African multimillionaire Ashok Sewnarain, said it was opening the London vault due to spiking demand from the world\u2019s wealthiest people for safety deposit boxes, in fear of a possible reaction against rising inequality. Hoey says the wealthy also fear the possible impact of the climate crisis, and are increasingly storing their wealth in gold bars as banks begin to charge them to store cash deposits. He says the bank vault, which is in Stanhope House \u2013 a gothic-style mansion built in 1899 for soap magnate Robert William Hudson \u2013 will have more of the feel of an \u201cexclusive private members club than a bank\u201d. Sewnarain has bought a Rolls-Royce with the number plate II IBV, which can be booked to ferry customers to and from the vault. IBV\u2019s advert for a chauffeur to drive the Rolls states: \u201cOur clientele is the UHNW [ultra-high net worth]. IBV London requires the experience and professionalism of a well-trained chauffeur to welcome and drive our high-profile/esteemed clientele to their desired destination.\u201d When they arrive at the site, customers will be greeted by two doormen who will guide them through the security which includes fingerprint and iris scans to open doors to the basement vault. Then, \u201cwhite-gloved custodians\u201d will help customers collect their boxes. The vault is protected by steel-lined walls, ceiling and floor to prevent robbers from tunnelling underneath. IBV also has three branches in South Africa, as well as vaults in Zurich and Dubai. Hoey says he has no idea what people store in their boxes, and discretion and privacy is the appeal of holding boxes. But from his experience at Harrods, where he worked for more than 30 years, he says the main items are jewellery, watch collections, gold bars and coins, documents, art works and family photos. \u201cAt Harrods we had women who would come in the afternoon to collect their jewellery, go to the function in the evening \u2026 and then come back in the morning to return a diamond necklace or whatever.\u201d Anyone can apply for a box \u2013 if they have enough money \u2013 but Hoey says all applicants will be vetted to ensure \u201cwe maintain a certain calibre of clients\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t want money-launderers or undesirables, we want to know our customers. Most will be referred to us by private banks, but we will still vet them again.\u201d He says some of the people who had already applied would be rejected because the bank\u2019s committee had doubts about the origins of their funds. Many prospective customers, Hoey says, are rich people from overseas (mostly Russia, China and the Middle East) who maintain a home in London in the summer. \u201cThey want to know that when they go home, all of their valuables are safely stored in central London.\u201d",

It\u2019s a high-wire act if the tactic provokes a backlash from the general public, but until then the party might feel it works to focus attention on \u201ctheir\u201d issues.</p> <h2><strong>Unskew the polls</strong> </h2> <p>This tactic isn\u2019t brilliant at winning over floating voters, but can help keep the activist base motivated and \u2013 possibly also useful \u2013 sceptical of non-partisan experts.</p> <p>The trick here is to argue that pollsters are either deliberately, because they\u2019re \u201cowned by Tories\u201d, or accidentally \u2013 due to some outside factors \u2013 miSsing what\u2019s really going on with British politics.</p> <p>Given the high-profile polling misses in recent elections, this is an easy sell. What replaces the polls tends to be pretty weak science, though; some just tweak the sample based on what they think it should be (which funnily enough always works in favour of their intended outcome), while others point to the \u201cmuch larger sample sizes\u201d of totally meaningless Twitter polls.</p> <p>Anyone tracking these accounts will get very used to seeing a Peter Hitchens quote talking about how polls are used to shape public opinion, rather than track it, despite him having said they\u2019re <a href=\"https://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/opinion-polls/\" title=\"\">vastly misinterpreting the extent of his meaning</a> on that several years ago.</p> <h2><strong>What can we do about it?</strong> </h2> <p>For the activists in this year\u2019s election, these tricks will just become a fact of life, deploying the right one can draw tens or hundreds of thousands of eyeballs in your campaign\u2019s direction, and no party is going to voluntarily tie a hand behind its back less than two weeks from election day.</p> <p>For those actually trying to make up their minds on how to vote, the law and the rules aren\u2019t going to help \u2013 or at least not much. Political advertising isn\u2019t regulated by advertising watchdogs; the only strictly regulated political speech is making false claims about a candidate and that law is rarely enforced.</p> <p>In practice, being watchful for anything too good \u2013 or too annoying \u2013 to be true is key and learning how to see a range of news and views to shape our opinion. In time, we may realise that we need some kind of new system to regulate speech, perhaps some new political settlement to make us all less angry. Just don\u2019t expect to see any sensible steps in that direction in the next 10 days or so.</p>",

One claim, issued long before Labour actually issued its manifesto, was that the party\u2019s manifesto would cost \u201c\u00a31.2tn\u201d, provoking lots of Labour figures, journalists and fact checkers to take the bait, debate and tweet the big number and draw attention to the issue of Labour spending. The party has tried similar tactics with immigration figures and will probably be ready to deploy the trick again. It\u2019s a high-wire act if the tactic provokes a backlash from the general public, but until then the party might feel it works to focus attention on \u201ctheir\u201d issues. Unskew the polls This tactic isn\u2019t brilliant at winning over floating voters, but can help keep the activist base motivated and \u2013 possibly also useful \u2013 sceptical of non-partisan experts. The trick here is to argue that pollsters are either deliberately, because they\u2019re \u201cowned by Tories\u201d, or accidentally \u2013 due to some outside factors \u2013 miSsing what\u2019s really going on with British politics. Given the high-profile polling misses in recent elections, this is an easy sell. What replaces the polls tends to be pretty weak science, though; some just tweak the sample based on what they think it should be (which funnily enough always works in favour of their intended outcome), while others point to the \u201cmuch larger sample sizes\u201d of totally meaningless Twitter polls. Anyone tracking these accounts will get very used to seeing a Peter Hitchens quote talking about how polls are used to shape public opinion, rather than track it, despite him having said they\u2019re vastly misinterpreting the extent of his meaning on that several years ago. What can we do about it? For the activists in this year\u2019s election, these tricks will just become a fact of life, deploying the right one can draw tens or hundreds of thousands of eyeballs in your campaign\u2019s direction, and no party is going to voluntarily tie a hand behind its back less than two weeks from election day. For those actually trying to make up their minds on how to vote, the law and the rules aren\u2019t going to help \u2013 or at least not much. Political advertising isn\u2019t regulated by advertising watchdogs; the only strictly regulated political speech is making false claims about a candidate and that law is rarely enforced. In practice, being watchful for anything too good \u2013 or too annoying \u2013 to be true is key and learning how to see a range of news and views to shape our opinion. In time, we may realise that we need some kind of new system to regulate speech, perhaps some new political settlement to make us all less angry. Just don\u2019t expect to see any sensible steps in that direction in the next 10 days or so.",

Rightwing and Catholic commentators alike imagined hordes of heavily pregnant women at abortion clinics, demanding their fully formed foetuses be evacuated from their uteruses. Just because the law said that they now could.</p> <p>I, unfortunately, know far more than I want to about what utter nonsense this emotive, anti-abortion rhetoric is. On 26 September 2012 I ended the life of my much-wanted daughter, Elodie, at 24 weeks\u2019 gestation. It\u2019s the hardest and most painful thing I\u2019ve ever done. One thing I now know, with certainty, following this traumatic experience, is that no woman would choose to terminate a pregnancy that late on unless she felt there wasn\u2019t any other option. And no doctor would countenance it, whatever the law said.</p> <p>Decriminalising abortion isn\u2019t a policy promise designed just to win votes. It\u2019s a sensible response to representations from many organisations, including the Royal College of Midwives, the <a href=\"https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/news/rcog-backs-decriminalisation-of-abortion/\" title=\"\">Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists</a> and the <a href=\"file:///Users/home/Downloads/Removal-of-criminal-sanctions-for-abortion-BMA-Position-Paper-July-2019%20(1).pdf\" title=\"\">British Medical Association</a>. It would bring the UK into line with more enlightened countries such as <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/abortion-rights-significant-moments-in-canadian-history-1.787212\" title=\"\">Canada</a>. Most importantly, it would mean that consenting, adult women finally had agency over our own bodies. Because abortion should be a health issue, not a criminal one. We wouldn\u2019t force a woman to donate her kidney to her sick child, would we? Yet the law still allows us to force women to carry foetuses to term against their will, to be vessels.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The law still allows us to force women to carry foetuses to term against their will, to be vessels</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many people are unaware that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19856314\" title=\"\">in the UK in 2019</a>, abortion is still, technically, a criminal offence. This is because the Abortion Act 1967 is underpinned by a Victorian law, the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. Rather than replacing the outdated law, the 1967 act merely modified it. Thus, abortion became legal only up until 24 weeks (except for cases where foetuses are severely ill or disabled, or a woman\u2019s life is at risk) and only if two doctors agree to it \u2013 taking consent away from the individual woman and putting it into her doctors\u2019 hands. No other medical procedure requires legal authorisation as well as the patient\u2019s own consent. The penalty for breaking this law? In theory, life imprisonment.</p> <p>In practice, very few women go to prison. But the law does mean that you can\u2019t get abortion pills at your GP\u2019s surgery and are restricted in where you can have a termination. It also causes delay, so women often have to wait several weeks before they can have the abortion they\u2019ve requested, meaning \u2013 in a grim irony contrary to the spirit of the law \u2013 that they are much further along in their pregnancies than anyone would desire.</p> <p>Labour has promised to decriminalise abortion without time limit, while the Lib Dems will retain the 24-week limit. There\u2019s absolutely no evidence that more women will have abortions simply because it will become easier. That\u2019s frankly insulting. In Canada, which legalised abortion in 1988, there has been no increase at all; in fact rates have been decreasing in the past decade.</p> <p>But pro-lifers don\u2019t just want to prevent decriminalisation. They want to further restrict abortions by banning them after 12 weeks\u2019 gestation. This is misguided. Sometimes, knowing that she has time to make a decision means a woman chooses to go ahead with a pregnancy rather than rushing into an abortion before a legal deadline.</p> <p>My termination would have been legal up until birth even under the current law because my daughter had a severe and extremely rare chromosome disorder, which meant she was unlikely to survive to term and that, if she did, she would be born with painful and debilitating disabilities and probably die shortly afterwards. I knew I had to prevent her suffering.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t until I was almost six months\u2019 pregnant, following many invasive tests, that doctors diagnosed her condition. Had the abortion time limit been lower, I could have been forced to make a decision before I knew if she was viable, to play Russian roulette both with her life and mine. I might have ended up terminating a healthy baby based on guesswork in a rush for a deadline. Many women don\u2019t find out what\u2019s wrong until late in their pregnancies. That\u2019s why legalisation without a time limit is essential.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/23/stella-creasy-anti-abortion-groups-launch-fresh-attack-on-pregnant-labour-mp\">Anti-abortion group renews attack on pregnant Labour candidate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Let me tell you the brutal reality of a late termination. I lay on a hospital bed while a sombre doctor passed a needle through my belly into my daughter\u2019s heart, giving her a lethal injection of potassium chloride. Horribly, they call this feticide.

      "bodyText": "There has been a predictably overwrought response to the election manifesto promises of both Labour and the Liberal Democrats to decriminalise abortion. Rightwing and Catholic commentators alike imagined hordes of heavily pregnant women at abortion clinics, demanding their fully formed foetuses be evacuated from their uteruses. Just because the law said that they now could. I, unfortunately, know far more than I want to about what utter nonsense this emotive, anti-abortion rhetoric is. On 26 September 2012 I ended the life of my much-wanted daughter, Elodie, at 24 weeks\u2019 gestation. It\u2019s the hardest and most painful thing I\u2019ve ever done. One thing I now know, with certainty, following this traumatic experience, is that no woman would choose to terminate a pregnancy that late on unless she felt there wasn\u2019t any other option. And no doctor would countenance it, whatever the law said. Decriminalising abortion isn\u2019t a policy promise designed just to win votes. It\u2019s a sensible response to representations from many organisations, including the Royal College of Midwives, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the British Medical Association. It would bring the UK into line with more enlightened countries such as Canada. Most importantly, it would mean that consenting, adult women finally had agency over our own bodies. Because abortion should be a health issue, not a criminal one. We wouldn\u2019t force a woman to donate her kidney to her sick child, would we? Yet the law still allows us to force women to carry foetuses to term against their will, to be vessels. Many people are unaware that in the UK in 2019, abortion is still, technically, a criminal offence. This is because the Abortion Act 1967 is underpinned by a Victorian law, the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. Rather than replacing the outdated law, the 1967 act merely modified it. Thus, abortion became legal only up until 24 weeks (except for cases where foetuses are severely ill or disabled, or a woman\u2019s life is at risk) and only if two doctors agree to it \u2013 taking consent away from the individual woman and putting it into her doctors\u2019 hands. No other medical procedure requires legal authorisation as well as the patient\u2019s own consent. The penalty for breaking this law? In theory, life imprisonment. In practice, very few women go to prison. But the law does mean that you can\u2019t get abortion pills at your GP\u2019s surgery and are restricted in where you can have a termination. It also causes delay, so women often have to wait several weeks before they can have the abortion they\u2019ve requested, meaning \u2013 in a grim irony contrary to the spirit of the law \u2013 that they are much further along in their pregnancies than anyone would desire. Labour has promised to decriminalise abortion without time limit, while the Lib Dems will retain the 24-week limit. There\u2019s absolutely no evidence that more women will have abortions simply because it will become easier. That\u2019s frankly insulting. In Canada, which legalised abortion in 1988, there has been no increase at all; in fact rates have been decreasing in the past decade. But pro-lifers don\u2019t just want to prevent decriminalisation. They want to further restrict abortions by banning them after 12 weeks\u2019 gestation. This is misguided. Sometimes, knowing that she has time to make a decision means a woman chooses to go ahead with a pregnancy rather than rushing into an abortion before a legal deadline. My termination would have been legal up until birth even under the current law because my daughter had a severe and extremely rare chromosome disorder, which meant she was unlikely to survive to term and that, if she did, she would be born with painful and debilitating disabilities and probably die shortly afterwards. I knew I had to prevent her suffering. But it wasn\u2019t until I was almost six months\u2019 pregnant, following many invasive tests, that doctors diagnosed her condition. Had the abortion time limit been lower, I could have been forced to make a decision before I knew if she was viable, to play Russian roulette both with her life and mine. I might have ended up terminating a healthy baby based on guesswork in a rush for a deadline. Many women don\u2019t find out what\u2019s wrong until late in their pregnancies. That\u2019s why legalisation without a time limit is essential. Let me tell you the brutal reality of a late termination. I lay on a hospital bed while a sombre doctor passed a needle through my belly into my daughter\u2019s heart, giving her a lethal injection of potassium chloride. Horribly, they call this feticide. I then carried her around, dead inside me for two days before I was admitted to the hospital maternity unit, induced and, following a traumatic and painful labour, I gave birth. A woman would choose this only because she had no option, not because she\u2019d \u201cchanged her mind\u201d about pregnancy. Neither do doctors like performing late abortions. The statistics say it all: in 2018, 80% of NHS-funded abortions took place at under 10 weeks. Just 289 terminations took place after 24 weeks \u2013 0.1% of the total. Until abortion is fully decriminalised, we are only a slippery slope away from countries such as El Salvador, where women are jailed for having stillbirths and miscarriages.

It wants LGBT people to live in 'safety' and 'dignity'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>David Cameron learned from Tony Blair that the LGBT vote mattered. In 1997, Blair had turned the status quo on its head, championing the end of <a href=\"https://rightsinfo.org/on-the-human-rights-act-1998-and-bringing-rights-home/\" title=\"\">\u201cunjustified discrimination</a> wherever it exists\u201d. Gay rights campaigners knew exactly how to interpret this, and Blair became the darling of the LGBT community. This was in stark contrast to the Tory homophobia of the 1980s and early 90s, which seemed to benefit them electorally at the time but which later had become a vote loser \u2013 particularly their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jul/25/education.politics\" title=\"\">dogged resistance</a> to repealing the infamous section 28. By 2005, Blair\u2019s commitment to protecting LGBT people, most obviously with the introduction of civil partnerships that year, made his party seem modern compared with the jurassic Tory party under Michael Howard. In 2015, Cameron was able to woo the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/23/tories-level-labour-gay-vote\" title=\"\">gay vote</a> having legislated for same-sex marriage, outshining his coalition partners and proving he could be trusted with liberal values. But in 2017 Theresa May found out to her cost that you can\u2019t take the LGBT vote for granted. In her manifesto she spoke warm words but said little of substance. Is it a coincidence <a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/05/30/jeremy-corbyns-labour-has-a-huge-poll-lead-over-theresa-mays-conservatives-among-lgbt-voters/\" title=\"\">she lost</a> Cameron\u2019s majority?</p> <p>Will the LGBT vote decide the 2019 election? The lack of any real substance in the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto in relation to LGBT rights suggests the party has either learned nothing from Cameron\u2019s success and May\u2019s blunder or it is supremely confident of its majority and thinks it has no need to court gay people. The manifesto makes <a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/11/24/uk-conservative-party-manifesto-boris-johnson-2019-general-election-lgbt-rights/\" title=\"\">two references to LGBT</a> people, one to sexual orientation, among a long list of other protected grounds, and no reference to gender identity or trans people.</p> <p>To their credit, along with the other national political parties (except the Brexit party),the Conservatives are committed in their manifesto to inclusive LGBT education at schools. But when it comes to LGBT rights, that is about it. They agree that LGBT people, along with \u201call religious groups\u201d, should be protected from harassment and violence. They also flag up an international conference on global LGBT rights that\u2019s been in the pipeline for years. It\u2019s a UK government commitment, not a Conservative party one. Other than that, there\u2019s nothing.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s manifesto criticises the Conservatives for being \u201cslow to understand the scale of abuse and discrimination LGBT+ people continue to face\u201d. The hollowness of the Conservative manifesto on LGBT issues suggests it has a point. Labour, in contrast, has an LGBT action plan. It wants LGBT people to live in \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cdignity\u201d. It proposes an LGBT ambassador to work on ending LGBT discrimination abroad. It aims to tackle LGBT health issues, making HIV prevention a priority. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/27/nhs-scotland-introduction-hiv-prevention-drug-prep-report\" title=\"\">PrEP</a>, the pill that can stop people becoming infected, will be made freely available. It commits to finding money to support LGBT causes.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats and Greens have similarly comprehensive policies. Both are explicit in relation to LGBT mental health, as well as guaranteeing full spousal equality, and rights for non-binary people. The Greens write beautifully about combating gender discrimination against LBT women. Both make reference to asylum policy.

      "bodyText": "Can the gay vote swing an election? Ask Nicolas Sarkozy. He lost the French presidency to Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in 2012. Having toyed with LGBT equality in the 2007 French presidential election campaign, Sarkozy won a comfortable majority, but by speaking out against equal marriage in 2012, he turned his back on the LGBT vote.He paid the price. There\u2019s a science to how people vote. Approximately 4% of the population will factor in support for LGBT+ rights in deciding who they vote for. Hollande pipped Sarkozy to the post with the tiniest of margins, just over 3%. David Cameron learned from Tony Blair that the LGBT vote mattered. In 1997, Blair had turned the status quo on its head, championing the end of \u201cunjustified discrimination wherever it exists\u201d. Gay rights campaigners knew exactly how to interpret this, and Blair became the darling of the LGBT community. This was in stark contrast to the Tory homophobia of the 1980s and early 90s, which seemed to benefit them electorally at the time but which later had become a vote loser \u2013 particularly their dogged resistance to repealing the infamous section 28. By 2005, Blair\u2019s commitment to protecting LGBT people, most obviously with the introduction of civil partnerships that year, made his party seem modern compared with the jurassic Tory party under Michael Howard. In 2015, Cameron was able to woo the gay vote having legislated for same-sex marriage, outshining his coalition partners and proving he could be trusted with liberal values. But in 2017 Theresa May found out to her cost that you can\u2019t take the LGBT vote for granted. In her manifesto she spoke warm words but said little of substance. Is it a coincidence she lost Cameron\u2019s majority? Will the LGBT vote decide the 2019 election? The lack of any real substance in the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto in relation to LGBT rights suggests the party has either learned nothing from Cameron\u2019s success and May\u2019s blunder or it is supremely confident of its majority and thinks it has no need to court gay people. The manifesto makes two references to LGBT people, one to sexual orientation, among a long list of other protected grounds, and no reference to gender identity or trans people. To their credit, along with the other national political parties (except the Brexit party),the Conservatives are committed in their manifesto to inclusive LGBT education at schools. But when it comes to LGBT rights, that is about it. They agree that LGBT people, along with \u201call religious groups\u201d, should be protected from harassment and violence. They also flag up an international conference on global LGBT rights that\u2019s been in the pipeline for years. It\u2019s a UK government commitment, not a Conservative party one. Other than that, there\u2019s nothing. Labour\u2019s manifesto criticises the Conservatives for being \u201cslow to understand the scale of abuse and discrimination LGBT+ people continue to face\u201d. The hollowness of the Conservative manifesto on LGBT issues suggests it has a point. Labour, in contrast, has an LGBT action plan. It wants LGBT people to live in \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cdignity\u201d. It proposes an LGBT ambassador to work on ending LGBT discrimination abroad. It aims to tackle LGBT health issues, making HIV prevention a priority. PrEP, the pill that can stop people becoming infected, will be made freely available. It commits to finding money to support LGBT causes. The Liberal Democrats and Greens have similarly comprehensive policies. Both are explicit in relation to LGBT mental health, as well as guaranteeing full spousal equality, and rights for non-binary people. The Greens write beautifully about combating gender discrimination against LBT women. Both make reference to asylum policy. It is perhaps not surprising that the Brexit party has no LGBT policies. But the truly shocking policy omission from the Conservative manifesto is any meaningful reference to trans rights, let alone equality. Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens have thoughtful, sensitive and well-thought-through policies. Labour has gone on to clarify its commitment to ending discrimination against trans people. The failure of the Tories to engage expressly with trans rights is setting up a battleground for the future. The message is clear: Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories consider trans issues to be a vote loser. Has Johnson done enough to avoid a Sarkozy-style own goal? He is taking a risk. His manifesto gives LGBT people no reason to vote Conservative. There isn\u2019t even the attempt made by May to present the Tory party as LGBT-friendly. It may be that he\u2019s calculated that his majority, if he\u2019s to get one, will come from persuading Brexit party voters to back him. Self-evidently, LGBT rights are not important to Brexit party-inclined voters, hence their total absence from the Brexit party manifesto. But this is a dicey strategy. Can Johnson\u2019s Conservatives be trusted with LGBT rights? Cameron aside, Conservatives have form on resisting them.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson has sought to blame Labour for the release of Usman Khan, the convicted terrorist who murdered two people on London Bridge on Friday, as the aftermath of the attack became an increasingly politicised election issue.</p> \n<p>In an interview on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, the prime minister said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d that someone such as Khan should have been freed midway through an earlier sentence, and pledged to change the law.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThe reason this killer was out on the streets was because of automatic early release which was brought in by a leftie government.\u201d</p> \n<p>But challenged on the role of cuts to police, probation services and the judicial system under 10 years of Conservative rule, Johnson repeatedly sought to separate himself from this, and present his government as entirely separate.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve only been in office for 120 days,\u201d he said. Asked by Marr about decisions on public spending taken since 2010, Johnson replied: \u201cI\u2019m a new prime minister. We take a different approach.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the interview Johnson repeatedly sought to make political capital over the attack by Khan, who was freed under licence a year ago after being jailed for his part in an al-Qaida-inspired bombing plot. Khan stabbed two people to death before being shot dead by police.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it is ridiculous, I think it is repulsive, that individuals as dangerous as this man should be allowed out after serving only eight years and that\u2019s why we are going to change the law,\u201d Johnson told Marr.</p> \n<p>He blamed the previous Labour government for the decision: \u201cHis release was necessary under the law because of the automatic early release scheme under which he was sentenced, that was the reality, and that was brought in by Labour with the support of Jeremy Corbyn and the rest of the Labour party.\u201d</p> \n<p>The reality of the case <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/01/khan-attack-will-put-sentencing-and-release-of-terrorists-under-scrutiny\">is more complex</a>. Khan was jailed in 2012 under an an indeterminate public protection sentence (IPP), a system scrapped under the coalition the same year. But an appeal in 2013 saw the sentence replaced by one of 16 years, and he was freed after serving just under half.</p> \n<p>Since the attack, Johnson has pledged to end early release for people convicted of terrorism.</p> \n<p>The father of the first of Khan\u2019s victims to be named, Jack Merritt, who worked to help rehabilitate prisoners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/01/london-bridge-attack-victim-jack-merritt-tributes\">has said that his son</a> \u201cwould not wish his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people unnecessarily\u201d.</p> \n<p>Johnson told Marr there were \u201cprobably about 74\u201d convicted terrorists who had now been freed, saying these would be \u201cproperly invigilated to make sure there is no threat\u201d.</p> \n<p>Speaking earlier on Sky News, Jeremy Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/01/jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-focus-on-rehabilitation-of-terrorists-in-prison\">argued that a better approach</a> would be to focus more on prison services, and the parole and rehabilitation help prisoners receive when they leave.</p> \n<p>Asked by Marr whether he should apologise for cuts to probation services, Johnson said: \u201cObviously, I think we should be investing more in the criminal justice system.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked why the Conservatives had not done this during their time in office, Johnson said his government was \u201cnew in our approach, and it\u2019s new in the way we will tackle issues of public services\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4253cfcbc6942b7ff80053c0f498be7ccd447f69\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4253cfcbc6942b7ff80053c0f498be7ccd447f69/0_283_1099_659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Usman Khan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Usman Khan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC News/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Questioned about the closure of nearly 300 magistrates and crown courts since 2010, he replied: \u201cWe of course understand, now is the time to make investments not just in the NHS, not just in policing, not just in education, but in our criminal justice system.\u201d</p> \n<p>During an often combative interview, which saw Marr repeatedly interrupt the prime minister to ask him to address the question asked, Johnson gave ground on several issues, accepting that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/29/from-40-hospitals-to-six-tories-nhs-numbers-dont-add-up\">40 promised new hospitals</a> were not as yet fully funded.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/01/johnson-spots-an-opportunity-over-state-aid-and-it-may-work\">Johnson spots an opportunity over state aid \u2013 and it may work</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cOf course not, but you don\u2019t commit seed money unless you have a convincing case and a rationale for building that hospital, and you\u2019re determined to go on and do it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Johnson also conceded that though he had entered No 10 promising to tackle the social care crisis, the Conservative manifesto contained few details of how this would be done. \u201cI accept that the full plan needs to be developed,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The BBC initially resisted Johnson appearing on Marr, as it is still seeking to get the prime minister to agree to a half-hour evening interview with Andrew Neil, as all the other main party leaders have done. The corporation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/30/bbc-allows-boris-johnson-interview-on-andrew-marr-show\">changed its mind on Saturday</a>, saying the London Bridge attack made the immediate interview necessary.</p> \n<p>Johnson declined to say whether he would agree to the interview by Neil, an encounter politicians have often found challenging.</p> \n<p>Johnson said he was \u201cperfectly happy to be interviewed by any interviewer called Andrew from the BBC\u201d, but said he had taken part in many interviews in the campaign.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has sought to blame Labour for the release of Usman Khan, the convicted terrorist who murdered two people on London Bridge on Friday, as the aftermath of the attack became an increasingly politicised election issue. In an interview on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, the prime minister said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d that someone such as Khan should have been freed midway through an earlier sentence, and pledged to change the law. He said: \u201cThe reason this killer was out on the streets was because of automatic early release which was brought in by a leftie government.\u201d But challenged on the role of cuts to police, probation services and the judicial system under 10 years of Conservative rule, Johnson repeatedly sought to separate himself from this, and present his government as entirely separate. \u201cI\u2019ve only been in office for 120 days,\u201d he said. Asked by Marr about decisions on public spending taken since 2010, Johnson replied: \u201cI\u2019m a new prime minister. We take a different approach.\u201d In the interview Johnson repeatedly sought to make political capital over the attack by Khan, who was freed under licence a year ago after being jailed for his part in an al-Qaida-inspired bombing plot. Khan stabbed two people to death before being shot dead by police. \u201cI think it is ridiculous, I think it is repulsive, that individuals as dangerous as this man should be allowed out after serving only eight years and that\u2019s why we are going to change the law,\u201d Johnson told Marr. He blamed the previous Labour government for the decision: \u201cHis release was necessary under the law because of the automatic early release scheme under which he was sentenced, that was the reality, and that was brought in by Labour with the support of Jeremy Corbyn and the rest of the Labour party.\u201d The reality of the case is more complex. Khan was jailed in 2012 under an an indeterminate public protection sentence (IPP), a system scrapped under the coalition the same year. But an appeal in 2013 saw the sentence replaced by one of 16 years, and he was freed after serving just under half. Since the attack, Johnson has pledged to end early release for people convicted of terrorism. The father of the first of Khan\u2019s victims to be named, Jack Merritt, who worked to help rehabilitate prisoners, has said that his son \u201cwould not wish his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people unnecessarily\u201d. Johnson told Marr there were \u201cprobably about 74\u201d convicted terrorists who had now been freed, saying these would be \u201cproperly invigilated to make sure there is no threat\u201d. Speaking earlier on Sky News, Jeremy Corbyn argued that a better approach would be to focus more on prison services, and the parole and rehabilitation help prisoners receive when they leave. Asked by Marr whether he should apologise for cuts to probation services, Johnson said: \u201cObviously, I think we should be investing more in the criminal justice system.\u201d Asked why the Conservatives had not done this during their time in office, Johnson said his government was \u201cnew in our approach, and it\u2019s new in the way we will tackle issues of public services\u201d. Questioned about the closure of nearly 300 magistrates and crown courts since 2010, he replied: \u201cWe of course understand, now is the time to make investments not just in the NHS, not just in policing, not just in education, but in our criminal justice system.\u201d During an often combative interview, which saw Marr repeatedly interrupt the prime minister to ask him to address the question asked, Johnson gave ground on several issues, accepting that 40 promised new hospitals were not as yet fully funded. \u201cOf course not, but you don\u2019t commit seed money unless you have a convincing case and a rationale for building that hospital, and you\u2019re determined to go on and do it,\u201d he said. Johnson also conceded that though he had entered No 10 promising to tackle the social care crisis, the Conservative manifesto contained few details of how this would be done. \u201cI accept that the full plan needs to be developed,\u201d he said. The BBC initially resisted Johnson appearing on Marr, as it is still seeking to get the prime minister to agree to a half-hour evening interview with Andrew Neil, as all the other main party leaders have done. The corporation changed its mind on Saturday, saying the London Bridge attack made the immediate interview necessary. Johnson declined to say whether he would agree to the interview by Neil, an encounter politicians have often found challenging. Johnson said he was \u201cperfectly happy to be interviewed by any interviewer called Andrew from the BBC\u201d, but said he had taken part in many interviews in the campaign.",

      "body": "<p>One morning almost five years ago, I awoke from uneasy dreams and, like Gregor Samsa in Franz Kafka\u2019s story, <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, found myself to be\u2026 well, not precisely an insect, but the effect was similar. Trying to get out of bed, I realised I could barely move. So excruciating was the pain in my back, my only option seemed to be to roll myself \u2013 thunk! \u2013 on to the floor.</p> <p>Lying there on my stomach for a few moments, I took in the view (beneath the bed were old shoes and dust balls the size of planets) and then, screwing up my courage, I crawled on to the landing \u2013 which is where I stayed for the rest of the day, sobbing quietly and wondering how I would get to the loo; when, exactly, the NHS emergency doctor would arrive.</p> <p>In the event, it took two shots of morphine \u2013 one in each arm \u2013 to get me upright again. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d I asked the doctor. He shook his head. \u201cNo idea,\u201d he said. \u201cBut your back is in spasm.\u201d He then disappeared into the night, and I went back to bed thinking that everything would surely be fine in the morning.</p> <p>Obviously, it wasn\u2019t. The next three days were hell. Though I took the naproxen he\u2019d prescribed, it made no difference at all to the pain (it also made me feel sick). I begged my GP for diazepam \u2013 the only thing, according to the back-pain sufferers of Twitter, that would really help \u2013 and was duly given all of seven tablets (so addictive, you see). In order to walk, I had to use my late father\u2019s thumb stick, which made me look, bent over as I was, like an etching of death by D\u00fcrer. My mood grew dark. Sometimes, I would bang this stick against the floor and shout, in a silly voice that I fancied to be Chaucerian: \u201cOh, Earth! Let me in!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trying to get out of bed, I found that I could barely move</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the fourth day, I went to the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in Southwark to see Mark Rylance in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/23/farinelli-and-the-king-review-mark-rylance\" title=\"\">Farinelli and the King</a></em> \u2013 an occasion I\u2019d been looking forward to for weeks and wasn\u2019t going to miss even if I did feel as though I had an arrow in my spine. I survived the theatre\u2019s hard, narrow wooden benches only because I took rather more painkillers and diazepam than is strictly recommended. Afterwards, I walked \u2013 I use the term loosely in this instance \u2013 over the Millennium Bridge, hoping to hail a taxi on the other side of the river. This took 20 minutes, as opposed to the usual three; somewhere in the middle, I stopped and gazed at the dome of St Paul\u2019s and prayed \u2013 yes, prayed (I am not a believer) \u2013 that I would make it across. The driver of the taxi I eventually flagged down didn\u2019t try to hide his shock at how long it took me to get to where he\u2019d pulled in. \u201cYou\u2019re like an old woman!\u201d he said, laughing as if this was a huge joke. \u201cCome on, grandma!\u201d I did not tip him.</p> <p>I booked myself an appointment with a physiotherapist, who rolled me around a bit on his consulting table, and clicked my neck. \u201cIt\u2019s your facet joints, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably ease off soon.\u201d <em>Probably</em>?

So many times I almost gave up. Even now, I\u2019m still not quite sure why I didn\u2019t. Fear, I suppose. What if Pilates <em>had</em> cured me?

Hence the decision to steal a few of Labour\u2019s clothes: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/30/conservatives-pledge-raise-national-living-wage-by-2024\">higher minimum wage</a>; extra money for the NHS; modest increases in infrastructure spending.</p> <p>None of which was necessarily inconsistent with the idea that the Singapore-on-Thames model would emerge from the shadows once the UK had actually left the EU. The state aid and procurement commitments are different: they suggest a willingness to intervene that is at odds with leaving the economy to the tender mercies of the free market.</p> <p>As Corbyn knows full well, since he used to make precisely these points in the days when he was on the backbenches railing against the EU\u2019s neoliberal tendencies, and even since the referendum. The Labour leader accepts the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/29/corbyn-reignites-labour-debate-over-eu-rules-on-state-aid-and-socialist-manifesto\">case for more generous state aid</a> and a change to procurement policy but would struggle to offer them under the sort of deal he would negotiate with the EU if he became prime minister.</p> <p>With an election less than two weeks away, it is possible that the Conservative pledges are just for show, and that they have no real intention of putting in place state aid or procurement rules that would antagonise Brussels. There is already justifiable scepticism about whether the UK can agree <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/12/can-uk-get-brexit-super-canada-plus-trade-deal-with-eu-by-end-of-2020\">a free-trade deal</a> with the EU during 2020: a more protectionist state aid and procurement regime would complicate matters.</p> <p>If Johnson is serious, he would be challenging economic orthodoxy, which says that state aid and preferential procurement policies feather-bed inefficient companies, stifle competition and lead to higher prices for consumers. In the UK\u2019s case, the IEA or the ASI would say eschewing protectionism has allowed the economy to specialise in things it does best \u2013 financial and business services \u2013 rather than things it does less well \u2013 manufacturing. Better to have tech startups in London\u2019s Shoreditch than prop up companies that can\u2019t hack global competition.</p> <p>All of which sounds fine. It assumes, though, all state intervention in the economy, any sort of industrial policy, distorts the market and is therefore a bad thing.</p> <p>But historically, as the economist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/jun/24/globalisation\">Ha-Joon Chang</a> has said, all countries have used protectionism as a means of building up their industrial strength, with Britain the first.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The experience of east Asia shows that it is a fallacy to assume that state aid is only about providing support for lame ducks: Japan and South Korea are examples of countries that identified sectors where they wanted to be competitive and used financial support and trade policy to give them infant-industry support.</p> <p>Nor is it the case that there has been no state aid for the financial sector, just that it has been delivered in a less overt way. The Docklands Light Railway and the Jubilee line extension that link Canary Wharf to central London are either infrastructure projects or state aid, depending on your point of view.</p> <p>The final point is this. It is now almost 40 years since the heart was ripped out of Britain\u2019s industrial regions, 40 years of waiting for the free market to deliver its promised renaissance. Instead, the well-paid secure jobs in manufacturing have been replaced by low-paid jobs in call centres and warehouses.</p> <p>So, yes, Johnson may simply be playing politics. It would not be the first time he has been guilty of opportunism. But his argument that the status quo has not worked in Labour\u2019s heartlands is correct. Which is why it may strike a chord.</p>",

Instead, the calculation has been that the swing voters in marginal seats are, when it comes to the economy, to the left of where the Conservative party was under David Cameron and George Osborne but not as far left as the Labour party is under Corbyn. Hence the decision to steal a few of Labour\u2019s clothes: a higher minimum wage; extra money for the NHS; modest increases in infrastructure spending. None of which was necessarily inconsistent with the idea that the Singapore-on-Thames model would emerge from the shadows once the UK had actually left the EU. The state aid and procurement commitments are different: they suggest a willingness to intervene that is at odds with leaving the economy to the tender mercies of the free market. As Corbyn knows full well, since he used to make precisely these points in the days when he was on the backbenches railing against the EU\u2019s neoliberal tendencies, and even since the referendum. The Labour leader accepts the case for more generous state aid and a change to procurement policy but would struggle to offer them under the sort of deal he would negotiate with the EU if he became prime minister. With an election less than two weeks away, it is possible that the Conservative pledges are just for show, and that they have no real intention of putting in place state aid or procurement rules that would antagonise Brussels. There is already justifiable scepticism about whether the UK can agree a free-trade deal with the EU during 2020: a more protectionist state aid and procurement regime would complicate matters. If Johnson is serious, he would be challenging economic orthodoxy, which says that state aid and preferential procurement policies feather-bed inefficient companies, stifle competition and lead to higher prices for consumers. In the UK\u2019s case, the IEA or the ASI would say eschewing protectionism has allowed the economy to specialise in things it does best \u2013 financial and business services \u2013 rather than things it does less well \u2013 manufacturing. Better to have tech startups in London\u2019s Shoreditch than prop up companies that can\u2019t hack global competition. All of which sounds fine. It assumes, though, all state intervention in the economy, any sort of industrial policy, distorts the market and is therefore a bad thing. But historically, as the economist Ha-Joon Chang has said, all countries have used protectionism as a means of building up their industrial strength, with Britain the first. The experience of east Asia shows that it is a fallacy to assume that state aid is only about providing support for lame ducks: Japan and South Korea are examples of countries that identified sectors where they wanted to be competitive and used financial support and trade policy to give them infant-industry support. Nor is it the case that there has been no state aid for the financial sector, just that it has been delivered in a less overt way. The Docklands Light Railway and the Jubilee line extension that link Canary Wharf to central London are either infrastructure projects or state aid, depending on your point of view. The final point is this. It is now almost 40 years since the heart was ripped out of Britain\u2019s industrial regions, 40 years of waiting for the free market to deliver its promised renaissance. Instead, the well-paid secure jobs in manufacturing have been replaced by low-paid jobs in call centres and warehouses. So, yes, Johnson may simply be playing politics. It would not be the first time he has been guilty of opportunism. But his argument that the status quo has not worked in Labour\u2019s heartlands is correct. Which is why it may strike a chord.",

The LHC is huge, around 7km in diameter and 27km in circumference. You cross the French border several times if you go around the ring.</p> <p>The most exciting time to be here, says Dr Fitzpatrick, was 4 July 2012 when they shared the news that they had observed a new particle \u201cconsistent with the Higgs boson\u201d, otherwise known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-cern-scientists-discover\" title=\"\">God particle</a>\u201d. \u201cThe atmosphere was incredible,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThere were queues outside the auditorium; people had heard the rumour and they were sleeping in queues to get in.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Fitzpatrick\u2019s natural passion for his subject is infectious \u2013 at some points I think I even understand what he\u2019s talking about. At first it sounds simple enough and I wonder how I could possibly have failed my physics O-level. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in the area before the Big Bang, when energy was high and that energy allows us to form fundamental particles.

For every matter particle there has to be an antimatter particle. During the Big Bang, antimatter was produced but what happened to it? Did it disappear over time?\u201d</p> <p>The more you learn, the more weirdly wonderful it is. There\u2019s an artistic element to it, too. Fitzpatrick shows us something called the wire chamber: golden and gleaming with layers of tungsten wires, it looks like a measuring instrument straight out of <em>His Dark Materials</em>. \u201cResident artists record what they see here because some of the designs are so beautiful,\u201d he says. People were in tears, he says, when it was taken out of use.</p> <p>It\u2019s time for lunch, and we sit in Cern canteen with Dr Fitzpatrick and his wife, who between them have matter covered. He specialises in antimatter and she is an assistant professor in dark matter. So what\u2019s the difference between the two? Patiently they explain. Antimatter is produced by lightning and cosmic rays, and is predicted by standard particle physics theories. Dark matter cannot be seen using light, which is why no one has found it yet. \u201cAh, I see,\u201d I say. Afterwards I feel quite pleased with myself, but my son is mortified, telling me this is easily the most embarrassing question I could ask a particle physicist. At least I tried, I tell him.</p> <p><em><strong>C</strong></em><em><strong>ern is easy to visit. </strong></em>It\u2019s 20 minutes by bus from Geneva train station, which is a three-minute walk from where we\u2019re staying. <a href=\"https://www.9-hotel-geneve-paquis.ch/en/\" title=\"\">9 Hotel P\u00e2quis</a> is a great value design hotel with a bijou pool.

We take a river boat on Lake Geneva and spot, in the hills, Villa Diodati, where Mary Shelley, Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley famously spent three rainy summer days in 1816, creating stories to tell each other \u2013 one of which became <em>Frankenstein</em>. She points out one of the hotels on the waterfront, where Dostoevsky stayed, gambling so heavily he had to sell his wife\u2019s wedding ring.</p> <p>But we\u2019re not here for literary anecdotes; my son is restless for more physics. So we head for Bern and the Einstein trail \u2013 a two-hour train trip from Geneva. Bern is a fairytale city, one of the smallest capitals in Europe, with medieval spires and cobbled streets. Threading through it like a green ribbon is the star of the city, the river Aare, where people swim, paddleboard and kayak in its opal waters.</p> <p>Einstein moved to Bern in 1903 for two years, living with his wife Mileva Mari\u0107 and son Hans Einstein. In a modest apartment on the third floor of a narrow house, he developed the theory of relativity. Einstein was certainly in the right place to contemplate the nature of time. From his sitting room window he would have heard the Zytglogge clock tower striking the hour. Built in the early 13th century, the clockwork mechanism was the pride of Bern and one of the most advanced in Europe. It still has to be wound by hand each day.</p> <p>A 20-minute walk across the city from his apartment is the <a href=\"https://www.bern.com/en/detail/einstein-museum\" title=\"\">Einstein </a><a href=\"https://www.bern.com/en/detail/einstein-museum\" title=\"\">Museum</a>.

      "bodyText": "There is something retro and subterranean about the maze of narrow corridors ahead of us. Exposed steel pipes run along the ceilings, the floors are shiny linoleum and the doors are moulded wood. It looks as if it has barely changed since it was built back in the 1950s. Welcome to the European Organization for Nuclear Research, better known as Cern, home to the largest particle physics laboratory in the world. Beyond the design, what is more retro, liable to make you misty-eyed for a bygone era, is how it all came into being. In a burst of idealism after the war, scientists petitioned the UN to open a research centre where countries, including Britain, could work together in a spirit of peace, harmony and progress, collaborating and sharing data on how the universe is made. \u201cScience isn\u2019t interested in religion or borders,\u201d says our guide for the morning, particle physicist Dr Conor Fitzpatrick. \u201cYou\u2019ll see Palestinian physicists working alongside Israeli ones.\u201d Dr Fitzpatrick pauses for a moment and points to a small, unassuming plaque hanging on the wall that reads: \u201cWhere the web was born.\u201d Here in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee came up with the idea as a means of sharing information with scientists in different universities and institutes.\u201d Cern, near Geneva, is the holy grail for physicists. There isn\u2019t really anywhere else quite like it, which is why I\u2019m here with my son, an A-level physics student, who is thrilled as we walk through the corridors of the theoretical physics department. He nudges me to look into some of the small offices either side of us, as if we are on a physicists safari. There they are, theoretical physicists in their natural habitat, sitting at desks deep in contemplation or scrawling indecipherable formulae on whiteboards, trying to figure out where all the dark matter is hiding. The pinnacle of any visit here is, of course, to find out more about the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which, as Dr Fitzpatrick explains simply, is two hollow pipes that contain two beams of protons, insulated like a giant thermal flask. The LHC is huge, around 7km in diameter and 27km in circumference. You cross the French border several times if you go around the ring. The most exciting time to be here, says Dr Fitzpatrick, was 4 July 2012 when they shared the news that they had observed a new particle \u201cconsistent with the Higgs boson\u201d, otherwise known as the \u201cGod particle\u201d. \u201cThe atmosphere was incredible,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThere were queues outside the auditorium; people had heard the rumour and they were sleeping in queues to get in.\u201d Dr Fitzpatrick\u2019s natural passion for his subject is infectious \u2013 at some points I think I even understand what he\u2019s talking about. At first it sounds simple enough and I wonder how I could possibly have failed my physics O-level. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in the area before the Big Bang, when energy was high and that energy allows us to form fundamental particles. As we collide particles, it allows us to create ones that didn\u2019t exist at this time \u2013 13.8bn years back when energy was last this high.\u201d Uh-huh, I see. \u201cEverything we see and touch is matter. For every matter particle there has to be an antimatter particle. During the Big Bang, antimatter was produced but what happened to it? Did it disappear over time?\u201d The more you learn, the more weirdly wonderful it is. There\u2019s an artistic element to it, too. Fitzpatrick shows us something called the wire chamber: golden and gleaming with layers of tungsten wires, it looks like a measuring instrument straight out of His Dark Materials. \u201cResident artists record what they see here because some of the designs are so beautiful,\u201d he says. People were in tears, he says, when it was taken out of use. It\u2019s time for lunch, and we sit in Cern canteen with Dr Fitzpatrick and his wife, who between them have matter covered. He specialises in antimatter and she is an assistant professor in dark matter. So what\u2019s the difference between the two? Patiently they explain. Antimatter is produced by lightning and cosmic rays, and is predicted by standard particle physics theories. Dark matter cannot be seen using light, which is why no one has found it yet. \u201cAh, I see,\u201d I say. Afterwards I feel quite pleased with myself, but my son is mortified, telling me this is easily the most embarrassing question I could ask a particle physicist. At least I tried, I tell him. Cern is easy to visit. It\u2019s 20 minutes by bus from Geneva train station, which is a three-minute walk from where we\u2019re staying. 9 Hotel P\u00e2quis is a great value design hotel with a bijou pool. We\u2019re in an area that is more lively and interesting than the Geneva I had expected. Instead of wall-to-wall banks and designer watch shops, the streets are lined with caf\u00e9s and bars. We enjoy a delicious Lebanese kebab and mezze after midnight on crowded tables spilling out on to the pavement. When I meet my walking guide the next morning, she isn\u2019t overly impressed. \u201cYou do realise you\u2019re in the middle of the red light district?\u201d she says, and leads us briskly through the narrow streets towards the Geneva I imagined: remote, elegant and icily exclusive, with sweeping boulevards and grand fin-de-si\u00e8cle hotels overlooking the lake. We take a river boat on Lake Geneva and spot, in the hills, Villa Diodati, where Mary Shelley, Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley famously spent three rainy summer days in 1816, creating stories to tell each other \u2013 one of which became Frankenstein. She points out one of the hotels on the waterfront, where Dostoevsky stayed, gambling so heavily he had to sell his wife\u2019s wedding ring. But we\u2019re not here for literary anecdotes; my son is restless for more physics. So we head for Bern and the Einstein trail \u2013 a two-hour train trip from Geneva. Bern is a fairytale city, one of the smallest capitals in Europe, with medieval spires and cobbled streets. Threading through it like a green ribbon is the star of the city, the river Aare, where people swim, paddleboard and kayak in its opal waters. Einstein moved to Bern in 1903 for two years, living with his wife Mileva Mari\u0107 and son Hans Einstein. In a modest apartment on the third floor of a narrow house, he developed the theory of relativity. Einstein was certainly in the right place to contemplate the nature of time. From his sitting room window he would have heard the Zytglogge clock tower striking the hour. Built in the early 13th century, the clockwork mechanism was the pride of Bern and one of the most advanced in Europe. It still has to be wound by hand each day. A 20-minute walk across the city from his apartment is the Einstein Museum. Small but informative, it features pages of his febrile scrawl, formulae and equations. There is more about the man himself, too, his interests and passions: social justice, civil rights, pacifism and\u2026 falling in love. Those he loved, along with his two wives, included, apparently, a physicist, a spy, a librarian and \u201cperhaps\u201d a nightclub dancer. We wander back along the river to our hotel, Hotel Allegro, which has lovely views across the old town. My son stays put and I\u2019m sent on an errand, a trip to McDonald\u2019s instead of a pricy supper \u2013 barely a saving at 20 Swiss Francs (\u00a316), and that\u2019s only for him. The next evening is more opulent: mushroom soup and rosti in the candlelit baroque splendour of Kornhauskeller, an old wine cellar with frescoed vaulted ceilings. Early the next morning, we take a tour of the clock tower, climbing the steep medieval stairs for an impressive view across the ancient tiled roofs of the city, then a look at the clock mechanism itself. An intricate structure of cogs and wheels, it is powered by a pendulum that has marked each second for the past 800 years, the perfect point to end our adventure in time.

      "body": "<p>I entered through a discreet door in Whitehall, that of the Cabinet Office, and passed down a long sequence of spaces \u2013 literally, corridors of power \u2013 that run parallel to Downing Street, a few metres to the left. I continued to the point where another door or two would, were I so authorised, have got me into No 10. I was admitted to the office of Peter Mandelson, minister without portfolio, at this time in 1998 the second most powerful man in government, sometimes called the Prince of Darkness.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what to expect. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanglancey\" title=\"\">Jonathan Glancey</a>, then architecture and design editor of the <em>Guardian</em>, had been yelled at and threatened by a government press officer for his attacks on the Millennium Dome. I had written a front-page story for the <em>Evening Standard</em>, whose message \u2013 \u201cNew threats to the dome\u201d \u2013 had graced newsstands all over London. It turned out I was getting the \u201cgood cop\u201d. Mandy (as he was also tagged), reclining informally on one of the leather couches in his office, told me how terribly disappointed he was in my criticisms, as he particularly admired my writing.</p> <p>He complimented me on my shirt. We discussed its designer, Paul Smith, and the shop he had just opened in Notting Hill. He asked artful questions that seemed designed to extract the identity of my sources. And that was about it. But it was an unusually high degree of interest, in matters of architecture and design, for a minister in Mandelson\u2019s position to take. This was because the dome was to be the ultimate symbol of the triumph of New Labour. \u201cIf we can\u2019t make this work,\u201d the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, had said, \u201cwe\u2019re not much of a government.\u201d It was to be, said Tony Blair, \u201cBritain\u2019s opportunity to greet the world with a celebration that is so bold, so beautiful, so inspiring that it embodies at once the spirit of confidence and adventure in Britain and the spirit of the future in the world.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s strange, now, to contemplate the passions it aroused. For millions of event-goers the structure is now the O2, where Harry Styles and Diana Ross are among the forthcoming attractions. The Millennium Experience that it contained then is dimly remembered, like a TV soap opera that didn\u2019t catch on. It was eclipsed, as Blairite catastrophes go, by the invasion of Iraq three years later. In 2012 the London Olympics, many times more expensive but nonetheless perceived as a success, put the bad dream of the dome behind it.</p> <p>For a bad dream it was. Advance publicity had been both negative and positive. It will be a monumental cock-up, had been one narrative; the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> columnist Boris Johnson had said he would eat his hat if it wasn\u2019t a triumph. Then the opening night happened, 31 December 1999, which must go down as one of the greatest PR disasters in history. Thousands of VIPs, invited to celebrate this night of nights, this once-in-a-lifetime event, among them newspaper editors and the CEOs and chairs of sponsoring corporations, were made to queue for an hour or more for security checks, in the winter cold, at the tube station in Stratford, east London, from where they were to take the train to the dome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bda7b16715e254cb59baa05383ac8c038d54a6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bda7b16715e254cb59baa05383ac8c038d54a6d/0_0_1536_1137/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(L-r) Chairman Bob Ayling, culture secretary Chris Smith and Peter Mandelson inspect a model of the dome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"740\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">(L-r) Chairman Bob Ayling, culture secretary Chris Smith and Peter Mandelson inspect a model of the dome, 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Stephens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mike Davies, a director of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/aug/27/richard-rogers-architecture-social-responsibility-brexit-grenfell-tower\" title=\"\">Richard Rogers</a> Partnership, the architects of the structure, arrived with the Queen and some select others by boat.

(The architect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/zaha-hadid\" title=\"\">Zaha Hadid</a>, who refused to come unless by limousine, was also one of the earlier arrivals.) At about 2.30am the head of the British Airports Authority, says Davies, \u201cgrabbed me by the throat. He said: \u2018You bastards, why didn\u2019t you let us do the security? We know how to do it.\u2019 His family had already stormed off. They were livid.\u201d From then on, says Tim Pyne, a designer who worked on several displays inside the dome, \u201cthe press came down on the whole project, and us through association, like rabid dogs\u201d. \u201cEverything went right until the opening night,\u201d says Michael Grade, the future BBC chairman who lent his expertise on showbusiness to the project, \u201cand then the world turned against us.\u201d</p> <p>The contents were panned. They were described as underwhelming, compromised, communicating nothing in particular. The long queues to get into the star exhibits made front-page news. \u201cIs this the arse or the elbow?\u201d went a <em>Private Eye</em> speech bubble, coming from a visitor trying to enter an opening in the arm of a giant figure that was in a \u201czone\u201d based on the human body. At the end of January, says Davies, \u201cthe <em>merde</em> hit the Vent-Axia\u201d: ambitious targets for visitor numbers were not being met, which meant that revenue was less than hoped. \u201cYou could blow it up,\u201d said columnist Boris Johnson later in the year, \u201c\u2026 there must be some form of public humiliation. I\u2019d like to see all those responsible for the contents of the dome eating humble pie.\u201d</p> <p>For a government famed for its supposed mastery of spin, it was about as bad a s it could get. It crystallised the doubts that floated around the New Labour project: this spectacular container of not very much made an easy emblem of the government\u2019s preference for style over content, its attachment to vacuous statements of modernity, its use of messaging and focus groups to deliver meaningless platitudes, its tokenistic approach to regeneration. \u201cI\u2019m still haunted by the experience 20 years later, it was awful,\u201d says Ben Evans, a member of Blair\u2019s 1997 election campaign team who then worked on the dome\u2019s content. Now director of the London design festival, he \u201ccame out of it thinking I was really unemployable\u201d.</p> <p>Like other works of New Labour, it was a modification of something inherited from the previous Conservative government. The project that would evolve into the dome had been enthusiastically backed by Michael Heseltine, deputy prime minister in John Major\u2019s government. It had started with the Millennium Commission, set up under Major, which was charged with spending a portion of the funds generated by the new National Lottery on things that had something or other to do with the impending new millennium. \u201cWe had billions of pounds to spend,\u201d says Simon Jenkins, journalist and a member of the commission, \u201cand why? On a date.\u201d</p> <p>One idea was for some kind of festival to celebrate this momentous moment (although, as pedants never tired of pointing out, the third millennium would technically begin on 1 January 2001). \u201cThere was a general acceptance that it would happen,\u201d says Jenkins, \u201calthough no one could think quite what it would be.\u201d Bids were invited. The shortlist of locations consisted of Birmingham, Derby, Stratford and the Greenwich Peninsular, the latter the site of a former gasworks, its soil burdened with arsenic and mercury and unexploded bombs. It was the evil twin of the better-known version of Greenwich, the one with the lawns and old ships and baroque architecture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ddcc911767dffd984093fcdcc8ec8f72c766f1b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddcc911767dffd984093fcdcc8ec8f72c766f1b2/0_0_5174_3428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The entrance to the dome\u2019s \u2018body zone\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The entrance to the dome\u2019s \u2018body zone\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greenwich won, both because it offered the opportunity for renewal of a brownfield site, and because the line of the meridian, zero degrees longitude, runs through it. Here, it was claimed, was the place where the millennium would begin. (Again, a pedant speaks: the millennium actually started on Caroline Island, Kiribati, which is just to the east of a westward-pointing projection in the International Date Line.) The Millennium Commission would run the project until a new organisation, the New Millennium Experience Company, was set up. Jennie Page, formerly of English Heritage, was appointed chief executive, first of the commission and then of the NMEC. Gary Withers, founder of the design and branding company Imagination, was invited to help deliver the project. The Richard Rogers Partnership, already responsible for masterplanning the hoped-for redevelopment of the peninsular, was also asked to advise.</p> <p>Still no one could decide what the festival was about, or what was in it. Withers, according to Mike Davies, gave a deadline of 25 March 1996 for the Commission to make up its mind. After this point he would be unable to produce the show, which was conceived as a series of pavilions in the open air, on time. The Commission didn\u2019t make up its mind. Withers said he couldn\u2019t do his job. It was then that Davies, along with his team at the Richard Rogers Partnership and the engineers BuroHappold, came up with the idea that became the dome \u2013 a great oversailing roof, in fact a tent rather than a dome, within which individual displays could be constructed. Protected from the weather, these could be simpler and quicker to build, more like stage sets than buildings. The structure that still stands was thus a clever way of buying time, a monument to the indecision of the Commission.</p> <p>With Tony Blair\u2019s election in 1997 came the danger that his predecessors\u2019 project would be cancelled. Jenkins wrote an eloquent letter on its behalf, inviting Blair to imagine the joy of his young son Euan attending the event. The cabinet, many of them sceptical, discussed it. Prescott said his piece. It was given the go-ahead, on condition that the roof covering be upgraded such that what had until now been planned as a temporary construction could become permanent. Mandelson was made the minister in charge. It was an appealing detail that his grandfather, Herbert Morrison, had played the same role for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/apr/22/iain-sinclair-festival-of-britain\" title=\"\">1951 Festival of Britain</a>, which for Jenkins and others was the main model for the proposed millennium event.</p> <p>From now on, as Jenkins puts it, it would be \u201ca showcase for New Labour, for Cool Britannia\u201d. Blair had publicly aligned himself with a vision of Britain as a creative, dynamic country: food and furniture by Terence Conran, buildings by Richard Rogers, art by Damien Hirst, music by Oasis. The dome and its contents would be its expression. Major corporations would sponsor different elements \u2013 a process that had started under Heseltine. This would show, as Jenkins puts it, \u201cthat New Labour was friendly to capitalism, that business was part of one big national family\u201d.</p> <p>It would be, if it hadn\u2019t been before, a political project, with potentially fatal consequences for true creativity. It would come with the legendary New Labour demand that everything should be on message, that interactions with the media be strictly controlled. \u201cIf you talk to the press,\u201d one participant remembers being told, \u201cwe will destroy you and you will never work again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"02b73bf9f9d37f63fe1bb6c6d031cbcd428513d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02b73bf9f9d37f63fe1bb6c6d031cbcd428513d6/0_0_3321_1890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony and Cherie Blair welcome in the new millennium alongside the Queen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"569\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony and Cherie Blair welcome in the new millennium alongside the Queen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anwar Hussein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, though, nobody knew what it was all for, or about. If Page was an able administrator (\u201ca genius,\u201d says Jenkins, \u201ca genius,\u201d Grade concurs, \u201ca very strong person,\u201d says Davies), she was no visionary. There were calls for a creative director, what Jenkins calls an \u201cimpresario\u201d, calls that were satisfied and then not satisfied by the appointment of Stephen Bayley, founding director of the Design Museum. After a difficult few months, his short-term contract was not renewed. He left a trail of eloquent barbs as he went. \u201cEvery sensible opportunity to make sense of the dome\u2019s extravagant uselessness has been ignored,\u201d he wrote in his book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/oct/30/1\" title=\"\"><em>Labour Camp</em></a>, \u201cit is a pseudo-event.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Zaha Hadid, asked to shrink her mind zone, was furious: \u2018You can\u2019t slice my work like a salami,\u2019 she said</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The hole in the dome\u2019s heart, the place where a big idea should have been, became a void into which competing interests \u2013 political, commercial, cultural, individual \u2013 rushed in. The contents would be divided into 12 \u201czones\u201d on different aspects of contemporary life \u2013 work, rest, the body, the mind etc \u2013 but it was still open what might be said about each. A \u201cLitmus Group\u201d of the great and the good was set up, to give feedback on ideas. \u201cDoes your name mean,\u201d asked one intellectual contributor, \u201cthat you change from blue to pink depending on which party is in power?\u201d</p> <p>Page had the task of reconciling the unreconcilable, with results that were broadcast in <em>The Dome: Trouble at the Big Top</em>, a BBC Two documentary series produced at the time by Robert Thirkell and Adam Wishart. They paid particular attention to the faith zone, where the architect Eva Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1 wanted to create a spiritual space specific to no particular creed. Her ideas were mashed into a pulp by the Lambeth Group, a commission of clerics consulted by Page: Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1\u2019s early proposal for an asymmetric pyramid was felt to be too pagan, too new age; the Christians in the group complained that there should be more attention to the fact that the date in question, 2000, had something to do with the birth of Jesus. The end result, in one of many moments reminiscent of <em>Spinal Tap</em>\u2019s micro-Stonehenge, included a curving plasterboard wall indented with crosses, each one carrying a TV screen in its centre.</p> <p>The designer of one of the zones now recalls an attitude that was \u201cso condescending\u201d. Zaha Hadid, asked to shrink the mind zone that she was designing, was furious. \u201cYou can\u2019t slice my work like a salami,\u201d she said. Tim Pyne recalls the pressure from sponsors: his living island zone, on the theme of the environment, had the misfortune to be sited next to the transport-themed zone, sponsored by Ford, who \u201cstarted to attack me for a negative story we were telling about car emissions\u201d. They also demanded \u201cthat we remove an old VW Beetle, and a rusty Mini Cooper from the top of our recycled white cliff because they weren\u2019t Fords. These were populist references to <em>Herbie</em> and <em>The Italian Job</em>; hardly controversial.\u201d He tried to stand his ground. \u201cThe Beetle and the Mini were craned down, however, by the NMEC as an appeasement, and replaced with Vespas. Wimps.\u201d</p> <p>All the time there was the relentless pressure of the deadline of deadlines, 31 December 1999, the one that under no circumstances could be missed. Page\u2019s achievement was to meet it, against considerable odds. But \u201cin that drive,\u201d as Ben Evans puts it, \u201canything that got in the way was swept aside\u201d. He also wants to stress that, although the project\u2019s \u00a3789m cost sounds large, the huge area of the dome meant that the \u201cper metre spend was woefully inadequate\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73fb7e9a8e26fdc697d5db746e13d9a3a549e771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73fb7e9a8e26fdc697d5db746e13d9a3a549e771/0_0_1728_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boy by Ron Mueck on display inside the dome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boy by Ron Mueck on display inside the dome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Small wonder, then, that most of those involved now describe the contents as \u201cultimately unsatisfactory\u201d, as Evans puts it. Charles Falconer, the minister who took over responsibility for the dome after Mandelson resigned from government in December 1998, now says that \u201cit didn\u2019t succeed in its short-term goals. It was meant to be an inspirational exhibition that captured the imagination of the country at the turn of the millennium, and it didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>Most, though, want to say that the show that was eventually put on wasn\u2019t all bad. The body zone, designed by Nigel Coates as a fusion of a male and a female figure, was memorable. Evans has a fond memory of the rest zone, a \u201czen-like space\u201d in which he remembers \u201ca coach-load of pensioners just lying against the wall, bathed in light. I thought: \u2018fantastic, that\u2019s worked\u2019.\u201d People speak fondly of what Grade calls the \u201cpretty sensational\u201d acrobatic performances, \u201cthe most dramatic flying that had ever been done indoors\u201d. And 6.5 million people came, making it the most visited paying attraction in Britain. The trouble was that the unrealistic figure of 12 million had, against the advice of Jennie Page and others, been made the official target.</p> <p>Most say that the dome itself, the structure of masts and its fabric covering, is what Falconer calls an \u201cinspirational building\u201d. Mike Davies emphasises its efficiency and economy: it cost \u00a343m, which is not much for something covering 87,000 square metres; at less than 20kg per sq m, it is \u201cthe lightest building in the world. That\u2019s magic stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Above all, say Falconer and others, the dome was vindicated by its \u201cenduring and powerful legacy\u201d \u2013 the still-ongoing building of homes and offices in \u201cwhat was a deprived part of London\u201d, the success of what Grade calls a \u201cbrilliant venue\u201d, the O2 Arena. What actually happened was the 48-acre site that included the dome was sold to a consortium called Meridian Delta for a nominal sum, with an additional 86 acres of adjoining land thrown in, in return for a share of future profits on the site. At the time of the transaction it was promised that \u201cup to \u00a3550m\u201d would be returned to the public purse, and at least some of it has. Nick Shattock, a developer who was part of the Meridian Delta bid, says that \u201cthe government will get far more than that. I\u2019m sure of that.\u201d He says the dome shows how \u201cevents venues can be great drivers for residential and commercial development\u201d.</p> <p>Given that the site was boosted by additional hundreds of millions of public investment \u2013 the extension of the Jubilee line there, decontamination of the land adjoining the dome site \u2013 the staging of the Millennium Experience seems like a roundabout way to achieve a profitable private-sector entertainments complex plus a development that is still not complete. Falconer, though, argues that it \u201cfocused the resources of the state\u201d on this difficult location. Regeneration there \u201ccould have happened without the dome, but it wouldn\u2019t have happened without the dome\u201d.</p> <p>More generally, it is striking on how much those involved now agree \u2013 that the main problems were political interference, the lack of creative direction or clear statement of purpose, the unrealistic target for visitor numbers, the relentless timescale and deadline, the compromises that came with large amounts of corporate sponsorship.</p> <p>My own aversion to the dome, at the time, came from its undermining of the hopes raised by the Blair government about both urban renewal and design. The talent arrayed there, which might have been put to use in the parts of cities where people actually live, was corralled into a compound. It was buried in a Thames-side bog with a plastic bag over its face. It set a pattern for the next decade of urban regeneration in which the power of iconic objects was overrated, in which bold-sounding political statements were then undermined by risk-averse delivery, in which the skills and integrity of architects and artists were crushed by the mechanics of public-private partnerships. In which partnerships the real power lay on the private side.</p> <p>At the time that Blair\u2019s cabinet gave the dome the go-ahead, it was spurred on by what Evans calls \u201cthe motivating factor of jealousy from other countries\u201d. This was to be a rival, or more, to the <em>grands projets</em> that had appeared in Paris over the previous decade. Evans also believes that the Blair government was taken by surprise by the scale of their victory in 1997: \u201cThey didn\u2019t quite see what they could do with their power.\u201d Perhaps the dome might be seen as a sign of their insecurity, a manifestation of impostor syndrome.</p> <p>Liza Fior, of muf architecture and art, whose proposal for an ice rink was binned early in the proceedings, argues that what would have been really impressive would have been to define British greatness in a different way. \u201cInstead of making exhibitions of ideas\u201d \u2013 for example, about investing in the local, or about the environment \u2013 \u201cthey could have really pursued those ideas.\u201d Well, yes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I entered through a discreet door in Whitehall, that of the Cabinet Office, and passed down a long sequence of spaces \u2013 literally, corridors of power \u2013 that run parallel to Downing Street, a few metres to the left. I continued to the point where another door or two would, were I so authorised, have got me into No 10. I was admitted to the office of Peter Mandelson, minister without portfolio, at this time in 1998 the second most powerful man in government, sometimes called the Prince of Darkness. I didn\u2019t know what to expect. Jonathan Glancey, then architecture and design editor of the Guardian, had been yelled at and threatened by a government press officer for his attacks on the Millennium Dome. I had written a front-page story for the Evening Standard, whose message \u2013 \u201cNew threats to the dome\u201d \u2013 had graced newsstands all over London. It turned out I was getting the \u201cgood cop\u201d. Mandy (as he was also tagged), reclining informally on one of the leather couches in his office, told me how terribly disappointed he was in my criticisms, as he particularly admired my writing. He complimented me on my shirt. We discussed its designer, Paul Smith, and the shop he had just opened in Notting Hill. He asked artful questions that seemed designed to extract the identity of my sources. And that was about it. But it was an unusually high degree of interest, in matters of architecture and design, for a minister in Mandelson\u2019s position to take. This was because the dome was to be the ultimate symbol of the triumph of New Labour. \u201cIf we can\u2019t make this work,\u201d the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, had said, \u201cwe\u2019re not much of a government.\u201d It was to be, said Tony Blair, \u201cBritain\u2019s opportunity to greet the world with a celebration that is so bold, so beautiful, so inspiring that it embodies at once the spirit of confidence and adventure in Britain and the spirit of the future in the world.\u201d It\u2019s strange, now, to contemplate the passions it aroused. For millions of event-goers the structure is now the O2, where Harry Styles and Diana Ross are among the forthcoming attractions. The Millennium Experience that it contained then is dimly remembered, like a TV soap opera that didn\u2019t catch on. It was eclipsed, as Blairite catastrophes go, by the invasion of Iraq three years later. In 2012 the London Olympics, many times more expensive but nonetheless perceived as a success, put the bad dream of the dome behind it. For a bad dream it was. Advance publicity had been both negative and positive. It will be a monumental cock-up, had been one narrative; the Daily Telegraph columnist Boris Johnson had said he would eat his hat if it wasn\u2019t a triumph. Then the opening night happened, 31 December 1999, which must go down as one of the greatest PR disasters in history. Thousands of VIPs, invited to celebrate this night of nights, this once-in-a-lifetime event, among them newspaper editors and the CEOs and chairs of sponsoring corporations, were made to queue for an hour or more for security checks, in the winter cold, at the tube station in Stratford, east London, from where they were to take the train to the dome. Mike Davies, a director of the Richard Rogers Partnership, the architects of the structure, arrived with the Queen and some select others by boat. They found the place emptier than expected, he recalls, leaving them to make small talk with the monarch as guests \u201cdribbled in\u201d. (The architect Zaha Hadid, who refused to come unless by limousine, was also one of the earlier arrivals.) At about 2.30am the head of the British Airports Authority, says Davies, \u201cgrabbed me by the throat. He said: \u2018You bastards, why didn\u2019t you let us do the security? We know how to do it.\u2019 His family had already stormed off. They were livid.\u201d From then on, says Tim Pyne, a designer who worked on several displays inside the dome, \u201cthe press came down on the whole project, and us through association, like rabid dogs\u201d. \u201cEverything went right until the opening night,\u201d says Michael Grade, the future BBC chairman who lent his expertise on showbusiness to the project, \u201cand then the world turned against us.\u201d The contents were panned. They were described as underwhelming, compromised, communicating nothing in particular. The long queues to get into the star exhibits made front-page news. \u201cIs this the arse or the elbow?\u201d went a Private Eye speech bubble, coming from a visitor trying to enter an opening in the arm of a giant figure that was in a \u201czone\u201d based on the human body. At the end of January, says Davies, \u201cthe merde hit the Vent-Axia\u201d: ambitious targets for visitor numbers were not being met, which meant that revenue was less than hoped. \u201cYou could blow it up,\u201d said columnist Boris Johnson later in the year, \u201c\u2026 there must be some form of public humiliation. I\u2019d like to see all those responsible for the contents of the dome eating humble pie.\u201d For a government famed for its supposed mastery of spin, it was about as bad a s it could get. It crystallised the doubts that floated around the New Labour project: this spectacular container of not very much made an easy emblem of the government\u2019s preference for style over content, its attachment to vacuous statements of modernity, its use of messaging and focus groups to deliver meaningless platitudes, its tokenistic approach to regeneration. \u201cI\u2019m still haunted by the experience 20 years later, it was awful,\u201d says Ben Evans, a member of Blair\u2019s 1997 election campaign team who then worked on the dome\u2019s content. Now director of the London design festival, he \u201ccame out of it thinking I was really unemployable\u201d.

(Again, a pedant speaks: the millennium actually started on Caroline Island, Kiribati, which is just to the east of a westward-pointing projection in the International Date Line.) The Millennium Commission would run the project until a new organisation, the New Millennium Experience Company, was set up. Jennie Page, formerly of English Heritage, was appointed chief executive, first of the commission and then of the NMEC. Gary Withers, founder of the design and branding company Imagination, was invited to help deliver the project. The Richard Rogers Partnership, already responsible for masterplanning the hoped-for redevelopment of the peninsular, was also asked to advise. Still no one could decide what the festival was about, or what was in it. Withers, according to Mike Davies, gave a deadline of 25 March 1996 for the Commission to make up its mind. After this point he would be unable to produce the show, which was conceived as a series of pavilions in the open air, on time. The Commission didn\u2019t make up its mind. Withers said he couldn\u2019t do his job. It was then that Davies, along with his team at the Richard Rogers Partnership and the engineers BuroHappold, came up with the idea that became the dome \u2013 a great oversailing roof, in fact a tent rather than a dome, within which individual displays could be constructed. Protected from the weather, these could be simpler and quicker to build, more like stage sets than buildings. The structure that still stands was thus a clever way of buying time, a monument to the indecision of the Commission. With Tony Blair\u2019s election in 1997 came the danger that his predecessors\u2019 project would be cancelled. Jenkins wrote an eloquent letter on its behalf, inviting Blair to imagine the joy of his young son Euan attending the event. The cabinet, many of them sceptical, discussed it. Prescott said his piece. It was given the go-ahead, on condition that the roof covering be upgraded such that what had until now been planned as a temporary construction could become permanent. Mandelson was made the minister in charge. It was an appealing detail that his grandfather, Herbert Morrison, had played the same role for the 1951 Festival of Britain, which for Jenkins and others was the main model for the proposed millennium event. From now on, as Jenkins puts it, it would be \u201ca showcase for New Labour, for Cool Britannia\u201d. Blair had publicly aligned himself with a vision of Britain as a creative, dynamic country: food and furniture by Terence Conran, buildings by Richard Rogers, art by Damien Hirst, music by Oasis. The dome and its contents would be its expression. Major corporations would sponsor different elements \u2013 a process that had started under Heseltine. This would show, as Jenkins puts it, \u201cthat New Labour was friendly to capitalism, that business was part of one big national family\u201d. It would be, if it hadn\u2019t been before, a political project, with potentially fatal consequences for true creativity. It would come with the legendary New Labour demand that everything should be on message, that interactions with the media be strictly controlled. \u201cIf you talk to the press,\u201d one participant remembers being told, \u201cwe will destroy you and you will never work again.\u201d Still, though, nobody knew what it was all for, or about. If Page was an able administrator (\u201ca genius,\u201d says Jenkins, \u201ca genius,\u201d Grade concurs, \u201ca very strong person,\u201d says Davies), she was no visionary. There were calls for a creative director, what Jenkins calls an \u201cimpresario\u201d, calls that were satisfied and then not satisfied by the appointment of Stephen Bayley, founding director of the Design Museum. After a difficult few months, his short-term contract was not renewed. He left a trail of eloquent barbs as he went. \u201cEvery sensible opportunity to make sense of the dome\u2019s extravagant uselessness has been ignored,\u201d he wrote in his book Labour Camp, \u201cit is a pseudo-event.\u201d The hole in the dome\u2019s heart, the place where a big idea should have been, became a void into which competing interests \u2013 political, commercial, cultural, individual \u2013 rushed in. The contents would be divided into 12 \u201czones\u201d on different aspects of contemporary life \u2013 work, rest, the body, the mind etc \u2013 but it was still open what might be said about each. A \u201cLitmus Group\u201d of the great and the good was set up, to give feedback on ideas. \u201cDoes your name mean,\u201d asked one intellectual contributor, \u201cthat you change from blue to pink depending on which party is in power?\u201d Page had the task of reconciling the unreconcilable, with results that were broadcast in The Dome: Trouble at the Big Top, a BBC Two documentary series produced at the time by Robert Thirkell and Adam Wishart. They paid particular attention to the faith zone, where the architect Eva Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1 wanted to create a spiritual space specific to no particular creed. Her ideas were mashed into a pulp by the Lambeth Group, a commission of clerics consulted by Page: Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1\u2019s early proposal for an asymmetric pyramid was felt to be too pagan, too new age; the Christians in the group complained that there should be more attention to the fact that the date in question, 2000, had something to do with the birth of Jesus. The end result, in one of many moments reminiscent of Spinal Tap\u2019s micro-Stonehenge, included a curving plasterboard wall indented with crosses, each one carrying a TV screen in its centre. The designer of one of the zones now recalls an attitude that was \u201cso condescending\u201d. Zaha Hadid, asked to shrink the mind zone that she was designing, was furious. \u201cYou can\u2019t slice my work like a salami,\u201d she said. Tim Pyne recalls the pressure from sponsors: his living island zone, on the theme of the environment, had the misfortune to be sited next to the transport-themed zone, sponsored by Ford, who \u201cstarted to attack me for a negative story we were telling about car emissions\u201d. They also demanded \u201cthat we remove an old VW Beetle, and a rusty Mini Cooper from the top of our recycled white cliff because they weren\u2019t Fords. These were populist references to Herbie and The Italian Job; hardly controversial.\u201d He tried to stand his ground. \u201cThe Beetle and the Mini were craned down, however, by the NMEC as an appeasement, and replaced with Vespas. Wimps.\u201d All the time there was the relentless pressure of the deadline of deadlines, 31 December 1999, the one that under no circumstances could be missed. Page\u2019s achievement was to meet it, against considerable odds. But \u201cin that drive,\u201d as Ben Evans puts it, \u201canything that got in the way was swept aside\u201d. He also wants to stress that, although the project\u2019s \u00a3789m cost sounds large, the huge area of the dome meant that the \u201cper metre spend was woefully inadequate\u201d. Small wonder, then, that most of those involved now describe the contents as \u201cultimately unsatisfactory\u201d, as Evans puts it. Charles Falconer, the minister who took over responsibility for the dome after Mandelson resigned from government in December 1998, now says that \u201cit didn\u2019t succeed in its short-term goals. It was meant to be an inspirational exhibition that captured the imagination of the country at the turn of the millennium, and it didn\u2019t do it.\u201d Most, though, want to say that the show that was eventually put on wasn\u2019t all bad. The body zone, designed by Nigel Coates as a fusion of a male and a female figure, was memorable. Evans has a fond memory of the rest zone, a \u201czen-like space\u201d in which he remembers \u201ca coach-load of pensioners just lying against the wall, bathed in light. I thought: \u2018fantastic, that\u2019s worked\u2019.\u201d People speak fondly of what Grade calls the \u201cpretty sensational\u201d acrobatic performances, \u201cthe most dramatic flying that had ever been done indoors\u201d. And 6.5 million people came, making it the most visited paying attraction in Britain. The trouble was that the unrealistic figure of 12 million had, against the advice of Jennie Page and others, been made the official target. Most say that the dome itself, the structure of masts and its fabric covering, is what Falconer calls an \u201cinspirational building\u201d. Mike Davies emphasises its efficiency and economy: it cost \u00a343m, which is not much for something covering 87,000 square metres; at less than 20kg per sq m, it is \u201cthe lightest building in the world. That\u2019s magic stuff.\u201d Above all, say Falconer and others, the dome was vindicated by its \u201cenduring and powerful legacy\u201d \u2013 the still-ongoing building of homes and offices in \u201cwhat was a deprived part of London\u201d, the success of what Grade calls a \u201cbrilliant venue\u201d, the O2 Arena. What actually happened was the 48-acre site that included the dome was sold to a consortium called Meridian Delta for a nominal sum, with an additional 86 acres of adjoining land thrown in, in return for a share of future profits on the site. At the time of the transaction it was promised that \u201cup to \u00a3550m\u201d would be returned to the public purse, and at least some of it has. Nick Shattock, a developer who was part of the Meridian Delta bid, says that \u201cthe government will get far more than that. I\u2019m sure of that.\u201d He says the dome shows how \u201cevents venues can be great drivers for residential and commercial development\u201d. Given that the site was boosted by additional hundreds of millions of public investment \u2013 the extension of the Jubilee line there, decontamination of the land adjoining the dome site \u2013 the staging of the Millennium Experience seems like a roundabout way to achieve a profitable private-sector entertainments complex plus a development that is still not complete. Falconer, though, argues that it \u201cfocused the resources of the state\u201d on this difficult location. Regeneration there \u201ccould have happened without the dome, but it wouldn\u2019t have happened without the dome\u201d. More generally, it is striking on how much those involved now agree \u2013 that the main problems were political interference, the lack of creative direction or clear statement of purpose, the unrealistic target for visitor numbers, the relentless timescale and deadline, the compromises that came with large amounts of corporate sponsorship. My own aversion to the dome, at the time, came from its undermining of the hopes raised by the Blair government about both urban renewal and design. The talent arrayed there, which might have been put to use in the parts of cities where people actually live, was corralled into a compound. It was buried in a Thames-side bog with a plastic bag over its face. It set a pattern for the next decade of urban regeneration in which the power of iconic objects was overrated, in which bold-sounding political statements were then undermined by risk-averse delivery, in which the skills and integrity of architects and artists were crushed by the mechanics of public-private partnerships. In which partnerships the real power lay on the private side. At the time that Blair\u2019s cabinet gave the dome the go-ahead, it was spurred on by what Evans calls \u201cthe motivating factor of jealousy from other countries\u201d. This was to be a rival, or more, to the grands projets that had appeared in Paris over the previous decade. Evans also believes that the Blair government was taken by surprise by the scale of their victory in 1997: \u201cThey didn\u2019t quite see what they could do with their power.\u201d Perhaps the dome might be seen as a sign of their insecurity, a manifestation of impostor syndrome. Liza Fior, of muf architecture and art, whose proposal for an ice rink was binned early in the proceedings, argues that what would have been really impressive would have been to define British greatness in a different way. \u201cInstead of making exhibitions of ideas\u201d \u2013 for example, about investing in the local, or about the environment \u2013 \u201cthey could have really pursued those ideas.\u201d Well, yes.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has said people convicted of terrorism offences should \u201cnot necessarily\u201d serve their full sentence, calling for an examination of how the prison system deals with such offenders. The Labour leader was speaking before a speech in York on Sunday in which he responded to Friday\u2019s terrorist attack at London Bridge by saying that Britain\u2019s repeated military interventions had \u201cexacerbated rather than resolved\u201d the problem of terrorism. Corbyn\u2019s comments came as the Ministry of Justice said it was conducting a review of licence conditions of about 70 terrorists released under licence since 2000. Usman Khan \u2013 who killed two people in the attack, before being shot dead by police \u2013 was previously jailed for an al-Qaida-inspired plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange and was wearing an electronic tag at the time of the incident. He was released from jail on licence in 2018, half way through a 16-year sentence. Asked on Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday whether people convicted of terrorism offences should serve their full sentences, the Labour leader said \u201cnot necessarily\u201d. \u201cI think it depends on the circumstances, it depends on the sentence but crucially it depends on what they have done in prison,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there has to be an examination of how our prison services work and crucially what happens to them on release from prison.\u201d He added: \u201cThere has to be an examination of what goes on in the prison because prisons ought to be a place where people are put away because of major, serious offences but also a place where rehabilitation takes place.\u201d Arguments over the blame for Friday\u2019s attack have come to dominate the election campaign, with the prime minister promising a package of hardline changes which also include mandatory minimum 14-year sentences and an end to automatic early release for terrorism and extremism offences.

That the tourists got so far as they did was down to two, familiar figures: Yasir Shah and Babar Azam. Babar fell agonisingly short of another Test century but Yasir finally got his first Test fifty, and then kept going to rack up triple figures. Their efforts kept Australia in the field longer than they would have liked, but Tim Paine still made Pakistan bat again. And, among several rain breaks, Australia\u2019s pace attack did the business to reduce the visitors to 39-3 when stumps was taken early, vindicating the decision of their skipper. Still needing another 248 runs just to make Australia bat again, Pakistan will hope for two days of solid rain. Thanks for your company.

In home conditions they are simply a much better Test cricket side than Pakistan. The one-sided nature of their win in Brisbane is being replicated here in Adelaide and a series whitewash is all but assured after only six sessions in the Athens of the south.</p> <p>Pakistan will resume on 96-6 with Australia\u2019s trio of pacemen hungry to mop up the tail and steal some of the limelight hogged yesterday by David Warner. Standing in their way is one man, Babar Azam, the only tourist capable of competing with his hosts in any discipline. He is unbeaten on 43 and his wicket will be prized more than any other.</p> <p>Otherwise today is sure to be one of reflection following Warner\u2019s extravagant feats yesterday. It baffles me that his batting has caused such a furore over the rights and wrongs of respecting historical landmarks. I thought his job was to score runs and win cricket matches. Australians have a very particular way of getting their knickers in a twist about confected rights and wrongs to do with sporting behaviour (see Warner, D: sandpaper) and this is right up there with the most peculiar of them. <br></p> <p>If you have any thoughts on Warner, Bradman, twisted knickers, or anything else cricket related, please drop me a line either on Twitter -<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft\"> @JPHowcroft</a>- or by email - <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com</a>. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDGgYrPCazA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NDGgYrPCazA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Murs here, preempting Warner upsetting the Bradmanphiles by a decade or so. </figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "A day of graft but little progress from Pakistan, who did well to reach 302 in their first innings (from 89-6 at one stage) but not well enough to avert the follow-on. That the tourists got so far as they did was down to two, familiar figures: Yasir Shah and Babar Azam. Babar fell agonisingly short of another Test century but Yasir finally got his first Test fifty, and then kept going to rack up triple figures. Their efforts kept Australia in the field longer than they would have liked, but Tim Paine still made Pakistan bat again. And, among several rain breaks, Australia\u2019s pace attack did the business to reduce the visitors to 39-3 when stumps was taken early, vindicating the decision of their skipper. Still needing another 248 runs just to make Australia bat again, Pakistan will hope for two days of solid rain. Thanks for your company. See you tomorrow. Precipitation wins in the end, as it always does, and that is all for this third day\u2019s play. Advantage remains with Australia. This shower looks a bit more menacing. The heavy covers are on. Pakistan\u2019s rain dance is working. 17th over: Pakistan 39-3 (Shan 14, Asad 8) Cummins continues, with Asad in his sights. The batsman is up to the task but Cummins can\u2019t get through his over before we have yet another rain delay. 16th over: Pakistan 39-3 (Shan 14, Asad 8) Hazlewood finishes his latest interrupted over, sending down three dot balls to Shan. Play is set to resume at 8.55pm local time, which is barely minutes away. Good good. Not sure how long this delay will last. Though thicker, this downfall doesn\u2019t look set in. Trailing by 248 runs, Pakistan will hope for monsoons. See below for a lovely shot from Babar. Before he got out. It\u2019s been all or nothing this tour from Babar, with two big scores and two misses. Does that make him mercurial? 16th over: Pakistan 39-3 (Shan 14, Asad 8) Hazlewood manages three balls of his eighth over before the umpires make the call and order players off the ground. Tim Paine isn\u2019t happy. He wants to stay out there, as you would if you were the Australia captain. But the showers are getting heavier. Rain stops play. 15th over: Pakistan 38-3 (Shan 14, Asad 7) Nice off drive by Asad earns three and gives Michael Neser, Australia\u2019s substitute fielder, something to do. Shan then steers the ball between point and gully for four, clearly getting the taste of this boundary lark. And a wonderful response from Cummins, who cuts one away from the left hander and beats the bat. A hurriedly run two then makes it nine from the over. The misty rain looks to be getting thicker. 14th over: Pakistan 29-3 (Shan 8, Asad 4) Short and then full and then short again from Hazlewood, but Shan is the picture of watchfulness until he throws caution to the wind and pulls for his first boundary. Forty-seven deliveries in the making, it was worth the wait. There\u2019s a spot or two of rain around and it\u2019s time for drinks. 13th over: Pakistan 25-3 (Shan 4, Asad 4) Good areas from Cummins to Asad and that\u2019s two maidens on the bounce. Pakistan trail by 262 runs. 12th over: Pakistan 25-3 (Shan 4, Asad 4) Failed review! Paine is convinced Shan has tickled one around his legs, despite the umpire\u2019s call of not out. The skipper and keeper confers with nobody and sends the decision straight upstairs. Sorry, Tim, no bat on that one. That makes it two successful reviews and 20 unsuccessful reviews under Paine\u2019s watch. Hazlewood collects Shan on the helmet last ball, with Paine taking the \u2018catch\u2019. A tepid appeal follows but there\u2019s no review this time. New helmet for the batsman. 11th over: Pakistan 25-3 (Shan 4, Asad 4) Cummins continues to work on Shan\u2019s off stump and the over is highlighted by an absolute belter that pitches on middle, seams away and misses both outside edge and the stumps. Really, that ball was too good to take a wicket. Asad takes strike last ball of the over and gets off the mark with a boundary as Cummins strays down leg. Both batsmen are on four - Shan has faced 36 balls, Asad just the one. 10th over: Pakistan 20-3 (Shan 3) Hazlewood gets one to nip back sharply to Babar, but it started too far outside off to be a threat. He then strays onto Babar\u2019s pads and is worked through midwicket for two. But Hazlewood soon gets his man as Babar prods at one just outside off, and there\u2019s enough lift on the ball to catch the edge en route to the keeper. A miss for Babar and not at all what Pakistan were wanting. Now three down, Pakistan trail by 267 runs. 9th over: Pakistan 18-2 (Shan 3, Babar 6) Cummins enters the attack as Starc is sent to pasture. It really is dreary in Adelaide. First day of summer and the crowd that remains are all rugged up. Over the wicket to Shan, Cummins tries in his own way to encourage the drive. And the leftie can\u2019t resist an expansive slash at one wide of off, but he hits air only. He got nowhere near it and it\u2019s a maiden for Cummins. 8th over: Pakistan 18-2 (Shan 3, Babar 6) Hazlewood continues full and outside off to Shan, working to a plan that\u2019s bore fruit in the past. Nothing doing this over, however, with Shan scampering through for a single on the last ball to retain the strike. 7th over: Pakistan 17-2 (Shan 2, Babar 6) Starc from the other end and Babar gets off the mark at the first time of asking, punching through the covers for two. And it gets even better later in the over as Babar leans back and cuts beautifully past point for four. That one came right out of the middle. Classy stuff from a classy player. 6th over: Pakistan 11-2 (Shan 2, Babar 0) Ladies and germs, we\u2019re back. Hazlewood again for Australia. Hell of a leave by Shan. Couldn\u2019t have missed the top of off by much. A maiden to begin. I was given a bum steer, which I passed onto you. Play will now resume at 7.40pm local time. So just a couple of minutes away. Babar is the new batsman. Pakistan trail by 276 runs. My do they need a knock of the ages from him, and most of the others for that matter. I bear good tidings: the covers are off, the stumps are being reinserted and we are six or so minutes away from resuming play. Some big love for Yasir Shah doing the rounds. The rain looks to have stopped, though the covers are still on. The umpires are discussing something in the middle. Either where to on Hindley St after stumps or when to resume play. Or both. Yeah, ripper of a ball from Starc. Full and venomous. Azhar had to play at it. 5th over: Pakistan 11-2 (Shan 2) Starc again. He looks a bit ginger in his follow through. Ankle possibly? There are issues as his front foot is way behind the crease on delivery. Getting windy and cold in Adelaide. New boots mid-over for Starc. He\u2019s not a happy fast bowler. What am I bid for Mitch\u2019s old boots on e-bay? And the new boots do the trick and Azhar wafts at one and picks out Smith, who dives and takes a seriously good catch low down at second slip. And it all happened under increasing rainfall, prompting players and officials to follow Azhar off the ground. Rain stopped play. 4th over: Pakistan 9-1 (Shan 2, Azhar 7) Three deliveries to finish off Hazlewood\u2019s second over. Azhar gets off the mark with a boundary but it\u2019s far from convincing as his thick edge beats third slip. A better shot follows and brings three forward of square. Big challenge here for the Pakistan skipper at No.3, which after that early loss is as good as opening anyway. Kevin Wilson asks: \u201cIs Yasir Shah the only guy to get a bowling and batting century in the same test?\u201d It\u2019s rare, Kevin, but not that rare. Not sure the exact count but I think it\u2019s happened over 50 times and I reckon Daniel Vettori might have achieved it twice. Anyone got the official figure? Dinner (not sure I\u2019ll ever get used to that term when discussing cricket) will taste that littler bit nicer for Tim Paine and Australia after they enforce the follow-on and get their breakthrough. Pakistan were gallant in that middle session but with so much ground to make up they are still nestled behind the eight ball, trailing by 200-and-plenty with the perils of the evening session to come. See you in half an hour or so. 4th over: Pakistan 2-1 (Shan 2) Hazlewood is full to Imam and gets the breakthrough, zeroing a quick one into the batsman\u2019s legs and trapping him plumb in front. Caught him flush on the crease. The batsmen confer but Shan had a good view of that at the non-striker\u2019s end and there will be no review. Australia get their wicket before the break ... and that is dinner. 3rd over: Pakistan 2-0 (Shan 2, Imam 0) Starc errs down leg side and Pakistan are away, Shan clipping him forward of square for two. Looks like there\u2019ll be another over before dinner. 2nd over: Pakistan 0-0 (Shan 0, Imam 0) Hazlewood on at the other end. The bespectacled Imam drives at a full one but gets little on it. Hazlewood fixes his length and it\u2019s consecutive maidens from Australia. Incredible stat here on Yasir\u2019s fifty, when then became a hundred, earlier on. 1st over: Pakistan 0-0 (Shan 0, Imam 0) Australia will have three overs at Pakistan before dinner. Starc opens and first ball he beats Shan\u2019s outside edge. Curious decision to make Pakistan bat again, but you do want to be bowling in these conditions. Especially with the new ball. The wind is increasing and dark clouds are swirling. Starc finishes his maiden over by getting Shan\u2019s inside edge, but the batsman\u2019s pads save the day. Interesting. After having Pakistan on the ropes at 89-6, they were out there long enough in the end. But Paine is asking his bowlers to go again. And, with the evening session to come, fair enough I guess. Musa again lives dangerously and again he survives, spooning Cummins over mid off. And again he knows little about it. But the end was always coming, and it\u2019s Yasir who ends the resistance when picking out Lyon in the deep. Pakistan trail by 287 runs. Will Australia enforce the follow-on? 94th over: Pakistan 300-9 (Yasir 112, Musa 11) More from Lyon. Nice sweep from Yasir but third man is up and it\u2019s a single only. That\u2019s the 300 up for Pakistan. Musa then gives Australia\u2019s close-in fielders a chance but his edge-onto-body clears them. 93rd over: Pakistan 299-9 (Yasir 111, Musa 11) Short again from Cummins, and I swear Yasir started to crouch down before the ball had even been released. Musa then pulls over midwicket for four. It was an amazing shot, mainly because he wasn\u2019t looking anywhere near the ball at the point of contact. That\u2019ll do me. 92nd over: Pakistan 288-9 (Yasir 107, Musa 5) Labuschagne drops a sitter. Again! Yasir pops one up to short leg, and it\u2019s right in front of Labuschagne\u2019s eyes, but somehow the chance goes begging. That\u2019s twice this dig he\u2019s dropped the century maker. Pakistan trail by 301 runs. 91st over: Pakistan 287-9 (Yasir 106, Musa 5) Short again from Cummins and this time it works, Abbas doing his level best to fend off a quick one but succeeding only in finding Warner at gully. Musa then looks to know very little about his first ball in Test cricket but he still scores a boundary from it, skied high over the slip cordon and down to the third-man fence. A single follows and Yasir then goes the tonk, getting little of it but surviving all the same. 90th over: Pakistan 280-8 (Yasir 104, Abbas 29) Lyon asks the question for leg before, but Abbas might have got an edge first. I might have been going over. It definitely isn\u2019t out. One from the over. 89th over: Pakistan 279-8 (Yasir 103, Abbas 29) And it is Cummins on from the other end. Not sure I\u2019d like 6-66 as one of my Test returns - who am I kidding, of course I would - but that might be due to watching The Exorcist at the tender age of 12. Still not over it. Cummins mixes his length but the short stuff is of no interest to Abbas, who just ducks right under. Australia then offer the most tepid appeal for a catch at short leg, but with the ball hitting thigh pad only it\u2019s easy to see why. Abbas clips Cummins past square for four to end the over. All looks rather easy right now. 88th over: Pakistan 274-8 (Yasir 102, Abbas 25) Starc has the demonic figures of 6-66, and with Lyon resuming after drinks one wonders if he\u2019ll be stuck on it. It\u2019s been almost nothing doing with the new ball - who\u2019d have thought with eight wickets down Australia would turn to spin before a wicket\u2019s been taken with the new cherry - and Lyon goes for a single in a mostly uneventful over. Many thanks, Jonathan, and top of the evening to you all. A day of resistance thus far on the part of Pakistan and missed opportunities for Australia. If they\u2019d been a bit sharper in the field, only the Lord himself (and, possibly, Mike Hussey) knows what we might be looking at right now. But pats on the back to both Yasir and Babar; their form from Brisbane was obviously no fluke. We\u2019re still looking at something grossly uneven, however, unless Pakistan can hold this rearguard pose long enough to make a game of it. Anyway, the pleasure\u2019s all mine. Please join me for some Test cricket this fine evening, the first of the summer months (if you\u2019re down this way, of course). I can be contacted by email or by Twitter - @scott_heinrich Right, that\u2019s enough of my chuntering for the day. Time for Scott Heinrich to take over. Catch you tomorrow. 87th over: Pakistan 273-8 (Yasir 101, Abbas 25) For all the fun Yasir has given us today this is turning into quite the stinker for Australia. Tim Paine has let Pakistan of the hook by being too cute with his follow-on preparations and bowling his par-timers for long spells, and questions have to be asked of the bowling attack and their lack of patience and persistence. It\u2019s a poor advertisement for the Adelaide Oval surface too, and the Kookaburra ball. I\u2019m turning into quite the grumbler, aren\u2019t I? The latest Starc over is repelled smartly by Abbas who even picks up a couple through the covers. 86th over: Pakistan 270-8 (Yasir 100, Abbas 23) Dot. Dot. Dot. Tension building. A bit of chirp in the middle. Dot. Hazlewood characteristically line and length. Swipe! Ugly, mistimed aerial swipe. Heart in mouth. The giant Starc at mid-on leaps one-handed. The ball beats the fielder by a fingernail. Helmet off. Bat raised. Ton up. 85th over: Pakistan 269-8 (Yasir 99, Abbas 23) The first signs of edginess from Yasir! He wants to tip and run and get off strike against Starc but Abbas isn\u2019t on the same page and there\u2019s an awkward couple of \u201cyes, no, waiting\u201d scenarios before he rides a short ball to point and jogs through to reach 99. Abbas has two balls to defend and he does his job with the minimum of fuss. Yasir on strike to start the next over. 84th over: Pakistan 268-8 (Yasir 98, Abbas 23) Yasir is inching towards a remarkable century. Hazlewood is on his mark but he\u2019s powerless to deny a wristy flick off a length to midwicket, or a drive to the offside sweeper. Just two more runs to go! As an aside, during the previous Starc over Pakistan ran through for a leg-bye. It was the first extra Australia had conceded all innings. 83rd over: Pakistan 265-8 (Yasir 95, Abbas 23) Starc is making this new ball fly through the air at a rapid pace, and with no little swing. Yasir can\u2019t get any bat on the balls he faces to advance his quest for a century, but fortunately for him Abbas holds his end up, blocking the straight ones, then getting an edge that flies between second and third slips but perhaps not at catchable height. 82nd over: Pakistan 260-8 (Yasir 95, Abbas 19) Hazlewood back into the attack for the first time in an age, and immediately he does Abbas with a jaffa that was, to coin a sledger\u2019s parlance, too good. A single brings Yasir on strike who is now playing like VVS Laxman, contorting his rubbery wrists to a full delivery and whipping it to square leg to move to 95. 81st over: Pakistan 258-8 (Yasir 94, Abbas 18) Starc begins the 81st over with the old ball and Yasir can\u2019t believe his luck, leg-glancing with Starc\u2019s angle from around the wicket and collecting four runs to move into the 90s. Australia then do take the shiny new pink ball but the result is the same - a Yasir four to fine-leg! This is becoming a most peculiar day of Test cricket. 80th over: Pakistan 250-8 (Yasir 86, Abbas 18) That was a fun over. Yasir, guessing it was the final over with the old ball, attempted to get to his landmark ton sooner rather than later. He earns four with a squirty square drive but is then extremely fortunate to survive a top-edged sweep off Lyon that spirals into the air and just out of reach of a diving Smith. 79th over: Pakistan 245-8 (Yasir 81, Abbas 18) Abbas blocks five balls then launches a flat bat mow to Labuschagne that whistles to the long-on fence. This is very very weird. 78th over: Pakistan 241-8 (Yasir 81, Abbas 14) Lyon continues but Abbas is watchful, defending one then rotating the strike. Yasir is now a man in a hurry, slogging hard but without timing, and fortunate to see his ugly effort land short of Starc at deep mid-on. He seems aggreived to give up the strike to Abbas but from the non-striker\u2019s end he gets to enjoy his tailend partner stroke an off drive with such timing he could be forgiven for thinking Babar never lost his wicket earlier in the day. Abbas now has his highest Test score. 77th over: Pakistan 234-8 (Yasir 80, Abbas 8) Labuschagne gets another over but Yasir is unconcerned, late cutting for a couple, wristily flicking for a brace, then drilling a straight drive for two more. This is a very odd passage of play. 76th over: Pakistan 228-8 (Yasir 74, Abbas 8) Smith is replaced after one over by Lyon but he has been Yasir\u2019s preferred bowler today and again the no. 8 tucks in, cutting for two then whipping a single to move to his highest first-class score. Abbas likes the look of Lyon too, pulling out an almighty hoick for six, out of nowhere. That was like a flash of lightning in a cloudless sky on a sunny day. 31 balls of tailend scrap and then a flicker of Shahid Afridi. You have to love cricket. 75th over: Pakistan 219-8 (Yasir 71, Abbas 2) This is spooky Sunday because Labuschagne is sharing bowling duties after tea with Smith. Presumably the prospect of a follow on remains in play and Paine is hoping to winkle out the last couple of tailenders without redlining his pacemen. I\u2019m sure that will all change by the time the new ball is due. Amongst the speculation Abbas plays out a trouble-free maiden. 74th over: Pakistan 219-8 (Yasir 71, Abbas 2) Smith does have the ball and he lands a serviceable over, but Yasir is untroubled by the variation, nudging, blocking and eventually slogging over cow corner for four. He is much more troubled by some mute calling from Abbas, only narrowly avoiding a very avoidable run out. The first interval of the day during these day-night Tests is the 20-minute one, so players are already back out in the middle awaiting the resumption of hostilities. And, unexpectedly, Steve Smith has the ball in his hands... \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of the Aussie team, partly because I think they are a microcosm of the questionable values we\u2019re fed as Australians (esp. men) \u2013 sporting achievement trumps all, the dubious concept of \u2018mateship\u2019, Don Bradman is god,\u201d emails Alex. \u201cOvertaking him would weaken this huge pillar of Australian identity. I\u2019m not against it! Surely someone has written a paper on this\u2026\u201d If not, we must put Geoff Lemon on the case forthwith. Pakistan did well to grind their way through a 150-minute session for the loss of just two wickets. Yasir has had his luck, but he\u2019s batted gamely, while Babar looked a class apart on his way to 97. Mitchell Starc changed the session in the space of two balls but Australia\u2019s inability to mop up the tail surely means any chance of a follow-on being enforced is now over. Not the best session from a catching and fielding point of view, but with the match so heavily weighted in Australia\u2019s favour I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t be overly concerned. 73rd over: Pakistan 213-8 (Yasir 66, Abbas 1) Yasir is all over Lyon now, following up his exploits of their previous duel by smoking a square drive for four. 72nd over: Pakistan 208-8 (Yasir 61, Abbas 1) Starc\u2019s decisive spell is over, so Tim Paine naturally turns to... Marnus Labuschagne. It doesn\u2019t work. Abbas dead-bats and leaves his way through a maiden. 71st over: Pakistan 208-8 (Yasir 61, Abbas 1) Who is this batsman, and what has he done with Yasir Shah? Pakistan\u2019s no. 8 is playing superbly, pulling Lyon for a boundary through midwicket then sashaying down the track and dumping the goat back over his head for four more. 70th over: Pakistan 200-8 (Yasir 53, Abbas 1) Abbas is still out there despite Starc beating the edge on a number of occasions. He even avoids falling into the short-ball trap set for him delivered with all the subterfuge of a Hanna Barbera cartoon character carrying a sign saying \u201cbouncer coming up\u201d. 69th over: Pakistan 200-8 (Yasir 53, Abbas 1) Yasir plays out a maiden against Lyon. Abbas on strike to Starc to begin the next over. 68th over: Pakistan 200-8 (Yasir 53, Abbas 1) Starc is now finding a hint of late reverse swing, meaning he is way too good for Pakistan\u2019s tail to line up with any surety. Somehow he fails to take Yasir\u2019s wicket despite a dismissal seeming inevitable. 67th over: Pakistan 197-8 (Yasir 50, Abbas 1) A hard-earned 50 for Yasir, his first in Test cricket. He\u2019s had to ride his luck at times but he\u2019s never lost his head despite a long stay at the crease. 66th over: Pakistan 195-8 (Yasir 48, Abbas 1) A momentum-changing over for Australia and further evidence of Mitchell Starc\u2019s golden arm. The wicket of Babar was batsman error but the follow-up to Shaheen was why a genuine paceman is so valuable in Test cricket. Starc now has six wickets and Paine five catches for the innings. Abbas survives the hat-trick ball. Oh lordy, that is salmon trout first ball. What is the last thing you want as a batsman first ball? A Mitchell Starc yorker of course. What did Shaheen get? A Mitchell Starc yorker. You know the rest. A forlorn review failed to overturn a very simple decision from the onfield umpire. Starc on a hat-trick! Now I\u2019m confused. This is T20 bowler rotation. Starc is back after all that end-swapping from the spinners. And would you believe it? He strikes first ball, tempting Babar into a drive outside his off stump that ends skimming off the outside edge and into the gloves of the diving Paine. Finally, a breakthrough. Heartbreak for Babar though, perishing from what was just about his only false stroke in another superb innings. 65th over: Pakistan 194-6 (Babar 97, Yasir 48) Interesting, that isolated Starc over was the missing link in a Fox, chicken, grain scenario to allow both spinners to swap ends. Lyon returns to the attack then, but he begins with a long-hop that Yasir bludgeons for four through square-leg. 64th over: Pakistan 190-6 (Babar 97, Yasir 44) Turns out Paine was just allowing Labuschagne to swap ends, and it almost works perfectly but LABUSCHAGNE DROPS A SITTER in his follow through, shelling a Yasir leading edge that lobbed straight back to him but ended up on the deck. Pakistan have enjoyed plenty of good fortune today. Meanwhile, in happier times for Labuschagne... 63rd over: Pakistan 188-6 (Babar 96, Yasir 43) Back to pace for the first time in a while with Starc replacing Labuschagne. Babar licks his lips and presents the full face of the bat to a length delivery that shoots past the bowler in his follow through before it\u2019s pulled in just before the long-off rope. Yasir tucks in too, working a couple off his hip then guiding a four behind point. That boundary was the mark of a class batsman. 62nd over: Pakistan 179-6 (Babar 93, Yasir 37) Four runs from a stock standard Lyon over. 61st over: Pakistan 175-6 (Babar 90, Yasir 36) Beautiful from Labuschagne, finding Babar\u2019s edge first ball then beating it second with a pair of perfectly flighted leggies that both turned just enough. The remainder of the over is less threatening and Babar fights back, drilling an over-pitched ball on leg stump down the ground for four then bullying a long-hop to the wide midwicket fence. 60th over: Pakistan 165-6 (Babar 80, Yasir 36) Lyon is really floating them up to Yasir now, tempting him as best he can, but despite failing to reach the pitch of the ball on a couple of occasions it\u2019s a maiden over of solid defence from the Pakistan leggy. 59th over: Pakistan 165-6 (Babar 80, Yasir 36) Labuschagne continues but he can\u2019t prevent Yasir bringing up his Cowan ton, nor can he deny Babar runs through the offside. 58th over: Pakistan 161-6 (Babar 77, Yasir 35) Kiss. Of. Death. Yasir must have telepathically read my last entry and decided to prove me wrong by dancing down the pitch to Lyon, missing with a nothing whoosh of a shot, and surviving a very obvious stumping chance only because Paine fluffed his lines behind the stumps. 57th over: Pakistan 160-6 (Babar 76, Yasir 35) A bit looser from Labuschagne this over but Pakistan fail to cash in. Yasir is showing admirable shot selection for a man with a career average of 12.72. 56th over: Pakistan 158-6 (Babar 75, Yasir 34) Lyon\u2019s turn to put his head in his hands this time with the prized wicket of Babar almost his. A flighted delivery provokes the inside-edge onto pad but the deflection floats just wide of short-leg. A bit more happening out there now with the twin spin approach. 55th over: Pakistan 158-6 (Babar 75, Yasir 34) Labuschagne sent down a good over, almost snaring a wicket with one that bounced a fraction on Yasir who was stuck on the crease, but the edge from the shoulder of the bat died quickly on Smith at slip and he couldn\u2019t jam his fingers under the ball cleanly enough to earn the benefit of any doubt. That\u2019s the second chance to fall short of slip this morning. Is the cordon too deep? You know the drill, as soon as the appeal goes up to the TV umpire with a soft-signal of not-out the foreshortened vision is only ever going to confirm the initial judgement. Smith may have caught Yasir off Labuschagne, but the soft signal is not-out. 54th over: Pakistan 156-6 (Babar 74, Yasir 33) Spin from both ends with Labuschagne and Lyon operating in tandem. Australia seem to simply be waiting for a mistake at the moment. It\u2019s still the best part of a session until the second new ball is due. Not the most thrilling spectacle. 53rd over: Pakistan 155-6 (Babar 74, Yasir 32) This might shake things up, Marnus Labuschagne is on to bowl his occasional leg-spin. It might have done, I can\u2019t tell you, because I just experienced a brief power cut. Shrug emoji. 52nd over: Pakistan 153-6 (Babar 73, Yasir 31) Australia have been surprisingly flat considering the state of play. All in all it\u2019s a bit of a soporific scene. The crowd is sparse, fielders and bowlers are going through the motions, and Pakistan are calmly going about the business of avoiding a whopping defeat. 51st over: Pakistan 151-6 (Babar 72, Yasir 30) Babar is batting with complete control at the moment and Australia look devoid of inspiration bowling to him. Even Cummins is unable to challenge Pakistan\u2019s star who impudently flicks a four through midwicket despite standing legside of a length delivery. 50th over: Pakistan 143-6 (Babar 65, Yasir 29) I reckon this partnership has done enough to end any thoughts of the follow-on being enforced (that sound you can hear is the SACA CEO counting his Christmas bonus). Lyon again looks threatening but fails to take a wicket. 49th over: Pakistan 140-6 (Babar 63, Yasir 28) Yasir is riding his luck now. After escaping all manner of dismissals in recent overs he adds \u2018almost run out\u2019 to his collection but benefits from Joe Burns missing his shy at the non-striker\u2019s end following a suicidal single. Babar restores order by leaning into a cover drive off Cummins so pure it\u2019s like a shaft of celestial light guiding humanity to a brighter future. 48th over: Pakistan 135-6 (Babar 60, Yasir 26) Yasir has got away with a couple of rash strokes at Lyon, one of those this over, when he misses a lash to cow corner. As a result he resorts to propping forward a dead-batting, but that strategy almost comes a cropper when he gets a thick edge that looks destined for Smith\u2019s safe hands at first slip but it dies just in time and arrives on the half-volley. 47th over: Pakistan 135-6 (Babar 60, Yasir 26) Cummins continues and he has a rare full over at Babar, one that ends in a maiden. It\u2019s probably worth noting Tim Paine is not in the best of health behind the stumps. He took a blow to a finger on his right hand earlier in the morning when a Starc delivery wobbled a fraction after it passed the bat and he was grimacing and shaking his glove again this over when he gathered a bouncer. 46th over: Pakistan 135-6 (Babar 60, Yasir 26) Another over, another single to Babar, another series of dots to Yasir. This time however Lyon does eventually extract a false stroke from Pakistan\u2019s no. 8, but the ambitious drive flies through the unguarded third or fourth slip region. 45th over: Pakistan 132-6 (Babar 59, Yasir 24) The pattern of the afternoon continues. Cummins bowls reasonably well, Babar rotates strike comfortably, Yasir digs in. This has not been the most thrilling 45-minutes of sport. \u201cWe\u2019ve got six rock-hard avocados on our kitchen table,\u201d sniffs Mike Atherton, covering the NZ v England Test in Hamilton. \u201cI reckon they\u2019d be more interesting to bowl with than a Kookaburra ball.\u201d I borrowed this from our NZ v England liveblog but it bears repeating here. My kingdom for some sideways movement. 44th over: Pakistan 131-6 (Babar 58, Yasir 24) It\u2019s taken 43 overs but it\u2019s finally time for spin and the introduction of Nathan Lyon. Babar is predictably unfazed, riding some extra bounce to cut behind point for three. Yasir does not look as comfortable, giving short-leg a sniff of a bat-pad chance, but he cashes in on some extra length, driving smartly through extra-cover for four. 43rd over: Pakistan 124-6 (Babar 55, Yasir 20) Cummins replaces Hazlewood but the pattern remains the same: Babar milks a single with the minimum of fuss, then Yasir unconvincingly defends his wicket. He\u2019s beaten all ends up from the final two deliveries of the over but somehow avoids an edge or the sound of his timbers rattling. 42nd over: Pakistan 123-6 (Babar 54, Yasir 20) Babar looks impregnable for Pakistan - Yasir, not so much. Since moving from over to around the wicket Starc has troubled the leg-spinner with every delivery. This over he beats the outside edge, then finds it, only to see the ball fly through the vacant gully region for four. The follow up is a slippery yorker than Yasir does well to dig out. 41st over: Pakistan 118-6 (Babar 53, Yasir 16) Into his third over of the afternoon Hazlewood has found his groove. But there\u2019s so little happening in the air or off the pitch Pakistan are able to get in line, defend securely, and accept runs when their firm pushes beat the field. It is hard going for Australia\u2019s pacemen. Should more to be done to encourage the ball to move laterally, like say, allow a certain degree of ball manipulation by the fielding side? I think so. 40th over: Pakistan 115-6 (Babar 52, Yasir 14) Yasir continues to hold his end up for Pakistan. He\u2019s not the most compact or elegant looking batsman but he has been effective so far, watching Starc closely and adapting to the range of lines and lengths the left-hander inevitably hurls down. Starc looks immediately more threatening when he moves around the wicket but some stifled appeals are as close as he comes to the first breakthrough of the day. 39th over: Pakistan 113-6 (Babar 52, Yasir 12) Yasir is farming the strike so far this morning, and it\u2019s working for Pakistan. This over he repels Hazlewood\u2019s good balls - and there are far more than in his opening over - and profits by slapping a decent short ball to the midwicket boundary. Babar has barely seen the strike but he\u2019s smoked two sumptuous fours, the latest of which clipped off his pads to bring up his half-century. 38th over: Pakistan 104-6 (Babar 48, Yasir 7) Better from Starc, beating Yasir for pace outside his off stump then finding a testing line and length and hitting the bat hard. After doing well just to prolong his stay at the crease Yasir aims a drive to the final delivery of the over and advances his score by one with a mistimed shot that runs towards deep point. Starc is bowling over the wicket to the right-handed no. 8. 37th over: Pakistan 103-6 (Babar 48, Yasir 6) Hazlewood sends down five dots to Yasir from the river end before the batsman nudges a single to the on-side. It\u2019s an unthreatening set of six that are in the main too short and too wide. This has been a sleepy start so far in the city of churches. 36th over: Pakistan 102-6 (Babar 48, Yasir 5) The day begins gently with Babar and Yasir exchanging singles off Starc before Babar, Pakistan\u2019s one genuine star, demonstrates a textbook on-drive, earning a ripple of applause when a standing ovation was probably worthy. Starc just easing into his work. Nothing notable happening in the air or off the pitch. The players are out in the middle of Adelaide Oval, Australia in cream cable-knit sweater vests, Pakistan in crisp brilliant white. Mitchell Starc has the ball in his hands. Let\u2019s do this. \u201cHow\u2019s the weather looking in Adelaide?\u201d asks Phillip Lewis by email. Well Phillip, it\u2019s chilly, blustery and overcast. It would be no surprise to see a brief shower delay play at some point but hopefully nothing worse than that. \u201cThe extra half hour means I expect 97 and a half overs in today, less 3 overs for the inevitable change of innings. With the result of the game more or less an inevitability perhaps the home team could set themselves the challenge of ensuring the over rate is in line with public and official expectations. This would be a huge boost to Test cricket around the world.\u201d You are talking my language Phillip. I am very much in the camp that thinks over-rate management should be much higher on the list of priorities for the ICC. Meanwhile in domestic cricket, the Renegades have just beaten the Thunder to seal their spot in the WBBL finals. That means Ellyse Perry and Alyssa Healy\u2019s Sixers will miss the finals for the first time. This is not the only Test cricket going on in this part of the world. Further south in Hamilton, England are staging a fightback in the second Test against New Zealand with Rory Burns and Joe Root finding form. You can catch up on that one over here. Pitch: Insert your own preferred synonym for flat. Weather: Conditions are not optimal in Adelaide, it has to be said. It is cool and windy with showers floating about. The greatest likelihood of an interruption to play will be during the second session. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of day three of the second Test between Australia and Pakistan from Adelaide Oval. A quick public service announcement before we tuck in. Play will start half-an-hour early to continue making up time lost to rain on day one. Here\u2019s today\u2019s session times in AEDT: 2pm-4.30pm | 4.50pm-6.50pm | 7.30pm-9.30pm. When play gets underway the only question that really needs answering is: how long will it take Australia to polish off victory? In home conditions they are simply a much better Test cricket side than Pakistan. The one-sided nature of their win in Brisbane is being replicated here in Adelaide and a series whitewash is all but assured after only six sessions in the Athens of the south. Pakistan will resume on 96-6 with Australia\u2019s trio of pacemen hungry to mop up the tail and steal some of the limelight hogged yesterday by David Warner. Standing in their way is one man, Babar Azam, the only tourist capable of competing with his hosts in any discipline. He is unbeaten on 43 and his wicket will be prized more than any other. Otherwise today is sure to be one of reflection following Warner\u2019s extravagant feats yesterday. It baffles me that his batting has caused such a furore over the rights and wrongs of respecting historical landmarks. I thought his job was to score runs and win cricket matches. Australians have a very particular way of getting their knickers in a twist about confected rights and wrongs to do with sporting behaviour (see Warner, D: sandpaper) and this is right up there with the most peculiar of them. If you have any thoughts on Warner, Bradman, twisted knickers, or anything else cricket related, please drop me a line either on Twitter - @JPHowcroft- or by email - jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com.",

Karen Thomas, head of the partnership, says it is frustrating that she cannot do more to help those at risk in Hemsby. \u201cWe are working very closely with the community to find something that will slow down the erosion. But even the cheapest options are multimillion-pound projects,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Just as in Cornwall, Thomas cannot afford to put in place a so-called \u201croll back scheme\u201d, where councils purchase and demolish vulnerable homes while building replacements inland. \u201cOur biggest challenge is that people might lose their homes this winter,\u201d she says. \u201cThe coastal act says local authorities can buy homes but we don\u2019t have the money to buy someone\u2019s property at a value where they can move on.\u201d</p> <p>The partnership estimates it would cost \u00a3150m over 10 years to upgrade and improve all the existing defences along the coastline of Norfolk and Suffolk. However, it would be unlikely to secure anywhere near that amount from the government. \u201cIt certainly wouldn\u2019t be half of that money,\u201d says Thomas.</p> <p>She has particularly struggled to find private backers for schemes to protect poorer communities without major private assets. \u201cWe need to do some very big projects in Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft to protect them,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it is difficult to raise partnership funding from deprived areas \u2013 they don\u2019t have industries and businesses.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, Cornwall has also failed to make up the gap. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got big enough industries,\u201d says Nolan.</p> <p>Yet there have been a few eye-catching schemes financed by the private sector. In September, Dutch engineers completed an ambitious project to better protect a gas terminal on a fast-eroding stretch of the Norfolk coast with a vast artificial sand dune, made up of 1.8 million cubic metres of sand dredged from the North Sea.</p> <p>The terminal\u2019s two operators, Shell and Perenco, paid two-thirds of the \u00a319m bill for the scheme, which is only the second of its kind anywhere in the world. The Environment Agency and local councils paid the rest. The new dunes are expected to safeguard the terminal as well as hundreds of homes in Bacton and Walcott for 15 to 20 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ba9b40163e89923fdcecaacd3fb1a3db7cfbfe1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ba9b40163e89923fdcecaacd3fb1a3db7cfbfe1/252_0_3780_2268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Marks, who oversees much of the Environment Agency\u2019s work in Looe, says the risks are growing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Marks, who oversees much of the Environment Agency\u2019s work in Looe, says the risks are growing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Wall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The engineer who came up the idea, Jaap Flikweert, says it gives residents the opportunity to prepare for coastal change. \u201cThis is about buying time.

Some would benefit from sand-scaping schemes but under the current rules it is not always possible to piece together the funding you need,\u201d he says.</p> <p>His team have identifiedabout 20 potential locations including sites in Lincolnshire, Cornwall and Suffolk. However, none have funding in place yet. The most advanced discussions are taking place in Cornwall, where the council would like to use sand-scaping to secure the future of Mount\u2019s Bay, which is named after the iconic St Michael\u2019s Mount.</p> <p>Dave Watkins, Cornwall council\u2019s flood and coastal resilience lead, is keen on replicating the Norfolk scheme yet baulks at the likely price tag of \u00a320m to \u00a330m. \u201cWe have done some work for the short term to give us breathing space in Mount\u2019s Bay,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are following Bacton very closely because we want to do a similar scheme here.

She has particularly struggled to find private backers for schemes to protect poorer communities without major private assets. \u201cWe need to do some very big projects in Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft to protect them,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it is difficult to raise partnership funding from deprived areas \u2013 they don\u2019t have industries and businesses.\u201d Similarly, Cornwall has also failed to make up the gap. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got big enough industries,\u201d says Nolan. Yet there have been a few eye-catching schemes financed by the private sector. In September, Dutch engineers completed an ambitious project to better protect a gas terminal on a fast-eroding stretch of the Norfolk coast with a vast artificial sand dune, made up of 1.8 million cubic metres of sand dredged from the North Sea. The terminal\u2019s two operators, Shell and Perenco, paid two-thirds of the \u00a319m bill for the scheme, which is only the second of its kind anywhere in the world. The Environment Agency and local councils paid the rest. The new dunes are expected to safeguard the terminal as well as hundreds of homes in Bacton and Walcott for 15 to 20 years. The engineer who came up the idea, Jaap Flikweert, says it gives residents the opportunity to prepare for coastal change. \u201cThis is about buying time. That coast is going to continue to erode but there is another decade or two for the government to come up with better ways to adapt.\u201d Flikweert, who works for Dutch engineering giant, Royal HaskoningDHV, said working with nature is much more effective than putting up traditional concrete defences, which can to lead to increased erosion further down the coast. He is pleased with his creation but wishes he could help other threatened communities in the UK. \u201cThere are many places on the coast where we know houses will be lost. Some would benefit from sand-scaping schemes but under the current rules it is not always possible to piece together the funding you need,\u201d he says. His team have identifiedabout 20 potential locations including sites in Lincolnshire, Cornwall and Suffolk. However, none have funding in place yet. The most advanced discussions are taking place in Cornwall, where the council would like to use sand-scaping to secure the future of Mount\u2019s Bay, which is named after the iconic St Michael\u2019s Mount. Dave Watkins, Cornwall council\u2019s flood and coastal resilience lead, is keen on replicating the Norfolk scheme yet baulks at the likely price tag of \u00a320m to \u00a330m. \u201cWe have done some work for the short term to give us breathing space in Mount\u2019s Bay,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are following Bacton very closely because we want to do a similar scheme here. But I don\u2019t know where the funding is going to come from.\u201d On north-west edges of Wales an even more fraught human drama is playing out \u2013 one that could well be repeated elsewhere as the century reaches its midpoint. Fairbourne, a much-loved village of 461 properties, with about 700 residents, is set to be decommissioned and possibly returned to a saltmarsh because it cannot be defended against rising sea levels. A masterplan drawn up by the Gwynedd council and Welsh government reveals that in 36 years the council will seek to relocate residents before leaving whatever remains of their homes to be washed away by the sea when the defences protecting the village stops being maintained in 2055. The masterplan, which finished its consultation period in November, warns that a failure in the defences \u201ccould result in total inundation of the village, with substantial risk to life and major economic damages\u201d. Yet the council says there is no funding to either resettle residents or pay for an equity-release scheme to allow homeowners to move. Rob Williams, Gwynedd council\u2019s flood risk manager, says the authority cannot afford to rehouse the residents on its own: \u201cWe are talking in excess of \u00a340m [to rehouse residents], but as the lead local flood authority we get a grant from the Welsh government of \u00a375,000.\u201d Just below the sea wall, Angela Thomas, the clerk of the local community council, lives with her partner, Mike Thrussell, 64, an angling journalist. Their home dates from around the time Victorian flour merchant Arthur McDougall built the resort in the late 1890s. Thomas, 67, who has been busy organising meetings for alarmed residents, says people in the village are getting on with life as best they can, but below the surface there is growing despair and anger. \u201cThere are a huge number who are feeling anxious. They are depressed. They are full of angst,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is awful.\u201d The villagers feel abandoned by the authorities. \u201cI really want to see how this country is going to deal with its first so-called climate refugees because at the moment we are getting nothing,\u201d adds Thrussell. The Welsh government said it supported Gwynedd\u2019s masterplan for Fairbourne, stressing that investment continued to be provided for the maintenance of defences: \u201cA policy of managed realignment, such as the case in Fairbourne, does not mean the complete withdrawal of support.\u201d The Environment Agency said that flood defence investment takes place where the risk is highest, wherever it is across the country. \u201cEach scheme is carefully considered to where it will benefit the most people and property,\u201d said a spokesperson. Back on Looe\u2019s quayside, the town\u2019s harbourmaster, Tina Hicks, is contemplating what will happen to her home town over the rest of the century if the latest plan fails to secure enough funding. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking but I don\u2019t think that people will want to live here or invest here,\u201d she says, glancing out of the window at all the potters, netters and trawlers rising with emerald green tide. \u201cYou\u2019ll end up with a shanty town by the sea.\u201d",

Hours earlier, in a surprise announcement, Iran\u2019s government had said it was raising the price of fuel by up to three times, adding to the strain on a population already struggling with an economy suffocated by US sanctions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9d836a66-6271-40c3-8ada-0f21f9800101\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QzHa41miHpI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The petrol-price hike would trigger what may have been the largest-scale unrest in the 40-year history of the Islamic Republic. Iranian officials this week estimated 200,000 people were involved in the protests and riots which led to 7,000 arrests and, by some estimates, the regime\u2019s deadliest-ever response to demonstrations. Amnesty International have confirmed 15 deaths in Shiraz; those on the ground say the toll is much higher.</p> \n<p>Like the rest of Iran, Shiraz was cut off from the world by an unprecedented five-day internet blackout. Precisely what transpired in the heartland of Persian culture known as the City of Roses is still unclear.</p> \n<p>But interviews with activists inside and outside Shiraz, as well as analysis of social media posts, give a glimpse of what is thought to have been one of the largest protest outbreaks in the country, incurring one of the highest known death tolls. </p> \n<p>Before the woman in the black coat leaves the petrol station, she turns to the other drivers in line, exhorting them to park their cars in the middle of the roads to protest the price increase. \u201cOn Saturday, whoever is a real man will park their car in the middle of the street,\u201d she declares from the door.</p> \n<p>By Saturday morning, people were heeding the woman and others calling for mass civil disobedience. At least one major road in Shiraz had become a parking lot. \u201cPeople are protesting and have blocked the streets completely,\u201d says a voice, surveying the sea of cars in both directions in an industrial area of the city. Drivers gather in groups outside their cars, chatting. The vehicles curve along the palm-lined road to the edge of the frame.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B46j5orBTAY/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhat are you scared of?\u201d the woman in the black coat shouts. \u201cHelp me to understand.\u201d She marches up to a man in uniform guarding the petrol station. \u201cYou\u2019re ruining us,\u201d she screams, as the man walks away. The exchange comes from footage taken around 1am on Friday 15 November in the south-central Iranian city of Shiraz. Hours earlier, in a surprise announcement, Iran\u2019s government had said it was raising the price of fuel by up to three times, adding to the strain on a population already struggling with an economy suffocated by US sanctions. The petrol-price hike would trigger what may have been the largest-scale unrest in the 40-year history of the Islamic Republic. Iranian officials this week estimated 200,000 people were involved in the protests and riots which led to 7,000 arrests and, by some estimates, the regime\u2019s deadliest-ever response to demonstrations. Amnesty International have confirmed 15 deaths in Shiraz; those on the ground say the toll is much higher. Like the rest of Iran, Shiraz was cut off from the world by an unprecedented five-day internet blackout. Precisely what transpired in the heartland of Persian culture known as the City of Roses is still unclear. But interviews with activists inside and outside Shiraz, as well as analysis of social media posts, give a glimpse of what is thought to have been one of the largest protest outbreaks in the country, incurring one of the highest known death tolls. Before the woman in the black coat leaves the petrol station, she turns to the other drivers in line, exhorting them to park their cars in the middle of the roads to protest the price increase. \u201cOn Saturday, whoever is a real man will park their car in the middle of the street,\u201d she declares from the door. By Saturday morning, people were heeding the woman and others calling for mass civil disobedience. At least one major road in Shiraz had become a parking lot. \u201cPeople are protesting and have blocked the streets completely,\u201d says a voice, surveying the sea of cars in both directions in an industrial area of the city. Drivers gather in groups outside their cars, chatting. The vehicles curve along the palm-lined road to the edge of the frame. As the day went on, protesters were pouring into the streets of outer-lying areas across the city, according to activists. Social media footage shows significant unrest in at least six spots. The two most prominent incidents were in the suburb of Sadra and on Maliabad Boulevard, a long thoroughfare of banks and retailers that cuts across northern Shiraz. The rallies were peaceful, and at first, so was the state response. Footage shows demonstrators applauding as police in riot gear are handed flowers. Protesters say they sat in groups on the road, chanting and playing cards. Later, a protester would record a voice message to the US-based Iranian activist Masih Alinejad, reflecting on the morning. \u201cEverything was going well and people were all smiling and happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw people giving roses to the police, the first days was very peaceful and it was all good. Even the police were fine.\u201d It did not last. Footage that activists believe was shot on Maliabad Boulevard the same day appears to show security personnel charging through crowds, sending people fleeing. Clouds of what appears to be tear gas can be seen forming. There also appears to have been rioting: a video said to have been shot in the city shows fires burning in several spots, a handful of shops gutted, and the road scattered with paper and debris. \u201cThe youth has no future in this country with these thieves in power,\u201d a protester tells Alinejad in a voice recording heard by the Guardian. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t take it anymore and they were full of rage. They took things to another level.\u201d \u201cThings started to escalate when the police started to beat people up. We had to make our weapons to defend ourselves and that was it. It was all because we had to defend our lives.\u201d The protesters, including many from working-class neighbourhoods, brawled with security personnel in some areas, using nails pushed through bottle caps as makeshift spikes to puncture the tyres of police motorcycles and cars. At some point that afternoon, the police started shooting. Activists have posted footage from Saturday that shows gunshots going off near a Maliabad Boulevard police station. \u201cThis is Shiraz and the armed forces are firing at the people,\u201d says a man filming outside the police station in another clip.

      "body": "<p>Over the years, Noah Baumbach, the American writer/director, has made films about all sorts of things. <em>Kicking and Screaming</em> (1995) is about a group of college pals who refuse to move on with their lives. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/05/while-were-young-review-noah-baumbach-kermode\" title=\"\">While We\u2019re Young (2014)</a></em> is about a friendship between a middle-aged documentary-maker and his wife, and a couple in their 20s. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/15/the-meyerowitz-stories-review-noah-baumbach-dustin-hoffman-ben-stiller\" title=\"\">The Meyerowitz Stories (2017)</a></em> is about siblings attempting to live in the shadow of their egomaniacal artist father. But for some of us, he really has only one true subject: D-I-V-O-R-C-E. Consider the best movies of his career so far, made almost 15 years apart: <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/apr/09/philipfrench1\" title=\"\">The Squid and the Whale (2005)</a></em>, the bittersweet picture that first brought him to most people\u2019s attention, is about divorce, and so, too, is <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/17/marriage-story-review-scarlett-johansson-adam-driver-noah-baumbach-best-film-yet\" title=\"\">Marriage Story</a></em>, his hotly Oscar-tipped new film. To pinch from Philip Larkin, separation is to Baumbach what daffodils were to Wordsworth.</p> <p>Not that he sees it quite like this. When we meet in a clattering New York restaurant on a cold, bright autumn morning, Baumbach is annoyingly keen to resist my passionately held theory that people whose parents split up when they were children (him, me) grow up to be somewhat preoccupied by divorce, a fascination that will probably end (at least in my case) only with death. \u201cYes, both those films are about divorce,\u201d he says, in his careful, rather ponderous way. \u201c<em>The Squid and the Whale</em> from the kids\u2019 perspective, and <em>Marriage Story</em> from that of the adults. But what they also provide narratively is the opportunity to talk about other things.\u201d I stare at him. What other things? What can he possibly mean?</p> <p>\u201cWell, <em>Squid</em> is about family,\u201d he says, with the kind of patience a therapist might reserve for a particularly anxious patient. \u201cIt\u2019s really about the necessary movement away from our parents, whether divorced or not, and their conscious or unconscious tugging back [of us]. And although <em>Marriage Story</em> is about the disintegration of a marriage, it enables you to look at marriage itself, too.\u201d Both films, he insists, are surprisingly hopeful, in spite of what I regard as all the evidence to the contrary. \u201cNo, no,\u201d he tells me, reassuringly. \u201cThey\u2019re really about starting again.\u201d</p> <p>Baumbach, who is a boyish 50, has the kind of hairstyle that manages somehow to be both long and short, and the kind of clothes that pull off the rare feat of appearing both pin-neat and artfully dishevelled. He looks, in other words, like a cross between a university lecturer and an assistant in Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. He also looks exhausted. The shadows under his eyes match the navy of his boiled wool blazer; he clings to his coffee cup as if to a life buoy. But this is hardly surprising. His schedule appears to be quite mad. This morning, I was woken at 5am by a message informing me that our encounter might be off because he was going to have to fly at short notice to Los Angeles to appear in a Q&amp;A at a film festival \u2013 and, in fact, when he leaves here that\u2019s exactly what he will be doing. Even as we speak, a frazzled PR is standing at the door, stopwatch in hand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9d721013fa14f21163b1f8a99227cbcba5da4ee2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d721013fa14f21163b1f8a99227cbcba5da4ee2/0_261_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver in Baumbach\u2019s latest, Marriage Story.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver in Baumbach\u2019s latest, Marriage Story.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis has been going on since Venice in late August,\u201d he says. Not that he\u2019s complaining. He could hardly be more gracious: \u201cWhen you finish something, you don\u2019t come out of the gate with a fully formed idea of what you\u2019ve done. In a way, I feel talking about the movie, and hearing what other people think about it, helps me to understand it better myself.\u201d The beauty of a film like <em>Marriage Story</em>, he thinks, is that people bring their own stuff to it, and thus the conversations he has about it tend to be as much about life as about the film itself. But in any case, irrespective of the demands of producer/distributor Netflix, which clearly hopes <em>Marriage Story</em> is going to win it an Oscar, I think he feels a certain duty of care.</p> <p>When he was growing up, lots of people used to make films like his: interior dramas (though his movies undoubtedly have their blackly funny moments, they can hardly be accurately described as comedies) starring east coast liberal intellectual types with extensive bookshelves, subscriptions to the <em>New Yorker</em> and complicated emotional lives. Nowadays, though, they\u2019re increasingly a rarity. He is determined to do his best to \u201carticulate something that is essentially inarticulate by design\u201d to the press and to festival audiences alike.</p> <p>In <em>Marriage Story</em>, Scarlett Johansson plays Nicole, an actor, and Adam Driver her estranged husband, Charlie, a perfectionist director of edgy off-Broadway theatre. We know that Nicole and Charlie were once madly in love \u2013 as the film opens, we hear Charlie describing all the things he adored about her when they first met \u2013 but somewhere along the way, their relationship has broken down. Having previously turned her back on Hollywood in favour of working in New York with Charlie\u2019s theatre company, Nicole has now returned to LA with their eight-year-old son, Henry, to star in a TV series.</p> <p>The film depicts not only the couple\u2019s increasingly toxic custody battle \u2013 it comes with brilliant turns from Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta, all of whom play divorce lawyers of varying degrees of rapaciousness, and from Mary Hollis Inboden as a terrifyingly silent family court representative \u2013 but also its subtle effects on their sense of identity. It is in some ways a movie about power. As Nicole grows ever stronger, her world expanding, her voice becoming louder and more confident, Charlie is ever quieter and more fragile. On Halloween, when he dresses up as the invisible man, the bandages he wraps around his face speak volumes. It\u2019s as if he is determined to erase himself before someone else does.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ee63aaa29e479cd9a2028cd99396111e715d68a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ee63aaa29e479cd9a2028cd99396111e715d68a/0_207_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Watts in While We\u2019re Young from 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomi Watts in While We\u2019re Young from 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Rudin Prod</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Can Baumbach remember the tug on the line that was the beginning of this film? \u201cIt really isn\u2019t possible to do that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so\u2026 these things are garnered all the time. I often have a lot of\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t even call them ideas. Sometimes, they\u2019re ideas, but it can also be an atmosphere, a line, a relationship, a location. These things are in a notebook, and in my head, and then they keep finding their way back to whatever I\u2019m working on. Something will return, and I won\u2019t know where to put it. It will keep bouncing around until, at a certain point, it\u2019s like the electrical current in a dead wire suddenly goes on \u2013 and then that wire is the one, and I start looking at it in a way that I wasn\u2019t before. When I started writing this movie \u2013 well, the actual writing was probably only six months or something, but all the stuff that went into it you can\u2019t quantify.\u201d</p> <p>So in the beginning, he\u2019s basically a kind of ambulant whiteboard? He smiles. \u201cYes. In this case, I was working on <em>The Meyerowitz Stories</em> and things got auditioned in that script, and then they got kicked out, and then they found their way into this one.\u201d</p> <p>Aware that a film about a custody battle might be gruelling, he knew it was vital that the audience have a sense of Nicole and Charlie\u2019s former happiness: hence the early scene \u2013 an extended flashback \u2013 during which Charlie lists his wife\u2019s virtues. \u201cI wanted that to feel very immediate and intimate and active, knowing that very soon it was all going to be destroyed,\u201d he says. \u201cThe audience need that memory for perspective. I wanted people to feel as though they had been inside this family, however embarrassing that might be \u2013 because after this, the journey is into all these sterile office environments and courtrooms. We\u2019re going to be wrenched out of home life. In fact, the notion of home life is going to be completely redefined.\u201d</p> <p>Baumbach went through a separation himself some years ago; he and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/04/jennifer-jason-leigh-tarantino-woody-allen-family-patrick-melrose\" title=\"\">Jennifer Jason Leigh</a>, with whom he has a son, Rohmer (named after the French film director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/26/eric-rohmer-everyday-miracles-new-wave-master\" title=\"\">Eric Rohmer</a>), divorced in 2013; he now lives with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/04/greta-gerwig-lady-bird-interview-metoo-oscars\" title=\"\">Greta Gerwig</a>, the actor and director, with whom he has a new baby (they met in 2010, when she starred in his film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/13/greenberg-philip-french-review\" title=\"\">Greenberg</a></em>, though their relationship did not begin until later). To what degree, then, is Charlie a version of himself? \u201cHe\u2019s not me any more than Nicole is,\u201d he says. And whose side is the film on? Some people think that Nicole fades from view; that in the end, it comes down, for whatever reason, on Charlie\u2019s side. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that view. But if anything, this movie only illustrates that to take sides at all is folly. When it begins, we\u2019re with her: we\u2019re in LA, where she grew up, with her mum and her sister. She\u2019s telling her story. But then he turns up, and we drift into his. I feel like the job of the last part of the movie is to say: it\u2019s all true, and none of it\u2019s true. These are just people trying their best. Her story is one of momentum, rebuilding and finding her voice, and his is a story of breaking down; it\u2019s a kind of role reversal, because he\u2019s a director and she\u2019s an actor \u2013 not that I want to stereotype those roles. But I also think that her monologue and his song at opposite ends of the movie are mirror images of something: in a way, both of them find their voice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1843f9864a2f51edc7a2bce7ca2338d094d1ced8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1843f9864a2f51edc7a2bce7ca2338d094d1ced8/0_134_2840_1704/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney in Baumbach\u2019s 2005 film The Squid and the Whale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney in Baumbach\u2019s 2005 film The Squid and the Whale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The song in question is Being Alive, from Stephen Sondheim\u2019s <em>Company</em>. Charlie sings it in a bar, with exquisite sincerity and immense feeling, watched by members of his theatre company, and it\u2019s extraordinary: an epiphany that seems to come out of nowhere, and somehow puts a bow around the whole film. Baumbach nods: \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that you needed it, right?\u201d This is true, but it also raises the question: how did <em>he</em> know that I needed it? For a few moments, he tries to explain \u2013 something about avatars and voices and perspective \u2013 but in the end, perhaps it simply comes down to this. Driver loves that song, and its lyrics speak to one of the film\u2019s themes, which has to do with the fact that just as familiarity can breed contempt, perhaps one can only feel truly alive when one is absolutely loved and seen (\u201cSomebody pull me up short/And put me through hell/And give me support\u201d). Anyway, it\u2019s perfect. That was the moment when, sitting there in the dark, something inside me gave way, and my eyes filled with tears.</p> <p>Why does Baumbach think people get married at all \u2013 especially people like us, whose parents failed at it several times? \u201cOh, boy.\u201d Looking agonised, he puts his forehead in his hand. \u201cUm, um \u2026 Well, why <em>wouldn\u2019t</em> people get married? It\u2019s a very\u2026 hopeful, very\u2026 brave thing, getting married. It\u2019s great that people want to do that. It\u2019s a great act of hope. It\u2019s\u2026 romantic. Perhaps it has to do with repair as well: that\u2019s something we\u2019re all doing, in our different ways. Whatever our family damage is, repair takes a lot of forms.\u201d Can those who have been through a painful divorce \u2013 though not all divorces are, or need to be, painful \u2013 ever recover from the experience? \u201cIt\u2019s like any childhood event or trauma \u2026 it\u2019s up to us. As the Wallace Shawn character says [Shawn plays an actor in Charlie\u2019s company who functions as an occasional Greek chorus]: it\u2019s going to be horrible, but it\u2019s also going to be over.\u201d A pause. \u201cThough as we know, it keeps going, too.\u201d</p> <p>Baumbach grew up in Brooklyn, the older son of the novelist Jonathan Baumbach (who was married four times) and Georgia Brown, a film critic at the <em>Village Voice</em> (she was Jonathan\u2019s third wife). He was 14 when his parents separated. He remembers it vividly. He went out to watch Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas in <em>Romancing the Stone,</em> having been warned that when he got home there was going to be a family meeting \u2013 a scene he reprises beautifully in the semi- autobiographical <em>The Squid and the Whale</em>, in which Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels play a version of his parents \u2013 and he knew perfectly well what <em>that</em> meant: \u201cI watched the movie with some sense of dread, though I guess it took me out of my head for a while.\u201d He began to cry even before his parents announced their complicated custody arrangements (in the interests of fairness, the two boys would visit their father every Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday, and every other Thursday). Has he seen <em>Romancing the Stone</em> since, or are the glorious adventures of Turner and Douglas in the Colombian jungle forever ruined for him? He laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen it for years. But I liked it at the time. Doesn\u2019t Michael Douglas end up in a boat on Central Park South or something?\u201d</p> <p>Did he always know that he wanted to make films? \u201cI had, at least, the dream. I didn\u2019t know anyone in film, so I didn\u2019t know it was possible. I wanted to do it, and I would say that I wanted to do it, but there was a second voice in my head that said: well, how would that even happen? But I did a lot of plays, and wrote stories, and when VHS happened, I got a camcorder and lugged that around. VHS was amazing. You could watch movies at home, and you didn\u2019t have to wait till Easter to see <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> or whatever.\u201d Did it help that his parents led creative lives? \u201cIt did, and they loved movies, too.\u201d He has said that his father took him to see Truffaut\u2019s <em>The Wild Child</em> when he was just five, or thereabouts. \u201cI was lucky to have them as an example, though it also created its own burdens and challenges. I guess film, for me, was both a kind of inheritance, and a way of doing something different [from them].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4ed6e8f9deefa469aa6e837841eeea4016969fc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ed6e8f9deefa469aa6e837841eeea4016969fc1/0_138_2737_1642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eric Stoltz in 1995\u2019s Kicking and Screaming. \u2018His character was just slapped on,\u2019 says Baumbach.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eric Stoltz in 1995\u2019s Kicking and Screaming. \u2018His character was just slapped on,\u2019 says Baumbach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baumbach studied English at Vassar College, where he wrote, directed and acted in plays, but made no movies, largely on account of the fact that its film department had no decent equipment. How, then, did it happen that he came to release his first film, <em>Kicking and Screaming</em>, when he was only 26? He shakes his head. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a good story. Except to say that I\u2019d worked on a script, and I had two good friends who were my housemates in senior year, Jason Blum and Jeremy Kramer, who are both still in films, and the three of us would give it to anyone we could. Again, we had no idea how it worked, and it fell apart many times, even in pre-production. It was so random. The video company involved threatened to pull out at one point, and I had to write the part Eric Stoltz plays at the last minute to get it financed. His character was just slapped on.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI was in LA, and I felt so old, and yet I was so young. I just thought it was all too good to be true.\u201d</p> <p>And in a way, it was. A second film, <em>Mr Jealousy</em>, followed, after which there was a quite long period of silence. \u201cYeah. What happened? It was hard for me. I went through this time after <em>Mr Jealousy</em>: I\u2019d had this early opportunity, and then I was having trouble getting anything made. I was writing pilots, things like that. I was staying busy and making a living, but not the living I wanted. I began to wonder: am I a film-maker? Will I ever make another one? I didn\u2019t think about quitting, but it was really difficult. What I ended up doing was working on myself. I went into therapy. I grew up a bit. I started to understand myself better, and because of that I started to write and think more creatively. Then I wrote <em>The Squid and the Whale</em>. I had a breakthrough. It was a case of: I\u2019m not the film-maker I thought I was.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"47dce2227040fb762f207c5db42285a6fff7da05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47dce2227040fb762f207c5db42285a6fff7da05/0_231_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baumbach with his partner, actor and director Greta Gerwig, at the New York premiere of Marriage Story last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baumbach with his partner, actor and director Greta Gerwig, at the New York premiere of Marriage Story last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marion Curtis/StarPix for Netflix/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other thing that helped was his friendship with the film-maker Wes Anderson, with whom he wrote <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/feb/20/philipfrench\" title=\"\">The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou</a></em> (2004) and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/25/fantastic-mr-fox-review\" title=\"\">Fantastic Mr Fox</a></em> (2009). \u201cWe were both friends with [the director] Peter Bogdanovich, and we would hear about each other. We finally met at a John Waters premiere in 1998; afterwards, we ended up at a bar in Soho called Toad Hall. We started talking, and we realised we shared a lot of likes: when we exchanged numbers, we realised we both had the same kind of notebook in our pockets. He was making <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/17/features.review\" title=\"\">The Royal Tenenbaums</a></em>, and just watching how he did it was so inspiring to me. His work ethic, his precision.\u201d Anderson went on to co-produce <em>The Squid and the Whale</em>.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of film-makers are nice,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it can be tough. Directing is lonely. Mike Nichols said a director always needs a buddy, and that\u2019s wise: to have a producing partner, or a writer. Though if you write and direct, obviously you don\u2019t have a writer.\u201d These days, however, he has Gerwig, with whom he wrote two films, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/28/frances-ha-gerwig-baumbach-review\" title=\"\">Frances Ha</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/16/mistress-america-review-noah-baumbach-greta-gerwig\" title=\"\">Mistress America</a></em>. \u201cThe press part is harder, because we\u2019re on different schedules. But in terms of the rest of it, for us, it\u2019s nice.\u201d Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott\u2019s <em>Little Women</em>, starring Meryl Streep and Saoirse Ronan, opens at Christmas. He beams. \u201cOh, it\u2019s great. When you see it, you\u2019ll realise immediately. You\u2019ll think: of <em>course</em>, this is why she did it.\u201d</p> <p>For his own part, he has no idea what he\u2019ll do next. \u201cI was with Adam [Driver] last night, having the conversations we tend to have: how about this?

      "bodyText": "Over the years, Noah Baumbach, the American writer/director, has made films about all sorts of things. Kicking and Screaming (1995) is about a group of college pals who refuse to move on with their lives. While We\u2019re Young (2014) is about a friendship between a middle-aged documentary-maker and his wife, and a couple in their 20s. The Meyerowitz Stories (2017) is about siblings attempting to live in the shadow of their egomaniacal artist father. But for some of us, he really has only one true subject: D-I-V-O-R-C-E. Consider the best movies of his career so far, made almost 15 years apart: The Squid and the Whale (2005), the bittersweet picture that first brought him to most people\u2019s attention, is about divorce, and so, too, is Marriage Story, his hotly Oscar-tipped new film. To pinch from Philip Larkin, separation is to Baumbach what daffodils were to Wordsworth. Not that he sees it quite like this. When we meet in a clattering New York restaurant on a cold, bright autumn morning, Baumbach is annoyingly keen to resist my passionately held theory that people whose parents split up when they were children (him, me) grow up to be somewhat preoccupied by divorce, a fascination that will probably end (at least in my case) only with death. \u201cYes, both those films are about divorce,\u201d he says, in his careful, rather ponderous way. \u201cThe Squid and the Whale from the kids\u2019 perspective, and Marriage Story from that of the adults. But what they also provide narratively is the opportunity to talk about other things.\u201d I stare at him. What other things? What can he possibly mean? \u201cWell, Squid is about family,\u201d he says, with the kind of patience a therapist might reserve for a particularly anxious patient. \u201cIt\u2019s really about the necessary movement away from our parents, whether divorced or not, and their conscious or unconscious tugging back [of us]. And although Marriage Story is about the disintegration of a marriage, it enables you to look at marriage itself, too.\u201d Both films, he insists, are surprisingly hopeful, in spite of what I regard as all the evidence to the contrary. \u201cNo, no,\u201d he tells me, reassuringly. \u201cThey\u2019re really about starting again.\u201d Baumbach, who is a boyish 50, has the kind of hairstyle that manages somehow to be both long and short, and the kind of clothes that pull off the rare feat of appearing both pin-neat and artfully dishevelled. He looks, in other words, like a cross between a university lecturer and an assistant in Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. He also looks exhausted. The shadows under his eyes match the navy of his boiled wool blazer; he clings to his coffee cup as if to a life buoy. But this is hardly surprising. His schedule appears to be quite mad. This morning, I was woken at 5am by a message informing me that our encounter might be off because he was going to have to fly at short notice to Los Angeles to appear in a Q&amp;A at a film festival \u2013 and, in fact, when he leaves here that\u2019s exactly what he will be doing. Even as we speak, a frazzled PR is standing at the door, stopwatch in hand. \u201cThis has been going on since Venice in late August,\u201d he says. Not that he\u2019s complaining. He could hardly be more gracious: \u201cWhen you finish something, you don\u2019t come out of the gate with a fully formed idea of what you\u2019ve done. In a way, I feel talking about the movie, and hearing what other people think about it, helps me to understand it better myself.\u201d The beauty of a film like Marriage Story, he thinks, is that people bring their own stuff to it, and thus the conversations he has about it tend to be as much about life as about the film itself. But in any case, irrespective of the demands of producer/distributor Netflix, which clearly hopes Marriage Story is going to win it an Oscar, I think he feels a certain duty of care. When he was growing up, lots of people used to make films like his: interior dramas (though his movies undoubtedly have their blackly funny moments, they can hardly be accurately described as comedies) starring east coast liberal intellectual types with extensive bookshelves, subscriptions to the New Yorker and complicated emotional lives. Nowadays, though, they\u2019re increasingly a rarity. He is determined to do his best to \u201carticulate something that is essentially inarticulate by design\u201d to the press and to festival audiences alike. In Marriage Story, Scarlett Johansson plays Nicole, an actor, and Adam Driver her estranged husband, Charlie, a perfectionist director of edgy off-Broadway theatre. We know that Nicole and Charlie were once madly in love \u2013 as the film opens, we hear Charlie describing all the things he adored about her when they first met \u2013 but somewhere along the way, their relationship has broken down. Having previously turned her back on Hollywood in favour of working in New York with Charlie\u2019s theatre company, Nicole has now returned to LA with their eight-year-old son, Henry, to star in a TV series. The film depicts not only the couple\u2019s increasingly toxic custody battle \u2013 it comes with brilliant turns from Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta, all of whom play divorce lawyers of varying degrees of rapaciousness, and from Mary Hollis Inboden as a terrifyingly silent family court representative \u2013 but also its subtle effects on their sense of identity. It is in some ways a movie about power. As Nicole grows ever stronger, her world expanding, her voice becoming louder and more confident, Charlie is ever quieter and more fragile. On Halloween, when he dresses up as the invisible man, the bandages he wraps around his face speak volumes. It\u2019s as if he is determined to erase himself before someone else does. Can Baumbach remember the tug on the line that was the beginning of this film? \u201cIt really isn\u2019t possible to do that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so\u2026 these things are garnered all the time. I often have a lot of\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t even call them ideas. Sometimes, they\u2019re ideas, but it can also be an atmosphere, a line, a relationship, a location. These things are in a notebook, and in my head, and then they keep finding their way back to whatever I\u2019m working on. Something will return, and I won\u2019t know where to put it. It will keep bouncing around until, at a certain point, it\u2019s like the electrical current in a dead wire suddenly goes on \u2013 and then that wire is the one, and I start looking at it in a way that I wasn\u2019t before. When I started writing this movie \u2013 well, the actual writing was probably only six months or something, but all the stuff that went into it you can\u2019t quantify.\u201d So in the beginning, he\u2019s basically a kind of ambulant whiteboard? He smiles. \u201cYes. In this case, I was working on The Meyerowitz Stories and things got auditioned in that script, and then they got kicked out, and then they found their way into this one.\u201d Aware that a film about a custody battle might be gruelling, he knew it was vital that the audience have a sense of Nicole and Charlie\u2019s former happiness: hence the early scene \u2013 an extended flashback \u2013 during which Charlie lists his wife\u2019s virtues. \u201cI wanted that to feel very immediate and intimate and active, knowing that very soon it was all going to be destroyed,\u201d he says. \u201cThe audience need that memory for perspective. I wanted people to feel as though they had been inside this family, however embarrassing that might be \u2013 because after this, the journey is into all these sterile office environments and courtrooms. We\u2019re going to be wrenched out of home life. In fact, the notion of home life is going to be completely redefined.\u201d Baumbach went through a separation himself some years ago; he and Jennifer Jason Leigh, with whom he has a son, Rohmer (named after the French film director Eric Rohmer), divorced in 2013; he now lives with Greta Gerwig, the actor and director, with whom he has a new baby (they met in 2010, when she starred in his film Greenberg, though their relationship did not begin until later). To what degree, then, is Charlie a version of himself? \u201cHe\u2019s not me any more than Nicole is,\u201d he says. And whose side is the film on? Some people think that Nicole fades from view; that in the end, it comes down, for whatever reason, on Charlie\u2019s side. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that view. But if anything, this movie only illustrates that to take sides at all is folly. When it begins, we\u2019re with her: we\u2019re in LA, where she grew up, with her mum and her sister. She\u2019s telling her story. But then he turns up, and we drift into his. I feel like the job of the last part of the movie is to say: it\u2019s all true, and none of it\u2019s true. These are just people trying their best. Her story is one of momentum, rebuilding and finding her voice, and his is a story of breaking down; it\u2019s a kind of role reversal, because he\u2019s a director and she\u2019s an actor \u2013 not that I want to stereotype those roles. But I also think that her monologue and his song at opposite ends of the movie are mirror images of something: in a way, both of them find their voice.\u201d The song in question is Being Alive, from Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Company. Charlie sings it in a bar, with exquisite sincerity and immense feeling, watched by members of his theatre company, and it\u2019s extraordinary: an epiphany that seems to come out of nowhere, and somehow puts a bow around the whole film. Baumbach nods: \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that you needed it, right?\u201d This is true, but it also raises the question: how did he know that I needed it? For a few moments, he tries to explain \u2013 something about avatars and voices and perspective \u2013 but in the end, perhaps it simply comes down to this. Driver loves that song, and its lyrics speak to one of the film\u2019s themes, which has to do with the fact that just as familiarity can breed contempt, perhaps one can only feel truly alive when one is absolutely loved and seen (\u201cSomebody pull me up short/And put me through hell/And give me support\u201d). Anyway, it\u2019s perfect. That was the moment when, sitting there in the dark, something inside me gave way, and my eyes filled with tears. Why does Baumbach think people get married at all \u2013 especially people like us, whose parents failed at it several times? \u201cOh, boy.\u201d Looking agonised, he puts his forehead in his hand. \u201cUm, um \u2026 Well, why wouldn\u2019t people get married? It\u2019s a very\u2026 hopeful, very\u2026 brave thing, getting married. It\u2019s great that people want to do that. It\u2019s a great act of hope. It\u2019s\u2026 romantic. Perhaps it has to do with repair as well: that\u2019s something we\u2019re all doing, in our different ways. Whatever our family damage is, repair takes a lot of forms.\u201d Can those who have been through a painful divorce \u2013 though not all divorces are, or need to be, painful \u2013 ever recover from the experience? \u201cIt\u2019s like any childhood event or trauma \u2026 it\u2019s up to us. As the Wallace Shawn character says [Shawn plays an actor in Charlie\u2019s company who functions as an occasional Greek chorus]: it\u2019s going to be horrible, but it\u2019s also going to be over.\u201d A pause. \u201cThough as we know, it keeps going, too.\u201d Baumbach grew up in Brooklyn, the older son of the novelist Jonathan Baumbach (who was married four times) and Georgia Brown, a film critic at the Village Voice (she was Jonathan\u2019s third wife). He was 14 when his parents separated. He remembers it vividly. He went out to watch Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas in Romancing the Stone, having been warned that when he got home there was going to be a family meeting \u2013 a scene he reprises beautifully in the semi- autobiographical The Squid and the Whale, in which Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels play a version of his parents \u2013 and he knew perfectly well what that meant: \u201cI watched the movie with some sense of dread, though I guess it took me out of my head for a while.\u201d He began to cry even before his parents announced their complicated custody arrangements (in the interests of fairness, the two boys would visit their father every Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday, and every other Thursday). Has he seen Romancing the Stone since, or are the glorious adventures of Turner and Douglas in the Colombian jungle forever ruined for him? He laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen it for years. But I liked it at the time. Doesn\u2019t Michael Douglas end up in a boat on Central Park South or something?\u201d Did he always know that he wanted to make films? \u201cI had, at least, the dream. I didn\u2019t know anyone in film, so I didn\u2019t know it was possible. I wanted to do it, and I would say that I wanted to do it, but there was a second voice in my head that said: well, how would that even happen? But I did a lot of plays, and wrote stories, and when VHS happened, I got a camcorder and lugged that around. VHS was amazing. You could watch movies at home, and you didn\u2019t have to wait till Easter to see The Wizard of Oz or whatever.\u201d Did it help that his parents led creative lives? \u201cIt did, and they loved movies, too.\u201d He has said that his father took him to see Truffaut\u2019s The Wild Child when he was just five, or thereabouts. \u201cI was lucky to have them as an example, though it also created its own burdens and challenges. I guess film, for me, was both a kind of inheritance, and a way of doing something different [from them].\u201d Baumbach studied English at Vassar College, where he wrote, directed and acted in plays, but made no movies, largely on account of the fact that its film department had no decent equipment. How, then, did it happen that he came to release his first film, Kicking and Screaming, when he was only 26? He shakes his head. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a good story. Except to say that I\u2019d worked on a script, and I had two good friends who were my housemates in senior year, Jason Blum and Jeremy Kramer, who are both still in films, and the three of us would give it to anyone we could. Again, we had no idea how it worked, and it fell apart many times, even in pre-production. It was so random. The video company involved threatened to pull out at one point, and I had to write the part Eric Stoltz plays at the last minute to get it financed. His character was just slapped on.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI was in LA, and I felt so old, and yet I was so young. I just thought it was all too good to be true.\u201d And in a way, it was. A second film, Mr Jealousy, followed, after which there was a quite long period of silence. \u201cYeah. What happened? It was hard for me. I went through this time after Mr Jealousy: I\u2019d had this early opportunity, and then I was having trouble getting anything made. I was writing pilots, things like that. I was staying busy and making a living, but not the living I wanted. I began to wonder: am I a film-maker? Will I ever make another one? I didn\u2019t think about quitting, but it was really difficult. What I ended up doing was working on myself. I went into therapy. I grew up a bit. I started to understand myself better, and because of that I started to write and think more creatively. Then I wrote The Squid and the Whale. I had a breakthrough. It was a case of: I\u2019m not the film-maker I thought I was.\u201d The other thing that helped was his friendship with the film-maker Wes Anderson, with whom he wrote The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004) and Fantastic Mr Fox (2009). \u201cWe were both friends with [the director] Peter Bogdanovich, and we would hear about each other. We finally met at a John Waters premiere in 1998; afterwards, we ended up at a bar in Soho called Toad Hall. We started talking, and we realised we shared a lot of likes: when we exchanged numbers, we realised we both had the same kind of notebook in our pockets. He was making The Royal Tenenbaums, and just watching how he did it was so inspiring to me. His work ethic, his precision.\u201d Anderson went on to co-produce The Squid and the Whale. \u201cA lot of film-makers are nice,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it can be tough. Directing is lonely. Mike Nichols said a director always needs a buddy, and that\u2019s wise: to have a producing partner, or a writer. Though if you write and direct, obviously you don\u2019t have a writer.\u201d These days, however, he has Gerwig, with whom he wrote two films, Frances Ha and Mistress America. \u201cThe press part is harder, because we\u2019re on different schedules. But in terms of the rest of it, for us, it\u2019s nice.\u201d Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott\u2019s Little Women, starring Meryl Streep and Saoirse Ronan, opens at Christmas. He beams. \u201cOh, it\u2019s great. When you see it, you\u2019ll realise immediately. You\u2019ll think: of course, this is why she did it.\u201d For his own part, he has no idea what he\u2019ll do next. \u201cI was with Adam [Driver] last night, having the conversations we tend to have: how about this? How about that?\u201d All he knows is that he and Driver, who have become close in spite of the 14-year age gap between them, will certainly work together again in the future. \u201cHe\u2019s amazing. He\u2019s always alive as an actor to the particular moment.\u201d Baumbach only wants, he says, to go with what he\u2019s doing right now. \u201cThe whole process is a conversation with my younger self, who so loved movies.\u201d He won\u2019t \u2013 he can\u2019t \u2013 take it for granted. \u201cYou\u2019re at Venice, or somewhere, and something happens, and it\u2019s so exciting, and all you want to do is check in with your 17-year-old self who, had he known what was coming, would have thought it so cool.\u201d Noah\u2019s arc: the best of Baumbach, by Guy Lodge Kicking and Screaming (1995) Aged just 26, Baumbach made his debut with this modestly scaled but spiky ensemble piece following a group of college graduates all struggling to start the next phase in their lives. Made with a script endorsed by Steve Martin, it earned Baumbach a pile of \u201cnames to watch\u201d notices, though his true breakthrough would take another decade. The Squid and the Whale (2005) Now thematically bookended by Marriage Story, this mordantly funny divorce drama starred a peak-form Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney as warring literary spouses and was inspired by Baumbach\u2019s parents\u2019 split. It was the director\u2019s fourth film, but it announced his name to a wider audience, scoring him his only Oscar nomination to date. Margot at the Wedding (2007) Reviews were chilly for Baumbach\u2019s follow-up to the success of The Squid and the Whale, but this piquant study of a successful, narcissistic writer descending on her estranged sister\u2019s Long Island wedding festivities gets too little credit. Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Jason Leigh give exquisite performances and there\u2019s hard humanity under the sour surface. Frances Ha (2012) Baumbach\u2019s collaboration with Greta Gerwig began with the droll LA story Greenberg, but it blossomed in this vibrant, New Wave-styled character study of a young would-be dancer in personal, professional and even residential limbo. Co-written with Gerwig, and shot in gorgeous, grainy black and white, it\u2019s less jaded and more joyful than his previous work. Marriage Story (2019) Fourteen years after making drama from his parents\u2019 divorce, Baumbach gives the same treatment to his own split from Jennifer Jason Leigh, following Adam Driver\u2019s New York theatre director and Scarlett Johansson\u2019s LA-native actor through the travails of a bicoastal separation. Brutally close to the bone and sometimes raucously comic, it\u2019s earned the best reviews of his career.",

      "body": "<h2>\u2018I put myself on peternity leave and we hung out\u2019: <em>Kate Spicer, 49, journalist, and Wolfy the dog, 9, London</em></h2> <p>There were a lot of things that were a bit awry about my life. The main problem was that I went out and didn\u2019t come home. I\u2019d go on these benders that were incredibly destructive to my wellbeing. And then when I was working, I\u2019d never leave the house. I\u2019d just sit in front of the laptop thinking about all the work I had to do, moping, writing, moping again. I felt frozen in time. Unable to move forward.</p> <p>There are some things you don\u2019t question because they\u2019re family lore and in my family it was that you can\u2019t have a dog in London. But when I met my boyfriend and we got a flat together, I realised I really, really wanted a dog.</p> <p>After many failed attempts, we found a man who was getting rid of a lurcher. The night before we met him, I was out and someone offered me drugs. I said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m getting a dog in the morning.\u201d They looked at me like, \u201cSo?\u201d But it felt massive to me. That morning, my boyfriend and I drove to a place near the M25 to meet the man with the lurcher. The dog walked towards us and was a bit sad-looking, really dirty and smelled terrible. But he was still so elegant and funny, too.</p> <p>It was exciting having this other little soul come into our tiny orbit. I put myself on \u201cpeternity leave\u201d and Wolfy, as we called him, and I just hung out for a while. We\u2019d go for lunch together and on lots of walks. He loved it.</p> <p>Obviously he\u2019s simple, he\u2019s an animal, but his presence pulled me out of myself and centred me back to a calm part of myself. I was 45 and had worked as a freelancer in London for 25 years and was pretty hardened. But he softened me and helped me love unconditionally. I now had a reason to come home at night. I still went to parties, but in a less destructive way. Sometimes I\u2019d take him with me and he\u2019d just look at me like, \u201cWhat the fuck? Let\u2019s go home.\u201d And I\u2019d be like, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s been an ongoing thing since then to disentangle from doing things that harm me. And to do things that make my short time on this earth joyful and positive; Wolfy is my daily lesson in how to live that life.</p> <p><em>Kate Spicer\u2019s book Lost Dog: A Love Story is published by Ebury.

She wasn\u2019t like that with anyone else\u2019: Angela with Missy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Telfer/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We got Missy as a kitten and gave her that name because she was quite the diva. Our family immediately loved her, but she didn\u2019t necessarily show that she loved us back. She didn\u2019t like being picked up or cuddled. Everything was on her terms. In April 2013, when she was less than one year old, we were all playing on the floor when she jumped on my chest and I thought, \u201cOoh, that hurt a little.\u201d After that, whenever I was lying down she\u2019d lie on me and paw at this one spot on my right breast. If I moved her paw, she\u2019d put it back in the same place. If I was sitting down, she\u2019d get up on my lap and nudge her head there. She started following me around everywhere. She wasn\u2019t like that with anyone else.</p> <p>It was three months of that behaviour before I admitted it wasn\u2019t going to stop. I knew it sounded crazy to go to the doctor and say, \u201cMy cat keeps bothering me,\u201d but I had some discomfort, too. The doctor found atypical cells and calcification in the same spot Missy had been nudging. It wasn\u2019t full-blown breast cancer, but it had the potential to change, so I had an operation to remove the cells.</p> <p>I felt so grateful to Missy; I wouldn\u2019t have gone to the doctor if it hadn\u2019t been for her. I\u2019d heard of dogs doing that kind of thing, but not cats. When I got home I rewarded her with some Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s prawns \u2013 rather than the Asda ones that she\u2019s used to.</p> <p>As my wound healed she backed off and went back to her aloof self. It was weird for me. I felt like maybe she didn\u2019t love me as much any more. I was back to being treated like everyone else. But I was comforted that there was a reason for her behaviour.</p> <p>One night two years later, she came and lay on my chest in bed. I said to my partner: \u201cDo you think she\u2019s trying to tell me something?\u201d He laughed it off. But the next night was the same. She started following me again. It was really unsettling. I\u2019d got used to her barely bothering to get off the bed. When I went back to the same doctor with no symptoms other than my cat pestering me I had to plead with her to believe me. She sent me to the hospital and I was given the same diagnosis and they did the same operation again. It was the same consultant and team. They were fantastic \u2013 and believed me. Not everyone does, but that\u2019s up to them.</p> <p>Two years later when it all happened a third time, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. There were eight areas of calcification in my breast. I had a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery and they removed the lymph nodes.</p> <p>That was 2017. Thankfully, Missy\u2019s been consistently aloof since then and I\u2019ve been fine. I know it sounds strange but I feel as if she saved my life. She will forever be my hero, whether she likes it or not.</p> <h2>\u2018After I lost everything, he made life worth living\u2019: <em>Ben Coles, 33, unemployed, and Biggie the iguana, </em><em>4, Chippenham, Wiltshire</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7d5e281ae46bf1692d31bff6ce8de74b71b682dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d5e281ae46bf1692d31bff6ce8de74b71b682dc/0_232_5440_3263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Coles and iguana Biggie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If I turn my face, he\u2019ll give me a little lick on the lips\u2019: Ben Coles and Biggie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Pelly/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I first got Biggie, I had a job, a house, a girlfriend. He was six months old and about 18in long. But about six months into having him, I went through a bad spell of mental health. As a result, I lost my job, then my house, broke up with my girlfriend, and was almost declared bankrupt. Everything just toppled on me. I had anxiety and I was very easily irritated. I don\u2019t blame them, but my family and friends eventually became sick of me. It felt like Biggie was the only being not giving me grief and I just felt this closeness to him.</p> <p>But it was a struggle for me to keep hold of him. No landlords wanted to take us in and I was left homeless. People hear \u201ciguana\u201d and they think, \u201cOh God, it\u2019s going to rip everything apart.\u201d I spent three months living on my mum\u2019s sofa, paying friends to look after Biggie. I fell out with my mum for not taking him in. For a period, he lived in Bristol and I went back and forth every day to see him, because obviously all the moving and being apart from each other was stressful for the lizard as well.</p> <p>I\u2019d lost everything in my life, but he was my partner in crime and the only thing I was living for. I can\u2019t imagine how much harder that time would have been without him. Keeping him alive saved my life.</p> <p>Eventually I got a place in Chippenham. He\u2019s grown to four-and-a-half-foot long now. He thinks he\u2019s a cat and just loves attention. When I do the dishes, he comes and sits on my head. If I turn my face, he\u2019ll give me a little lick on the lips. With certain people he\u2019ll climb up their leg and sit and stare at them until they start stroking him. When he outgrew his vivarium, I set out basking areas with UV lights, and now he roams free around the house. I bathe him twice a day because he\u2019s a rainforest lizard. He makes a fuss to get in the tub, but loves it once he\u2019s in. My girlfriend works in an expensive supermarket and Biggie loves their fruit, which is quite a pricey habit. His favourite is Candyfloss grapes. At night, he sits on my chest and I put my dressing gown over us. Luckily, my girlfriend loves him, too.</p> <h2>\u2018Trixie helps me control my obsessive thoughts\u2019: <em>Stephanie Lynch, 25, civil servant, and Trixie the hamster, </em><em>1, Port Talbot, Wales</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d43940a679a69e9821761cc8d733cf2bbe6a0fed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d43940a679a69e9821761cc8d733cf2bbe6a0fed/0_371_5620_3373/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Watching Trixie play gives me such a feeling of joy\u2019: Stephanie with Trixie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Watching Trixie play gives me such a feeling of joy\u2019: Stephanie with Trixie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Pelly/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So often in my life I feel like what I say or what I do is going to have a grave consequence, but with Trixie I don\u2019t feel that way. When I shut the bedroom door to be with her, she\u2019s so present in the room, everything else just goes away.</p> <p>I have OCD which stems from guilt towards a lot of things. As a child, my family had a house fire and one of my little brothers passed away. After that, if I heard a noise in the night, I had to sit up to check everything was OK; if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d feel like there would be another fire. I became obsessed with thinking about accidents. Every 10 minutes I was imagining falling and would have the physical feeling you get just before you fall. It was about me, my boyfriend, anyone around me.</p> <p>But Trixie helped change that. Late last summer, I started medication and got her not long afterwards. Hamsters need a lot of care and having a positive impact on her through feeding, changing her bedding, just making the right choices, really helped me. Watching Trixie play, sniff around, climb all over me, I found myself smiling on my own, which is not something I do. It was such a light feeling of joy. And a break from my thoughts.</p> <p>Our boxroom is her room now. I love changing her cage. I think, \u201cWell, what might she find interesting?\u201d I know her different moods and have learned her favourite treat is watermelon. I still get the obsessive thoughts, but I can choose to let them go and think of Trixie.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t know how much she means to me. Or how I feel. But that doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s something to be said for getting comfort from another being without telling them why you\u2019re upset. Obviously I know hamsters don\u2019t live forever and hate the thought of her dying, but I know I\u2019m giving her the best life possible. And she gives me so much back.</p> <h2>\u2018I felt so isolated, but he helped connect to the world\u2019: <em>Majid Sohrabi</em><em>, 49, and Oxford the dog, 5, Alexandria, </em><em>Dumbertonshire</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b0d5ef0584dc4e363ae59f2fe6c63832e394bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b0d5ef0584dc4e363ae59f2fe6c63832e394bac/0_1212_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I can\u2019t believe how pessimistic I was before I got him.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I put myself on peternity leave and we hung out\u2019: Kate Spicer, 49, journalist, and Wolfy the dog, 9, London There were a lot of things that were a bit awry about my life. The main problem was that I went out and didn\u2019t come home. I\u2019d go on these benders that were incredibly destructive to my wellbeing. And then when I was working, I\u2019d never leave the house. I\u2019d just sit in front of the laptop thinking about all the work I had to do, moping, writing, moping again. I felt frozen in time. Unable to move forward. There are some things you don\u2019t question because they\u2019re family lore and in my family it was that you can\u2019t have a dog in London. But when I met my boyfriend and we got a flat together, I realised I really, really wanted a dog. After many failed attempts, we found a man who was getting rid of a lurcher. The night before we met him, I was out and someone offered me drugs. I said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m getting a dog in the morning.\u201d They looked at me like, \u201cSo?\u201d But it felt massive to me. That morning, my boyfriend and I drove to a place near the M25 to meet the man with the lurcher. The dog walked towards us and was a bit sad-looking, really dirty and smelled terrible. But he was still so elegant and funny, too. It was exciting having this other little soul come into our tiny orbit. I put myself on \u201cpeternity leave\u201d and Wolfy, as we called him, and I just hung out for a while. We\u2019d go for lunch together and on lots of walks. He loved it. Obviously he\u2019s simple, he\u2019s an animal, but his presence pulled me out of myself and centred me back to a calm part of myself. I was 45 and had worked as a freelancer in London for 25 years and was pretty hardened. But he softened me and helped me love unconditionally. I now had a reason to come home at night. I still went to parties, but in a less destructive way. Sometimes I\u2019d take him with me and he\u2019d just look at me like, \u201cWhat the fuck? Let\u2019s go home.\u201d And I\u2019d be like, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d It\u2019s been an ongoing thing since then to disentangle from doing things that harm me. And to do things that make my short time on this earth joyful and positive; Wolfy is my daily lesson in how to live that life. Kate Spicer\u2019s book Lost Dog: A Love Story is published by Ebury. Order it for \u00a314.95 from guardianbookshop.com \u2018My cat alerted me to cancerous cells in my breast\u2019: Angela Tinning, 46, finance manager, and Missy the cat, 7, Newcastle We got Missy as a kitten and gave her that name because she was quite the diva. Our family immediately loved her, but she didn\u2019t necessarily show that she loved us back. She didn\u2019t like being picked up or cuddled. Everything was on her terms. In April 2013, when she was less than one year old, we were all playing on the floor when she jumped on my chest and I thought, \u201cOoh, that hurt a little.\u201d After that, whenever I was lying down she\u2019d lie on me and paw at this one spot on my right breast. If I moved her paw, she\u2019d put it back in the same place. If I was sitting down, she\u2019d get up on my lap and nudge her head there. She started following me around everywhere. She wasn\u2019t like that with anyone else. It was three months of that behaviour before I admitted it wasn\u2019t going to stop. I knew it sounded crazy to go to the doctor and say, \u201cMy cat keeps bothering me,\u201d but I had some discomfort, too. The doctor found atypical cells and calcification in the same spot Missy had been nudging. It wasn\u2019t full-blown breast cancer, but it had the potential to change, so I had an operation to remove the cells. I felt so grateful to Missy; I wouldn\u2019t have gone to the doctor if it hadn\u2019t been for her. I\u2019d heard of dogs doing that kind of thing, but not cats. When I got home I rewarded her with some Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s prawns \u2013 rather than the Asda ones that she\u2019s used to. As my wound healed she backed off and went back to her aloof self. It was weird for me. I felt like maybe she didn\u2019t love me as much any more. I was back to being treated like everyone else. But I was comforted that there was a reason for her behaviour. One night two years later, she came and lay on my chest in bed. I said to my partner: \u201cDo you think she\u2019s trying to tell me something?\u201d He laughed it off. But the next night was the same. She started following me again. It was really unsettling. I\u2019d got used to her barely bothering to get off the bed. When I went back to the same doctor with no symptoms other than my cat pestering me I had to plead with her to believe me. She sent me to the hospital and I was given the same diagnosis and they did the same operation again. It was the same consultant and team. They were fantastic \u2013 and believed me. Not everyone does, but that\u2019s up to them. Two years later when it all happened a third time, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. There were eight areas of calcification in my breast. I had a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery and they removed the lymph nodes. That was 2017. Thankfully, Missy\u2019s been consistently aloof since then and I\u2019ve been fine. I know it sounds strange but I feel as if she saved my life. She will forever be my hero, whether she likes it or not. \u2018After I lost everything, he made life worth living\u2019: Ben Coles, 33, unemployed, and Biggie the iguana, 4, Chippenham, Wiltshire When I first got Biggie, I had a job, a house, a girlfriend. He was six months old and about 18in long. But about six months into having him, I went through a bad spell of mental health. As a result, I lost my job, then my house, broke up with my girlfriend, and was almost declared bankrupt. Everything just toppled on me. I had anxiety and I was very easily irritated. I don\u2019t blame them, but my family and friends eventually became sick of me. It felt like Biggie was the only being not giving me grief and I just felt this closeness to him. But it was a struggle for me to keep hold of him. No landlords wanted to take us in and I was left homeless. People hear \u201ciguana\u201d and they think, \u201cOh God, it\u2019s going to rip everything apart.\u201d I spent three months living on my mum\u2019s sofa, paying friends to look after Biggie. I fell out with my mum for not taking him in. For a period, he lived in Bristol and I went back and forth every day to see him, because obviously all the moving and being apart from each other was stressful for the lizard as well. I\u2019d lost everything in my life, but he was my partner in crime and the only thing I was living for. I can\u2019t imagine how much harder that time would have been without him. Keeping him alive saved my life. Eventually I got a place in Chippenham. He\u2019s grown to four-and-a-half-foot long now. He thinks he\u2019s a cat and just loves attention. When I do the dishes, he comes and sits on my head. If I turn my face, he\u2019ll give me a little lick on the lips. With certain people he\u2019ll climb up their leg and sit and stare at them until they start stroking him. When he outgrew his vivarium, I set out basking areas with UV lights, and now he roams free around the house. I bathe him twice a day because he\u2019s a rainforest lizard. He makes a fuss to get in the tub, but loves it once he\u2019s in. My girlfriend works in an expensive supermarket and Biggie loves their fruit, which is quite a pricey habit. His favourite is Candyfloss grapes. At night, he sits on my chest and I put my dressing gown over us. Luckily, my girlfriend loves him, too. \u2018Trixie helps me control my obsessive thoughts\u2019: Stephanie Lynch, 25, civil servant, and Trixie the hamster, 1, Port Talbot, Wales So often in my life I feel like what I say or what I do is going to have a grave consequence, but with Trixie I don\u2019t feel that way. When I shut the bedroom door to be with her, she\u2019s so present in the room, everything else just goes away. I have OCD which stems from guilt towards a lot of things. As a child, my family had a house fire and one of my little brothers passed away. After that, if I heard a noise in the night, I had to sit up to check everything was OK; if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d feel like there would be another fire. I became obsessed with thinking about accidents. Every 10 minutes I was imagining falling and would have the physical feeling you get just before you fall. It was about me, my boyfriend, anyone around me. But Trixie helped change that. Late last summer, I started medication and got her not long afterwards. Hamsters need a lot of care and having a positive impact on her through feeding, changing her bedding, just making the right choices, really helped me. Watching Trixie play, sniff around, climb all over me, I found myself smiling on my own, which is not something I do. It was such a light feeling of joy. And a break from my thoughts. Our boxroom is her room now. I love changing her cage. I think, \u201cWell, what might she find interesting?\u201d I know her different moods and have learned her favourite treat is watermelon. I still get the obsessive thoughts, but I can choose to let them go and think of Trixie. She doesn\u2019t know how much she means to me. Or how I feel. But that doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s something to be said for getting comfort from another being without telling them why you\u2019re upset. Obviously I know hamsters don\u2019t live forever and hate the thought of her dying, but I know I\u2019m giving her the best life possible. And she gives me so much back. \u2018I felt so isolated, but he helped connect to the world\u2019: Majid Sohrabi, 49, and Oxford the dog, 5, Alexandria, Dumbertonshire The first time I saw Oxford he was a puppy.

      "body": "<p>Rising temperatures across Asia and the Americas have contributed to multiple severe outbreaks of dengue fever globally over the past six months, making 2019 the worst year on record for the disease.</p> <p>In 1970 only nine countries faced severe dengue outbreaks. But the disease, which is spread by mosquitoes that can only survive in warm temperatures, is now seen in more than 100 countries. There are <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue\" title=\"\">thought to be 390 million</a> infections each year.</p> <p>Thais Dos Santos, an expert adviser on the surveillance and control of arboviral diseases for the Pan American Health Organization, said dengue was reaching new areas as temperatures rise.</p> <p>\u201cThe hotter the climate, the better the mosquito is at breeding, but it is now coming up higher and higher to cities like Bogot\u00e1 and Mexico City that are well above sea level, cities traditionally believed to be safe from the <em>Aedes</em> mosquito.\u201d</p> <p>Across Asia the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-scales-up-response-to-worldwide-surge-in-dengue\" title=\"\">scale of outbreaks</a> has been taking communities by surprise.

In Nepal there have been <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nepal-reeling-from-unprecedented-dengue-virus-outbreak\" title=\"\">nearly 14,000 cases of dengue</a> since mid-July.

But Dr Dev Basu Pandey said he was still treating dengue patients on his ward at the Sukrara Tropical and Infectious Diseases hospital in the Nepalese capital. \u201cUsually there would not be dengue still at this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this year it is still warm, even once the sun has set.

The insects thrive in human habitation, laying their eggs in used tyres, flowerpots, tree holes and any water-filled container.</p> <p>As climate change alters monsoon and rain patterns in many countries, this creates the damp and warm conditions that, along with rapid urbanisation, help the <em>Aedes</em> mosquitoes flourish.</p> <p>The Americas also broke records for dengue. More than 2.7 million cases were reported across the region by mid-November, the largest number since records began, and a 13% increase on the total yearly number in 2015, the previous record year.

      "bodyText": "Rising temperatures across Asia and the Americas have contributed to multiple severe outbreaks of dengue fever globally over the past six months, making 2019 the worst year on record for the disease. In 1970 only nine countries faced severe dengue outbreaks. But the disease, which is spread by mosquitoes that can only survive in warm temperatures, is now seen in more than 100 countries. There are thought to be 390 million infections each year. Thais Dos Santos, an expert adviser on the surveillance and control of arboviral diseases for the Pan American Health Organization, said dengue was reaching new areas as temperatures rise. \u201cThe hotter the climate, the better the mosquito is at breeding, but it is now coming up higher and higher to cities like Bogot\u00e1 and Mexico City that are well above sea level, cities traditionally believed to be safe from the Aedes mosquito.\u201d Across Asia the scale of outbreaks has been taking communities by surprise. In Pakistan one city hospital in Rawalpindi admitted more than 2,000 dengue patients in a single weekend in October. Across the country a record-breaking 47,000 people have been infected this year, almost double the previous high of 27,000 in 2011. Other Asian countries, including Bangladesh, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos, also had outbreaks, with a particularly severe situation in the Philippines, where 1,000 people died of the disease, including hundreds of children. Mosquitoes have also brought dengue to places where it has never been seen before, including the hills of Nepal, never warm enough in previous years for the disease to take hold. In Nepal there have been nearly 14,000 cases of dengue since mid-July. The previous record was 2,000 two years ago. The dengue season in Kathmandu is usually short, mild and over by November. But Dr Dev Basu Pandey said he was still treating dengue patients on his ward at the Sukrara Tropical and Infectious Diseases hospital in the Nepalese capital. \u201cUsually there would not be dengue still at this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this year it is still warm, even once the sun has set. We have never seen an outbreak like this; people are afraid.\u201d Average maximum temperatures in Nepal increased between 1971 and 2014 with the overall average annual maximum temperature of the whole country rising by 0.056 degrees Celsius. The study by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology also noted that temperatures increased most in some of the highest altitude parts of the country. The spread of the disease is heavily related to human activity. The insects thrive in human habitation, laying their eggs in used tyres, flowerpots, tree holes and any water-filled container. As climate change alters monsoon and rain patterns in many countries, this creates the damp and warm conditions that, along with rapid urbanisation, help the Aedes mosquitoes flourish. The Americas also broke records for dengue. More than 2.7 million cases were reported across the region by mid-November, the largest number since records began, and a 13% increase on the total yearly number in 2015, the previous record year. Over 2 million of the cases came from Brazil.Dos Santos said there were clear changes in dengue patterns. \u201cDengue is episodic so we would expect to see a larger than normal epidemic every two to five years but this year was unusual. We are seeing a shift in seasonality, seeing outbreaks start earlier. \u201cAnother unusual thing this year was a heavy circulation of the second type, dengue 2, which is well known for causing severe forms of the disease. We saw a lot of severe cases and death this year.\u201dThere is also another way that hotter temperatures help dengue spread. \u201cAfter a mosquito bites an infected person and drinks up the virus in the blood, the virus needs to spend time in the mosquito\u2019s gut before it can be passed on through a bite. As the outside temperature increases ... the time for the virus to survive and be able to be passed on is reduced.\u201d Dos Santos said he wants people to see how rising temperatures and climate change are beginning to harm human health. \u201cWe are detecting a shift to a younger population, most of the cases in Central America were in under-15s. Sadly, most severe cases and deaths were disproportionately affecting children. \u201cWe see children dying but how this is related to the climate is not always made explicit. [We need to do] a better job of connecting these constellation of ways in which the change in climate is affecting us.\u201d Rachel Lowe, of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said the current situation with dengue spreading to new areas was caused by a multitude of factors, including poverty and slum-like living conditions. \u201cThis year\u2019s outbreaks are unprecedented, part of 30 years of a global spread. We have seen dramatic increases in global temperatures and also unplanned urbanisation. There are a combination of factors that lead to dengue, including living conditions and the way people are forced to live without refuse collection.\u201dWhile many vaccine trials are under way, she and her colleagues are looking at preparing for outbreaks using early warning prediction systems. \u201cWe have a UK space agency-funded project to develop early warning in Vietnam and we are working with the Met Office and UNDP to develop seasonal forecast systems in Brazil and Equador. We are trying to improve preparedness so we can estimate six months in advance where you can go and target limited vector control and make sure health facilities know there is an epidemic under way. Researchers from LSHTM and Oxford University produced figures earlier this year to show that if warming continues globally the two main disease-spreading mosquitoes \u2013 Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus \u2013 will significantly expand their range. The models predict that by 2050, 49% of the world\u2019s population will live in places where these species are established if greenhouse gas emissions continue at current rates, and if they are not curbed, even greater areas will be at risk. \u201cIf no action is taken to reduce the current rate at which the climate is warming, pockets of habitat will open up across many urban areas\u201d said Moritz Kraemer, an infectious disease scientist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and the University of Oxford, who co-authored the research. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 December 2019 to correct temperature data for Nepal.

The Blakeney is a stylish, 60-room grand hotel with an award-winning restaurant and a bounty of home comforts. What\u2019s new about the place? All rooms are individually designed and cosy. The restaurant\u2019s daily changing menu reflects the freshness of the day\u2019s catch, and the hotel\u2019s attention to detail. There\u2019s also a decent-size pool and mini gym, if you\u2019re so inclined. Star attractions? Blakeney Point\u2019s grey and common seal colonies are the local heroes and a boat trip from Blakeney or Morston Quay for a peek at them, in their hundreds, is a must-see. Beans Boats\u2019 wisecracking crew have been taking tours around the Blakeney nature reserve for years and there can\u2019t be much they don\u2019t know about the seals and migrating birds. Drive west to Holkham Bay to stroll along the dunes and miles of stunning beach. Room with a view? Yes, definitely! The Lookout on the first floor is a large room with a panoramic window looking out over the estuary, complete with a telescope and binoculars. It\u2019s a wonderful setting in which to watch the wildlife while enjoying an afternoon tea. Where\u2019s good to eat? Try the Moorings in Blakeney High Street, for lunch, tea or supper. And don\u2019t forget to visit\u2026 Sandringham is only a half-hour drive away, and in winter the town of Holt, a few miles to the south, is lit up with magical street lights.

      "bodyText": "In 1960, four young men met in a London cafe and so began Beyond the Fringe and a revolution that would change the face of British culture. One of this satirical gang of four was Jonathan Miller, who looked like a kinaesthetic \u201cAnglepoise lamp\u201d, as it was said, in continual motion and spoke as if ideas gushed from him like water from a bottomless reservoir. Astonishingly profuse, giddyingly versatile and connective, endlessly restless and firing on all synapses, Miller was a neurologist who became \u2013 all at the same time, like a magic trick performed in plain sight \u2013 a comedian, a theatre and opera director, a presenter of a landmark TV series about the body, a public intellectual, a famous feuder and a man who had a bewilderingly eloquent and informed opinion on just about anything. In 1962, a young man arrived in the UK from Australia, and \u2013 irreverently, joyously, hilariously \u2013 set about demolishing the walls between high and low art. The Observer TV columns that made him famous were essays of comic genius that treated all genres with equal seriousness and equal mockery. People who didn\u2019t even own a TV bought the paper to read the high-wire weekly performance. Clive James was a TV critic who was also a TV star, a literary reviewer who was at the same time a poet and novelist, practising what he mocked, thin-skinned about being mocked right back. For decades, the two men were at the heart of British cultural life, both as theoreticians and practitioners. And now, within days of each other, they are both gone. It may be hard for a young person today to understand how astonishingly new, fresh, radical, destabilising and glorious their achievements were then. They burst onto a dreary postwar society of austerity and grim respectability, of strict hierarchies, of Norman Wisdom and wet Sunday afternoons, of knowing one\u2019s place and keeping to it. For both, not keeping to one\u2019s place was the point, overturning the rules was the point, puncturing pomposity, skewering pretension, mocking revered establishments, demolishing old certainties, exuberantly and loudly speaking about things that had previously been whispered or not mentioned at all. The old ways were dying. The world was for the young. Miller once called himself an \u201cinformaliser\u201d; he brought jukeboxes into opera productions and Wittgenstein into standup comedy. He turned his fierce, pliant, democratic intelligence on all manner of subjects: imitating a sat-upon sofa, directing Alice in Wonderland, talking about Shakespeare to schoolchildren, arguing with Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses who came to his door. And James described himself as a \u201cpremature post-modernist\u201d, insisting \u2013 like the US film critic Pauline Kael \u2013 that the creative impulse could flourish in every arena, in gameshows as well as classical music, soap operas as well as classical ones. In his (nearly 900-page long) collection of essays, Cultural Amnesia: Notes in the Margin of My Time, he gives us his maverick A-Z of 20th-century culture that leaps nimbly between figures such as Louis Armstrong, Sigmund Freud, Terry Gilliam, Coco Chanel\u2026 TS Eliot wrote about the music hall, but he didn\u2019t get up on stage.

In the space of a few minutes, he has traipsed up the long gravel drives to speak to a couple of voters pledging to switch from the Conservatives to back him.</p> <p>And yet it is clear that Lee, whose concerns about Brexit drove him to give up a safe Tory seat to fight the Remain cause, is aware that there are frustrating obstacles that could prove critical in his quest to overturn the 18,000 majority of the arch-Brexiter John Redwood. The failure of a bigger pro-Remain pact looms large. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/29/alastair-campbell-says-he-no-longer-wishes-to-be-a-labour-member\" title=\"\">Alastair Campbell</a> was out supporting me yesterday,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty depressed about it.\u201d</p> <p>Lee also admits to some difficulties created by his party\u2019s own policy \u2013 its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-lib-dem-manifesto-missing-the-moderate-opportunity\" title=\"\">commitment to revoke Brexit unilaterally</a> should it win a majority. \u201cIt\u2019s not helped,\u201d he says. \u201cI always say to people, \u2018Look, we\u2019ll revoke if we return <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49826655\" title=\"\">326 MPs</a> to Westminster. If we get 326 Lib Dem MPs, that would be a historic moment\u2019. I think you\u2019ll have noticed it\u2019s been dialled back quite heavily.</p> <p>\u201cMy own view is we should\u2019ve just said we are Remain. We\u2019re for a second referendum, and we\u2019re Remain. That was my own, personal view. I understand where [revoke] came from \u2013 the Liberal Democrat party is very democratic, and it\u2019s what members wanted. But it has involved me having to talk a bit longer to soft Tories, basically.\u201d</p> <p>With less than a fortnight to go until what has been billed as the most important election in a generation, this was the week that two of the main protagonists \u2013 Labour and the Lib Dems \u2013 appeared to change tack.</p> <p>Labour insiders said that the key battle was not now fighting off the Lib Dems in pro-Remain seats but retaining traditional Labour seats in the Midlands and north tempted to vote Tory. For the Lib Dems, talk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/i-can-be-next-pm-says-jo-swinson-as-she-launches-election-campaign\" title=\"\">Jo Swinson becoming PM</a> and revoking Brexit has been replaced by a more defensive plea for Remain voters to prevent a Tory majority by voting tactically for the party in key seats.</p> <p>It was not long ago that the Lib Dems were imbued with confidence that Lee\u2019s seat, Wokingham, was among well over 100 constituencies that it could realistically target thanks to its pro-Remain stance. But last week, a huge <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/11/27/yougov-mrp-conservatives-359-labour-211-snp-43-ld-\" title=\"\">YouGov poll </a>predicted it would win just 13 seats \u2013 representing a net gain of one compared with the last election.</p> <p>In such circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the party has shifted its pitch to voters. When the <em>Observer</em> visited Wokingham last week, concern from Remainers about respecting the referendum result was a running theme. Many in this previously safe Tory seat spoke of their opposition to Jeremy Corbyn. There was also support for Lee, however, suggesting that it remains a tantalising battle. \u201cWe know from our canvass returns that it\u2019s close,\u201d says Lee. \u201cWe know this is a massive challenge, but every time I\u2019ve been out, there have been switchers. Sometimes not so many, other times overwhelming. There has to be something happening.\u201d</p> <p>As for Labour, briefings last week suggested the Lib Dem threat had been overstated, meaning the party would throw its resources behind defending seats in the Midlands and the north that are critical to Boris Johnson\u2019s hopes of a majority.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c64a9657cc72e1ffd104cafccb4ca900f2e2695d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c64a9657cc72e1ffd104cafccb4ca900f2e2695d/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Flint and her party leader Jeremy Corbyn in Conisborough, near Doncaster, after last month\u2019s flooding.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Flint and her party leader Jeremy Corbyn in Conisborough, near Doncaster, after last month\u2019s flooding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking to voters in Don Valley, one of the Labour seats the Tories are predicted to win, it is not hard to detect the danger. Standing on what was once the coal-stocking yard for the Yorkshire Main colliery, now a car park for the discount store Home Bargains, Desmond Hodgetts had no hesitation about who he will be voting for.</p> <p>\u201cBoris. He\u2019s the only one who\u2019s got the balls to sort this out with the EU,\u201d he said. Caroline Flint, the Labour MP for Don Valley for the past 22 years, does \u201ca brilliant job, but who does she work for? I don\u2019t trust Corbyn and his little gang. If Labour had different leaders, I\u2019d be voting for them,\u201d said Hodgetts, a self-employed 57-year-old.</p> <p>The views of a dozen or so voters in Edlington, five miles south of Doncaster, epitomise the challenges facing Labour in next week\u2019s election. Several said they admired Flint, who has been vocal in backing her constituents\u2019 pro-Brexit views in parliament, and who voted in favour of Johnson\u2019s withdrawal deal before the election was called. But only a handful said they had made up their minds to back her. More were undecided, and some were doubtful whether they would vote at all.</p> <p>The campaign was \u201ctough\u201d, said Flint, who is defending a majority of 5,169. \u201cClearly Brexit is dominating. I\u2019d say on every other door in our mining villages, it\u2019s Brexit that comes up. Even Remain voters say we should get on with it.\u201d</p> <p>In former pit villages such as Edlington, voters \u201cdon\u2019t like the Tories, they don\u2019t warm at all to Boris Johnson, but they want Brexit sorted. And the one thing that\u2019s very clear is that they can look me in the eye and know I\u2019ll vote for a deal as soon as possible if re-elected\u201d, said Flint.</p> <p>Neil Thomas said he would vote Conservative in order to get out of the EU. \u201cI don\u2019t like Boris, don\u2019t get me wrong. This election is a tough one for lots of people. My dad was always Labour, but he\u2019s for the Tories now because of all this Brexit. This area used to be rock-solid Labour, but it\u2019s all split now.\u201d</p> <p>Flint said she was not aware of any change of tack from Labour HQ to step up the party\u2019s appeal to pro-Brexit voters following the YouGov poll. But, she added, there was a real risk of people who felt their views had been sidelined not voting at all.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a fortnight to go,\u201d she said on Friday morning. \u201cI\u2019m not taking anything for granted. We\u2019re campaigning hard. But if I lose, we\u2019ll lose 50 Labour seats in the north and Midlands, which would be terrible.\u201d</p> <p>However, senior figures inside Labour believe that talk of changing strategy is not really about the election but the first act in the battle for the post-election narrative about why Labour failed to win. Several Labour figures said they believed it was a move designed to blame pro-Remain figures in the party for defeat, and deflect from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/19/boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-unpopularity-contest-polls\" title=\"\">personal unpopularity of Corbyn</a> or the party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/labour-manifesto-to-slap-11bn-tax-on-oil-and-gas-firms-to-fund-green-plan\" title=\"\">radical policy platform</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not changing tack,\u201d said one insider. \u201cThis is about blaming everyone but themselves for the loss. The fact that we can\u2019t make a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/22/jeremy-corbyn-labour-neutral-second-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">decision on Brexit</a> means the voters can\u2019t trust us on anything else.\u201d</p>",

The failure of a bigger pro-Remain pact looms large. \u201cAlastair Campbell was out supporting me yesterday,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty depressed about it.\u201d Lee also admits to some difficulties created by his party\u2019s own policy \u2013 its commitment to revoke Brexit unilaterally should it win a majority. \u201cIt\u2019s not helped,\u201d he says. \u201cI always say to people, \u2018Look, we\u2019ll revoke if we return 326 MPs to Westminster. If we get 326 Lib Dem MPs, that would be a historic moment\u2019. I think you\u2019ll have noticed it\u2019s been dialled back quite heavily. \u201cMy own view is we should\u2019ve just said we are Remain. We\u2019re for a second referendum, and we\u2019re Remain. That was my own, personal view. I understand where [revoke] came from \u2013 the Liberal Democrat party is very democratic, and it\u2019s what members wanted. But it has involved me having to talk a bit longer to soft Tories, basically.\u201d With less than a fortnight to go until what has been billed as the most important election in a generation, this was the week that two of the main protagonists \u2013 Labour and the Lib Dems \u2013 appeared to change tack. Labour insiders said that the key battle was not now fighting off the Lib Dems in pro-Remain seats but retaining traditional Labour seats in the Midlands and north tempted to vote Tory. For the Lib Dems, talk of Jo Swinson becoming PM and revoking Brexit has been replaced by a more defensive plea for Remain voters to prevent a Tory majority by voting tactically for the party in key seats. It was not long ago that the Lib Dems were imbued with confidence that Lee\u2019s seat, Wokingham, was among well over 100 constituencies that it could realistically target thanks to its pro-Remain stance. But last week, a huge YouGov poll predicted it would win just 13 seats \u2013 representing a net gain of one compared with the last election. In such circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the party has shifted its pitch to voters. When the Observer visited Wokingham last week, concern from Remainers about respecting the referendum result was a running theme. Many in this previously safe Tory seat spoke of their opposition to Jeremy Corbyn. There was also support for Lee, however, suggesting that it remains a tantalising battle. \u201cWe know from our canvass returns that it\u2019s close,\u201d says Lee. \u201cWe know this is a massive challenge, but every time I\u2019ve been out, there have been switchers. Sometimes not so many, other times overwhelming. There has to be something happening.\u201d As for Labour, briefings last week suggested the Lib Dem threat had been overstated, meaning the party would throw its resources behind defending seats in the Midlands and the north that are critical to Boris Johnson\u2019s hopes of a majority. Speaking to voters in Don Valley, one of the Labour seats the Tories are predicted to win, it is not hard to detect the danger. Standing on what was once the coal-stocking yard for the Yorkshire Main colliery, now a car park for the discount store Home Bargains, Desmond Hodgetts had no hesitation about who he will be voting for. \u201cBoris. He\u2019s the only one who\u2019s got the balls to sort this out with the EU,\u201d he said. Caroline Flint, the Labour MP for Don Valley for the past 22 years, does \u201ca brilliant job, but who does she work for? I don\u2019t trust Corbyn and his little gang. If Labour had different leaders, I\u2019d be voting for them,\u201d said Hodgetts, a self-employed 57-year-old. The views of a dozen or so voters in Edlington, five miles south of Doncaster, epitomise the challenges facing Labour in next week\u2019s election. Several said they admired Flint, who has been vocal in backing her constituents\u2019 pro-Brexit views in parliament, and who voted in favour of Johnson\u2019s withdrawal deal before the election was called. But only a handful said they had made up their minds to back her. More were undecided, and some were doubtful whether they would vote at all. The campaign was \u201ctough\u201d, said Flint, who is defending a majority of 5,169. \u201cClearly Brexit is dominating. I\u2019d say on every other door in our mining villages, it\u2019s Brexit that comes up. Even Remain voters say we should get on with it.\u201d In former pit villages such as Edlington, voters \u201cdon\u2019t like the Tories, they don\u2019t warm at all to Boris Johnson, but they want Brexit sorted. And the one thing that\u2019s very clear is that they can look me in the eye and know I\u2019ll vote for a deal as soon as possible if re-elected\u201d, said Flint. Neil Thomas said he would vote Conservative in order to get out of the EU. \u201cI don\u2019t like Boris, don\u2019t get me wrong. This election is a tough one for lots of people. My dad was always Labour, but he\u2019s for the Tories now because of all this Brexit. This area used to be rock-solid Labour, but it\u2019s all split now.\u201d Flint said she was not aware of any change of tack from Labour HQ to step up the party\u2019s appeal to pro-Brexit voters following the YouGov poll. But, she added, there was a real risk of people who felt their views had been sidelined not voting at all. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a fortnight to go,\u201d she said on Friday morning. \u201cI\u2019m not taking anything for granted. We\u2019re campaigning hard. But if I lose, we\u2019ll lose 50 Labour seats in the north and Midlands, which would be terrible.\u201d However, senior figures inside Labour believe that talk of changing strategy is not really about the election but the first act in the battle for the post-election narrative about why Labour failed to win. Several Labour figures said they believed it was a move designed to blame pro-Remain figures in the party for defeat, and deflect from the personal unpopularity of Corbyn or the party\u2019s radical policy platform. \u201cThey are not changing tack,\u201d said one insider. \u201cThis is about blaming everyone but themselves for the loss. The fact that we can\u2019t make a decision on Brexit means the voters can\u2019t trust us on anything else.\u201d",

Homeless people die young and that won\u2019t stop until there is investment in support to help end the revolving door of homelessness.\u201d Official figures show that at least 726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018 \u2013 a 22% increase on the previous year and the largest rise since records began in 2013. Last Thursday councils conducted the annual rough sleeping count, which provides a snapshot of the number of people on the streets on a specific night. John Clifton, a Salvation Army captain, who has helped run its shelter in Ilford, in the London borough of Redbridge, since 2011, said he had seen a large rise in the number of people needing its help. \u201cIn 2011, the count revealed that there were 18 homeless people in Redbridge. In 2017, it was 65 people which put us 11th in the country. We would have been in the top 10 except that in the months before the count we had four people die.\u201d In the winter of 2016-17, the most recent figures available for a specific period, 222 homeless people died and there are concerns a similar number may be at risk this winter as temperatures begin to drop. \u201cWe know that while people won\u2019t necessarily be dying of hypothermia, any extreme weather conditions exacerbate existing health problems and makes those underlying problems like mental health or addiction more difficult to cope with,\u201d Clifton said. Falling temperatures mean charities and local authorities will open emergency night shelters, but councils\u2019 different criteria for opening the shelters leads to a postcode lottery. The Salvation Army, which has more than 80 shelters in the UK and Ireland, cited a typical example of one man it helped. \u201cDaniel\u201d, 42, had been homeless for six months after losing his job following a workplace injury. He suffered a stroke and repeated, worsening seizures, but received no compensation from his employers. He then resorted to alcohol before dying from an overdose. Clifton said that alongside British residents, a small number of whom were women, the Ilford shelter helped eastern European and Punjabi men. \u201cWe see a high proportion of people who can\u2019t access state benefits and it makes it difficult for them to move on. About half of the people sleeping on the streets in London have no recourse to public funds.\u201d The Salvation Army said that in addition to more supported housing, and mental health and addiction treatment, the government needed to ensure local authorities were properly funded to provide support for homelessness. It also called for local housing allowance to be increased so people on benefits and low incomes could afford to rent in the private sector.",

Clive was soon to publish a short book about Philip Larkin. He was pleased with it, and wanted to tell people about it. But he was also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/nov/27/clive-james-obituary\" title=\"\">too ill, by this point, to see a stranger</a>. Would I come? It would mean so much to him. I told her that I would.</p> <p>I want to be clear. It is Claerwen who was, and is, my friend, not Clive. But still, he was a big and beloved figure in my life, and not only because she and I could spend hours at a time talking about our fathers in particular, and men in general. When I first met him, I was 25 and miserably toiling as a trainee in a Fleet Street newsroom. I knew no one, and nothing, and I was very shy, and thanks to these things \u2013 and the fact that he was a genius \u2013 I was a bit intimidated by him at first. Nevertheless, in those early years, he influenced me in all sorts of small but vital ways. I have a strong memory of an afternoon some time in about 1998. Claerwen and I walked into a room to find Clive listening to Joan Sutherland singing Bellini\u2019s opera <em>Norma</em>. He was in a state that seemed to me to be close to sexual ecstasy: legs apart, head thrown back, a look of pure bliss on his face. I knew nothing of opera then, but as he translated her words for us \u2013 he sprang out of his chair to do this \u2013 I thought to myself: I\u2019ll have what he\u2019s having, thanks. That recording of <em>Norma </em>was the first opera I ever owned on CD, bought that very week. Clive\u2019s enthusiasm, as bright and as powerful as a Klieg light, could make you want to read, listen to, watch or look at almost anything.</p> <p>He was \u2013 this has already been said \u2013 very, very clever and very, very funny; he had a way of making you see that something could be both ridiculous <em>and</em> magnificent, and ever since I first learned this from him, I\u2019ve always borne it in mind. He had, too, a sybaritic side that I adored. He could squeeze such pleasure from things. I\u2019ve never seen anyone drink a bottle of Jacob\u2019s Creek with so much enjoyment as him; it might as well have been Ch\u00e2teau Lafite in his glass. I thought of him, always, as deeply generous.</p> <p>He noticed you, and what you were up to. Whenever, in later years, he was trying to get me to come to one of his book launches \u2013 I didn\u2019t need much persuading \u2013 he would send me such sweetly beseeching emails. His \u201cdazzlement division\u201d needed me, he would insist. A certain kind of flirtation, like a certain kind of teasing, is a form of kindness, and for all that I did not take these messages too seriously (he was like this with everyone), that was how I received them: as kindnesses.</p> <p>What I loved most of all, though, was to see him make Claerwen laugh.

It was heart-stirring to see, an almost numinous thing, though I knew he didn\u2019t believe in God.</p> <p>Larkin had always been a bond between him, Claerwen and me: we just think he is the Man. The book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/05/clive-james-books-overrated-all-magic-realism\" title=\"\">Somewhere Becoming Rain</a></em> is a gathering together of everything Clive ever wrote about Larkin.

It was the cold winter of 1964. My landlord, a young publisher, said that if I really wanted to catch up with modern English poetry, I should read Philip Larkin. So I read <em>The Less Deceived</em>. Although I like to think that I brought a certain receptivity to the party \u2013 I was his ideal reader \u2013 I was knocked out straight away.</p> <p><strong>How did he make you feel?</strong></p> <p>First of all, the spoken rhythms were so wonderful. I still think he\u2019s the tops in that way. Second, I knew exactly what the poems meant \u2013 and that\u2019s what staggers me, still, about him. There can\u2019t be many poets in any language who communicate with their readers on such a basic level. I went quietly mad for him.</p> <p>I\u2019d just arrived from Australia, and I wanted to tell him these things, so I wrote to him. I don\u2019t know what drove me to be so crazy as to think he would have time to read a letter from me, let alone to answer it, which he did. Jesus Christ. It [my fandom] was akin to love. But [if you\u2019re the poet] you don\u2019t want too many lovers turning up.</p> <p><strong>By the time his </strong><strong>last collection, </strong><em><strong>High Windows</strong></em><strong>, was published in 1974</strong><strong>, you were in a position to review it. Was that a big deal for you?</strong></p> <p>Yes. The feeling was: this is history, and it\u2019s happening to me. It\u2019s an unbeatable thing, writing about art. It\u2019s heaven.</p> <p><strong>Did it sadden you, what happened to Larkin\u2019s reputation in the period after his letters came out in 1992, and his biography the following year? [Larkin stood accused of racism and bad behaviour to women.]</strong></p> <p>Yes. I could talk about this for ever, which is a bad sign. There were faculty members here in Cambridge saying we shouldn\u2019t read Larkin. What the fuck does that mean? Who else are you recommending we don\u2019t read?</p> <p>My reaction was, and is, people shouldn\u2019t do this. It\u2019s scary. If you are sensitive to language at all, I can\u2019t see how you can\u2019t admire him on some level. The connection between poetry and morality somehow got firmly established in the English university system through [the critic] F R Leavis; poetry came to have to do with virtue.</p> <p>Personally, I\u2019ve always thought that English literary history suffers from its shortage of villains. It needs more bastards in the [John Wilmot, Earl of] Rochester mould. But that said, while Larkin shouldn\u2019t have said those things, he was [outwardly] the model of a gentleman. It\u2019s impossible to imagine him being rude, or even sharp to someone.</p> <p>I think there are various big and obvious reasons why some people wanted to diminish him. One would be his enviable reputation. Another would be the fact that he just didn\u2019t cooperate. He stayed in Hull. London literary life wasn\u2019t for him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/dec/01/clive-james-appreciation-by-john-naughton\">\u2018Clive James would have been a national treasure if only he\u2019d taken himself more seriously\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>That life was for you, though, wasn\u2019t it?</strong></p> <p>Ha, yes. I enjoyed it, the whole business. The argy-bargy. The tangle. My rivals, even.</p> <p><strong>And Larkin\u2019s poems sail on, don\u2019t they?</strong></p> <p>Yes, and that\u2019s the loudest thing to say. Though it could have been a near-run thing, they won through.</p> <p><strong>If we were on a desert island, what Larkin poems would we want?</strong></p> <p>First of all, I\u2019d be trying to attract your attention. So it would be the romantic ones. But \u2026 we\u2019re on a desert island! <em>I\u2019d already have your attention.</em> </p> <p>No, there are so many. I\u2019d have The Whitsun Weddings, Aubade, Church Going, Mr Bleaney, Dockery and Son, To the Sea, An Arundel Tomb, At Grass \u2013 it\u2019s fabulous \u2013 Next, Please. His range of evocation is unmatched since metaphysical times, and he has \u2013 people forget this \u2013 such a feeling for the countryside, puttering along in his very unpowerful car.</p> <p><strong>What about death? Larkin is preoccupied with it, and I wonder what you feel about that, now.</strong></p> <p>My family was marked by tragedy [James\u2019s father, a prisoner of war in Japan, was later killed when a plane bringing POWs home crashed in Manila Bay]. But I, personally, have been marked by all the blessings. I\u2019m giving thanks for life now, which isn\u2019t much like despair, is it?</p> <p>But Larkin was different. He knew it would end in silence, and he was afraid of the silence. He didn\u2019t like the idea of not being here. I\u2019m not like that \u2013 and my death might come as a relief to quite a few people. I\u2019d rather like it not to hurt, that\u2019s all.</p> <p><strong>Will you write another book?</strong></p> <p>Suppose I did another volume of memoirs\u2026</p> <p><strong>Would you like to?</strong></p> <p>Yes, but I don\u2019t think I have the energy. I\u2019ve been hit in the face by a cricket bat at 1,000 miles an hour. I think the last round-up is here. But that\u2019s OK. It would be bad manners to complain. I\u2019ve had a lucky life, and I\u2019m grateful for it.</p>",

I think there are various big and obvious reasons why some people wanted to diminish him. One would be his enviable reputation. Another would be the fact that he just didn\u2019t cooperate. He stayed in Hull. London literary life wasn\u2019t for him. That life was for you, though, wasn\u2019t it? Ha, yes. I enjoyed it, the whole business. The argy-bargy. The tangle. My rivals, even. And Larkin\u2019s poems sail on, don\u2019t they? Yes, and that\u2019s the loudest thing to say. Though it could have been a near-run thing, they won through. If we were on a desert island, what Larkin poems would we want? First of all, I\u2019d be trying to attract your attention. So it would be the romantic ones. But \u2026 we\u2019re on a desert island! I\u2019d already have your attention. No, there are so many. I\u2019d have The Whitsun Weddings, Aubade, Church Going, Mr Bleaney, Dockery and Son, To the Sea, An Arundel Tomb, At Grass \u2013 it\u2019s fabulous \u2013 Next, Please. His range of evocation is unmatched since metaphysical times, and he has \u2013 people forget this \u2013 such a feeling for the countryside, puttering along in his very unpowerful car. What about death? Larkin is preoccupied with it, and I wonder what you feel about that, now. My family was marked by tragedy [James\u2019s father, a prisoner of war in Japan, was later killed when a plane bringing POWs home crashed in Manila Bay]. But I, personally, have been marked by all the blessings. I\u2019m giving thanks for life now, which isn\u2019t much like despair, is it? But Larkin was different. He knew it would end in silence, and he was afraid of the silence. He didn\u2019t like the idea of not being here. I\u2019m not like that \u2013 and my death might come as a relief to quite a few people. I\u2019d rather like it not to hurt, that\u2019s all. Will you write another book? Suppose I did another volume of memoirs\u2026 Would you like to? Yes, but I don\u2019t think I have the energy. I\u2019ve been hit in the face by a cricket bat at 1,000 miles an hour. I think the last round-up is here. But that\u2019s OK. It would be bad manners to complain. I\u2019ve had a lucky life, and I\u2019m grateful for it.",

It was just people who had time on their hands \u2013 and I had a lot of time on my hands. So I made posters for proposed exhibitions relating to popular music and pop culture. There\u2019s a David Bowie study day at the ICA, a Joy Division exhibition, a Shaun Ryder exhibition.</p> <p><strong>So these were imagined exhibitions you\u2019d like to see?</strong><br>Yeah, exactly. Morrissey lyrics at the British Museum, things like that. I did about eight or nine and they were just sort of funny, but also it was me suggesting that maybe in the future, these people will be taken seriously and will have museum shows because of their contribution to culture or art or whatever.

People with all different kinds of views and not just about Brexit: a lot of religious people there preaching, conspiracy theorists, a lot of antisemitism, carnivalesque theatrical displays that people were putting on about their ideas, with sound and dressing-up.

Do you think it\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve done?</strong><br>Actually, no. It\u2019s something I\u2019m very proud of, I\u2019m glad I did it. I can\u2019t believe I was allowed to do it, to be honest. But I don\u2019t think of things being \u201cbest\u201d and I\u2019ve done other things I\u2019m very, very happy about as well. Things that are probably less known, even that film about rave.</p> <p><strong>You mean </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7p5hFZz3xE\" title=\"\">Everybody in the Place</a></strong></em><strong>, which connects acid house to the political landscape of the 1980s, </strong><strong>which was shown on BBC4 recently. Why does that stand out?</strong><br>At the time I wasn\u2019t sure whether it was going to be any good, even when I did it. Everyone of a certain age is almost an expert on that subject, because they lived through those years and they did all those things that are in the film. And I was very happy with the response, but I saw it as a huge risk because most people knew more than I did about it.</p> <p><strong>What, culturally, have you enjoyed recently?</strong><br>I went to see <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkD78qRf3gQ\" title=\"\">Tommy</a></em> the other day, because it\u2019s been rereleased.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Deller makes films, stages historical reenactments and once organised a life-drawing class with a nude Iggy Pop \u2013 any kind of art, really, that doesn\u2019t involve him painting, drawing or making sculpture. His work isn\u2019t often found in galleries, but he currently has a selection of silk-screen prints, made when he was starting out in the mid-1990s, at the Lethaby Gallery, University of the Arts London, part of a show of Turner prize-nominated former UAL students. He is also showing a new film at the Hannah Barry Gallery in south London called Putin\u2019s Happy, which consists of interviews he conducted mainly with pro-Brexit campaigners in Parliament Square earlier this year. Deller is 53 and won the Turner prize in 2004. You wanted to be photographed for this article in a bicycle helmet. Why? Because it\u2019s impossible to look good in one. I cycle around a lot and I suppose if you were to see me in London you\u2019d probably see me wearing a bike helmet, so it\u2019s a realistic depiction of me as a human being. And I just thought it was right not to be too vain. Tell us about the silk screens you are showing as part of Counter Acts, a new exhibition at the University of the Arts London. It was about 1994, 1995 and they did these courses at the London College of Printing for people who wanted to learn how to use the silk-screen beds and other printing techniques. It was just people who had time on their hands \u2013 and I had a lot of time on my hands. So I made posters for proposed exhibitions relating to popular music and pop culture. There\u2019s a David Bowie study day at the ICA, a Joy Division exhibition, a Shaun Ryder exhibition. So these were imagined exhibitions you\u2019d like to see? Yeah, exactly. Morrissey lyrics at the British Museum, things like that. I did about eight or nine and they were just sort of funny, but also it was me suggesting that maybe in the future, these people will be taken seriously and will have museum shows because of their contribution to culture or art or whatever. It was just a thought really. You spent a lot of time in Parliament Square between January and March for Putin\u2019s Happy. Were you surprised by what the protesters were saying? I was shocked actually the first time I went. I couldn\u2019t believe I was experiencing this sort of chaos in Britain. People with all different kinds of views and not just about Brexit: a lot of religious people there preaching, conspiracy theorists, a lot of antisemitism, carnivalesque theatrical displays that people were putting on about their ideas, with sound and dressing-up. It felt like something from Hogarth\u2019s Britain. Before the 2017 election you were responsible for the \u201cStrong and stable my arse\u201d poster campaign. Do you plan any interventions this time around? I\u2019d love to but I just haven\u2019t had any decent ideas. Maybe I\u2019ve been ground down by the whole process, the appalling spectacle. I did think of something around this \u201coven ready\u201d saying that Boris Johnson keeps going on about. Maybe a food-poisoning metaphor, but I don\u2019t know how that would translate into a poster. You were at school with Nigel Farage at Dulwich college, a private school in south London. Yeah, he was two years above me. Do you remember him at all? We had combined cadet force and I\u2019m sure I remember him being very noisy, wearing an army uniform, running, shouting at people. It was a very old-fashioned school; it was run on the lines that the British empire was still a going concern. And therefore you were part of this incredible project, you\u2019re the elite of the greatest country in the world. You were literally taught exceptionalism, which is very dangerous really, and I think he just swallowed what we were told by the teachers about how special we were and how special Britain was. Your 2001 work Battle of Orgreave, which recreated the violent confrontation between striking miners and police in South Yorkshire in 1984, was recently rated by the Guardian as the second best piece of art since 2000. Do you think it\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve done? Actually, no. It\u2019s something I\u2019m very proud of, I\u2019m glad I did it. I can\u2019t believe I was allowed to do it, to be honest. But I don\u2019t think of things being \u201cbest\u201d and I\u2019ve done other things I\u2019m very, very happy about as well. Things that are probably less known, even that film about rave. You mean Everybody in the Place, which connects acid house to the political landscape of the 1980s, which was shown on BBC4 recently. Why does that stand out? At the time I wasn\u2019t sure whether it was going to be any good, even when I did it. Everyone of a certain age is almost an expert on that subject, because they lived through those years and they did all those things that are in the film. And I was very happy with the response, but I saw it as a huge risk because most people knew more than I did about it. What, culturally, have you enjoyed recently? I went to see Tommy the other day, because it\u2019s been rereleased. The most intense artistic experience I\u2019ve ever had as a person was seeing that film when I was about 13. It just absolutely rearranged my brain. It\u2019s almost been the inspiration for everything I\u2019ve done since. Ken Russell is absolutely one of the greatest British artists. So I hadn\u2019t seen it since I was 13 and I watched it on Friday night and just drank it in. Counter Acts is at the Lethaby Gallery, UAL, until 22 January. Putin\u2019s Happy is at the Hannah Barry Gallery until 14 December",

      "body": "<p>You don\u2019t have to be a masochist to be a Liberal Democrat, but it helps. If they are having a painful campaign, at least it is a torture that they are accustomed to. The Lib Dems have not had a successful campaign since 2010, when Cleggmania briefly infected parts of the nation before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/31/nick-clegg-richard-reeves-cleggmania-election-2015\" title=\"\">turning into Cleggphobia</a> soon after they went into coalition with the Conservatives.</p> <p>They got slaughtered in 2015, in part because the Tories ruthlessly cannibalised the support of their former coalition partners. They did even worse in 2017 when anything they had to say was drowned out by questions about Tim Farron\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/14/tim-farron-resigns-liberal-democrats-fresh-face-struggled-with-questions-over-his-christianity\" title=\"\">attitudes towards gay sex</a>. Come to think of it, even the 2010 election was not really that successful. They actually shed a few seats. A share of power only became available because the Tories came up short of a majority.</p> <p>This time around was going to be different. At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberal-democrat-conference-2019\" title=\"\">their party conference</a> back in September, there was breathless, intoxicated talk among Lib Dems that the party could win as many as 100 seats.

The Lib Dems have not had a successful campaign since 2010, when Cleggmania briefly infected parts of the nation before turning into Cleggphobia soon after they went into coalition with the Conservatives. They got slaughtered in 2015, in part because the Tories ruthlessly cannibalised the support of their former coalition partners. They did even worse in 2017 when anything they had to say was drowned out by questions about Tim Farron\u2019s attitudes towards gay sex. Come to think of it, even the 2010 election was not really that successful. They actually shed a few seats. A share of power only became available because the Tories came up short of a majority. This time around was going to be different. At their party conference back in September, there was breathless, intoxicated talk among Lib Dems that the party could win as many as 100 seats. The context did seem promising for a third-party breakthrough. There is a large segment of the electorate that is as repelled by Corbyn Labour as it is appalled by the Johnsonified Tories. The Lib Dems have attracted a stream of defectors, including people of above average political talent and flair, from both the red tribe and the blue.

      "body": "<p>Thanks to her soldier father\u2019s postings, Annie Chapman, who was born in about 1841, lived as a girl both in the better parts of London and in Windsor, close to the king and queen. But even so, life for her family was a struggle. Her father\u2019s wage was paltry. In 1854, her parents and their six children were living in two rented rooms in Knightsbridge when scarlet fever and typhus broke out. In six weeks, these diseases would claim the lives of four of her siblings.</p> <p>Annie was destined, like many girls of her class, to go into service as a housemaid. Only when she married her mother\u2019s lodger, a coachman, did there come the promise of a better life. John Chapman (they shared a surname) was soon hired by a wealthy industrialist, the owner of a French-style chateau so grand it was let to the royal family for Ascot. With this job came a miracle in the form of a house. It had a kitchen, scullery, larder and three bedrooms, and it stood far from the stinking air of London, in open parkland.</p> <p>Annie, though, had a secret. She was a drinker, and for this she would pay a terrible price. Four of her eight babies lived for only days or weeks; a fifth was born with the symptoms of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/30/study-suggests-rate-of-foetal-alcohol-syndrome-disorder-higher-than-thought\" title=\"\">foetal alcohol syndrome;</a> a sixth was paralysed. When her eldest daughter, Emily, died of scarlet fever, just as Annie\u2019s siblings had, her addiction took over. Following an unsuccessful spell in a sanatorium, in 1884 she was cast out by her husband; having long teetered on the edge of a precipice, she now toppled over it.</p> <p>Returning to London, she found herself homeless.

      "bodyText": "Thanks to her soldier father\u2019s postings, Annie Chapman, who was born in about 1841, lived as a girl both in the better parts of London and in Windsor, close to the king and queen. But even so, life for her family was a struggle. Her father\u2019s wage was paltry. In 1854, her parents and their six children were living in two rented rooms in Knightsbridge when scarlet fever and typhus broke out. In six weeks, these diseases would claim the lives of four of her siblings. Annie was destined, like many girls of her class, to go into service as a housemaid. Only when she married her mother\u2019s lodger, a coachman, did there come the promise of a better life. John Chapman (they shared a surname) was soon hired by a wealthy industrialist, the owner of a French-style chateau so grand it was let to the royal family for Ascot. With this job came a miracle in the form of a house. It had a kitchen, scullery, larder and three bedrooms, and it stood far from the stinking air of London, in open parkland. Annie, though, had a secret. She was a drinker, and for this she would pay a terrible price. Four of her eight babies lived for only days or weeks; a fifth was born with the symptoms of foetal alcohol syndrome; a sixth was paralysed. When her eldest daughter, Emily, died of scarlet fever, just as Annie\u2019s siblings had, her addiction took over. Following an unsuccessful spell in a sanatorium, in 1884 she was cast out by her husband; having long teetered on the edge of a precipice, she now toppled over it. Returning to London, she found herself homeless. Sometimes, she was protected by male companions: fellow drinkers with whom she could share a room in a dosshouse. Sometimes, she would stay for a night in the casual ward of a workhouse, picking oakum in exchange for a bed. And sometimes, she would sleep on the street. It was on the street that she died in 1888: the second \u201ccanonical\u201d victim of Jack the Ripper. An inventory of her possessions at the time of her death comprised just 13 items: in addition to her clothes and boots, she had about her person only a scrap of muslin, a comb and an envelope containing two pills. Annie\u2019s short and pitiable life is reconstructed in The Five, Hallie Rubenhold\u2019s devastatingly scrupulous account of the five women who were murdered in Whitechapel in 1888 \u2013 a work that last month won the \u00a350,000 Baillie Gifford prize. Critics often describe books as \u201clong overdue\u201d, but few histories have arrived as late in the day as this one: you could fill a library with titles, serious and spurious, dedicated to so-called Ripperology, yet not one of them would cover this territory.

The news is that over the last 20 years per capita EU incomes have grown by 25% while the US\u2019s have grown 21%, with the US growth rate decelerating while Europe\u2019s has held steady \u2013 indeed accelerating in parts of Europe. What is going on?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/boris-johnson-infatuation-with-donald-trump-will-lead-to-workers-rights-being-ripped-up-tuc\">Johnson's infatuation with Trump could 'rip up workers' rights', warns TUC</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Philippon\u2019s answer is simple. The US economy is becoming increasingly harmed by ever less competition, with fewer and fewer companies dominating sector after sector \u2013 from airlines to mobile phones. Market power is the most important concept in economics, he says. When firms dominate a sector, they invest and innovate less, they peg or raise prices, and they make super-normal profits by just existing (what economists call \u201ceconomic rent\u201d). So it is that mobile phone bills in the US are on average $100 a month, twice that of France and Germany, with the same story in broadband. Profits per passenger airline mile in the US are twice those in Europe. US healthcare is impossibly expensive, with drug companies fixing prices twice as high or even higher than those in Europe; health spending is 18% of GDP. Google, Amazon and Facebook have been allowed to become supermonopolies, buying up smaller challengers with no obstruction.</p> \n<p>This monopolising process gums up everything. Investment in the US has been falling for 20 years. Because prices stay high, wages buy less, so workers\u2019 lifestyles, unless they borrow, get squeezed in real terms while those at the top get paid ever more with impunity. Inequality escalates to unsupportable levels. Even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/23/why-is-life-expectancy-falling\" title=\"\">life expectancy</a> is now falling across the US.</p> \n<p>But why has this happened now? Philippon has a deadly answer. A US political campaign costs 50 times more than one in Europe in terms of money spent for every vote cast. But this doesn\u2019t just distort the political process. It is the chief cause of the US economic crisis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f84407a7-9a31-4796-8c96-e2975da57cb9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-sVBM3Qym0Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Corporations want a return on their money, and the payback is protection from any kind of regulation, investigation or anti-monopoly policy that might strike at their ever-growing market power. Boeing, for example, ensured \u2013 as one of the US\u2019s biggest lobbyists \u2013 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/07/boeing-737-max-regulation-corporate-america\" title=\"\">regulation was friendly</a> to its plans to shoehorn heavier engines on to a plane not designed for them \u2013 the fatal shortcut behind the two crashes of the 737 Max 8. Philippon shows this is systemic; how both at federal and state level ever higher campaign donations are correlated with ever fewer actions against monopoly, price fixing and bad corporate behaviour.</p> \n<p>In Europe, the reverse is true. It is much harder for companies to buy friendly regulators. The EU\u2019s competition authorities are much more genuinely politically independent than those in the US \u2013 witness the extraordinary fines levied on Google or the refusal this February to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/06/eu-blocks-plan-for-alstom-siemens-rail-merger.html\" title=\"\">allow Siemens to merge</a> with the French giant Alstom.

The 50-year-old Australian academic had spent long periods held in the dark, in tiny, windowless cells at unknown locations after he was abducted at gunpoint outside Kabul\u2019s American University, with American Kevin King, in August 2016. His release on 20 November followed six previous unsuccessful attempts by US Special Forces to free him, and months of fraught and unpredictable negotiations, led by US officials, with the terror network.

Even once negotiated, the deal was problematic, with a number of false starts and last-minute postponements, before it finally went ahead, with the Taliban prisoners flown to Qatar. Thanking those involved in his release, including the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the US president, Donald Trump, Weeks said he had been profoundly changed by the experience. \u201cThe time that I spent as a hostage with the Taliban has had a profound and unimaginable effect on me,\u201d he said. Visibly emotional, he said: \u201cAt times I felt as if my death was imminent and that I would never return to see those that I love again but by the will of God I am here, I am alive and I am safe and I am free. There is nothing else in the world that I need.\u201d Despite the gravity of what he endured, Weeks said he never lost hope. \u201cI had hope the whole time. I knew that I would leave that place eventually,\u201d he said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Weeks, from Wagga Wagga, arrived back in Australia on Thursday night after being transferred from a US military base in Germany, where he underwent medical checks. King, the American held hostage alongside him, is still undergoing treatment. Weeks said he felt \u201cgreat joy\u201d that peace talks between the US and Afghan governments and the Taliban had recommenced. \u201cI pray that they will be successful, and that they may enable the return of stability and security to the country of Afghanistan, and the region.\u201d He appealed for privacy for his family, saying the ordeal had especially taken a toll on his father. He added that he hopes to return to academic study in the future but will take a well-deserved holiday first. The experience has left him feeling \u201cstronger\u201d, with a belief that he can get through anything. \u201cIt\u2019s given me a great sense of hope and a great sense of confidence,\u201d he said. Alyssa Carter said the emotional family reunion after almost 1,200 days was \u201cincredible\u201d, while Jo Carter said what her brother had been through was \u201cunimaginable\u201d.",

Richard Spencer, the secretary of the navy fired last week after clashing with the president over war crimes cases, wrote in the Washington Post that it was \u201ca reminder that the president has very little understanding of what it means to be in the military, to fight ethically or to be governed by a uniform set of rules and practices\u201d. It is a far cry from the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency, when he surrounded himself with military brass and boasted about \u201chis generals\u201d. One by one those grand martial figures have left the administration, to be lampooned by their commander-in-chief on their way out the door as \u201cfailed generals\u201d who were \u201cnot tough enough\u201d and \u201coverrated\u201d. More senior officers are reported to be considering resignation, if the president continues to meddle in what they see as the preserve of the military. But Trump is unlikely to stop. The president has held up war crimes defendants as \u201cwarriors\u201d, betrayed by their politically correct superiors. \u201cWe train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!\u201d he complained in a tweet. \u201cThat represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the American warrior ethic,\u201d said Rachel VanLandingham, a retired air force lieutenant colonel and a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles. \u201cA true warrior is one who who exercises restraint and it requires moral courage to exercise restraint.\u201d But Trump\u2019s ideal is encouraged by the pundits he watches on Fox News. He has granted pardons in similar cases earlier in the year, and he clearly believes it fires up his base. The Daily Beast reported he was planning to hit the campaign trail with the three soldiers he recently absolved of war crimes charges. The trio includes the former army lieutenant Clint Lorance, sentenced to 19 years in prison for murder after ordering his men to open fire on three unarmed Afghan men riding past on a motorcycle, killing two of them. And the Green Beret major Matthew Golsteyn, who was facing murder charges after admitting to CIA interviewers that he had killed an unarmed detainee, a suspected bomb-maker, and burned the corpse while serving in Afghanistan in 2010. Trump pardoned both two weeks ago. He also intervened repeatedly in the case of the Navy Seal chief Edward Gallagher, who had been acquitted of the murder of an unarmed detainee, but demoted after being found guilty of posing for a \u201ctrophy\u201d photograph with the corpse. Trump went on Twitter to insist Gallagher keep his trident pin, the celebrated badge of the elite unit, in defiance of a Navy Seal review board. The defendant\u2019s lawyers had found a way of working around the military justice system by getting their cases a sympathetic hearing on Fox, knowing it has an avid viewer in the White House. Their cases were championed in particular by Pete Hegseth, a weekend chat show host on Fox &amp; Friends who is a former reserve military officer, with a dedicated following in the ranks of the armed forces. Hegseth has been scathing over the senior officers who criticize Trump. Gallagher appeared on Hegseth\u2019s show last Sunday, and shocked the military hierarchy by trashing his superiors while still on active duty. He accused Spencer of meddling and the navy special war commander of insubordination for resisting Trump\u2019s interference in military justice. \u201cThere will be subset of the military who will see this as his way of taking on the system, and protecting this guy,\u201d said Katrina Mulligan, who served in the Obama administration\u2019s national security council and justice department and is now managing director for national security and international policy at the Center for American Progress. \u201cMost people in the military and other national security institutions will find it deeply upsetting. You don\u2019t grow up in military service without a healthy respect for the way military justice operates,\u201d she added. The war crimes meddling is just one point of friction between the commander-in-chief and the military. Trump \u2013 who never served in the military, and avoided Vietnam by claiming to have \u201cbone spurs\u201d \u2013 has claimed greater expertise than his commanders, and has fired off orders on Twitter with little or no consultation. In early October, he ordered all US troops out of Syria, having been persuaded to take that course of action by Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, only to command his forces back in little more than two weeks later, to \u201csecure the oil\u201d. He diverted nearly $13bn in military construction projects and thousands of troops to help build his long-promised wall on the southern border. He abruptly cut off year-long negotiations with the Taliban in September, but declared them back on during his Thanksgiving visit to Afghanistan. There was no apparent shift in underlying circumstances in either case. Trump is fond of talking about \u201cmy military\u201d, but the claim is less true with every passing month. Veterans still support him in significantly greater numbers than the general population, but he no longer has a lead among active duty service members, who are fairly evenly split between approval and disapproval. The damage done to the fabric of the military, by the divisions and uncertainty stirred up by the commander-in-chief, is harder to calculate. \u201cBy intervening, Trump is creating circumstances where the men and women in uniform are being asked to take sides between the superior officers and the president,\u201d Mulligan said. \u201cIt makes you wonder: is nothing sacred? Sadly, the answer is no.\u201d",

That\u2019s been a feature of Johnson\u2019s career since his low-budget debut feature, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/14/philipfrench\" title=\"\">Brick</a></em> (2005), transposed a dark, 1940s noir narrative to the sunny environs of a modern California high school, with attention-grabbing results. In 2012\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/30/looper-review-bruce-willis-emily-blunt\" title=\"\">Looper</a></em>, he turned a time-travel adventure into a bleak meditation upon the consequences of solving problems through violence.

      "bodyText": "Describing his thrillingly playful attitude toward genre cinema, writer/director Rian Johnson once told me that he loved the \u201cslightly meta conversation it opens between you and the viewer\u201d \u2013 the way that a shared set of ground rules can be assumed and then subverted. That\u2019s been a feature of Johnson\u2019s career since his low-budget debut feature, Brick (2005), transposed a dark, 1940s noir narrative to the sunny environs of a modern California high school, with attention-grabbing results. In 2012\u2019s Looper, he turned a time-travel adventure into a bleak meditation upon the consequences of solving problems through violence. More recently, his 2017 Star Wars movie, The Last Jedi, outraged some hardcore fans who didn\u2019t think the series\u2019 ever-evolving mythology should be up for discussion. In the deliciously entertaining Knives Out, Johnson goes back to his roots with an updated homage to the Agatha Christie whodunnits he loved as a child, and to those \u201ccheekily self-aware\u201d screen adaptations in which Peter Ustinov would lead an all-star cast through a labyrinthine murder mystery. The setting is a gothic pile in modern-day New England where crime-writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) has recently capped his 85th birthday celebrations by dying dramatically in his attic study. It looks like an open-and-shut suicide, but could one of Harlan\u2019s variously leechy family members (witheringly described as a bunch of \u201cself-made over-achievers\u201d) have slit his throat?

      "body": "<p>My friends online will be familiar with the phrase \u201clate-stage capitalism\u201d and its associated examples, including Tesco\u2019s festive mulled wine-scented toilet paper (delightful) and the mammoth black iPhone advertising hoardings (less so) <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/landlord-blocks-tenants-windows-huge-illegal-iphone-11169853/\" title=\"\">installed over the windows</a> of low-income flats in east London \u2013 the landlord had sold their tenants\u2019 daylight.</p> <p>It is one of those useful phrases that encompasses the discomfort and farce of modern life, at a time when inequality rises like sea levels, competition is sewn into everyday life, stability and security in work are fairy tales, yet the handful of corporations that control the textures of our life play our political fears back to us in jingles, co-opting politics to sell us Pepsi. On my desk I have packages containing 1 x \u201cempowering\u201d sheet-mask for the vulva, another containing a \u00a350 eco-friendly water bottle that jangles with \u201ccleansing crystals\u201d and, stuck in a notebook, a photo ripped from a magazine of a pair of jeans that came ready-muddied, to show its wearer can \u201cget down and dirty\u201d, \u00a3350. Here we are, broken.</p> <p>The phrase was originally used by Marxist theorists in the 20th century, but popularised online about two years ago, with thousands of memes and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/\" title=\"\">Reddit posts</a> competing to share examples of feverish marketing attempts and evidence of pitiless choices by those controlling the cash. And so it was this phrase that rolled, marble-like into my mind when I was sent news of Marie Kondo\u2019s new online shop. Yes, this is the same Marie Kondo whose 2015 book on decluttering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/14/decluttering-a-load-of-junk-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying\" title=\"\">I read closely</a>, like many others, in order to improve my life, and whose international success led to a Netflix show and status as a celebrity tidying consultant, and a doubling of contributions to charity shops across the world.</p> <p>By inviting us to hold each of our shirts, each of our books, our photographs, the small chipped heirlooms of past relationships in our hands and asking us to keep it only if it \u201csparked joy\u201d, she ushered in the possibility of pure control. While not inherently minimalist (a trigger word for me, a person who, after half a glass of wine will happily burn down the superiority that comes with a \u201ccapsule wardrobe\u201d and expensive asceticism) her teachings leaned heavily towards the \u201cstuff is bad; bin all your crap\u201d school of thought.</p> <p>Still, it should be no surprise that as 2019 crawls bloodily to a close, whispering hoarsely to the year ahead, \u201cLeave me behind, I\u2019ll only slow you down\u201d, that a Kondo <a href=\"https://shop.konmari.com/\" title=\"\">shop</a>, selling new crap to those whose homes echo nakedly since she first entered their lives, should open. And right before Christmas, too.</p> <p>This is <em>Kondo II: Back in the Habit</em>, where she reveals the masterplan, her very own economy, a cycle of buying and binning in search of true happiness. The shop itself is Goop-like in its ambitions of expensive wellness, with joy-sparking products, such as a crumb brush ($24), 4,096hz tuning fork with smoky quartz crystal ($75) and \u201ccomputer brush\u201d ($35). There are five different sizes of octagonal plates to organise your emptinesses.

      "bodyText": "My friends online will be familiar with the phrase \u201clate-stage capitalism\u201d and its associated examples, including Tesco\u2019s festive mulled wine-scented toilet paper (delightful) and the mammoth black iPhone advertising hoardings (less so) installed over the windows of low-income flats in east London \u2013 the landlord had sold their tenants\u2019 daylight. It is one of those useful phrases that encompasses the discomfort and farce of modern life, at a time when inequality rises like sea levels, competition is sewn into everyday life, stability and security in work are fairy tales, yet the handful of corporations that control the textures of our life play our political fears back to us in jingles, co-opting politics to sell us Pepsi. On my desk I have packages containing 1 x \u201cempowering\u201d sheet-mask for the vulva, another containing a \u00a350 eco-friendly water bottle that jangles with \u201ccleansing crystals\u201d and, stuck in a notebook, a photo ripped from a magazine of a pair of jeans that came ready-muddied, to show its wearer can \u201cget down and dirty\u201d, \u00a3350. Here we are, broken. The phrase was originally used by Marxist theorists in the 20th century, but popularised online about two years ago, with thousands of memes and Reddit posts competing to share examples of feverish marketing attempts and evidence of pitiless choices by those controlling the cash. And so it was this phrase that rolled, marble-like into my mind when I was sent news of Marie Kondo\u2019s new online shop. Yes, this is the same Marie Kondo whose 2015 book on decluttering I read closely, like many others, in order to improve my life, and whose international success led to a Netflix show and status as a celebrity tidying consultant, and a doubling of contributions to charity shops across the world. By inviting us to hold each of our shirts, each of our books, our photographs, the small chipped heirlooms of past relationships in our hands and asking us to keep it only if it \u201csparked joy\u201d, she ushered in the possibility of pure control. While not inherently minimalist (a trigger word for me, a person who, after half a glass of wine will happily burn down the superiority that comes with a \u201ccapsule wardrobe\u201d and expensive asceticism) her teachings leaned heavily towards the \u201cstuff is bad; bin all your crap\u201d school of thought. Still, it should be no surprise that as 2019 crawls bloodily to a close, whispering hoarsely to the year ahead, \u201cLeave me behind, I\u2019ll only slow you down\u201d, that a Kondo shop, selling new crap to those whose homes echo nakedly since she first entered their lives, should open. And right before Christmas, too. This is Kondo II: Back in the Habit, where she reveals the masterplan, her very own economy, a cycle of buying and binning in search of true happiness. The shop itself is Goop-like in its ambitions of expensive wellness, with joy-sparking products, such as a crumb brush ($24), 4,096hz tuning fork with smoky quartz crystal ($75) and \u201ccomputer brush\u201d ($35). There are five different sizes of octagonal plates to organise your emptinesses. The sponge ($16) and tea scoop ($54) are already out of stock, some gentle mums surely due, on Boxing Day, to quietly ask their offspring if they kept the receipts. Late-stage capitalism sits in these colourful octagonal plates, smiling its thin grin. There is something reassuring, though, about the predictability of a tidying guru asking you to clear just enough space to house a range of her own branded products. Elsewhere, across a single day, I watch \u201cclean eating\u201d influencers sell cookery books passing on diet advice gleaned from a lifetime of eating disorders, monetising guilt and shame and adorable little energy balls.

It contains an image, a hearse in a wood, that stayed with me. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to disappear from your own life, this book will speak to you. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/14/you-will-be-safe-here-damian-barr-review\" title=\"\">You Will Be Safe Here</a></em> by Damian Barr (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99) is another debut, but you\u2019d never know it from the lean, beautiful prose.

It\u2019s such a beautiful memoir, and it gives you a rich and complex portrait of the city. Her book, which will be published in the UK next year, has something in common with another nonfiction book I loved this year: Patrick Radden Keefe\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/say-nothing-9780008159252.html\" title=\"\">Say Nothing</a></em> (HarperCollins, \u00a39.99), which also uses one family\u2019s story to tell a broader history \u2013 in this case, of the Troubles and all the disappeared. One of Keefe\u2019s gifts is dramatising the individual decisions that collectively shape global history. I admired that same gift in Miriam Toews\u2019s extraordinary <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/10/women-talking-miriam-toews-review\" title=\"\">Women Talking</a></em> (Faber, \u00a38.99), which is a fictional treatment of a horrific series of sexual crimes in a remote religious community. The novel is an understated but powerful look at how everyday people make sense of evil and violence \u2013 a truly beautiful, challenging portrait of moral discernment.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de3ecc4f6affe2d27c960901c3e5fd5332161364\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de3ecc4f6affe2d27c960901c3e5fd5332161364/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dust jackets of the books chosen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1dd1284a217700612eda3598428993c7db99f3aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dd1284a217700612eda3598428993c7db99f3aa/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"Mark Haddon\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Mark Haddon</h2> <p><strong>Shortlisted for the Goldsmiths </strong><strong>prize for The </strong><strong>Porpoise</strong></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/friday-black-9781787476004.html\" title=\"\">Friday Black</a></em>, a collection of short stories by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah (Quercus, \u00a38.99), has the thrilling strangeness of George Saunders but driven by a deep and justified anger about the racism and violence that constitute the bedrock of American society. That makes it sound worthy. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a rollercoaster ride. Lucy Ellmann\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/15/ducks-newburyport-by-lucy-ellmann-review\" title=\"\">Ducks, Newburyport</a></em> (Galley Beggar Press, \u00a313.99) is usually described as \u201ceight sentences of 1,000 pages\u201d, which conjures an image of a forbidding avant garde doorstop in the manner of Thomas Bernhard. On the contrary, it is very funny, very readable and one of those novels that expand the possibilities of what a novel can be and do. Chris Ware is one of the great writers of our generation whose graphic novels make most novels (both the graphic and the regular kind) seem thin and simplistic.

Partly influenced by dub poets such as Linton Kwesi Johnson and Jean \u201cBinta\u201d Breeze, it is a book for the air and the page, speculating on the complicated history of the New Cross fire and Grenfell.</p> <p>The next is <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/deaf-republic-9780571351411.html\" title=\"\">Deaf Republic</a></em> by Ilya Kaminsky (Faber, \u00a310.99), a book for our times and all times. A high lyric cautionary tale of fascism, which is part poetry, part fable, part play.

It is a stunning research on \u201cinformation civilisation\u201d, concentration of power and the sinister exploitation of our data at the expense of our freedom, which are no doubt some of the most pressing issues of our times. But more than that, this is a fascinating and wise and honest exploration of what it means to be human in the digital age and why we need to fight back. Technology is way too important to leave it to tech companies, which are clearly becoming tech monopolies. We all need to become part of this important discussion, and for that to happen, we need to ask the right questions. This book is a brilliant way to do that.</p> <p>I loved Helon Habila\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/travellers-9780241394502.html\" title=\"\">Travelers</a></em> (Penguin, \u00a312.99). Such a wonderful gem. The book is composed of several stories of people from completely different backgrounds \u2013 students, academics, outcasts; these are heartbreaking but equally life-affirming tales that might seem separate at first, but then beautifully connect and intertwine in the end, leaving us longing for more. Where is home, where does exile start or does it ever end?</p> <p>I would also wholeheartedly recommend Lemn Sissay\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/my-name-is-why-9781786892348.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">My Name Is Why</a></em> (Canongate, \u00a316.99). This powerful and unflinchingly honest memoir has so much to say about the failures of our system and the silences of our society \u2013 being black, being in foster care, the struggle for identity, belonging, equality and dignity... A must-read book for anyone who refuses to be \u201cdefined by darkness\u201d and injustice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"960a1caf930074c1f5c4d9256360185d4718b0c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/960a1caf930074c1f5c4d9256360185d4718b0c6/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dust jackets of the books chosen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d9a45e74b832d629fabd51375b75dead60928a7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9a45e74b832d629fabd51375b75dead60928a7a/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"James Clarke\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>James Clarke</h2> <p><strong>Winner of the Betty Trask </strong><strong>award for The Litten Path</strong></p> <p>Elizabeth Hardwick\u2019s shimmering melancholia <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sleepless-nights-9780571346998.html\" title=\"\">Sleepless Nights</a></em> was given a crisp reissue in 2019 (Faber, \u00a38.99), 40 years after it was first published, and it\u2019s my book of the year. It\u2019s a dream slideshow, part memoir, part missive, part fiction, a work of lasting beauty that guides you through the mysteries, and tragedies of people the narrator has known and loved: the literary equivalent of polished onyx. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/this-is-pleasure-9781788165037.html\" title=\"\">This Is Pleasure</a></em> by Mary Gaitskill (Profile Books, \u00a37.99) tells the story of an influential publisher brought down in a sexual misconduct scandal. It\u2019s a stunningly written, arch look at transgression and our need to feel understood and confided in, and in an age of calling out groping men who think they can hide behind their money, it\u2019s of the moment too. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/nobber-9781529389098.html\" title=\"\">Nobber</a></em> by Oisin Fagan (John Murray, \u00a312.99) is the book about medieval Ireland I never knew I wanted.

The book is also a homage to Auden\u2019s aphoristic prose, and such identification with another has its own point to make: an artistic persona, necessarily half borrowed, can take you so far, but the work itself must stay truthful.

Toby Green\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-fistful-of-shells-9780241003176.html\" title=\"\">A Fistful of Shells</a></em> (Allen Lane, \u00a330) uses a global archive \u2013 in Africa, the Americas and Europe \u2013 to explore the complex, flourishing and connected economy of West Africa existing long before a European capitalist system established itself on the continent. Extraordinarily written and researched, the book paints a huge, complex canvas, filled with individual detail. Azadeh Moaveni\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/guest-house-for-young-widows-9781912854608.html\" title=\"\">Guest </a></em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/guest-house-for-young-widows-9781912854608.html\" title=\"\">House for Young Widows</a></em> (Scribe UK, \u00a316.99) brilliantly illuminates the transnational lives and choices of women who joined Isis. Resting on interviews across Europe and the Middle East, it subtly, carefully explains how such women took the path they did.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ab6822220468878e11f7da45b4e1dd41e0ba33c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ab6822220468878e11f7da45b4e1dd41e0ba33c/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dust jackets of the books chosen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"703443a429adf5e752b2af85b0cc9f48a029b06c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/703443a429adf5e752b2af85b0cc9f48a029b06c/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"David Keenan\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>David Keenan</h2> <p><strong>Winner of the Gordon Burn award for For the Good </strong><strong>Times</strong></p> <p>The most incredible book I read this year was Paul Kingsnorth\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/savage-gods-9781908213723.html\" title=\"\">Savage Gods</a></em> (Little Toller, \u00a314), a dramatic self-accounting that explodes \u201cnature writing\u201d to strain at the limits of language itself. Kingsnorth charts the breakdown of his faith in words, in nature as an uncomplicated restorative, in the idea of \u201cprogress\u201d, while fearlessly tracking his conclusions to their very ends. This is a writer \u2013 and a writer that burns \u2013 attempting to cure himself of writing, on the page, and it leads to some profound, and just as often jaw-dropping, insights. Kingsnorth\u2019s two novels, <em>The </em><em>Wake</em> and <em>Beast</em>, were masterpieces. But it\u2019s hard to imagine where he might go after this. Nowhere, perhaps.</p> <p>My favourite novel was <em><a href=\"https://www.influxpress.com/bindlestiff\" title=\"\">Bindlestiff</a></em> by Wayne Holloway (Influx Press, \u00a39.99), a riotous, high-energy vision of future America and contemporary Hollywood that is dizzying in its imagination as it jumps between prose and film script and tears through modes and genres with a high modernist glee and a rock\u2019n\u2019roll swagger. My favourite short story collection was Wendy Erskine\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sweet-home-9781529017069.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Sweet Home</a></em> (Picador, \u00a312.99). The prose is amazing, the dialogue perfect; Erskine is attuned to the momentous surrealism of everyday life in contemporary Belfast, where different rules continue to apply.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6116e24681ce463433cb6675c44d9983be8e3c7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6116e24681ce463433cb6675c44d9983be8e3c7a/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dust jackets of the books chosen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e849bfee2c81da121c03b230ceb8d754fa070b63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e849bfee2c81da121c03b230ceb8d754fa070b63/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"Lesley Nneka Arimah\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Lesley Nneka Arimah</h2> <p><strong>Winner of the Caine </strong><strong>prize for African </strong><strong>fiction for </strong><strong>Skinned</strong></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/576721/sabrina-and-corina-by-kali-fajardo-anstine/\" title=\"\">Sabrina </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/576721/sabrina-and-corina-by-kali-fajardo-anstine/\" title=\"\">&amp; Corina</a></em> by Kali Fajardo-Anstine (Random House USA Inc, \u00a322.50) is a gem of a short story collection that evinces enviable skill and a broad range as Fajardo-Anstine unfolds both sweeping and intimate stories of indigenous and Latin experiences in the American west. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/house-of-stone-9781786493187.html\" title=\"\">House of Stone</a></em> by Novuyo Rosa Tshuma (Atlantic, \u00a38.99) is a literary, historical page-turner - a tall order that Tshuma achieves in this exceptional debut. There are several gasp-out-loud twists and a narrator who charms and offends in equal measure, even as the novel thoughtfully examines a brutal period in Zimbabwe\u2019s history.

HM Parshley cut De Beauvoir\u2019s analysis of housework and references to women\u2019s anger, along with 78 women\u2019s names from the women\u2019s history section.

He is the first Arab writer to explore homosexuality so sincerely and extensively. His novel was inspired by a very famous case in Egypt: in 2001, 52 men were arrested in a nightclub because of their sexuality. The author adopts the point of view of one of them so the reader becomes effectively embedded in the gay community of a country where homosexuals are systematically persecuted. This beautifully written and poetic book moved me to tears; it is an ode to freedom and a real act of bravery. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-sport-of-kings-9780007313266.html\" title=\"\">The Sport</a></em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-sport-of-kings-9780007313266.html\" title=\"\"> of Kings</a></em> by CE Morgan (4th Estate, \u00a316.99) was translated into French in January 2019.

I experienced the same pleasure reading it as I got from the great classical novels I read as a teenager. Its variety of characters and scenes makes it hard to categorise. The former seem so real, so alive, you can almost touch them; Lalami has a wonderful, very tender way of exploring their souls.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c71c6ee36fe5ee8bcbda35bff5642eb97afed52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c71c6ee36fe5ee8bcbda35bff5642eb97afed52/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dust jackets of the books chosen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a4e2bc6af8a1febd9c9460cf3cfb63b5390b6fca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4e2bc6af8a1febd9c9460cf3cfb63b5390b6fca/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"Tayari Jones\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Tayari Jones</h2> <p><strong>Winner of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction for An American Marriage</strong></p> <p>One of my favourite novels of 2019 is <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/you-will-be-safe-here-9781408886083.html\" title=\"\">You Will Be Safe Here</a></em> by Damian Barr (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99), which is almost like two novels at once. The first half is an unflinching look at the second Boer war at the turn of the 20th century. Be warned; this is a demanding read. Any war, even one known as \u201cthe last gentlemen\u2019s war\u201d, is marked by unchecked brutality and Barr never lets us lose sight of the toll of the inhumanity inflicted on the Boers and that they inflict on the indigenous people of South Africa. Then, with grace and artistry, he weaves this story with that of a modern-day gay conversion camp that bears far too close a resemblance to the conditions of war. There is pain on these pages and poetry too. I left this book bruised yet somehow better for it.</p> <p>I also loved <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/patsy-9781786076564.html\" title=\"\">P</a></em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/patsy-9781786076564.html\" title=\"\">atsy</a></em> by Nicole Dennis-Benn (Oneworld, \u00a316.99). It\u2019s a story about mothers, daughters and the high price immigrants pay to change their lives. My final pick is a gorgeous collection of poetry by Jericho Brown. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-tradition-9781529020472.html\" title=\"\">The Tradition</a></em> (Pan Macmillan, \u00a310.99) spins poetic gold from the exquisite pain and pleasure of being black in America.</p>",

      "bodyText": "* * * Jojo Moyes Shortlisted for novel of the year at the British Book awards for Still Me I often find it hard to remember what I\u2019ve read, but Three Women by Lisa Taddeo (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99) scorched its way into my consciousness. A journalistic deep dive into the desires and love lives of three women over eight years, it turns on its head much of what you think about how we learn to love. Kate Weinberg\u2019s debut, The Truants (Bloomsbury, \u00a38.99), took eight years to write, and it shows in the multilayered characters and plot. It contains an image, a hearse in a wood, that stayed with me. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to disappear from your own life, this book will speak to you. You Will Be Safe Here by Damian Barr (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99) is another debut, but you\u2019d never know it from the lean, beautiful prose. I was afraid this novel about violence through generations in South Africa would be too dark, but it pulls you in, breaks your heart and then ultimately repairs it. * * * Bernardine Evaristo Joint winner of the Booker prize for Girl, Woman, Other Taking Up Space: The Black Girl\u2019s Manifesto for Change (Merky Books, \u00a312.99) by Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi is a groundbreaking and essential book about how it feels to be a young black woman studying in Britain\u2019s white academic institutions. Zawe Ashton\u2019s entertaining, fictionalised account of her life as an actor in Character Breakdown (Vintage, \u00a316.99) is funny, revealing, shocking and inventively structured with conversations presented in script form. Ghost Wall by Sarah Moss (Granta, \u00a38.99) is a slim novel about an iron age-obsessed man who takes his wife and daughter on a re-enaction holiday. It begins weirdly, ends badly and I loved it. * * * Casey Cep Shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford prize for Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud and the Last Trial of Harper Lee I visited New Orleans for the first time on my book tour and was so grateful to have Sarah Broom\u2019s The Yellow House (Little, Brown, \u00a314.99) with me for the journey. It\u2019s such a beautiful memoir, and it gives you a rich and complex portrait of the city. Her book, which will be published in the UK next year, has something in common with another nonfiction book I loved this year: Patrick Radden Keefe\u2019s Say Nothing (HarperCollins, \u00a39.99), which also uses one family\u2019s story to tell a broader history \u2013 in this case, of the Troubles and all the disappeared. One of Keefe\u2019s gifts is dramatising the individual decisions that collectively shape global history. I admired that same gift in Miriam Toews\u2019s extraordinary Women Talking (Faber, \u00a38.99), which is a fictional treatment of a horrific series of sexual crimes in a remote religious community. The novel is an understated but powerful look at how everyday people make sense of evil and violence \u2013 a truly beautiful, challenging portrait of moral discernment. * * * Mark Haddon Shortlisted for the Goldsmiths prize for The Porpoise Friday Black, a collection of short stories by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah (Quercus, \u00a38.99), has the thrilling strangeness of George Saunders but driven by a deep and justified anger about the racism and violence that constitute the bedrock of American society. That makes it sound worthy. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a rollercoaster ride. Lucy Ellmann\u2019s Ducks, Newburyport (Galley Beggar Press, \u00a313.99) is usually described as \u201ceight sentences of 1,000 pages\u201d, which conjures an image of a forbidding avant garde doorstop in the manner of Thomas Bernhard. On the contrary, it is very funny, very readable and one of those novels that expand the possibilities of what a novel can be and do. Chris Ware is one of the great writers of our generation whose graphic novels make most novels (both the graphic and the regular kind) seem thin and simplistic. I spent 20 minutes reading the cover of Rusty Brown (Cape, \u00a325). Buy it. Buy all his work. Make your life larger. * * * Raymond Antrobus Winner of the Rathbones Folio prize for The Perseverance Choosing three books from such a great year, particularly for poetry collections, is hard but there are three politically and lyrically compelling books that I think will remain relevant in the years ahead. The first is Surge by Jay Bernard (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a310). Partly influenced by dub poets such as Linton Kwesi Johnson and Jean \u201cBinta\u201d Breeze, it is a book for the air and the page, speculating on the complicated history of the New Cross fire and Grenfell. The next is Deaf Republic by Ilya Kaminsky (Faber, \u00a310.99), a book for our times and all times. A high lyric cautionary tale of fascism, which is part poetry, part fable, part play. Finally, After the Formalities by Anthony Anaxagorou (Penned in the Margins, \u00a39.99), which speculates on race, family and immigration. * * * William Feaver Shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford prize for The Lives of Lucian Freud: Youth 1922-1968 William Dalrymple\u2019s stupendous The Anarchy (Bloomsbury, \u00a330) propels into focus the story of the East India Company\u2019s takeover of Mughal India, an exercise of opportunism, violence, shamelessness and, at times, heroic greed. More immediate is Edna O\u2019Brien\u2019s Girl (Faber, \u00a316.99), an unflinching parable: Heart of Darkness revisited with Boko Haram horrors recounted as incipient legend. For me, Michael Bird\u2019s Artists\u2019 Letters (White Lion Publishing, \u00a320) has proved ideal dipping. Letters reproduced, transcribed and annotated yield rare insights: Leonardo (\u201cI will assemble catapults\u201d) with (Edward) Lear\u2019s spelling (\u201cfewcher thyme\u201d) and Mondrian\u2019s sore tooth. * * * Lucy Ellmann Winner of the Goldsmiths prize for Ducks, Newburyport Three Muslim women have surreal adventures in Leila Aboulela\u2019s latest novel, Bird Summons (W&amp;N, \u00a316.99), her wildest yet, full of her own take on myth, religion and womanhood. Aboulela, based in Aberdeen, deserves as big a following here as she has in Africa. Or bigger. Not strictly new, perhaps, but still terrific: Faber &amp; Faber has republished five Thomas Bernhard novels, shamefully out of print in the UK for 20 years. If you haven\u2019t read Bernhard, you will not know of the most radical advance in fiction since Joyce. Bernhard\u2019s influence is pervasive and his style riskily contagious. My advice: dive in. As for my third choice, am I allowed to choose a book I guest edited this year? It is the fourth and final volume of The Evergreen, a beautifully designed anthology of poetry and prose published by the Word Bank (\u00a315), an indie based in Edinburgh\u2019s Old Town. The latest issue, dedicated to the \u201cfuture\u201d, is devoted solely to writing by women and is international in flavour. Suzy Romer discusses the vital role of grandmothers in Spain, Kylie Grant revels in Glasgow\u2019s litter and, in Monica Datta\u2019s astounding Zus!, three young Dutch sisters decide to rustle up a canal system for the US. * * * Olivia Laing Winner of the James Tait Black memorial prize for fiction for Crudo Being increasingly future-averse, I was gripped by the title of I\u2019ve Seen the Future and I\u2019m Not Going by Peter McGough before I tracked down a copy (it\u2019s only published in the US), but this memoir is truly fascinating; a rags-to-riches rollercoaster about the 1980s art boom in downtown New York. McGough wanted to escape the ugliness of the 20th century by retreating to the past; meanwhile, in Mother Ship (Vintage, \u00a314.99), novelist Francesca Segal celebrates the technological innovations that kept her twins, born 10 weeks prematurely, alive. It\u2019s a song of praise to the beleaguered, indomitable NHS, with writing at such a pitch that it lingered with me all year. Speaking of enviable phrase-making, I was also smitten by music critic par excellence Ian Penman\u2019s It Gets Me Home, This Curving Track (Fitzcarraldo, \u00a312.99), a collection of dazzling, singular essays on Prince, James Brown, Sinatra, Elvis that gets to the heart of why music exerts such a strange power in our lives. * * * Hilary McKay Winner of the Costa children\u2019s book award for The Skylarks\u2019 War For me, 2019 has been a year of fantasy and folk tales, both new and retold, in every age group. For children, Lampie and the Children of the Sea (Pushkin Press, \u00a312.99) by Annet Schaap stood out. Lampie, the daughter of a lighthouse keeper, is a girl of great and grumpy courage, with a salty way with words. One day she forgets to buy matches and the lighthouse lantern doesn\u2019t shine. So begins a dark-and-stormy-night of a fairytale that I absolutely loved. For adults, my choice is poetry: The Women Left Behind (Dempsey &amp; Windle, \u00a310) by Imogen Russell Williams. Rapunzel\u2019s witch; Blodeuwedd, who was shaped from flowers; and Romeo\u2019s Rosaline, among many others \u2013 English literature forgot them, closed the door and turned away. Now at last we have their voices: wry, lamenting, vengeful, witty, bright, magnificent. Last, a book for everyone: Deeplight (Pan Macmillan, \u00a39.99) by Frances Hardinge. A stunning new ocean mythology of friendship and lost gods, it\u2019s complex, engrossing and gorgeously written, and kept me reading until past 3am but was worth it, over and over. * * * Melissa Harrison Winner of the European Union prize for literature for All Among the Barley I was dazzled by Sandra Newman\u2019s The Heavens (Granta, \u00a312.99), which had a time-travel premise (and a noteworthy cameo) that really shouldn\u2019t have worked but absolutely did. How she pulled it off is anyone\u2019s guess, but it left me hugely envious of her confidence and skill. Into a stagnating UK marketplace for memoirs about place came Jessica J Lee\u2019s beautiful Two Trees Make a Forest: On Memory, Migration and Taiwan (Little, Brown, \u00a316.99). Lee is editor of the Willowherb Review, publishing nature writing by writers of colour, including Nina Mingya Powles, winner of the inaugural Nan Shepherd prize. Lisa Taddeo\u2019s Three Women (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99) dives deep into the erotic lives of three women, using source material collected over hundreds of hours of interviews. The resulting account of the awakening, distortion and expression of desire in three very different lives is insightful, devastating and utterly unforgettable. * * * Lindsey Hilsum Winner of the James Tait Black memorial prize for biography with In Extremis: The Life of War Correspondent Marie Colvin It\u2019s been a year of disinformation, but Peter Pomerantsev has given us a guide in This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality (Faber, \u00a314.99). By dissecting the techniques governments use to create myths and sow confusion, he shows how the freedom of expression his parents sought when they fled the Soviet Union is now used to justify twisting the truth. No such tricks in Our Women on the Ground: Essays By Arab Women Reporting from the Middle East, edited by Zahra Hankir (Harvill Secker, \u00a314.99), which showcases journalism at its bravest. Determination, grit and humour shine through the writing of reporters who frequently face opposition from their own families. Maybe fiction is the best respite from strife and the ever more difficult daily task of telling facts from falsehoods. Mark Haddon\u2019s The Porpoise (Chatto and Windus, \u00a318.99) reworks legend with the compelling force of a thriller. Here, myth is not a distraction, but the key to a deeper truth. * * * Muhammad Khan Winner of the Branford Boase award for I Am Thunder Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas by Adam Kay (Picador, \u00a39.99) is a fun-size follow-up to the wildly popular This Is Going to Hurt. More stories from the frontline of the NHS that will hit you in the feels and also have you ho-ho-hoing over the festive season. Patrice Lawrence\u2019s Rose, Interrupted (Hachette, \u00a37.99) is a marvellous novel that explores what life is like for a pair of siblings after they are excommunicated from a strict religious sect. Rose seeks freedom, while her brother Rudder seeks redemption. Rounding out my top three is Fearscape: Vol 1 by Ryan O\u2019Sullivan (Vault Comics, \u00a315.99) \u2013 a comically dark and witty graphic novel with a narrator who is unreliable, delusional and downright despicable. Once a generation the Muse travels to Earth to take our greatest storyteller back with her to battle fear-creatures. But then she mistakes Henry, a shameless plagiarist, for the best and all hell breaks loose. * * * Sally Nicholls Shortlisted for the Carnegie medal for Things a Bright Girl Can Do My eldest started school in September, so education has been very much on my mind. I devoured Kate Clanchy\u2019s Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me (Picador, \u00a316.99) therefore. Covering everything from uniform to off-rolling, this is an incredibly readable memoir of 30 years as an English teacher and poet. I also enjoyed Emma Darwin\u2019s This Is Not a Book About Charles Darwin (Holland House, \u00a314.99), an exploration of her failure to write a novel about her famous ancestor and his illustrious family. Finding the spaces in real history to tell a fictional story is a problem I am very familiar with. Recommended. Finally, I\u2019ve never read a Hilary McKay novel I didn\u2019t love, and The Time of Green Magic (Macmillan, \u00a312.99) was no exception. This story of blended families and a house where books come to life would make a perfect Christmas present for any bookish nine- to 12-year-old. * * * Bart van Es Winner of the Costa book of the year award for The Cut Out Girl Over the last few years I have become fascinated by so-called autofiction: books that read like novels (with dialogue, metaphors and precise descriptions) but which are also, at some level, memoirs or autobiographies. Rachel Cusk is a master of the genre and her collection of sharp, provocative essays, Coventry (Faber, \u00a314.99), the follow-up to her Outline trilogy, had me transfixed. I also loved Will by the Flemish author Jeroen Olyslaegers (Pushkin, \u00a314.99), which tells the story of Antwerp under Nazi occupation. The narrator, a policeman who both resists and collaborates in the Holocaust, is a brilliant, morally complex creation. Will is now out in a fine translation and is a compelling read. Finally, Greta Thunberg\u2019s collection of speeches, No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference (Penguin, \u00a32.99), is simple and truthful. She inspired me to join the Extinction Rebellion protests earlier this year. * * * Elizabeth Acevedo Winner of the Carnegie medal for The Poet X For Black Girls Like Me by Mariama J Lockington (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux Inc, \u00a313.99) is a story about a transracial adoptee that had me tearing up, gasping and rooting for the main character, Makeda. It stretched my imagination about the kinds of tough topics a young person can handle reading about. I am so thankful for this honest, gorgeous book. Natasha Diaz\u2019s novel Color Me In (Penguin Random House, \u00a313.99), about a black Jewish poet in Harlem undergoing her bat mitzvah, is such a good book focused on faith, race, rites of passage and the way that young people have to learn not only to stand up for themselves, but also for their communities, especially when they belong to communities that wield power over others. Jacqueline Woodson\u2019s latest novel, Red at the Bone (W&amp;N, \u00a314.99), is a beast of a book; a masterclass on pace, characterisation and how a writer can be flexible. You\u2019ll find yourself rooting for every character, and hurting for them as well. * * * Elif Shafak Shortlisted for the Booker prize for 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World One of my favourite books this year has been Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism (Profile, \u00a310.99). It is a stunning research on \u201cinformation civilisation\u201d, concentration of power and the sinister exploitation of our data at the expense of our freedom, which are no doubt some of the most pressing issues of our times. But more than that, this is a fascinating and wise and honest exploration of what it means to be human in the digital age and why we need to fight back. Technology is way too important to leave it to tech companies, which are clearly becoming tech monopolies. We all need to become part of this important discussion, and for that to happen, we need to ask the right questions. This book is a brilliant way to do that. I loved Helon Habila\u2019s Travelers (Penguin, \u00a312.99). Such a wonderful gem. The book is composed of several stories of people from completely different backgrounds \u2013 students, academics, outcasts; these are heartbreaking but equally life-affirming tales that might seem separate at first, but then beautifully connect and intertwine in the end, leaving us longing for more. Where is home, where does exile start or does it ever end? I would also wholeheartedly recommend Lemn Sissay\u2019s My Name Is Why (Canongate, \u00a316.99). This powerful and unflinchingly honest memoir has so much to say about the failures of our system and the silences of our society \u2013 being black, being in foster care, the struggle for identity, belonging, equality and dignity... A must-read book for anyone who refuses to be \u201cdefined by darkness\u201d and injustice. James Clarke Winner of the Betty Trask award for The Litten Path Elizabeth Hardwick\u2019s shimmering melancholia Sleepless Nights was given a crisp reissue in 2019 (Faber, \u00a38.99), 40 years after it was first published, and it\u2019s my book of the year. It\u2019s a dream slideshow, part memoir, part missive, part fiction, a work of lasting beauty that guides you through the mysteries, and tragedies of people the narrator has known and loved: the literary equivalent of polished onyx. This Is Pleasure by Mary Gaitskill (Profile Books, \u00a37.99) tells the story of an influential publisher brought down in a sexual misconduct scandal. It\u2019s a stunningly written, arch look at transgression and our need to feel understood and confided in, and in an age of calling out groping men who think they can hide behind their money, it\u2019s of the moment too. Nobber by Oisin Fagan (John Murray, \u00a312.99) is the book about medieval Ireland I never knew I wanted. Plague-ridden, trippy and violent, it\u2019s uniquely told and full of startling images. * * * Diana Evans Winner of the South Bank Sky Arts award and shortlisted for the Orwell prize, the Women\u2019s prize for fiction and the Rathbones Folio prize for Ordinary People Hair is no small subject for the African diaspora, indeed for the history of colonialism and imperialism, which pretty much includes all of us, so I\u2019ve been pleasantly engrossed this autumn in Emma Dabiri\u2019s excellent nonfiction debut Don\u2019t Touch My Hair (Allen Lane, \u00a316.99). Part memoir, part spiky, thoroughly researched sociopolitical analysis, it delves deep into the painful realities and history of follicular racism while offering useful maintenance tips in the process. Of the poetry I\u2019ve been reading this year, Anthony Anaxagorou\u2019s second collection, After the Formalities (Penned in the Margins, \u00a39.99), stands out for its sharp and beguiling, imaginative scope and the endlessly surprising electricity of its language: \u201cI can fit my childhood into a fist\u201d; \u201cthere\u2019s a kind of shaking the living perform\u201d. And speaking of imaginative scope, there are few writers who possess quite the boundless daring of Irenosen Okojie, whose second collection of short stories, Nudibranch (Little, Brown, \u00a314.99), is dazzling, a feast for the senses, as well as a lesson in both creative and existential bravery. * * * Stuart Turton Winner of the Costa first novel award for The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle Let\u2019s start with The Hug by Eoin McLaughlin and Polly Dunbar (Faber, \u00a36.99), because it\u2019s utterly lovely. It\u2019s a children\u2019s book I read to my young daughter, and it makes her face light up every time she hears it. Reading to give somebody else pleasure isn\u2019t a thing I\u2019ve done before, but it\u2019s surprisingly wonderful. The Porpoise by Mark Haddon (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a318.99) is the book I\u2019ve recommended the most this year, because it\u2019s the one I had the most fun with. It kept shifting as I read it, changing from action to romance to science-fiction. It\u2019s dizzying. And then there\u2019s A History of the Bible: The Book and Its Faiths by John Barton (Allen Lane, \u00a325). I was brought up Roman Catholic and I\u2019m fascinated/annoyed by the way religion still entangles itself in my thought processes, long past the point I stopped believing in any of it. This book has helped unpick some of my mental knots. * * * Chigozie Obioma Shortlisted for the Booker prize for An Orchestra of Minorities Lucy Ellmann\u2019s Ducks, Newburyport (Galley Beggar Press, \u00a313.99) stretches the imagination and brings to the universe it seeks to recreate such intensity of purpose and flamboyance that one would be hard-pressed to think of any other word other than \u201coriginal\u201d to describe it. I very much admired Yiyun Li\u2019s Where Reasons End (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99), a highly unusual novel in which a writer confronts one of life\u2019s deepest sorrows in losing her child. It is a conceptual novel that challenges the form, but the exchanges between the mother and son are funny, touching and profoundly moving. Perhaps one of the most underrated novels of the year is Novuyo Rosa Tshuma\u2019s House of Stone (Atlantic, \u00a38.99), an expansive tale that celebrates a nation through a central character. Were it written about any western country, this novel would have been much talked about, but we are talking Zimbabwe here. It is an ambitious and daring novel from a promising writer. * * * Will Eaves Winner of the Wellcome book prize for Murmur. Also shortlisted for the James Tait Black memorial prize for fiction The Library of Ice (Scribner, \u00a39.99), Nancy Campbell\u2019s essay on art, science and life in the Arctic, has the direct seriousness of the early Pelican nonfiction list. It\u2019s wittily arranged, too: one section segues from Bill Jacklin\u2019s Rink mural at Washington airport to Noel Streatfeild\u2019s White Boots, and thence to Torvill and Dean\u2019s 1980s figure-skating routines. With a similar associative light touch, Ian Sansom\u2019s September 1, 1939 (4th Estate, \u00a316.99) invokes Vladimir Nabokov and Ed Sheeran to illuminate WH Auden\u2019s famous poem. The book is also a homage to Auden\u2019s aphoristic prose, and such identification with another has its own point to make: an artistic persona, necessarily half borrowed, can take you so far, but the work itself must stay truthful. These distinctions are caught, beautifully and unexpectedly, in novelist Paul Bailey\u2019s first collection of poems, Inheritance (CB Editions, \u00a38.99), about age and self-consciousness, in which the shedding of one literary skin reveals another. Claire Adam Winner of the Desmond Elliott prize for Golden Child Here are three recent books that, once opened, I couldn\u2019t put down. I came across the essay collection Constellations by Sin\u00e9ad Gleeson (Picador, \u00a316.99) in the bookshop of the British Library: I\u2019d put aside the day for my own work and ended up standing by the display table, getting in everyone\u2019s way, turning page after page, quite unable to tear myself away. Self-Portrait, Celia Paul\u2019s memoir (Jonathan Cape, \u00a320), I read on my Kindle, until two in the morning when I should have been asleep; it was the photograph of the artist in a bare room that drew me in \u2013 how I wished my life afforded me that bare room. Finally, Lemn Sissay\u2019s memoir, My Name Is Why (Canongate, \u00a316.99), which I read in one compulsive sitting: a book that reminds me, as it should remind us all, that the state of childhood is a state of profound vulnerability. * * * Tommy Orange Shortlisted for the Rathbones Folio prize for There There The three books I enjoyed reading the most in 2019 are Ocean Vuong\u2019s On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous (Vintage, \u00a312.99), Valeria Luiselli\u2019s Lost Children Archive (4th Estate, \u00a316.99), and Samanta Schweblin\u2019s Mouthful of Birds (Oneworld, \u00a312.99). Ocean\u2019s novel because it is just so very full of beauty and power. Also, grace. Valeria\u2019s novel because it is exquisitely smart, funny and thrilling, and Samanta\u2019s stories because they are so new and strange and good. Her collection makes me want to use the trite and overused descriptor Kafkaesque, but I won\u2019t. * * * Hallie Rubenhold Winner of the Baillie-Gifford prize for The Five: The Untold Lives of the Women Killed By Jack the Ripper Top of my list is Lisa Taddeo\u2019s Three Women (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99). The best stories are often true ones; an intimate examination of three women\u2019s sex lives is a seductive subject in itself, but the sumptuous and visceral writing made this book an enthralling read. Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a320) provided the perfect escapist pleasure, cleverly knitting together strands from both her novel The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and its television adaptation. Observing Atwood work with two storytelling mediums has been an education. Lara Maiklem\u2019s Mudlarking (Bloomsbury, \u00a318.99) is testimony to the beauty of micro-history and how small objects and unknown figures are capable of telling large, panoramic stories. In this case, the author has constructed a history of London from artefacts found on the Thames foreshore. * * * Julia Lovell Shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford prize for Maoism: A Global History I\u2019ve chosen three books that make us see the world in new, connected ways. William Dalrymple\u2019s The Anarchy (Bloomsbury, \u00a330) tells the extraordinary story of how the East India Company became a ruthless colonising power that throughout the 18th century effectively ended Mughal control of India. The book is a powerful, timely reminder of the dangerous power of corporate excess. Toby Green\u2019s A Fistful of Shells (Allen Lane, \u00a330) uses a global archive \u2013 in Africa, the Americas and Europe \u2013 to explore the complex, flourishing and connected economy of West Africa existing long before a European capitalist system established itself on the continent. Extraordinarily written and researched, the book paints a huge, complex canvas, filled with individual detail. Azadeh Moaveni\u2019s Guest House for Young Widows (Scribe UK, \u00a316.99) brilliantly illuminates the transnational lives and choices of women who joined Isis. Resting on interviews across Europe and the Middle East, it subtly, carefully explains how such women took the path they did. * * * David Keenan Winner of the Gordon Burn award for For the Good Times The most incredible book I read this year was Paul Kingsnorth\u2019s Savage Gods (Little Toller, \u00a314), a dramatic self-accounting that explodes \u201cnature writing\u201d to strain at the limits of language itself. Kingsnorth charts the breakdown of his faith in words, in nature as an uncomplicated restorative, in the idea of \u201cprogress\u201d, while fearlessly tracking his conclusions to their very ends. This is a writer \u2013 and a writer that burns \u2013 attempting to cure himself of writing, on the page, and it leads to some profound, and just as often jaw-dropping, insights. Kingsnorth\u2019s two novels, The Wake and Beast, were masterpieces. But it\u2019s hard to imagine where he might go after this. Nowhere, perhaps. My favourite novel was Bindlestiff by Wayne Holloway (Influx Press, \u00a39.99), a riotous, high-energy vision of future America and contemporary Hollywood that is dizzying in its imagination as it jumps between prose and film script and tears through modes and genres with a high modernist glee and a rock\u2019n\u2019roll swagger. My favourite short story collection was Wendy Erskine\u2019s Sweet Home (Picador, \u00a312.99). The prose is amazing, the dialogue perfect; Erskine is attuned to the momentous surrealism of everyday life in contemporary Belfast, where different rules continue to apply. * * * Lesley Nneka Arimah Winner of the Caine prize for African fiction for Skinned Sabrina &amp; Corina by Kali Fajardo-Anstine (Random House USA Inc, \u00a322.50) is a gem of a short story collection that evinces enviable skill and a broad range as Fajardo-Anstine unfolds both sweeping and intimate stories of indigenous and Latin experiences in the American west. House of Stone by Novuyo Rosa Tshuma (Atlantic, \u00a38.99) is a literary, historical page-turner - a tall order that Tshuma achieves in this exceptional debut. There are several gasp-out-loud twists and a narrator who charms and offends in equal measure, even as the novel thoughtfully examines a brutal period in Zimbabwe\u2019s history. Tressie McMillan Cottom is a genius. In Thick and Other Essays (New Press, \u00a313.99) she articulates America\u2019s social dimensions in regards to race, gender, education and class with a studied consideration born of intensive research, shored with the digestibility of personal experience. I have long been a fan of her work and Thick delivered beyond my already high expectations. * * * Caroline Criado Perez Winner of Books Are My Bag readers\u2019 choice award and Royal Society insight investment science book prize for Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men This has been a bumper year for dog-related memoirs and while obviously I loved them all (all dog memoirs are good girls), Lost Dog: A Love Story by Kate Spicer (Ebury, \u00a316.99) was my favourite. Funny, touching and absolutely right about the redeeming power of the pooch. A doggy page-turner: I read it straight through in two days. Fleishman Is in Trouble by Taffy Brodesser-Akner (Wildfire, \u00a318.99) was a minute, unsparing examination of the breakdown of a marriage. I kept having to stop to take pictures of passages (some of which ran on for pages) to send to friends because it was just too accurate. Sad, mad and funny. Also features a bonus dog. The bombshell revelation of Becoming Beauvoir (Bloomsbury, \u00a320), Kate Kirkpatrick\u2019s excellent biography of Simone de Beauvoir, is the bowdlerisation of The Second Sex by the man who translated this seminal feminist text into English. HM Parshley cut De Beauvoir\u2019s analysis of housework and references to women\u2019s anger, along with 78 women\u2019s names from the women\u2019s history section. He kept in references to men\u2019s feelings, though. * * * Leila Slimani Winner of the British book awards fiction debut award for Lullaby Muhammad Abdelnabi is one of the most brilliant Egyptian authors today and rightly received the Arab literature prize for La chambre de l\u2019araign\u00e9e (In the Spider\u2019s Room) (the American University in Cairo Press, \u00a39.99). He is the first Arab writer to explore homosexuality so sincerely and extensively. His novel was inspired by a very famous case in Egypt: in 2001, 52 men were arrested in a nightclub because of their sexuality. The author adopts the point of view of one of them so the reader becomes effectively embedded in the gay community of a country where homosexuals are systematically persecuted. This beautifully written and poetic book moved me to tears; it is an ode to freedom and a real act of bravery. The Sport of Kings by CE Morgan (4th Estate, \u00a316.99) was translated into French in January 2019. It tells the story of a redemption and is a declaration of love to horses. I was really impressed by the author\u2019s style and lyricism and the way she described violence inside a family and between social classes. The Other Americans by Laila Lalami (Bloomsbury Circus, \u00a316.99) is probably one of the most powerful books I\u2019ve read these past few years on immigration and the US. I experienced the same pleasure reading it as I got from the great classical novels I read as a teenager. Its variety of characters and scenes makes it hard to categorise. The former seem so real, so alive, you can almost touch them; Lalami has a wonderful, very tender way of exploring their souls. * * * Tayari Jones Winner of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction for An American Marriage One of my favourite novels of 2019 is You Will Be Safe Here by Damian Barr (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99), which is almost like two novels at once. The first half is an unflinching look at the second Boer war at the turn of the 20th century. Be warned; this is a demanding read. Any war, even one known as \u201cthe last gentlemen\u2019s war\u201d, is marked by unchecked brutality and Barr never lets us lose sight of the toll of the inhumanity inflicted on the Boers and that they inflict on the indigenous people of South Africa. Then, with grace and artistry, he weaves this story with that of a modern-day gay conversion camp that bears far too close a resemblance to the conditions of war. There is pain on these pages and poetry too. I left this book bruised yet somehow better for it. I also loved Patsy by Nicole Dennis-Benn (Oneworld, \u00a316.99). It\u2019s a story about mothers, daughters and the high price immigrants pay to change their lives. My final pick is a gorgeous collection of poetry by Jericho Brown. The Tradition (Pan Macmillan, \u00a310.99) spins poetic gold from the exquisite pain and pleasure of being black in America.",

      "body": "<p>For a moment in 1999, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/02/shenmue-sega-classic-14-years-too-late\" title=\"\">Shenmue</a></em> represented the future of all video games. And in some ways, Sega\u2019s grand murder mystery, set in late-80s Japan, has defined the medium. With a reported budget of $20m and a supporting battalion of artists, designers and programmers, it was the first game to show that video-game publishers could make financial wagers at Hollywood blockbuster-scale. Likewise, <em>Shenmue\u2019s </em>star director, Yu Suzuki, then in his early 40s, laid a template that has defined the games that dominate today\u2019s charts: a living virtual city filled with diversions and populated by AI-controlled characters that worked to daily routines; shops that opened to defined schedules; a world that strained at the seams of its technological circumstance.</p> <p>Still, while <em>Shenmue</em> came with a cinematic plot \u2013 you play as a young Japanese man, Ryo Hazuki, trying to disentangle the threads of his father\u2019s murder \u2013 its slow-burn rhythm was almost art-house in pace. Suzuki later said his aim was to replicate not realism, but reality, with all of its periods of listlessness and boredom. As such, the game was filled with daily chores, repetitious part-time work, all the stuff that, ostensibly, people play video games to escape. The gamble did not pay off. Only two of the planned six instalments in the series were released. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/grand-theft-auto\" title=\"\">Grand Theft Auto 3\u2019s</a></em> arrival in 2001, with its cinematic set pieces and celebrity voice actors, changed the arc of video game design, probably inevitably. The market decided <em>Shenmue\u2019s </em>vision of the future was too quirky, and consequently the murder of Ryo\u2019s father went unresolved.</p> <p>Until now. Thanks to the rickety miracle of crowdfunding, Suzuki has been able to rally a sufficient number of invested fans (the game immediately became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/20/shenmue-iii-game-kickstarter-yu-suzuki\" title=\"\">the highest-funded yet on Kickstarter</a>) to continue the story. Twenty years on, <em>Shenmue\u2019s </em>third entry arrives, not as a future-defining vision, but as a relic of a lost era, complete with low-polygon 3D models and straight-to-DVD acting. There\u2019s more here than mere nostalgic allure for the middle-aged, however. The unhurried storytelling and orthodox detective work \u2013 virtual hours of chatting to villagers in search of leads, and rifling through musty drawers \u2013 has an honest, if, for the contemporary player, initially jarring appeal.

      "bodyText": "For a moment in 1999, Shenmue represented the future of all video games. And in some ways, Sega\u2019s grand murder mystery, set in late-80s Japan, has defined the medium. With a reported budget of $20m and a supporting battalion of artists, designers and programmers, it was the first game to show that video-game publishers could make financial wagers at Hollywood blockbuster-scale. Likewise, Shenmue\u2019s star director, Yu Suzuki, then in his early 40s, laid a template that has defined the games that dominate today\u2019s charts: a living virtual city filled with diversions and populated by AI-controlled characters that worked to daily routines; shops that opened to defined schedules; a world that strained at the seams of its technological circumstance. Still, while Shenmue came with a cinematic plot \u2013 you play as a young Japanese man, Ryo Hazuki, trying to disentangle the threads of his father\u2019s murder \u2013 its slow-burn rhythm was almost art-house in pace. Suzuki later said his aim was to replicate not realism, but reality, with all of its periods of listlessness and boredom. As such, the game was filled with daily chores, repetitious part-time work, all the stuff that, ostensibly, people play video games to escape. The gamble did not pay off. Only two of the planned six instalments in the series were released. Grand Theft Auto 3\u2019s arrival in 2001, with its cinematic set pieces and celebrity voice actors, changed the arc of video game design, probably inevitably. The market decided Shenmue\u2019s vision of the future was too quirky, and consequently the murder of Ryo\u2019s father went unresolved. Until now. Thanks to the rickety miracle of crowdfunding, Suzuki has been able to rally a sufficient number of invested fans (the game immediately became the highest-funded yet on Kickstarter) to continue the story. Twenty years on, Shenmue\u2019s third entry arrives, not as a future-defining vision, but as a relic of a lost era, complete with low-polygon 3D models and straight-to-DVD acting. There\u2019s more here than mere nostalgic allure for the middle-aged, however. The unhurried storytelling and orthodox detective work \u2013 virtual hours of chatting to villagers in search of leads, and rifling through musty drawers \u2013 has an honest, if, for the contemporary player, initially jarring appeal. If anything, the pacing has slowed further still. Shenmue 3 opens in rural China, where water is drawn from a well, fish are caught from a river, and the evening entertainment consists of placing bets on where a dropped ball-bearing might land. Yes, there are occasional fisticuffs (training Ryo in the local dojo to improve his fighting skills is the most video-gamey this gets), but the dominant tone is one of unhurried investigation. Submit to the spell and the effect is beguiling. At the time of Shenmue\u2019s original release, it was understood that video games offered an escape from the boredom of reality. In more recent years, the success of myriad games in which players are invited to engage in, essentially, virtual work \u2013 Car Mechanic Simulator, Farming Simulator, Euro Truck Simulator, and so on \u2013 has demonstrated that our relationship with games is more complicated.

We\u2019ll fund more safe bike lanes, fill in potholes and give every child the chance to learn to ride a bike \u2013 safely.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Analysis: </strong>The last Tory government may have overseen a <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/821842/walking-and-cycling-statistics-2018-accessible.pdf\">decline in national cycling</a> levels, setting itself up to miss its own targets by two-thirds due to a lack of funding. However, Boris Johnson is currently party leader \u2013 the man who, as London mayor, led a major cycling investment programme, with some excellent protected cycle lanes bustling from day one. With his former London cycling commissioner, the journalist Andrew Gilligan, now working in No 10, the Tories have upped their game a little.</p> <p>However, \u00a3350m over five years is tiny in transport terms and pales in comparison to what other parties are offering. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2019/jun/24/what-14bn-buys-1800-miles-of-cycle-lanes-or-one-big-roundabout\">Manchester alone</a> needs \u00a31.4bn for its city-wide cycling and walking programme.</p> <p>Proposed \u201ctough new design standards\u201d, similar to those introduced in London during Johnson\u2019s mayoralty, are sorely needed. Many councils waste scarce funds on DIY standards, often with poor results. A pothole fund is similarly welcome: our decaying road surfaces are particularly dangerous for cycling.</p> <p>A dedicated cycling fund of a decent size could reduce cycle funding complexity, and pay for some of the currently unfunded council plans. This is not a decent size, sadly. The last Conservative government said cycling money existed in, among other places, the Housing Infrastructure Fund (HIF), but even with a Tory council, this seemed impossible to get. On the B4044 in Oxfordshire, for example, the council removed plans for a bike path from a road widening bid to the HIF because they believed it \u201c<a href=\"https://road.cc/content/news/268633-safe-cycle-route-plan-road-where-rider-killed-was-dropped-ps102m-infrastructure\">reduced the business case of the bid</a>\u201d.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s missing</strong>: Adequate funding. Heaton-Harris agreed funding is piecemeal \u2013 but there is no guaranteed funding after five years, making it impossible for councils to make long term plans. The universal credit system needs clarity for disabled people who cycle, so they <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/half-of-disabled-cyclists-fear-being-seen-on-their-bikes-in-case-they-lose-benefits_uk_5c0118c4e4b0d04f48b30d83\">no longer fear losing their benefits</a> for appearing \u201ctoo active\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Labour</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b58272e0e496d300bc81879da73e2066b1340a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b58272e0e496d300bc81879da73e2066b1340a2/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is often seen riding his distinctive red bicycle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is often seen riding his distinctive red bicycle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Main pledges:</strong> \u00a350 per head per year on cycling by the end of the term, amounting to \u00a37.2bn a year. Deliver 5,000km (3,100 miles) of cycleways within the first term; provide safe cycling and walking routes to 10,000 primary schools; \u00a3200 grants for e-bike purchase and support for an \u201ce-bike valley\u201d industrial cluster. Bring back Cycling (and now also Walking) England, axed in the bonfire of the quangos, to deliver councils\u2019 plans. Ring-fencing of vehicle excise duty (sometimes misleadingly dubbed \u201croad tax\u201d) to include sustainable transport. Doubling of Bikeability funding to cover all primary school children, plus secondary school children, and adults. Fully fund the Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy which sets targets to double cycling by adults and children by 2025. Cycling and bicycles on prescription; a \u201ccycling and walking social investment fund\u201d to support active travel in \u201cleft-behind areas\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Funding pledge on cycling: </strong>\u00a34.7bn on capital funding with \u00a32.5bn for revenue funding in the first year, skewing towards revenue funding in later years.</p> <p><strong>Per head per year:</strong> \u00a350 per head per year by the end of the parliament.</p> <p><em><strong>Jeremy Corbyn, Labour leader</strong>:</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>\u201cI love walking and cycling so I\u2019m proud of the policies we\u2019ve announced today to give millions of people the freedom to walk and cycle along convenient, attractive routes, safe from traffic danger.

Our plans will transform opportunities so that travelling actively and healthily is an option for the many, not just the bold and fearless.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Summary: </strong>\u00a38.2bn a year is a huge amount of money for cycling. This programme, if successfully implemented, would be transformative \u2013 opening up cycling as a genuine transport option up and down the country. Funds would come from vehicle excise duty, says Labour \u2013 ie the polluter pays. The goal of the plans is to cut congestion and air pollution, which is responsible for at least 40,000 deaths a year, boost health and improve towns and cities.</p> <p>Labour says it will initially skew towards revenue spending, ie cycle training and subsidies, while infrastructure plans are developed and capacity built within councils \u2013 many of whom have limited cycling plans or expertise. Later, funding will skew towards delivering infrastructure. </p> <p>Labour says there will be design standards for infrastructure, which would hopefully avoid substandard cycle routes.</p> <p>Given the right conditions, e-bikes could replace up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2017/apr/13/how-much-could-commuter-cycling-increase-in-your-part-of-england\">one in four car trips</a> \u2013 with purchase subsidies in Europe not only proving popular, but <a href=\"https://www.bicycleassociation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Case-for-a-UK-Incentive-for-E-bikes-FINAL.pdf\">blowing e-car incentives out of the water</a> in carbon reduction bang for your buck. </p> <p>Universal cycle training, in the form of Bikeability, is something the Conservatives and Greens also propose. Labour says it will extend the offer to secondary school children and adults \u2013 a good move as adult cycle training can help give lapsed riders the confidence to return to the saddle, and parents not cycling can hinder children using their new-found skills.</p> <p><strong>Interesting aside:</strong> Investing in an e-bike technology hub, where research and development and manufacturing are concentrated, is rather an unknown. E-bikes arguably have potential as a shot in the arm to Britain\u2019s cycling industry, but manufacturing requires serious equipment and expertise we don\u2019t currently have in the UK. What\u2019s more Portugal already has a highly competitive \u201ce-bike valley\u201d, with business incentives we may struggle to beat.</p> <h2><strong>Green party</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11676b52950081ffd1a905d10eb0e238972a7bea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11676b52950081ffd1a905d10eb0e238972a7bea/0_237_5706_3424/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman cycling in Cambridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Green party\u2019s ambitious cycling pledges include \u00a32bn a year on infrastructure.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Brooks/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Main pledges:</strong> As part of the party\u2019s \u201cgreen new deal\u201d, the it is pledging \u00a32.5bn a year for cycling over 10 years: that\u2019s \u00a32bn for infrastructure and \u00a30.5bn for supporting measures such as cycle training. The goal is for more than half of local trips up to five miles on foot or bike and continental levels of cycling within a decade. Also, a \u201cnew expert body for governance and advice\u201d will support local authorities to deliver improvements, to \u201conly fund infrastructure of the highest quality\u201d. Also low-traffic neighbourhoods, blocking rat-running traffic, with 20mph the default for residential areas as part of an aim for zero deaths and serious injuries on the roads. Ensuring all new housing is served by high-quality walking, cycling and public transport routes. Car-free access to national parks, car-free city centres, support for cycle hire, e-bike, cargo bike and non-standard bike subsidies. Investment in cycle access to public transport and major destinations, and \u201ca reliable, high-quality national cycle network to link up town and country\u201d. Effective enforcement inspired by West Midlands police\u2019s \u201charm reduction\u201d approach.</p> <p><strong>Funding pledge on cycling: </strong>\u00a32.5bn per year for 10 years.</p> <p><strong>Per head per year:</strong> \u00a342.</p> <p><em><strong>Caroline Russell, London assembly member:</strong></em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>\u201cEverything stems from responding to the climate emergency and the air pollution crisis with a deadline of 2030.

Enabling people to walk and cycle, leaving the car at home, perhaps never even buying another car would result in huge health improvements across the country.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A lot of ambition and detail \u2013 it reads like a campaigner\u2019s wish list. \u00a32.5bn is a lot of money to be found, some of which would presumably come from a ban on new roads. Spending would start lower, increasing over time, says the party\u2019s transport spokesperson, London Assembly member Caroline Russell.</p> <p>Most local authorities will be at a standing start on cycling, with no capacity or expertise for decent infrastructure. This is a challenge for any incoming government serious about cycling. The Greens say they would start by building on existing plans, while supporting councils without plans \u2013 a sensible approach. The Greens want to fully fund Manchester\u2019s Beeline network, and Russell made mention of the estimated \u00a32.8bn needed to bring the patchy National Cycle Network up to scratch.</p> <p>They pledge funding so all local authorities have \u201ca clear, costed and timetabled plan to deliver a high-quality network of walking and cycling routes by 2030\u201d. Any attempts to roll this out would depend on local politics, however.</p> <p>Russell cites \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/jun/26/mini-holland-schemes-have-proved-their-worth-in-outer-london-boroughs\">Mini Holland\u201d schemes</a> as a potential national template. Launched under Boris Johnson\u2019s London mayoralty, councils bid for funding for cycling and walking-friendly neighbourhoods and high streets. These would be granted four times a year under the Greens\u2019 plans.

      "bodyText": "In an election dominated by Brexit, the climate crisis and the NHS, cycling is not most people\u2019s top priority. However, with transport now accounting for a higher share of overall emissions than any other sector, helping people drive less and cycle more is arguably crucial in tackling climate change. Improving conditions for cycling could help our congested, polluted towns and cities, tackle the inactivity crisis, reduce the burden on the NHS and make streets and neighbourhoods safer and more pleasant. The Walking and Cycling Alliance wants \u00a317 per person per year to be spent on active travel, rising to \u00a334 per person by 2025. Spending is currently \u00a37 per person annually. But some parties are recognising cycling\u2019s potential and coming up with innovative and needed ideas. Others remain stuck in car land. Here is a quick guide to the key policies of the main parties. Conservatives Main pledges: A \u00a3350m cycling infrastructure fund over five years (\u00a370m a year), and \u201ctough new design standards, which must be followed to receive any money\u201d; a \u00a32bn pothole fund; Bikeability training for every child; pilots of low-traffic \u201chealthy neighbourhoods\u201d to reduce rat running on residential streets, with increased provision \u201cfor separated bike lanes on main roads\u201d; trials incentivising GPs to prescribe bicycles or bicycle hire to patients. There is mention of a \u201clong-term cycling programme and budget like the roads programme and budget, though of course smaller\u201d, though it is unclear if that refers to the \u00a3350m or something longer-term. Funding pledge on cycling: \u00a370m per year, each year of the new parliament; total \u00a3350m. Per head per year: \u00a31.18 \u2013 so less than the current spend. Chris Heaton-Harris, transport minister: \u201cCycling is good for health, both physical and mental, and it\u2019s good for the environment. Oh, and it\u2019s fun. Both the prime minister and I are keen cyclists (although I\u2019m a little more of a fairweather cyclist!) and our manifesto contains a bold offer for both adults and children. We\u2019ll fund more safe bike lanes, fill in potholes and give every child the chance to learn to ride a bike \u2013 safely.\u201d Analysis: The last Tory government may have overseen a decline in national cycling levels, setting itself up to miss its own targets by two-thirds due to a lack of funding. However, Boris Johnson is currently party leader \u2013 the man who, as London mayor, led a major cycling investment programme, with some excellent protected cycle lanes bustling from day one. With his former London cycling commissioner, the journalist Andrew Gilligan, now working in No 10, the Tories have upped their game a little. However, \u00a3350m over five years is tiny in transport terms and pales in comparison to what other parties are offering. Manchester alone needs \u00a31.4bn for its city-wide cycling and walking programme. Proposed \u201ctough new design standards\u201d, similar to those introduced in London during Johnson\u2019s mayoralty, are sorely needed. Many councils waste scarce funds on DIY standards, often with poor results. A pothole fund is similarly welcome: our decaying road surfaces are particularly dangerous for cycling. A dedicated cycling fund of a decent size could reduce cycle funding complexity, and pay for some of the currently unfunded council plans. This is not a decent size, sadly. The last Conservative government said cycling money existed in, among other places, the Housing Infrastructure Fund (HIF), but even with a Tory council, this seemed impossible to get. On the B4044 in Oxfordshire, for example, the council removed plans for a bike path from a road widening bid to the HIF because they believed it \u201creduced the business case of the bid\u201d. What\u2019s missing: Adequate funding. Heaton-Harris agreed funding is piecemeal \u2013 but there is no guaranteed funding after five years, making it impossible for councils to make long term plans. The universal credit system needs clarity for disabled people who cycle, so they no longer fear losing their benefits for appearing \u201ctoo active\u201d. Labour Main pledges: \u00a350 per head per year on cycling by the end of the term, amounting to \u00a37.2bn a year. Deliver 5,000km (3,100 miles) of cycleways within the first term; provide safe cycling and walking routes to 10,000 primary schools; \u00a3200 grants for e-bike purchase and support for an \u201ce-bike valley\u201d industrial cluster. Bring back Cycling (and now also Walking) England, axed in the bonfire of the quangos, to deliver councils\u2019 plans. Ring-fencing of vehicle excise duty (sometimes misleadingly dubbed \u201croad tax\u201d) to include sustainable transport. Doubling of Bikeability funding to cover all primary school children, plus secondary school children, and adults. Fully fund the Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy which sets targets to double cycling by adults and children by 2025. Cycling and bicycles on prescription; a \u201ccycling and walking social investment fund\u201d to support active travel in \u201cleft-behind areas\u201d. Funding pledge on cycling: \u00a34.7bn on capital funding with \u00a32.5bn for revenue funding in the first year, skewing towards revenue funding in later years. Per head per year: \u00a350 per head per year by the end of the parliament. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour leader: \u201cI love walking and cycling so I\u2019m proud of the policies we\u2019ve announced today to give millions of people the freedom to walk and cycle along convenient, attractive routes, safe from traffic danger. These policies will slash carbon emissions, tackle air pollution, save our NHS billions and boost our high streets by making towns and city centres more pleasant. Our plans will transform opportunities so that travelling actively and healthily is an option for the many, not just the bold and fearless.\u201d Summary: \u00a38.2bn a year is a huge amount of money for cycling. This programme, if successfully implemented, would be transformative \u2013 opening up cycling as a genuine transport option up and down the country. Funds would come from vehicle excise duty, says Labour \u2013 ie the polluter pays. The goal of the plans is to cut congestion and air pollution, which is responsible for at least 40,000 deaths a year, boost health and improve towns and cities. Labour says it will initially skew towards revenue spending, ie cycle training and subsidies, while infrastructure plans are developed and capacity built within councils \u2013 many of whom have limited cycling plans or expertise. Later, funding will skew towards delivering infrastructure. Labour says there will be design standards for infrastructure, which would hopefully avoid substandard cycle routes. Given the right conditions, e-bikes could replace up to one in four car trips \u2013 with purchase subsidies in Europe not only proving popular, but blowing e-car incentives out of the water in carbon reduction bang for your buck. Universal cycle training, in the form of Bikeability, is something the Conservatives and Greens also propose. Labour says it will extend the offer to secondary school children and adults \u2013 a good move as adult cycle training can help give lapsed riders the confidence to return to the saddle, and parents not cycling can hinder children using their new-found skills. Interesting aside: Investing in an e-bike technology hub, where research and development and manufacturing are concentrated, is rather an unknown. E-bikes arguably have potential as a shot in the arm to Britain\u2019s cycling industry, but manufacturing requires serious equipment and expertise we don\u2019t currently have in the UK. What\u2019s more Portugal already has a highly competitive \u201ce-bike valley\u201d, with business incentives we may struggle to beat. Green party Main pledges: As part of the party\u2019s \u201cgreen new deal\u201d, the it is pledging \u00a32.5bn a year for cycling over 10 years: that\u2019s \u00a32bn for infrastructure and \u00a30.5bn for supporting measures such as cycle training. The goal is for more than half of local trips up to five miles on foot or bike and continental levels of cycling within a decade. Also, a \u201cnew expert body for governance and advice\u201d will support local authorities to deliver improvements, to \u201conly fund infrastructure of the highest quality\u201d. Also low-traffic neighbourhoods, blocking rat-running traffic, with 20mph the default for residential areas as part of an aim for zero deaths and serious injuries on the roads. Ensuring all new housing is served by high-quality walking, cycling and public transport routes. Car-free access to national parks, car-free city centres, support for cycle hire, e-bike, cargo bike and non-standard bike subsidies. Investment in cycle access to public transport and major destinations, and \u201ca reliable, high-quality national cycle network to link up town and country\u201d. Effective enforcement inspired by West Midlands police\u2019s \u201charm reduction\u201d approach. Funding pledge on cycling: \u00a32.5bn per year for 10 years. Per head per year: \u00a342. Caroline Russell, London assembly member: \u201cEverything stems from responding to the climate emergency and the air pollution crisis with a deadline of 2030. We need to be at continental levels of cycling within 10 years. We should aim for more than half of local trips (up to five miles) to be made on foot or by bike. We need an inclusive approach to walking and cycling that reaches into all communities in villages, towns and cities. \u201cMaking it appealing, safe and easy to walk and cycle would \u2026 deal with the air pollution crisis, as well as the climate emergency. Enabling people to walk and cycle, leaving the car at home, perhaps never even buying another car would result in huge health improvements across the country.\u201d Summary: A lot of ambition and detail \u2013 it reads like a campaigner\u2019s wish list. \u00a32.5bn is a lot of money to be found, some of which would presumably come from a ban on new roads. Spending would start lower, increasing over time, says the party\u2019s transport spokesperson, London Assembly member Caroline Russell. Most local authorities will be at a standing start on cycling, with no capacity or expertise for decent infrastructure. This is a challenge for any incoming government serious about cycling. The Greens say they would start by building on existing plans, while supporting councils without plans \u2013 a sensible approach. The Greens want to fully fund Manchester\u2019s Beeline network, and Russell made mention of the estimated \u00a32.8bn needed to bring the patchy National Cycle Network up to scratch. They pledge funding so all local authorities have \u201ca clear, costed and timetabled plan to deliver a high-quality network of walking and cycling routes by 2030\u201d. Any attempts to roll this out would depend on local politics, however. Russell cites \u201cMini Holland\u201d schemes as a potential national template. Launched under Boris Johnson\u2019s London mayoralty, councils bid for funding for cycling and walking-friendly neighbourhoods and high streets. These would be granted four times a year under the Greens\u2019 plans. Traffic reduction as a national goal, with no new roads, is a worthy one: British transport planning is built on an assumption of ever-growing car use, a self-fulfilling prophesy. Policing is vital \u2013 West Midlands police\u2019s approach to close-passing drivers led to a drop in serious collisions by a fifth in its first year alone. Interesting asides: The Greens\u2019 manifesto mentioned woodchip bike paths \u2013 a curious but as yet unproven experiment from a Dutch town. Russell called this \u201ctoo much detail in the wrong place\u201d, but adds that paths could be more porous to prevent flooding \u2013 without being hard to cycle on. Liberal Democrats Main pledges: Spending 10% of the transport budget on cycling by the end of a five-year parliament. More devolution and power to councils to make decisions; using the planning process to reduce car dependency in new developments. \u201cA national strategy to promote cycling and walking, including the creation of dedicated safe cycling lanes\u201d; placing a far higher priority on encouraging walking and cycling; reducing car use; integration of rail, bus and cycle routes. Funding pledge on cycling: 10% of the transport budget by the end of a five-year parliament. Per head per year: Dependent on the transport budget. Caroline Pidgeon, London assembly member: \u201cQuite frankly, for decades governments have not given cycling the kind of priority it deserves.

Investment in cycle-rail schemes, namely cycle parking, has provided good returns under the Conservative government, and further links allowing commuters to cycle to train stations would help more people to cycle part of their journey rather than driving. Brexit party Main pledges: None \u2013 the Brexit party\u2019s press office did reply to the Guardian saying they were looking into the matter but never came back again. The policy platform on their website sets out investment priorities but does not mention cycling. Funding pledge on cycling: \u00a30. Per head per year: \u00a30. Summary: Light on cycling.

      "body": "<p>When Nancy Astor first took her seat in parliament on 1 December 1919, she was greeted with a \u201cbuzz of animated conversation\u201d from the men in the Commons according to reports. Astor, an American-born viscountess had won Plymouth Sutton in a by-election. Yet high up above in the wood-panelled press gallery, feminist history of a different kind was also being made. For the first time two female reporters were allowed to watch proceedings, effectively kick-starting female political journalism in Westminster.</p> <p>The two reporters\u2019 presence was covered in newspapers across the country. Marguerite Cody worked for the Daily News and Miss E Cohn for the Central News agency. Despite giving her account to the Daily Telegraph, in which she described the day as the \u201ccomplete recognition of the right of British women to take their place in the government of the nation\u201d, Cohn was not even afforded a first name, and nor is she given one in any of the write ups since. It remains lost to history.</p> <p>Marguerite Cody, however, went on to have a long and more visible career in journalism, later becoming the editor of the Liberal Women\u2019s News. She also had a sideline as a champion open-water swimmer, crossing Belfast Lough in 1913 in a time of four hours when she worked for the local paper. Cody and Cohn\u2019s history-making moment was short-lived \u2013 they were only allowed into the press gallery to report on Lady Astor and swiftly ejected.</p> <p>It had been quite the struggle to even get to that afternoon in 1919. The first official request for a female journalist to join the press gallery had taken place almost 30 years earlier. A Miss E Blain \u2013 again no first name \u2013 who was working for the early suffrage newspaper the Women\u2019s Penny Paper, applied for access in March 1890. Outraged at its treatment at the hands of a rather dismissive sergeant-at-arms, Henry David Erskine, the paper published in full their back and forth with him; an 1890 public shaming. Their account of his final say on the matter was: \u201cMale journalists would \u2026 much resent their intrusion, and he was afraid the consequent outcry would be terrific.\u201d</p> <p>By 1924 more female MPs arrived in Westminster after a string of general elections and by-elections. Stella Wolfe Murray arrived to report for the Daily Sketch. She also ran her own women\u2019s News and views column that featured in the Leeds Mercury. She was the first woman to work in the lobby, which gives reporters access to the members\u2019 lobby area to interview MPs in person. She was there to write about women\u2019s issues and legislation affecting children. She also wrote \u201cWomen\u2019s Topics\u201d for the Sheffield Independent.</p> <p>The Leeds Mercury was over the moon to have secured the first female lobby correspondent. On Tuesday 2 December 1924, they wrote: \u201cThe Leeds Mercury has always taken a pride in stating fairly all points of view in public life\u201d.</p> <p>Murray was a force of nature, and like Cody had her own gender-defying hobby for the time: flying planes. She later co-wrote <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Woman-Flying-Stella-Wolfe-MURRAY/dp/B0014LNCAO\">Woman and Flying</a> with aviator Lady Mary Heath who was the first person to fly from Cape Town to London. She turned her pen to everything from washing up to stove-top cooking, to the new Factories Act and equal pay campaigning championed by then socialist MP for Middlesbrough <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/case-study-radical-politicians-in-the-north-east/introduction/\">Ellen Wilkinson</a>. She also wrote about women at the top of their professional field, from \u201cSheffield\u2019s one policewoman\u201d to \u201cYorkshire\u2019s women engineers\u201d.</p> <p>A year later in 1925, Vera Hemmen joined the Daily Graphic with the Leeds Mercury cheering that \u201cwomen are strengthening their hold in journalism\u201d. Like Murray, Hemmen\u2019s range of topics was vast but a real coup was her interview with Prince Phillip\u2019s father Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark in 1929. Headlined a \u201cKing in Exile\u201d it was carried in many papers. She wrote of meeting him in a quiet London hotel where he said he was learning about Britain\u2019s post-war recovery. By that time he had been exiled for seven years. She found out he had quietly studied medicine, toured hospitals, mines, car plants and factories for inspiration.</p> <p>The first female MP turned journalist was the former member for North Lanark, Jennie Lee, who returned to the Commons in 1940 to work for the Daily Mirror.

      "bodyText": "When Nancy Astor first took her seat in parliament on 1 December 1919, she was greeted with a \u201cbuzz of animated conversation\u201d from the men in the Commons according to reports. Astor, an American-born viscountess had won Plymouth Sutton in a by-election. Yet high up above in the wood-panelled press gallery, feminist history of a different kind was also being made. For the first time two female reporters were allowed to watch proceedings, effectively kick-starting female political journalism in Westminster. The two reporters\u2019 presence was covered in newspapers across the country. Marguerite Cody worked for the Daily News and Miss E Cohn for the Central News agency. Despite giving her account to the Daily Telegraph, in which she described the day as the \u201ccomplete recognition of the right of British women to take their place in the government of the nation\u201d, Cohn was not even afforded a first name, and nor is she given one in any of the write ups since. It remains lost to history. Marguerite Cody, however, went on to have a long and more visible career in journalism, later becoming the editor of the Liberal Women\u2019s News. She also had a sideline as a champion open-water swimmer, crossing Belfast Lough in 1913 in a time of four hours when she worked for the local paper. Cody and Cohn\u2019s history-making moment was short-lived \u2013 they were only allowed into the press gallery to report on Lady Astor and swiftly ejected. It had been quite the struggle to even get to that afternoon in 1919. The first official request for a female journalist to join the press gallery had taken place almost 30 years earlier. A Miss E Blain \u2013 again no first name \u2013 who was working for the early suffrage newspaper the Women\u2019s Penny Paper, applied for access in March 1890. Outraged at its treatment at the hands of a rather dismissive sergeant-at-arms, Henry David Erskine, the paper published in full their back and forth with him; an 1890 public shaming. Their account of his final say on the matter was: \u201cMale journalists would \u2026 much resent their intrusion, and he was afraid the consequent outcry would be terrific.\u201d By 1924 more female MPs arrived in Westminster after a string of general elections and by-elections. Stella Wolfe Murray arrived to report for the Daily Sketch. She also ran her own women\u2019s News and views column that featured in the Leeds Mercury. She was the first woman to work in the lobby, which gives reporters access to the members\u2019 lobby area to interview MPs in person. She was there to write about women\u2019s issues and legislation affecting children. She also wrote \u201cWomen\u2019s Topics\u201d for the Sheffield Independent. The Leeds Mercury was over the moon to have secured the first female lobby correspondent. On Tuesday 2 December 1924, they wrote: \u201cThe Leeds Mercury has always taken a pride in stating fairly all points of view in public life\u201d. Murray was a force of nature, and like Cody had her own gender-defying hobby for the time: flying planes. She later co-wrote Woman and Flying with aviator Lady Mary Heath who was the first person to fly from Cape Town to London. She turned her pen to everything from washing up to stove-top cooking, to the new Factories Act and equal pay campaigning championed by then socialist MP for Middlesbrough Ellen Wilkinson. She also wrote about women at the top of their professional field, from \u201cSheffield\u2019s one policewoman\u201d to \u201cYorkshire\u2019s women engineers\u201d. A year later in 1925, Vera Hemmen joined the Daily Graphic with the Leeds Mercury cheering that \u201cwomen are strengthening their hold in journalism\u201d. Like Murray, Hemmen\u2019s range of topics was vast but a real coup was her interview with Prince Phillip\u2019s father Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark in 1929. Headlined a \u201cKing in Exile\u201d it was carried in many papers. She wrote of meeting him in a quiet London hotel where he said he was learning about Britain\u2019s post-war recovery. By that time he had been exiled for seven years. She found out he had quietly studied medicine, toured hospitals, mines, car plants and factories for inspiration. The first female MP turned journalist was the former member for North Lanark, Jennie Lee, who returned to the Commons in 1940 to work for the Daily Mirror. It was reported at the time that her husband, Welsh politician Nye Bevan, who had not yet begun his ground-breaking work on the NHS, provided her with \u201ceasy copy\u201d by asking a question in the chamber. Patricia O\u2019Brien (nee Newton) gives the most extensive account of those first few decades for female journalists in parliament. She left school at 14, and was a reporter by 16, and later was the first female reporter in the parliamentary press gallery for the Press Association. In 1946, she wrote a piece for one of her old papers, the Norwood News, headlined \u201cWoman Invades the Press Gallery\u201d and explained how she only got a foot in the door because a male editor had mistaken her name on an application \u201cPat\u201d for Patrick. \u201cI am called in when descriptions are needed of clothes worn by women minister and members and my opinion is sometimes sought when a reporter is writing a newsletter on things which affect women,\u201d she wrote. While men were afforded overnight accommodation within parliament on late sittings, there was nowhere for a woman, so O\u2019Brien had to \u201ccatch the early morning fish train\u201d home or if she was lucky \u201ccadge a lift on a milk lorry\u201d. She was fired on each occasion she became pregnant only to get her job back after some lobbying from MPs including Barbara Castle and Conservative Dame Irene Ward. In her obituary written by her children Tom and Francesca in 2009, they said: \u201cAs children it didn\u2019t seem odd that our mother Pat worked in the House of Commons where the policeman tipped his hat to us as our father (who stayed at home to look after us) drove her in and out. \u201cBut for the early sixties our parents were trailblazers and as we grew older our mother\u2019s quiet determination was a source of inspiration and great pride.\u201d There were other female political journalists of course but the archives do not throw up their stories easily, if they exist at all. Among those who followed was Julia Langdon, who joined the lobby in 1974 and was the first ever female political editor of a national daily newspaper, the Daily Mirror, from 1984 to 1989. She was the first female chair of the lobby and still has her lobby pass today. Her varied writing and broadcast work now includes penning obituaries for the Guardian. Elinor Goodman, the political editor of Channel 4 between 1988 and 2005, and the BBC\u2019s Carolyn Quinn, who was also the first female chair of the press gallery, are others who laid the groundwork for the current crop of women working in Westminster, even if they did not realise at the time. Women are enjoying a golden age for telling the nation\u2019s political stories with the appointment of the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg and Sky News\u2019 Beth Rigby to the political editorship roles for their organisations. The Guardian appointed Heather Stewart and Anushka Asthana as joint political editors in 2016, while Pippa Crerar is the political editor of the Daily Mirror. With social media, 24-hour news and online journalism, none of these women will suffer the fate of Miss E Cohn and be erased from the story they\u2019re helping to write.",

      "body": "<p>Emilia Clarke had a headache. It was 2011, just before Valentine\u2019s Day and just after she\u2019d wrapped on the first series of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">Game of Thrones</a></em>, playing Daenerys Targaryen, Breaker of Chains, Mother of Dragons. She didn\u2019t yet know, as she crawled into the locker room of her local gym in north London and vomited bile into the toilet, that <em>Game of Thrones</em> would run for seven further seasons, break Emmy-award records for most wins for a scripted television series and for a drama, be named one of the greatest TV shows of all time, and quickly come to define her. But there was much she didn\u2019t know.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know that at 24 she had suffered a life-threatening stroke, a <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/subarachnoid-haemorrhage/\" title=\"\">subarachnoid haemorrhage</a> (SAH) caused by bleeding into the space surrounding the brain. She didn\u2019t know, as she lay on the floor repeating lines from <em>Game of Thrones</em> in order to test her memory, that a third of SAH patients die immediately, or that those who survive require urgent treatment to avoid a second, often fatal bleed. She didn\u2019t know there was another swollen blood vessel in her brain, which had doubled in size by the time she finished filming season three. She didn\u2019t know that one day, eight years later, over biscuits on her pink sofa, she would be smiling with the dark realisation that her stroke was one of the best things that could have happened to her.</p> <p>Her pink sofa is in her pink house, which is also green and blue and muted shades of rust, and has a secret bar hidden in a courtyard shed, and an outdoor screening room heated by a wood-burning stove. To walk into her living room, where one corner is painted with a symbol relating to her mum, another to her late dad, and a third with a meaningful dragon, is to enter the cosiest corner of Clarke\u2019s mind. By the stairs, horsehair is visible in the plaster; the walls are stripped back to the bone. She shows me round with a raw sort of glee, a sense that her comfort and safety are bound into the details: the friends\u2019 art on the walls, the \u201csingle girl\u2019s\u201d bedroom. She moved in after <em>Game of Thrones</em>; in this and many ways, her life can be cleanly dissected into before and after.</p> <p>Before, Clarke, now 33, who grew up in Oxfordshire, had appeared in a single episode of the daytime soap <em>Doctors</em>. She was ambitious, optimistic and relentlessly cheerful. After, after <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and the death of her father, which shook her family, as did her life-threatening stroke, she is sitting on her pink sofa and contemplating a decade that changed her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"934ddd6a39d293687ef24b02f3bc96c691730d71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/934ddd6a39d293687ef24b02f3bc96c691730d71/0_108_2640_1584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jingle belle: starring in Last Christmas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jingle belle: starring in Last Christmas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Prime/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnd yes, I\u2019m at the point where I definitely think of the brain haemorrhage as a good thing,\u201d she nods. She has extremely expressive eyebrows that appear jointed \u2013 for every word Clarke says, and she says many, they add 15 more. \u201cBecause I was never destined to be the \u2018young actor goes off the rails\u2019 type, up and down the gossip columns. And having a brain haemorrhage that coincided precisely with the beginning of my career and the beginning of a show that became something quite meaty, it gave me a perspective that I wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019m quite a resilient human being, so a parent dying and brain haemorrhages coinciding with success and people following you in the street and getting stalkers \u2013 you\u2019re just, like, \u2018Well let\u2019s try and make something sensible of it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It was a decade that contained the very best and very worst of a life, and one of the sensible things she tried to make of it was the founding of a charity, <a href=\"https://www.sameyou.org/\" title=\"\">SameYou</a>, to provide treatment for people recovering from brain injuries and stroke. It was only in order to promote the charity that, eight years after her stroke, she finally decided to talk about <em>it</em>, in <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/emilia-clarke-a-battle-for-my-life-brain-aneurysm-surgery-game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">a piece for the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/emilia-clarke-a-battle-for-my-life-brain-aneurysm-surgery-game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">New Yorker</a></em>. \u201cOn the set, I didn\u2019t miss a beat, but I struggled,\u201d she wrote, of returning to <em>Game of Thrones</em> after brain surgery. \u201cSeason two would be my worst. I didn\u2019t know what Daenerys was doing. If I am truly being honest, every minute of every day I thought I was going to die.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s remarkable, considering her profile and her regular appearances in the <em>Daily Mail</em> in lovely dresses and grand smiles, that she managed to keep it secret for so long. She didn\u2019t want to tell strangers, \u201cBecause it was mine.\u201d She feared, too, that people would \u201csneer at it\u201d.</p> <p>It so happened that, the week before I went to meet her, I had a similar (though less dramatic) neurological diagnosis \u2013 when I tell her about it, for some reason my voice shakes. She is warm and quick with recommendations, and as she continues she says, \u201cWell, you <em>know</em>, then. You know the worries. That people will think your soul, your movement, your voice, who you were,\u201d was damaged. \u201cIt was nerve-racking to share it, to be honest. It always is, when you make yourself vulnerable.\u201d She waited so long to talk about it, because, \u201cI didn\u2019t want people to think of me as\u2026 sick.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a0ed632436e3d647fa1d642f302b8bb83c420de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a0ed632436e3d647fa1d642f302b8bb83c420de/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018After the last season, I felt like I had lost all the bones  in my body\u2019: Emilia Clarke in Game of Thrones in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018After the last season, I felt like I had lost all the bones in my body\u2019: in Game of Thrones in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF Archive/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are still days on set when she will quietly pull aside the makeup person and say, \u201c\u2018I think I\u2019m having a brain haemorrhage. I\u2019m not, I promise, but maybe just put me in a cold tent and we\u2019ll sit down for a second, and I apologise in advance if I freak you out.\u2019 Over the summer I was burning the candle at both ends, and I was with my mate on the plane. And I was like, \u2018Dude, I feel really weird\u2026\u2019 But I was fine. It\u2019s hard not to think the worst. It\u2019s hard to think you\u2019re overtired, or you\u2019ve been on Instagram too long, and to realise these might have the same side-effects as something deadly. But the charity evolves with me. I use it. Here\u2019s something else that I feel: maybe someone else feels the same way.\u201d</p> <p>She talks about the summer just gone with a regretful kind of wonder \u2013 it was th e summer after the <em>Game of Thrones</em> finale had divided fans, when she was coming to terms with how the \u201coverwhelming\u201d amount of nudity in the first season <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/20/emilia-clarke-game-of-thrones-nude-scenes-were-terrifying\" title=\"\">had affected her</a>. And, after years of \u201cfilling every hiatus with a movie, shit, good or otherwise\u201d (she starred opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/30/terminator-genisys-review-arnold-schwarzenegger\" title=\"\">Terminator Genisys</a></em>, and as Qi\u2019ra in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/solo--a-star-wars-story\" title=\"\">Solo: a Star Wars Story</a></em>) she had decided to take a break. Or, the decision was made for her.</p> <p>\u201cAfter we did the premiere for the last season, it felt suddenly like I lost all of the bones in my body. And I was in this puddle on the floor going, \u2018Maybe this isn\u2019t just the show.\u2019 I\u2019d never wanted to look around and see what we had, because I was convinced it was just going to blow up in our faces. And, well, at the end it kind of did. So I kept my head down. Then, after the premiere, I finally was able to stop, and that was difficult.\u201d She travelled and went \u201craving with my mates, but that was not fulfilling. So, bloated and exhausted I went away for two weeks with my best girlfriend, [<em>The Good </em><em>Fight</em> star] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/11/rose-leslie-ygritte-honeymoon-game-thrones\" title=\"\">Rose Leslie</a>, and it was in this retreat in India that I suddenly got it. This is what stopping feels like. And I was able to finally\u2026 be kind to myself.\u201d</p> <p>All this is recent. All this is really recent, with a new understanding of grief. Her beloved father, a theatre sound engineer, died of cancer in 2016. \u201cThe world felt like a scarier place once my dad wasn\u2019t in it,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cThere was the referendum, too,\u201d she shudders. \u201cIt was the year of everything bad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a606b558291b2cfd66617e2ee70312d5651e62ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a606b558291b2cfd66617e2ee70312d5651e62ea/0_2450_3937_3095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Actors are always observing, whatever  we are going through\u2019: Emilia Clarke wears a sleeveless silk dress by Maggie Marilyn at harveynichols.com\" width=\"1000\" height=\"786\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Actors are always observing, whatever we are going through\u2019: Emilia Clarke wears a sleeveless silk dress by Maggie Marilyn at <a href=\"http://harveynichols.com\">harveynichols.com</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Spring/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it was after her lost summer that, \u201cI finally got this feeling. As if, on a cellular level, I\u2019d grown up. And it\u2019s so bittersweet, because I was clinging on to that childlike optimism. Then, when I finally let it go, I realised that was actually quite a heavy backpack to be wearing. I felt like that at the Emmys, too, finally popping my head up from the bunker. It\u2019s as if you can see the actual landscape that you\u2019ve been living in this entire time from another perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Occasionally she looks at me apologetically, her eyebrows like arrows, to check she\u2019s not saying too much, and then she continues. \u201cIt can be perceived as such a feminine trait, can\u2019t it \u2013 the responsibility to \u2018put a smile on it\u2019. And, and you feel like it\u2019s a defeat if you give in and admit, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s not going to be OK in the end.\u2019 But then, if you do, then you have an opportunity to go\u2026 \u2018and what if that\u2019s all right?\u2019 Death is shit,\u201d she says, dramatically. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard and grief is horrific, and yet it is completely and utterly guaranteed. No matter how much Silicon Valley boys want to prove to everyone it\u2019s not. But the finality of death, the absolute certainty of it, I\u2019ve realised, is such a tonic.\u201d</p> <p>Along with a good stroke, I add the loss of a parent to her list of recommendations. \u201c<em>No</em>! I\u2019m not recommending it to anyone, obviously. But it is something real you can actually hold on to. We don\u2019t look at grief properly.

      "bodyText": "Emilia Clarke had a headache. It was 2011, just before Valentine\u2019s Day and just after she\u2019d wrapped on the first series of Game of Thrones, playing Daenerys Targaryen, Breaker of Chains, Mother of Dragons. She didn\u2019t yet know, as she crawled into the locker room of her local gym in north London and vomited bile into the toilet, that Game of Thrones would run for seven further seasons, break Emmy-award records for most wins for a scripted television series and for a drama, be named one of the greatest TV shows of all time, and quickly come to define her. But there was much she didn\u2019t know. She didn\u2019t know that at 24 she had suffered a life-threatening stroke, a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) caused by bleeding into the space surrounding the brain. She didn\u2019t know, as she lay on the floor repeating lines from Game of Thrones in order to test her memory, that a third of SAH patients die immediately, or that those who survive require urgent treatment to avoid a second, often fatal bleed. She didn\u2019t know there was another swollen blood vessel in her brain, which had doubled in size by the time she finished filming season three. She didn\u2019t know that one day, eight years later, over biscuits on her pink sofa, she would be smiling with the dark realisation that her stroke was one of the best things that could have happened to her. Her pink sofa is in her pink house, which is also green and blue and muted shades of rust, and has a secret bar hidden in a courtyard shed, and an outdoor screening room heated by a wood-burning stove. To walk into her living room, where one corner is painted with a symbol relating to her mum, another to her late dad, and a third with a meaningful dragon, is to enter the cosiest corner of Clarke\u2019s mind. By the stairs, horsehair is visible in the plaster; the walls are stripped back to the bone. She shows me round with a raw sort of glee, a sense that her comfort and safety are bound into the details: the friends\u2019 art on the walls, the \u201csingle girl\u2019s\u201d bedroom. She moved in after Game of Thrones; in this and many ways, her life can be cleanly dissected into before and after. Before, Clarke, now 33, who grew up in Oxfordshire, had appeared in a single episode of the daytime soap Doctors. She was ambitious, optimistic and relentlessly cheerful. After, after Game of Thrones, and the death of her father, which shook her family, as did her life-threatening stroke, she is sitting on her pink sofa and contemplating a decade that changed her. \u201cAnd yes, I\u2019m at the point where I definitely think of the brain haemorrhage as a good thing,\u201d she nods. She has extremely expressive eyebrows that appear jointed \u2013 for every word Clarke says, and she says many, they add 15 more. \u201cBecause I was never destined to be the \u2018young actor goes off the rails\u2019 type, up and down the gossip columns. And having a brain haemorrhage that coincided precisely with the beginning of my career and the beginning of a show that became something quite meaty, it gave me a perspective that I wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019m quite a resilient human being, so a parent dying and brain haemorrhages coinciding with success and people following you in the street and getting stalkers \u2013 you\u2019re just, like, \u2018Well let\u2019s try and make something sensible of it.\u2019\u201d It was a decade that contained the very best and very worst of a life, and one of the sensible things she tried to make of it was the founding of a charity, SameYou, to provide treatment for people recovering from brain injuries and stroke. It was only in order to promote the charity that, eight years after her stroke, she finally decided to talk about it, in a piece for the New Yorker. \u201cOn the set, I didn\u2019t miss a beat, but I struggled,\u201d she wrote, of returning to Game of Thrones after brain surgery. \u201cSeason two would be my worst. I didn\u2019t know what Daenerys was doing. If I am truly being honest, every minute of every day I thought I was going to die.\u201d It\u2019s remarkable, considering her profile and her regular appearances in the Daily Mail in lovely dresses and grand smiles, that she managed to keep it secret for so long. She didn\u2019t want to tell strangers, \u201cBecause it was mine.\u201d She feared, too, that people would \u201csneer at it\u201d. It so happened that, the week before I went to meet her, I had a similar (though less dramatic) neurological diagnosis \u2013 when I tell her about it, for some reason my voice shakes. She is warm and quick with recommendations, and as she continues she says, \u201cWell, you know, then. You know the worries. That people will think your soul, your movement, your voice, who you were,\u201d was damaged. \u201cIt was nerve-racking to share it, to be honest. It always is, when you make yourself vulnerable.\u201d She waited so long to talk about it, because, \u201cI didn\u2019t want people to think of me as\u2026 sick.\u201d There are still days on set when she will quietly pull aside the makeup person and say, \u201c\u2018I think I\u2019m having a brain haemorrhage. I\u2019m not, I promise, but maybe just put me in a cold tent and we\u2019ll sit down for a second, and I apologise in advance if I freak you out.\u2019 Over the summer I was burning the candle at both ends, and I was with my mate on the plane. And I was like, \u2018Dude, I feel really weird\u2026\u2019 But I was fine. It\u2019s hard not to think the worst. It\u2019s hard to think you\u2019re overtired, or you\u2019ve been on Instagram too long, and to realise these might have the same side-effects as something deadly. But the charity evolves with me. I use it. Here\u2019s something else that I feel: maybe someone else feels the same way.\u201d She talks about the summer just gone with a regretful kind of wonder \u2013 it was th e summer after the Game of Thrones finale had divided fans, when she was coming to terms with how the \u201coverwhelming\u201d amount of nudity in the first season had affected her. And, after years of \u201cfilling every hiatus with a movie, shit, good or otherwise\u201d (she starred opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Genisys, and as Qi\u2019ra in Solo: a Star Wars Story) she had decided to take a break. Or, the decision was made for her. \u201cAfter we did the premiere for the last season, it felt suddenly like I lost all of the bones in my body. And I was in this puddle on the floor going, \u2018Maybe this isn\u2019t just the show.\u2019 I\u2019d never wanted to look around and see what we had, because I was convinced it was just going to blow up in our faces. And, well, at the end it kind of did. So I kept my head down. Then, after the premiere, I finally was able to stop, and that was difficult.\u201d She travelled and went \u201craving with my mates, but that was not fulfilling. So, bloated and exhausted I went away for two weeks with my best girlfriend, [The Good Fight star] Rose Leslie, and it was in this retreat in India that I suddenly got it. This is what stopping feels like. And I was able to finally\u2026 be kind to myself.\u201d All this is recent. All this is really recent, with a new understanding of grief. Her beloved father, a theatre sound engineer, died of cancer in 2016. \u201cThe world felt like a scarier place once my dad wasn\u2019t in it,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cThere was the referendum, too,\u201d she shudders. \u201cIt was the year of everything bad.\u201d But it was after her lost summer that, \u201cI finally got this feeling. As if, on a cellular level, I\u2019d grown up. And it\u2019s so bittersweet, because I was clinging on to that childlike optimism. Then, when I finally let it go, I realised that was actually quite a heavy backpack to be wearing. I felt like that at the Emmys, too, finally popping my head up from the bunker. It\u2019s as if you can see the actual landscape that you\u2019ve been living in this entire time from another perspective.\u201d Occasionally she looks at me apologetically, her eyebrows like arrows, to check she\u2019s not saying too much, and then she continues. \u201cIt can be perceived as such a feminine trait, can\u2019t it \u2013 the responsibility to \u2018put a smile on it\u2019. And, and you feel like it\u2019s a defeat if you give in and admit, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s not going to be OK in the end.\u2019 But then, if you do, then you have an opportunity to go\u2026 \u2018and what if that\u2019s all right?\u2019 Death is shit,\u201d she says, dramatically. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard and grief is horrific, and yet it is completely and utterly guaranteed. No matter how much Silicon Valley boys want to prove to everyone it\u2019s not. But the finality of death, the absolute certainty of it, I\u2019ve realised, is such a tonic.\u201d Along with a good stroke, I add the loss of a parent to her list of recommendations. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not recommending it to anyone, obviously. But it is something real you can actually hold on to. We don\u2019t look at grief properly. I\u2019m not talking about the random moments of completely overwhelming emotion, I\u2019m pretty in control of that\u2026 there was only one time on set where I just physically couldn\u2019t stop crying. It\u2019s the other stuff that we don\u2019t discuss \u2013 the functional grief; when your worldview and your perspective on life and yourself changes irrevocably, forever.\u201d How is she dealing with that? \u201cBy realising that there is a framework that life lives within, and knowing when you reach the edges of it. There\u2019s that. And I try to use the shit feelings as opposed to just \u2018breathing through it\u2019. It\u2019s like putting my plastic in the recycling bin \u2013 it might not do anything, but I should at least try.

Larger countries that either dislike any moves towards further integration (step forward, Hungary) or commonly offer discounted rates of tax to foreign investors (among them the Czech Republic, Austria and Sweden) also joined the opposition.</p> <p>This battle is being played out alongside a bloody skirmish over an EU-wide digital services tax, which has very similar international companies in its sights and has generated a backlash from the same club of nations (let\u2019s call them the tax discounters).</p> <p>On both tax reporting and a digital tax, right is on the commission\u2019s side. It knows the EU is being played by a powerful group of US tech companies, from Google and Facebook to Microsoft and Oracle, that have grown quickly to be among the largest companies in the world without making much of a contribution towards the upkeep of the nations they sell to.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s economy is at the extreme end of a spectrum of tax discounters, as the government\u2019s independent tax budget oversight body <a href=\"https://static.rasset.ie/documents/news/2019/11/fiscal-assessment-report-november-2019-website.pdf\" title=\"\">admitted last week</a>. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac) said it was concerned that the country\u2019s economy had become so reliant on duties paid by multinationals that half of all the country\u2019s corporate taxes come from just 10 global companies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are too many influential countries that are now utterly dependent on being tax discounters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So important is corporation tax to Dublin that it now accounts for one in every five euros of tax collected by the Irish government. Tellingly, Ifac warned Ireland\u2019s treasury that between \u20ac2bn and \u20ac6bn of the \u20ac10bn total corporate tax take could be considered \u201cexcess\u201d. This money would be vulnerable to moves by the EU and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \u2013 a thinktank backed by developed economies \u2013 to prevent profit-shifting to low-tax countries. It defined excess as \u201cbeyond what would be expected based on the economy\u2019s underlying performance and historical and international norms\u201d.</p> <p>Without its offer of a corporation tax rate of 12.5%, which is reduced to 6.25% for profits linked to a company\u2019s patent or intellectual property, Ireland\u2019s politicians believe the government\u2019s finances would be much diminished. That\u2019s why it signed a sweetheart tax deal several years ago with Apple worth \u20ac14bn that an EU court ruling found to be unlawful. And it is also why Dublin and Apple appealed against that ruling.</p> <p>There needs to be common agreement to tackle abuses by multinational companies, which increasingly become titans in their sector without ever paying much corporate tax. But what Ireland\u2019s story tells us is that too many influential countries are now utterly dependent on being tax discounters.</p> <p>They need to be compensated in some way to ease them through a transition period, otherwise they are never going to vote for a common rulebook. That\u2019s the next step for Germany and France: to come up with a roadmap and not just a change in the rules.</p> <p>If the commission is correct and its plan would generate billions more in tax, then much of this revenue needs to be recycled, at least in the early years, back to the likes of Malta, Cyprus and Ireland.</p> <p>These countries need a carrot and not just a stick, because beating them up with arguments about fairness isn\u2019t working. </p> <h2>Strikes and fare rises herald the start of a turbulent period for rail</h2> <p>If nothing else, rail unions may have focused busy commuters\u2019 minds on Christmas Day: that\u2019s the next time the hundreds of thousands of people who rely on South Western Railway can expect a normal timetable. And, of course, no trains run on that day.</p> <p>From Monday, another excruciating chapter opens in that most opaque of industrial disputes spreading around Britain\u2019s railways: the row over the role and responsibilities of guards on trains, and whether their jobs and status will really be preserved. Now the dispute with the RMT union is entering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/21/south-western-announces-month-rail-strikes\" title=\"\">a full month of strikes</a> on a vital commuter network that runs into London Waterloo.</p> <p>Sympathy for unions is likely to be in short supply among those squeezing on to an even more crowded rush-hour train \u2013 if available \u2013 heading through the blue belt of Tory shires.</p> <p>Rail workers are generally well remunerated \u2013 thanks in no small part to the efforts of the unions. The RMT is vigilant in guarding its flank against any incursions: in this case the implications of driver-only operation. However sincere the words of train operators may be in promising a future for their guards, the broader context is a rail industry desperately seeking cost savings.</p> <p>As confirmation of January fare rises landed on Saturday, again zooming merrily ahead of inflation, the bottom line hove firmly back into view \u2013 not just for train operators, but punters footing the bill. Season ticket sales on South Western have plummeted \u2013 testament to changing working habits, but perhaps also to increased public reluctance to commit to a daily ride on a network which does not repay that trust.</p> <p>The bitter words suggests this latest battle may not be resolved soon. But it is difficult to see how the RMT can win the war by demanding that nothing change in a world where everything else is rapidly doing so.</p> <h2>Mini-bonds can mean maxi losses. The FCA must get tough</h2> <p>Financial regulators are often criticised for closing doors long after investors\u2019 money has bolted. But in the case of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/26/fca-to-ban-promotion-of-mini-bonds-to-small-investors\" title=\"\">ban on mini-bond sales</a> imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority last week, it really is a case of too little, too late.</p> <p>It is now eight months since it emerged that more than 11,000 investors might have lost up to 80% of their money in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/29/one-of-the-biggest-financial-scandals-around-fca-criticised-over-lcf\" title=\"\">\u00a3236m bond failure at London Capital &amp; Finance.</a> Since then more mini-bonds have been sold to a gullible public, and more money will be lost.</p> <p>The problem is that mini-bonds are too damn seductive. Promotional literature for these products is littered with phrases such as \u201cIsa-able\u201d and \u201cguaranteed\u201d, giving the impression that the money is safe, and that if it can go into an Isa, it must have the stamp of approval from the government.</p> <p>No such approval exists, and there is no financial compensation scheme to pick up the pieces when these highly speculative investments collapse, which they do with unnerving frequency.</p> <p>As long ago as September 2015, the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s sister paper, the <em>Guardian</em>, warned its readers: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2015/sep/05/independent-portfolio-managers-ipm-mini-bond-losses\" title=\"\">\u201cIf you see something promoted as a \u2018mini-bond\u2019, bin it!\u201d.</a> It was evident even then that the overenthusiastic promises and, in some cases, bogus \u201csecurity\u201d guarantees were ensnaring small investors and leading to hefty losses.</p> <p>Even today the \u201cban\u201d is not quite as it seems. The FCA, despite facing a serious rebuke from an independent investigator for its handling of LC&amp;F, has been excessively timid in its response. Each mini-bond will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The outright ban will apply only to more complex mini-bonds (those investing in properties or other companies), and not to bonds used to raise money for the investment company\u2019s own activities.</p> <p>The inevitable result is that mini-bonds will continue to offer unlikely interest rates \u2013 and to appear at the top of internet searches for high returns on savings.</p>",

Larger countries that either dislike any moves towards further integration (step forward, Hungary) or commonly offer discounted rates of tax to foreign investors (among them the Czech Republic, Austria and Sweden) also joined the opposition. This battle is being played out alongside a bloody skirmish over an EU-wide digital services tax, which has very similar international companies in its sights and has generated a backlash from the same club of nations (let\u2019s call them the tax discounters). On both tax reporting and a digital tax, right is on the commission\u2019s side. It knows the EU is being played by a powerful group of US tech companies, from Google and Facebook to Microsoft and Oracle, that have grown quickly to be among the largest companies in the world without making much of a contribution towards the upkeep of the nations they sell to. Ireland\u2019s economy is at the extreme end of a spectrum of tax discounters, as the government\u2019s independent tax budget oversight body admitted last week. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac) said it was concerned that the country\u2019s economy had become so reliant on duties paid by multinationals that half of all the country\u2019s corporate taxes come from just 10 global companies. So important is corporation tax to Dublin that it now accounts for one in every five euros of tax collected by the Irish government. Tellingly, Ifac warned Ireland\u2019s treasury that between \u20ac2bn and \u20ac6bn of the \u20ac10bn total corporate tax take could be considered \u201cexcess\u201d. This money would be vulnerable to moves by the EU and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \u2013 a thinktank backed by developed economies \u2013 to prevent profit-shifting to low-tax countries. It defined excess as \u201cbeyond what would be expected based on the economy\u2019s underlying performance and historical and international norms\u201d. Without its offer of a corporation tax rate of 12.5%, which is reduced to 6.25% for profits linked to a company\u2019s patent or intellectual property, Ireland\u2019s politicians believe the government\u2019s finances would be much diminished. That\u2019s why it signed a sweetheart tax deal several years ago with Apple worth \u20ac14bn that an EU court ruling found to be unlawful. And it is also why Dublin and Apple appealed against that ruling. There needs to be common agreement to tackle abuses by multinational companies, which increasingly become titans in their sector without ever paying much corporate tax. But what Ireland\u2019s story tells us is that too many influential countries are now utterly dependent on being tax discounters. They need to be compensated in some way to ease them through a transition period, otherwise they are never going to vote for a common rulebook. That\u2019s the next step for Germany and France: to come up with a roadmap and not just a change in the rules. If the commission is correct and its plan would generate billions more in tax, then much of this revenue needs to be recycled, at least in the early years, back to the likes of Malta, Cyprus and Ireland. These countries need a carrot and not just a stick, because beating them up with arguments about fairness isn\u2019t working. Strikes and fare rises herald the start of a turbulent period for rail If nothing else, rail unions may have focused busy commuters\u2019 minds on Christmas Day: that\u2019s the next time the hundreds of thousands of people who rely on South Western Railway can expect a normal timetable. And, of course, no trains run on that day. From Monday, another excruciating chapter opens in that most opaque of industrial disputes spreading around Britain\u2019s railways: the row over the role and responsibilities of guards on trains, and whether their jobs and status will really be preserved. Now the dispute with the RMT union is entering a full month of strikes on a vital commuter network that runs into London Waterloo. Sympathy for unions is likely to be in short supply among those squeezing on to an even more crowded rush-hour train \u2013 if available \u2013 heading through the blue belt of Tory shires. Rail workers are generally well remunerated \u2013 thanks in no small part to the efforts of the unions. The RMT is vigilant in guarding its flank against any incursions: in this case the implications of driver-only operation. However sincere the words of train operators may be in promising a future for their guards, the broader context is a rail industry desperately seeking cost savings. As confirmation of January fare rises landed on Saturday, again zooming merrily ahead of inflation, the bottom line hove firmly back into view \u2013 not just for train operators, but punters footing the bill. Season ticket sales on South Western have plummeted \u2013 testament to changing working habits, but perhaps also to increased public reluctance to commit to a daily ride on a network which does not repay that trust. The bitter words suggests this latest battle may not be resolved soon. But it is difficult to see how the RMT can win the war by demanding that nothing change in a world where everything else is rapidly doing so. Mini-bonds can mean maxi losses. The FCA must get tough Financial regulators are often criticised for closing doors long after investors\u2019 money has bolted. But in the case of the ban on mini-bond sales imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority last week, it really is a case of too little, too late. It is now eight months since it emerged that more than 11,000 investors might have lost up to 80% of their money in a \u00a3236m bond failure at London Capital &amp; Finance. Since then more mini-bonds have been sold to a gullible public, and more money will be lost. The problem is that mini-bonds are too damn seductive. Promotional literature for these products is littered with phrases such as \u201cIsa-able\u201d and \u201cguaranteed\u201d, giving the impression that the money is safe, and that if it can go into an Isa, it must have the stamp of approval from the government. No such approval exists, and there is no financial compensation scheme to pick up the pieces when these highly speculative investments collapse, which they do with unnerving frequency. As long ago as September 2015, the Observer\u2019s sister paper, the Guardian, warned its readers: \u201cIf you see something promoted as a \u2018mini-bond\u2019, bin it!\u201d. It was evident even then that the overenthusiastic promises and, in some cases, bogus \u201csecurity\u201d guarantees were ensnaring small investors and leading to hefty losses. Even today the \u201cban\u201d is not quite as it seems. The FCA, despite facing a serious rebuke from an independent investigator for its handling of LC&amp;F, has been excessively timid in its response. Each mini-bond will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The outright ban will apply only to more complex mini-bonds (those investing in properties or other companies), and not to bonds used to raise money for the investment company\u2019s own activities. The inevitable result is that mini-bonds will continue to offer unlikely interest rates \u2013 and to appear at the top of internet searches for high returns on savings.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cGet over it\u201d: that is how Mick Mulvaney, acting chief of staff at the White House, dismissed evidence that his boss bribed a foreign government to publicise bogus charges against his chief political rival. But it\u2019s about as easy to get over Trump as it is to shrug off a cancer diagnosis. With Hillary Clinton archly hinting at her readiness for a rerun of the 2016 election, others are reinterpreting the past either to delegitimise Trump after the event or to prepare for his vindication at the polls next November.</p> <p>A weary, regretful deja vu pervades <strong>Crime in Progress,</strong> written by the researchers who brought to light the notorious dossier that traced Trump\u2019s grubby dealings with Russian gangsters; the same document described a cabaret act supposedly staged for him by some micturating Moscow hookers, commended by Putin as \u201cthe best in the world\u201d. Simpson and Fritsch hoped the FBI would use the information they provided to indict Trump, though its then director James Comey instead reprimanded Clinton for her insecure email server. They were disappointed a second time by the noncommittal Mueller report. This \u201csecret history\u201d of their persecution by angry Republicans who disputed their findings attempts to relitigate the case.</p> <p>Simpson and Fritsch aspire to be latter-day versions of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the reporters who exposed Nixon\u2019s Watergate cover-up: their book opens with Fritsch sneakily foiling Bernstein\u2019s appeal for information, and later Simpson derides Woodward for cosying up to Trump. But the new guys lack the crusading bravado of their predecessors. Their opposition to Trump starts out as a \u201cbusiness opportunity\u201d, not a quest for truth or a challenge to power, and they go to work like conscientious geeks, assisted by a man they call \u201ca human hard drive\u201d and a woman who serves as their \u201cin-house cyber-ninja\u201d.</p> <p>The retold tale is revved up by hyperactive verbs \u2013 Simpson \u201ccracks open\u201d his MacBook, \u201cpops\u201d a beer can, and \u201cshoots\u201d a text message to Fritsch \u2013 and includes a strained homage to the episodes in <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/all-the-president-s-men-9781416527572.html\" title=\"\">All the President\u2019s Men</a> </em>when Woodward ventures into an underground car park for creepy confabs with the CIA informant he nicknamed \u201cDeep Throat\u201d: summoned to testify at the US Capitol, Simpson and Fritsch are ushered into \u201ca dimly lit chamber\u201d in the basement where poor lighting gives their Republican inquisitor \u201ca lizard-like appearance\u201d, then sequestered in another office that feels \u201clike a weird terrarium out of a sci-fi movie\u201d. Yet there is no \u201ccathartic finale\u201d to match Nixon\u2019s fall, and the ominous title of <em>Crime in Progress</em> deflates when the authors admit that Trump\u2019s \u201cconspiring with Russia may not be a crime provable in federal court\u201d.</p> <p>Last year an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/22/new-york-times-anonymous-op-ed-trump-book-a-warning\" title=\"\">unidentified White House official wrote an op-ed in the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/22/new-york-times-anonymous-op-ed-trump-book-a-warning\" title=\"\">New York Times</a> </em>about the efforts of aides to frustrate the president\u2019s most \u201cbatshit\u201d proposals. Trump denounced the article as an act of treason, but because his only means of self-defence is name-calling, he had trouble mocking his nameless detractor. At a rally in Montana \u201cAnonymous\u201d got entangled with \u201cAnomalous\u201d on his flapping tongue and, after some slurs and gobbles that suggested dodgy dentures, the compound word expired in a sibilant whistle. In <strong>A Warning </strong>the op-ed\u2019s covert author accuses the president of mental instability; I suppose his inarticulacy is the least of our worries.</p> <p>Like Simpson and Fritsch, Anonymous reels through Trump\u2019s outrages all over again, adding a few new charges, among them a scheme to sabotage the rule of law by abolishing federal judges. Though <em>A Warning </em>traffics in scandal, its tone is classically lofty, with tributes to noble Romans such as Cicero and pious epigraphs from America\u2019s founding fathers.

      "bodyText": "\u201cGet over it\u201d: that is how Mick Mulvaney, acting chief of staff at the White House, dismissed evidence that his boss bribed a foreign government to publicise bogus charges against his chief political rival. But it\u2019s about as easy to get over Trump as it is to shrug off a cancer diagnosis. With Hillary Clinton archly hinting at her readiness for a rerun of the 2016 election, others are reinterpreting the past either to delegitimise Trump after the event or to prepare for his vindication at the polls next November. A weary, regretful deja vu pervades Crime in Progress, written by the researchers who brought to light the notorious dossier that traced Trump\u2019s grubby dealings with Russian gangsters; the same document described a cabaret act supposedly staged for him by some micturating Moscow hookers, commended by Putin as \u201cthe best in the world\u201d. Simpson and Fritsch hoped the FBI would use the information they provided to indict Trump, though its then director James Comey instead reprimanded Clinton for her insecure email server. They were disappointed a second time by the noncommittal Mueller report. This \u201csecret history\u201d of their persecution by angry Republicans who disputed their findings attempts to relitigate the case. Simpson and Fritsch aspire to be latter-day versions of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the reporters who exposed Nixon\u2019s Watergate cover-up: their book opens with Fritsch sneakily foiling Bernstein\u2019s appeal for information, and later Simpson derides Woodward for cosying up to Trump. But the new guys lack the crusading bravado of their predecessors. Their opposition to Trump starts out as a \u201cbusiness opportunity\u201d, not a quest for truth or a challenge to power, and they go to work like conscientious geeks, assisted by a man they call \u201ca human hard drive\u201d and a woman who serves as their \u201cin-house cyber-ninja\u201d. The retold tale is revved up by hyperactive verbs \u2013 Simpson \u201ccracks open\u201d his MacBook, \u201cpops\u201d a beer can, and \u201cshoots\u201d a text message to Fritsch \u2013 and includes a strained homage to the episodes in All the President\u2019s Men when Woodward ventures into an underground car park for creepy confabs with the CIA informant he nicknamed \u201cDeep Throat\u201d: summoned to testify at the US Capitol, Simpson and Fritsch are ushered into \u201ca dimly lit chamber\u201d in the basement where poor lighting gives their Republican inquisitor \u201ca lizard-like appearance\u201d, then sequestered in another office that feels \u201clike a weird terrarium out of a sci-fi movie\u201d. Yet there is no \u201ccathartic finale\u201d to match Nixon\u2019s fall, and the ominous title of Crime in Progress deflates when the authors admit that Trump\u2019s \u201cconspiring with Russia may not be a crime provable in federal court\u201d. Last year an unidentified White House official wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about the efforts of aides to frustrate the president\u2019s most \u201cbatshit\u201d proposals. Trump denounced the article as an act of treason, but because his only means of self-defence is name-calling, he had trouble mocking his nameless detractor. At a rally in Montana \u201cAnonymous\u201d got entangled with \u201cAnomalous\u201d on his flapping tongue and, after some slurs and gobbles that suggested dodgy dentures, the compound word expired in a sibilant whistle. In A Warning the op-ed\u2019s covert author accuses the president of mental instability; I suppose his inarticulacy is the least of our worries. Like Simpson and Fritsch, Anonymous reels through Trump\u2019s outrages all over again, adding a few new charges, among them a scheme to sabotage the rule of law by abolishing federal judges. Though A Warning traffics in scandal, its tone is classically lofty, with tributes to noble Romans such as Cicero and pious epigraphs from America\u2019s founding fathers. Anonymity is presented as a selfless patriotic virtue: the writer challenges Trump on principle, not as a disgruntled individual \u2013 but now that others are openly testifying to Congress, this impersonality could just as well be deemed a form of moral cowardice. A Warning ends by saluting the passengers who stormed the cockpit of a hijacked plane on 9/11, knowing they would die but hoping to prevent the terrorists from reaching their target in Washington. Anonymous, however, is no martyr: he or she hopes to survive. How different is this duplicity from the craven writhings of Mulvaney, who once called the president he now serves \u201ca terrible human being\u201d? On his first day in office, after a squabble about crowd size at his inauguration, Trump demanded a phenomenological adjustment. \u201cTruth and reality\u201d, as Simpson and Fritsch put it, were replaced by Kellyanne Conway\u2019s \u201calternative facts\u201d, AKA falsehoods. \u201cThe Trump story,\u201d adds Anonymous, \u201cis briskly moving into a fictional universe.\u201d Doug Wead\u2019s Inside Trump\u2019s White House goes further, advancing to enraptured fantasy. Wead, a veteran Republican toady, acclaims Trump for \u201cthe magic of thinking big\u201d; his own padded, puffy volume is an exercise in magical thinking. Like a sun king freshly solarised on the tanning bed, Wead\u2019s Trump radiates \u201cbeauty and intellect\u201d. His sons are \u201cwell groomed\u201d, his daughters \u201cstatuesque\u201d, and his consort bends down from her spike-heeled altitude to \u201creach out to the suffering\u201d. While Melania is cast as a stilettoed Madonna, Trump functions as a universal paterfamilias. \u201cIt\u2019s a father thing,\u201d smarms Jared Kushner to explain Kim Jong-un\u2019s attachment to Trump: Kim\u2019s actual begetter was a maniacal despot, so the chubby ogre has chosen a fitting surrogate. Acclaimed by Wead as the creator of his own \u201cimmortal brand\u201d, a lucrative logo that is \u201cetched into the marble of history\u201d, Trump the mass-market Midas dispenses product placements at every turn.

There Giuliani built a reputation for taking on mob bosses and aggressively prosecuting the kind of criminal activity he now stands accused of.</p> <p>\u201cMe ending up in jail?\u201d Giuliani told the <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/25/rudy-giuliani-trump-impeachment-hearing/\">celebrity gossip site TMZ</a> at a Washington airport on Monday. \u201cFifty years of being a lawyer, 50 years of ethical, dedicated practice of the law, probably have prosecuted more criminals of a high level than any US attorney in history. I think I follow the law very carefully. I think the people pursuing me are desperate, sad, angry, disappointing liars. They\u2019re hurting their country. And I\u2019m ashamed of them.\u201d</p> <p>But in no version of events does Giuliani appear not to be in big trouble.</p> <p>The immediate source of his current problems is the work he did in Ukraine over the last two years for himself and on behalf of Trump, who instructed the Ukrainian president to speak to Giuliani in a 25 July phone call.</p> <p>Giuliani wanted the Ukrainians to announce an investigation of Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s chief political rival, according to US officials who testified in the impeachment hearings. In pursuit of his errand, Giuliani contacted current and former Ukrainian prosecutors, multiple Ukrainian presidential administrations and multiple Ukrainian oligarchs, according to testimony.</p> <p>Prosecutors are investigating whether Giuliani offered the oligarchs help with their problems with the US justice department in exchange for help with his project to harm Biden, a charge Giuliani has denied.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca922e4d3c97ba236e8a6ccbabb68d2a84e54be6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca922e4d3c97ba236e8a6ccbabb68d2a84e54be6/0_239_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lev Parnas, left, and Igor Fruman sit either side of lawyer Todd Blanche during their arraignment in New York City on 23 October 23.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rudy Giuliani\u2019s business associates Lev Parnas, left, and Igor Fruman sit either side of lawyer during their arraignment in New York City on 23 October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Rosenberg/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two Soviet Union-born American associates of Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested last month on campaign finance charges, and Parnas is cooperating with investigators. Alongside the prosecutors in New York, the US justice department in Washington is also investigating Giuliani\u2019s conduct, as is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p> <p>Congress is also after Giuliani, who came in for sharp public criticism in the impeachment hearings earlier this month, when Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch described a smear campaign Giuliani had mounted against her, allegedly because as an anti-corruption advocate she stood in the way of Trump\u2019s Ukraine scheme.</p> <p>\u201cI do not understand Mr Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me,\u201d Yovanovitch testified. \u201cWhat I can say is that Mr Giuliani should have known those claims were suspect, coming as they reportedly did from individuals with questionable motives and with reason to believe that their political and financial ambitions would be stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d</p> <p>As the pressure on him has intensified, Giuliani\u2019s antics in his own defense have grown increasingly animated. He warned last week that he had collected information that would put his political enemies on their heels.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m also going to bring out a pay-for-play scheme in the Obama administration that will be devastating to the Democrat party,\u201d Giuliani <a href=\"https://twitter.com/M2Madness/status/1198291069659684865\">told Fox News</a>. </p> <p>He even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/preetbharara/status/1194337641778548736?lang=en\">threatened</a> to start an impeachment podcast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c5fa3c6d594d2c715bc43c9c52fcd7f65ba8903\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c5fa3c6d594d2c715bc43c9c52fcd7f65ba8903/0_0_2532_1519/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giuliani on Trump: \u2018We are friends for twenty-nine29 years and nothing will interfere with that.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giuliani on Trump: \u2018We are friends for twenty-nine29 years and nothing will interfere with that.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But what matters most for Giuliani right now is his long friendship with Trump, his most powerful protector, which goes back to the late 1980s, when Trump served as co-chair of Giuliani\u2019s first fundraiser for his 1989 mayoral campaign, <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/wayne-barrett-donald-trump-rudy-giuliani-peas-pod-article-1.2776357\">according to Wayne Barrett</a>, who has written books about both men.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/14/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-insurance-loyal\">telephone interview with the Guardian</a>, in response to a question about whether he was nervous that <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-impeachment-republicans-rudy-giuliani-f192d64d-2bee-4597-8de8-3e0477b988de.html\">Trump might \u201cthrow him under a bus\u201d in the impeachment crisis</a>, Giuliani said: \u201cI\u2019m not, but I do have very, very good insurance, so if he does, all my hospital bills will be paid.\u201d</p> <p>Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Robert Costello, who was also on the call, then interjected: \u201cHe\u2019s joking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are friends for 29 years and nothing will interfere with that,\u201d Giuliani told TMZ of Trump. \u201cThe president knows that everything I did, I did to help him.

The net tightened again last week when it emerged a grand jury had issued a broad subpoena for documents relating to Giuliani\u2019s international consulting business as part of an investigation of alleged crimes including money laundering, wire fraud, campaign finance violations, making false statements, obstruction of justice, and violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. \u201cWe who admired him for so long expected much more from Rudy Giuliani and his legacy,\u201d Ken Frydman, a former Giuliani press secretary, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece last month. \u201c\u2018America\u2019s Mayor,\u2019 as Rudy was called after September 11, is today President Trump\u2019s bumbling personal lawyer and henchman, his apologist and defender of the indefensible.\u201d Giuliani has denied wrongdoing and scoffed at the notion he is in any legal jeopardy \u2013 particularly from federal prosecutors in the southern district of New York, an office he once led as a star US attorney during Ronald Reagan\u2019s first term. There Giuliani built a reputation for taking on mob bosses and aggressively prosecuting the kind of criminal activity he now stands accused of. \u201cMe ending up in jail?\u201d Giuliani told the celebrity gossip site TMZ at a Washington airport on Monday. \u201cFifty years of being a lawyer, 50 years of ethical, dedicated practice of the law, probably have prosecuted more criminals of a high level than any US attorney in history. I think I follow the law very carefully. I think the people pursuing me are desperate, sad, angry, disappointing liars. They\u2019re hurting their country. And I\u2019m ashamed of them.\u201d But in no version of events does Giuliani appear not to be in big trouble. The immediate source of his current problems is the work he did in Ukraine over the last two years for himself and on behalf of Trump, who instructed the Ukrainian president to speak to Giuliani in a 25 July phone call. Giuliani wanted the Ukrainians to announce an investigation of Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s chief political rival, according to US officials who testified in the impeachment hearings. In pursuit of his errand, Giuliani contacted current and former Ukrainian prosecutors, multiple Ukrainian presidential administrations and multiple Ukrainian oligarchs, according to testimony. Prosecutors are investigating whether Giuliani offered the oligarchs help with their problems with the US justice department in exchange for help with his project to harm Biden, a charge Giuliani has denied. Two Soviet Union-born American associates of Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested last month on campaign finance charges, and Parnas is cooperating with investigators. Alongside the prosecutors in New York, the US justice department in Washington is also investigating Giuliani\u2019s conduct, as is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Congress is also after Giuliani, who came in for sharp public criticism in the impeachment hearings earlier this month, when Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch described a smear campaign Giuliani had mounted against her, allegedly because as an anti-corruption advocate she stood in the way of Trump\u2019s Ukraine scheme. \u201cI do not understand Mr Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me,\u201d Yovanovitch testified. \u201cWhat I can say is that Mr Giuliani should have known those claims were suspect, coming as they reportedly did from individuals with questionable motives and with reason to believe that their political and financial ambitions would be stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d As the pressure on him has intensified, Giuliani\u2019s antics in his own defense have grown increasingly animated. He warned last week that he had collected information that would put his political enemies on their heels. \u201cI\u2019m also going to bring out a pay-for-play scheme in the Obama administration that will be devastating to the Democrat party,\u201d Giuliani told Fox News. He even threatened to start an impeachment podcast. But what matters most for Giuliani right now is his long friendship with Trump, his most powerful protector, which goes back to the late 1980s, when Trump served as co-chair of Giuliani\u2019s first fundraiser for his 1989 mayoral campaign, according to Wayne Barrett, who has written books about both men. In a telephone interview with the Guardian, in response to a question about whether he was nervous that Trump might \u201cthrow him under a bus\u201d in the impeachment crisis, Giuliani said: \u201cI\u2019m not, but I do have very, very good insurance, so if he does, all my hospital bills will be paid.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Robert Costello, who was also on the call, then interjected: \u201cHe\u2019s joking.\u201d \u201cWe are friends for 29 years and nothing will interfere with that,\u201d Giuliani told TMZ of Trump. \u201cThe president knows that everything I did, I did to help him. And he knows it. I did it honorably. I did it legally. I did it in a way that it will embarrass the people who are pursuing me and have nowhere near the integrity and honor that I have.\u201d Trump has tweeted that Giuliani \u201cmay seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer\u201d. In an interview with disgraced former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly last Tuesday, however, Trump distanced himself from Giuliani. Analysts watching Giuliani\u2019s case expect that an indictment could be handed down at any moment, raising the prospect of America\u2019s Mayor in handcuffs. \u201cIf Rudy\u2019s story ends the way it feels like it\u2019s going to end,\u201d wrote Evan Mandery, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and veteran of New York City political campaigns, \u201cit\u2019s not plausible for anyone who knows or has studied him to say they never saw it coming.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>That Usman Khan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/london-bridge-terror-attack\" title=\"\">killed two people</a> having been released from prison under licence for terrorist offences has raised a flurry of urgent questions concerning public safety and prisoner supervision.</p> <p>The most pressing is why Khan, who was jailed in 2012 for his part in an al-Qaida-inspired plot to bomb high-profile locations and build a terrorist training camp in Pakistan, was freed in the first place.</p> <p>Khan, along with two other men from Stoke-on-Trent and several from London and Cardiff, was accused of targeting the London Stock Exchange, the Houses of Parliament and the US embassy, as well as several religious and political figures.</p> <p>But Khan, then 20, admitted to a lesser charge \u2013 engaging in conduct for the preparation of terrorism. The court heard that he had been secretly recorded talking about plans to recruit UK radicals to attend a training camp in Kashmir.</p> <p>Along with another man, he was given an indeterminate public protection sentence (IPP) and was told that he would serve at least eight years in prison.</p> <p>Passing sentence, judge Mr Justice Wilkie said Khan and others had been involved in a \u201cserious, long-term venture in terrorism\u201d that could also have resulted in atrocities being carried out in Britain.</p> <p>\u201cIt was envisaged by them all that ultimately they and the other recruits may return to the UK as trained and experienced terrorists available to perform terrorist attacks in this country,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But the IPP sentence, which ends only when the Parole Board considers that an offender no longer poses a risk to the public, was quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2013. At the time many politicians and penal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/may/19/prisoners-challenge-indeterminate-sentences-supreme-court\" title=\"\">reform campaigners</a> feared such sentences were resulting in prisoners unjustly spending too long in jail, and they were being abolished.</p> <p>At his appeal Khan\u2019s legal team claimed that he was a young man whose ambition was to bring sharia law to Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and that it was \u201chighly unrealistic to suppose that the authorities in Pakistan would allow a teenager from Stoke to impose sharia law or run a training school for terrorists\u201d.</p> <p>One of the appeal judges, Lord Justice Leveson, acknowledged that there was \u201cno doubt that anyone convicted of this type of offence could legitimately be considered dangerous\u201d but replaced Khan\u2019s IPP sentence with a 16-year determinate sentence.</p> <p>Prisoners are usually released halfway through such sentences, but Khan had served less than seven years when he was freed on licence in December last year and ordered to wear a tag.

      "bodyText": "That Usman Khan killed two people having been released from prison under licence for terrorist offences has raised a flurry of urgent questions concerning public safety and prisoner supervision. The most pressing is why Khan, who was jailed in 2012 for his part in an al-Qaida-inspired plot to bomb high-profile locations and build a terrorist training camp in Pakistan, was freed in the first place. Khan, along with two other men from Stoke-on-Trent and several from London and Cardiff, was accused of targeting the London Stock Exchange, the Houses of Parliament and the US embassy, as well as several religious and political figures. But Khan, then 20, admitted to a lesser charge \u2013 engaging in conduct for the preparation of terrorism. The court heard that he had been secretly recorded talking about plans to recruit UK radicals to attend a training camp in Kashmir. Along with another man, he was given an indeterminate public protection sentence (IPP) and was told that he would serve at least eight years in prison. Passing sentence, judge Mr Justice Wilkie said Khan and others had been involved in a \u201cserious, long-term venture in terrorism\u201d that could also have resulted in atrocities being carried out in Britain. \u201cIt was envisaged by them all that ultimately they and the other recruits may return to the UK as trained and experienced terrorists available to perform terrorist attacks in this country,\u201d he said. But the IPP sentence, which ends only when the Parole Board considers that an offender no longer poses a risk to the public, was quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2013. At the time many politicians and penal reform campaigners feared such sentences were resulting in prisoners unjustly spending too long in jail, and they were being abolished. At his appeal Khan\u2019s legal team claimed that he was a young man whose ambition was to bring sharia law to Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and that it was \u201chighly unrealistic to suppose that the authorities in Pakistan would allow a teenager from Stoke to impose sharia law or run a training school for terrorists\u201d. One of the appeal judges, Lord Justice Leveson, acknowledged that there was \u201cno doubt that anyone convicted of this type of offence could legitimately be considered dangerous\u201d but replaced Khan\u2019s IPP sentence with a 16-year determinate sentence. Prisoners are usually released halfway through such sentences, but Khan had served less than seven years when he was freed on licence in December last year and ordered to wear a tag. His time spent in custody before he was sentenced would have been taken into account, according to legal experts. In the aftermath of the tragedy, politicians on all sides have claimed that the sentencing and supervision regime applied to terrorists needs revisiting. Boris Johnson said it was important to \u201cenforce the appropriate sentences for dangerous criminals, especially for terrorists\u201d. Security minister Brandon Lewis said: \u201cI think it is right that we do have to look again at the sentences \u2026 around these violent crimes.\u201d Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he, too, was concerned that IPP sentences had been scrapped, and also raised the issue of people being released on licence. \u201cDoes the Ministry of Justice, does the probation service have the powers and resources to properly supervise people who are clearly dangerous?\u201d Khan asked. However, Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, cautioned against a kneejerk reaction from politicians. \u201cThe IPP sentence was abolished because many low- and no-risk people were left languishing in prison, sometimes for years. The pursuit of total security will only ever result in multiple injustices. We need to learn the lessons from any failings of supervision in this particular case, and do a lot more to address the causes of extremism.\u201d Chris Phillips, a former head of the UK National Counter Terrorism Security Office, warned that convicted terrorists were being released when still radicalised. \u201cWe\u2019re playing Russian roulette with people\u2019s lives, letting convicted, known, radicalised jihadi criminals walk about our streets,\u201d Phillips said. The Observer understands that although Khan was not considered high risk, he was seen by probation twice a week. There was nothing in his pattern of behaviour prior to the attacks that suggested his risk profile had changed. As is mandatory for convicted terrorists, he was on the government\u2019s Desistance and Disengagement deradicalisation programme and was attending a conference on prisoner rehabilitation, organised by the University of Cambridge, when he is alleged to have stabbed two people to death. The conference, held at London\u2019s Fishmongers\u2019 Hall, was to celebrate five years of the Learning Together initiative, and was an invitation-only event. Founded by two academics, Drs Amy Ludlow and Ruth Armstrong, the initiative has been widely praised by penal reformers. \u201cThey wanted to get academics out of ivory towers,\u201d said one justice campaigner who asked not to be named. \u201cThey wanted prisoners and criminologists to sit together in the classroom and learn together.\u201d An American idea, it has now spread across the UK, with many prisons teaming up with universities. \u201cIt would be a tragedy if what has happened has an impact on the initiative,\u201d the campaigner said. \u201cMaybe 98% of those who attend benefit from it.

So, as much as I give my spiel about these wonder ingredients, there will be some who won\u2019t budge. Most have sensitive skin and acids + sensitive skin often equals irritation. Well, these cotton pads are excellent exfoliators, sans grains and sans acids. They have been dipped in an acid alternative formulated using probiotics, natural extracts from yarrow and Japanese cedar buds. What this means in layman\u2019s terms is that they remove dead skin, brighten, reduce the appearance of pores and improve texture.

Outside, on a calm autumn day, a few diners sit at tables, soaking up what feels like the last breath of the year\u2019s warm sunshine, tucked in against the high, foliage-clad walls of the old barn. A herd of sheep and what appear to be a couple of llamas \u2013 I\u2019ve never been that great on my camelids \u2013 keep the grass short beyond the fence. The air smells sweetly of leaf mulch on the turn.</p> <p>Inside, a certain kind of England is being fed, and being fed exceptionally well; it is that part of England, to be fair, which would think it has little interest in this newspaper. And yet, here I am, on the site of one of the country\u2019s oldest vineyards, about to have a very lovely time. The late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/may/28/art.obituaries\" title=\"\">Beryl Cook</a> would have recognised some of the ladies here from her own paintings, their glasses perched just on the bridge of the nose, as they give themselves to a good lunch. The men too, for that matter. It is a place for people-watching.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6d8f7d67ddf05c665bfd4f306061bb5a355eb27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6d8f7d67ddf05c665bfd4f306061bb5a355eb27/0_819_8280_4970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Here are damsons from the estate, and whorls of a smooth, duck liver parfait and a few crushed hazelnuts\u2019: duck breast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Here are damsons from the estate, and whorls of a smooth, duck liver parfait and a few crushed hazelnuts\u2019: duck breast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ridley/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This older crowd, a lot of them now untroubled by the call of daily work, has nowhere better to be than here, inside this vaulting space, the walls traced by gnarled beams only just about managing a straight line. The art is tasteful. The paintwork, in muted tones, is tasteful. There is a cleaned, blue-black mussel shell staring at us from the bowl of snowy sea salt, the better to scoop it up. It\u2019s that kind of tasteful. Come friends, and slip gently with me into the restaurant equivalent of the bubble bath you never quite want to leave.</p> <p>I am late to this party, by about a quarter of a century. The Leaping Hare has been in the <em>Good Food Guide</em> for 25 years, and has held a Bib Gourmand, the most interesting award from the tyre company, representing good food at a reasonable price, for more than 20 years. There are hints on the menu of an awareness of the times and their passing. The word \u201cforaged\u201d appears. There are asterisks to indicate that certain dishes are made with ingredients from the estate or from within five miles of it; on others, that the key ingredients are from Norfolk or Suffolk.</p> <p>The whole \u201cdiving into hedgerows to find wild things that taste much like farmed things\u201d has never quite excited me; as I\u2019ve said before and I\u2019ll keep saying, if foraging were so great, presumably we would want everyone to be doing it. If that happened, the eco-system would collapse. Farming was a great invention. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s all irrelevant if what happens to those ingredients when they reach the kitchen misses the mark. Here, it doesn\u2019t. The cooking at the Leaping Hare isn\u2019t innovative. It\u2019s British produce, given a proper seeing to with lots of classic French bourgeois technique and an emphasis on big, crowd-pleasing flavours. You may not coo over the first mouthful. Instead, gently, as the meal goes on, you will clock just how well you are being cared for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c5dc2f1ded2b5e54e80d3a5184322b522716110\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c5dc2f1ded2b5e54e80d3a5184322b522716110/511_1301_6890_4135/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Spiced and roasted, served with golden onion rings\u2019: monkfish.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Spiced and roasted, served with golden onion rings\u2019: monkfish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ridley/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A partridge breast is seared and roasted, but there is still a crimson blush within. There\u2019s more partridge broken into the rich stew of white beans and lardons upon which it sits. A scoop of golden fried breadcrumbs, flecked with the green of herbs, is spread across the top to give it a texture. It\u2019s a lot of starter for \u00a37.95. That understanding of the need for crunch is obvious in a second starter of spiced and roasted monkfish, with golden onion rings, looking like something you could wear as a dainty bangle, speared by crisp batons of green apple. It comes on what is described simply as \u201ccurry sauce\u201d. It is the deep yellow of the best butter. It is sweet. It is only very lightly spiced. It\u2019s the perfect sauce for a coronation chicken, and lubricates the fish perfectly. It makes me laugh out loud. It\u2019s like meeting an old friend unexpectedly, after a long time separated.</p> <p>Venison, served rare enough for you to imagine you could test the blood type, comes with roasted shallots, savoy cabbage and their version of clapshot \u2013 mash mixed through with parsnip \u2013 and a rich game jus that\u2019s so shiny you could see your face in it. There are onion rings, again, for that bit of texture. They are tiny this time, as if designed for your pinkie rather than your wrist. It\u2019s also a menu that recognises the value of letting a dish give up its own secrets. Duck breast has been rendered so that there is only a thin layer of fat beneath the bronzed skin. Here are damsons from the estate, and whorls of a smooth, duck liver parfait and a few crushed hazelnuts. Here, too, is the advertised dauphinoise, served as a crisped rectangle. We are pleased to see it. But hang on, what\u2019s this in the middle? The two slabs of potato are sandwiching long-cooked then shredded duck, as if it were some savoury bourbon biscuit. It feels like you\u2019ve been lobbed a freebie. Yours for \u00a319.95.</p> <p>Their dark chocolate sorbet is good; the lip-puckering passion fruit flavour is better. Best of all is a pavlova, the meringue part fashioned through some sort of kitchen witchcraft into a cup, filled with damsons and damson ice-cream and sugared nuts for crunch. It disappears quickly. Service is of the smooth, unobtrusive kind that recognises that people eating here probably want to talk to each other, more than they wish to hear long speeches. There is a bustling caf\u00e9 down at the other end of the room, knocking out fishcakes, pasta dishes and bowls of mussels. They don\u2019t miss a beat, in either space.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d96e3117fd33e7859e369d939b94ec070d139e9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d96e3117fd33e7859e369d939b94ec070d139e9d/789_267_6815_4090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It disappears quickly\u2019: damson pavlova.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It disappears quickly\u2019: damson pavlova.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ridley/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This, of course, is a vineyard. It is only right that we drink some of what might be called their ros\u00e9, were it not the deep pink of pear drops. It is luscious, a last taste of the summer just gone. We pay up and wander into the \u201ccountry store\u201d out the back, selling picture frames and children\u2019s books, salad servers and vases and all manner of things you didn\u2019t think you needed until you saw them. Outside the breeze blows, the leaves fall and all is very much right with the world. <br></p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>My strongest memory of Maison Bleue in Bury St Edmunds, from my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/mar/01/restaurant-review-maison-bleue\">visit</a> a few years back, is of a lady in a hat, eating oysters off the half shell by herself. It was all very civilised. If anything, the offering has stepped up a notch since then. Go for the likes of crab with apple, caviar and lemon grass, or rabbit with kohlrabi and oyster ice cream, followed by halibut with a cauliflower crust and a cockle emulsion (<em><a href=\"http://www.maisonbleue.co.uk/\">maisonbleue.co.uk</a></em>).<br><br>Despite the collapse of the Jamie\u2019s Italian chain earlier this year, Jamie Oliver is pushing ahead with his mid-market restaurant interests, only outside the UK.

      "bodyText": "The Leaping Hare, Wyken Vineyards, Stanton, Suffolk IP31 2DW (01359 250 287). Starters \u00a36.95-\u00a39.95, mains \u00a314.95-\u00a329.95, desserts \u00a34.95-\u00a36.95, three-course lunch \u00a322, wines from \u00a322 The good ones have a soundtrack all of their own; a gentle hum of easy, contented chatter, with the occasional clink of cutlery on plate and bottle to glass keeping time. The Leaping Hare at Wyken Vineyards, not far from Bury St Edmunds, is one of the good ones. Outside, on a calm autumn day, a few diners sit at tables, soaking up what feels like the last breath of the year\u2019s warm sunshine, tucked in against the high, foliage-clad walls of the old barn. A herd of sheep and what appear to be a couple of llamas \u2013 I\u2019ve never been that great on my camelids \u2013 keep the grass short beyond the fence. The air smells sweetly of leaf mulch on the turn. Inside, a certain kind of England is being fed, and being fed exceptionally well; it is that part of England, to be fair, which would think it has little interest in this newspaper. And yet, here I am, on the site of one of the country\u2019s oldest vineyards, about to have a very lovely time. The late Beryl Cook would have recognised some of the ladies here from her own paintings, their glasses perched just on the bridge of the nose, as they give themselves to a good lunch. The men too, for that matter. It is a place for people-watching. This older crowd, a lot of them now untroubled by the call of daily work, has nowhere better to be than here, inside this vaulting space, the walls traced by gnarled beams only just about managing a straight line. The art is tasteful. The paintwork, in muted tones, is tasteful. There is a cleaned, blue-black mussel shell staring at us from the bowl of snowy sea salt, the better to scoop it up. It\u2019s that kind of tasteful. Come friends, and slip gently with me into the restaurant equivalent of the bubble bath you never quite want to leave. I am late to this party, by about a quarter of a century. The Leaping Hare has been in the Good Food Guide for 25 years, and has held a Bib Gourmand, the most interesting award from the tyre company, representing good food at a reasonable price, for more than 20 years. There are hints on the menu of an awareness of the times and their passing. The word \u201cforaged\u201d appears. There are asterisks to indicate that certain dishes are made with ingredients from the estate or from within five miles of it; on others, that the key ingredients are from Norfolk or Suffolk. The whole \u201cdiving into hedgerows to find wild things that taste much like farmed things\u201d has never quite excited me; as I\u2019ve said before and I\u2019ll keep saying, if foraging were so great, presumably we would want everyone to be doing it. If that happened, the eco-system would collapse. Farming was a great invention. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s all irrelevant if what happens to those ingredients when they reach the kitchen misses the mark. Here, it doesn\u2019t. The cooking at the Leaping Hare isn\u2019t innovative. It\u2019s British produce, given a proper seeing to with lots of classic French bourgeois technique and an emphasis on big, crowd-pleasing flavours. You may not coo over the first mouthful. Instead, gently, as the meal goes on, you will clock just how well you are being cared for. A partridge breast is seared and roasted, but there is still a crimson blush within. There\u2019s more partridge broken into the rich stew of white beans and lardons upon which it sits. A scoop of golden fried breadcrumbs, flecked with the green of herbs, is spread across the top to give it a texture. It\u2019s a lot of starter for \u00a37.95. That understanding of the need for crunch is obvious in a second starter of spiced and roasted monkfish, with golden onion rings, looking like something you could wear as a dainty bangle, speared by crisp batons of green apple. It comes on what is described simply as \u201ccurry sauce\u201d. It is the deep yellow of the best butter. It is sweet. It is only very lightly spiced. It\u2019s the perfect sauce for a coronation chicken, and lubricates the fish perfectly. It makes me laugh out loud. It\u2019s like meeting an old friend unexpectedly, after a long time separated. Venison, served rare enough for you to imagine you could test the blood type, comes with roasted shallots, savoy cabbage and their version of clapshot \u2013 mash mixed through with parsnip \u2013 and a rich game jus that\u2019s so shiny you could see your face in it. There are onion rings, again, for that bit of texture. They are tiny this time, as if designed for your pinkie rather than your wrist. It\u2019s also a menu that recognises the value of letting a dish give up its own secrets. Duck breast has been rendered so that there is only a thin layer of fat beneath the bronzed skin. Here are damsons from the estate, and whorls of a smooth, duck liver parfait and a few crushed hazelnuts. Here, too, is the advertised dauphinoise, served as a crisped rectangle. We are pleased to see it. But hang on, what\u2019s this in the middle? The two slabs of potato are sandwiching long-cooked then shredded duck, as if it were some savoury bourbon biscuit. It feels like you\u2019ve been lobbed a freebie. Yours for \u00a319.95. Their dark chocolate sorbet is good; the lip-puckering passion fruit flavour is better. Best of all is a pavlova, the meringue part fashioned through some sort of kitchen witchcraft into a cup, filled with damsons and damson ice-cream and sugared nuts for crunch. It disappears quickly. Service is of the smooth, unobtrusive kind that recognises that people eating here probably want to talk to each other, more than they wish to hear long speeches. There is a bustling caf\u00e9 down at the other end of the room, knocking out fishcakes, pasta dishes and bowls of mussels. They don\u2019t miss a beat, in either space. This, of course, is a vineyard. It is only right that we drink some of what might be called their ros\u00e9, were it not the deep pink of pear drops. It is luscious, a last taste of the summer just gone. We pay up and wander into the \u201ccountry store\u201d out the back, selling picture frames and children\u2019s books, salad servers and vases and all manner of things you didn\u2019t think you needed until you saw them. Outside the breeze blows, the leaves fall and all is very much right with the world. News bites My strongest memory of Maison Bleue in Bury St Edmunds, from my visit a few years back, is of a lady in a hat, eating oysters off the half shell by herself. It was all very civilised. If anything, the offering has stepped up a notch since then. Go for the likes of crab with apple, caviar and lemon grass, or rabbit with kohlrabi and oyster ice cream, followed by halibut with a cauliflower crust and a cockle emulsion (maisonbleue.co.uk). Despite the collapse of the Jamie\u2019s Italian chain earlier this year, Jamie Oliver is pushing ahead with his mid-market restaurant interests, only outside the UK. He is to launch Jamie Oliver\u2019s Kitchen, an all-day concept, in Bali and Bangkok. According to the company the menu could be \u2018easily adapted to local flavours and food trends\u2019. In Bangkok, for example, this will include a soft shell crab burger with green papaya salad. A simple marker of the economic challenges faced by the UK\u2019s hospitality industry: according to research by accountants UHY Hacker Young, the country\u2019s top 100 restaurants recorded a combined loss of \u00a393 million in the past year. In the previous 12 months it was a \u00a337m profit. Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1",

They will tell themselves that 88% of Republican voters still support Trump, and that their duty is to them.</p> <p>It does not matter that these voters inhabit a parallel political universe consisting of Trump tweets, Fox News, rightwing radio, and Trump-Russian social media, all propounding the absurd counter-narrative that Democrats, the \u201cdeep state\u201d, coastal elites, and mainstream media are conspiring to remove the Chosen One from office.</p> <p>So if there\u2019s no chance of getting the 20 Republican votes needed to send Trump packing, is there any reason for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/29/trump-impeachment-hearings-nadler-letter\">this impeachment proceeding</a> to continue?</p> <p>Yes. There are three reasons.</p> <p>The first is the constitution itself. Donald Trump has openly abused his power \u2013 not only seeking electoral help from foreign nations but making money off his presidency in violation of the emoluments clause, spending funds never appropriated by Congress in violation of the separation of powers, obstructing justice, and violating his oath to faithfully execute the law.</p> <p>A failure by Congress to respond to these abuses would effectively render the constitution meaningless. Congress has no alternative but to respond.</p> <p>The second reason is political. While the impeachment hearings don\u2019t appear to have moved Republican voters, only 29% of Americans still identify as Republican.</p> <p>The hearings do seem to have affected Democrats and independents, as well as many people who sat out the 2016 election. National polls by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000016e-a477-dc5f-a9ef-a6ff38ea0000\">Morning Consult/Politico</a> and <a href=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/11/25/rel13a.-.trump,.impeachment.pdf\">SSRS/CNN</a> show that 50% of respondents now support both impeaching Trump and removing him from office, an increase from Morning Consult/Politico\u2019s <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/191151_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_JB.pdf\">mid-November poll</a>.</p> <p>Presumably anyone who now favors removing Trump from office will be inclined to vote against him next November. The House\u2019s impeachment could therefore swing the 2020 election against him.</p> <p>The third reason for the House to impeach Trump even if the Senate won\u2019t convict him concerns the pardoning power of the president.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/30/trump-ukraine-alleged-bribery-impeachment-inquiry\">The inside story of Trump's alleged bribery of Ukraine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Assume that Trump is impeached on grounds that include a raft of federal crimes \u2013 bribery, treason, obstruction of justice, election fraud, money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the United States, making false statements to the federal government, serving as an agent of a foreign government without registering with the justice department, donating funds from foreign nationals, and so on.</p> <p>Regardless of whether a sitting president can be indicted and convicted on such criminal charges, Trump will become liable to them at some point. But could he be pardoned, as Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon 45 years ago?</p> <p>Article II, section 2 of the constitution gives a president the power to pardon anyone who has been convicted of offenses against the United States, with one exception: \u201cin Cases of Impeachment.\u201d</p> <p>If Trump is impeached by the House, he can never be pardoned for these crimes. He cannot pardon himself (it\u2019s dubious that a president has this self-pardoning power in any event), and he cannot be pardoned by a future president.</p> <p>Even if a subsequent president wanted to pardon Trump in the interest of, say, domestic tranquility, she could not.</p> <p>Gerald Ford wrote in his pardon of Nixon that if Nixon were indicted and subject to a criminal trial, \u201cthe tranquility to which this nation has been restored by the events of recent weeks could be irreparably lost\u201d.</p> <p>Had the House impeached Nixon, Ford\u2019s hands would have been tied.</p> <p>Trump is not going to be so lucky.

It does not matter that these voters inhabit a parallel political universe consisting of Trump tweets, Fox News, rightwing radio, and Trump-Russian social media, all propounding the absurd counter-narrative that Democrats, the \u201cdeep state\u201d, coastal elites, and mainstream media are conspiring to remove the Chosen One from office. So if there\u2019s no chance of getting the 20 Republican votes needed to send Trump packing, is there any reason for this impeachment proceeding to continue? Yes. There are three reasons. The first is the constitution itself. Donald Trump has openly abused his power \u2013 not only seeking electoral help from foreign nations but making money off his presidency in violation of the emoluments clause, spending funds never appropriated by Congress in violation of the separation of powers, obstructing justice, and violating his oath to faithfully execute the law. A failure by Congress to respond to these abuses would effectively render the constitution meaningless. Congress has no alternative but to respond. The second reason is political. While the impeachment hearings don\u2019t appear to have moved Republican voters, only 29% of Americans still identify as Republican. The hearings do seem to have affected Democrats and independents, as well as many people who sat out the 2016 election. National polls by Morning Consult/Politico and SSRS/CNN show that 50% of respondents now support both impeaching Trump and removing him from office, an increase from Morning Consult/Politico\u2019s mid-November poll. Presumably anyone who now favors removing Trump from office will be inclined to vote against him next November. The House\u2019s impeachment could therefore swing the 2020 election against him. The third reason for the House to impeach Trump even if the Senate won\u2019t convict him concerns the pardoning power of the president. Assume that Trump is impeached on grounds that include a raft of federal crimes \u2013 bribery, treason, obstruction of justice, election fraud, money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the United States, making false statements to the federal government, serving as an agent of a foreign government without registering with the justice department, donating funds from foreign nationals, and so on. Regardless of whether a sitting president can be indicted and convicted on such criminal charges, Trump will become liable to them at some point. But could he be pardoned, as Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon 45 years ago? Article II, section 2 of the constitution gives a president the power to pardon anyone who has been convicted of offenses against the United States, with one exception: \u201cin Cases of Impeachment.\u201d If Trump is impeached by the House, he can never be pardoned for these crimes. He cannot pardon himself (it\u2019s dubious that a president has this self-pardoning power in any event), and he cannot be pardoned by a future president. Even if a subsequent president wanted to pardon Trump in the interest of, say, domestic tranquility, she could not. Gerald Ford wrote in his pardon of Nixon that if Nixon were indicted and subject to a criminal trial, \u201cthe tranquility to which this nation has been restored by the events of recent weeks could be irreparably lost\u201d. Had the House impeached Nixon, Ford\u2019s hands would have been tied. Trump is not going to be so lucky. The House will probably impeach him before Christmas and then his chance of getting a pardon for his many crimes will be gone.",

Marcus reports that at a gathering of Washington\u2019s high and mighty, the Alfalfa Club dinner, shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Gregory Kennedy, the justice\u2019s son, approached the White House aide Kellyanne Conway and conveyed that \u201cno one \u2026 was happier about the election\u201d than his father.</p> <p>In fairness, the author also records the younger Kennedy\u2019s email denial that he ever spoke to Conway about his father\u2019s \u201cviews about the election or any other subject\u201d. Notably, he does not deny meeting Conway. Justice is not always blind.</p> <p>The appointments of Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were not isolated events. Rather, they marked a culmination of a concerted effort by movement conservatives to remake the courts in their image. While abortion was very much part of their agenda, so was stymying the administrative state and rolling back the New Deal.</p> <p>A graduate of Yale and Harvard Law School, Marcus recalls that last spring, the court\u2019s conservative flank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/30/confirmation-bias-review-carl-hulse-republicans-supreme-court\">signaled interest</a> in undoing the legislative legacy of the Great Depression <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/opinion/sunday/gundy-united-states.html\">as unconstitutionally broad delegations of congressional authority</a>. <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/gundy-v-united-states-3\">In the words of </a><a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/gundy-v-united-states-3\">Justice Samuel Alito</a>: \u201cIf a majority of this court were willing to reconsider the approach we have taken for the past 84 years, I would support that effort.\u201d At the time, the Chief Justice John Roberts and Clarence Thomas conveyed similar sentiments.</p> <p>This past Monday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1198973108532711424\">Kavanaugh flashed that he was there too</a>, making that five justices in all, a majority. Expressly invoking a Gorsuch dissent, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/112519zor_8mj9.pdf\">Kavanaugh observed</a> that the \u201cconstitution\u2019s nondelegation doctrine \u2026 may warrant further consideration in future cases\u201d. Paraphrasing the late chief justice William Rehnquist, he announced: \u201cMajor national policy decisions must be made by Congress and the president in the legislative process, not delegated by Congress to the executive branch.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, fetuses weren\u2019t the only reasons that large checks were being cut to the Federalist Society, or that constitutional originalism had become the civic religion of the right. FDR\u2019s legacy had to be gutted. Social security may no longer be so secure.</p> <p>As Supreme Ambition makes clear, Trump delivered on his campaign promises, in large measure, because of the efforts of Don McGahn, his now estranged former counsel, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and a one-time McGahn patron. In the face of Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony against Kavanaugh, whom she accused of sexual assault, it was the two men, along with former president George W Bush, who effectively held the line.</p> <p>The nominee angrily denied the allegation but a worried Trump watched the reviews of Ford\u2019s performance and phoned McGahn. He refused to pick up. McGahn explained his insubordination to his deputy, Annie Donaldson: \u201cI don\u2019t talk to quitters.\u201d As framed by Marcus, \u201cthe most important man in the world could not get through to his own lawyer\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5f30a238f8885537a6327891c14d6f8461a772d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f30a238f8885537a6327891c14d6f8461a772d9/0_134_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Blasey Ford is sworn in before testifying to the Senate judiciary committee.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Blasey Ford is sworn in before testifying to the Senate judiciary committee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Bourg/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although McGahn and McConnell remained steadfast, other players did not. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner \u201cboth told the president, \u2018Get rid of Kavanaugh and start over\u2019\u201d, according to one White House adviser quoted by Marcus.

Then as Ford\u2019s allegations became public, like Javanka, Leo raised the possibility of pulling the nomination.</p> <p>As for Trump\u2019s view of Leo, it was hardly kind: \u201cWho\u2019s this little fucking midget?\u201d Marcus\u2019s reporting is consistent with Michael Wolff\u2019s depiction <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/02/siege-review-michael-wolff-trump-fire-and-fury\">in Siege</a> of Trump coming to suspect he was being played by Leo and McGahn.</p> <p>Marcus reserves her own thoughts about Kavanaugh for the end. She acknowledges the evidence against him is far from a slam dunk and does not accuse him of lying. Instead, she posits that what was \u201cso searing to Ford was a passing frolic to Kavanaugh\u201d. Having been heavily intoxicated, according to Ford, Kavanaugh simply didn\u2019t remember the incident.</p> <p>As for Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, Marcus contends that it \u201cdiscredited the White House and Senate\u201d and that Kavanaugh\u2019s \u201ctenure will forever have an asterisk attached \u2013 a blot on Kavanaugh and the court that is, to use Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s phrase, indelible\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps.

Marcus reports that at a gathering of Washington\u2019s high and mighty, the Alfalfa Club dinner, shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Gregory Kennedy, the justice\u2019s son, approached the White House aide Kellyanne Conway and conveyed that \u201cno one \u2026 was happier about the election\u201d than his father. In fairness, the author also records the younger Kennedy\u2019s email denial that he ever spoke to Conway about his father\u2019s \u201cviews about the election or any other subject\u201d. Notably, he does not deny meeting Conway. Justice is not always blind. The appointments of Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were not isolated events. Rather, they marked a culmination of a concerted effort by movement conservatives to remake the courts in their image. While abortion was very much part of their agenda, so was stymying the administrative state and rolling back the New Deal. A graduate of Yale and Harvard Law School, Marcus recalls that last spring, the court\u2019s conservative flank signaled interest in undoing the legislative legacy of the Great Depression as unconstitutionally broad delegations of congressional authority. In the words of Justice Samuel Alito: \u201cIf a majority of this court were willing to reconsider the approach we have taken for the past 84 years, I would support that effort.\u201d At the time, the Chief Justice John Roberts and Clarence Thomas conveyed similar sentiments. This past Monday, Kavanaugh flashed that he was there too, making that five justices in all, a majority. Expressly invoking a Gorsuch dissent, Kavanaugh observed that the \u201cconstitution\u2019s nondelegation doctrine \u2026 may warrant further consideration in future cases\u201d. Paraphrasing the late chief justice William Rehnquist, he announced: \u201cMajor national policy decisions must be made by Congress and the president in the legislative process, not delegated by Congress to the executive branch.\u201d In other words, fetuses weren\u2019t the only reasons that large checks were being cut to the Federalist Society, or that constitutional originalism had become the civic religion of the right. FDR\u2019s legacy had to be gutted. Social security may no longer be so secure. As Supreme Ambition makes clear, Trump delivered on his campaign promises, in large measure, because of the efforts of Don McGahn, his now estranged former counsel, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and a one-time McGahn patron. In the face of Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony against Kavanaugh, whom she accused of sexual assault, it was the two men, along with former president George W Bush, who effectively held the line. The nominee angrily denied the allegation but a worried Trump watched the reviews of Ford\u2019s performance and phoned McGahn. He refused to pick up. McGahn explained his insubordination to his deputy, Annie Donaldson: \u201cI don\u2019t talk to quitters.\u201d As framed by Marcus, \u201cthe most important man in the world could not get through to his own lawyer\u201d. Although McGahn and McConnell remained steadfast, other players did not. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner \u201cboth told the president, \u2018Get rid of Kavanaugh and start over\u2019\u201d, according to one White House adviser quoted by Marcus. Even Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society suffered from periodic bouts of pearl clutching. Never a \u201cbig Brett fan\u201d, the man who did much to shape Trump\u2019s court picks became \u201cnervous\u201d about Kavanaugh in the days preceding his nomination. Then as Ford\u2019s allegations became public, like Javanka, Leo raised the possibility of pulling the nomination. As for Trump\u2019s view of Leo, it was hardly kind: \u201cWho\u2019s this little fucking midget?\u201d Marcus\u2019s reporting is consistent with Michael Wolff\u2019s depiction in Siege of Trump coming to suspect he was being played by Leo and McGahn. Marcus reserves her own thoughts about Kavanaugh for the end. She acknowledges the evidence against him is far from a slam dunk and does not accuse him of lying. Instead, she posits that what was \u201cso searing to Ford was a passing frolic to Kavanaugh\u201d. Having been heavily intoxicated, according to Ford, Kavanaugh simply didn\u2019t remember the incident. As for Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, Marcus contends that it \u201cdiscredited the White House and Senate\u201d and that Kavanaugh\u2019s \u201ctenure will forever have an asterisk attached \u2013 a blot on Kavanaugh and the court that is, to use Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s phrase, indelible\u201d. Perhaps. Less than a year from now, the American electorate will give its verdict on this and so much else.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Maynards 10 Year Old Tawny Port, Douro, Portugal NV (\u00a310.99, <a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/\">Aldi</a>)</strong> In the popular imagination, port is a vividly coloured tipple \u2013 a ruby-purple liquid that gets passed around high tables by florid-faced men in Victorian illustrations. The tonal caricature isn\u2019t far off: it\u2019s certainly true of most styles of Port today, from the cheaper ruby, reserve and late bottled vintage, to classic vintage port. But there\u2019s another increasingly popular style, with an altogether more restrained appearance \u2013 one that shows its age rather more visibly than even the oldest of vintage ports. Tawny port is more immediately mellow in flavour and texture too. That\u2019s because it\u2019s been aged, in the case of the super value Maynards, for an average of ten years in wooden casks (vintage port is allowed a maximum two and a half years in barrel or steel tank before it is bottled), giving it its cosseting softness and dusky, fruitcakey flavours.</p> <p><strong>Graham\u2019s 10 Year Old Tawny Port, Douro, Portugal NV (\u00a320.49, <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/\">Waitrose</a>) </strong>The most common age statement used by Port shippers for quality wood-aged ports is 10 Year Old. That\u2019s an average of all the wines in the blend: the recipe for a wine such as Graham\u2019s textbook example, with its genteel figginess and easygoing nutty richness, contains wines that are both much younger and much older than a decade. It\u2019s up to the blender to maintain a consistent style from batch to batch. The emphasis on those blending skills \u2013 of knowing your ingredients, and being right on top of your inventory of barrels of various ages \u2013 takes the art of tawny port-making rather closer in spirit to whisky or brandy production. And a bottle of an older tawny \u2013 such as the immeasurably complex, rich and resonant Taylor\u2019s 30 Year Old Tawny Port (\u00a369, <a href=\"https://www.waitrosecellar.com/\">Waitrose</a>) \u2013 will match the finest of single malts or Cognacs as a late-night, fireside sipper.</p> <p><strong>Kopke Colheita Vintage Port, Douro, Portugal 1999 (from \u00a332.99, <a href=\"https://www.waitrosecellar.com/\">Waitrose Cellar</a>; <a href=\"http://hedonism.co.uk\">Hedonism</a>)</strong> Not all great wood-aged ports are average age-dated blends. Occasionally you\u2019ll see the Portuguese word for harvest, colheita, and a year on the label. That means the wine has been taken from a single vintage, like vintage port. But, unlike vintage port, it\u2019s been aged in previously used oak casks for at least seven years before being bottled. By the time it\u2019s out for sale in the world, then, its characteristics are much closer to a tawny port than a vintage, and it\u2019s ready for drinking immediately. The best represent some of the finest ports around. As a Christmas treat, Kopke\u2019s 20-year-old beauty is silky and ethereally aromatic. Or look for Quinta do Noval, whose latest Colheita from 2005 (\u00a350) is beautifully poised between richness and deftness and just coming into the same stockists as the more powerful but equally lovely 2003 (<a href=\"https://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/\">Selfridges</a>, <a href=\"https://www.corneyandbarrow.com/\">Corney &amp; Barrow</a>).</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

The tonal caricature isn\u2019t far off: it\u2019s certainly true of most styles of Port today, from the cheaper ruby, reserve and late bottled vintage, to classic vintage port. But there\u2019s another increasingly popular style, with an altogether more restrained appearance \u2013 one that shows its age rather more visibly than even the oldest of vintage ports. Tawny port is more immediately mellow in flavour and texture too. That\u2019s because it\u2019s been aged, in the case of the super value Maynards, for an average of ten years in wooden casks (vintage port is allowed a maximum two and a half years in barrel or steel tank before it is bottled), giving it its cosseting softness and dusky, fruitcakey flavours. Graham\u2019s 10 Year Old Tawny Port, Douro, Portugal NV (\u00a320.49, Waitrose) The most common age statement used by Port shippers for quality wood-aged ports is 10 Year Old. That\u2019s an average of all the wines in the blend: the recipe for a wine such as Graham\u2019s textbook example, with its genteel figginess and easygoing nutty richness, contains wines that are both much younger and much older than a decade. It\u2019s up to the blender to maintain a consistent style from batch to batch. The emphasis on those blending skills \u2013 of knowing your ingredients, and being right on top of your inventory of barrels of various ages \u2013 takes the art of tawny port-making rather closer in spirit to whisky or brandy production. And a bottle of an older tawny \u2013 such as the immeasurably complex, rich and resonant Taylor\u2019s 30 Year Old Tawny Port (\u00a369, Waitrose) \u2013 will match the finest of single malts or Cognacs as a late-night, fireside sipper. Kopke Colheita Vintage Port, Douro, Portugal 1999 (from \u00a332.99, Waitrose Cellar; Hedonism) Not all great wood-aged ports are average age-dated blends. Occasionally you\u2019ll see the Portuguese word for harvest, colheita, and a year on the label. That means the wine has been taken from a single vintage, like vintage port. But, unlike vintage port, it\u2019s been aged in previously used oak casks for at least seven years before being bottled. By the time it\u2019s out for sale in the world, then, its characteristics are much closer to a tawny port than a vintage, and it\u2019s ready for drinking immediately. The best represent some of the finest ports around. As a Christmas treat, Kopke\u2019s 20-year-old beauty is silky and ethereally aromatic. Or look for Quinta do Noval, whose latest Colheita from 2005 (\u00a350) is beautifully poised between richness and deftness and just coming into the same stockists as the more powerful but equally lovely 2003 (Selfridges, Corney &amp; Barrow).

The Kitzinger message was simple yet subtle: mothers who are well attended by sympathetic midwives in calm surroundings (and in a setting equipped for every medical eventuality) are more likely to relax in labour and be able to listen to their bodies.

There are not enough midwives, so the calm, patient, individual support they are trained to give is not available to all women. Postnatal wards are also so understaffed that women are often deprived of basic care for them and their babies, and lack the privacy and dignity they need to recover properly from the rigours of birth.

Scores of fellows at the Society of Antiquaries of London, a charity that promotes the study of the past, are up in arms about the vote, which has allowed Hubert Chesshyre to continue as a fellow. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) heard evidence that Chesshyre, an expert on heraldry and genealogy who held a number of senior positions within the royal household, was found to have sexually abused a teenage chorister over the course of three years in the 1990s. The 2015 finding was made following a \u201ctrial of the facts\u201d, which is held when someone is considered unable to plead due to their poor mental and physical health. As a result, despite being found to have committed the abuse, Chesshyre \u2013 who is said to have dementia \u2013 was given an absolute discharge. The finding saw fellows at the society, one of Britain\u2019s oldest educational institutions, granted a royal charter in 1751, table a resolution demanding his removal. But a majority of fellows who voted backed Chesshyre, a former president of its elite dining club, the Cocked Hat Club. In an open letter published on Sunday in the Observer, many fellows expressed outrage at the decision. Pledging their support to the victim, they signalled their \u201cdetermination to reform the organisation so that it reflects the values and behaviours that should be expected from any public organisation or individual\u201d. They add: \u201cThe voting arrangements were such that only around 100 of the society\u2019s 3,000 fellows were able to attend the vote, which due to the existing governance structures of the society only allowed voting in person on a weekday afternoon. This disenfranchised a large number of fellows unable to attend at such a time. \u201cThe 76 fellows who voted against the proposal to remove Mr Chesshyre\u2019s fellowship do not represent us, and do not represent the values and behaviours of any organisation we are willing to be members of.\u201d Paul Drury, the society\u2019s president, denied that the vote showed it had \u201cstood by\u201d Chesshyre. \u201cWe are committed to acting in ways which are consistent with our status as an educational charity operating for the public benefit, and as an institution which confers public recognition of the achievements of its fellows,\u201d he said in a statement on its website. \u201cWe are therefore actively working on the reform of our statutes, to enable swift action to remove fellowship from those who do not live up to the society\u2019s expectations of integrity and good character.\u201d Drury added: \u201cThe society unreservedly apologises to the victim for any hurt the defeat may have caused.\u201d",

She\u2019s run loads of marathons \u2013 more than 10, a sort of madness \u2013 for various charities, including the <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/get-involved/become-a-partner/our-charity-partners/bobby-moore-fund\" title=\"\">Bobby Moore Fund</a> for Cancer Research UK and <a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Wom</a><a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/\" title=\"\">en\u2019s Aid</a>. She has ridden three stages of the Tour de France, raising money for disadvantaged young people, and, in 2016, did a six-week, 3,000-mile cycle ride from the London Olympic Stadium to Rio de Janeiro to raise funds for the Jane Tomlinson Appeal. While in Rio, she came down with a rare strain of malaria and was given 24 hours to live. She lived. Almost immediately, she joined up with charities that work to eradicate malaria, launching a <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/uganda/stories/17-districts-roll-out-mass-action-against-malaria-initiative-wipe-out-disease\" title=\"\">Mass Action Against Malaria</a> initiative in Uganda in 2018 and giving a keynote parliamentary speech.</p> <p>And now she\u2019s made a podcast, <strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/undiscussable/id1486526400\" title=\"\">Undiscussable</a></strong>. It is not at all what you might expect from her CV, though her charity work gives a hint. Webster\u2019s life has not always been easy, especially when she was younger, and much of her adult life has been spent rushing around trying to find solutions to what has hurt her, so that others don\u2019t suffer. She is that most marvellous thing, a proper, driven do-gooder.</p> <p>So, <em>Undiscussable</em>. This is a podcast about domestic abuse and what we might do in the UK to help solve it. With my critic\u2019s hat on, I can tell you that, structurally and editorially, <em>Undiscussable</em> is a bit of a mess. Webster hops about, both physically \u2013 one minute she\u2019s at a women\u2019s refuge, the next she\u2019s at a meeting at 10 Downing Street \u2013 and mentally. She\u2019ll make a point about how much money domestic abuse costs the world; then wonder why we concentrate on women being abused, and not men; and follow that with a quick mention of the domestic abuse bill (currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/06/prorogation-of-uk-parliament-must-not-delay-domestic-abuse-reform-say-activists\" title=\"\">making very slow progress</a> through its various stages). All this without really explaining what she\u2019s up to, or why. In terms of storytelling \u2013 a clear, narrative through-line \u2013 this podcast is all over the shop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"485f1751d3de9c9b7af6f8aa2df3a61aa546e8ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/485f1751d3de9c9b7af6f8aa2df3a61aa546e8ff/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undiscussable\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But, crikey, Webster utterly makes up for this with her energy and, even more, her empathy. She listens, she understands, she gives people the time to tell their stories. She talks to experts, to survivors, to people working on the frontline; she gets upset, she gets cross, she cries. I cried, too, on several occasions. And in episode five, <a href=\"https://charliewebster.com/undiscussable/2019/11/16/episode-five-fighting-your-past\" title=\"\">Fighting Your Past</a>, Webster explains why she is so moved to try and solve domestic abuse. She reads out an essay she wrote when she was a teenager, entitled Notes on Life: \u201cI remember the time when I looked into those psychotic eyes as he charged down the corridor, clearly coming for me. His teeth were gritted so hard\u2026 His intimidating size made me shrink down into a corner, my whole body began to shake violently and my stomach hurt so much.\u201d Surely, you think, a teacher would read this and immediately contact social services. But nobody did a thing. Still, she got an A* for the essay.</p> <p>Webster talks to her mum about their shared past with Webster\u2019s stepdad. Her mum says, \u201cI was trying to create the love that I wanted, and the family that I wanted, by creating this look on the outside, saying, this is what I want. I used to think it would change.\u201d Webster\u2019s stepfather and her mother were together for 29 years. She left with two Lidl bags of belongings and \u00a360.</p> <p>In the midst of all of this, Webster is big enough to make the point that perpetrators of domestic and sexual abuse are usually victims themselves. Their abusive actions were learned when young from those older than them. Webster has particular empathy for teenage boys, who are often blamed as evil, when they simply haven\u2019t been taught how to have healthy relationships.</p> <p>And in <a href=\"https://charliewebster.com/undiscussable/2019/11/16/episode-four-raising-perpetrators\" title=\"\">episode four</a>, she meets Zac. Zac works with boys that display harmful behaviours, helping them unlearn dangerous sexist assumptions. \u201cWhen that young person was 11,\u201d he says, \u201cwe were fine with them saying: \u2018Oh, girls have to do this, if you ask a girl for sex you should get sex.\u2019 We thought that was just lad banter. But then when they commit a rape five years later\u2026\u201d Zac gets a lot of school referrals. He has funding to work in just two London boroughs, Brent and Croydon.</p> <p>God, <em>Undiscussable</em> is compelling, essential listening. Yes, it has its flaws. Yes, like its creator, it tries to do too much. But, you know what? At least it\u2019s trying.</p> <h2>Three interesting business podcasts</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.loudandquiet.com/podcasts-category/music-made-me-do-it/\" title=\"\">Music Made Me Do It</a></strong><br>A new podcast from <em>Loud and Quiet</em> magazine, this interviews people who\u2019ve started businesses in the music industry. Stuart Stubbs presents, and the first show is with Paul Epworth (producer of Adele, Paul McCartney and loads of others). Epworth talks (a lot) about his career, chosen because, as a musician, he \u201cwasn\u2019t particularly good\u201d, so thought he would learn how to make his music sound better: \u201cI honed my talent as somebody who was able to polish a turd\u201d. Future episodes promise Martin Mills, founder of Beggars Banquet, and PR extraordinaire Barbara Charone.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.fremantle.com/new-podcast-series-shines-a-light-on-working-in-creative-industries/\" title=\"\">How Do You Do?</a></strong><br>Another new podcast explaining the baffling world of the creative industries. Presented by Hattie Moir and Florence Bass, this show is brought together by Random House, DK Books, BMG and Freemantle, and so features book, music and TV types. Some sharper editing and better music is needed, but the first show, with Tim Fairclough, telly researcher, is interesting, especially if you\u2019ve never understood quite what that title means. Good people coming up include James Cooper from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/16/my-dad-wrote-a-porno-and-i-turned-it-into-a-podcast\" title=\"\">My Dad Wrote a Porno</a></em>, as well as Emma Wallace, who works as senior audience and brand manager for Stormzy\u2019s Merky Books.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/secret-leaders/id1229438369\" title=\"\">Secret Leaders</a></strong><br>This British podcast recently knocked the biggest (business) podcast out there \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-tim-ferriss-show/id863897795?mt=2\" title=\"\">The Tim Ferriss Show</a></em> \u2013 off Apple\u2019s top podcast slot. Presented by the amiable Dan Murray and Rich Martell, each show kicks off with some slightly redundant either/or questions, but don\u2019t let that put you off. Now in its fourth season, it\u2019s had some great guests, including Martha Lane Fox, Jo Malone and many more. The interviews are relaxed and insightful, the show is well edited and the guests open up. Recommended.</p>",

His teeth were gritted so hard\u2026 His intimidating size made me shrink down into a corner, my whole body began to shake violently and my stomach hurt so much.\u201d Surely, you think, a teacher would read this and immediately contact social services. But nobody did a thing. Still, she got an A* for the essay. Webster talks to her mum about their shared past with Webster\u2019s stepdad. Her mum says, \u201cI was trying to create the love that I wanted, and the family that I wanted, by creating this look on the outside, saying, this is what I want. I used to think it would change.\u201d Webster\u2019s stepfather and her mother were together for 29 years. She left with two Lidl bags of belongings and \u00a360. In the midst of all of this, Webster is big enough to make the point that perpetrators of domestic and sexual abuse are usually victims themselves. Their abusive actions were learned when young from those older than them. Webster has particular empathy for teenage boys, who are often blamed as evil, when they simply haven\u2019t been taught how to have healthy relationships. And in episode four, she meets Zac. Zac works with boys that display harmful behaviours, helping them unlearn dangerous sexist assumptions. \u201cWhen that young person was 11,\u201d he says, \u201cwe were fine with them saying: \u2018Oh, girls have to do this, if you ask a girl for sex you should get sex.\u2019 We thought that was just lad banter. But then when they commit a rape five years later\u2026\u201d Zac gets a lot of school referrals. He has funding to work in just two London boroughs, Brent and Croydon. God, Undiscussable is compelling, essential listening. Yes, it has its flaws. Yes, like its creator, it tries to do too much. But, you know what? At least it\u2019s trying. Three interesting business podcasts Music Made Me Do It A new podcast from Loud and Quiet magazine, this interviews people who\u2019ve started businesses in the music industry. Stuart Stubbs presents, and the first show is with Paul Epworth (producer of Adele, Paul McCartney and loads of others). Epworth talks (a lot) about his career, chosen because, as a musician, he \u201cwasn\u2019t particularly good\u201d, so thought he would learn how to make his music sound better: \u201cI honed my talent as somebody who was able to polish a turd\u201d. Future episodes promise Martin Mills, founder of Beggars Banquet, and PR extraordinaire Barbara Charone. How Do You Do? Another new podcast explaining the baffling world of the creative industries. Presented by Hattie Moir and Florence Bass, this show is brought together by Random House, DK Books, BMG and Freemantle, and so features book, music and TV types. Some sharper editing and better music is needed, but the first show, with Tim Fairclough, telly researcher, is interesting, especially if you\u2019ve never understood quite what that title means. Good people coming up include James Cooper from My Dad Wrote a Porno, as well as Emma Wallace, who works as senior audience and brand manager for Stormzy\u2019s Merky Books. Secret Leaders This British podcast recently knocked the biggest (business) podcast out there \u2013 The Tim Ferriss Show \u2013 off Apple\u2019s top podcast slot. Presented by the amiable Dan Murray and Rich Martell, each show kicks off with some slightly redundant either/or questions, but don\u2019t let that put you off. Now in its fourth season, it\u2019s had some great guests, including Martha Lane Fox, Jo Malone and many more. The interviews are relaxed and insightful, the show is well edited and the guests open up. Recommended.",

Presented by wildlife biologist Liz Bonnin, who presented last year\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/01/drowning-in-plastic-review-a-rallying-cry-to-ditch-plastic-but-is-it-too-late\" title=\"\">Drowning in Plastic</a></em>, it was a damning exploration of the global meat industry, mainly focused on the US, where the right to consume vast quantities of meat with squirty bottles of barbecue sauce appears to have been written into the American Constitution.</p> <p>The ugly truths were relentless. <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/chart-of-the-day-this-is-how-many-animals-we-eat-each-year/\" title=\"\">The world consumes 65bn animals annually.</a> Cattle rearing has reduced the Amazon forest by 20% (and counting). Wildlife species are perishing\u2026 and so on. Bonnin clearly wished to maintain her scientific distance, but even she became tearful when she observed the hacked-up Amazon from a plane; elsewhere, you could almost smell the steaming lakes of Barbie-pink toxic pig waste. For this soppy vegetarian, the industrial \u201cfeed-farms\u201d and barns of pigs and chickens were unbearable \u2013 a veritable Glastonbury of animal death.</p> <p>One documentary couldn\u2019t cover everything; as always with these reports, more questions were raised than answered. However, Bonnin, who has now given up red meat, more than did her bit in smashing the emergency glass of public consciousness.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbsaUHdxGHg\" title=\"\">Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator</a> </strong>was a documentary about Bikram Choudhury, 75, the self-styled \u201cbad boy of yoga\u201d, infamous for conducting his vast, overheated classes clad in only a pair of Speedos and a Rolex. What could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>Eva Orner\u2019s documentary probed forensically into the still-esteemed yoga guru, but the main focus was on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/20/bikram-choudhury-yoga-founder-abuse-netflix-documentary\" title=\"\">the rape/sexual allegations</a> from former students on his $10K teacher-training courses, featuring interviews with some of the women. Choudhury was also sued by a student for racial discrimination (\u201cGet that black bitch out of here, she\u2019s a cancer\u201d). When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/18/bikram-hot-yoga-scandal-choudhury-what-he-wanted\" title=\"\">Choudhury lost a $6.8m civil case (wrongful termination/sexual harassment</a>) brought by a former legal adviser, he fled the US without paying up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c98cd6cabf1cb6c0a5ff204e9b783f32bb1bcd3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c98cd6cabf1cb6c0a5ff204e9b783f32bb1bcd3c/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bikram Choudhury at work in the \u2018truly shocking\u2019 Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bikram Choudhury at work in the \u2018truly shocking\u2019 Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While he clearly views himself as a lovable showman, a yogi-Barnum, Choudhury comes across as a clueless, narcissistic motormouth \u2013 even in a legal deposition he lists his dislikes as \u201ccold weather, cold food, cold heart, cold pussy\u201d. Watching all this, it was striking to note the bizarre masochism of the affluent west, with Choudhury\u2019s students just accepting his startling rudeness (\u201cSuck that fucking fat stomach in, I don\u2019t like to see the jiggle-jiggle\u201d).</p> <p>The culture of systemic sexist abuse predated #MeToo, with god knows how many young women (usually dependent on Choudhury for permission to open Bikram studios) summoned for late-night \u201cmassages\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Meat: A Threat to our Planet? (BBC One) | iPlayer Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator (Netflix) My Grandparents\u2019 War (Channel 4) | All4 Elton John: Uncensored (BBC One) | iPlayer Silicon Valley (Sky Atlantic) If Meat: A Threat To Our Planet? didn\u2019t put you off your hotdog, nothing will. Presented by wildlife biologist Liz Bonnin, who presented last year\u2019s Drowning in Plastic, it was a damning exploration of the global meat industry, mainly focused on the US, where the right to consume vast quantities of meat with squirty bottles of barbecue sauce appears to have been written into the American Constitution. The ugly truths were relentless. The world consumes 65bn animals annually. Cattle rearing has reduced the Amazon forest by 20% (and counting). Wildlife species are perishing\u2026 and so on. Bonnin clearly wished to maintain her scientific distance, but even she became tearful when she observed the hacked-up Amazon from a plane; elsewhere, you could almost smell the steaming lakes of Barbie-pink toxic pig waste. For this soppy vegetarian, the industrial \u201cfeed-farms\u201d and barns of pigs and chickens were unbearable \u2013 a veritable Glastonbury of animal death. One documentary couldn\u2019t cover everything; as always with these reports, more questions were raised than answered. However, Bonnin, who has now given up red meat, more than did her bit in smashing the emergency glass of public consciousness. Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator was a documentary about Bikram Choudhury, 75, the self-styled \u201cbad boy of yoga\u201d, infamous for conducting his vast, overheated classes clad in only a pair of Speedos and a Rolex. What could possibly go wrong? Eva Orner\u2019s documentary probed forensically into the still-esteemed yoga guru, but the main focus was on the rape/sexual allegations from former students on his $10K teacher-training courses, featuring interviews with some of the women. Choudhury was also sued by a student for racial discrimination (\u201cGet that black bitch out of here, she\u2019s a cancer\u201d). When Choudhury lost a $6.8m civil case (wrongful termination/sexual harassment) brought by a former legal adviser, he fled the US without paying up. While he clearly views himself as a lovable showman, a yogi-Barnum, Choudhury comes across as a clueless, narcissistic motormouth \u2013 even in a legal deposition he lists his dislikes as \u201ccold weather, cold food, cold heart, cold pussy\u201d. Watching all this, it was striking to note the bizarre masochism of the affluent west, with Choudhury\u2019s students just accepting his startling rudeness (\u201cSuck that fucking fat stomach in, I don\u2019t like to see the jiggle-jiggle\u201d). The culture of systemic sexist abuse predated #MeToo, with god knows how many young women (usually dependent on Choudhury for permission to open Bikram studios) summoned for late-night \u201cmassages\u201d. The truly shocking thing is that Choudhury, who denies all allegations and hasn\u2019t been charged, continues teaching outside the US. Scanning the participants for My Grandparents\u2019 War (Helena Bonham Carter, Kristin Scott Thomas, Mark Rylance, Carey Mulligan), I couldn\u2019t help but wonder: don\u2019t working-class people or ethnic minorities have wars? Or grandparents? That said, this opener from Bonham Carter was both fascinating and poignant. In Britain during the second world war, her paternal grandmother, Lady Violet Bonham Carter, helped refugees and spoke out against antisemitism to such an extent that she was placed on a Gestapo blacklist. In France, Bonham Carter\u2019s maternal grandfather, Eduardo Propper de Callej\u00f3n, a half-Jewish Spanish diplomat, authorised as many visas as he could to help Jewish people escape the Nazis, signing with both hands to save time. Eduardo was posthumously honoured by the Jewish community, while Violet spent some of the war as an air warden: \u201cBrave\u2026 but also completely bonkers, going out, bombs flying,\u201d mused Bonham Carter. Nevertheless, she was visibly moved to meet descendants of the people her grandparents helped, one of whom went on to be the founder of Unicef.

But at the end of day three they remain 106 runs behind and victory for either side, and particularly for England, seems unlikely - especially if the rain forecast for Tuesday does indeed fall. If England intend to force a result they will have to score fast and free in the morning, and for their part New Zealand must take early wickets.

They\u2019re starting half an hour early today (9.30pm GMT, 10.30am NZST) in Hamilton, still making up for the grotty weather that truncated day one. New Zealand are whistling to the ground this morning, their bow ties perky, their trainers bouncy - two English wickets down with only 39 on the board.</p> <p>All is not lost for England, but two of the newbies failed to endure a nasty final session of 21 overs yesterday evening. Unfortunate Dom Sibley, never the nimblest, was cuffed on the helmet and then on the box on the way to being bowled by a leg-stump half volley<strong>. </strong> Joe Denly prodded at a wobbler from Matt Henry and was well caught by BJ Watling behind the sticks.</p> <p>The two men who will walk out this morning are Rory Burns, dropped twice yesterday, and Joe Root, suddenly under reams of news-print pressure over the captaincy. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got to go and bat 150 overs here to set up the game on day five,\u201d Stuart Broad said. \u201cOur opportunity is there...Here we\u2019re not batting with a scoreboard of 500. They made 375. So, I think our pressure is reduced slightly and we just go and play.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re a batsman, you\u2019d want to bat out there, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d he added helpfully. \u201cIf you were good at batting, you\u2019d fancy that.\u201d</p> <p>Let\u2019s see hey Stuart.</p> <p>In other news, poor Jack Leach is still in hospital with gastroenteritis, .<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-30T21:09:48.469Z\">at 9.09pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a very decent day for England, with both Burns and Root completing centuries. But at the end of day three they remain 106 runs behind and victory for either side, and particularly for England, seems unlikely - especially if the rain forecast for Tuesday does indeed fall. If England intend to force a result they will have to score fast and free in the morning, and for their part New Zealand must take early wickets. Another session of England meandering along at two runs an over in largely untroubled style and the die will probably be cast. So, the next session could prove decisive; Daniel Harris and Rob Smyth will be here to take you through day four. Bye! Rory Burns has a chat about his dismissal: I thought I was just about there. It was one of those things. I thought I had enough in the tank and then it turned out that I didn\u2019t quite. That\u2019s disappointing, to miss out in that way. It might have been a really good one. The rain is light, but even if they start removing the covers immediately they\u2019re not going to get out in time to do any more actual cricket so play has officially been abandoned for the day. 99.4 overs: Rain stops play They make it two-third of the way through Henry\u2019s over before the players are called off, and the covers are brought on. 99th over: England 267-5 (Root 114, Pope 2) A maiden from Wagner. Meanwhile in London, about 10 minutes ago something went boom and shook my windows. On Twitter people from Essex to Hertfordshire and all corners of London are reporting the same. What does that? I fear this may be the end of the world. Anyway, cricket. The groundstaff are poised with the covers, which isn\u2019t a good sign. 98th over: England 267-5 (Root 114, Pope 2) The players take drinks, and Ian Forth emails about avocados. \u201cThe semiotics of avocados continues to evolve: a symbol of millennial decadence in Australia, and now a metaphor for competitiveness in cricket,\u201d he writes. \u201cMy supermarket shop briefing from my wife is disproportionately focused on avocado purchase strategies: a spectrum from dark to light enabling a rollout of ripeness throughout the week. I don\u2019t remember seeing an avocado growing up in the West Midlands, but now here in Melbourne they\u2019re everywhere. Plus, why are they smashed, when potatoes are mashed? And why avocad-os, but potat-oes? Finally, fruit or vegetable?\u201d I can vaguely remember the era when the British knew them as avocado pears, and they were certainly fruity then. 97th over: England 266-5 (Root 113, Pope 2) England do insist on their risky running. Root this time hits to Williamson and sets off for a single. The Kiwi captain dives, collects and dispatches the ball in one movement, which is brilliantly athletic but makes taking reliable aim nigh on impossible, and he misses the stumps by a couple of feet. 96th over: England 265-5 (Root 112, Pope 2) A single off Southee. 95th over: England 264-5 (Root 111, Pope 2) Wagner welcomes Pope with another delivery that stays horribly low, and maybe this pitch does have a bit of devilry in it! As England made their way to tea in fairly serene style it started to look like a draw was by some margin the most likely outcome of this match, and statistically it still is, but maybe there\u2019s victory here for someone after all. And that scampered single is the only run he\u2019s going to get today! He nibbles a thin edge through to the keeper, and he\u2019s on his way! 94th over: England 261-4 (Root 110, Crawley 1) Crawley gets off the mark with the sharpest of singles to mid-off. Williamson hoovers it up and slings it straight at the stumps, and poor Crawley has to dive to make his ground, which he just about does. In contrast to the Burns run-out, which nobody in the New Zealand team seemed to think actually was out, this time they all run around celebrating, and it isn\u2019t. 93rd over: England 258-4 (Root 108, Crawley 0) Wagner bowls across Root, who helps a ball already heading wide to go a little wider, and gets four for his pains. That takes him to 99; the next ball is bottom-edged into the turf, bounces over the keeper and runs away. England\u2019s captain takes the luck, punches the air, and hunkers down in search of more. A couple of balls later he sends one bouncing past backward point for a third boundary of the over. 92nd over: England 245-4 (Root 95, Crawley 0) Stokes had looked in excellent nick, but suddenly his innings is done, and Zak Crawley is in to face his first ball in Test cricket. He negotiates it safely enough. Stokes edges to first slip, where Ross Taylor takes an excellent low catch! 91st over: England 245-3 (Root 95, Stokes 26) Ooooof! Wagner\u2019s delivery bounces low, goes well under Stokes\u2019s bat and misses leg stump by a couple of inches at most. Root has scored one Test century this year; he has scored two or more every year since 2012, when he played only one match. 90th over: England 244-3 (Root 95, Stokes 25) Southee has a go with the new new ball. and Root takes another stride towards a ton, working the ball to the third man boundary. 89th over: England 239-3 (Root 91, Stokes 24) The new ball is swapped for a different new ball, the old new ball having already lost its shape. \u201cWe\u2019ve got six rock-hard avocados on our kitchen table,\u201d sniffs Mike Atherton. \u201cI reckon they\u2019d be more interesting to bowl with than a Kookaburra ball.\u201d He then launches into a impassioned tirade about the disappointing quality of Kiwi avocados, and their inability ever to ripen. Root, who unlike a New Zealand avocado does seem to be approaching peak condition, moves into the 90s with a splendid cover drive. 88th over: England 235-3 (Root 87, Stokes 24) Henry bowls, and Stokes leans back to blatter the ball wide of mid-off for four. Stokes is looking pretty good, and has scored 60% of his runs through boundaries (pretty much the same as Burns; Root\u2019s hovering at about 40%). 87th over: England 231-3 (Root 87, Stokes 20) Wagner\u2019s back, and he asks a few new questions. His first ball is a decent yorker, which Root jabs his bat down into. Then one straightens nicely, and Root again just about gets his bat in the way. The bowler then calls on the groundsman, who smacks the turf where Wagner\u2019s foot has been landing with a large metal hammer for a while, before Wagner grabs the hammer himself and has a bash. That\u2019ll sort it. Maiden. 86th over: England 231-3 (Root 87, Stokes 20) At 239, this is now Joe Root\u2019s fifth-longest Test innings in terms of balls faced. The four still above it were all played at home, and only one of them in the last five years: at No1, the 406-ball 254 against Pakistan at Old Trafford in 2016. This, then, is his longest innings as captain. 85th over: England 230-3 (Root 86, Stokes 20) Great economy of effort from Stokes, who goes down on onee knee to push the ball wide of cover for four, just immaculate timing, and then slashes at the last, which flashes over backward point and away to the rope again. 84th over: England 222-3 (Root 86, Stokes 12) Henry\u2019s got his head in his hands here, after Root bottom-edges an attempted cut down into his pads, and thence to safely. Could have gone anywhere, that. Another maiden. 83rd over: England 222-3 (Root 86, Stokes 12) A single for Root from the first ball of Southee\u2019s over, and no hint of a scoring stroke from Stokes thereafter. 82nd over: England 221-3 (Root 85, Stokes 12) Since the Burns run-out, when the glaring sunshine caused all sorts of problems for Bruce Oxenford, the TV umpire, a thick blanket of grey cloud has settled in. Some rain is expected, though not until the evening. This is good news for New Zealand, though Matt Henry isn\u2019t able to maximise it here (and also for Oxenford, obviously). The players are back out and ready for more. This is a key session in this match now: New Zealand have taken the new ball, and if a few wickets follow they can power on towards victory. If England see off the new ball, then they can look to put together a morale-boosting total. England had five 400+ scores in 2017, but there has been just one since (and four two-digit totals) and they could really do with putting something properly decent together. 81st over: England 218-3 (Root 84, Stokes 10) Southee takes the fresh cherry, and immediately has it moving about in a slightly concerning manner. Stokes, though, is not overly concerned, and safely makes it through to tea. A good session for England, even though it contained an entirely unnecessary self-inflicted wound in the shape of Burns\u2019 dismissal. 80th over: England 215-3 (Root 84, Stokes 8) The one big surprise about Burns\u2019 dismissal, other than the fact that he was dismissed obviously, and the image that has stuck with me, was the state of his hair when he took his helmet off. That man was seriously perspiring. I\u2019ve never worn a cricket helmet, so I don\u2019t know exactly what it\u2019s like in there, and generally am not one for headgear (though I have worn a full bear suit, which is among my sweatiest experiences), but I\u2019ve seen lots of cricketers take their helmets off and that seemed unusual. One more over before tea, and it\u2019ll be bowled with a new ball. 79th over: England 215-3 (Root 84, Stokes 7) Root hits a lovely cover drive, its only fault being that it goes straight to the fielder at cover. Another Mitchell maiden. 78th over: England 215-3 (Root 84, Stokes 7) Stokes gets his first boundary, pushing Wagner\u2019s delivery with no great power back past the bowler, from where it trundles merrily down the ground. 77th over: England 209-3 (Root 84, Stokes 1) A Mitchell maiden, his third of nine overs bowled . (actually it was 11. My bad) 76th over: England 209-3 (Root 84, Stokes 1) Wagner\u2019s over starts with a Root boundary, and then a single which ends with the bails flying again, more visibly this time, but with the batsman narrowly but clearly home. 75th over: England 204-3 (Root 79, Stokes 1) A change of bails! Within minutes of that overly difficult run-out decision some replacement woodwork is brought out, these a natural shade of wood and thus easily distinguished from nearby white stuff. 74th over: England 203-3 (Root 79, Stokes 1) And there it is! A little nudge off the pads and Burns trots to the other end and completes his second Test century. And then England contrive to give his wicket away! Burns knocks the ball to midwicket and trots off for a gentle single, but at some point and for no obvious reason they decide to run a second, and by the barest of margins they fail to make it. That is some pretty deeply rubbish decision-making right there. That is very close! Though New Zealand don\u2019t exactly celebrate when it happens, it looks like the stumps are broken just before Burns\u2019 bat crosses the line. But what of the bails? The problem is that they\u2019re white, and so are Watling\u2019s gloves, and the rest of his clothes, and the sun\u2019s shining, and it\u2019s just impossible to see on the replays. The TV umpire sounds, well, stumped. But eventually he gets the angle he needs, and he confirms that Burns has gone! 73rd over: England 198-2 (Burns 99, Root 76) Mitchell bowls wide and a little short at Burns, who slashes it away past point for four. A single off the last takes him to 99, and the very verge of a ton. 72nd over: England 192-2 (Burns 94, Root 75) And then Root takes a single off Wagner. Look, I\u2019d have loved to be a bit more fulsome in my description of these first few overs post-takeover, but I\u2019ve been changing the furniture and adding my own email address and stuff, and my computer is behaving as if it too feels it ought to be unconscious at the moment. Anyway, that\u2019s in the past now. Let\u2019s move on. 71st over: England 191-2 (Burns 94, Root 74) Daryl Mitchell returns with a maiden. 70th over: England 191-2 (Burns 94, Root 74) Good evening/morning/whatever everyone. Thanks Tanya. Insight, lol. As they took drinks Root had faced 191 deliveries and Burns 190; the longest innings of the match so far had been BJ Watling\u2019s 192-ball 55. They\u2019ve both overtaken him now, so that\u2019s, well, something. A single for Burns from Wagner\u2019s over, though he has a bit of a slash at one and is lucky to get nothing on it. 69th over: England 190--2 (Burns 93, Root 74) Root sweeps, nicely, for four and then scampers over to the off side to duvet the spin. Then throws the bat, slightly alarmingly?!, at a wide one. And that\u2019s me done, with Simon Burnton waiting in the wings full of insight and more to guide Burns and Root to their centuries. Thanks for all your emails, jokes and tweets, it\u2019s been fun. 68th over: England 186--2 (Burns 93, Root 70) They pause for drinks with Root losing a demi-semi life with an edge through where first slip might have been examining his nails, if only England had lost a few more wickets. 67th over: England 181--2 (Burns 93, Root 66) At last! Some succour for Santner. He gets one to rip out of the rough - it flies down for four leg byes but smelt of promise. And that\u2019s the follow-on ticked off the to-do list. Dan Taylor wants to quote \u201cthe great Carlton Kirby\u2019s tweet from yesterday.\u201d Go for it. So how come you sell Bakewell Fingers and Frangipane Crumble Slices for \u00a31.50 a box of 6, but then charge \u00a35.20 for a slightly lemony sponge? Mr Kipling: \u201cThat\u2019s Madeira Cake!\u201d 66th over: England 176--2 (Burns 93, Root 64) Burns pulls out his pull shot once again - this might be the pick of his days - clunks Henry to the fence and enters the nineties. I\u2019ll eat my slippers if he gets out before three figures. 65th over: England 168--2 (Burns 87, Root 63) Four singles off a Santner not-so-special. Rich writes: Loving the commentary! I too am at the game and was very curious to hear of these elaborate pies. If you could explore the provenance of these kiwi delicacies further, I\u2019d be very grateful. Listen Rich, if you can identify this pair, they might, or might not, be eating an elaborate pie. Or, they have found alternative sustenance. 64th over: England 168--2 (Burns 87, Root 63) Matt Henry continues with the short and wide fishing tactics. It doesn\u2019t work but it nearly brings a run-out as Burns takes a risky single to mid-on. Unfortunately for New Zealand Henry lumbers in front of the stumps and tries a cackhanded interception of the throw, making a complete dog\u2019s breakfast of it. Tom Latham, waiting in perfect position behind the stumps, has his head in his hands. That was a ballsed-up chance. 63rd over: England 164--2 (Burns 85, Root 60) Oh, now, that was just gorge-ous from Joe Root. He strokes the ball through cover with such style and gentleness. Shot of the day! 62nd over: England 156--2 (Burns 85, Root 55) Ok, so Williamson thinks that Henry\u2019s worth a punt. Why not? I think we\u2019v reached the stage o f the game where NZ are waiting for England to make a mistake. Just a dab of a single from the over. 61st over: England 156--2 (Burns 85, Root 55) Just one from Santner\u2019s over, Root gets down on his knee to sweep the ball down for a single.And I got a bit lost there in a post-midnight yawn. 60th over: England 156--2 (Burns 85, Root 55) Another top-class pull shot from Rory Burns. He swivels with panache and bingos the ball past square leg for four. Southee sighs. 59th over: England 152--2 (Burns 81, Root 55) Santner turns again, tries flighting a little more, tries cranking it a little faster. To no avail Just one from the over. This is finger-tapping cricket. Can New Zealand restrict England enough that they get frustrated? Root passes his highest scores in a Test match in New Zealand. Humphrey Hollins, an ex Kiwi, writes from Cairns: Two men in a nudist camp lying on loungers. \u201cHave you read Marx?\u201d said one. His companion replied, \u201cYes, it\u2019s the wicker.\u201d 58th over: England 150--2 (Burns 80, Root 54) Southee bowls wide of the crease, tries to tempt Burns, who resists. Southee, Southee, catchee monkee. 57th over: England 149--2 (Burns 80, Root 53) Three clomped off Santner\u2019s over, who hasn\u2019t threatened that much today. Who is going to be Williamson\u2019s secret weapon? I imagine he\u2019s missing de Grandhomme. 56th over: England 147--2 (Burns 80, Root 51) Southee has a very even approach to the wicket, regular steps, cocked wrists. He tries a wide one without success, he tries a slower ball, Burns ignores it. Hey Tanya, writes Aaron. Hi! I moved out to NZ from the UK a couple my first ever cricket Test here at Seddon Park, having been drawn back in to a sport I loved when I was nine by the summer\u2019s drama in the World Cup and Ashes. Lovely laid back atmosphere here! Your brother\u2019s elaborate pie has us intrigued - where did he find that?! We\u2019ve only been able to find the bao and beer so far! I\u2019ve just re-read my words and I put my probably in the wrong place - it should have read \u201cprobably eating an elaborate pie.\u201d Though he might be. He won\u2019t be reading this (though I\u2019ll text him), but someone else at the ground might be. Can you help Aaron anyone? 55th over: England 144--2 (Burns 78, Root 50) Burns sweeps Santner, the New Zealand fielders make appreciative noises. It was kind of risky, but it worked. Donald Barrett writes; I am jealous. I saw Shane Warne the musical in Sydney. I thoroughly enjoyed it. We actually saw it one day after flying back from LA where we had just attended Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle. Never say I don\u2019t have eclectic tastes. 54th over: England 143--2 (Burns 77, Root 50) Southee has the first over after lunch. The wind is coming over his right shoulder (thank you commentary) and he finds some swing. Root stretches to meet it, somewhat awkwardly. An aside, Rory Burn\u2019s moustache is visible through the grill from the other end of the pitch. I wonder if it might distract the bowler if he suddenly started to fixate on it. The camera pans down the pitch, it looks a cracker. Root and Burns walk back out. A lovely email from Will Webster, who needs some help from OBO-ers. When not watching cricket I am an artist of sorts and wondered if you or your readers might have some insight on a fairly odd cricket related photograph.A while ago the mystery of google randomly presented me with a video to watch about NZ legend Richard Hadlee which included a clip where the great man scored a 100 against West Indies in 1979 ( I think). Upon reaching three figures the celebrating Hadlee was confronted by a small boy who had run into the middle with his camera. The batsman duly posed a bit awkwardly, the child knelt, took the picture and scampered off. I wonder if anyone has seen the photograph the boy took? Google doesn\u2019t help any further, but maybe you have come across this, or similar images - it looks like nobody thought it unusual back in the day. I\u2019m pretty sure being so close to the action is not a viewpoint many people, except players, have had, and so I\u2019d be really curious to see what that snap looked like.Including a screen grab from the vid here. Keep up the good work. Winter wouldn\u2019t be the same without disturbed sleep patterns from checking the midnight cricket. My brother texts from Hamilton to say Fat Freddy\u2019s Drop are on the PA and everyone is mooching about the outfield in a laid-back surfer-dude way. The sun\u2019s probably out and he\u2019s got a flat white and some kind of elaborate pie too. What can the northern hemisphere fight back with? A joke, that\u2019s what. Cue Simon Lacey Not bad, Brian Withington, but you have to go a long way to beat: Two classics professors find themselves in a bar in downtown Mexico City. \u201cWhat would you care to drink, old chap?\u201d says one. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea, old boy, you decide,\u201d says the other. \u201cWell, would you decline a tequila?\u201d \u201cOh certainly, old thing - tequila, tequila, tequilam, tequilae, tequilae, tequila...\u201d 53rd over: England 142--2 (Burns 76, Root 50) The umpire plucks off the bails and that is lunch. England\u2019s session: no wickets, just steady, watchful accumulation, working through initial crankiness to find some moments of joy. I\u2019m off to make a quick drink but I\u2019ll leave you with Damian Clarke\u2019s lunchtime joke. On the subject of favourite jokes, may I tell you mine? How does an elephant ask for a bun? Can I have a bun, please? I realise that this is 90% a visual joke, but does that really matter? 52nd over: England 142--2 (Burns 76, Root 50) And with a tap towards square leg off Mitchell, that\u2019s Joe Root\u2019s fifty. He allows himself a bat wobble, but doesn\u2019t take his helmet off. Still work to do. Well played captain, under heavy pressure. 51st over: England 140--2 (Burns 76, Root 48) A Santner maiden. Lunch approaches. 50th over: England 140--2 (Burns 76, Root 48) Mitchell back into the attack and sends down a zinger on a good length, Root seems to turn it off his hip where it is caught behind the sticks. The umpire gives it out but Root REVIEWS immediately - a tell-tale sign. Sure enough, the third umpire\u2019s slow-mo proves there has been no contact between bat and pad JAmes Debens writes: \u201cWhat are \u201cAndy Flash shots\u201d? Are they like \u201cEddie Hemmings shuffles\u201d? Or \u201cChris broad strokes\u201d? Halp! 49th over: England 139--2 (Burns 76, Root 47) Frustration for Santner, it is a tidy over until he drifts onto the leg side with his last ball and Burns gets down on one knee and sweeps him down for four, like a man flicking a stray lump of coal back in the fire. 48th over: England 134--2 (Burns 72, Root 46) Burns and Root get the hee-bee-jeebies off their chest with a couple of quick singles off Henry, then Burns goes for a more expansive drive. The runs tick over. Morning Tanya, writes Avitaj Mitra. Morning! Joe Root is indeed looking good (and whisper it, but say it nonetheless).. he\u2019s probably due a really big score. Also, general observation. There\u2019s something very pleasant about watching a game in NZ at the end of the day. Low-key and laid-back. I agree. It\u2019s just the most idyllic way to watch Test cricket, Lining up barefoot for your coffee, letting the kids run semi-wild on the grass... 47th over: England 128--2 (Burns 67, Root 45) New Zealand playing the waiting game here. Santner turns out another maiden. Root plays a rather impatient swing to his last ball. Can England keep their nerve? Incidentally, why is Brian Blessed doing betting ads? (I once saw him as Old Deuteronomy in Cats and sat on his knee while getting his autograph. Innocent times) 45th over: England 126--2 (Burns 66, Root 44) A typically careful Santner over, and things have slowed down a bit here. Perhaps the batsmen feel lunch peering over their shoulders. At last another musicals fan on the OBO. Thank you Timothy Muller! I too enjoyed Dear Evan Hansen very much (and welled up a few times). I\u2019m not sure about the David Warner story, but I once had a conversation with Sir Tim Rice about writing a Basil D\u2019Oliveira musical together (I\u2019m an occasional composer). Sadly, he was too busy on Terms of Endearment at the time, and then was so shocked by the justifiably horrendous reception that got, that he basically retired. If anyone else feels like writing the book and the lyrics, (probably based on Peter Oborne\u2019s biography), let me know. Tim, shall we talk? 44th over: England 122--2 (Burns 64, Root 42) What a shot from Burns! He watches Henry run in with school boy purpose, and drives him with immaculate timing through mid-on for four. I see these two both making hundreds today. 43rd over: England 118--2 (Burns 60, Root 42) Oooh and ahhhs as Santner wheels in, long arm plucking the sun from the sky. Root plays out the maiden. And I\u2019m going to let Brian Withington tells us his joke, even though he first sent it in two days ago in relation to flip-flops and onomatopoeia. Two friends at a fun fair get separated, but one spots the other down below from her vantage point at the top of the helter-skelter. Trying to attract attention she resorts to calling out \u2018I\u2019m on a mat up here\u2019. 42nd over: England 118--2 (Burns 60, Root 42) Wagner does get his rest and Williamson flicks the ball to Matt Henry. He\u2019s on the money straight away, a good length, enough to put Root and Burns off andy flash shots. 41st over: England 117--2 (Burns 59, Root 40) Burns and Root watch Santner carefully. I think they sense danger. Just a couple of singles, and the morning moves on still England haven\u2019t lost a wicket. 40th over: England 115--2 (Burns 59, Root 40) Wagner storms in, his eighth over on the trot. Energy levels still high, but only one short ball. I think that\u2019s a sign it\u2019s time for a towel down. Stephen Owens writes from Motueka \u201cHi Tanya, A NZer here. I see the 3rd day preamble begins \u201cHello fellow time-zones-surfers, and welcome to day three of the second and final Test against New Zealand.\u201d Given that the Guardian is trying to \u2018reach out\u2019 [bloody horrible USA phrase that has become mainstream for other media] and enlarge coverage of NZ news, including, presumably, sports, maybe a more inclusive intro could have been used, say \u2018...the final test between England and New Zealand.\u201d I\u2019m reaching out here Tanya. Come Brexit England needs all the friends it can get, including its formerly loyal dominions before Edward Heath shafted the Commonwealth by signing up for the EU. Just saying... Stephen, you may have pre-empted an email from the sports editor pointing out just that. Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s asleep right now. Apologies, you\u2019re quite right. The question is, should I go back and change it now for any late-comers or do I have to leave my reaching out to next time? Stick with us New Zealanders, the EU has given up. 39th over: England 113--2 (Burns 58, Root 39) Aha! Mitchell Santner gets a go - can he prove England wrong for not picking a spinner? He encourages one to turn out of the rough and discomfort Rory Burns, hitting him high on the pad. A maiden. 38th over: England 113--2 (Burns 58, Root 39) Root content to play second fiddle as Wagner continues to fire them in. 37th over: England 111--2 (Burns 58, Root 38) Burns lives dangerously off Daryl Mitchell. He pushes forwards and the ball zings dangerously between gullies. He looks anxiously over his shoulder. Then he flicks one, most charmingly, over mid-wicket for another boundary. New Zealand leaking more runs than they\u2019d like here. Thinking about your words Ian Forth. I know the Pakistan attack isn\u2019t the best but he has beaten Bradman! Talking of which, if we can time travel, how about to Adelaide 1933? The drama! 36th over: England 102--2 (Burns 50, Root 37) Burns turns Wagner off his legs for a single, and that\u2019s his fifty! Eight fours, 158 minutes. and an impressive test of nerve after being dropped twice yesterday evening and tested by tight New Zealand bowling this morning. He\u2019s both awkward and solid. And that\u2019s drinks. Ian Forth is not impressed by my suggestion of a new musical: \u201cI don\u2019t want to start a heated debate all over again, but I\u2019m not sure David Warner scoring a heap of runs against an undercooked attack at home constitutes a narrative arc Spielberg will be considering. (Australia have, after all, won 12 out of 12 against Pakistan at home this century). He needs to walk from Cape York to Cape Town for charity or at least rescue a cat from a tree.\u201d 35th over: England 99-2 (Burns 48, Root 36) Michell, red soles trailing behind him, runs in. A slower ball, Burns is foxed and top-edges a pull... just short of square leg. Now that is a wonderful suggestion. 34th over: England 95-2 (Burns 46, Root 33) Wagner charges in, steam emerging from ears and nose, pistons moving legs and arm. Just one from over. \u201cA very good morning Tanya,\u201d writes Brian Withington. Morning Brian! Pleased to read of Atherton\u2019s reference to Joe Root looking good - would love to see him follow David Warner and go very big indeed today (and tomorrow). Meanwhile I\u2019m patiently waiting for any excuse to resubmit my lonely linguistic joke about onomatopoeia ... Oh go on Brian - send it to me again. 33rd over: England 94-2 (Burns 46, Root 33) Mitchell again. I love watching him bowl, you notice a different idiosyncrasy with every over - this time it is his spread fingers in his non-ball gripping hand. Root takes a good stride forward, sends his head over his knee, and plays an immaculate defensive shot. A maiden. 32nd over: England 94-2 (Burns 46, Root 33) A maiden over for Wagner. Not without danger for Burns who is deceived by an off-cutter. Patience. Not long till drinks. 31st over: England 94-2 (Burns 46, Root 33) Williamson turns to Daryl Mitchell, who does a funny quick-step at the top of his run, before steaming in with his high-knee-ed approach. Root watches carefully for five balls then flicks him for an easy four. I am pleased to say that in the next three months I will be watching an England Test match below Table Mountain at Newlands during the New Year Test, and then below Galle Fort in Sri Lanka in March, writes Neil Waterfield. I can think of two no finer grounds in the world, but will be happy to find others. You lucky thing! Beautiful grounds in amazing surroundings. 30th over: England 89-2 (Burns 46, Root 29) Burns does sticks his bum out at the crease, he must have great quads. But enough of that - pow! - that\u2019s quite a shot, with straight arms he swats Wagner to the boundary. Next one is short again, and Burns swivels pulls again behind square for another four. England rock\u2019in on. 29th over: England 80-2 (Burns 38, Root 28) Burns is looking good here. He\u2019s over the nerves and hitting crisply. He dispatches Southee with a whizz-crack to the boundary with a sharp pull. Peter Salmon has his mind on David Warner. Do you think Stuart Broad would have been looking at Warner\u2019s innings yesterday and thinking, well, that would have taken me about four balls? 28th over: England 76-2 (Burns 34, Root 28) Root eyes up a short one from Wagner, swivels and pulls him for four. Lovely. And again, though with not quite as much power and just gets the single. Then a fine on-drive from Burns which is cut off just before the rope. Next ball he\u2019s crunched in the chest by a short one. This Wagner, he makes thing happen. And that\u2019s the fifty partnership between Root and Burns. Chris Bull has listed his top grounds on the fantasy trip: Antigua - the recreation ground. Cape town. Dharamsala. Adelaide. Galle. Wellington. If its ever safe enough again Srinigar would be in there. 27th over: England 68-2 (Burns 31, Root 23) Southee again, no real threat, but tight. Burns gets four leg byes past a desperate Watling. 26th over: England 64-2 (Burns 31, Root 23) Aha! New Zealand turn to Wagner to see if he can extract some zing from this pitch. He shoves one in short with every effort of his visible being, the polar opposite of Jofra Archer - whose effort is seemingly effortless - and Burns ducks and it pings off his shoulder for a single. Root ducks the next In answer to your question William, if I could magic myself to these places so that I didn\u2019t have to worry about my carbon footprint: I\u2019d go to Eden Gardens and Barbados (neither of which I\u2019ve been to), then Sydney, where I could visit my brother, then one of the lovely small New Zealand grounds - happy to be advised - where I could meet my other brother and .... 25th over: England 59-2 (Burns 29, Root 21) We get a close up of Root, eyes darting hither and thither from under his helmet. Southee bowls and Root looks uncomfortable, his feet static. Better next ball, full face of the bat. He nods. 24th over: England 57-2 (Burns 29, Root 19) Henry testing here with his line, but Burns and Root resist doing anything silly. Half an hour safely negociated. 23rd over: England 55-2 (Burns 28, Root 18) Just a couple from Southee\u2019s over - this feels like a crucial first hour. Both these two have the ability to bat big, but are vulnerable early on. William Hargreaves poses an interesting question 22nd over: England 54-2 (Burns 28, Root 17) Henry and Watling have an earnest chat. A few balls later, Root glove/pulls him, slightly uncomfortably down for four. Thank you Johns Potter and Little for pointing out that England are batting not New Zealand... Also, and apropros of nothing, I saw Dear Evan Hansen last night (if you love a good emotional roller-coaster with cracking songs, I recommend it). Surely The David Warner story has got to be a musical. Did anyone see Shane Warne the musical? 21st over: England 49-2 (Burns 28, Root 13) The grass stripes either side of the wicket are very defined, all lime candy cane. Joe Root brings the England fifty up with a confident-looking pull off Southee. 20th over: England 49-2 (Burns 28, Root 12) At the other end, we have Matt Henry, and Joe Root sends him scurrying for four, a back foot push through backward point. Burns then plays a slightly less confident looking shot, which squeezes through third man for another boundary We get a wide-lens view of the ground - it\u2019s gorgeous, green and very pleasant. Trees, grassy knolls, picnics and a few half-hearted clouds. 19th over: England 40-2 (Burns 24, Root 7) Southee bowls the first over of the day, just a single from it, a back foot push from Root. A discordant version of Jerusalem drifts across the ground. TMS tells me the players are out, but the TV is running rather behind ... this could be interesting... We need to talk about David Warner. What a story - boy from the wrong sides of the tracks, proves the doubters wrong, falls dramatically from grace, then redemption. Interesting. Atherton is backing Root to make runs today. He\u2019s been watching him in the nets, and \u201che\u2019s been hitting the ball beautifully.\u201d He\u2019s tougher, Athers adds, than his angelic features might suggest. There\u2019s a christmas tree in the Sky studio. The mood in there is moderately dark. Mark Butcher says Joe Root, \u201chas to go out and make a big one.\u201d Out on the ground, Ian Ward and Mike Atherton are talking to Jos Buttler. Wardy admires Jos \u201cbeasting it\u201d in the gym. Athers asks how Joe Root is coping with the pressure,\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know any different,\u201d says Buttler. \u201cHe manages himself very well. Cream always rises to the top, his batting form will come back, probably today.\u201d Hello fellow time-zones-surfers, and welcome to day three of the second and final Test against New Zealand. They\u2019re starting half an hour early today (9.30pm GMT, 10.30am NZST) in Hamilton, still making up for the grotty weather that truncated day one. New Zealand are whistling to the ground this morning, their bow ties perky, their trainers bouncy - two English wickets down with only 39 on the board. All is not lost for England, but two of the newbies failed to endure a nasty final session of 21 overs yesterday evening. Unfortunate Dom Sibley, never the nimblest, was cuffed on the helmet and then on the box on the way to being bowled by a leg-stump half volley. Joe Denly prodded at a wobbler from Matt Henry and was well caught by BJ Watling behind the sticks. The two men who will walk out this morning are Rory Burns, dropped twice yesterday, and Joe Root, suddenly under reams of news-print pressure over the captaincy. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got to go and bat 150 overs here to set up the game on day five,\u201d Stuart Broad said. \u201cOur opportunity is there...Here we\u2019re not batting with a scoreboard of 500. They made 375. So, I think our pressure is reduced slightly and we just go and play.\u201d If you\u2019re a batsman, you\u2019d want to bat out there, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d he added helpfully. \u201cIf you were good at batting, you\u2019d fancy that.\u201d Let\u2019s see hey Stuart. In other news, poor Jack Leach is still in hospital with gastroenteritis, .",

      "body": "<p>No Donald Duck suit, no Mozart wig, not too many bells and whistles.

Getting their trust was difficult.</p> <p>The interviews were conducted in Mandarin by a former Chinese journalism student who has now graduated, and on the understanding that the students not be identified. Several, particularly those who were critical of their home country, worried about the consequences of their names being known.</p> <p>International education is <a href=\"https://dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/trade-at-a-glance/Pages/top-goods-services.aspx\">one of Australia\u2019s largest export industries</a>, coming in fourth<strong> </strong>behind coal, iron ore and the natural gas industry.

It\u2019s a massive business that is transforming our cities, with student accommodation driving much of the high-rise apartment boom, and noodle and bubble tea shops springing up in the streets around university campuses.</p> <p>Chinese students represent about one-third of the students who come to Australia, but bring in a larger proportion of the money because they gravitate to the more expensive, prestigious universities.</p> <p>So what do Chinese students make of the debates that swirl around them? Does their Australian education alter their attitudes to their home country? And how do they process western media coverage of the Hong Kong protests and the anxieties about China\u2019s rise? Are they altered by their education, or do they only seek to alter us?</p> <p>A complex human picture emerged from our interviews. Some of our subjects envied and aspired to the free-thinking education available in Australia. Others thought such freedoms were appropriate for the west but not for China.</p> <p>Some didn\u2019t feel safe here.</p> <p>They noticed different things: cleaner streets than at home, but also racism, and what they perceived as shallow cultural roots.</p> <p>For some, love of country was the same as loyalty to the Chinese Communist party. Others drew a distinction between love of China and love of its government.</p> <p>They talked about media censorship at home, and the great firewall of China which prevents internet access to international media.</p> <p>There were lots of different views and attitudes but a common thread was an increased national pride and confidence. This is China\u2019s time, many said. They want to be part of a better future for China even if they don\u2019t necessarily agree on what that might mean.</p> <h2>Wendy</h2> <p>Wendy is studying a master\u2019s of media and communications.

If another system fitted into the historical stage, the society may still have developed well.</em></p> <p><em>I was brought up in the Chinese education system, so I learned the idea of respecting your teacher and his teaching. China is a country with clear hierarchies, and the teacher is in a high position. Most of the time we don\u2019t have the guts to question what we are taught. I want to choose what kind of life I want to live and what ideas and values I want to believe. After I lived abroad, this feeling became stronger.

So many people are grateful. I think being grateful is good. But making your people live a peaceful and happy life is not a bonus, but an obligation for any party.</em></p> <p><em>As a former educator, I very much hope China will become a well-educated, civilised country.

And I am against looking at the west with only Chinese values. The conflict between the two is irreconcilable. Each media cannot help being biased when reporting foreign news. I understand that the Chinese government restricts and controls the media because otherwise social conflicts would be too intense. From my perspective, the great firewall of China shouldn\u2019t be there, while from the government\u2019s perspective it is an effective way to guide public opinion. There are too many people; you cannot handle them. That is the thinking.</em></p> <p><em>I think some Chinese people don\u2019t have much national confidence. If you cannot accept criticism, then you are not confident. I think national confidence is that I\u2019m not afraid of others\u2019 words.</em></p> <p><em>I hope China and Australia come to understand each other with an open mind. When you criticise China\u2019s system, you need to understand China\u2019s position and its history, instead of criticising only from the position of a liberal democracy.</em></p> <p><em>I hope Chinese people come to have more compassion.

As world power transfers, some people need to stand out and question the west.</em></p> <p><em>I\u2019m a nationalist. I therefore think of the western world as being in the opposite position to me. It is dominant, but it should be China that is dominant. Since the industrial revolution it has been the westerners who dominated the world. Now the trend is towards China.</em></p> <p><em>I think one of our problems is that before we did not see the western nations as our enemy. Now we should, in a little part of ourselves, see the west as an enemy. When our country was not strong, we wanted to keep a low profile. We could not be too aggressive. But now we have more power we shouldn\u2019t be like we have been in the past.</em></p> <p><em>Western media are too strong. China needs the great firewall to guard against the influence from an untested value system of the west. Democracy and freedom seem to be right because the west has developed to be so dominant. But these ideas have never been tested by history. China has too many people and the level of education is limited, so it\u2019s hard to gain stability if public opinion is influenced by the untested values from outside.</em></p> <p><em>As for the issue of the South China sea, it is survival of the fittest. These countries in the region are pitiful. You have demands in front of China but you don\u2019t have the power. Then don\u2019t speak! Just as when the United States was powerful, so China did not get full sovereignty in the South China sea.</em></p> <p><em>Australia is not important in my expectations about the future. It just follows the US. The future of China is about surpassing the US, which is our competitor. Actually we are not \u2018climbing\u2019 to No 1. We were No 1 in history. We are simply reviving and \u2018going back\u2019 to the No 1 place.</em></p> <p><em>Under the western system, they separate the love of country from the love of government. But is this correct? You cannot use the western system to judge ours. The western system is not right for all societies.</em></p> <p><em>The Chinese Communist party is great, but we have to acknowledge it didn\u2019t do very well on some things. Our system has the ability to correct its errors. It is wrong to talk about China\u2019s problems to outsiders. When you are strong enough you can talk about your problems, because you don\u2019t care \u2013 you are already the strongest, such as America now. But China is not at this stage. Some problems, we know them ourselves and solve them by ourselves. But don\u2019t talk about them to others.</em></p> <p><em>From the beginning I thought western countries were behind the Hong Kong protests. I think the protesters have problems. Working hard or studying hard is enough. Why do these meaningless things? Freedom and democracy \u2026 are they basic needs of human beings? \u2026 I think they are just a dream weaved by western media.</em></p> <p><em>Hong Kong\u2019s problem is far more complicated than we as individuals can solve. Therefore we need to believe in the Chinese Communist party and the Hong Kong government\u2019s wisdom. They will solve it in the best way.</em></p> <p><em>I want to contribute to my country and the people. The most ideal way is to get into the ministry of foreign affairs and become a diplomat.

So my position is in the middle.</em></p> <p><em>I hope Chinese people can be more confident, culturally and nationally. I think differently about this confidence to many Chinese people. I think confidence means acknowledging both good and bad things and facing them frankly. A lot of radical patriots find it ear-piercing when hearing any criticism. This reaction actually shows you are not confident enough. If I am truly confident, I accept all the strengths and weaknesses of myself.</em></p> <p><em>I get my news from Weibo, Instagram and WeChat. I normally wouldn\u2019t figure out whether the information is true or not, because I know all of it must be polished. I naturally believe that each piece of news is half true and half fake.</em></p> <p><em>Fake news might be ethically wrong but sometimes there are no other choices. If you completely release the truth it may arouse social panic. Some people may not be as calm as me. They are more likely to be provoked and may cause some unknown consequences. From this angle, media control is excusable. So I think fake news is not completely wrong.</em></p> <p><em>As for the Hong Kong protests, expressing your appeals lawfully is not wrong.

      "bodyText": "Chinese students in Australia have been accused of trying to stifle freedom of speech on campus, of attacking pro-democracy protesters and of undermining the quality of education at our top universities which are increasingly dependent on the money they bring. They stand at the centre of many of our political debates as we navigate the increasing influence of China in our region, its attempts to infiltrate our politics and institutions, and Australia\u2019s increasing economic dependence. In all this, the voices of individual Chinese students are rarely heard. Over the past 10 weeks Guardian Australia has interviewed Chinese students studying in Australia in an attempt to get at the humanity and the diversity behind the headlines. Most of those we approached felt that the Australian media was hostile to them, always writing about Chinese in Australia as a threat. Getting their trust was difficult. The interviews were conducted in Mandarin by a former Chinese journalism student who has now graduated, and on the understanding that the students not be identified. Several, particularly those who were critical of their home country, worried about the consequences of their names being known. International education is one of Australia\u2019s largest export industries, coming in fourth behind coal, iron ore and the natural gas industry. But the education of young people is a more complex business than digging up and shipping out coal and ore. International students bring in an estimated $35.2bn, or 8% of total exports. It\u2019s a massive business that is transforming our cities, with student accommodation driving much of the high-rise apartment boom, and noodle and bubble tea shops springing up in the streets around university campuses. Chinese students represent about one-third of the students who come to Australia, but bring in a larger proportion of the money because they gravitate to the more expensive, prestigious universities. So what do Chinese students make of the debates that swirl around them? Does their Australian education alter their attitudes to their home country? And how do they process western media coverage of the Hong Kong protests and the anxieties about China\u2019s rise? Are they altered by their education, or do they only seek to alter us? A complex human picture emerged from our interviews. Some of our subjects envied and aspired to the free-thinking education available in Australia. Others thought such freedoms were appropriate for the west but not for China. Some didn\u2019t feel safe here. They noticed different things: cleaner streets than at home, but also racism, and what they perceived as shallow cultural roots. For some, love of country was the same as loyalty to the Chinese Communist party. Others drew a distinction between love of China and love of its government. They talked about media censorship at home, and the great firewall of China which prevents internet access to international media. There were lots of different views and attitudes but a common thread was an increased national pride and confidence. This is China\u2019s time, many said. They want to be part of a better future for China even if they don\u2019t necessarily agree on what that might mean. Wendy Wendy is studying a master\u2019s of media and communications. She has worked as a teacher of Chinese language in Thailand and Britain. I love my country. I love traditional Chinese culture, the verses, the ditties, odes and songs in Chinese history and the heritage left by ancient people. I\u2019m not a believer in socialism. I think so-called socialism now is not exactly as it was defined originally. Socialism happened to be the right way for China at a specific historical stage. If another system fitted into the historical stage, the society may still have developed well. I was brought up in the Chinese education system, so I learned the idea of respecting your teacher and his teaching. China is a country with clear hierarchies, and the teacher is in a high position. Most of the time we don\u2019t have the guts to question what we are taught. I want to choose what kind of life I want to live and what ideas and values I want to believe. After I lived abroad, this feeling became stronger. I hope Chinese students in Australia can get rid of their biased thinking, their mental block and fixed mindset, to accept some new ideas and values. I thought that the students who attacked the Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrations represented a group of people who are brainwashed and have lost the ability for critical thinking. They do not represent all international students. They gathered in patriotism parades and shouted dirty words and didn\u2019t allow others to question. They didn\u2019t know what the Hong Kong demonstrators were demanding. They didn\u2019t allow any questioning of the authorities. There\u2019s an old saying: scholars need to question. Only questioning can make progress. If we lose the spirit of questioning, how can our society and country improve? Many mainland Chinese people are brainwashed too severely. I am not a secessionist. I certainly hope China would become a unified country. But if Hong Kong and Taiwan have different ideas, I support them too. The people living on those lands are the people who have the right to choose, not us, who are not living on those lands. I support social stability, but not by brainwashing. This stability is a fake stability. But the worry is that if people have the right to choose, the options will be too many for the huge population. The Chinese Communist party dragged China out of war. So many people are grateful. I think being grateful is good. But making your people live a peaceful and happy life is not a bonus, but an obligation for any party. As a former educator, I very much hope China will become a well-educated, civilised country. China develops very fast. The rising power of one country will always make others nervous. Our nation leaves a not so gentle impression on others, not as gentle as in history. Australia and China understand each other more than many other countries do. But in term of understanding, you can never have too much. Yao Yao is a PhD student in Melbourne, researching Chinese media. She comes from Shaanxi province. I am a patriot. Patriotism is hoping the country and the people will be better. The government exists to serve the people. If you serve the people well, yes I can love you. Loving my country and loving the Chinese Communist party surely should be separated. But we are always told that China and the CCP are the same. I watch Chinese and western media. I am against looking at China only with western values. And I am against looking at the west with only Chinese values. The conflict between the two is irreconcilable. Each media cannot help being biased when reporting foreign news. I understand that the Chinese government restricts and controls the media because otherwise social conflicts would be too intense. From my perspective, the great firewall of China shouldn\u2019t be there, while from the government\u2019s perspective it is an effective way to guide public opinion. There are too many people; you cannot handle them. That is the thinking. I think some Chinese people don\u2019t have much national confidence. If you cannot accept criticism, then you are not confident. I think national confidence is that I\u2019m not afraid of others\u2019 words. I hope China and Australia come to understand each other with an open mind. When you criticise China\u2019s system, you need to understand China\u2019s position and its history, instead of criticising only from the position of a liberal democracy. I hope Chinese people come to have more compassion. Don\u2019t just care about your surroundings, know more about the world. Don\u2019t restrict your opinions in China. Look at the world. It\u2019s so big. As Chinese society develops, it is good that education becomes more mobile. I support this kind of globalisation. Shao Shao came to Australia one year ago. He was raised in Anhui province, and has done voluntary work in Africa and gained a degree in psychology in China. He is studying strategic communications. China hasn\u2019t been very powerful. But now we are powerful enough to not tolerate what we shouldn\u2019t tolerate. As world power transfers, some people need to stand out and question the west. I\u2019m a nationalist. I therefore think of the western world as being in the opposite position to me. It is dominant, but it should be China that is dominant. Since the industrial revolution it has been the westerners who dominated the world. Now the trend is towards China. I think one of our problems is that before we did not see the western nations as our enemy. Now we should, in a little part of ourselves, see the west as an enemy. When our country was not strong, we wanted to keep a low profile. We could not be too aggressive. But now we have more power we shouldn\u2019t be like we have been in the past. Western media are too strong. China needs the great firewall to guard against the influence from an untested value system of the west. Democracy and freedom seem to be right because the west has developed to be so dominant. But these ideas have never been tested by history. China has too many people and the level of education is limited, so it\u2019s hard to gain stability if public opinion is influenced by the untested values from outside. As for the issue of the South China sea, it is survival of the fittest. These countries in the region are pitiful. You have demands in front of China but you don\u2019t have the power. Then don\u2019t speak! Just as when the United States was powerful, so China did not get full sovereignty in the South China sea. Australia is not important in my expectations about the future. It just follows the US. The future of China is about surpassing the US, which is our competitor. Actually we are not \u2018climbing\u2019 to No 1. We were No 1 in history. We are simply reviving and \u2018going back\u2019 to the No 1 place. Under the western system, they separate the love of country from the love of government. But is this correct? You cannot use the western system to judge ours. The western system is not right for all societies. The Chinese Communist party is great, but we have to acknowledge it didn\u2019t do very well on some things. Our system has the ability to correct its errors. It is wrong to talk about China\u2019s problems to outsiders. When you are strong enough you can talk about your problems, because you don\u2019t care \u2013 you are already the strongest, such as America now. But China is not at this stage. Some problems, we know them ourselves and solve them by ourselves. But don\u2019t talk about them to others. From the beginning I thought western countries were behind the Hong Kong protests. I think the protesters have problems. Working hard or studying hard is enough. Why do these meaningless things? Freedom and democracy \u2026 are they basic needs of human beings? \u2026 I think they are just a dream weaved by western media. Hong Kong\u2019s problem is far more complicated than we as individuals can solve. Therefore we need to believe in the Chinese Communist party and the Hong Kong government\u2019s wisdom. They will solve it in the best way. I want to contribute to my country and the people. The most ideal way is to get into the ministry of foreign affairs and become a diplomat. It would be better if I become an ambassador. I cannot only help our fellow people overseas but also promote the image of China. Venus Venus is from Xi\u2019an, in Shaanxi province, and is studying marketing. She has joined the campus Chinese debating team because she enjoys thinking critically. I am a confident person \u2013 70% of my confidence may come from my personality; 30% comes from a strong country behind me. China does well in patriotism education. We are instilled with the national sense of honour at a very young age. We are educated that everyone needs to contribute to the development of the country and society. I don\u2019t love every part of China, but I\u2019ll accept its good and bad things. I\u2019ll face them. I think this is a healthy love. My parents are not perfect but I love them. My love for the country is a bit like this. I study to understand China\u2019s history and culture. I think understanding is the first step of love. Second, I will defend my country \u2013 not irrationally, but more spiritually. If I meet a foreigner and talk about political issues, I will acknowledge our shortcomings and say it\u2019s OK, we will try to improve. The party and the country are bonded. This is something we cannot deny. Personally I separate them. I will only say I love the country. The history and culture I love is not created by the party. I don\u2019t understand the party very much. In my family, half are CCP members and half are not. So my position is in the middle. I hope Chinese people can be more confident, culturally and nationally. I think differently about this confidence to many Chinese people. I think confidence means acknowledging both good and bad things and facing them frankly. A lot of radical patriots find it ear-piercing when hearing any criticism. This reaction actually shows you are not confident enough. If I am truly confident, I accept all the strengths and weaknesses of myself. I get my news from Weibo, Instagram and WeChat. I normally wouldn\u2019t figure out whether the information is true or not, because I know all of it must be polished. I naturally believe that each piece of news is half true and half fake. Fake news might be ethically wrong but sometimes there are no other choices. If you completely release the truth it may arouse social panic. Some people may not be as calm as me. They are more likely to be provoked and may cause some unknown consequences. From this angle, media control is excusable. So I think fake news is not completely wrong. As for the Hong Kong protests, expressing your appeals lawfully is not wrong. I think Hongkongers should lawfully express their appeal while not resorting to extreme, violent and even terroristic ways. I am a patriot so I spiritually support territorial integrity and oppose independence of Hong Kong. Miami Miami was raised in Hebei and learned English in China. He played rap with African Americans at home, and was deeply influenced by American street culture. He is studying strategic communications. When I saw our military force in the military parade on our national day, I wanted to cry. This is the strongest national confidence. Like president Xi said, there is hard power and soft power. Soft power is our culture. Soft power can also bring national confidence. But personally I value hard power more. Australia embraces all cultures while losing its own. It feels like a Chinatown. I can even communicate in Chinese in the city. Australia sits on the fence. I don\u2019t really care about Australian opinions. Australia\u2019s opinion on political issues follows that of the US. At first in Australia I really wanted to jump out of my circle and communicate more with Australians but I found I couldn\u2019t do it. It was more efficient to communicate with Chinese. I sometimes played rap with some black people in China but here I find that street culture is not popular. Australian ways of communicating are quite different from American ways. Enduring loneliness is a compulsory course when studying overseas. Yet I have found the joy of learning here in Australia. The cramming method of teaching in China is completely different. In China the teacher will teach you everything and tell you what to do in each step. People may think this is more efficient in the short term. Personally I choose the western education but there\u2019s nothing wrong with the Chinese way. We must understand that China has a huge population. It\u2019s impossible to have everyone doing their own thinking. I think white people intrinsically have a sense of superiority. I have experienced discrimination at the university. When I was seeking some information about my subjects, the white person there was laughing all the time. I asked her why and she said she couldn\u2019t understand my accent. She found another person, another white guy. When I was talking, they both started laughing. I want to go back to China because my country is not strong enough. It\u2019s already very strong but not enough. I hope it has more voice worldwide. I want to contribute to this course. Some people go abroad to stay there. Some people go abroad to integrate the foreign culture into their way of thinking. I\u2019m the second kind of person. I can go back to China and solve problems in a Chinese way but from a global perspective, to make my country better. I was angry about the Hong Kong protests at the beginning. I thought the protesters had forgotten their origins. Now I feel that this isn\u2019t an issue any more. I see them as clowns. They won\u2019t influence us much now. All they can do is influence some public opinions worldwide. I don\u2019t want to see western media discussing this. Your discussions are making it harder for us (China and Hong Kong) to live peacefully. It\u2019s like I want to reconcile with my husband while western countries are like a mistress sabotaging us, making the process slower and slower. Hong Kong is part of China. China always sees Hong Kong as a son. A special son. This son may not be so intimate to us. But we need them to understand the parent more. The leaders will have their solutions. Of course I hope it\u2019s peacefully solved. I want to see my country peaceful and stable. Ethan Ethan came to Australia on the advice of a relative after failing to get good enough marks to enter a good university in China. He studied English at school in Jiangsu province and was strongly drawn to all things foreign. He is studying accounting. One thing that struck me here is that people clean the streets. In China people care only about their own spaces and the public space is the dirtiest. I like this about Australia. The sense of community here is great. I was a person who worshipped and had blind faith in foreign things when I was in China. After I came to Australia, I found there were not strong cultural roots here. I look back at China and think that I was shallow in my love of foreign things. China is not shallow. China has very deep historical roots. We are the generation under the one child policy. I have to say we are spoiled. As long as you are the only child, your parents\u2019 investment in you makes you less independent compared with the children here. I don\u2019t accept the pure pursuit of individualism. I\u2019m still a Chinese and I\u2019m still family-centred. People here say to me, \u2018You should move out of home\u2019 and \u2018You don\u2019t need to give the money to your parents because it\u2019s your money.\u2019 I can understand, but I won\u2019t do this.

Those who are easily influenced are kept inside, but those of us who know how to use a VPN can easily get over it, and we have enough knowledge to distinguish between right and wrong. But it keeps those who are too easily influenced by western values inside. Sally Sally has completed a master of journalism course in Australia and has remained here after graduating, working with Australian journalists writing about China. I came to Australia because my mum thought it was a good place for immigration. I didn\u2019t really experience much cultural shock as I humbled myself to learn more about all aspects of Australia. My friendship circle consists of local people mostly from church and some international students. Compared with Shanghai, Melbourne is not safe as there are more crimes around me. But it depends on how you define \u2018safe\u2019. As a journalist, Australia is way safer than China.

Sheep spend 50 minutes in the chamber, and must be measured twice with an interval of more than 14 days. The resulting data is used alongside other genetic information to calculate a \u201cmethane breeding value\u201d. Farmers who want to participate are expected to have access to breeding rams within two years, given the time it takes to breed the rams on a commercial scale. The pastoral greenhouse gas research consortium, which is jointly funded by the agricultural sector and the government, said the concept was to take advantage of variations in levels of methane emissions and research that found the differences were passed on to the next generation. \u201cThis is a global first for any species of livestock,\u201d the consortium\u2019s general manager, Mark Aspin, said. \u201cLaunching the methane breeding value gives New Zealand\u2019s sheep sector a practical tool to help lower our agricultural greenhouse gases.

      "bodyText": "Online e-cigarette sales looked like a promising industry for Edwin Wong when he started his venture a year ago. The 34-year-old had studied Shenzhen\u2019s businesses and products since 2012, and saw a sure bet. Soon, he had developed a loyal base of more than 600 repeat customers and business was steady. But suddenly, everything changed. Overnight his 2.2m yuan (\u00a3240,000) investment in a startup, called KiwiPod, disappeared. \u201cA lot of people have gone into this business who never knew anything about the business before, they just threw money into it. Most just thought it was hot, very profitable, and now they are gone,\u201d he says. Searching Chinese e-commerce platforms such as Taobao or JD.com for \u201ce-cigarettes\u201d \u2013 something that would normally yield thousands of options \u2013 revealed nothing. It was as if the online shops never existed. Rumours were rampant of at least two suicides among the throngs of small-time sellers whose business model had disappeared. The day everything changed was 7 November, when Chinese authorities suddenly imposed a de facto ban on e-cigarettes, issuing an order discouraging online sales to protect children from the hazards of smoking. The order came out just before China\u2019s biggest annual online shopping holiday, on the 11th. China is the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer and exporter of e-cigarettes, according to the China Electronic Cigarette Chamber of Commerce. In 2018, more than 2 million people worked in the industry, with annual sales worth 33.7bn yuan (\u00a33.7bn) and exports worth 28.7bn yuan (\u00a33.2bn). In Shenzhen, a city just north of Hong Kong, about 90% of the world\u2019s vaping and e-cigarette devices are designed and manufactured in about 1,000 factories. Thousands more companies form the supply chain throughout Guangdong province and China. The industry is in damage control after an outbreak of vaping-related respiratory ailments led to at least 39 deaths across the US. The US Center for Disease Control is blaming the additive vitamin E acetate used in some e-liquids, and says most of the cases were associated with smoking of THC oils, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana. US president Donald Trump is meeting industry and health representatives, amid indications that the final policy in the US would balance health concerns with economic ones. The US market has already shrunk by about a quarter. Last week, New York City lawmakers voted to ban flavoured e-cigarettes. The measure, which Democratic mayor Bill de Blasio says he supports, bans all e-cigarette and e-liquid flavours except tobacco. It is expected to take effect in July next year. A city in limbo In Shenzhen, the bigger players have fared better than the smaller sellers, and life for them goes on as normal, for now. The six-storey Teslacigs factory is easily missed from the road in Shajing, sitting behind a tangle of tropical brush and amidst a cluster of similar dust-stained buildings. Inside, about 400 workers quietly assemble new pods and other vaping devices in a pristine, dust-free, temperature-controlled environment, a far cry from the dusty world outside. The factory shows no signs of slowing down.

While the FDA says the cost of the review process, which will be determined in May next year, would top out at about $460,000, those in the industry in Shezhen expect it to be much higher. One manufacturer who did not want to be identified, says it will likely cost his business $10m in set-up costs and business registration, and then about $5m for each individual barcoded item. \u2018People knew there was something coming\u2019 Qasim Shah is the co-founder of STIG International, helping build a multi-million dollar vaping business in Shenzhen over the past decade.
