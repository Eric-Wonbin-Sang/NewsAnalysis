While state media have frequently reported statements made by Xi, he had not been seen in public since a meeting with the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on 29 January and a meeting with the Cambodian prime minister, Hun Sen, in Beijing on 5 February. He has not been shown visiting doctors or hospitals or patients or visiting Wuhan. Instead, he sent his second-in-command, the premier, Li Keqiang.</p> <p>Observers say Xi may have been insulating himself from the public fallout from the crisis, making it easier to blame local officials. Others have pointed out that he is doing what several other Chinese leaders before have done during times of crisis of stepping back from the limelight while still maintaining firm control. Internet users have joked that he may have found a safe place to quarantine himself.</p> <p>Now that the central government has taken control of the handling of the outbreak, it may be harder to deflect blame. Moreover, the top leadership is also facing an outpouring of public anger over the recent death of a doctor who was punished for trying to warn colleagues and friends about the virus. Xi may not have the luxury of staying in the background. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-10T12:07:25.147Z\">at 12.07pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e4139c58f0811db2faf4cc5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-10T11:11:10.170Z\">11.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Public Health England is speaking to people who have had close and sustained contact with the new confirmed cases. </p> <p>Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of national infection service at Public Health England, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These new cases are all closely linked and were rapidly identified through Public Health England\u2019s comprehensive contact tracing approach and tested quickly. </p> <p>Our priority is speaking to those people who have had close and sustained contact with confirmed cases so that we can advise them on what they can do to limit the spread of the virus.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-10T11:12:28.387Z\">at 11.12am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e41321e8f086a28115a8e38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-10T10:55:00.475Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A growing number of countries across the world are evacuating or planning to evacuate their citizens from parts of China hit by coronavirus.</p> <p>Reuters has collated a list of the countries who have evacuated some of their citizens so far: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Kazakhstan</strong> will send two planes to China on 10 and 11 February to evacuate its citizens.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us on this blog, though our coverage will continue overnight in a new live blog. Here\u2019s a summary of the events since we last wrapped things up about 16 hours ago. The new coronavirus represents a serious and imminent threat to public health, the UK\u2019s health secretary declared. The step gave the government additional powers to fight the spread of the virus. Eight people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK out of 1,114 tested. The figures were released by the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and meant the number of confirmed cases had doubled. If you\u2019d like to read more, my colleagues Denis Campbell and Frances Perraudin have the full story: China\u2019s Hubei province confirms a total of 31,728 cases of Coronavirus and 974 deaths by the end of today, the Reuters news agency reports. That number includes 103 new deaths and 2,097 new cases, according to the report. A student at the University of Sussex is being tested after falling ill, the institution has said. A spokeswoman has told the Guardian: We can confirm that a student on our campus has been admitted to hospital today for tests. A case of coronavirus has not been confirmed at this point. The student had recently returned from overseas. We are following all Public Health England guidance in terms of practical next steps and we will be keeping our students and staff at the university informed if there are any developments. This is a difficult time for the young person involved, and their fellow students, and we are concerned at making sure they are supported. The Girls\u2019 Schools Association has echoed legal experts\u2019 advice to independent institutions to discourage their students from flying to China. The body even warned that people flying back in from south-east Asia could face quarantine upon their return to the UK. A spokeswoman has said: We have recommended that our schools advise parents, carers and guardians of any pupils proposing to travel to south-east Asia over February half-term to consider not travelling. We have also advised schools that, where possible, they should help to make suitable alternative arrangements with guardians. In the case of students who decide to travel, we have recommended that schools advise them and their families that protective measures could well be in place before they return and that they prepare for the possibility of quarantine procedures. In its guidance, the Boarding Schools\u2019 Association says institutions must also consider the risk of any visits by parents or carers, avoiding \u201cunnecessary restrictions\u201d on anyone beyond the 14-day incubation period. It says schools must ensure boarders are protected both on and off the premises, following reports of children being targeted on the basis of their ethnicity. China sends more pupils to UK fee-paying schools than any other country. British Airways has extended the suspension of flights serving Chinese cities amid concerns over the spread of coronavirus. On Monday, the airline said flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai had been cancelled until 31 March. We are contacting customers on cancelled flights so we can discuss their travel options, including rebooking onto other carriers where possible, full refunds or booking with BA for a later date of travel. Safety is at the heart of everything we do and we will keep the situation under review. Virgin Atlantic extended the suspension of its flights to mainland China last week. The airline said flights on its Heathrow-Shanghai route would not be in operation until 28 March. In the same statement, PHE revealed that two of the four new cases of coronavirus are healthcare workers. Doyle added: \u201cTwo of these new cases are healthcare workers and as soon as they were identified, we advised them to self-isolate in order to keep patient contact to a minimum. \u201cWe are now working urgently to identify all patients and other healthcare workers who may have come into close contact, and at this stage we believe this to be a relatively small number.\u201d On Monday afternoon, the BBC reported that a GP practice in Brighton had been temporarily closed after a staff member tested positive for the virus. The government has declared coronavirus a serious and imminent threat to public health, while eight people have tested positive for it in the UK overall. Four of the confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK are all closely linked to one another, Public Health England has confirmed. It was revealed earlier on Monday that three men and one woman had been transferred from where they were diagnosed in Brighton to London over the weekend in order to receive specialist care. Yvonne Doyle, medical director for PHE, said: \u201cAs a result of our contact tracing we now know the new cases announced today are all closely linked to one another. \u201cOur priority has been to speak to those who have close and sustained contact with confirmed cases, so we can advise them on what they can do to limit the spread of the virus. The director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said recent cases of coronavirus reported in France and the UK could \u201cbe the spark that becomes a bigger fire\u201d. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\u2019 comments came after a British man, who caught the virus at a conference in Singapore, was linked with other cases in the European countries. Eight people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, while five British nationals tested positive in France following the Sussex businessman\u2019s trip to a French ski resort. Ghebreyesus told a press conference: \u201cIn recent days we have seen some concerning instances of onward transmission from people with no travel history to China, like the cases reported in France yesterday and the UK today. \u201cThe detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire. But for now, it\u2019s only a spark. Our objective remains containment. \u201cWe call on all countries to use the window of opportunity we have to prevent a bigger fire.\u201d More than 50 people in Scotland have been tested for coronavirus, latest figures have revealed. Although statistics published on Monday showed all 57 people had returned negative results, the country\u2019s chief medical officer Dr Catherine Calderwood warned there was a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d a patient would test positive for the virus in the future. In a statement on its website, the Scottish government said: \u201cThe Scottish Government\u2019s approach is guided by the Chief Medical Officer and we continue to monitor the situation closely and to work with the World Health Organisation and international community.\u201d Laboratories at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh have been set up to test patients in Scotland for the virus. The number of people they have tested has risen by 16 since Sunday. Across the UK, a total of 1,114 people have been tested for coronavirus. A school in Southampton has been closed after students were put in isolation over coronavirus fears. St Mary\u2019s Independent School in Bitterne Park is on lockdown, and pupils have been evacuated, according to the Bournemouth Echo. Some of the children at the school were reportedly struck down with symptoms similar to those of the virus, and put in isolation after being assessed by medical professionals at Southampton General Hospital. St Mary\u2019s, which is in contact with Public Health England, will remain closed for deep cleaning. The Echo reported a statement sent to parents from headteacher Claire Charlemagne said: \u201cI am sorry to inform you that a family with children at the prep and senior departments who have recently travelled to the region affected by coronavirus have developed symptoms similar to those presenting with the coronavirus, and having been checked by medical professionals at Southampton General Hospital have been placed in isolation.\u201d Hi, I\u2019m Amy Walker, taking over the live blog from my colleague Aamna Mohdin. The Chinese gadget manufacturer, TCL communication, has become the latest company to make cutbacks to its planned presence at the upcoming Mobile World Congress (MWC) amid the coronavirus crisis. The company has said it would still have a booth on the tech show\u2019s floor, but would no longer hold a press conference. Sony and Amazon are among the other phone makers to have withdrawn from the event \u2013 which will be held in Barcelona later this month \u2013 in recent days, citing concerns about the spread of the virus. Ericsson, LG and Nvidia have also pulled out of the show. In a statement, TCL said: \u201cGiven the recent global health concerns due to the spread of the 2019-nCoV virus, and out of an abundance of caution and care for our staff, customers, press and other guests, TCL Communication is cancelling its global press event for MWC 2020, which was planned for 22 February 2020. \u201cThis decision does not impact any other MWC 2020 activities planned by the company and TCL will still announce its latest mobile devices and showcase them at its booth in the Fira Gran Via - Hall 3, Stand 3D11 - from 24-27 February as scheduled.\u201d A UK law firm that specialises in private education has said independent schools should discourage students from flying to China and consider keeping their boarding house open and staffed during the half-term break. Vicky Wilson, Senior Associate in the Education practice at Wilsons, said: Pupils from China and Hong Kong make up the biggest single group of overseas student in the UK\u2019s independent schools. Coronavirus is something every school must address this week. The Foreign Office has advised people in the UK to avoid all but essential travel to China and independent schools must reinforce that to pupils and their families. Missing a family reunion is hard on everyone but it is preferable to pupils risking their education being seriously disrupted by Coronavirus and its fallout. Wilsons Solicitors have listed six things all independent schools should be doing ahead of the holiday. Talk to students and families about whether it\u2019s necessary to go back to China If Chinese pupils stay in the UK, ensure they have guardianship arrangements in place Consider keeping your boarding house open and staffed during the holiday Have a staff member at the school responsible for communicating with pupils and families If students do travel to China, ensure medical staff at the school are trained to spot Coronavirus symptoms Ensure children can still study if they have to enter quarantine The Royal Free Hospital, in north London, said two of the patients had been taken for treatment at its high consequence infectious disease treatment centre. A statement said: We are treating an additional two patients with Wuhan novel coronavirus at the Royal Free Hospital (RFH), which means there are a total of three patients with the condition at the RFH. The RFH is one of a small number of specialist centres in England for treating infectious diseases such as coronavirus. As the patients are being treated in isolation, there is no risk to any other patients or visitors. All of our services remain open as usual, so if you have a hospital appointment please attend as planned. Staff at a local community centre in Brighton have been advised to self-isolate after the man at the centre of the Brighton and Hove outbreak visited a class there last week, The Argus reports. A manager and some volunteers at the Cornerstone Community Centre in Hove have been advised by Public Health England to self-isolate after the man attended a yoga class. One concerned centre user told The Argus: The man visited the centre last week to go to a runners yoga class. People are very concerned about the lack of clear information from the NHS about this man\u2019s movements. The centre manager has been told to self-isolate. \u201cPeople are turning up at the centre and don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Eight people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK out of 1,114 tested as of 2pm Monday, Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said. At the Grenadier pub in Hove punters seemed unconcerned that a man who has been diagnosed with coronavirus was served here a few days ago. There were about a dozen customers watching football and enjoying a pint on Monday afternoon, and although all staff who were on duty at the time the man was hosted have been told to self-isolate, there were plenty of people behind the bar too. A Grenadier pub spokesperson said: \u201cWe are following the advice and working closely with Public Health England who have advised us that there is minimal ongoing risk of infection to either guests or staff, and as such the pub remains open for business as usual.\u201d The man, who was the third confirmed case of coronavirus in the UK, is believed to have visited the pub on the evening of 1 February. Breaking: a GP in Sussex has been temporarily shut down after a member of staff tested positive for the coronavirus, BBC reports An message left at the medical centre\u2019s phone says: \u201cUnfortunately, the building has had to close due to an urgent operational health and safety reason,\u201d Reuters reports. Here\u2019s a report by my colleague Haroon Siddique on the British national believed to have passed the bug to at least 11 Britons in three countries, prompting concerns about the danger posed by so-called super spreaders. The unnamed man, the first Briton to have tested positive for coronavirus, travelled to Singapore for a sales conference that exposed the Sussex businessman to the Wuhan coronavirus. After the conference, the Briton travelled to the French ski resort of Les Contamines-Montjoie near Mont Blanc, where he stayed with his family between 24 and 28 January. He then flew back to the UK on a busy easyJet flight from Geneva to Gatwick. Still oblivious to the fact he had the virus, which has a two-week incubation period, he returned home and on the evening of 1 February he visited a local pub, The Grenadier, in Hove. Just under a fifth of known cases of the new coronavirus in the worst-affected region in China may result in death, a report from Imperial College London estimates. Researchers from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis have found that the case fatality ratio (CFR) for people in Hubei province is 18% \u2013 this however may reflect the most severe cases that the overwhelmed health system is treating, with other less severe cases not being recorded. The researchers estimate the CFR is much lower in travellers outside China, between 1.2 and 5.6%, and the overall CFR in all infections, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, is approximately 1%. The researchers said: It is important to note that the differences in these estimates does not reflect underlying differences in disease severity between countries. CFRs seen in individual countries will vary depending on the sensitivity of different surveillance systems to detect cases of differing levels of severity and the clinical care offered to severely ill cases. All CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland China is unclear. The UK\u2019s decision to declare the coronavirus outbreak as a \u201cserious and imminent threat\u201d to public health gives the government fresh legal powers to forcibly quarantine people and send them into isolation if they pose a threat. The PA Media news agency reports that the decision was in response to one of the Britons who returned from Wuhan in China, the centre of the outbreak, attempting to leave isolation at Arrowe Park hospital on Merseyside. The news agency cited a government source that \u201cthere was someone who was threatening to abscond from Arrowe Park\u201d. All the Britons who returned on the evacuation flight signed a contract agreeing to a 14-day quarantine period, which ends this Thursday. There were concerns, however, that those contracts were not legally enforceable, leading to the new regulations. The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, has made his first public appearance in weeks. State broadcaster CCTV has posted a short segment of Xi visiting a neighbourhood in Beijing. Xi is shown wearing a surgical mask, having his temperature taken, and greeting residents. According to CCTV, Xi \u201cinvestigated and directed\u201d the ongoing virus prevention work and asked after residents and workers. Xi\u2019s disappearance over the last few weeks is unusual for a leader whose face is featured constantly on state newspapers and broadcast on the nightly news. While state media have frequently reported statements made by Xi, he had not been seen in public since a meeting with the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on 29 January and a meeting with the Cambodian prime minister, Hun Sen, in Beijing on 5 February. He has not been shown visiting doctors or hospitals or patients or visiting Wuhan. Instead, he sent his second-in-command, the premier, Li Keqiang. Observers say Xi may have been insulating himself from the public fallout from the crisis, making it easier to blame local officials. Others have pointed out that he is doing what several other Chinese leaders before have done during times of crisis of stepping back from the limelight while still maintaining firm control. Internet users have joked that he may have found a safe place to quarantine himself. Now that the central government has taken control of the handling of the outbreak, it may be harder to deflect blame. Moreover, the top leadership is also facing an outpouring of public anger over the recent death of a doctor who was punished for trying to warn colleagues and friends about the virus. Xi may not have the luxury of staying in the background. Public Health England is speaking to people who have had close and sustained contact with the new confirmed cases. Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of national infection service at Public Health England, said: These new cases are all closely linked and were rapidly identified through Public Health England\u2019s comprehensive contact tracing approach and tested quickly. Our priority is speaking to those people who have had close and sustained contact with confirmed cases so that we can advise them on what they can do to limit the spread of the virus. A growing number of countries across the world are evacuating or planning to evacuate their citizens from parts of China hit by coronavirus. Reuters has collated a list of the countries who have evacuated some of their citizens so far: Kazakhstan will send two planes to China on 10 and 11 February to evacuate its citizens. Kazakhstan has already evacuated 83 people from Wuhan. Of the 719 Kazakhs remaining in China, 391 have asked to be repatriated. Singapore: A second evacuation flight is bringing back another 174 Singaporeans and their family members from Wuhan to the city-state on 9 February, Singapore\u2019s foreign ministry said. Philippines: Thirty Filipinos returned to the Philippines on 9 February from Wuhan, the department of foreign affairs said. The returning passengers and a 10-member government team will be quarantined for 14 days. UK: Britain\u2019s final evacuation flight from Wuhan, carrying more than 200 people, landed at a Royal Air Force base in central England on 9 February. A plane carrying 83 British and 27 European Union nationals from Wuhan landed in Britain last week. Brazil: The 34 Brazilians evacuated from Wuhan landed in Brazil on 9 February, where they will begin 18 days of quarantine. US: Two planes with about 300 passengers, mostly US citizens, took off from Wuhan on 6 February bound for the US. It was the third group of evacuees from the heart of the coronavirus outbreak, the US state department said. Taiwan: About 500 Taiwanese stranded in Wuhan are the first batch to be evacuated Uzbekistan: 251 people from China and quarantined them on arrival in Tashkent, the Central Asian nation\u2019s state airline said on 6 February. Italy: The country flew back 56 nationals from Wuhan to Rome on 3 February. The group will spend two weeks in quarantine in a military hospital, the government said. Saudi Arabia: 10 students from Wuhan have been evacuated, Saudi state television reported on 2 February. A plane-load of New Zealanders, Australians and Pacific Islanders evacuated from Wuhan arrived in Auckland, New Zealand on 5 February, officials said. Thailand: A plane brought 138 Thai nationals home from Wuhan last week. They will spend two weeks in quarantine. France: Some nationals have been evacuated from Wuhan and would be placed in quarantine. It said it would first evacuate nationals without symptoms and then those showing symptoms at a later, unspecified date. Canada: The first group of 176 citizens were evacuated from Wuhan to an Ontario air force base early on 5 February, according to the Globe and Mail newspaper. All evacuees will be quarantined on the base for two weeks. Japan: The country has repatriated 565 nationals since the end of January. South Korea: About 368 people were flown home on a charter flight that arrived on 31 January. A second chartered flight departed Seoul for Wuhan on the same day, with plans to evacuate around 350 more South Korean citizens. Indonesia: The government flew 243 Indonesians from Hubei on 2 February and placed them under quarantine at a military base on an island north-west of Borneo. Reuters also has a list of countries preparing to evacuate their citizens. Netherlands: The country is preparing the voluntary evacuation of 20 Dutch nationals and their families from Hubei, Stef Blok, the Dutch foreign minister, said. The Netherlands is finalising arrangements with EU partners and Chinese authorities. Spain: The government is working with China and the European Union to repatriate its nationals. Dr Al Edwards, an associate professor at the University of Reading\u2019s school of pharmacy, said the government was right to declare the coronavirus as a serious and imminent threat to people in the UK. Edwards said: The main challenges facing Britain and the wider world are containment, finding everyone infected and stopping the spread, and the treatment of very ill patients, which could easily overwhelm hospitals in any country, however well-developed the health system. Finding people who have been infected is extremely challenging, but it is essential for containment. We are lucky we do have fairly rapid tests available, based on detecting the virus in patient blood samples, for example. However, these will only work when patient is quite sick. After people get better, or if they have mild infection, the virus can\u2019t be detected. The current rapid tests are based on detecting the nucleic acid of the virus by measuring RNA. This is the genetic \u2018code\u2019 of the virus. When the level of the virus drops in, a patient doesn\u2019t have very much viral RNA. This is good for the patient but makes the virus almost undetectable. One of the four new confirmed cases from Brighton \u2013 one of the three men \u2013 is a doctor who was part of the group that were skiing in the resort near Chamonix with the man who is at the centre of this outbreak, the Guardian understands. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, has confirmed the four new cases of coronavirus in England. The new cases have brought the total number of cases in the UK to eight. He said in a statement: Four further patients in England have tested positive for novel coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to eight. The new cases are all known contacts of a previously confirmed UK case, and the virus was passed on in France. Experts at Public Health England continue to work hard tracing patient contacts from the UK cases. They successfully identified these individuals and ensured the appropriate support was provided. The patients have been transferred to specialist NHS centres at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019s and the Royal Free hospitals, and we are now using robust infection control measures to prevent further spread of the virus. The NHS is extremely well prepared to manage these cases and treat them, and we are working quickly to identify any further contacts these patients have had. Japanese health officials had confirmed four Australian nationals among the new cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. These new cases included 45 Japanese nationals, 11 Americans, three from the Philippines and one each from Canada and Ukraine, Reuters reports. The figure on Monday took the number of infections on the ship, docked in Yokohama, to 130. EasyJet has confirmed that a passenger who recently travelled on one of its flights has since been diagnosed with the coronavirus. The airline said Public Health England is reaching out to all customers on the flight. A spokeswoman said: EasyJet has been notified by the public health authority that a customer who had recently travelled on one of its flights has since been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Public Health England is contacting all passengers who were seated in the vicinity of the customer on flight EZS8481 from Geneva to London Gatwick on 28 January to provide guidance in line with procedures. As the customer was not experiencing any symptoms, the risk to others onboard the flight is very low. We remain in contact with the public health authorities and are following their guidance. The health and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is the airline\u2019s highest priority. All of the crew who operated have been advised to monitor themselves for a 14-day period since the flight in line with Public Health England advice. Note this happened 12 days ago and none are displaying any symptoms.\u201d The number of confirmed cases of Coronavirus in the UK has doubled from four to eight after four more people in Brighton were diagnosed with the infection over the weekend. The new cases include three men and one woman. The four have been transferred from Brighton to London to receive specialist care. Crucially, one of the four had been at the same ski resort near Chamonix in France visited by the patient from Brighton who was moved from the city to the isolation unit at St Thomas\u2019s hospital in central London last Thursday after they were diagnosed with Coronavirus. The gender of the four new cases, and whether they are adults or children, is not known. St Thomas\u2019s is one of the NHS\u2019s network of specialist high consequence infectious diseases (HCID) treatment centres in England. One of the other four confirmed cases is being treated at the HCID unit at the Royal Free hospital in north London and the two Chinese nationals who tested positive for Coronavirus in York are being treated at the HCID centre in Newcastle. Businesses are gradually reopening in China following the lunar new year holiday, which was extended to discourage travel in an attempt to contain the virus, but they face heavy losses. I want to hear your news, experiences and questions about the Coronavirus outbreak. You can email me at aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com, or reach me through my Twitter profile, @aamnamohdin Here\u2019s a report by my colleague Frances Perraudin on what it means now the UK has declared the coronavirus outbreak a serious and imminent threat to public health. Under the measures announced on Monday, the Department of Health said people with coronavirus can now be forcibly quarantined and will not be free to leave, and can be forcibly sent into isolation if they pose a threat to public health. A spokesman said: \u201cOur infection control procedures are world leading and the NHS is well prepared to deal with novel coronavirus. \u201cWe are strengthening our regulations so we can keep individuals in supported isolation for their own safety and if public health professionals consider they may be at risk of spreading the virus to other members of the public. \u201cThis measure will rightly make it easier for health professionals to help keep people safe across the country.\u201d A team of experts headed by the World Health Organization (WHO) flew into Beijing on Monday to help assess the latest outbreak. While China has borne the brunt of the disease with the vast majority of confirmed cases and all but two of the deaths, the WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said there had been \u201csome concerning instances\u201d of transmission from people who had not been to China. \u201cThe detection of a small number of cases may indicate more widespread transmission in other countries; in short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he said on Twitter. He called on the global community to work together and share what they know in real-time with WHO. Military personnel set up a covered walkway this morning next to the Diamond Princess cruise ship. About 3,600 people are quarantined onboard due to fears of the new coronavirus at the Daikoku Pier cruise terminal in Yokohama port. Another 60 passengers on board the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship have tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of infections on the ship to 130. Morning, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over the blog from my colleague Alison Rourke. The UK health secretary declared on Monday that the new coronavirus was a serious and imminent threat to public health, a step that gives the government additional powers to fight the spread of the virus. The Department for Health and Social Care said: The secretary of state declares that the incidence or transmission of novel Coronavirus constitutes a serious and imminent threat to public health, and the measures outlined in these regulations are considered as an effective means of delaying or preventing further transmission of the virus. China\u2019s death toll has jumped to 908, with 40,000 confirmed infections. Another 60 passengers on the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of infections on the ship to 130. Tens of millions of Chinese have gone back to work today after the extended lunar new year break. The World Health Organization has sent a team of international experts to Beijing to help combat the epidemic. The WHO boss has warned that confirmed cases of coronavirus being transmitted by people who have never travelled to China could be the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d. A memorial has been held in New York for the whistleblower doctor, Li Wenliang, who died last week from coronavirus. China\u2019s food prices spiked by 20.6% in January. A citizen journalist in Wuhan, Chen Qiushi, who has been reporting on the coronavirus epidemic, has been missing since Thursday. There are plenty of figures published about coronavirus cases in China, but here\u2019s are some that I found very interesting \u2013 the daily confirmed cases of the virus outside Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. The graph below, published by the state media outlet the Global Times, shows a distinct fall in numbers of people being diagnosed with the virus outside Hubei. The figures they have used are taken from the Chinese national health commission. Chinese state media is reporting that the government pumped $129bn into the financial system today. It says the money has gone in via \u201creverse repos\u201d, which is a reverse repurchase agreement. This is the purchase of securities with the agreement to sell them at a higher price at a specific future date. A citizen journalist who had been reporting from the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak has gone missing, prompting claims that the Chinese authorities are silencing another whistleblower. Chen Qiushi, a human rights advocate, has been missing since Thursday \u2013 the same day Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist who was punished by authorities for trying to warn colleagues and friends about a new Sars-like virus, was first reported to have died from the coronavirus. You can see our full story here. Sixty more cases of coronavirus have been confirmed on the Diamond princess cruise ship, domestic broadcaster TBS TV said via Twitter. NHK Japan is also saying around 60 new cases have been identified, quoting the health ministry. That brings total cases on the ship docked in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, to 130, according to TBS. When the boat arrived off Japan, authorities initially tested nearly 300 people of the 3,711 on board for the virus, gradually evacuating dozens who tested positive to local medical facilities. In recent days, testing has expanded to those who had close contact with other infected passengers or crew, and several more cases were reported over the weekend. Those who remain on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins and allowed out only briefly onto open decks. They have been asked to wear masks and keep a distance from each other when outside, and given thermometers to regularly monitor their temperatures. The Mobile World Congress \u2013 the largest exhibition for the mobile phone industry \u2013 being held in Barcelona this month, has announced travellers from Hubei province will not be admitted. In addition, organisers announced that: All travellers from the Hubei province will not be permitted access to the event All travellers who have been in China will need to demonstrate proof they have been outside of China 14 days prior to the event (passport stamp, health certificate) Temperature screening will be implemented Attendees will need to self-certify they have not been in contact with anyone infected Amazon has announced it will not attend the conference, because of coronavirus-related concerns. Other companies believed to have pulled out include LG and Ericsson, according to Techcrunch. China\u2019s consumer prices rose at the highest rate in more than eight years, official data on Monday showed, with inflation more than expected on the back of lunar new year demand and a deadly virus outbreak. The consumer price index (CPI), a key gauge of retail inflation, came in at 5.4% last month on-year, up from 4.5% in December \u2013 with prices of pork and fresh vegetables pushing up costs. It\u2019s the highest CPI rise since October 2011. The report showed that food prices spiked 20.6%, including pork which rose 116% from a year ago, up from the 97% rise in December. The on-month rise for pork was 8.5%. \u201cPeople also tend to hoard food and other supplies in this kind of situation. The hoarding will most likely push up prices,\u201d said Lu Ting of Nomura in a research note last Thursday. The Economist\u2019s Simon Rabinovitch in Shanghai, has been posting some pictures about the empty streets on the day people were supposed to go back to work. The Journal of the American Medical Association has published a report on the clinical characteristics of 138 coronavirus patients in Wuhan. It details symptoms and clinical characteristics of the virus and gives an insight into infections. Of the 138 patients covered in the results, common symptoms included fever (99%), fatigue (70%), dry cough (60%). Less common symptoms were headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. Most patients received antiviral therapy and many also received antibacterial therapy. About a quarter of patients in the study were admitted to intensive care because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. The median time from the first symptom to shortness of breath (dyspnea) was five days, and eight days to acute respiratory symptoms. The median hospital stay was 10 days. The study also found that of the 138 patients, 57 were presumed to have been infected in hospital, including 17 patients (12.3%) who were already hospitalised for other reasons and 40 health care workers (29%). This may go some way to explaining the rapid building of coronavirus-specific hospitals in Wuhan. The report says \u201cto our knowledge, is the largest case series to date of hospitalised patients\u201d and was published on 3 February. For the medically minded, I have attached the report here. You can find our latest wrap on the coronavirus below, including the WHO\u2019s warning that confirmed cases of coronavirus being transmitted by people who have never travelled to China could be the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d. As people in Beijing return to work for the first time after lunar new year, state media is reporting a 50% drop in train passengers. \u201cThose not wearing a face mask will be advised to leave the station,\u201d CGTN says. Normal restrictions in Beijing to limit the number of private cars on the road have been lifted temporarily, to help people avoid public transport. The state run tabloid Global Times has published footage of Wuhan\u2019s twice-daily disinfections, that began on Sunday. The head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says \u201cwe may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg\u201d with regards to the spread of the coronavirus. He says the detection of a small number of cases (globally) may indicate more widespread transmission in countries outside China, adding that there have been \u201csome concerning instances\u201d of the virus\u2019s spread from people with no travel history to China. He has reiterated a point he made on Sunday \u2013 that \u201call countries must use the window of opportunity created by the containment strategy to prepare for the virus\u2019s possible arrival\u201d. Ghebreyesus has called on all countries to share what they know \u201cin real time with @WHO\u201d. Members of a WHO-led \u201cinternational expert mission\u201d flew to China on Monday to help coordinate a response to the virus outbreak. A little bit more on the Kia announcement. It blames a shortage of parts for the suspension of production at its factories at Gwangju and Sohari on MOnday and Tuesday. It said it would monitor the availability of auto parts in order to determine whether to resume production after that. Kia\u2019s Hwaseong factory halted output on Monday but is expected to resume production on Tuesday. The continued closure of Wuhan means many shops remain closed, making it harder for elderly people to shop, as this tweet from the New York Times Beijing reporter, Chris Buckley, points out. South Korean carmaker Kia is suspending production at three factories in the country, according to Reuters. It follows Hyundai\u2019s decision last week to suspend work at its giant plant at Ulsan, citing a shortage of parts from China. In other markets news, the Australian dollar has risen 0.38% on signs that businesses are starting to reopen in China. The Aussie, as the currency is known, is standing at US67.01c after dipping to US66.62. The currency is seen as a proxy for the Chinese economy because of Australia\u2019s close economic ties with China. Looking at those figures for deaths and infections in China that we reported, I wanted to quickly look at where the suspected infections were. Of the 4,008 new cases of suspected infections, 2,272 are in Hubei province. This is 56% of suspected cases. It compares with last week as per below: Sunday: 3,916 suspected new cases; 2,067 in or 53% Hubei Saturday: 4,214 suspected new cases; 2,073 or 49% in Hubei Friday: 4,833 suspected new cases; 2,622 or 54% in Hubei Thursday: 5,328 suspected new cases; 3,230 or 60% in Hubei Wednesday: 3,971 suspected new cases; 1957 or 49% in Hubei Tuesday: 5,072 suspected new cases; 3,182 or 63% in Hubei Monday: 5,173 suspected new cases; 3,260 or 70% in Hubei Sunday: 4,562 suspected new cases; 2,606 or 57% in Hubei Of the 97 new deaths, the overwhelming majority are in Hubei province (91), with 2 in Anhui province, 1 in Heilongjiang province, 1 in Jiangxi province, 1 in Hainan province, and 1 in Gansu province Six more people quarantined aboard a luxury cruise liner moored at the Japanese port of Yokohama tested positive for the coronavirus on Sunday, bringing the number of confirmed infections on the Diamond Princess to 70. The new infections were found among five crew members and one passenger - four Filipinos, one American and one Ukrainian aged from their 20s to 70s, Japan\u2019s health ministry said, adding that none was displaying serious symptoms. Japan health authorities have now tested 336 of the ship\u2019s 3,700 passengers and crew. Initially, 273 \u201cat risk\u201d people were tested, but all passengers and crew have since been given thermometers and told to take their temperatures every four hours. Those with temperatures of 37.5C have to inform medical workers onboard the ship, British passenger David Abel said in a Facebook post on Monday morning. The Diamond Princess has been quarantined in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, for a week after it emerged that an 80-year-old man who disembarked in Hong Kong late last month had tested positive. Japan\u2019s government has said that \u201cin principle\u201d the quarantine will end on 19 February. Kyodo news agency said the government was responding to requests to secure medicine for passengers with chronic health conditions. The overall number of infected people in Japan now stands at 96 - the highest number outside mainland China. They include 10 people who were evacuated from Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the outbreak is thought to have started. A Japanese man suspected of being infected with the coronavirus died in Wuhan at the weekend. If the virus is confirmed as the cause of death, the man, in his 60s, would be the first Japanese victim of the respiratory illness. Stock markets remain fairly calm about the outbreak despite mounting concerns about the impact on the global economy. The Japanese Nikkei index is down 0.4% so far today, Sydney is off 0.2% and the Kospi in Seoul has lost nearly 1%. The markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai are down 1% and 0.8% after 30 minutes of trading. in commodities, oil continues to slide on fears of oversupply. Brent crude was down 38 cents to $54.09 a barrel. Nickel, a key steel-making ingredient, has however risen 2% after steep falls last week. Tens of millions of people plan to go back to work on Monday as a prolonged Lunar New Year holiday comes to an end. Authorities had extended the end of the holiday, which sees tens of millions of people criss cross the country to go back to work from their hometowns, by 10 extra days because of the virus. Many cities have been turned into ghost towns over the last few weeks. But it is unclear how much life will go back to normal. Schools are still shut. China\u2019s state council has said that staff should come back in \u201cbatches\u201d rather than all at once. Many factories remain shut and many businesses have asked their staff to work from home. Foxconn, the company that makes the iPhone, says it is still in talks with the Chinese government over when it can reopen its factories in Shenzhen in the country\u2019s south and Kunshan west of Shanghai, Reuters reports. But it has been given approval to get workeers back into its facility at Zengzhou in the central province of Henan. Phillip Inman, economics editor of the Observer, has taken an in-depth look at the effect that coronavirus is having on the global economy. Among the gloomier possibilities is this: If the virus continues to spread and Chinese activity remains deeply disrupted for months, a contraction of the global economy is not impossible, particularly as central banks have little effective monetary ammunition for emergencies. Here\u2019s the full story: Reuters reports that China\u2019s agriculture ministry has said the highly pathogenic H5N6 strain of avian flu has been found in a poultry farm in southwestern Sichuan province. This is the first H5N6 avian flu detected from a poultry farm after four cases found in swans this year. The ministry said on Sunday night 1,840 birds had died in the farm of 2,497. The rest have been culled. A memorial for whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang has been held in New York. Li\u2019s death sparked an outpouring of anger inside China. Li was silenced by the government for trying to warn people over the threat of the new virus, and later died after contracting it. Some welcome news for the 3,700 people onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is quarantined in Yokohama harbour after several cases of coronavirus among passengers. Reuters has more details on the advance team of international experts led by the World Health Organization (WHO) that has left for Beijing to help investigate the epidemic. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who made a trip to Beijing for talks with President Xi Jinping and Chinese ministers in late January, returned with an agreement on sending an international mission. But it has taken nearly two weeks to get the government\u2019s green light on its composition. The only member of the team that has been made public is WHO veteran Dr Bruce Aylward, a Canadian epidemiologist and emergencies expert, was heading it. \u201cI\u2019ve just been at the airport seeing off members of an advance team for the @WHO-led \u00a32019nCoV international expert mission to \u00a3China, led by Dr Bruce Aylward, veteran of past public health emergencies,\u201d Tedros said in a tweet from Geneva. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. Here is where things stand: Total deaths in China: 908, up by 97. Total infections in China: 40,171, up by 3,062. The rise in confirmed cases reverses the significant reduction reported on Sunday. Then, there were 2,656 new cases, which was down by about 20% from the 3,399 reported in the previous 24-hour period. China returns to work today, after the end of the new year break, which was extended by 10 days to try to prevent the virus from spreading. An advance team of international experts led by the World Health Organization has left for Beijing to help investigate the epidemic. There have been reports of \u201cshocking\u201d levels of racism in Britain in the wake of the crisis. 3,600 people quarantined on a cruise ship in Hong Kong have been allowed to disembark after tests came back negative. French health officials have confirmed that new cases of coronavirus detected in the UK and Mallorca are linked to a cluster in a ski resort. A doctor who blew the whistle on the Sars epidemic in 2003 is under house arrest.",

      "bodyText": "Indigenous activists in Canada have vowed to continue their fight against a multibillion-dollar pipeline project across their traditional territory after three female leaders were arrested by police early on Monday. Freda Huson, Brenda Michell and Karla Tait were among seven people detained when Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers \u2013 backed by helicopters, heavy machinery and dogs \u2013 moved in on the remote camp in north-western British Columbia. Police also dismantled a gate erected by activists to prevent access to Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territories and stop construction of the proposed 670km (416-mile) Coastal GasLink pipeline (CGL). The raid on the Unist\u2019ot\u2019en camp came after activists in Vancouver and Ontario launched solidarity protests, blocking commuter rail lines and access to shipping ports in support of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en land defenders. In a statement, the activists said the raid was launched while they held a ceremony to honour missing and murdered Indigenous women. \u201cWe\u2026 know that violence on our lands and violence on our women are connected,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThese arrests don\u2019t intimidate us. Police enforcement doesn\u2019t intimidate us. Colonial courts don\u2019t intimidate us \u2026 We are still here. We will always be here. This is not over.\u201d Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en hereditary chiefs, who oversee 22,000 sq km of territory in British Columbia, have refused to allow the company Coastal GasLink access to their lands. The C$6.6bn (US$5bn) project has the support of 20 elected First Nations councils along the proposed route. Five of the six elected band councils in the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en nation also support the pipeline. But Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en chiefs say the authority of these groups only applies to reservations \u2013 not traditional territory. Last year, the British Columbia supreme court dealt a blow to the chiefs, granting an injunction in favour of Coastal GasLink, which it said has suffered irreparable harm as a result of sustained opposition to the project. The Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en maintain they never ceded land title to the province or federal government and thus maintain jurisdiction over the territory. Unist\u2019ot\u2019en, the largest of a series of checkpoints on a service road leading to the site of the proposed pipeline, was constructed in 2009 and is now the site of a permanent \u201creoccupation\u201d camp and indigenous healing centre. As police prepared to enforce the injunction, solidarity protests have broken out across Canada. In Vancouver, police arrested 38 protesters on Monday who were part of a group that has halted access to four shipping ports in recent days. Over the weekend, members of the Tyendinaga Mohawk territory in Ontario parked a dump truck with a snowplow blade near a rail line, halting the Toronto-Ottawa corridor, one of the busiest commuter rail lines in the country. Dozens of trips over the weekend were cancelled. \u201c[Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en] never had a treaty with Canada. Canada can\u2019t claim it\u2019s their land unless they have a purchase receipt with the crown,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cOur position is they are our brethren. We have a relationship with them, and we support them in protecting their territory.\u201d Via Rail, which operates the country\u2019s commuter rail line, said it would not resume service until the situation in resolved. \u201cWe are aware that this situation, which is unfortunately beyond our control, has an impact on our customers and we apologize for the inconvenience this situation is causing,\u201d the company in a statement on Sunday. Environmental groups, which have long opposed the liquid natural gas development projects in British Columbia, expressed support for the the protests. \u201cThe cross-Canada protests in solidarity with Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en have helped to keep national attention on the injustices happening on their territory,\u201d Greenpeace said in a statement on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of vital role that peaceful protest has played throughout history in bearing witness and pressuring politicians to do what is right, not what is convenient.\u201d",

Edie expected to be living with Kate herself (\u201cYou\u2019ve got three and a half bathrooms!\u201d), but is instead installed in a nearby luxury retirement village, lest she supervene her mother\u2019s efforts by murdering her.</p> <p>Kate is a doctor specialising in palliative care at the local hospice.

Oberon\u2019s story comes to the fore in later episodes, and the question of whether rebirth as a different gender makes for a good enough life adds another layer of complexity to the family and the story.

Edie is probably a natural termagant who would never have been the life and soul of the party, but her story invites us to think about how events cannot help but shape us. It emerges that Edie underwent a double mastectomy for breast cancer, nursed her husband through bladder cancer and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and, after his death, found his diaries full of detailed accounts of various infidelities. Edie has been depressed for decades and the intermingling of it as a cause and effect on the quality of life is another of the questions probed by this intimate, clever, painfully perceptive drama. \u201cI want to be dead because I can\u2019t stand being alive knowing that I wasted all of it,\u201d she says to Kate, who might have hoped she would be a redeeming quality in her mother\u2019s sorrow.

It\u2019s an iconic drive that no visitor to the country should pass up: one that takes in 1240km of the most spectacular scenery Chile has to offer.</p> <p>Chile has always been at the mercy of its geography: long, thin and with a coastline shattered by intricate archipelagos and fjords. But when construction of the Carretera Austral began in 1976, it opened up the country, connecting the most remote villages and farthest-flung beauty spots. While the road - also known as Ruta 7 - has been a boon for locals, it\u2019s also created the perfect trip for adventurous travellers. And an adventurous spirit is a must: this is wild country still, with parts of the road not yet paved, and few fellow travellers.</p> <p>The road runs from Puerto Montt at its northern tip (a four-hour flight from Santiago) to Villa O\u2019Higgins at its southern end, on the border with Argentina and deep in the heart of Patagonia. You could spend months driving its entire length - which also involves several ferry crossings - but these are its unmissable highlights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7fc22234b99f82d6eb17292c855e47a6755ffd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7fc22234b99f82d6eb17292c855e47a6755ffd9/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chaiten volcano, along Carretera Austral, south of Chile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chaiten volcano, along Carretera Austral, south of Chile</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: reisegraf/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Chaiten volcano, along Carretera Austral, south of Chile.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Look out over smoking volcanoes</h2> <p>Parque Nacional Pumal\u00edn is nothing short of a wonderland for those inclined to wilderness wandering.

      "bodyText": "Winding down the spine of Chile, beside rushing rivers and snow-peaked mountains, past glaciers and fjords and through the Patagonian steppe, is the Carretera Austral, or Austral Highway. It\u2019s an iconic drive that no visitor to the country should pass up: one that takes in 1240km of the most spectacular scenery Chile has to offer. Chile has always been at the mercy of its geography: long, thin and with a coastline shattered by intricate archipelagos and fjords. But when construction of the Carretera Austral began in 1976, it opened up the country, connecting the most remote villages and farthest-flung beauty spots. While the road - also known as Ruta 7 - has been a boon for locals, it\u2019s also created the perfect trip for adventurous travellers. And an adventurous spirit is a must: this is wild country still, with parts of the road not yet paved, and few fellow travellers. The road runs from Puerto Montt at its northern tip (a four-hour flight from Santiago) to Villa O\u2019Higgins at its southern end, on the border with Argentina and deep in the heart of Patagonia. You could spend months driving its entire length - which also involves several ferry crossings - but these are its unmissable highlights. Chaiten volcano, along Carretera Austral, south of Chile. Look out over smoking volcanoes Parque Nacional Pumal\u00edn is nothing short of a wonderland for those inclined to wilderness wandering. A highlight is the trail that leads to a viewpoint over Volc\u00e1n Chait\u00e9n, which erupted in 2008, destroying the forests and towns around it. Now recovered, the park is teeming with well maintained hiking trails that reward walkers with awe-inspiring glaciers and cascading waterfalls. Created by avid outdoorsman and founder of The North Face brand, Douglas Tompkins, then donated to the Chilean government, the park conserves a vital area of temperate rainforest rich in towering, moss-covered cypress trees.

In fact, the 30-year policy of deregulation, outside of London, has made the situation worse in most areas.\u201d</p> \n<p>Local authorities are able to subsidise non profit-making routes, but many have made deep cuts in the past decade as their budgets have been squeezed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"957c47e2315fa5b4673fade03b6b04cae6ad82aa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/957c47e2315fa5b4673fade03b6b04cae6ad82aa/0_118_1180_549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Curzon St, Birmingham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"465\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first phase of HS2 will include a new station at Curzon Street in Birmingham.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grimshaws</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: \u201cWe want everyone across this country to have the transport services they need to improve their lives and opportunities \u2013 to do that, we must invest in the here and now.\u201d</p> \n<p>With new Conservative MPs in former Labour seats hoping to show their constituents a tangible benefit to their vote, the announcement will be sold as an immediate measure to improve transport outside of London long before plans for HS2 \u2013 the first phase of which is scheduled to open in 2028 \u2013 come to fruition.</p> \n<p>Proposals for the Y-shaped HS2 scheme run from London to Birmingham, and on to Manchester and Leeds. They are intended to free up capacity on local lines, and form the spine of a rail network fit for the 21st century. But its expected cost has rocketed since it was first announced by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government in 2012-13.</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, was known to be sceptical about the merits of the costly scheme, as are a number of the new-intake Conservative MPs, who have lobbied instead for the money to be spent on local transport schemes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3289f51d-eba9-471e-8d3d-20b4b257b473\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Potential emissions</b></p>\n    <p>Construction:</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Huge quantities of steel and concrete including concrete slab-track</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Moving construction materials to site</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Tunnelling (more carbon-intensive than open-air construction)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Construction machines</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Removing soil by truck</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Manufacture of rolling stock</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Journey to work of HS2 employees</p>\n    <p>Operation:</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Power source not guaranteed to be renewable.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is poised to give the formal go-ahead to the HS2 project on Tuesday, with ministers promising an additional \u00a35bn on buses and cycle routes to head off critics who fear the troubled high-speed rail line will suck cash from other priorities. Before the expected announcement giving the green light to the vast infrastructure project, Johnson will claim that his government will offer bus passengers outside London a more frequent service and simpler fares, as part of his agenda to \u201clevel up\u201d the UK. Arguing that local transport could have a \u201ctruly transformative role to play in levelling up infrastructure across the country\u201d, Downing Street claimed the investment package in bus transport of \u00a35bn over five years would result in more frequent services, including on Sundays, a simpler fare structure, and new priority schemes to allow buses to skirt traffic jams. It said many more bus routes would become \u201cturn up and go\u201d services, like those in London. The PM\u2019s long-awaited announcement declaring his intention to press ahead with the controversial HS2 plans \u2013 now with an estimated price tag of more than \u00a3100bn \u2013 is expected to be balanced by a plan to change the governance of the project in a bid to ensure value for money. It was unclear whether the government is planning to legislate to allow local authorities greater control over bus services \u2013 with further details promised in a \u201cnational bus strategy\u201d later this year. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government deregulated bus services outside London in the mid-1980s, arguing that competition would lead to increased passenger numbers, by reducing fares and improving services. Instead, a report by the cross-party transport select committee found last year that \u201cbus use has declined year after year, and successive governments have made no concerted or coordinated effort to reverse or even to stem the decline. In fact, the 30-year policy of deregulation, outside of London, has made the situation worse in most areas.\u201d Local authorities are able to subsidise non profit-making routes, but many have made deep cuts in the past decade as their budgets have been squeezed. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: \u201cWe want everyone across this country to have the transport services they need to improve their lives and opportunities \u2013 to do that, we must invest in the here and now.\u201d With new Conservative MPs in former Labour seats hoping to show their constituents a tangible benefit to their vote, the announcement will be sold as an immediate measure to improve transport outside of London long before plans for HS2 \u2013 the first phase of which is scheduled to open in 2028 \u2013 come to fruition. Proposals for the Y-shaped HS2 scheme run from London to Birmingham, and on to Manchester and Leeds. They are intended to free up capacity on local lines, and form the spine of a rail network fit for the 21st century. But its expected cost has rocketed since it was first announced by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government in 2012-13. Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, was known to be sceptical about the merits of the costly scheme, as are a number of the new-intake Conservative MPs, who have lobbied instead for the money to be spent on local transport schemes. But northern council leaders and city mayors, including Birmingham\u2019s Andy Street, have lobbied hard for the plan: though Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Manchester, has argued that northern powerhouse rail, which would link northern cities, should be prioritised. The decision to press ahead had been widely expected since the chancellor Sajid Javid threw his weight behind HS2 last month, telling allies it was essential to the government\u2019s plan to \u201clevel up\u201d regions outside London. And Johnson appeared to let slip his intentions to a 10-year-old schoolboy who interviewed him last month, telling him, \u201cin a hole the size of HS2, the only thing to do is keep digging.\u201d Anticipating the decision, Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: \u201cHS2 has been appallingly mismanaged by the Conservative party, which has failed to deliver a single major infrastructure project on time or within budget. \u201cIf HS2 is going to get back on track, the project has to be integrated with Crossrail for the North, it needs to be managed as part of an advanced rail network, and it must eventually extend into Scotland so that we remove the need for domestic flights.\u201d Cabinet will meet on Tuesday morning to give its final approval for the plan, though Downing Street stressed that there was no necessity for formal sign off. As well as the boost to bus services, Johnson will also promise a relatively modest 250 miles of new segregated cycle routes, and \u201cdozens\u201d of \u201cmini-Holland\u201d schemes aimed at increasing cycling and walking, like those he championed in several London boroughs. The commitment of 250 miles nationally over five years compares with a blueprint for 1,800 miles being planned by Greater Manchester under its mayor, Andy Burnham. The \u201cmini Holland\u201d schemes involve changes such as closing residential roads to through-motor traffic but allowing free access for cycling, to boost bike use and walking. Both the cycling and bus schemes are the work of Andrew Gilligan, the former journalist now at No 10, who was Johnson\u2019s cycling tsar in London. There had been expectations that he was planning more ambitious cycling provisions. The \u00a31bn a year funding for the bus and cycling plan is expected to be funded predominantly from extra borrowing. Javid\u2019s budget next month will signal a significant loosening of the purse strings, as the treasury adopts new spending rules that will allow the chancellor to use increased government borrowing to pay for long-term projects.",

      "bodyText": "Chris Silverwood has conceded for the first time he may look at managing Jofra Archer differently in Test cricket. The England coach said he could use Archer in shorter spells than has been the case but, if the situation demanded, he would still ask the paceman to bowl 40 overs in an innings. \u201cThings like [bowling 40 overs] we have to look at,\u201d Silverwood said. \u201cBut sometimes, when needs must, you\u2019ve got to do it. We managed Mark Wood through both the Test matches he\u2019s played here and he\u2019s bowled in short sharp spells. Would we look to do that now with Jof? Yes, we probably would.\u201d Asked if there was any aspect of Archer\u2019s handling he would alter if he could go back to October \u2013 a stress fracture of the right elbow has ruled out Archer for at least three months \u2013 Silverwood said there was nothing he would change. \u201cNot really. It\u2019s just a case of: his injury occurred. The first scan didn\u2019t show us where it was. The second has. We can now put a plan in place and get him going for our summer.\u201d \u201cBeing a fast bowler is hard work. It is hard work. Ask Jimmy, ask Broad, ask any of them. Being a fast bowler is hard work. It\u2019s just how it is.\u201d Some outside the England camp have suggested the degree of hard work \u2013 Archer bowled more overs than any other England player in 2019 \u2013 was simply too much for someone in his first season of international cricket. Silverwood remains unconvinced. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know, will we? We can\u2019t turn the clock back, all we can do is look to the future and say, well, \u2018How are we going to do it from now on?\u2019\u201d Silverwood\u2019s plan involves the exciting prospect of a closely managed group of Test fast bowlers, with an Australia-style rotation policy to keep them fresh. \u201cMy dream, my ideal is to have three fast bowlers fit at any given point so we can rotate them, so they\u2019re not always playing, and at any given point I\u2019ve got one sat with his feet up full of energy waiting to go. So when he comes in he can go and hit the game hard, and just keep that going. That is the dream. We have to make it reality.\u201d As it stands, Archer, Wood and Olly Stone are already part of Silverwood\u2019s planning for the next Ashes series in Australia. \u201cI would love to have those for the Ashes because we all know we get judged on the Ashes, so how can we give ourselves the best chance of succeeding? If I have three of them fit there, whether it is those three or not, then it would be a great advantage for us. \u201cI am excited to see Jofra and Wood in the same team. As an ex-fast bowler that would be exciting. But you have to get the right conditions to do that.\u201d Silverwood was speaking before England\u2019s flight to East London for the start of the three-match T20 leg of their South Africa tour. It is a series England will be going all-out to win as part of their preparation for the T20 World Cup, a slight change of emphasis from the experimental lineups of the ODIs. Silverwood also spoke of his own commitment to carrying on the high-throttle style of England\u2019s white-ball cricket in the Morgan-Bayliss era. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep being aggressive. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to break records and this team can break records. We\u2019ve seen it time and time again. They play exciting cricket. I love watching it, they love playing it and it\u2019s been a successful formula for them. It would be daft to change it.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s opening T20 could have Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Wood returning to the team. England are also in the process of finalising their Test squad for the tour of Sri Lanka. Willey\u2019s World Cup tears David Willey admits watching his England team-mates win the World Cup last summer brought a tear to his eye after he was axed to make way for Archer. All-rounder Willey was named in the provisional squad only to be ditched on the eve of the competition, which ended with the newly-qualified Archer delivering the decisive super over as the hosts triumphed at Lord\u2019s. \u201cI wasn\u2019t under any illusions, obviously Archer was going to come in and someone was going to miss out,\u201d Willey said. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant cricketer. I remember shedding a tear during the final, I\u2019d been a part of that group of lads for four years so it was hard to watch. But I was absolutely delighted for the lads I\u2019d been with in that time and it was absolutely brilliant for English cricket. \u201cI messaged every single lad that was a part of that group in that final. I think most of them replied but there was a few lads that didn\u2019t respond.\u201d PA Media",

      "bodyText": "Manchester United\u2019s vice-chairman Ed Woodward has backed Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r to attract \u201chigh-quality acquisitions\u201d in the summer and transform the club\u2019s fortunes. Woodward, who has become a target of hatred from a section of disgruntled United supporters who regularly sing about his death, recently had his home attacked as tensions continued to rise. However, rather than turning to the now-available former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, Woodward says United have a \u201cclear plan\u201d, with Solskj\u00e6r staying at the wheel. United languish in eighth place in the Premier League, with fewer than half the points of table-topping Liverpool, and Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side face a battle even to qualify for the Champions League. The January acquisition of Bruno Fernandes for an initial \u00a346.5m outlay has provided a welcome injection of quality at Old Trafford but Woodward admits there is still much to do. \u201cThe signing of Bruno Fernandes and return of key players from injury will be a boost to Ole and the squad as we head into the second half of the season,\u201d Woodward said as part of introductory remarks read out at a recent fans\u2019 forum. \u201cWe remain in contention in the Europa League and the FA Cup, as well as for Champions League qualification, so there is still lots to play for. However, as a club and a board, we do recognise that we are not yet where we want to be. \u201cIt is the overwhelming priority of everyone at the club to get us back to regularly challenging for Premier League and Champions League titles.\u201d United have been linked with Pochettino since his departure from Spurs in November but Woodward says he wants big changes in the summer, with Solskj\u00e6r key to the recruitment drive. United have been linked with a big-money move for Jack Grealish while Paul Pogba is likely to be moved out of Old Trafford. \u201cThe recruitment department is working to a clear plan and philosophy, along with Ole and his coaching staff,\u201d added Woodward. \u201cOur focus is on bringing in a combination of experience and the best young players with potential to develop further, fusing graduates from our academy with high-quality acquisitions. \u201cOur recruitment process focuses on analysis and selection of players over the course of a season, with a view to the following summer transfer window. As part of the rebuild we see this coming summer as an important opportunity. \u201cThere has been no shortage of investment in players over the past few years, with over \u00a3200m spent since Ole became manager. Our aim is to ensure that we continue to achieve consistency in quality of recruitment. \u201cOff the pitch it is important to note that the commercial elements of the club are geared to ensuring we have a self-sustaining model which supports investment in the playing side.\u201d",

A little bit of a domino effect.\u201d There were a number of reasons behind the Matildas\u2019 disappointing World Cup campaign last July but arguably the most consequential was what happened when veteran centre-back Clare Polkinghorne pulled up with a hamstring strain after Australia\u2019s opening game against Italy. Following the loss of Laura Brock (n\u00e9e Alleway) on the eve of the tournament, the injury to Polkinghorne had, as Ante Milicic said, a domino effect on the rest of the squad. Vice-captain Steph Catley, widely regarded as one of the best attacking left-backs in the world, was shifted into central defence. Elise Kellond-Knight, Australia\u2019s best defensive midfielder, took Catley\u2019s original place at full-back while Emily van Egmond, Australia\u2019s most creative midfielder, was played in a much deeper No 6 role.

Appearing on Monday night\u2019s Q&amp;A panel, Jennifer Westacott told the audience \u201cwe have to do net zero by 2050\u201d. Asked if that meant Australia should follow other parliaments such as the United Kingdom and legislate for net zero she said, \u201cI think that would be a start.\u201d \u201cI reckon if we could get the two political parties to agree to that and legislate it, we would have made a massive advance in this country because we would know where we\u2019re going,\u201d Westacott said. \u201cFor business that does want to take action in this space, that would at least give us a kind of certainty about where are we heading.\u201d Monday\u2019s panel featured no politicians and was focused on how Australia should transition to a carbon neutral economy. Audience members who asked questions included coalminers from areas including Victoria\u2019s Latrobe Valley. Westacott\u2019s comments come as the independent MP Zali Steggall and crossbench MPs push for bipartisan support for a climate change framework bill aimed at helping the transition to a decarbonised economy. It includes a proposal for a net zero emissions target by 2050, a carbon emissions budget, and assessments every five years of national climate change risk. Steggall is calling for government MPs to be given a conscience vote on the bill, which would only succeed if this was granted. The bill will be introduced as a private member\u2019s bill next month. Westacott told Monday night\u2019s panel what Steggall had proposed was \u201csensible\u201d. \u201cMake no mistake \u2013 and she acknowledges this \u2013 the how really matters. We have to get the how right because we\u2019ve got to create those new jobs,\u201d she said. The BCA, which represents Australia\u2019s largest companies, is also saying Australia, if possible, should meet its 2030 emissions targets without relying on carryover credits from the Kyoto period. And it repeated its call for the reintroduction of a carbon price to \u201cdrive the transition and incentivise investment in low and no-emissions technology\u201d. It is included in a scoping paper seeking views from members, which include Australia\u2019s major banks and mining companies such as BHP and Rio Tinto, as the group reviews and updates its energy and climate policies. The scoping paper says delivering net zero emissions at the lowest economic and social cost will require emissions cuts across all parts of the economy, including not just electricity, but also industrial processes, mining, transport and agriculture. The statement that Australia should effectively stop releasing carbon pollution within three decades comes as debate over climate action is escalating inside the Morrison government. Moderate Liberals declared on Monday the government should not underwrite a new coal-fired power station, and the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, acknowledged that, by signing the Paris agreement, the Coalition had already agreed to a long-term goal of global net zero emissions. It followed the Coalition announcing a $4m feasibility study into a proposed coal-fired power plant at Collinsville, in north Queensland. Last year the business council joined other groups in representing industry, unions, farmers and investors under the Australian Climate Roundtable banner in calling for policies that could put it on a path to net zero emissions. The group has previously been accused of standing in the way of serious proposals to address climate change. In 2018, it described Labor\u2019s promised 2030 target of a 45% cut in emissions below 2005 levels as \u201ceconomy wrecking\u201d. The paper says the business council has supported strong action for \u201cover a decade\u201d. It says it supports the Paris agreement, a transition to net-zero emissions by 2050, a market-based carbon price and using technology to drive the change and create jobs and industries that \u201cmaintain Australia\u2019s competitiveness\u201d. On the government\u2019s plan to use credits from the Kyoto protocol to meet its target under the Paris agreement, the business council said: \u201cIf we can meet our emissions reduction targets without carryover credits then we should.\u201d On Monday night, Westacott said a net zero target had been the BCA\u2019s policy for \u201ca long time\u201d but repeatedly stressed that how Australia got there was what mattered. \u201cThe how really matters,\u201d she said. \u201cIt matters for regions and we have a responsibility to step out how that will actually occur. \u201cBecause just saying stuff and then not being able to show how we\u2019re going to do it over what period of time and what cost and what technology and policy settings, what incentives, that will be another set of empty words that Australians will become cynical about.\u201d",

Campaign staff spend a full year door-knocking, phone-banking and organizing in Iowa and New Hampshire before setting off on a mad dash through the parts of the country where 98% of Americans actually live. Staying competitive in this feat of endurance requires fueling your foot soldiers. So what are the campaigns feeding their staff and what, if anything, does it tell us about them? Campaigns are required to submit detailed records of their spending to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) each quarter, showing how much money they raised from donors \u2013 and what they spent it on. We used those filings to analyze the remaining candidates\u2019 expenditures on all things edible \u2013 from Starbucks coffee runs and airplane snacks to and steakhouse dinners and pizza pies. This analysis covers spending from each campaign\u2019s launch through 31 December 2019. A caveat: each campaign uses slightly different categorizations in its FEC filings. We excluded expenditures if they included event space rentals or appeared to refer to catering for fundraising events.

Under the theme of \u201ccrisis, chaos and survival\u201d, it opened last year with Exit, an action comedy from Korean director Lee Sang-geun.

Hyun Jin Cho, film curator at the Korean Cultural Centre UK, which is supported by the South Korean embassy, said: \u201cAs you can imagine, there is a big demand for his work, but we had been planning to [put on this festival] before now. It\u2019s a big moment and we would love to also use it to let people know more about his earlier works.\u201d Initiatives like the film festival might be at one end of the scale of the new South Korean \u201csoft power\u201d \u2013 the other encompassing K-pop bands such as BTS, television dramas popular in east Asia and football exports \u2013 but it\u2019s clear there is a demand in Britain for its high-concept films. Screenings planned for this month, including an event this weekend exploring 1980s Korean film collectives, had already sold out before Parasite\u2019s breakthrough. Hyun said: \u201cThe scale is different but there is definitely a growing appetite, even in films at the more experimental end of things. We find that our audiences are very informed and they predate what has been happening this week.\u201d Wider momentum had been building up in recent years around films such as 2016\u2019s The Handmaiden and 2003\u2019s neo-noir action thriller Oldboy, Hyun added. While the London Korean film festival finds room to showcase arthouse offerings, more mainstream and commercially orientated Korean films have been featured in the London East Asia film festival. Under the theme of \u201ccrisis, chaos and survival\u201d, it opened last year with Exit, an action comedy from Korean director Lee Sang-geun. It also included a spotlight on North Korean film, which may have to wait a little longer before its Oscars moment.",

They talked about her possibly having a role on the TV show America\u2019s Next Top Model, she said, before Weinstein took them up to his room.</p> <p>Young was shown photographs of the front door of Weinstein\u2019s suite as well as its interior and testified she was led, the producer in front, Salinas behind, to the bathroom. There, the witness said, she was trapped after Salinas closed the door. Weinstein proceeded to pull down her dress, grope her breast and ejaculate in front of her, she said.</p> <p>Salinas told the jury she did not recognise the photographs of Weinstein\u2019s suite and had not closed the door of the bathroom on him and Young.</p> <p>\u201cI would never close the door on anybody, ever,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The jury heard from a prosecutor, Meghan Hast, that in initial discussions with the New York district attorney Salinas admitted she couldn\u2019t remember what happened at the Montage.</p> <p>\u201cDo you remember telling us, \u2018It\u2019s possible that we went up to his room because Harvey Weinstein would always get people up to his room at the Montage\u2019?\u201d Hast said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember saying that,\u201d Salinas replied.</p> <p>\u201cDo you remember telling us, \u2018I don\u2019t remember being up in the bathroom but I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t true\u2019?\u201d Hast said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s true is I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d the witness said.</p> <p>Hast asked Salinas if she was unable to admit closing the door because to do so would be bad for her career in the entertainment industry. Salinas denied that.</p> <p>The prosecutor went on to ask Salinas directly whether, acting on Weinstein\u2019s behalf, she tried to prevent Young from speaking out: \u201cIsn\u2019t it true that you stayed in touch with Lauren Young to make sure she stayed quiet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Salinas fired back.</p> <p>Weinstein\u2019s lawyers also called a friend of the woman he is charged with raping, who the Guardian is not naming as she has not indicated publicly if she is happy to be identified.</p> <p>Talita Maia, a Brazilian actor, lived with the woman in LA and was on the March 2013 trip to New York during which the woman alleges Weinstein raped her at a hotel. Maia told jurors the woman spoke highly of Weinstein and once called him her \u201cspiritual soulmate\u201d.</p> <p>The accuser testified last week that she didn\u2019t tell anybody what happened but was \u201cpretty shut down\u201d at breakfast after the alleged rape.</p> <p>\u201cDid she seem like herself to you?\u201d Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Maia said.</p> <p>Maia said she was testifying in response to a subpoena, telling jurors: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here at all.\u201d She said the two women fell out in 2016 but added: \u201cI don\u2019t hate her or anything like that.\u201d</p> <p>Maia said she and the woman met Weinstein at a Hollywood party a few months before the alleged rape and she believed the woman and Weinstein had been in a relationship and had stayed friends.</p> <p>Maia said when she found out Weinstein was a producer she teased him, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s why everybody is being so nice to you.\u201d Maia said the woman she was summoned to testify about put her arm round Weinstein and said: \u201cNo. It\u2019s because he\u2019s so cute.\u201d</p> <p>Prosecutors rested their case last Thursday after jurors heard from women accusing Weinstein of sexual assault including the alleged rape victim and the actor Annabella Sciorra, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/23/sopranos-actor-annabella-sciorra-re-enacts-alleged-rape-weinstein-trial\">who said Weinstein raped her in her home</a> in the early 1990s.</p> <p>Weinstein\u2019s team began by calling Paul Feldsher, a close friend of Sciorra around that time. He testified that Sciorra told him she had done a \u201ccrazy thing with Harvey\u201d, which he understood to mean a sexual encounter, and gave no indication it was non-consensual.</p> <p>Feldsher appeared surprised when a prosecutor presented texts he had sent Weinstein since October 2017, in which he promised the former producer his loyalty and disparaged Sciorra and other accusers as a \u201cdog pile of actresses\u201d.</p> <p>On Monday, Weinstein\u2019s lawyers started by calling the longtime manager of an apartment building where Sciorra alleges he raped her. Nelson Lopez testified that he remembers Sciorra living there for about a year. She never complained about anyone being allowed up to her apartment without permission, he said.</p>",

Claudia Salinas, a Mexican model and dancer who has appeared in films produced by Weinstein\u2019s companies, flatly denied having closed the door of the bathroom in Weinstein's hotel room while he was in it with Lauren Young, one of six women in the trial to accuse him of sexually attacking them. \u201cIf I had done that I would have remembered that \u2013 I have never done that at any time,\u201d Salinas said. Asked by one of Weinstein\u2019s lawyers if she had ever seen the movie mogul running out of a bathroom \u201ccompletely naked\u201d, she replied: \u201cNo, never.\u201d The defendant smiled and shook his head. The trial is drawing to a close. The prosecution is expected to make closing arguments by the end of the week and then the jury will be sent out. Salinas\u2019s testimony was one of the most poignant moments so far. Last week, court 99 of the New York supreme court heard an heard an account from Young, 30, a model from Pennsylvania. She is one of three witnesses called by prosecutors to show a pattern of so-called \u201cprior bad acts\u201d committed by Weinstein over many years. More than 80 women have accused the film producer, 67, of sexual misconduct. Facing life in prison, he has denied all five counts against him \u2013 two of rape, one of forcible oral sex and two of predatory sexual assault. Young said she met Weinstein and Salinas, an acquaintance, in the Montage hotel on 19 February 2013. They talked about her possibly having a role on the TV show America\u2019s Next Top Model, she said, before Weinstein took them up to his room. Young was shown photographs of the front door of Weinstein\u2019s suite as well as its interior and testified she was led, the producer in front, Salinas behind, to the bathroom. There, the witness said, she was trapped after Salinas closed the door. Weinstein proceeded to pull down her dress, grope her breast and ejaculate in front of her, she said. Salinas told the jury she did not recognise the photographs of Weinstein\u2019s suite and had not closed the door of the bathroom on him and Young. \u201cI would never close the door on anybody, ever,\u201d she said. The jury heard from a prosecutor, Meghan Hast, that in initial discussions with the New York district attorney Salinas admitted she couldn\u2019t remember what happened at the Montage. \u201cDo you remember telling us, \u2018It\u2019s possible that we went up to his room because Harvey Weinstein would always get people up to his room at the Montage\u2019?\u201d Hast said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember saying that,\u201d Salinas replied. \u201cDo you remember telling us, \u2018I don\u2019t remember being up in the bathroom but I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t true\u2019?\u201d Hast said. \u201cWhat\u2019s true is I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d the witness said. Hast asked Salinas if she was unable to admit closing the door because to do so would be bad for her career in the entertainment industry. Salinas denied that. The prosecutor went on to ask Salinas directly whether, acting on Weinstein\u2019s behalf, she tried to prevent Young from speaking out: \u201cIsn\u2019t it true that you stayed in touch with Lauren Young to make sure she stayed quiet?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Salinas fired back. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers also called a friend of the woman he is charged with raping, who the Guardian is not naming as she has not indicated publicly if she is happy to be identified. Talita Maia, a Brazilian actor, lived with the woman in LA and was on the March 2013 trip to New York during which the woman alleges Weinstein raped her at a hotel. Maia told jurors the woman spoke highly of Weinstein and once called him her \u201cspiritual soulmate\u201d. The accuser testified last week that she didn\u2019t tell anybody what happened but was \u201cpretty shut down\u201d at breakfast after the alleged rape. \u201cDid she seem like herself to you?\u201d Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno asked. \u201cYes,\u201d Maia said. Maia said she was testifying in response to a subpoena, telling jurors: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here at all.\u201d She said the two women fell out in 2016 but added: \u201cI don\u2019t hate her or anything like that.\u201d Maia said she and the woman met Weinstein at a Hollywood party a few months before the alleged rape and she believed the woman and Weinstein had been in a relationship and had stayed friends. Maia said when she found out Weinstein was a producer she teased him, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s why everybody is being so nice to you.\u201d Maia said the woman she was summoned to testify about put her arm round Weinstein and said: \u201cNo. It\u2019s because he\u2019s so cute.\u201d Prosecutors rested their case last Thursday after jurors heard from women accusing Weinstein of sexual assault including the alleged rape victim and the actor Annabella Sciorra, who said Weinstein raped her in her home in the early 1990s. Weinstein\u2019s team began by calling Paul Feldsher, a close friend of Sciorra around that time. He testified that Sciorra told him she had done a \u201ccrazy thing with Harvey\u201d, which he understood to mean a sexual encounter, and gave no indication it was non-consensual. Feldsher appeared surprised when a prosecutor presented texts he had sent Weinstein since October 2017, in which he promised the former producer his loyalty and disparaged Sciorra and other accusers as a \u201cdog pile of actresses\u201d. On Monday, Weinstein\u2019s lawyers started by calling the longtime manager of an apartment building where Sciorra alleges he raped her. Nelson Lopez testified that he remembers Sciorra living there for about a year. She never complained about anyone being allowed up to her apartment without permission, he said.",

Top stories A Liberal National party donor received a $5.5m jobs and investment grant despite potentially being ineligible because it is a registered training organisation. In April 2018 Nolan Meats was approved to receive the grant under the $200m regional jobs and investment package\u2019s business stream, despite being listed as a registered training organisation, a disqualification under the program guidelines. According to a scathing auditor general report, released in November, the program received 12 applications that were ineligible for funding, including one that was successful. A day ahead of the New Hampshire primary, Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders remain on a collision course. The two candidates represent disparate wings of the Democratic party and are increasingly contesting frontrunner status in the contest for the nomination to face Donald Trump in November\u2019s presidential election. On Sunday, a Boston Globe/WBZ/Suffolk University poll found Sanders leading in New Hampshire with 26% support, followed by Buttigieg with 19% and the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar in third with 13%. It was the latest in a string of surveys showing Sanders or Buttigieg leading the rest of the field. Bright spots have meanwhile been few and far between for Joe Biden of late. After the catastrophic performance in Iowa, where he finished a distant fourth, Biden is polling fifth in New Hampshire, too, unthinkable for someone who spent most of 2019 in the lead. Former resources minister Matt Canavan delayed releasing documents about his interactions with coal lobbyists until he resigned his post, rendering a freedom of information request void. In November, the Australian Conservation Foundation sought access to all records of Canavan\u2019s interactions with New Hope Coal and its lobbyists in the weeks leading up to the announcement of a crackdown on the use of secondary boycotts by environmental activists. The minister identified six relevant documents but asked for more time to consult third parties. Last week, following Canavan\u2019s resignation as minister, ACF campaigner Christian Slattery was told the request was now void because Canavan no longer held the office and the documents had not been kept by his successor. Australia Drones are being used to save koalas injured in the bushfires. Victorian forest and wildlife officers, with the help of the Australian defence force, are using drone and infrared technology in a search and rescue operation for koalas affected by recent bushfires in Victoria. Heavy rain in parts of regional NSW may have relieved immediate water security issues in as many as 20 towns, said the state\u2019s public servant charged with keeping the taps running in drought-hit regions. Scott Morrison remains in the political doldrums, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The Prime minister\u2019s approval sits on 39%, and more than half the sample, 52%, disapprove of his performance. Celebrity chef George Calombaris has put much of his restaurant empire into voluntary administration. About 400 employees are set to lose their jobs.

Its leader, Mary Lou McDonald, urged Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il to start negotiations with the republican party as the scale of its breakthrough confirmed a realignment of Irish politics. Another 66 passengers onboard a luxury cruise liner quarantined in Japan have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the number of infected people on the ship to 136. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has made his first public appearance in weeks, as some people began to return to work following the extended lunar new year holiday. The Trump administration has submitted its 2021 budget proposal to Congress, a $4.8tn plan which has no chance of passing into law. Massive swarms of locusts sweeping across much of east Africa have reached Uganda and Tanzania, the United Nations has said, threatening millions more people with hunger in an already fragile region. The US military is preparing to report a more than 50% jump in the number of cases of traumatic brain injury stemming from Iran\u2019s missile attack on a base in Iraq last month.

And goodness, how the audience was on Parasite\u2019s side, with the cheers becoming so much more pronounced for it than any of its other fellow nominees that it felt almost awkward by the end.\u201d It\u2019s time for government spending, writes Greg Jericho, with household wallets closed tight even before the hit from bushfires and the coronavirus. \u201cPeople will likely remain hesitant about what the future holds. With the Reserve Bank continuing to predict that wages growth will remain low and that the economy is currently having a bit of a stumble, unless the government sees fit to come to the rescue and determine a strong boost in spending is required to get some life into the economy, that hesitancy is likely to continue for another year.\u201d Listen On Today in Focus: does the British Labour party have room for Blairism and Corbynism? Peter Mandelson and Steve Howell represent the two opposite poles of the Labour party: one was a key architect of Blairism, the other of Corbynism. But they started out as inseparable friends at the same school in north London. Now their focus is on what comes next for the party. Plus: Matthew Taylor on the growing prevalence of climate anxiety. Cook A simple batter can be tweaked for savoury or sweet applications, used pan-fried, deep fried or baked, writes Jackie Middleton. \u201cI like recipes that are predictable, solid and dependable, and this basic savoury batter is all three. I use the batter, spiced slightly, for these pan-fried sweetcorn and zucchini fritters. I\u2019ve also deep-fried this mixture and baked it in little muffin moulds to create canap\u00e9s too.\u201d Sport South African teams are eclipsing Australia\u2019s Super Rugby efforts, writes Bret Harris. Form so far this season indicates a competitive Springboks team could be assembled by just selecting players from domestic franchises. A former NFL player has won the Oscar for best animated short film eight years after predicting he would one day be nominated. Matthew A Cherry wrote and directed Hair Love and won the award along with producer Karen Rupert Toliver. Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age lead with the budget surplus, using the words \u201cwipeout\u201d and \u201cup in smoke\u201d respectively, to describe its fate. The Australian reports that a second person \u201chas been isolated in quarantine on Christmas Island pending the result of a coronavirus test.\u201d The Australian Financial Review takes a look at some of the Australian companies impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Coming up The high court will decide on whether the Australian government can deport two Aboriginal \u201caliens\u201d Daniel Love and Brendan Thoms.

      "body": "<p>In a climate of serious concern finally rising about football\u2019s drenching with gambling adverts, Everton showed a glimpse of a better future at their home match with Crystal Palace on Saturday. Rather than promoting to the watching world Everton\u2019s sponsor, the Kenyan betting giant SportPesa, the players wore a name across their shirts that looked very much more appropriate for the self-styled \u201cpeople\u2019s club\u201d: their own Everton in the Community programme.</p> <p>It was a one-off, Everton taking advantage of the single match a season when clubs generally can promote a good cause rather than their commercial sponsor, which, for 10 of the 20 Premier League clubs, is an online gambling company. Palace were wearing the name of theirs, ManBetX, reported to be a Filipino-owned sports betting and casino outfit, operated by a company registered in Malta.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jan/12/gamblification-football-betting-act\">\u2018Gamblification\u2019 of football must be dealt with properly in next betting Act | Greg Wood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sporting the name of their well\u2011regarded community programme looked right for Everton and a clear solution to two major challenges for the Premier League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/premier-league-netflix-tv-sports-rights\" title=\"\">highlighted by the new chief executive, Richard Masters</a>, in his first media interviews last week. First and most obviously, as the government begins its review into gambling regulation, which was unleashed so dramatically in 2005 after decades of behind\u2011frosted\u2011glass restrictions, it would be such a better look for clubs.</p> <p>Masters talked about resisting any moves to ban gambling sponsorships, saying football and betting have a long association \u2013 which felt like an unattractive, unconvincing line the league has decided to take.

      "bodyText": "In a climate of serious concern finally rising about football\u2019s drenching with gambling adverts, Everton showed a glimpse of a better future at their home match with Crystal Palace on Saturday. Rather than promoting to the watching world Everton\u2019s sponsor, the Kenyan betting giant SportPesa, the players wore a name across their shirts that looked very much more appropriate for the self-styled \u201cpeople\u2019s club\u201d: their own Everton in the Community programme. It was a one-off, Everton taking advantage of the single match a season when clubs generally can promote a good cause rather than their commercial sponsor, which, for 10 of the 20 Premier League clubs, is an online gambling company. Palace were wearing the name of theirs, ManBetX, reported to be a Filipino-owned sports betting and casino outfit, operated by a company registered in Malta. Sporting the name of their well\u2011regarded community programme looked right for Everton and a clear solution to two major challenges for the Premier League highlighted by the new chief executive, Richard Masters, in his first media interviews last week. First and most obviously, as the government begins its review into gambling regulation, which was unleashed so dramatically in 2005 after decades of behind\u2011frosted\u2011glass restrictions, it would be such a better look for clubs. Masters talked about resisting any moves to ban gambling sponsorships, saying football and betting have a long association \u2013 which felt like an unattractive, unconvincing line the league has decided to take. He acknowledged that \u201cgovernance\u201d should be stronger, \u201cparticularly to protect the vulnerable\u201d, but said that overall the Premier League is not \u201csniffy or judgmental\u201d about its embrace by gambling. It seemed an oddly casual approach. The alarm is being sounded more strongly than ever now about the transformation of sport\u2019s traditionally controlled association with gambling into relentless marketing online, on shirts, on hoardings, on television. The legal relaxations coincided with the revolution in mobile phone use, which has made gambling, mostly on apps, much more immediate and, some experts say, more addictive. Dr Darragh McGee of the University of Bath has warned of the \u201cgamblification\u201d of football after he studied the lives of young men who could no longer watch a game without betting on it and suffered dire consequences to their finances, mental health and relationships. One of the most heart-wrenching campaigns for stronger regulation is Gambling with Lives, set up by Charles and Liz Ritchie after their son Jack, a sociable, \u201cnormal\u201d young man and football lover, killed himself in 2017 aged 24, having become addicted to gambling. The other challenge for Masters, to which Everton\u2019s shirt on Saturday presented a clear solution, was his corporate mission to gain more recognition for the community work the clubs do. Before the long, blighted search for a chief executive to replace Richard Scudamore was called off with Masters\u2019 in-house elevation from caretaker to the job itself, a senior Premier League source told the Guardian that this was part of the brief. The clubs spend significant resources on their community programmes \u2013 the most recent figure provided was 3.6% of the last \u00a38.4bn three-year TV deals \u2013 and they want more recognition. The programmes have developed to work at the sharp end: with police, education authorities and social inclusion agencies to help disadvantaged people in tough neighbourhoods. The area around Goodison Park is one of the country\u2019s most deprived and the community programme works with residents, refugees and people who are homeless or suffering addiction problems. The club\u2019s chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, ran the community programme first and Everton are committed to continuing this work when they move to their planned new stadium on Bramley Moor Dock. Barrett\u2011Baxendale acknowledged at the club\u2019s AGM last month that \u201cin an ideal world\u201d they would prefer a \u201cdifferent type of sponsor\u201d than a gambling company. SportPesa grew and became vastly profitable in the relatively unregulated gambling environment of Kenya, where senior politicians soon became alarmed at the levels of addiction and indebtedness of young people drawn into online betting. Masters and the clubs are more likely to gain the wider appreciation they seek if their good works are not perceived to be jarring with commercial voraciousness, evidenced most clearly by selling their shirts to gambling companies. If the clubs turn such sponsorships down and promote their own programmes, their claim to have their communities at the heart of who they are will be more credible, and mean more, because they will have put their money on it.

      "body": "<p>Did anyone expect triumphant Tories to take a leaf out of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s defeated manifesto? But there it is, leaked to the Financial Times and the Sunday Telegraph. Plans are (just possibly) afoot to raise fat sums from the rich to spend in the new Tory seats of the north. Yes, even reviving Ed Miliband\u2019s \u00a32bn <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/02/08/tories-eye-mansion-tax-raid-pensions2/\" title=\"\">mansion tax</a>. Despite four abysmal election failures, might Labour yet claim significant ownership of radical new tax policies?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You have to pinch yourself to believe the newly radicalised Tories are about to clean up Britain\u2019s unjust tax system</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The 2019 Conservative manifesto was vague, but it pledged to limit \u201carbitrary tax advantages for the wealthiest in society\u201d. If so, a phenomenal bonus for the many can be seized from the tax reliefs of the few. Over the years, crafty wealth managers made bogus promises to successive chancellors that tax reliefs would lead to booming productive investment: no sign of that, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), which detects no gain from letting the wealthy pay less tax than their cleaners.</p> <p>Pensions tax relief is being eyed up. It costs the state <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/10/pensions-tax-relief-set-to-cost-government-almost-40bn\" title=\"\">almost \u00a340bn</a>, and 40% of it goes to the top 10% \u2013 those earning \u00a380,000 or more. The injustice is that an average earner (on \u00a327,000) gets only 20p tax relief on each pension pound saved, but those on over \u00a350,000 get 40p. Limiting everyone to 20% would save \u00a310bn. As things stand, to them that hath, the Treasury gives more in one relief after another.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation questions the whole panoply of <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/comment/how-wealth-taxes-can-raise-billions-more-without-scaring-any-horses/\" title=\"\">\u00a3155bn in tax reliefs</a>. The government has already taken aim at \u201centrepreneurs\u201d relief, which allows the wealthy who are selling their companies to pay just 10% instead of 20% in capital gains tax, costing taxpayers \u00a32.7bn a year, to no good effect.</p> <p>A reforming chancellor might question why, on someone\u2019s death, their capital gains tax debt dies with them. But the FT suggests they might try even greater boldness \u2013 tightening inheritance tax itself, the most hated of taxes (\u201cNo taxation without respiration,\u201d its opponents argue). Fabians and others long advocated replacing it with a lifetime gift tax to capture more unearned money passed to children, now avoided in trusts for the wealthiest.</p> <p>As risky as the annual mansion tax proposal is a plan to raise top council tax bands \u2013 properties have not been revalued since 1991 \u2013 to stop the poor paying too much while the rich pay so little. Dare they? And dare they help the climate by raising petrol duties, frozen for 10 years?</p> <p>You have to pinch yourself a good few times before believing the newly radicalised Tories are about to clean up Britain\u2019s grossly unjust tax system. No names are attached to any of this, so who is kite-flying? The Treasury itself, say those in the know. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, is reported to be wary, as well he might be, but this sends a message of Treasury orthodoxy to the reckless would-be spendthrifts in No 10: no spending without raising taxes to pay for it.</p> <p>Before the election, Boris Johnson strapped himself to an eye-watering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d3f2afa-1fe8-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b\" title=\"\">fiscal rule</a> to balance the budget within three years. This now regretted straitjacket was a political ploy to highlight Labour extravagance, but he\u2019s stuck with it. Paul Johnson, the IFS director, says there is no room for more spending \u2013 he\u2019s expecting bad news from the Office for Budget Responsibility ahead of the budget, similar to the Bank of England\u2019s dismal prediction of only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/30/interest-rates-left-at-075-amid-hopes-for-uk-economy\" title=\"\">1.1% growth</a> for the next three post-Brexit years. Javid\u2019s own forecast of 2.8% is a wild outlier. Here\u2019s the unpalatable budget choice: no new spending, raise taxes on the rich or break your own fiscal rule just after setting it.</p> <p>Look how wealth dashes to defend itself. Scrapping higher-rate pensions relief would be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tax/news/sajid-javids-half-baked-plans-mansion-tax-pensions-reform-come/\" title=\"\">fiscal hooliganism</a>\u201d screeches Hargreaves Lansdown, the wealth management company. The Daily Mail leader issues \u201ca word of caution\u201d. \u201cBy all means reward new Tory voters.

      "bodyText": "Did anyone expect triumphant Tories to take a leaf out of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s defeated manifesto? But there it is, leaked to the Financial Times and the Sunday Telegraph. Plans are (just possibly) afoot to raise fat sums from the rich to spend in the new Tory seats of the north. Yes, even reviving Ed Miliband\u2019s \u00a32bn mansion tax. Despite four abysmal election failures, might Labour yet claim significant ownership of radical new tax policies? The 2019 Conservative manifesto was vague, but it pledged to limit \u201carbitrary tax advantages for the wealthiest in society\u201d. If so, a phenomenal bonus for the many can be seized from the tax reliefs of the few. Over the years, crafty wealth managers made bogus promises to successive chancellors that tax reliefs would lead to booming productive investment: no sign of that, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), which detects no gain from letting the wealthy pay less tax than their cleaners. Pensions tax relief is being eyed up. It costs the state almost \u00a340bn, and 40% of it goes to the top 10% \u2013 those earning \u00a380,000 or more. The injustice is that an average earner (on \u00a327,000) gets only 20p tax relief on each pension pound saved, but those on over \u00a350,000 get 40p. Limiting everyone to 20% would save \u00a310bn. As things stand, to them that hath, the Treasury gives more in one relief after another. The Resolution Foundation questions the whole panoply of \u00a3155bn in tax reliefs. The government has already taken aim at \u201centrepreneurs\u201d relief, which allows the wealthy who are selling their companies to pay just 10% instead of 20% in capital gains tax, costing taxpayers \u00a32.7bn a year, to no good effect. A reforming chancellor might question why, on someone\u2019s death, their capital gains tax debt dies with them. But the FT suggests they might try even greater boldness \u2013 tightening inheritance tax itself, the most hated of taxes (\u201cNo taxation without respiration,\u201d its opponents argue). Fabians and others long advocated replacing it with a lifetime gift tax to capture more unearned money passed to children, now avoided in trusts for the wealthiest. As risky as the annual mansion tax proposal is a plan to raise top council tax bands \u2013 properties have not been revalued since 1991 \u2013 to stop the poor paying too much while the rich pay so little. Dare they? And dare they help the climate by raising petrol duties, frozen for 10 years? You have to pinch yourself a good few times before believing the newly radicalised Tories are about to clean up Britain\u2019s grossly unjust tax system. No names are attached to any of this, so who is kite-flying? The Treasury itself, say those in the know. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, is reported to be wary, as well he might be, but this sends a message of Treasury orthodoxy to the reckless would-be spendthrifts in No 10: no spending without raising taxes to pay for it. Before the election, Boris Johnson strapped himself to an eye-watering fiscal rule to balance the budget within three years. This now regretted straitjacket was a political ploy to highlight Labour extravagance, but he\u2019s stuck with it. Paul Johnson, the IFS director, says there is no room for more spending \u2013 he\u2019s expecting bad news from the Office for Budget Responsibility ahead of the budget, similar to the Bank of England\u2019s dismal prediction of only 1.1% growth for the next three post-Brexit years. Javid\u2019s own forecast of 2.8% is a wild outlier. Here\u2019s the unpalatable budget choice: no new spending, raise taxes on the rich or break your own fiscal rule just after setting it. Look how wealth dashes to defend itself. Scrapping higher-rate pensions relief would be \u201cfiscal hooliganism\u201d screeches Hargreaves Lansdown, the wealth management company. The Daily Mail leader issues \u201ca word of caution\u201d. \u201cBy all means reward new Tory voters. But don\u2019t alienate Middle England \u2026 If the electorate had wanted people taxed till the pips squeaked, they\u2019d have backed Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d To \u201cthreaten your core vote in the name of political posturing will only erode the goodwill so hard won in December.\u201d The Mail always calls the top 10% \u201cMiddle England\u201d, a trick to mislead aspiring members of the 90% into voting against their own interests. The Sunday Telegraph thunders: \u201cTax increases are profoundly un-Conservative.\u201d To touch inheritance tax would be \u201can assault on the family \u2026 once you\u2019ve earned something it\u2019s yours\u201d. The TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance \u2013 which always backs rich taxpayers against ordinary PAYE workers \u2013 says \u201craids on property and other assets\u201d are \u201ca misunderstanding of what the new Tory voters were looking for \u2026 Levelling up doesn\u2019t mean cutting other people down.\u201d This is just the first Tory fissure between the awkwardly separate interests of left-behind towns and wealthy southern shires. For a taste of what has happened to top wealth, Paul Johnson talks of this \u201csecond gilded age\u201d of a massive accumulation of great fortunes. The top 1% is still soaring away from the rest, IFS research shows. In this most unequal country (in the EU, only Lithuania is worse), the inequality within that top 1% dwarfs all the rest. That explains why they are so outraged at any attempt to rein in their wealth: they feel poor compared to those far above them, that fine distinction not between have-yachts and have-nots, but the gap with the have-yachts-with-crews. Entry to the top 1% starts at \u00a3120,000, but those on that income look up at the top 0.1% who earn \u00a3800,000 and well over.

Lloyd\u2019s is expected to confirm Gadhia\u2019s involvement on Tuesday as it unveils a culture advisory group that includes members from organisations such as Mental Health UK and the business ethics advisers GoodCorporation. The Guardian understands that the 14-strong team will be tasked with scrutinising changes at the insurance market as it tries to rebuild a tarnished reputation. The appointment is part of efforts to stamp out bad behaviour at the 334-year-old institution, which last year released a survey showing that nearly 500 of its underwriters and brokers either suffered or witnessed sexual harassment in the previous year. The survey was commissioned after Bloomberg reported evidence from 18 women alleging widespread sexual harassment, ranging from inappropriate remarks to physical assault.

Sir Martin Moore-Bick has told the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, that during forthcoming hearings examining the marketing of the combustible cladding and insulation that spread the fire, witnesses are \u201cvery likely\u201d to be asked to discuss issues involving potential fraud offences. The inquiry had already heard that witnesses could face criminal prosecution under the Health and Safety at Work Act and in some cases could be charged with manslaughter or corporate manslaughter. Moore-Bick revealed the possibility of fraud charges in an application to Cox for an undertaking that witnesses\u2019 oral evidence would not be used against them in criminal proceedings. \u201cAny questions put to employees of the manufacturers or sellers of the cladding materials about how they came to market potentially dangerous products are likely to lead to their invoking the privilege against self-incrimination,\u201d the retired appeal court judge said. The inquiry was halted on 30 January when lawyers for the architects, the main contractor, facade contractor and landlord led a request to invoke a longstanding protection against self-incrimination. The inquiry had already heard evidence that Arconic, the company that made the cladding panels, knew in 2015 that the material used on Grenfell was \u201cdangerous on facades\u201d. It also heard how in 2013, Celotex, which made the combustible insulation, was considering whether \u201cour product realistically shouldn\u2019t be used behind most cladding panels because in the event of a fire it would burn\u201d. The request for an undertaking that oral evidence at the public inquiry would not be used by police and prosecutors to try to send people to jail has upset many of the bereaved and survivors. They believe the companies and executives responsible for the disastrous refurbishment should give truthful evidence openly and without condition and face the consequences, even if it results in criminal prosecution. Others have remained neutral on the request, considering the undertaking the only way that witnesses will realistically give comprehensive evidence to the inquiry. Moore-Bick told Cox he did not believe the undertaking would impede any criminal prosecution. \u201cGiven the vast volume of documentary evidence and witness statements already available to the police, any admissions or inconsistent statements, although a potential bonus, are unlikely to provide the foundation for a decision to prosecute,\u201d he said. He also urged Cox to make a decision \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d, saying the evidence the inquiry team had uncovered \u201csuggests that significant risks to public health and safety will continue to be created until the full extent of what happened at Grenfell Tower is brought to light\u201d.

      "body": "<p>There has been no shortage of surprises in Ireland\u2019s election results. A party historically linked to the Provisional IRA won the popular vote. A political duopoly rooted in a civil war a century earlier has, finally, ended. And nobody knows what the next government will look like.</p> <p>Given all this real drama, it was more than a bit curious to see the reaction from sections of the British media. After more than three years covering Brexit as if it were a football match, more than a few British pundits seemed determined to shoehorn Ireland\u2019s shifting politics into a black/white view of the world with Britain at its centre. At times, it felt as if London journalists were commenting on a different election altogether.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Often the Irish election hot-takes were \u2013 well, decidedly lukewarm: Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s success was just like Brexit, or Trump</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some of the errors were factual. A Financial Times reporter wrongly declared on Twitter that the outgoing taoiseach Leo Varadkar had lost his seat \u2013 apparently not understanding that Ireland uses a different electoral system to the UK. (Varadkar had to sweat until the fifth round of counting.)

      "bodyText": "There has been no shortage of surprises in Ireland\u2019s election results. A party historically linked to the Provisional IRA won the popular vote. A political duopoly rooted in a civil war a century earlier has, finally, ended. And nobody knows what the next government will look like. Given all this real drama, it was more than a bit curious to see the reaction from sections of the British media. After more than three years covering Brexit as if it were a football match, more than a few British pundits seemed determined to shoehorn Ireland\u2019s shifting politics into a black/white view of the world with Britain at its centre. At times, it felt as if London journalists were commenting on a different election altogether. Some of the errors were factual. A Financial Times reporter wrongly declared on Twitter that the outgoing taoiseach Leo Varadkar had lost his seat \u2013 apparently not understanding that Ireland uses a different electoral system to the UK. (Varadkar had to sweat until the fifth round of counting.) Another newspaper\u2019s election \u201cexplainer\u201d got the number of seats in Ireland wrong. More often, however, the Irish election hot-takes were \u2013 well, decidedly lukewarm: Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s surprising success was just like Brexit, or Donald Trump.

      "body": "<p>Since the UK government first apologised for the Windrush scandal in April 2018, 8,000 people have been granted new documents that prove they live in the UK legally. Yet in the 10 months since it was set up, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/06/windrush-victims-still-waiting-for-payments\" title=\"\">only 36 people</a> have received any money from a scheme set up to compensate them for harm caused by their having been wrongly classified as illegal immigrants. The discrepancy is troubling. Delays can only serve to prolong the sense of injustice felt by Windrush\u2019s victims, many of whom are pensioners who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean as young children. Practical problems such as debt or housing issues should be resolved sooner rather than later, if they are to be freed to get on with the rest of their lives.</p> <p>Even after all that has happened, it appears that the Windrush generation is not a government priority. Already, some of those who expected to be compensated have died before receiving a penny. That doesn\u2019t mean there are no good reasons why just \u00a362,198 has so far been paid out, out of a total expected to be between \u00a3200m and \u00a3570m. Applications must be processed carefully, and not rushed. But with 1,100 claims so far submitted, and thousands more expected, ministers cannot simply stand by and wait for the system to right itself. Instead, they should be proactive in taking steps to improve it.</p> <p>The announcement of a two-year extension, giving people until 2023 to send in their claims, was a step in the right direction. But there has so far been no movement in response to calls from victims, MPs and campaigners to improve the provision of advice. The claim form has 18 pages, plus 44 of guidance. Filling it in is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/09/why-justice-remains-elusive-for-windrush-generation\" title=\"\">technically demanding</a>, particularly when it comes to assembling the evidence \u2013 doctors\u2019 notes, official letters, bills \u2013 that is expected to back it up. And there are psychological challenges, too, in a process that demands people comb through their past and quantify what they suffered as a result of the Home Office\u2019s mistakes. This ranged from the loss of jobs and homes, to difficulties with the NHS and relationship problems caused or exacerbated by separation, financial hardship and stress. In cases where a relative died after being deported or declared illegal, a traumatic loss may have to be revisited.</p> <p>Yet the government has not only <a href=\"https://www.ein.org.uk/news/law-society-says-windrush-crisis-shows-need-legal-aid-be-reintroduced-immigration-cases\" title=\"\">rejected calls to restore legal aid</a> in immigration cases, but also refused to provide a package of funding similar to that offered, via charities, to help vulnerable EU citizens apply for settled status after Brexit. As concerns mount about the small amount of compensation paid out so far, such obduracy appears increasingly wrongheaded.</p> <p>In the House of Commons on Monday the Home Office minister Kevin Foster accused David Lammy MP of having \u201clost the plot\u201d when he made a connection between a deportation flight to Jamaica that is expected to take place on Tuesday and the Windrush generation. But while it is essential to distinguish between people deported because they have been convicted of serious crimes and those targeted wrongly on grounds of their immigration status, Mr Lammy is right to be alarmed. The government has yet to publish its review into the lessons of Windrush, but the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51409739\" title=\"\">recommendation</a> that no one who has been in the UK since before the age of 13 should be deported was leaked, along with criticisms of officials\u2019 ignorance of history and recklessness.</p> <p>The Jamaican high commissioner, Seth George Ramocan, said last year that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/21/jamaican-high-commissioner-calls-for-halt-of-deportations-from-uk\" title=\"\">deportation flights should cease</a> until the report\u2019s findings have been digested. He was right. Policies surrounding the use of deportation demand further scrutiny.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Since the UK government first apologised for the Windrush scandal in April 2018, 8,000 people have been granted new documents that prove they live in the UK legally. Yet in the 10 months since it was set up, only 36 people have received any money from a scheme set up to compensate them for harm caused by their having been wrongly classified as illegal immigrants. The discrepancy is troubling. Delays can only serve to prolong the sense of injustice felt by Windrush\u2019s victims, many of whom are pensioners who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean as young children. Practical problems such as debt or housing issues should be resolved sooner rather than later, if they are to be freed to get on with the rest of their lives. Even after all that has happened, it appears that the Windrush generation is not a government priority. Already, some of those who expected to be compensated have died before receiving a penny. That doesn\u2019t mean there are no good reasons why just \u00a362,198 has so far been paid out, out of a total expected to be between \u00a3200m and \u00a3570m. Applications must be processed carefully, and not rushed. But with 1,100 claims so far submitted, and thousands more expected, ministers cannot simply stand by and wait for the system to right itself. Instead, they should be proactive in taking steps to improve it. The announcement of a two-year extension, giving people until 2023 to send in their claims, was a step in the right direction. But there has so far been no movement in response to calls from victims, MPs and campaigners to improve the provision of advice. The claim form has 18 pages, plus 44 of guidance. Filling it in is technically demanding, particularly when it comes to assembling the evidence \u2013 doctors\u2019 notes, official letters, bills \u2013 that is expected to back it up. And there are psychological challenges, too, in a process that demands people comb through their past and quantify what they suffered as a result of the Home Office\u2019s mistakes. This ranged from the loss of jobs and homes, to difficulties with the NHS and relationship problems caused or exacerbated by separation, financial hardship and stress. In cases where a relative died after being deported or declared illegal, a traumatic loss may have to be revisited. Yet the government has not only rejected calls to restore legal aid in immigration cases, but also refused to provide a package of funding similar to that offered, via charities, to help vulnerable EU citizens apply for settled status after Brexit. As concerns mount about the small amount of compensation paid out so far, such obduracy appears increasingly wrongheaded. In the House of Commons on Monday the Home Office minister Kevin Foster accused David Lammy MP of having \u201clost the plot\u201d when he made a connection between a deportation flight to Jamaica that is expected to take place on Tuesday and the Windrush generation. But while it is essential to distinguish between people deported because they have been convicted of serious crimes and those targeted wrongly on grounds of their immigration status, Mr Lammy is right to be alarmed. The government has yet to publish its review into the lessons of Windrush, but the recommendation that no one who has been in the UK since before the age of 13 should be deported was leaked, along with criticisms of officials\u2019 ignorance of history and recklessness. The Jamaican high commissioner, Seth George Ramocan, said last year that deportation flights should cease until the report\u2019s findings have been digested. He was right. Policies surrounding the use of deportation demand further scrutiny.",

Somebody who rolls a cool thick Seville against her cheek breathing in the smell of Spain in the dusk of Devon. Somebody who cuts thin peel skimming golden froth from amber soup in a January kitchen. When did this happen? Watching the teaspoon for the set, boiling the jars writing tidy labels. I should be wearing a white dress gazing up through blossom at a Spanish blue sky biting into olive flesh, and running my fingers along red walls warm with secrets instead of lining up nine jars of sun.

The origin of the term is unclear but some believe it was first used in 2019.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp; Thirty-three Labour leaders spoke to the Guardian and all but three supported Sir Keir Starmer or Lisa Nandy to become the party\u2019s next leader. All of the 33 local authority areas voted for Brexit in 2016.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022 Of those who would disclose their least favourite candidate, all but two said Rebecca Long-Bailey. The other votes were for Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022 Labour leaders in six of the 10 longest-held Labour seats that fell to the Tories said they were backing Starmer or Nandy. They are the Labour leaders in Rotherham, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Leigh, Bassetlaw, North East Lincolnshire and Bolsover. The other four leaders had not responded to requests for comment.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jenny Chapman, the former Darlington MP who chairs the Starmer campaign, said Labour members would have \u201ctheir heads in their hands\u201d over the row, and called on Jennie Formby, the party general secretary, to formally retract what she said were allegations of criminal acts.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey need to withdraw the allegation, because it is so serious and it\u2019s affecting those two individuals, who have been named publicly,\u201d Chapman told BBC Two\u2019s Daily Politics.</p> \n<p>The row began when Long-Bailey\u2019s campaign sent an email to thousands of supporters that included a link to a database of potential backers who could be contacted.</p> \n<p>This link appeared to access the Labour party phone bank of contacts, known as Dialogue, which would contravene leadership rules. Members of Starmer\u2019s team said they alerted the party to what appeared possibly to be an inadvertent data breach, which in turn triggered the investigation into their actions.</p> \n<p>It is understood that Labour officials do not believe there is evidence Long-Bailey\u2019s team breached any rules. Her spokesperson appeared to suggest neither campaign was at fault, saying: \u201cAs Rebecca\u2019s campaign has said previously, the accessibility of members\u2019 data stemmed from a failure to close Dialogue at the end of the general election campaign.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour MPs in the Starmer camp suspect officials at party HQ loyal to Jeremy Corbyn of being behind the allegations against him, as they try to ensure a leftwing successor to the departing leader. But Labour insists it had no choice but to report the alleged infractions.</p> \n<p>A Labour statement said: \u201cThe Labour party takes its legal responsibilities for data protection \u2013 and the security and integrity of its data and systems \u2013 extremely seriously. We have written to all leadership candidates to remind them of their obligations under the law and to seek assurances that membership data will not be misused.\u201d</p> \n<p>Long-Bailey has sought to distance herself from some aspects of the way the party has been run under Corbyn, blaming what she called \u201cmismanagement and a bad organisational culture\u201d for Labour\u2019s poor showing in December\u2019s general election.</p> \n<p>Later on Monday, MPs said they were frustrated that Formby had not attended a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP), or sent a deputy, to answer questions on the alleged data breach.</p> \n<p>They also had questions over the role of Labour\u2019s community organisers and a new rule imposed on MPs limiting them to 50 words in which to explain to local Labour members which leadership candidate they were backing.

      "bodyText": "Rebecca Long-Bailey has sought to draw a line under the row over leadership frontrunner Keir Starmer\u2019s alleged misuse of party data, insisting that it should not detract from the debate about Labour\u2019s future. Long-Bailey\u2019s team have angrily rejected any suggestion that they were behind the decision by Labour officials to refer Starmer to the information commissioner, which was then leaked to the media. A spokesperson for the Long-Bailey campaign said: \u201cThe investigation into Keir Starmer\u2019s campaign over an alleged data breach should not be allowed to distract from a moment of significant importance in determining the future direction of our party\u201d. Her communications director, Matt Zarb-Cousin, denied claims that he or Long-Bailey\u2019s campaign chief, Jon Lansman, had leaked the news, tweeting that they were running a \u201ctotally clean campaign\u201d. Labour officials told two members of Starmer\u2019s team last week that the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office had been alerted about claims that staffers had \u201cdata-scraped\u201d \u2013 effectively hacked \u2013 information from the party membership system. The Starmer campaign team, which has called the claims \u201cutter, utter nonsense\u201d, says the inquiry began only after it alerted Labour to a potential data breach included in an email sent by Long-Bailey\u2019s team to her supporters. Jenny Chapman, the former Darlington MP who chairs the Starmer campaign, said Labour members would have \u201ctheir heads in their hands\u201d over the row, and called on Jennie Formby, the party general secretary, to formally retract what she said were allegations of criminal acts. \u201cThey need to withdraw the allegation, because it is so serious and it\u2019s affecting those two individuals, who have been named publicly,\u201d Chapman told BBC Two\u2019s Daily Politics. The row began when Long-Bailey\u2019s campaign sent an email to thousands of supporters that included a link to a database of potential backers who could be contacted. This link appeared to access the Labour party phone bank of contacts, known as Dialogue, which would contravene leadership rules. Members of Starmer\u2019s team said they alerted the party to what appeared possibly to be an inadvertent data breach, which in turn triggered the investigation into their actions. It is understood that Labour officials do not believe there is evidence Long-Bailey\u2019s team breached any rules. Her spokesperson appeared to suggest neither campaign was at fault, saying: \u201cAs Rebecca\u2019s campaign has said previously, the accessibility of members\u2019 data stemmed from a failure to close Dialogue at the end of the general election campaign.\u201d Labour MPs in the Starmer camp suspect officials at party HQ loyal to Jeremy Corbyn of being behind the allegations against him, as they try to ensure a leftwing successor to the departing leader. But Labour insists it had no choice but to report the alleged infractions. A Labour statement said: \u201cThe Labour party takes its legal responsibilities for data protection \u2013 and the security and integrity of its data and systems \u2013 extremely seriously. We have written to all leadership candidates to remind them of their obligations under the law and to seek assurances that membership data will not be misused.\u201d Long-Bailey has sought to distance herself from some aspects of the way the party has been run under Corbyn, blaming what she called \u201cmismanagement and a bad organisational culture\u201d for Labour\u2019s poor showing in December\u2019s general election. Later on Monday, MPs said they were frustrated that Formby had not attended a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP), or sent a deputy, to answer questions on the alleged data breach. They also had questions over the role of Labour\u2019s community organisers and a new rule imposed on MPs limiting them to 50 words in which to explain to local Labour members which leadership candidate they were backing. A source said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got these incredibly important issues and we need to hear from Jennie or senior officers of the party.\u201d Members of Labour\u2019s procedure committee will discuss the alleged misuse of party data and its impact on the leadership election on Wednesday after prime minister\u2019s questions. Long-Bailey won the backing of the Aslef rail union on Monday, as did her choice of deputy, Angela Rayner \u2013 in preference to the more leftwing Richard Burgon. Mick Whelan, Aslef\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cWe believe that Rebecca and Angela have the vision, and the determination, to deliver for all the people of this country, and understand what Labour has to do to win back the hearts, minds, and votes of hardworking people in Britain.\u201d Long-Bailey, Starmer and Lisa Nandy have all received the backing of enough unions and other affiliated organisations to make it on to the final ballot paper \u2013 and also the support of enough local constituency labour parties (CLPs). But the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, having failed to win the support of one of the big five unions, is struggling to meet the threshold of 33 CLPs by the Friday deadline. The dispute over the campaigns\u2019 data use erupted as Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, took time away from the contest because of a family bereavement. His mother-in-law, who had been critically ill, died on Saturday.",

I\u2019ve been a Pompey fan for 60-plus years and have watched my club play in all the four leagues at least twice. I have no wish to watch my side get back to the Premier League ever again. The hype, the histrionics and the tailoring of \u201cthe product\u201d for TV (eg VAR and the game schedules dictated by TV) will drive fans away. Football is more than a \u201cproduct\u201d; it is part of society\u2019s glue, much like the BBC.

      "body": "<p>A man accused of aiding the Manchester suicide bomber in his deadly quest deceived his cousins into buying bomb-making ingredients on the same day his brother was visiting a convicted terrorist in prison, a court has heard.</p> <p>Hashem Abedi, is suspected of helping to mastermind the Manchester Arena bombing of 22 May 2017 with his brother, Salman, who died when his suicide vest exploded killing 22 other people. Abedi allegedly sourced the explosives, helped raised funds for the attack and arranged logistics.</p> <p>During the sixth day of the trial his relatives were the first to take to the stand. His uncle Adel Forjani told how the Abedi siblings had become increasingly radicalised in the months leading up to the Manchester bombing.</p> <p>During the hearing it emerged that on the same day, in January 2017, when Hashem Abedi allegedly duped Forjani\u2019s son, Alharth, into buying bomb-making components his brother, Salman, was visiting an Isis recruiter in prison.</p> <p>Adel Forjani, 49, told the Old Bailey that he saw both his nephews with the twice-convicted terrorist Abdal Raouf Abdallah in his barber shop, Fade Away in the Moss Side area of Manchester, on a number of occasions.</p> <p>Under questioning from prosecutor, Duncan Penny QC, Forjani said his nephews had begun showing signs of radicalisation, changing their dress and attending a different mosque, before coming into his shop with Abdallah \u201conce, maybe twice\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking via an interpreter, a concerned Forjani, said he told his sons that he did not want Abdallah in the shop and told them not to \u201cmingle with him\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI saw him [Abdallah] quite a few times, he was with different people \u2026 yeah, I saw him once maybe or twice with my nephews in the shop, yes,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Abdallah, 26, who was left paralysed after being shot while fighting against the Gaddafi regime in the 2011 uprising in Libya, was jailed for more than five years for trying to help people travel to Syria to join jihadists.</p> <p>The jury was told the Abedis were both seen with Abdallah, a local resident and regular visitor to the barber shop. However, later under questioning from defence barrister Stephen Kamlish, Forjani said Abdallah was friendlier with Salman and he was unsure how many times he had seen him with his nephews.</p> <p>Forjani said his nephews\u2019 behaviour began to change shortly after they started to attend a new mosque in Whalley Range. The brothers\u2019 behaviour was of such concern to the local community that their parents took them back to Libya in April 2017 \u2013 a month before the attack.</p> <p>\u201cIt was strange things \u2013 both of them began wearing more traditional clothing \u2026 someone must have told them [Abedi\u2019s parents] that they were being radicalised,\u201d said Forjani, who came to the UK as a refugee in 1994 with his wife, Leila Tabbal, the maternal aunt of the Abedi brothers.</p> <p>Following the bombing the couple\u2019s home in Fallowfield and barber shop were raided and both their sons, who are of similar ages to the Abedi brothers, were arrested but later released without charge.</p> <p>His son Alharth, now 21, told how he bought chemicals commonly used in explosives for Abedi, on 18 January 2017.</p> <p>Abedi said he needed to buy acid for a car battery and used Forjani\u2019s Amazon account to buy one litre of sulphuric acid. Forjani said he did not suspect anything untoward and handed Abedi his iPhone to make the purchase.</p> <p>However, after making the purchase he made a number of searches for sulphuric acid on his phone.</p> <p>Asked by Penny to explain these searches, he replied: \u201cI had a bad feeling. I just thought it might be to make explosives \u2026 I think that he believes in terrorism, that\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p> <p>That same day at just before 6pm Salman along with two other men, travelled from his home in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to visit the now imprisoned Abdallah, at HMP Altcourse in Liverpool.</p> <p>During the hearing the prosecution also alleged that the brothers\u2019 family were claiming thousands of pounds a month in benefits, with some of it being used in the bomb plot.</p> <p>Mother of six Samia Abedi continued to receive more than \u00a32,000 each month in welfare payments, even after leaving the country for Libya.</p> <p>In the months following her departure in October 2016, benefits continued to be paid and in the run-up to the attack her bank account was accessed to buy a large industrial-sized battery and other bomb-making equipment from B&amp;Q, the court was told.</p> <p>The jury was shown Samia Abedi\u2019s bank statements detailing monthly income payments of more than \u00a32,000 in housing benefit, working and child tax credit and child benefit.</p> <p>However, Samia Abedi, in her 50s, appeared to have left the country in October 2016, taking her three youngest children, Jomana, Wesel and Othman, with her, the court heard.</p> <p>A bank card connected to her account was used in the UK to withdraw thousands of pounds in cash and to buy a 200-amp battery from Shield Batteries in Salford and payment to B&amp;Q for tools, allegedly to construct the improvised explosive device.</p> <p>Abedi denies the murder of 22 people aged between eight and 51, as well as attempted murder and conspiring with his brother to cause explosions.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",

During the hearing it emerged that on the same day, in January 2017, when Hashem Abedi allegedly duped Forjani\u2019s son, Alharth, into buying bomb-making components his brother, Salman, was visiting an Isis recruiter in prison. Adel Forjani, 49, told the Old Bailey that he saw both his nephews with the twice-convicted terrorist Abdal Raouf Abdallah in his barber shop, Fade Away in the Moss Side area of Manchester, on a number of occasions. Under questioning from prosecutor, Duncan Penny QC, Forjani said his nephews had begun showing signs of radicalisation, changing their dress and attending a different mosque, before coming into his shop with Abdallah \u201conce, maybe twice\u201d. Speaking via an interpreter, a concerned Forjani, said he told his sons that he did not want Abdallah in the shop and told them not to \u201cmingle with him\u201d. \u201cI saw him [Abdallah] quite a few times, he was with different people \u2026 yeah, I saw him once maybe or twice with my nephews in the shop, yes,\u201d he added. Abdallah, 26, who was left paralysed after being shot while fighting against the Gaddafi regime in the 2011 uprising in Libya, was jailed for more than five years for trying to help people travel to Syria to join jihadists. The jury was told the Abedis were both seen with Abdallah, a local resident and regular visitor to the barber shop. However, later under questioning from defence barrister Stephen Kamlish, Forjani said Abdallah was friendlier with Salman and he was unsure how many times he had seen him with his nephews. Forjani said his nephews\u2019 behaviour began to change shortly after they started to attend a new mosque in Whalley Range. The brothers\u2019 behaviour was of such concern to the local community that their parents took them back to Libya in April 2017 \u2013 a month before the attack. \u201cIt was strange things \u2013 both of them began wearing more traditional clothing \u2026 someone must have told them [Abedi\u2019s parents] that they were being radicalised,\u201d said Forjani, who came to the UK as a refugee in 1994 with his wife, Leila Tabbal, the maternal aunt of the Abedi brothers. Following the bombing the couple\u2019s home in Fallowfield and barber shop were raided and both their sons, who are of similar ages to the Abedi brothers, were arrested but later released without charge. His son Alharth, now 21, told how he bought chemicals commonly used in explosives for Abedi, on 18 January 2017. Abedi said he needed to buy acid for a car battery and used Forjani\u2019s Amazon account to buy one litre of sulphuric acid. Forjani said he did not suspect anything untoward and handed Abedi his iPhone to make the purchase. However, after making the purchase he made a number of searches for sulphuric acid on his phone. Asked by Penny to explain these searches, he replied: \u201cI had a bad feeling. I just thought it might be to make explosives \u2026 I think that he believes in terrorism, that\u2019s what I thought.\u201d That same day at just before 6pm Salman along with two other men, travelled from his home in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to visit the now imprisoned Abdallah, at HMP Altcourse in Liverpool. During the hearing the prosecution also alleged that the brothers\u2019 family were claiming thousands of pounds a month in benefits, with some of it being used in the bomb plot. Mother of six Samia Abedi continued to receive more than \u00a32,000 each month in welfare payments, even after leaving the country for Libya. In the months following her departure in October 2016, benefits continued to be paid and in the run-up to the attack her bank account was accessed to buy a large industrial-sized battery and other bomb-making equipment from B&amp;Q, the court was told. The jury was shown Samia Abedi\u2019s bank statements detailing monthly income payments of more than \u00a32,000 in housing benefit, working and child tax credit and child benefit. However, Samia Abedi, in her 50s, appeared to have left the country in October 2016, taking her three youngest children, Jomana, Wesel and Othman, with her, the court heard. A bank card connected to her account was used in the UK to withdraw thousands of pounds in cash and to buy a 200-amp battery from Shield Batteries in Salford and payment to B&amp;Q for tools, allegedly to construct the improvised explosive device. Abedi denies the murder of 22 people aged between eight and 51, as well as attempted murder and conspiring with his brother to cause explosions. The trial continues.",

I have in the past stated in print that if I had a hammer I would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/oct/10/grayson-perry-pot-design-quote\">smash Grayson Perry\u2019s pots</a>. Did I mean it? No, I don\u2019t think so. But I felt at the time that criticism should be capable of emotional extremes. It should be a matter of love and hate. If some art is not worth destroying, how can any art be truly treasured? Criticism means caring so much about art that you can also detest it. I learned this from the Victorian art critic John Ruskin. In his book Modern Painters, he argues that a wealthy man could do a service to art by collecting all the minor Dutch painters of the 17th century, putting them in a gallery \u2013 and burning it to the ground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"de00ff04b859b407e71eb46db3c320c309f87f06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de00ff04b859b407e71eb46db3c320c309f87f06/0_0_2200_3297/667.jpg\" alt=\"Gabriel Rico\u2019s piece on display before it was smashed.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gabriel Rico\u2019s piece on display before it was smashed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter/@paveleguez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ruskin was the greatest art critic there has ever been and his readiness to use such violent imagery shouldn\u2019t be dismissed as facetious or inappropriate. He was making an important point. If art matters, if it has any true value, then it is also worth destroying bad art. Or being prepared to imagine that desperate measure.</p> <p>Except that no one has the right to make the call. I may be wrong about Perry and his many fans could be right \u2013 just possibly. Ruskin did in fact destroy art. As JMW Turner\u2019s executor he burned some of his hero\u2019s erotic drawings. Nowadays we mourn their loss \u2013 though it\u2019s thought he destroyed far fewer than he claimed.</p> <p>Is L\u00e9sper a critical hero or just a critical klutz? I don\u2019t respect what she has done as criticism. Where is the eloquence? She placed her empty soda can beside an assemblage of readymades to take a sarcastic photograph. Her point apparently being that if the stones, footballs and other objects in Rico\u2019s piece are \u201cart\u201d, so is her can. That\u2019s not an argument. It\u2019s inane philistine prejudice.</p> <p>Anger should be kept on the page. Criticism is a rhetorical art. Artists and the art world love it because it puts art into words, and into debate. In this flow of language, violent impulses have their place. But in reality, the destruction of art is abhorrent. Ruskin was a critic when he wrote about destroying art, a vandal when he really did so. I hope no one will ban me from private views after reading this because in reality I would never damage art \u2013 and I hope I would even take risks to protect it. Caring about art means getting emotional. But there is no critical value to L\u00e9sper\u2019s flippant populist joke or its shattering result.</p>",

I have in the past stated in print that if I had a hammer I would smash Grayson Perry\u2019s pots. Did I mean it? No, I don\u2019t think so. But I felt at the time that criticism should be capable of emotional extremes. It should be a matter of love and hate. If some art is not worth destroying, how can any art be truly treasured? Criticism means caring so much about art that you can also detest it. I learned this from the Victorian art critic John Ruskin. In his book Modern Painters, he argues that a wealthy man could do a service to art by collecting all the minor Dutch painters of the 17th century, putting them in a gallery \u2013 and burning it to the ground. Ruskin was the greatest art critic there has ever been and his readiness to use such violent imagery shouldn\u2019t be dismissed as facetious or inappropriate. He was making an important point. If art matters, if it has any true value, then it is also worth destroying bad art. Or being prepared to imagine that desperate measure. Except that no one has the right to make the call. I may be wrong about Perry and his many fans could be right \u2013 just possibly. Ruskin did in fact destroy art. As JMW Turner\u2019s executor he burned some of his hero\u2019s erotic drawings. Nowadays we mourn their loss \u2013 though it\u2019s thought he destroyed far fewer than he claimed. Is L\u00e9sper a critical hero or just a critical klutz? I don\u2019t respect what she has done as criticism. Where is the eloquence? She placed her empty soda can beside an assemblage of readymades to take a sarcastic photograph. Her point apparently being that if the stones, footballs and other objects in Rico\u2019s piece are \u201cart\u201d, so is her can. That\u2019s not an argument. It\u2019s inane philistine prejudice. Anger should be kept on the page. Criticism is a rhetorical art. Artists and the art world love it because it puts art into words, and into debate. In this flow of language, violent impulses have their place. But in reality, the destruction of art is abhorrent. Ruskin was a critic when he wrote about destroying art, a vandal when he really did so. I hope no one will ban me from private views after reading this because in reality I would never damage art \u2013 and I hope I would even take risks to protect it. Caring about art means getting emotional. But there is no critical value to L\u00e9sper\u2019s flippant populist joke or its shattering result.",

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill.

      "bodyText": "Brighton residents spoke out on Monday as the number of people in the city diagnosed with coronavirus rose to five. Outside County Oak medical centre, which was closed after a member of staff contracted the virus, a number of local residents spoke of their concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s scary when you look in the windows and see the people in the hazmat suits,\u201d said 23-year-old Ben Swan, a local dog walker. \u201cYou hear about it on the news and it sounds like it\u2019s in China, like it\u2019s really far away, but it gets quite scary when it\u2019s round the corner on your doorstep.\u201d He said he and his partner luckily had not visited the practice in a few months, but that the risk of catching coronavirus ran through his mind when he was travelling around the area. Melanie Roberts, 48, saw the centre was closed from her house just across the road. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying that it\u2019s so close. My family are fairly young and healthy so hopefully we\u2019ll be OK but it\u2019s worrying for older people, especially if it\u2019s been in a medical centre where people have been in and out who aren\u2019t well \u2013 that\u2019s a bit of a problem isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Roberts, a dressmaker with two young children. \u201cI think people will take more precautions now ... I think it will have an effect on people now in social situations, in pubs and shops and things. Maybe not a week or two ago, but now I think it will affect people quite quickly.\u201d The third case of coronavirus in the UK was diagnosed in Brighton last Thursday, and the man has since been transferred to St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London for treatment. Over the weekend the number of UK cases doubled as four more people were diagnosed in Brighton \u2013 three men and one woman, all of whom had been in contact with the previously confirmed Brighton case. However in many parts of Brighton, residents remained unconcerned by the latest developments. In Hove, the Grenadier pub remains open after a man who was diagnosed with coronavirus was served there a few days ago. There were about a dozen customers watching football and enjoying a pint on Monday afternoon. Although all staff who were on duty at the time the man was hosted had been told to isolate themselves, there were still plenty of workers behind the bar. The pub\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cWe are following the advice and working closely with Public Health England who have advised us that there is minimal ongoing risk of infection to either guests or staff, and as such the pub remains open for business as usual.\u201d At Brighton train station, travellers also seemed unperturbed, despite the giant billboard displaying headlines about the Brighton \u201csuper-spreader\u201d \u2013 a term used to describe the man who contracted the disease in Singapore and had since passed it on to a number of other persons. John Stephen, 68, a retired magazine journalist said he was not bothered by the situation, but knew many others were. \u201cThere\u2019s a Chinese supermarket down there and I saw some girls walking past covering their faces \u2013 it seems to bother other people, but I think a lot of it is racism.\u201d There were a couple of people wearing protective face masks, but the vast majority around the station were not taking any visible extra precautions. \u201cI\u2019m not perturbed but I am a little concerned about the racism surrounding it,\u201d Stephen added. Brighton and Hove city council said it was working closely with Public Health England (PHE) to respond to the situation. A council statement said: \u201cThe latest patients from our city have been transferred to specialist NHS centres, and healthcare workers are using robust infection control measures to prevent any possible further spread of the virus.\u201d It said PHE was prioritising speaking to those with close and sustained contact with confirmed cases. \u2022 The headline and opening paragraph of this article were amended on 12 February 2020 to better reflect the content of the piece.",

      "bodyText": "Kevin Foster, a Home Office minister, has defended government plans to deport 50 people to Jamaica tomorrow, despite the fact that some of them came to the UK as children. Responding to an urgent question tabled by the Labour MP David Lammy, Foster said that the people being deported had collectively been sentenced to a total of 300 years in prison and that the government was deporting them to comply with rules introduced by Labour to protect the public from serious and persistent offenders. But Lammy and other Labour MPs said that there was a danger of the government perpetrating an injustice of the kind inflicted on the Windrush generation, and that the deportations should be halted pending the publication of the Windrush lessons learned review. According to BBC\u2019s Newsnight, one draft of the lessons learned report recommended that the government consider ending the deportation of offenders who came to the UK as children. Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, has said that it is backing Rebecca Long-Bailey to be the next leader of the Labour party, and Angela Rayner to be the deputy leader. Sinn F\u00e9in has declared victory in Ireland\u2019s general election and called for talks with other main parties to form a coalition government. And here is Lisa O\u2019Carroll\u2019s take on what this means for the UK. Ministers are actively looking into Boris Johnson\u2019s idea of a road bridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland, Downing Street has said, rejecting scepticism from engineers and criticism of the prime minister\u2019s mixed record on delivering bridges. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has confirmed that the UK will introduce import controls on EU goods at the border from the start of 2021. He also said there were would be no measures to protect businesses in the event of a possible no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020, of the kind that were planned in 2019, because \u201cbusinesses have time to prepare.\u201d Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour leadership campaign team has reiterated its concern after the party launched an investigation into alleged misuse of data, with one of his key supporters calling the claims \u201cscurrilous\u201d and baseless. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has formally apologised in parliament to Yvette Cooper after a Conservative activist was jailed for sending messages threatening to pay \u201ccrackheads\u201d \u00a3100 to beat up the Labour MP. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The legal challenge against the government plan to deport 50 people to Jamaica tomorrow (see 12.32pm) has been refused, the BBC\u2019s Adina Campbell reports. This is from Steve Back, the photographer who covers Downing Street and who tweets as @PoliticalPics. And here is a gloss on what it means from Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor. The SNP has issued its own comment on Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a bridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland, and it is more critical than Nicola Sturgeon was when she was asked about this earlier. (See 3.30pm.) An SNP spokesperson said: It is going to take more than a bridge to undo the harm to EU relations that the Tory government has caused with its extreme Brexit plans, and given Boris Johnson\u2019s failed history of unwanted and over budget bridge projects we are going to take a lot of convincing. The SNP will always welcome engagement with how we can strengthen relations with Northern Ireland and Ireland, but we will focus on practical and achievable ideas - not unsubstantiated vanity projects and baseless briefings which this Tory Prime Minister is all too familiar. The full text of Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s speech to the European Policy Centre earlier is now here, on the Scottish government\u2019s website. A bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland would be bad new for ferry operators, and so understandably the UK Chamber of Shipping is not keen. It has just issued this statement on the PM\u2019s proposal. We fully support any initiative which seeks to improve trade and tourism links. However, there are already a range of ferry operators taking tourists and trade between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Spending \u00a315bn-\u00a320bn of taxpayers\u2019 money on a bridge simply to replicate what those ferries already do is unnecessary. The money could be far better spent improving road and rail links to our ports across the UK. These are from my colleague Anushka Asthana, who presents the Guardian\u2019s flagship podcast, Today in Focus. They are regularly outstanding, and this episode is particularly fascinating. Labour\u2019s Stephen Doughty says Foster is asking MPs to trust a department that regularly makes mistake. He says the Home Office has admitted wrongly detaining 312 people in just one year. And it will not say how many people have been wrongly deported, he says. Foster says it would be wrong for the government to not deport these people, because that would leave the public at risk. And that\u2019s it. The UQ is over. Labour\u2019s Shabana Mahmood says Foster should not be hiding behind the 2007 legislation when he knows that the independent review of lessons learnt from Windrush will say that people who came to the UK in childhood should not be deported. Foster says the government is not hiding behind the 2007 law; it is implementing it. Labour\u2019s Claudia Webbe asks if any of those facing deportation have had access to legal advice and representation. Foster says they have all gone through the criminal justice system. Labour\u2019s Stephen Timms asks Foster to confirm that there will be 50 people on the flight tomorrow. How many came to the UK in childhood? Foster says he will not comment on individuals, or on the numbers. But he says they all meet the threshold for deportation. Labour\u2019s Taiwo Owatemi says one of the people being deported was jailed some time ago. Is if fair for someone to be punished twice of an offence? Foster says the deportations are required by law. Alex Chalk, a Conservative, asks Foster to confirm that the government would be subject to judicial review if it did not deport these individuals. Foster says this is an interesting point. He says if the deportations did not go ahead, the government would be answerable to any potential future victims. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, asks Foster to give details of the offences committed by those people being deported, and the age at which they came to the UK. Foster says all the offences meet the threshold set by the act. These are people who are serious or persistent offenders, he says. Foster says it is unbelievable that Labour wants to associate the Windrush generation with a group of serious offenders. Vicky Ford, a Conservative, asks Foster if he has looked at the casework for every individual being deported and assured himself that they are all \u201cpersistent and serious\u201d offenders. Foster says he has looked at the list. He says he cannot comment on individual cases, but all these cases have been properly reviewed, he says. Labour\u2019s Marsha de Cordova says Kevin Foster\u2019s attitudes is \u201cshameful\u201d. She says one of her constituents is being deported having served a seven-month sentence in 2015. She says the government should accept the recommendations of the review of lessons to be learnt from Windrush. She asks Foster why he is not interested in the consequences of what he is doing. Foster says the government is worried about the consequences of allowing criminals to stay in the UK to commit further crimes. Here is some comment from journalists on the tone being adopted by the Home Office minister Kevin Foster. From the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush From my colleague Peter Walker Stewart McDonald, the SNP\u2019s justice spokesman, says some of those being deported tomorrow have much stronger connections with Britain than with Jamaica. He says these deportations will leave 41 children without fathers, and nine Britons without a husband or a father. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, says there is real concern in the community about this mass deportation flight. She says Kevin Foster\u2019s dismissive attitude implies he is dismissing all the concerns of the community. Foster says the law is clear; the government is obliged to make deportation orders. And the law is applied in accordance with the offences committed by offenders, not their nationality. Lammy is responding to Foster. He asks Foster how he can be sure that none of the people facing deportation to Jamaica are actually British citizens, in the light of the experience of the Windrush generation. And he asks Foster to confirm that some of them came to the UK were very young. He says the government is showing disrespect for the contribution of West Indian, Caribbean and black people to this country. Foster says none of those being deported tomorrow are Britons. He says that between them they have been sentenced to 300 years in jail. It is wrong to compare them to the Windrush generation, he says. That fact that Labour is implying otherwise implies Labour has \u201clost the plot\u201d, he says. The Labour MP David Lammy asks for a Commons statement on the government\u2019s suppression of the review of its treatment of the Windrush generation, and its plans for a deportation flight tomorrow. Kevin Foster, a Home Office minister, is replying. He says the government has acted swiftly to address the injustices suffered by the Windrush generation. He says some 8,000 people have received some form of documentation and there have been 5,000 grants of citizenship, he says. He says there have been news stories recently citing a draft report from last summer. He won\u2019t comment on leaked reports, he says. But he says the lessons learnt report has not been completed. When it is available, the Home Office will publish it. As for the flight tomorrow, he says the home secretary is required by law to issue a deportation order for people subject to deportation. He says these laws were drawn up when Labour was in office. He says the deportation rules relate to the offences committed by people, not where they come from. He says he does not accept that there is any similarity with the Windrush generation. Here are the main points from Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A at the European Policy Centre in Brussels this afternoon. Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, dismissed Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a bridge linking Scotland to Northern Ireland as a \u201cdiversionary tactic\u201d and said there were better ways of spending the money. Asked about the plan, she said: Boris Johnson has promised lots of physical bridges in his political career so far. He hasn\u2019t delivered, to the best of my knowledge, a single one of them. I bow to nobody in my ambitions for Scotland, and my ambitions for Scotland to be connected to Ireland and to Europe. But I do think there are big practical questions over the feasibility and deliverability of this \u2013 not just the distance, but the depth of the water, there\u2019s an old munitions dump underneath it. We\u2019ll see where it goes. I certainly don\u2019t close my eyes, or close my mind, to suggestions like this. But I suspect from Boris Johnson it\u2019s more a diversionary tactic \u2013 to have people talking about that rather than some of the real issues we are grappling with in both Scotland and Ireland. I would say, if you\u2019ve got \u00a320bn or whatever it might take to build such a bridge going spare just now, I\u2019m sure the Scottish government and the Northern Ireland executive could find lots of ways to spend it on possibly more important priorities. She claimed that Johnson was refusing to keep the UK aligned to EU regulations after Brexit because he wanted to lower standards. She said that Johnson had not given any examples of how divergence could benefit the UK. She went on: The only possible reason for wanting the freedom to diverge is if you want to adopt lower standards than the EU does. She said Scotland would remain aligned with EU rules so as to make it easier for Scotland to rejoin the EU in due course. This is from the BBC\u2019s Glenn Campbell. She said she thought it was possible that Boris Johnson could abandon his determination not to allow an extension to the post-Brexit transition. (See 2.26pm.) She said the COP 26 climate change summit in Glasgow in November could be the most important event happening in the world this year. This is from the BBC\u2019s Natalie Higgins. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, has activated the government\u2019s emergency Bellwin scheme for areas in the north of England affected by Storm Ciara, the Press Association reports. The scheme - activated for qualifying areas in West Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire - enables local authorities dealing with the storm to apply to have all of the eligible costs they incur, above a threshold, to be reimbursed by the government. On the subject of the post-Brexit transition (see 2.26pm), Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, said at an event this morning that there would be no extension. Gove was giving a speech at an event for \u201cUK border stakeholders\u201d (as No 10 describes them). But, intriguingly, there might be a phased implementation, apparently. These are from Peter MacSwiney, chairman of ASM UK, which provides customs clearance software. This is interesting. Last week my colleague Patrick Wintour reported that Foreign Office officials are under strict instructions not to refer to the transition period as an implementation period, even though under Theresa May implementation period was the government\u2019s approved terminology. Peter Foster, the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, had a very plausible theory as to why this might be. The Cabinet Office has not released a copy of Gove\u2019s speech yet, but I will post more on it if I ever get a copy. Q: Do you think there is any chance of Boris Johnson changing his mind in relation to ruling out an extension to the post-Brexit transition? Sturgeon says she has to assume that what the UK government says about ruling out an extension is what they mean. But it would not be beyond the bounds of possibility, and not inconsistent with the way he has behaved before, if he were to change his mind. So she won\u2019t rule it out, she says. Sturgeon says she thinks it is possible that Boris Johnson could abandon his determination not to allow an extension to the post-Brexit transition. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary shortly. Q: Have you had any contact from the police in relation to Derek Mackay\u2019s conduct? And do you think he should resign as an MSP? Sturgeon says she has not had any contact over this from the police. As for whether Mackay should stand down as an MSP, she says he should reflect on this. But it is not a decision for the SNP, she says. Q: Lawyers argue that Scotland does not need Westminster\u2019s permission to have a referendum, or declare independence. Kosovo was able to declare its independence unilaterally? Sturgeon says she is a democrat. For Scotland to legitimately become independence, you have to demonstrate that. She says opinion polls are not enough. She jokes that, however tempting just declaring independence might be, she thinks others would not agree. As for holding a referendum without Westminster\u2019s approval, she says whether or not Edinburgh can do this has not been tested in court. She is not ruling this out, she says. It may have to be tested. But she says going to court always involves uncertainty. That is why she wants the UK government to grant permission for a referendum. She repeats the point about thinking that Johnson will not be able to resist the pressure for one. Q: What do you think of the plan for a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland? Sturgeon says Boris Johnson has promised lots of bridges in the past. But they have never been built. She says she thinks there would be many practical difficulties, not least the depth of the water and the munitions dump. (See 1.56pm.) She goes on: I don\u2019t close my mind to suggestions like this. But I suspect from Boris Johnson it\u2019s a diversionary tactic. She says, if Johnson has got a spare \u00a320bn, the Scottish government and Northern Ireland executive could suggest better ways of spending the money. On Scottish independence, Sturgeon says she wants to have a referendum that is seen as legal. There is no point having one not seen as legitimate, she says. She says people think the deadlock between London and Edinburgh won\u2019t be broken. But she says she does not agree; she thinks Boris Johnson realises he has to win the argument. She says that is why the UK government is making the case for the union in Scotland. As for what currency an independent Scotland would use, she says it would start using sterling, before moving to its own currency. As for the claim that independence would lead to controls at the border, Sturgeon says that it is Brexit that creates problems at the border, not independence. Nicola Sturgeon says the SNP has been critical of the common fisheries policy for years. But she says she thinks the UK government will find it hard to meet the promises it has made to Scottish fishermen. Nicola Sturgeon has finished her speech to the European Policy Centre in Brussels. She is now taking questions. There is a live feed here. The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn has more on the problem posed by unexploded ordnance (UXO) to the proposal to build a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland. Richard Burgon, a candidate for the Labour deputy leadership, says there is a lesson for his party from Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s success in the Irish general election. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is giving a speech to the European Policy Centre in Brussels. Here are some excerpts, from the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge. There is one urgent question in the Commons today, on the planned deportation flight to Jamaica, and one statement, on the flooding. On the subject of a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland, it is worth flagging up this letter on the subject, sent to the Sunday Times in 2018 after the paper first reported that Boris Johnson was interested in the idea. It is from a a retired offshore engineer who said the idea was \u201cabout as feasible as building a bridge to the moon\u201d. And here is what the Labour MP Wes Streeting is saying about the bridge plan. Last summer my colleague Matthew Weaver calculated that projects championed by Boris Johnson when he was London mayor, that were all subject to legitimate criticism, cost a total of \u00a3940m. The worst example was probably the doomed garden bridge, which cost the public more than \u00a340m before it was abandoned with nothing to show for all the time and money lavished on it, but Matthew identifies seven other projects where Johnson\u2019s passion for new infrastructure led to questionable spending decisions. Since Matthew wrote his piece, fresh problems have emerged with Johnson\u2019s Routemaster buses. As my colleague Gywn Topham wrote last month, Transport for London is going to convert them to stop passengers boarding the buses at the back - supposedly one of the main advantages of the Routemaster design - because they have realised the feature encourages fare dodging. Here is Andrew Adonis, the Labour former transport secretary, on Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal for a bridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland. It was the Mail on Sunday that first seems to have broken the bridge story at the weekend, not the Sun. It is also worth noting that No 10 estimate for what this might cost seems to have risen from \u00a315bn to \u00a320bn within just five months. (See 12.17pm.) My colleague Kate Proctor points out various potential problems with building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland. Another potential problem is that, if Boris Johnson were to go ahead with the project, it is not impossible that, by the time it was actually finished, Scotland could have voted for independence and Northern Ireland could have voted for reunification with the Republic of Ireland. It could end up as a bridge between two countries no longer part of the UK. Lawyers are launching a judicial review in an attempt to halt a flight deporting 50 people to Jamaica amid widespread calls for the jet to be grounded, PA Media reports. Duncan Lewis Solicitors, which is representing 15 people due to be on the flight, is expected to file the papers at the high court imminently and have called for an urgent oral hearing on Monday afternoon to discuss the matter. PA says the move comes after the government insisted it would be pressing ahead with the flight, which is thought to be leaving the UK at 6.30am on Tuesday. The Rebecca Long-Bailey campaign has sought to draw a line under the row about alleged breaches of data rules in the campaign. (See 9.30am.) A spokesman for the campaign said: The investigation into Keir Starmer\u2019s campaign over an alleged data breach should not be allowed to distract from a moment of significant importance in determining the future direction of our party. As Rebecca\u2019s campaign has said previously, the accessibility of members\u2019 data stemmed from a failure to close [phone banking app] Dialogue at the end of the general election campaign. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has described the notion of building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland as \u201ccrazy\u201d. The question at the No 10 lobby briefing about the proposed bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland was prompted by this story by Natasha Clark in the Sun, saying part of the link could take the form of a tunnel. She says the bridge could run from Portpatrick in Scotland to Larne in Northern Ireland. Here is an extract from her story. The bridge, made of steel and concrete, would consist of two levels - one for cars and one for a railway. Part of it could be a tunnel too, as a way of dealing with the offshore dumpsite Beaufort\u2019s Dyke. Unexploded World War Two bombs are believed to be one of the risks of the project, which lie near the dump. An artificial island around 2.5 miles long and 500 yards wide is likely to link the bridge to the tunnel. Under one version of Boris\u2019 plan, the bridge would run from the Scottish coast over the trench, before becoming a tunnel for the final stretch to Northern Ireland. Local geography might even dictate the need for two artificial islands to span the North Channel. Johnson has in the past signalled that he favours in principle building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland - for example, here, in September, and here, in the Queen\u2019s speech debate in December - but Downing Street has never been as explicit as it was this morning (see 11.26am) in saying that officials are working on the idea. UPDATE: Sorry, it seems to have been Glen Owen in the Mail on Sunday who had this story first. When Johnson was speaking about the proposal in September, he said it might cost \u00a315bn. Five months later, according to the Mail on Sunday, the estimated cost now seems to have risen to \u00a320bn. Asked about the Daily Mail story about a rift between Dominic Cummings and Carrie Symonds (see 10.43am), the spokesman says he does not recognise the thrust of what the story is saying. And that\u2019s it. The briefing is over. Q: Is levelling up about spreading opportunity, or making the country more equal? The spokesman says the PM\u2019s agenda is about both opportunity and outcome. Q: Is the government considering a mansion tax? The spokesman says he does not comment on budget matters. And he sidesteps a question on the reshuffle too. Asked about the Irish elections, the spokesman says close links between the UK and Ireland will continue. UPDATE: The spokesman said: We are of course following the results of the Irish election carefully. The UK and Ireland are close neighbours and friends and we look forward to continuing to work together. The close relationship between the UK and Ireland will continue regardless of the election result. Q: Is the government committed to building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland? The spokesman says he has nothing to add to what the PM said about this at PMQs a few weeks ago. The PM said the idea had some merit. So officials are looking into this, he says. He says: Work is underway looking into the idea of a bridge. Q: Is the PM concerned that his previous record with bridges does not inspire confidence? The spokesman does not accept this. He says: The PM is ambitious in terms of infrastructure projects. He is looking at a wide range of schemes across the United Kingdom that could boost productivity. Asked for more detail of the work being undertaken, the spokesman says he has not more to add. Q: Can you say roughly how many officials are working on this? No, says the spokesman. Q: Recently the Treasury told ministers not to waste money on projects. Would this count as a waste of money? The spokesman did not accept this. Q: But it is being seriously considered? Yes, says the spokesman. Q: Should the public be worried about coronavirus? The spokesman says the NHS is extremely well prepared. Q: But won\u2019t some people be concerned by the decision to declare it a serious and imminent threat? The spokesman says the language reflects the steps being taken. But the chief medical officer says the threat is moderate, he says. Q: When did the government learn that Anne Sacoolas was a US spy? The spokesman says the Foreign Office has said she was notified to the UK government as the spouse of a US official, with no official role. Q: Was the Foreign Office misled? The spokesman says he has nothing to add. The spokesman also says that a host government has to be notified of a diplomat\u2019s role for them to be covered by diplomatic immunity. Q: Will you get an announcement on immigration before the end of the week? The spokesman says the government is not planning to publish anything this week. Q: Rishi Sunak said this morning the Jamaicans due to be deported tomorrow had committed serious offences. Do you have details? The spokesman says some of those due to be deported have been convicted of manslaughter, rape, violence or drug dealing. He says it is long-standing policy that foreign offenders sentenced to more than 12 months are considered for deportation. He says the people on tomorrow\u2019s flight will come into this category. It\u2019s correct to say that some of those on board are convicted of manslaughter, rape, violence and drug dealing. It is long-standing government policy that any foreign national offender sentenced to 12 months or more in prison should be considered for deportation. The policy is designed to protect the public. Q: But Sunak implied most of the offenders had committed crimes like manslaughter? The spokesman repeats the point about 12-month sentences. The spokesman also says that people facing deportation can appeal. Q: Last week Robert Jenrick said he would like to see a British embassy in Jerusalem. Is this government policy? The spokesman says he did not see that. He will chase it up, and come back with an answer later. The Downing Street lobby briefing has started. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman says Michael Gove will be giving a speech today about border arrangements at the end of the year. The spokesman refuses to say when the HS2 announcement will come, even though it has been widely reported that it will come on Tuesday. He confirms that cabinet will have to sign it off. I\u2019m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing. I\u2019ll have my laptop, and so I will probably be posting updates as it goes along, but the embargo arrangements on these briefings are a bit fluid at the moment and so that will depend on whether the embargo gets lifted. One story that may come up is a report by Simon Walters in the Daily Mail claiming there has been \u201ca falling-out between Boris Johnson\u2019s partner Carrie Symonds and his chief adviser Dominic Cummings over the cabinet reshuffle\u201d. Walters writes: Well-placed Treasury sources say Miss Symonds is backing ministers who say Mr Cummings\u2019 aggressive approach towards ministers, officials and journalists is damaging the Prime Minister. The rift has been fuelled by reports that Mr Cummings urged Mr Johnson to fire two ministers with close links to Miss Symonds: Chancellor Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. It is understood Mr Johnson has refused to sack Mr Javid in the reshuffle expected this week, but the fate of Mr Wallace is less clear. In addition, Mr Cummings is believed to be planning to fire several Conservative ministerial special advisers, including some with connections to Miss Symonds. Insiders fear Mr Johnson is in danger of being caught in the middle of a damaging power struggle between the two most powerful members of his No 10 kitchen Cabinet of key advisers. David Henig, the former civil servant and trade expert who now runs the UK Trade Policy Project, has been tweeting about the government\u2019s freeports plan today. Henig also accused Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, of not accepting that freeports can and do operate within the EU. To be fair to Sunak, elsewhere in his Sky interview he claimed that the UK would be able to operate freeports in a more ambitious way than when it tried them when it was in the EU. He said the EU\u2019s definition of a freeport was \u201cvery narrow\u201d. For more on freeports, this Institute for Government briefing is helpful. Here\u2019s an extract. Economic studies have found the main advantage of freeports is that they encourage imports by lowering duty and paperwork costs. Manufacturing businesses that are inside the freeport can benefit from cheaper imported inputs/components in comparison to those outside the area. On the other hand, the UK Trade Policy Observatory (UKTPO) cautions that the evidence of wider economic benefits of freeports and other zones are mixed, as they depend heavily on the design, access to transport infrastructure, skilled labour and capital within the zone in question. There is also a risk that freeports and zones don\u2019t create new economic activity but rather divert existing business into the area with the allure of tax breaks \u2013 at a cost to the taxpayer in the form of lost revenue. Recently Lisa Nandy, a Labour leadership candidate, said that Twitter was causing \u201creal problems\u201d for the left because it gave people a misleading view of public opinion. Now Clive Lewis, who was interested himself in running for the Labour leadership but could not get enough backing from MPs, says he is giving it up himself. This blog focuses on UK politics, but no country is closer to the UK than Ireland, or more entwined with its politics (at least in one region) than Ireland, and so there will be intense interest in what is happening in Dublin following Saturday\u2019s election. Ireland uses the single transferable vote with multi-member constituencies, which means counting the results can take a while. My colleague Se\u00e1n Clarke is keeping a tally of the results here. Here is my colleague Rory Carroll\u2019s overnight story. This morning Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn F\u00e9in president, told RTE that she thought the best outcome for Ireland would be government without Fianna Fail or Fine Gael. The Sinn F\u00e9in leader has made contact with a number of smaller groupings, according to the Press Association. McDonald said: This vote for Sinn F\u00e9in is for Sinn F\u00e9in to be in government, for Sinn F\u00e9in to make a difference, for Sinn F\u00e9in to be tested, for Sinn F\u00e9in to deliver ... There are very serious issues facing our society and we have a duty and feel that responsibility very keenly to deliver solutions. We want to talk to anyone who is interested in delivering a programme for government, that is about getting to grips with the housing crisis and solving it, getting to grips with the crisis in health and giving families and workers a break and giving a new lease of life to government. Yesterday the BBC ran a report saying that the Labour party had formally reported members of Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership campaign team to the information commissioner\u2019s office, accusing them of misusing the membership database. The Starmer camp described that claims that it had done anything wrong as \u201cutter nonsense\u201d, saying that the Labour letter to the ICO was in fact sent in response to the Starmer campaign warning about a potential abuse of the database rules by Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s campaign. This morning David Lammy, the Labour MP and vice chairman of Starmer\u2019s campaign, said the allegations against his side were \u201cscurrilous\u201d. He told the Today programme: It didn\u2019t happen. There was no data-scraping. I can say categorically that this did not happen and it\u2019s denied fundamentally. There was no attempt by the campaign to do this - it\u2019s scurrilous to suggest so and I\u2019m quite sure that the information commissioner will find the allegations completely untrue. Good morning. Within the last hour or so the government has declared the coronavirus outbreak a serious and imminent threat to public health, in a move that means people with the illness can be forcibly quarantined. My colleague Frances Perraudin has the full story here, and my colleague Aamna Mohdin is covering this on a coronavirus outbreak live blog. In non-coronavirus news, the government has this morning launched a consultation on creating up to 10 freeports and Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has been on Sky News promoting the plan. There were two main news lines. Sunak dismissed claims that free ports would facilitate tax avoidance as a red herring. When Sky\u2019s Kay Burley put this to him, he replied: I absolutely don\u2019t think they do [facilitate tax avoidance] and obviously you have stringent rules. It\u2019s worth pointing out that the EU is pretty much the only place in the world that doesn\u2019t use freeports, for example there are over 200 in the US, employing several hundred thousand people, hundreds, billions of dollars of trade happens in those areas and that\u2019s replicated around the world. The US head of customs and border protection told me a while ago he thinks their free trade zones are actually more secure than their regular ports, because they go through vetting with the customs bodies before they get given freeport status, and they have dedicated agents in the freeports, so I think that\u2019s a bit of a red herring. Sunak defended government plans to deport dozens of Jamaicans this week, despite the fact that many of them have been in the UK since childhood. Asked about the move, he said: What that plane is about is deporting foreign national criminals. Many of these people have committed crimes such as manslaughter, rape, other very serious offences. I think it\u2019s right and the British public would expect us to be able to deport foreign national criminals - that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here. Regardless of the country they come from, it\u2019s a policy that\u2019s been in place. It\u2019s reasonable, it\u2019s proportionate, and something the British people would expect us to do for foreign criminals who have committed very serious crimes should be sent back to their countries where they have a right to reside elsewhere. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 11am: The committee on standards in public life publishes a report on artificial intelligence. 2.30pm: Priti Patel, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s housing spokesman, Eoin \u00d3 Broin, is among the party\u2019s strongest media performers and has pledged a series of policies including a rent freeze, which has secured the votes of a generation trapped in a spiral of eye-watering rents or stuck at home with their parents.</p> \n<p>By contrast, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, which were in a confidence-and-supply arrangement during the last government, have been accused of inaction on the issue, putting landlords\u2019 needs above those of renters.

      "body": "<p>In 2015, during an escalation of violence in Jerusalem, a just-turned-teenage Palestinian boy and his older cousin were involved in a stabbing that left two young Israelis injured \u2013 critically in the case of one, a 13-year-old boy. The elder cousin, Hassan, was shot dead by police. The younger, Ahmad, was hit by a car and lay bleeding on the ground as a crowd gathered. They shouted: \u201cDie you motherfucker\u201d and urged police to \u201cput a bullet in his head\u201d. The shockingly young ages of the boys sent the story around the world. For Israeli lawyer Lea Tsemel, who defends Palestinians, it led to one of the most fraught conflicts of her decades-long career.</p> <p>Advocate, an award-winning documentary by Israeli film-makers Rachel Leah Jones and Philippe Bellaiche, chronicles the 75-year-old lawyer\u2019s life and work. The film provides a compelling insight into the uneasy complexities of representing Palestinians in Israeli courts, where the occupiers effectively judge the occupied in a system that can\u2019t escape the bloody conflict raging between the two sides.</p> <p>Early in the film, as the camera sweeps along the rows of battered files that crowd Tsemel\u2019s office, we see the nature of her work spelled out in their headings: possession of a weapon, stone throwing, accessory to murder, suicide bombings. It\u2019s a life spent losing inside courtrooms and facing attacks outside them. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6162tlQLnS4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6162tlQLnS4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6162tlQLnS4\">Watch a trailer for Advocate</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The film contains footage of a TV interview with Tsemel in the 1990s, in which she discusses what drives her to defend Palestinians. The presenter says to her: \u201cIt\u2019s as if you identify with them!\u201d They also tally all the verbal attacks the lawyer has faced: traitor, leftist, devil\u2019s advocate.

      "bodyText": "In 2015, during an escalation of violence in Jerusalem, a just-turned-teenage Palestinian boy and his older cousin were involved in a stabbing that left two young Israelis injured \u2013 critically in the case of one, a 13-year-old boy. The elder cousin, Hassan, was shot dead by police. The younger, Ahmad, was hit by a car and lay bleeding on the ground as a crowd gathered. They shouted: \u201cDie you motherfucker\u201d and urged police to \u201cput a bullet in his head\u201d. The shockingly young ages of the boys sent the story around the world. For Israeli lawyer Lea Tsemel, who defends Palestinians, it led to one of the most fraught conflicts of her decades-long career. Advocate, an award-winning documentary by Israeli film-makers Rachel Leah Jones and Philippe Bellaiche, chronicles the 75-year-old lawyer\u2019s life and work. The film provides a compelling insight into the uneasy complexities of representing Palestinians in Israeli courts, where the occupiers effectively judge the occupied in a system that can\u2019t escape the bloody conflict raging between the two sides. Early in the film, as the camera sweeps along the rows of battered files that crowd Tsemel\u2019s office, we see the nature of her work spelled out in their headings: possession of a weapon, stone throwing, accessory to murder, suicide bombings. It\u2019s a life spent losing inside courtrooms and facing attacks outside them. The film contains footage of a TV interview with Tsemel in the 1990s, in which she discusses what drives her to defend Palestinians. The presenter says to her: \u201cIt\u2019s as if you identify with them!\u201d They also tally all the verbal attacks the lawyer has faced: traitor, leftist, devil\u2019s advocate. At one point the presenter says: \u201cI think that terrorists are no different to rapists and murderers.\u201d Tsemel replies that, instead of \u201cterrorists\u201d, other people in the world might call some Palestinians \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d. To protect the identity of defendants, the film sometimes uses animated images projected on to legal and press archives \u2013 the background documents reminding us that this story cannot be separated from a historical and political context. In one animated sequence, Ahmad passes round a packet of sweets outside the courtroom at his father\u2019s request. His teenage awkwardness seems familiar and at the same time completely at odds with his involvement in the conflict.

Later the government issued an official update confirming checks on both imports and exports. The update warned that the \u201cpolicy easements put in place for a potential no-deal exit will not be reintroduced as businesses have time to prepare\u201d. The \u201ceasements\u201d that will not apply include deferred VAT payments on imports, which the government had considered in a no-deal plan. Echoing Boris Johnson\u2019s comments in a speech last week, Gove spoke of pursuing a Canada or Australian-type deal, which EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has said was \u201ccode for no deal\u201d as the bloc does not have a deal with Australia. According to attendees, Gove was also adamant that the government would stick to its vow to no longer follow EU rules that would allow it to minimise future barriers in cross-border trade. \u201cThe only way in which you could avoid those customs procedures and regulatory checks would be if you were to align with EU law and if you were to align with EU law we would be undermining the basis on which the prime minister secured the mandate at the general election to affirm our departure,\u201d Gove said in comments that were recorded. However, Gove did seem to distance himself from recent comments by the chancellor, Sajid Javid, that suggested business should stop complaining about future trade barriers as they have known about Brexit since 2016. The Food and Drink Federation raised concerns about the lack of time to deliver the plans adding that \u201cany additional friction into the UK-EU trading relationship will inevitably have a cost for businesses, consumers and shoppers\u201d. It called on the government to \u201clead the way\u201d and \u201cproceed at pace\u201d to start building the border inspection posts and ensure regulators such as the Food Standards Agency have sufficient resources for \u201cthese new responsibilities\u201d.

Gove\u2019s address is the first official confirmation on the detailed border checks to come, something industry leaders particularly in car manufacturing and in agriculture have campaigned against. He told the London event it was the government\u2019s aspiration to make sure trading with the EU was \u201cas smooth and trouble free as possible\u201d but that \u201cwe also need to ensure that people are ready for the regulatory checks that will follow\u201d.

The number of injuries has been steadily increasing since the Pentagon began releasing data on the injuries about a week after the 8 January attack at al-Asad airbase in Iraq. Pentagon officials have warned that the number will continue to change. The department said 76 of the service members have returned to duty, while 26 are in Germany or the United States for treatment, and another seven are on their way from Iraq to Germany for evaluation and treatment. Donald Trump had previously said that the US \u201csuffered no casualties\u201d from the attack, which was a reprisal for the US drone strike assassination of the Iranian Gen Qassem Suleimani. Questioned later about reports of brain injury, Trump downplayed their severity: \u201cI heard that they had headaches. And a couple of other things. But I would say, and I can report, it is not very serious.\u201d Speaking after Trump\u2019s remarks, Michael Kaplen, the chair of the New York State Traumatic Brain Injury Services Coordinating Council and past president of the Brain Injury Association of New York State, said that the condition is a \u201clife-altering\u201d injury. \u201cIt\u2019s physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral consequences affect every aspect of an individual\u2019s life,\u201d he said. \u201cA brain injury is only \u2018mild\u2019 if it is someone else\u2019s brain. There is nothing \u2018mild\u2019 about a mild brain injury.\u201d The Army general Mark Milley, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last month that the service members suffering from traumatic brain injuries had been diagnosed with mild cases. He added the diagnosis could change as time went on. Pentagon officials have repeatedly said there has been no effort to minimize or delay information on concussive injuries. But the disclosures following Tehran\u2019s attack have renewed questions over the US military\u2019s policy regarding how it internally reports suspected brain injuries and whether they are treated publicly with the same urgency as loss of limb or life.",

Cooper used Home Office questions in the Commons to seek an apology after Joshua Spencer was jailed last week for nine weeks, and to ask why Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns gave Spencer a character reference at the court case. The 25-year-old was arrested in April last year and stood for the Conservatives in May\u2019s local elections. He attended Cooper\u2019s general election count in December as a representative of the Conservative party despite being under investigation by West Yorkshire police at the time. Cooper told the home secretary that she had received an apology from the local Conservative association. She said: \u201cBut it is a concern to me that there been, thus far, no similar condemnation or sense of regret expressed by the national party. In a letter to me from the national chair in response to this issue, the strongest it said was: \u2018Intimidating behaviour has no place in our politics.\u2019\u201d Cooper said she was disappointed that Jenkyns had chosen to give a very positive character reference for this individual, without contacting her first.

In terms of the national party response, she can take it from me, right now, that I am hugely apologetic for what she has had to put up with.\u201d On the character reference by Jenkyns, Patel said: \u201cMy understanding is that her comments were in support very much of giving the individual some help and support that that individual needed in terms of access to mental health.\u201d Spencer pleaded guilty in January to sending malicious messages about Cooper, a former work and pensions secretary who has been MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford since 1997. In a message sent last April to a man he met online, Spencer suggested Cooper should \u201cpay\u201d for trying to thwart a no-deal Brexit, after MPs voted to stop the UK leaving the EU on 29 March 2019 as planned. He wrote: \u201cWe should have left [with] no deal on the 29th before the whore Yvette got her hands on to it and voted to revoke democracy. She will pay.

Tom Grimes, the head of whistleblowing at NHS Improvement \u2013 the body that oversees patient safety \u2013 has not responded to a request to clarify the issue. An NHS spokesman said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that the review now establishes the facts.\u201d</p> <p>The terms of reference for the inquiry make clear it will examine \u201cany advice/interactions the trust sought from other relevant bodies\u201d about the demand for biometric data.</p> <p>The review was ordered by Hancock after a string of Guardian revelations about intimidation of doctors, who complained about a \u201cculture of fear\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Misleading claims by bosses at the health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s local hospital that the NHS and regulators approved a controversial decision to fingerprint doctors in a hunt for a whistleblower are to be investigated. In an urgent inquiry the accuracy of a statement by West Suffolk hospital will be examined after the Guardian revealed in December it had demanded fingerprints and handwriting samples from staff. The hospital, in Bury St Edmunds, said the tactics had been \u201cbacked\u201d by the NHS\u2019s head of whistleblowing and the regulator, the Care Quality Commission. But the accuracy of that statement appears to be unravelling after the CQC said it did not endorse the tactics, which it criticised in a recent hard-hitting report as \u201cunprecedented and concerning\u201d. The Guardian can now disclose the commission told the trust to withdraw the statement and make clear the watchdog had not approved its actions. A message from hospital managers to staff, seen by the Guardian, stated: \u201cWe would like to clarify that the CQC was not involved in the process or decision-making relating to the actions we undertook to investigate the serious incident and we are sorry if this was not clear. \u201cThe CQC was made aware of the trust\u2019s decisions and actions as part of its regulatory role and inspection process, and takes the raising of concerns by staff incredibly seriously.\u201d The NHS has refused to say whether it signed off the trust\u2019s tactics. Tom Grimes, the head of whistleblowing at NHS Improvement \u2013 the body that oversees patient safety \u2013 has not responded to a request to clarify the issue. An NHS spokesman said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that the review now establishes the facts.\u201d The terms of reference for the inquiry make clear it will examine \u201cany advice/interactions the trust sought from other relevant bodies\u201d about the demand for biometric data. The review was ordered by Hancock after a string of Guardian revelations about intimidation of doctors, who complained about a \u201cculture of fear\u201d. The health secretary has recused himself from the rapid assessment because he is a local MP. Doctors at the trust have accused him of ignoring their concerns about bullying. Those concerns were centred on the hospital\u2019s extraordinary attempts to identify a member of staff who tipped off Jon Warby about a potentially botched operation before his wife Susan\u2019s death in August 2018. The anonymous letter sent to Warby by the whistleblower in October 2018 also pointed out that a doctor who had been seen injecting himself with drugs the previous year was present during the operation. The review will examine how the trust\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Dunn, its medical director, Dr Nick Jenkins, and the board chair, Sheila Childerhouse, responded to the whistleblowing letter and the doctors\u2019 concerns that emerged. Hancock has a close relationship with Dunn and praised his leadership when he was made a CBE for services to health patient safety in 2018. The CQC said the trust\u2019s hunt for the letter writer using fingerprints and handwriting were \u201cunprecedented and concerning\u201d as it handed out its biggest-ever rating downgrade. The trust was previously forced to clarify that the request for fingerprints was not voluntary as it initially claimed, after doctors said they felt it was \u201ccoercive\u201d. A West Suffolk hospital spokeswoman said: \u201cInformation on any topic that is shared with our staff or the public is based on our understanding at the time it is asked for. In these complex cases, an independent review with maximum transparency is the right way forward, and we are in support of this approach.\u201d The terms of reference for the review state it will consider: \u201cThe appropriateness and impact of the trust seeking to identify the author of the October letter and the steps it took in doing so, including requesting relevant staff to produce fingerprinting and handwriting samples, and any advice/interactions the trust sought from other relevant bodies.\u201d The review is being conducted by Christine Outram, the chair of the Christie NHS specialist cancer hospital in Manchester, and is expected to be completed by April. It will also examine speaking up arrangements at West Suffolk hospital and how it handles \u201callegations of bullying and undermining behaviour by members of staff\u201d. CQC inspectors found that the trust\u2019s \u201cfreedom to speak up Guardian\u201d, a post designed to encourage whistleblowers, did not fully understand his role and often shared information provided in confidence with the management. The office of the national guardian for the NHS, an independent post set up to encourage whistleblowing, has already made clear it was not consulted either about the trust\u2019s tactics and did not approve. Dr Henrietta Hughes, who holds the post, said: \u201cWhen workers speak up it is crucial that organisations listen and offer support to everyone involved. The emphasis should be on investigating the matter raised rather than trying to identify the individual who is speaking up. Anonymity should be respected.\u201d The doctors\u2019 union urged medics at the hospital to give evidence to the inquiry.

      "body": "<h2><strong>PITCHFORKS FOR PICKFORD</strong></h2> <p>Jordan Pickford is a complex character, a mass of contradictions who claims to have the hide of a rhinoceros but is apparently wrapped in quite thin skin. We saw the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/everton-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">best and worst of him on Saturday</a>, the Everton goalkeeper brilliantly saving a Christian Benteke header with his chest just a few minutes after he\u2019d helped the hapless striker end his fabled drought by morphing into a near-post hologram to gift him a much-needed goal. The Crystal Palace striker\u2019s subsequent effort from point-blank range wasn\u2019t the only thing Pickford got off his chest, as he decided to unburden himself during a post-match interview in which he explained how impervious he is to criticism, while simultaneously conveying the distinct impression that it actually bothers him quite a lot. \u201cI don\u2019t let it affect me,\u201d he said, before immediately contradicting himself. \u201cBut it does piss you off.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/10/oldham-league-two-trouble-rent-north-stand\">Disputes, unpaid rent and an empty stand: Oldham lurch towards crisis | David Conn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Warming to his theme, the ambivalent Pickford suggested any criticism that comes his way is prompted by his status as an England player, rather than an England player who is enduring a conspicuous period of patchy, but hardly diabolical form. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, because everyone raves about you when you are with England, but when you go back to your club everyone wants to slate you,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cEveryone hates you, for some reason, that\u2019s part of being an England player. I think the press and everybody, the punters \u2013 look at Gary Neville \u2013 they just want to come for the England players. Everyone gets stick.\u201d</p> <p>While your nit-picking Fiver\u2019s guessing Pickford meant to say \u201cpundits\u201d rather than \u201cpunters\u201d, his decision to single out Neville suggests he has been proving to himself how much he doesn\u2019t let criticism affect him by spending five months brooding over the Sky Sports pundit\u2019s criticism of him for laughing in the immediate aftermath of another blunder that almost cost his side a goal in a game against Manchester City.</p> <p>An undeniably good goalkeeper, Pickford has endured greater torment than being sanctimoniously berated by the punditocracy, having forged his reputation as the standout player in a Sunderland side that happened to be one of the worst teams in the history of the Premier League. While the trauma of shipping three or four goals week in, week out might have proved too much of a psychological burden for some young goalkeepers, Pickford had sufficient mental fortitude to earn himself the move that would ultimately lead to his installation as England\u2019s No 1. With that in mind, it seems slightly odd that he gives two hoots what Neville, The Fiver or any other press box Johnny thinks of him at this slightly difficult time.</p> <p>As Pickford has done little wrong for England, he seems likely to remain Gareth Southgate\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper but is well aware that young pretenders Dean Henderson and Nick Pope (who is actually older than him) are snapping at his heels. \u201cDoesn\u2019t really affect me,\u201d he said, when asked about the looming presence of the Sheffield United goalkeeper in his rear view mirror. \u201cHe\u2019ll do what he\u2019ll do and I\u2019ll do what I\u2019ll do.\u201d And Southgate will do what he\u2019ll do, after wrestling with one of several tricky selection dilemmas facing him in the weeks and months ahead.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cPhilip told me quite soon after we married that he loved me very much but I was a very close second to football and I\u2019m not insulted by that in any way \u2026 we\u2019ve been married 20 years and we\u2019ve been together 23 years and he\u2019s never even made me a drink, honestly\u201d \u2013 Julie Neville explains P Nev\u2019s uncompromising devotion to the beautiful game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1afa99b7ddaebc625aa0a9f3528e724d28aeacf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1afa99b7ddaebc625aa0a9f3528e724d28aeacf9/0_8_3064_1838/1000.jpg\" alt=\"For goodness sake, Phil, get the kettle on.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For goodness sake, Phil, get the kettle on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wenn Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>FIVER LETTERS</strong></h2> <p>\u201cReading the story last week of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/police-launch-investigation-after-newcastle-fan-exposes-himself\">Newcastle fan\u2019s graphic goal celebration</a>, along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/safe-standing-across-english-football-step-closer-sports-grounds-safety-autority-report-positive\">story regarding safe standing</a>, got me thinking.

      "bodyText": "PITCHFORKS FOR PICKFORD Jordan Pickford is a complex character, a mass of contradictions who claims to have the hide of a rhinoceros but is apparently wrapped in quite thin skin. We saw the best and worst of him on Saturday, the Everton goalkeeper brilliantly saving a Christian Benteke header with his chest just a few minutes after he\u2019d helped the hapless striker end his fabled drought by morphing into a near-post hologram to gift him a much-needed goal. The Crystal Palace striker\u2019s subsequent effort from point-blank range wasn\u2019t the only thing Pickford got off his chest, as he decided to unburden himself during a post-match interview in which he explained how impervious he is to criticism, while simultaneously conveying the distinct impression that it actually bothers him quite a lot. \u201cI don\u2019t let it affect me,\u201d he said, before immediately contradicting himself. \u201cBut it does piss you off.\u201d Warming to his theme, the ambivalent Pickford suggested any criticism that comes his way is prompted by his status as an England player, rather than an England player who is enduring a conspicuous period of patchy, but hardly diabolical form. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, because everyone raves about you when you are with England, but when you go back to your club everyone wants to slate you,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cEveryone hates you, for some reason, that\u2019s part of being an England player. I think the press and everybody, the punters \u2013 look at Gary Neville \u2013 they just want to come for the England players. Everyone gets stick.\u201d While your nit-picking Fiver\u2019s guessing Pickford meant to say \u201cpundits\u201d rather than \u201cpunters\u201d, his decision to single out Neville suggests he has been proving to himself how much he doesn\u2019t let criticism affect him by spending five months brooding over the Sky Sports pundit\u2019s criticism of him for laughing in the immediate aftermath of another blunder that almost cost his side a goal in a game against Manchester City. An undeniably good goalkeeper, Pickford has endured greater torment than being sanctimoniously berated by the punditocracy, having forged his reputation as the standout player in a Sunderland side that happened to be one of the worst teams in the history of the Premier League. While the trauma of shipping three or four goals week in, week out might have proved too much of a psychological burden for some young goalkeepers, Pickford had sufficient mental fortitude to earn himself the move that would ultimately lead to his installation as England\u2019s No 1. With that in mind, it seems slightly odd that he gives two hoots what Neville, The Fiver or any other press box Johnny thinks of him at this slightly difficult time. As Pickford has done little wrong for England, he seems likely to remain Gareth Southgate\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper but is well aware that young pretenders Dean Henderson and Nick Pope (who is actually older than him) are snapping at his heels. \u201cDoesn\u2019t really affect me,\u201d he said, when asked about the looming presence of the Sheffield United goalkeeper in his rear view mirror. \u201cHe\u2019ll do what he\u2019ll do and I\u2019ll do what I\u2019ll do.\u201d And Southgate will do what he\u2019ll do, after wrestling with one of several tricky selection dilemmas facing him in the weeks and months ahead. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cPhilip told me quite soon after we married that he loved me very much but I was a very close second to football and I\u2019m not insulted by that in any way \u2026 we\u2019ve been married 20 years and we\u2019ve been together 23 years and he\u2019s never even made me a drink, honestly\u201d \u2013 Julie Neville explains P Nev\u2019s uncompromising devotion to the beautiful game. FIVER LETTERS \u201cReading the story last week of the Newcastle fan\u2019s graphic goal celebration, along with story regarding safe standing, got me thinking. Do we really want to provide English football fans with the opportunity to stand erect at games?\u201d \u2013 Stuart Robertson-Reed. \u201cFollowing on from music played at the gladiators\u2019 entrance I recall an excellent piece of music making by fans. Elland Road, 1970s, two members of Yorkshire plod walk in front of the away fans (Crystal Palace) leading to immediate rendition of Laurel and Hardy\u2019s theme tune. Cue collapse of Nasty Leeds fans in rarely seen paroxysms of good humoured laughter\u201d \u2013 Lloyd Mills. \u201cBearing in mind his anti-football philosophy/tactics and fervent self-love, perhaps Portuguese Big Sam\u2122\ufe0f would have been a better fit for the new Spurs manager\u201d \u2013 Chris Brown, USA!

      "body": "<p>Throughout her decade-long modelling career, Arizona Muse has walked catwalks for Chanel, Prada and Tom Ford, and starred in advertising campaigns for Karl Lagerfeld and Louis Vuitton. Now, however, she is starring in a new video for the climate activist group <a href=\"https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/about-us/\">Extinction Rebellion</a>, challenging viewers to \u201cshare, rewear, relove your clothing\u201d and \u201cto rebel against your clothes\u201d. Because, she says to camera, \u201cthis season\u2019s must-have is the continuation of life on Earth\u201d.</p> <p>The video, which is released today, before London fashion week, features animals on the verge of extinction, as well as ice caps melting and wildfires raging. It is the latest attempt by the fashion wing of Extinction Rebellion to challenge an industry that, as Muse puts it, \u201cis in crisis\u201d.</p> <p>Every year, global emissions from textile production <a href=\"https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/assets/downloads/publications/A-New-Textiles-Economy_Full-Report.pdf\">outweigh the carbon footprint of international flights and shipping combined, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation</a>. Between 80 and 100 billion pieces of clothing are made, with \u00a3140 million worth of clothing estimated to go into landfill in the UK alone. The fashion industry is also contributing to <a href=\"https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2019/09/12/fast-facts-about-fast-fashion/\">deforestation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/valuing-our-clothes-the-cost-of-uk-fashion_WRAP.pdf\">water scarcity</a>.</p> <p>The new video focuses on consumer responsibility, with Muse explaining: \u201cWhen we are buying clothes we are making choices about the future of the planet. We\u2019re talking about how you and I are all contributing to climate change.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B8ZPpkLFx1x/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In the early days of her sustainable fashion journey, she recalled sitting at fashion events and knowing she had \u201cmaybe one or two minutes to talk about sustainability before my seat partner would turn in the other direction\u201d. Now, she says, \u201cpeople are actually interested\u201d.</p> <p>Educating herself, via documentaries and reports from the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/about/\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>, she became \u201cfascinated by the way the whole supply chain works.\u201d Yet she is not immune to criticism for being a part of the industry that she is calling out. She has been asked previously how she feels about modelling for brands that are not sustainable. Her answer, she says, is simple: \u201cI feel so lucky that I have an access point to these brands.

For many, it seemed a radical move, but there are examples of fashion weeks revolutionising, without that kind of external pressure, in the name of climate crisis. Earlier last year the Swedish Fashion Council announced it would <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/stockholm-fashion-week-cancelled-swedish-fashion-council-sustainability-a8983906.html\">cancel Stockholm fashion week</a> to explore more sustainable options, and last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/29/make-over-copenhagen-fashion-week-announces-radical-sustainability-goals\">Copenhagen fashion week announced \u201cradical\u201d new sustainability goals</a>.

But it definitely needs some massive changes. During fashion week, there is an immense pressure on supply chains that leads to more emissions, and there is so much waste \u2013 from extravagant set designs to small things like the thousands of old coat hangers that take centuries to break down, giving off terrible toxins and endangering wildlife.

      "bodyText": "Throughout her decade-long modelling career, Arizona Muse has walked catwalks for Chanel, Prada and Tom Ford, and starred in advertising campaigns for Karl Lagerfeld and Louis Vuitton. Now, however, she is starring in a new video for the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion, challenging viewers to \u201cshare, rewear, relove your clothing\u201d and \u201cto rebel against your clothes\u201d. Because, she says to camera, \u201cthis season\u2019s must-have is the continuation of life on Earth\u201d. The video, which is released today, before London fashion week, features animals on the verge of extinction, as well as ice caps melting and wildfires raging. It is the latest attempt by the fashion wing of Extinction Rebellion to challenge an industry that, as Muse puts it, \u201cis in crisis\u201d. Every year, global emissions from textile production outweigh the carbon footprint of international flights and shipping combined, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Between 80 and 100 billion pieces of clothing are made, with \u00a3140 million worth of clothing estimated to go into landfill in the UK alone. The fashion industry is also contributing to deforestation and water scarcity. The new video focuses on consumer responsibility, with Muse explaining: \u201cWhen we are buying clothes we are making choices about the future of the planet. We\u2019re talking about how you and I are all contributing to climate change.\u201d She\u2019s keen not to make the video about shaming, however. Speaking over the phone, Muse readily admits to not having a fully sustainable wardrobe herself, and sometimes takes to Instagram to rank her outfits\u2019 green credentials. Today her jumper (regenerated cashmere), jeans (not organic) and shoes (not vegetable tan leather) score her one out of three.

      "body": "<p>There have been reports South Africa will leave Sanzaar after the 2023 World Cup to play in an expanded Six Nations tournament \u2013 but perhaps the Springboks can have the best of both worlds. The country is committed to Sanzaar until 2025, but that arrangement does not necessarily need to be a barrier to its northern ambitions. </p> <p>South Africa is uniquely placed as a southern hemisphere superpower which lies in the European timezone, which means the Springboks have the potential to play in both the Six Nations and the Rugby Championship. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/09/six-nations-what-we-learned-second-weekend\">Six Nations: what we learned from a wet and wild second weekend </a> </p> </aside>  <p>That might sound fanciful, but consider this: in the early 1990s the Lithuanian basketball team toured Australia to play a series of games against the Boomers. At the same time Lithuania played in an international tournament in Europe. How did the Lithuanians achieve this seemingly impossible task? They simply selected two different teams.</p> <p>South Africa is in a position to do likewise with the Springboks. They already have a footprint in Europe with the Cheetahs and Southern Kings \u2013 re-located from Super Rugby when the competition was reduced from 18 teams to 15 in 2018 \u2013 playing in the Guinness PRO 14. Many of South Africa\u2019s 2019 World Cup-winning Springboks are playing for English and French clubs too.</p> <p>This means South Africa possesses a pool of talent in Europe to draw on to select a competitive Springboks team to play in the Six Nations. Similarly, they would be capable of assembling another competitive Springboks team from its Super Rugby franchises to play in the Rugby Championship.</p> <p>The South Africans could field similar teams in the July and November Test windows, while a re-unified Springboks team could play at the World Cup.</p> <p>There have only been two rounds of Super Rugby this season, but indications are South Africa could put together a very good Springboks team by just selecting players from its domestic franchises. </p> <p>So far South African teams have won three of the four Super Rugby games they have played against non-South African opposition. The Stormers beat the Hurricanes 27-0 in Cape Town; the Sharks defeated the Highlanders 42-20 in Dunedin; and the Lions downed the Reds 27-20 in Johannesburg.</p> <p>This compares favourably with the efforts of the Australian teams who failed to beat any non-Australian opposition in the first two rounds. Apart from the Reds losing to the Lions, the Melbourne Rebels were upset 36-27 by the Sunwolves in Fukuoka, while the NSW Waratahs lost to the Crusaders 43-25 in Nelson and to the Blues 32-12 in Newcastle.</p> <p>It is early days, of course, but if this trend continues the consequences for Australian rugby \u2013 on and off the field \u2013 could be dire. It was only a few years ago, in the 2017 Super Rugby season, that no Australian team won any games against New Zealand opposition. The way things are looking at the moment most of the Australian teams will struggle to win any games against either New Zealand or South African sides.</p> <p>The Brumbies are the only Australian team to have won any games at all so far with both of their wins against the Reds (27-24) and Rebels (39-26) coming at the expense of fellow Australian sides. While the Brumbies are only one of four teams to remain undefeated after the first two rounds, their real test will come when they play the Highlanders in Canberra on Friday night.</p> <p>The well-drilled Brumbies may not be at the same level as the Crusaders or the Chiefs, but they should be able to compete with the other New Zealand and South African teams. If they are to do so, they will need to improve their defence, having missed 21 tackles against the Rebels.</p> <p>What about the other Australian teams? Will they beat any New Zealand or South African opposition this season? Or the Jaguares or Sunwolves for that matter? The Reds have been competitive in their two losses to the Brumbies and the Lions, they just do not seem to know how to win.</p> <p>But the Waratahs and the Rebels have been plain awful.

      "bodyText": "There have been reports South Africa will leave Sanzaar after the 2023 World Cup to play in an expanded Six Nations tournament \u2013 but perhaps the Springboks can have the best of both worlds. The country is committed to Sanzaar until 2025, but that arrangement does not necessarily need to be a barrier to its northern ambitions. South Africa is uniquely placed as a southern hemisphere superpower which lies in the European timezone, which means the Springboks have the potential to play in both the Six Nations and the Rugby Championship. That might sound fanciful, but consider this: in the early 1990s the Lithuanian basketball team toured Australia to play a series of games against the Boomers. At the same time Lithuania played in an international tournament in Europe. How did the Lithuanians achieve this seemingly impossible task? They simply selected two different teams. South Africa is in a position to do likewise with the Springboks. They already have a footprint in Europe with the Cheetahs and Southern Kings \u2013 re-located from Super Rugby when the competition was reduced from 18 teams to 15 in 2018 \u2013 playing in the Guinness PRO 14. Many of South Africa\u2019s 2019 World Cup-winning Springboks are playing for English and French clubs too. This means South Africa possesses a pool of talent in Europe to draw on to select a competitive Springboks team to play in the Six Nations. Similarly, they would be capable of assembling another competitive Springboks team from its Super Rugby franchises to play in the Rugby Championship. The South Africans could field similar teams in the July and November Test windows, while a re-unified Springboks team could play at the World Cup. There have only been two rounds of Super Rugby this season, but indications are South Africa could put together a very good Springboks team by just selecting players from its domestic franchises. So far South African teams have won three of the four Super Rugby games they have played against non-South African opposition. The Stormers beat the Hurricanes 27-0 in Cape Town; the Sharks defeated the Highlanders 42-20 in Dunedin; and the Lions downed the Reds 27-20 in Johannesburg. This compares favourably with the efforts of the Australian teams who failed to beat any non-Australian opposition in the first two rounds. Apart from the Reds losing to the Lions, the Melbourne Rebels were upset 36-27 by the Sunwolves in Fukuoka, while the NSW Waratahs lost to the Crusaders 43-25 in Nelson and to the Blues 32-12 in Newcastle. It is early days, of course, but if this trend continues the consequences for Australian rugby \u2013 on and off the field \u2013 could be dire. It was only a few years ago, in the 2017 Super Rugby season, that no Australian team won any games against New Zealand opposition. The way things are looking at the moment most of the Australian teams will struggle to win any games against either New Zealand or South African sides. The Brumbies are the only Australian team to have won any games at all so far with both of their wins against the Reds (27-24) and Rebels (39-26) coming at the expense of fellow Australian sides. While the Brumbies are only one of four teams to remain undefeated after the first two rounds, their real test will come when they play the Highlanders in Canberra on Friday night. The well-drilled Brumbies may not be at the same level as the Crusaders or the Chiefs, but they should be able to compete with the other New Zealand and South African teams. If they are to do so, they will need to improve their defence, having missed 21 tackles against the Rebels. What about the other Australian teams? Will they beat any New Zealand or South African opposition this season? Or the Jaguares or Sunwolves for that matter? The Reds have been competitive in their two losses to the Brumbies and the Lions, they just do not seem to know how to win. But the Waratahs and the Rebels have been plain awful. The Waratahs attracted their lowest ever crowd \u2013 7,491 \u2013 when they lost to a depleted Blues team which had 10 players unavailable, including All Blacks backs Beauden Barrett and Rieko Ioane. It was a wet night in Newcastle, but the Waratahs need to start winning or their long-suffering fans will continue to abandon them. Likewise, the Rebels. At least one of these under-performing teams will notch a win when they play each other in Melbourne on Friday night \u2013 unless it is a draw. South Africa may or may not join the Six Nations, but based on these early Super Rugby results they should be able to select two competitive Springboks teams, while Australia looks like it would struggle to field one decent Wallabies side.",

      "bodyText": "A donor to the Liberal National party received a $5.5m jobs and investment grant, despite potentially being ineligible because it is a registered training organisation. In April 2018 Nolan Meats was approved to receive the grant under the $200m regional jobs and investment package\u2019s business stream, despite being listed as a registered training organisation, a disqualification under the program guidelines. According to a scathing auditor general report, released in November, the program received 12 applications that were ineligible for funding, including one that was successful. The shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, said the government had \u201cfailed the test Scott Morrison set for Bridget McKenzie\u201d by funding an ineligible project. Before McKenzie\u2019s resignation over a failure to disclose membership of a shooting club that received funding, Morrison repeatedly defended her handling of the $100m community sports infrastructure grants program on the basis that no rules were broken and all projects were eligible for funding. The regional jobs and investment package\u2019s guidelines warn applicants that the infrastructure department \u201ccannot waive the eligibility criteria under any circumstances\u201d. In the Wide Bay Burnett region, where Nolan Meats received funding for its Gympie abattoir, the auditor general found \u201cnone of the eight highest applications ranked and scored the highest were awarded funding\u201d. At a parliamentary inquiry hearing on Friday, infrastructure department officials were unable to name the ineligible company and which minister had intervened on their behalf, taking both questions on notice. But the department\u2019s regional programs general manager, Donna Wieland, told the joint committee of public accounts and audit that one applicant was assessed as ineligible because it was judged to be a registered training organisation. \u201cFurther investigation found it had registered as an RTO to provide training to its staff; its main core business was not to provide training,\u201d she said. Wieland said that one of the ministers on the panel assessing the project had contacted the department expressing that the panel was \u201cinterested in funding\u201d the project anyway because training was only incidental to its business. Although the Nolan Meats grant is listed on GrantConnect as having been made on 15 December 2017, the auditor general found the ministerial panel had met to discuss Wide Bay Burnett projects on 7 February and 1 March 2018, with approval recorded on 19 April 2018. The auditor general said the ministerial panel for that region was chaired by then-regional development minister John McVeigh, who became a minister on 20 December 2017, and included small business minister Michael McCormack, Liberal MP James McGrath and former rural health, sports and regional communications minister Bridget McKenzie. King said that \u201cboth the department and audit office confirmed the ineligible company was only included because of intervention from the minister\u2019s office\u201d. \u201cMichael McCormack must explain why this company received special treatment when so many others that followed the rules missed out,\u201d she said. Nolan Meats disclosed a $3,000 donation to the Liberal National party in November 2017, one of a number of donors to receive grant funding under the regional jobs and investment program including Shoalhaven Starches, in the Manildra Group, and Teys Australia Murgon. Tony Nolan, a director of Nolan Meats, said the donation was made because \u201cwe supported the National party in the past and we continued our support\u201d, but ruled out any link to the government grant. \u201cNo, of course [that wasn\u2019t the reason].\u201d Nolan said the donation may have been prompted by a fundraising call from the local branch, but could not recall who had approached the company. He confirmed to Guardian Australia it was a registered training organisation because it trained its own staff. \u201cBeing an RTO is not our primary business but it is a critical component, to give our workers portable skills in the meat industry,\u201d Nolan said. The $5.5m Nolan Meats grant will be spent in a $10m meat-processing expansion to double production capacity from 550 to 1,100 cattle a day at its Gympie abattoir. \u201cOnce completed, this expansion will create 200 direct full-time equivalent positions which will generate a $34m yearly boost to the local economy,\u201d the program description said. The grant term is from April 2018 to December 2020. Labor has also questioned whether the project may have been ineligible because guidelines require projects to be ready to commence within 12 weeks of executing the grant agreement. Nolan Meats issued a a call for tenders due on 27 August. Nolan said the project \u201cdefinitely\u201d began within 12 weeks of receiving the grant and the main building tender was the last of about eight callouts for work on the project. \u201cPreliminary works started way back \u2013 it is not an issue.\u201d Guardian Australia has contacted McCormack and McVeigh for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Former resources minister Matt Canavan repeatedly delayed releasing documents about his interactions with coal lobbyists until he resigned his post, rendering a freedom of information request void. The case again highlights a significant flaw in Australia\u2019s FOI regime, which makes it exceedingly difficult to access documents held by a minister if they shift portfolios or resign. In November, the Australian Conservation Foundation sought access to all records of Canavan\u2019s interactions with New Hope Coal and its lobbyists in the weeks leading up to the announcement of a crackdown on the use of secondary boycotts by environmental activists. The minister identified six relevant documents but asked for more time to consult third parties. But the ACF says the deadline came and went without it receiving any response. Last week, following Canavan\u2019s resignation as minister, ACF campaigner Christian Slattery contacted the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources for an update. He was told the request was now void because Canavan no longer held the office and the documents had not been kept by his successor, Keith Pitt, meaning they were \u201cno longer in the possession of a minister\u201d. The decision has frustrated Slattery, who said the public had a clear right to know how Canavan had interacted with industry before the activist crackdown. \u201cThe public has a right to know who is lobbying our elected representatives,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIn this instance, the government has used Australia\u2019s broken FOI laws to try to hide the influence of the coal industry over our politics.\u201d The department denied suggestions that the delays constituted a breach of the FOI act. In a statement, it said it understood the ACF\u2019s FOI request was processed in a way that complied with FOI law and \u201call statutory timeframes\u201d. \u201cFollowing the resignation of Senator Canavan, the FOI applicant was advised that the FOI request could no longer be processed as the documents sought were no longer in the possession of a minister,\u201d the statement said. The matter has been referred to the office of the Australian information commissioner, which has confirmed to the ACF that it is conducting preliminary inquiries. Slattery said the government had a \u201cpoor record\u201d of hiding such information from the public. \u201cThe community has the right to expect much greater transparency from our politicians, who should be acting in the public interest, not the financial interests of big coal corporations,\u201d he said. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced plans for a crackdown on secondary boycotts during a lunch at the Queensland Resources Council in early November. Morrison described such boycotts \u2013 which attempt to erode support for companies that provide services or finance to the fossil fuel industry \u2013 as an \u201cinsidious\u201d threat to the Australian economy. \u201cTogether with the attorney general, Christian Porter, we are working to identify a series of mechanisms that can successfully outlaw these indulgent and selfish practices that threaten the livelihoods of fellow Australians, especially in our rural and regional areas and especially here in Queensland,\u201d he said at the time. Groups such as the Human Rights Law Centre and the ACF immediately condemned the proposal as undemocratic and a bid to stifle a social movement fighting for Australia to take action on climate change.",

      "bodyText": "Heavy rain in parts of regional New South Wales could have relieved immediate water security issues in as many as 20 towns, said the state\u2019s public servant charged with keeping the taps running in drought-hit regions. James McTavish, the regional town water supply coordinator, told Guardian Australia the rainfall was \u201cwonderful news\u201d for many towns, particularly along the coast. But McTavish, who was appointed to the role 12 months ago, said some towns had missed out on major falls and still faced water security problems. McTavish has been working with about 90 regional towns that had less than 12 months of water. Some had run dry and were carting water in. Others faced running out of water or serious supply problems that would have huge economic impacts. \u201cThere\u2019s probably 20 [fewer] now \u2013 maybe even a few more \u2013 but for some of those major inland centres the situation hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should have a better handle on things after this rain event and there\u2019s more due in the next week. \u201cOn the coast a lot of the water availability has certainly improved substantially. For most areas in the north coast it\u2019s a substantial change and in a very short space of time.\u201d Towns including Bellingen, Coffs Harbour, Taree, Foster and Kempsey were \u201csubstantially better off\u201d and water security was likely to return to normal. McTavish has been helping to coordinate responses in regional towns, including water carting, pipeline infrastructure, dam improvements and putting in place infrastructure for desalination plants. There had been good flows into the Hastings and Mann rivers \u201cand that\u2019s wonderful\u201d. Substantial flows on the south coast could cause water quality problems in the Brogo-Bermagui system in the Bega Valley where the Brogo Dam \u201cwill spill\u201d, he said. That catchment had also been heavily affected by bushfires, and ash and sediment could cause problems. Dams in the Shoalhaven region were \u201call filling\u201d and the Tallowa Dam was spilling. But there were many places that had missed out. Tamworth had \u201cmissed the bulk\u201d of the rain, McTavish said, and there was no substantial change to water security for Dubbo, Wellington, Cobar and Nyngan. Orange and Bathurst had also missed major falls. The Burrendong Dam \u2013 a major water source for towns such as Wellington and Dubbo and servicing about 70,000 people \u2013 also appeared to have missed out, McTavish said. But the rain had relieved some pressure and would allow plans to progress in areas that had missed out on the rain, or that could face problems in future droughts. There was good news for Collarenebri, Walgett, Brewarrina and Bourke, as there were good flows into the Barwon and Namoi rivers. \u201cThis gives us the chance to bring forward some other activities in places like Walgett and Bourke,\u201d McTavish said. \u201cWe have to make sure we don\u2019t lose sight of the longer-term picture in providing water security for these places. \u201cThe economy in many places is still on its knees.

      "body": "<p>Rebecca Front is the kind of actor who, when you see she\u2019s in something, you trust it will be good. She has had the luck \u2013 or rather talent and good judgment \u2013 to be cast in some of the best British comedies over the last 25 years. As well as roles in the pitch-black <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/13/nighty-night-box-set-review-julia-davis\">Nighty Night</a> and the cult comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/12/grandmas-house-box-set-review\">Grandma\u2019s House</a>, Front is best known as one of Armando Iannucci\u2019s regulars, appearing in The Day Today, assorted Alan Partridge series, and most notably as the inept leader of the opposition, Nicola Murray, in his Westminster satire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/dec/21/thick-of-it-tv-programme-of-2012\">The Thick of It</a>. She hadn\u2019t seen Iannucci for about a year when he sent her a text, asking if she wanted to be in his new space series, Avenue 5. She didn\u2019t know anything about the show, but this was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/30/armando-iannucci-david-copperfield-loop-death-of-stalin\">Iannucci</a>, so of course she said yes.</p> <p>When we meet at a hotel bar in central London, Front is modest and unassuming. The reason why she\u2019s wearing so much makeup, she quickly tells me, is because she\u2019s just come from a TV interview. In comedy, says Front, \u201cit helps not to have a huge amount of vanity. I think it also helps generally as you get older. Historically, it\u2019s not been great to be an actress over 50, but then I\u2019ve never really been cast because of how I look. I\u2019ve played such a range of parts, wearing wigs and loads of makeup, that I still get the feeling people don\u2019t necessarily know what I look like.\u201d</p> <p>Front often talks in qualifiers: she is pleased that TV executives in the US look at her \u201cquite differently\u201d from the people who know her work here, who perhaps only think of her as a comedy character actor. If she has a large and fragile ego, she\u2019s good at hiding it. While it\u2019s not quite right to describe Front as underrated \u2013 she won a Bafta for The Thick of It, after all \u2013 she is better known for bringing brilliance to supporting parts in other people\u2019s star vehicles. Is it never important to her to play the lead? \u201cI don\u2019t know if important is the word,\u201d she says. For her, acting is always about \u201cthe quality of the script, the quality of the people I\u2019m working with, and having an interesting part to play. I\u2019m not really too bothered where I am on the call-sheet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ea107e69bfd0dac0da3e1bead708fbee6d4fb68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ea107e69bfd0dac0da3e1bead708fbee6d4fb68/0_42_2005_1203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Front with Peter Capaldi in The Thick of It.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The world\u2019s gone too crazy to bring back Nicola\u2019 ... Front with Peter Capaldi in The Thick of It.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as a never-ceasing stream of roles, she\u2019s also published two books of funny essays and has been praised for being open \u2013 long before people talked much about mental health in public \u2013 about the anxiety she has lived with throughout her life, including claustrophobia. She is still unable to get into lifts or use the tube. Her anxiety \u201cis more under control but I think I\u2019ll always be anxious. I\u2019ve had a lot of [cognitive behavioural therapy] over the years. I\u2019ve got a therapist who, if I\u2019m really starting to stress about something, I\u2019ll just text and say, \u2018Is there any way you can fit me in this week?\u2019 I\u2019m definitely much better having found the therapy that works for me. I know the tools I can use.\u201d</p> <p>Front was seven or eight when she first got a taste for attention and the power it brought: \u201cDoing something funny, or pretending to do something and thinking, \u2018This is quite fun.\u2019\u201d She did plays at school, sang in choirs, wrote songs. \u201cI was performing every step of the way.\u201d What did she like about it? \u201cLike most actors, I\u2019m quite shy, so I liked being other people. That felt quite liberating.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Like most actors, I'm quite shy, so I liked being other people. That felt quite liberating</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And she enjoyed the craft \u2013 trying to get better, something her parents instilled in her and her brother Jeremy, a writer. Their father is an illustrator, best known for designing the Beatles\u2019 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_Soul#/media/File:Rubber_Soul.jpg\">Rubber Soul</a> album (Last year, Rebecca shared some of his work on Twitter in a post that went viral.) Their mother worked as a teacher and wrote children\u2019s books. \u201cIt was always about doing things well and not wasting your abilities,\u201d says Front. \u201cThere was never an emphasis on money \u2013 I didn\u2019t grow up with very much money, and I\u2019ve never really gone looking for the money work, although it\u2019s nice when it comes up.\u201d</p> <p>Front was at Oxford at the same time as Iannucci but they didn\u2019t know each other. However, soon after university, when she and Sioned Wiliam (now Radio 4\u2019s commissioning editor of comedy) had a double act, he was brought in to produce a BBC radio show for them. He then started working on the Radio 4 comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/audio/2008/nov/14/chris-morris-alan-partridge\">On the Hour</a> and encouraged her to join it. This would later become The Day Today when it moved to BBC Two.</p> <p>Since then, there have been more dramatic roles \u2013 as a chief superintendent in Lewis, as a cruel and ghastly mother-in-law in Poldark \u2013 but it is her work with Iannucci that has been a constant throughout her career. He has said The Thick of It could never return because politics is now post-satire. \u201cIt\u2019s all gone too crazy.

      "bodyText": "Rebecca Front is the kind of actor who, when you see she\u2019s in something, you trust it will be good. She has had the luck \u2013 or rather talent and good judgment \u2013 to be cast in some of the best British comedies over the last 25 years. As well as roles in the pitch-black Nighty Night and the cult comedy Grandma\u2019s House, Front is best known as one of Armando Iannucci\u2019s regulars, appearing in The Day Today, assorted Alan Partridge series, and most notably as the inept leader of the opposition, Nicola Murray, in his Westminster satire The Thick of It. She hadn\u2019t seen Iannucci for about a year when he sent her a text, asking if she wanted to be in his new space series, Avenue 5. She didn\u2019t know anything about the show, but this was Iannucci, so of course she said yes. When we meet at a hotel bar in central London, Front is modest and unassuming. The reason why she\u2019s wearing so much makeup, she quickly tells me, is because she\u2019s just come from a TV interview. In comedy, says Front, \u201cit helps not to have a huge amount of vanity. I think it also helps generally as you get older. Historically, it\u2019s not been great to be an actress over 50, but then I\u2019ve never really been cast because of how I look. I\u2019ve played such a range of parts, wearing wigs and loads of makeup, that I still get the feeling people don\u2019t necessarily know what I look like.\u201d Front often talks in qualifiers: she is pleased that TV executives in the US look at her \u201cquite differently\u201d from the people who know her work here, who perhaps only think of her as a comedy character actor. If she has a large and fragile ego, she\u2019s good at hiding it. While it\u2019s not quite right to describe Front as underrated \u2013 she won a Bafta for The Thick of It, after all \u2013 she is better known for bringing brilliance to supporting parts in other people\u2019s star vehicles. Is it never important to her to play the lead? \u201cI don\u2019t know if important is the word,\u201d she says. For her, acting is always about \u201cthe quality of the script, the quality of the people I\u2019m working with, and having an interesting part to play. I\u2019m not really too bothered where I am on the call-sheet.\u201d As well as a never-ceasing stream of roles, she\u2019s also published two books of funny essays and has been praised for being open \u2013 long before people talked much about mental health in public \u2013 about the anxiety she has lived with throughout her life, including claustrophobia. She is still unable to get into lifts or use the tube. Her anxiety \u201cis more under control but I think I\u2019ll always be anxious. I\u2019ve had a lot of [cognitive behavioural therapy] over the years. I\u2019ve got a therapist who, if I\u2019m really starting to stress about something, I\u2019ll just text and say, \u2018Is there any way you can fit me in this week?\u2019 I\u2019m definitely much better having found the therapy that works for me. I know the tools I can use.\u201d Front was seven or eight when she first got a taste for attention and the power it brought: \u201cDoing something funny, or pretending to do something and thinking, \u2018This is quite fun.\u2019\u201d She did plays at school, sang in choirs, wrote songs. \u201cI was performing every step of the way.\u201d What did she like about it? \u201cLike most actors, I\u2019m quite shy, so I liked being other people. That felt quite liberating.\u201d And she enjoyed the craft \u2013 trying to get better, something her parents instilled in her and her brother Jeremy, a writer. Their father is an illustrator, best known for designing the Beatles\u2019 Rubber Soul album (Last year, Rebecca shared some of his work on Twitter in a post that went viral.) Their mother worked as a teacher and wrote children\u2019s books. \u201cIt was always about doing things well and not wasting your abilities,\u201d says Front. \u201cThere was never an emphasis on money \u2013 I didn\u2019t grow up with very much money, and I\u2019ve never really gone looking for the money work, although it\u2019s nice when it comes up.\u201d Front was at Oxford at the same time as Iannucci but they didn\u2019t know each other. However, soon after university, when she and Sioned Wiliam (now Radio 4\u2019s commissioning editor of comedy) had a double act, he was brought in to produce a BBC radio show for them. He then started working on the Radio 4 comedy On the Hour and encouraged her to join it. This would later become The Day Today when it moved to BBC Two. Since then, there have been more dramatic roles \u2013 as a chief superintendent in Lewis, as a cruel and ghastly mother-in-law in Poldark \u2013 but it is her work with Iannucci that has been a constant throughout her career. He has said The Thick of It could never return because politics is now post-satire. \u201cIt\u2019s all gone too crazy. It\u2019s a shame because I would be more than happy to revisit Nicola,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cOccasionally, I entertain myself by wondering what she\u2019s doing.\u201d Working for some think-tank, she reckons, and earning lots of money. Because of that role, people like to talk to her about party politics, though she\u2019s always been reluctant. Front, who is Jewish, neatly and politely swerves when I ask how she feels about Labour\u2019s recent implosion over antisemitism, though she says that its rise in general \u201cbreaks my heart. It had never really gone away but I\u2019d hoped we were moving into a zone where, even if people didn\u2019t like minorities, they wouldn\u2019t actually feel they could say it out loud. It\u2019s not just antisemitism, it\u2019s racism generally. That depresses the hell out of me.\u201d Set some 40 years in the future \u2013 on a space cruise that has been catastrophically knocked off course \u2013 Avenue 5 sees Front playing Karen Kelly, a demanding, no-nonsense American who becomes the go-between for the passengers and crew. She is based partly on Front\u2019s husband of 30 years, Phil, a former executive producer, who she describes as hugely competent and assertive \u2013 \u201cthe man you want to be next to if your flight gets cancelled\u201d. She says this with the awed look of someone who doesn\u2019t know how to make a fuss. Karen is also based on an American woman she once met in the queue for the loos in a smart department store, who suddenly demanded of Front \u2013 without making eye contact \u2013 directions to Trafalgar Square. \u201cShe\u2019s that woman, which is why a lot of the time Karen will preface her sentences with \u2018OK, so \u2026\u2019\u201d Karen wasn\u2019t always going to be American but the accent \u201cgives me an extra level of confidence. American accents often sound much more confident than British ones.\u201d The show is only two episodes in when we meet and reviews have been mixed. She isn\u2019t surprised. \u201cI think people want it to be Veep [Iannucci\u2019s US politics satire]. It\u2019s still satire and it\u2019s still satirising similar targets. The Thick of It and Veep were not exclusively about politics \u2013 they were about human nature and selfishness, venality and power. And that\u2019s exactly what Avenue 5 is about.

He criticized the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and former mayor Pete Buttigieg, who both claimed victory in Iowa and are <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-6276.html\">running far ahead</a> of him in the New Hampshire polls. This, at last, was the Biden his campaign talks about; the great campaigner, the king of the soapbox, coming out swinging.</p> \n<p>It didn\u2019t last long \u2013 moments later, Biden was struggling to remember the name of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that he had touted as a key achievement of his time in office with Barack Obama \u2013 but at least it gave his supporters something to cling to.</p> \n<p>They needed it, because bright spots have been few and far between for Biden of late. After the catastrophic performance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/04/iowa-caucuses-results-what-we-know-so-far\">in Iowa</a>, where he finished a distant fourth, Biden is polling <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-6276.html\">fifth</a> in New Hampshire, too, unthinkable for someone who spent most of 2019 in the lead.</p> \n<p>Perhaps it has, at last, jolted Biden into action. On Saturday, once he moved past the nuclear deal \u2013 the proper title is the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \u2013 the former vice-president was back in his stride. After railing against Trump, he invoked his personal story.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve lost a lot in my lifetime, like many of you have,\u201d Biden told the crowd.</p> \n<p>\u201cA car accident took away my wife and daughter. Lost my son, Beau, like many of you have done. But I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to stand by and lose my country, too.\u201d</p> \n<p>The last line was delivered with a growl, and brought a roar of applause. This is a new part of Biden\u2019s patter, and it went down so well that he used it again \u2013 and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1226677160103960576\">tweeted it</a> \u2013 later that day.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d053d47d3aedb99a367ad5ff91961ecefdd8d3bf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d053d47d3aedb99a367ad5ff91961ecefdd8d3bf/0_0_3280_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden shakes hands as he arrives to talk to voters in Hampton, New Hampshire, on 9 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden shakes hands as he arrives to talk to voters in Hampton, New Hampshire, on Sunday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For all the criticism of Biden personally, his lackluster performances don\u2019t stand in isolation. There are things about his campaign, too, that just don\u2019t quite work.</p> \n<p>His slogan here, \u201cBiden: works for New Hampshire\u201d, scans as a shrug-of-the-shoulders acceptance, while on Biden\u2019s yard signs the New Hampshire outline has been rendered in such a way that it looks like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=joe+biden+campaign+sign+new+hampshire&amp;tbm=isch&amp;safe=off&amp;safe=off&amp;hl=en&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjhncTJjcbnAhVYA98KHW9QCQMQgowBegQIARAV&amp;biw=716&amp;bih=699#imgrc=Uiw8mh8vjSP9uM\">a raised middle finger</a>.

In Iowa, where Biden struggled to turn out large crowds to his rallies, a campaign surrogate <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-bidens-campaign-has-a-problem-and-it-begins-with-the-candidate/2020/02/06/7493855c-4904-11ea-9164-d3154ad8a5cd_story.html\">reassured the Washington Post</a> ahead of the caucuses that people know Biden \u2013 they don\u2019t need to come to events.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"02cb4094-b1e8-4b69-87fd-d857cef8f48f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and outlying territories, by which each party selects its presidential nominee.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The goal for presidential candidates is to amass a majority of delegates, whose job it is to choose the nominee at the party\u2019s national convention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/12/us-election-2020-simple-guide-electoral-college-primaries\">later in the year</a>.

      "bodyText": "There was a moment about five minutes into Joe Biden\u2019s rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, that jolted members of the crowd up in their seats. The former vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate, who has spent the past few months turning in soporific performances both on the debate stage and at his campaign events, became animated. Donald Trump was ruining America, Biden shouted into the microphone at the event on Saturday. He criticized the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and former mayor Pete Buttigieg, who both claimed victory in Iowa and are running far ahead of him in the New Hampshire polls. This, at last, was the Biden his campaign talks about; the great campaigner, the king of the soapbox, coming out swinging. It didn\u2019t last long \u2013 moments later, Biden was struggling to remember the name of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that he had touted as a key achievement of his time in office with Barack Obama \u2013 but at least it gave his supporters something to cling to. They needed it, because bright spots have been few and far between for Biden of late. After the catastrophic performance in Iowa, where he finished a distant fourth, Biden is polling fifth in New Hampshire, too, unthinkable for someone who spent most of 2019 in the lead. Perhaps it has, at last, jolted Biden into action. On Saturday, once he moved past the nuclear deal \u2013 the proper title is the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \u2013 the former vice-president was back in his stride. After railing against Trump, he invoked his personal story. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve lost a lot in my lifetime, like many of you have,\u201d Biden told the crowd. \u201cA car accident took away my wife and daughter. Lost my son, Beau, like many of you have done. But I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to stand by and lose my country, too.\u201d The last line was delivered with a growl, and brought a roar of applause. This is a new part of Biden\u2019s patter, and it went down so well that he used it again \u2013 and tweeted it \u2013 later that day. For all the criticism of Biden personally, his lackluster performances don\u2019t stand in isolation. There are things about his campaign, too, that just don\u2019t quite work. His slogan here, \u201cBiden: works for New Hampshire\u201d, scans as a shrug-of-the-shoulders acceptance, while on Biden\u2019s yard signs the New Hampshire outline has been rendered in such a way that it looks like a raised middle finger. At events his staff display cardboard cutouts of Ray Ban-style sunglasses, in blue and red, a fun reference to Biden\u2019s penchant for summer spectacles, but one that really had its day as a popular source of amusement back in 2014. While the optics are awkward, there are signs, too, that the campaign has been guilty of resting on its laurels. In Iowa, where Biden struggled to turn out large crowds to his rallies, a campaign surrogate reassured the Washington Post ahead of the caucuses that people know Biden \u2013 they don\u2019t need to come to events. That analysis was wrong, clearly, and illustrated a gap in excitement between Biden\u2019s supporters and those of his rivals \u2013 a gap which was on display on Saturday night, when Biden appeared with eight of the other candidates at the McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club dinner in downtown Manchester. The dinner is a litmus rest of enthusiasm in the Democratic party, and thousands of people had packed into the arena. Candidates\u2019 supporters are assigned different sections of the arena, and Buttigieg\u2019s crowd was the most visible, hundreds of yellow-clad acolytes sprawled across the far end of the arena, waving handed-out clackers and chanting: \u201cPresident Pete.\u201d The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s supporters, wearing light green, waving glowsticks and dancing to the Village People\u2019s YMCA, occupied a broad swathe behind the speaker\u2019s podium, next to a smaller but vocal mass of Sanders advocates, many waving neon pink \u201cBernie\u201d signs. Biden, by contrast, had lured out a tiny sliver of support. About 100 Bidenites were sitting in a little slice of the arena, boxed in on either side by Warren fans. Some of them had T-shirts, and several of them were holding signs that collectively spelt out \u201cBiden 2020\u201d, but as Biden, blood pumping with newfound vigor, jogged on to the stage, he would have struggled to pick them out. \u201cWe\u2019re being led by a president, a president, who actually has no empathy, no sympathy, who mocks people, who makes fun of people with disabilities, who does everything he can to demean. He doesn\u2019t have a shred of decency in him,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m gonna stand by and lose this election to this man.\u201d Biden\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 it might have been a good idea for him to take his hand out of his pocket, for one thing \u2013 but for those supporters who showed up it will have proved a nice fillip. The next morning, however, as Biden returned to action at a plush hotel in the seaside town of Hampton there were signs that he is still getting used to his new tub-thumping role. Biden spent the first 10 minutes wandering slowly about the stage, reminiscing about interactions he had with political figures in the 1970s, before new Biden took over, raising his voice and laying into Trump.

He first ran for president in 1987, and at 77 years old, after five decades in public office, he has visibly slowed. There is a video on C-Span, the non-profit which televises the process of US government, of Biden campaigning in 1987, during his run for president. His hairline \u2013 improbably \u2013 and bright smile are the same, but as a public speaker he is unrecognisable. The younger Biden speaks clearly and confidently, with a quicker cadence. He seems to be enjoying himself. This is the Biden people think of when they talk about him as a great campaigner, and this week, in New Hampshire, crowds have seen a version of Biden that feels far closer to the 87 version than what his supporters witnessed in Iowa.

Infamously, one such event, in California, was held in a posh wine cave. \u201cFor two people in the same party, Buttigieg and Bernie are polar opposites in many ways,\u201d said Monica Klein, a progressive Democratic strategist. \u201cThey represent the two wings of the Democratic party \u2013 which makes Buttigieg a great contrast candidate for Bernie.\u201d In the last debate, on Friday in New Hampshire, Buttigieg and Sanders spent more time knocking other candidates, like Klobuchar or former vice-president Joe Biden, than each other. Democrats expect that to change. In campaign stump speeches, the references to each other are there. \u201cThis election is so vitally important because we need a true champion of the people in the White House who doesn\u2019t kowtow to high money interest, that does not hold fundraisers in wine caves with Swarovski crystals,\u201d the former Ohio state senator Nina Turner, one of Sanders\u2019 campaign co-chairs, said at a rally in Claremont on Sunday. Sanders has repeatedly bashed Buttigieg for how he raises money. At a recent event in Plymouth, he said \u201cour views are different. Pete has raised campaign contributions from over 40 billionaires.\u201d In Manchester on Monday, speaking pointedly, he said he did not \u201ctake money from the CEOs of pharmaceutical companies or from Wall Street goons \u2026 we don\u2019t want their money, we don\u2019t need them.\u201d Buttigieg has been slightly more opaque but his references to Sanders are still direct enough. And as he has toured New Hampshire, he has added a new line to his speech. \u201cI talk to a lot of people who tell me if their only choices are between a revolution and a status quo,\u201d he said in Lebanon, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t leave a lot of room for them.\u201d It was a clear references to calls by Sanders and his supporters for a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d. Buttigieg has also warned about the cost of Sanders\u2019 plan for Medicare for All. \u201cWhat we could do without is a plan so expensive that Senator Sanders himself freely admits he has no idea how it\u2019s supposed to be paid for,\u201d he said recently in Dover. To supporters, the rivalry is visible. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of tension now between Pete supporters and Bernie supporters and Biden supporters,\u201d said Colby Conner, a 20-year-old Dartmouth College student who went to see Buttigieg in Hanover on Saturday. After Sanders\u2019 Sunday rally, Lisa Matthews, from Lebanon, said her big priority was picking a candidate who could beat Trump. That seemed more like Sanders, she said. \u201cI feel like Bernie can get the young vote and young people don\u2019t like Pete so much, from what I hear,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cI think Bernie can get the black vote and I\u2019m worried that [Pete] has absolutely no visibility in the black community. \u201cSo I think Bernie, overall, once we get farther along in the campaign, will do better than Pete.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 February 2020 to correct the age of Bernie Sanders from 79 to 78.",

It was six o\u2019clock on Saturday 8 February and Getafe\u2019s manager reckoned they had reached their target. \u201cNot mathematically,\u201d he conceded, sitting there at the Coliseum where another team had been thrown to the lions, \u201cbut virtually.\u201d Outside, 13,070 supporters had spent the afternoon serenading him, singing \u201cBordal\u00e1s, I love you\u201d as Getafe beat Valencia, the club whose centre forward cost twice as much as their entire starting XI. And no wonder: two goals from Jorge Molina and one from Jaime Mata took them to 42 points, securing another season in <em>primera</em> for the team he took over in the relegation zone, second bottom.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/04/jose-bordalas-brings-life-to-getafe-as-intense-approach-reaps-rewards\">Of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/04/jose-bordalas-brings-life-to-getafe-as-intense-approach-reaps-rewards\">segunda</a></em>.</p> \n<p>Up from the second, into the first, staying there twice and safe again with 15 matches still to go, time for some other target then. They won\u2019t say so, not publicly at least, but it\u2019s not just the league Getafe aspire to be in next season; it\u2019s the Champions League too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/25/getafe-inch-closer-to-making-the-unbelievable-dream-a-reality\">And while they have been here before</a> \u2013 last year, they missed out on the final day, 22 minutes of which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/20/valencia-make-a-mockery-of-reason-by-sealing-champions-league-place\">they spent in fourth</a> \u2013 this time they\u2019re even better placed than before. More importantly, it\u2019s still absurd. Just doing what they did to Valencia is pretty silly.</p> \n<p>Valencia-Getafe is a very modern rivalry and a startlingly bitter one too, built on recriminations, emerging swiftly and embraced deeply. There has been fighting talk and actual fighting. Last season\u2019s Copa del Rey tie, won in the last minute by Valencia, turned into full-on battle where there genuinely was blood, sweat and tears, and when Getafe lost that last Champions League place <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/25/getafe-inch-closer-to-making-the-unbelievable-dream-a-reality\">it was to Valencia</a>. Yet Bordal\u00e1s insisted that didn\u2019t make Saturday\u2019s win taste better \u2013 although for the fans it probably did \u2013 and nor is that why Valencia manager Albert Celades referred to Getafe as \u201cdirect rivals\u201d. Instead, it was because this was third against fifth, two points apart, making it a match of huge significance. \u201cWe\u2019re competing for the same thing,\u201d Celades said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It finished 3-0. It could have been four, five, six or more. 'Bish, bash, bosh' read the headline in AS</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>They shouldn\u2019t be. Valencia\u2019s salary cap, set by the league (the total amount they are allowed to spend on their playing staff, transfers and wages included), is \u20ac170m. Getafe\u2019s is \u20ac56m. Eleven teams have a bigger budget; Barcelona and Madrid\u2019s annual revenue is <em>16</em> times theirs. The 14 men who played on Saturday cost \u20ac16.2m. Maxi L\u00f3pez cost \u20ac30m. So did Rodrigo Moreno. Getafe\u2019s most expensive player is Nemanja Maksimovic, who Valencia didn\u2019t want. In the winter window they lost their first-choice centre-back to bottom-placed Espanyol, for goodness sake.</p> \n<p>\u201cI tell my players that they should believe, that they should set their own limits, not let anyone else do that for them; I try to get them to see that they have talent, that they can do it, tell them that players at big clubs are no better than them,\u201d Bordal\u00e1s said. But they\u2019re supposed to be.</p> \n<p>Getafe\u2019s real, original rivalry is with Legan\u00e9s, built on gravel pitches <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/11/clasico-leganes-getafe-la-liga-spanish-football\">in regional football to the south of Madrid</a> and somehow established in <em>primera</em>. Coming up to 38, officially the captain is <em>older than the club he plays for</em>: when Molina signed, at 34, seemingly on the way down, he thought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/21/jorge-molina-road-to-verge-europe-getafe-la-liga\">he\u2019d never reach the first division again</a>. His strike partner, Mata, scoring goals as a student but never really seeing this as a career, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/apr/26/yes-getafe-really-might-be-on-their-way-to-the-champions-league\">didn\u2019t think he would ever get there at all</a>. The other striker, \u00c1ngel, was 30 when he signed, unexpectedly getting the chance to go back. The year before Dami\u00e1n Su\u00e1rez joined, he was relegated with Elche and in his first year at Getafe was relegated again. When Xabi Exteita signed this summer, it was from relegation with Huesca. Allan Nyom had just gone down with West Brom. And on it goes: 28 relegations the squad have endured between them.</p> \n<p>And yet on Saturday \u2013 on any given Sunday, in fact \u2013 Bordal\u00e1s was right. They are no worse than players at bigger clubs. In fact, they are better. In the case of Valencia, miles better. At the end of Saturday\u2019s game, standing at the touchline having been beaten, it took Valencia defender Gabriel five or six seconds to say anything, the silence deafening, a lost look in his eyes, like a broken man. \u201cI can\u2019t say anything \u2026\u201d he eventually mumbled, trying to bite his tongue. When at last he did, he said: \u201cIt was shit, all of it. Everything was shit.\u201d Which was true, but that\u2019s what Getafe do to a lot of teams.</p> \n<p>Besides, if everything Valencia did was shit, everything Getafe did was brilliant. They didn\u2019t just defeat Valencia, they took them to pieces; in doing so, they took the cliches to pieces too.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"695c0eb118521c25c307f04d911ac0648694dea4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/695c0eb118521c25c307f04d911ac0648694dea4/0_0_4836_3224/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jos\u00e9 Bordal\u00e1s\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Getafe manager Jos\u00e9 Bordal\u00e1s, right, has taken his side from the second division to a position above Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Sevilla in the top flight.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quality Sport Images/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It finished 3-0. It could have been four, five, six or more. \u201cBish, bash, bosh\u201d read the headline in AS, which summed it up quite nicely, Valencia beaten to a pulp, except it was more subtle than that. \u201cBoring,\u201d \u201cdirty,\u201d defensive Getafe, the \u201canti-football\u201d team who actually spend more time in the opposition half than anyone else in Spain, had 22 shots. They had 10 on target and nine corners. Valencia didn\u2019t have any of either. They had more of the ball, more passes, more crosses, more dribbles, more everything except fouls. They\u2019re tough it\u2019s true, and at times maybe it isn\u2019t easy on the eye, skilled at the \u201cother football\u201d, but they can play, like Bordal\u00e1s says. Last week at Athletic, Dami\u00e1n Su\u00e1rez turned all Leo Messi. This week, Molina turned all Denis Bergkamp. Turned all the Valencia defence too, leaving them in a cartoon knot, knees facing backwards, legs wrapped round each other.</p> \n<p>Molina\u2019s second goal was superb, \u201ca work of art\u201d Bordal\u00e1s said, a mess of Valencia defenders sent out for cigarettes: a shift one way, yoo-hoo, bye, a shift the other, and it was in the net. But it wasn\u2019t about that; it was about everything. It was that while the first dropped to him from a rebound, he had made the opportunity in the first place, the third he had made in five minutes; that while it might have been a potty-mouthed <em>guiri</em>, or foreigner, who called him \u201cso fucking good\u201d on the radio, far from reproach the line, the presenter repeated it. Molina stops the clock, master of time and space, magically appearing around him. Hold, wait, apply the pause and then the pass, something from nothing. There is no better slow-motion dribbler, defenders lulled then defeated, so smooth, almost silent, no better way out.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s like El Cid, everyone follows him,\u201d Bordal\u00e1s said, making Molina blush. \u201cThe feeling is reciprocated,\u201d Molina said, smiling softly. Everything is and it is all of them. Just look at the forwards: Molina has been wonderful; Mata got a Spain call-up; this week, the talk in Getafe was that Barcelona were coming for \u00c1ngel. Cucurella, Arambarri, Maksimovic, Djen\u00e9, Soria and stop there \u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be fair to keep going and leave anyone out.</p> \n<p>Bordal\u00e1s certainly won\u2019t. He was quick to highlight \u00c1ngel\u2019s role in the third. Getafe\u2019s top scorer on nine goals, eight of them off the bench, \u00c1ngel had the chance to get another but instead rolled it across for Mata to score. There was something in that, a portrait of his team, just as there was something in the fact that most of his players actually ran the other way to celebrate with Kenedy \u2013 another substitute and the man whose tackle, not exactly the thing he is known for, had started it all off. \u201cThis team is super-generous; I appreciate the work, the attitude, the solidarity. We\u2019re a family. This team is an example of generosity, an example of football,\u201d Bordal\u00e1s said.</p> \n<p>It is his example, his obsession. When Bordal\u00e1s arrived just over three years ago, Getafe were near the foot of the second division. He took them to promotion, then to eighth, then fifth. Now, they\u2019re safe again with 15 weeks to go. Intense, demanding, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/04/jose-bordalas-brings-life-to-getafe-as-intense-approach-reaps-rewards\">a little mad</a> but with method, once seen as unsuited to the first division, too unsubtle for the top flight, what he has done is extraordinary. He has revived them all, moulding what might seem to be a motley crew into a hugely impressive football team, achieving beyond their wildest dreams.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9fa94c4683c0eae8a959cc1856daef61fd1556e5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fa94c4683c0eae8a959cc1856daef61fd1556e5/0_132_3755_2254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Getafe CF\u2019s Jaime Mata scores the third goal after some fine work from \u00c1ngel in the buildup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Getafe CF\u2019s Jaime Mata scores the third goal after some fine work from \u00c1ngel in the buildup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rodrigo Jimenez/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Between them, his players have played more seasons in the second division than first and have experienced more relegations than they have winners\u2019 medals, three times as many as they have league titles \u2013 and none of those are in Europe\u2019s five biggest leagues. Only two of them are even in Europe, in fact: there\u2019s an <em>apertura</em> and a <em>clausura</em> with River Plate, a Cameroonian title with Cotton Sport, two leagues with Dynamo Kyiv, two in Kazakhstan and that\u2019s that. Yet here they are, third: ahead of Atl\u00e9tico and Sevilla, now five points and an unassailable head-to-head record ahead of Valencia, their 21st century rivals for whom, like most first division teams, they should be no match</p> \n<p>Saturday\u2019s starting XI has played just seven Champions League games ever, but that could change. As Molina put it: \u201cit\u2019s not chance.\u201d If they might not be the third best team in Spain right now, it might only be because they\u2019re the second. They have won four in a row without conceding a goal and although Barcelona and Sevilla are up next, plus Ajax in the Europa League, although there is a long way to go, safety has been secured for another season, leaving something greater before them. It will be hard, but if Getafe are anything it is hard, built to do what they can\u2019t.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about that, day to day,\u201d Bordal\u00e1s said. \u201cBut you always dream, grow, improve, try to achieve big things. Today we played a team with a budget that is far, far greater than our own and we won with authority. I tell them: let\u2019s enjoy this, keep working, because as soon as you stop, it ends, and see what happens next. There\u2019s a very long way to go. We\u2019re on a crossing, swimming. We\u2019ve passed the equator and we can see the beach now. Don\u2019t give up yet; keep on swimming until you reach the shore.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7e87a592-d232-4357-909c-a2c975aea840\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Alav\u00e9s 2\u20131 Eibar, Levante 2\u20130 Legan\u00e9s, Getafe 3\u20130 Valencia, Valladolid 1\u20131 Villarreal, Atl\u00e9tico 1\u20130 Granada, Espanyol 1\u20130 Mallorca, Real Sociedad 2\u20131 Athletic, Osasuna 1\u20134 Madrid, Celta 2\u20131 Sevilla, Betis 2\u20133 Barcelona</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

It could have been four, five, six or more. \u201cBish, bash, bosh\u201d read the headline in AS, which summed it up quite nicely, Valencia beaten to a pulp, except it was more subtle than that. \u201cBoring,\u201d \u201cdirty,\u201d defensive Getafe, the \u201canti-football\u201d team who actually spend more time in the opposition half than anyone else in Spain, had 22 shots. They had 10 on target and nine corners. Valencia didn\u2019t have any of either. They had more of the ball, more passes, more crosses, more dribbles, more everything except fouls. They\u2019re tough it\u2019s true, and at times maybe it isn\u2019t easy on the eye, skilled at the \u201cother football\u201d, but they can play, like Bordal\u00e1s says. Last week at Athletic, Dami\u00e1n Su\u00e1rez turned all Leo Messi. This week, Molina turned all Denis Bergkamp. Turned all the Valencia defence too, leaving them in a cartoon knot, knees facing backwards, legs wrapped round each other. Molina\u2019s second goal was superb, \u201ca work of art\u201d Bordal\u00e1s said, a mess of Valencia defenders sent out for cigarettes: a shift one way, yoo-hoo, bye, a shift the other, and it was in the net. But it wasn\u2019t about that; it was about everything. It was that while the first dropped to him from a rebound, he had made the opportunity in the first place, the third he had made in five minutes; that while it might have been a potty-mouthed guiri, or foreigner, who called him \u201cso fucking good\u201d on the radio, far from reproach the line, the presenter repeated it. Molina stops the clock, master of time and space, magically appearing around him. Hold, wait, apply the pause and then the pass, something from nothing. There is no better slow-motion dribbler, defenders lulled then defeated, so smooth, almost silent, no better way out. \u201cHe\u2019s like El Cid, everyone follows him,\u201d Bordal\u00e1s said, making Molina blush. \u201cThe feeling is reciprocated,\u201d Molina said, smiling softly. Everything is and it is all of them. Just look at the forwards: Molina has been wonderful; Mata got a Spain call-up; this week, the talk in Getafe was that Barcelona were coming for \u00c1ngel. Cucurella, Arambarri, Maksimovic, Djen\u00e9, Soria and stop there \u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be fair to keep going and leave anyone out. Bordal\u00e1s certainly won\u2019t. He was quick to highlight \u00c1ngel\u2019s role in the third. Getafe\u2019s top scorer on nine goals, eight of them off the bench, \u00c1ngel had the chance to get another but instead rolled it across for Mata to score. There was something in that, a portrait of his team, just as there was something in the fact that most of his players actually ran the other way to celebrate with Kenedy \u2013 another substitute and the man whose tackle, not exactly the thing he is known for, had started it all off. \u201cThis team is super-generous; I appreciate the work, the attitude, the solidarity. We\u2019re a family. This team is an example of generosity, an example of football,\u201d Bordal\u00e1s said. It is his example, his obsession. When Bordal\u00e1s arrived just over three years ago, Getafe were near the foot of the second division. He took them to promotion, then to eighth, then fifth. Now, they\u2019re safe again with 15 weeks to go. Intense, demanding, a little mad but with method, once seen as unsuited to the first division, too unsubtle for the top flight, what he has done is extraordinary. He has revived them all, moulding what might seem to be a motley crew into a hugely impressive football team, achieving beyond their wildest dreams. Between them, his players have played more seasons in the second division than first and have experienced more relegations than they have winners\u2019 medals, three times as many as they have league titles \u2013 and none of those are in Europe\u2019s five biggest leagues. Only two of them are even in Europe, in fact: there\u2019s an apertura and a clausura with River Plate, a Cameroonian title with Cotton Sport, two leagues with Dynamo Kyiv, two in Kazakhstan and that\u2019s that. Yet here they are, third: ahead of Atl\u00e9tico and Sevilla, now five points and an unassailable head-to-head record ahead of Valencia, their 21st century rivals for whom, like most first division teams, they should be no match Saturday\u2019s starting XI has played just seven Champions League games ever, but that could change. As Molina put it: \u201cit\u2019s not chance.\u201d If they might not be the third best team in Spain right now, it might only be because they\u2019re the second. They have won four in a row without conceding a goal and although Barcelona and Sevilla are up next, plus Ajax in the Europa League, although there is a long way to go, safety has been secured for another season, leaving something greater before them. It will be hard, but if Getafe are anything it is hard, built to do what they can\u2019t. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about that, day to day,\u201d Bordal\u00e1s said. \u201cBut you always dream, grow, improve, try to achieve big things. Today we played a team with a budget that is far, far greater than our own and we won with authority. I tell them: let\u2019s enjoy this, keep working, because as soon as you stop, it ends, and see what happens next. There\u2019s a very long way to go. We\u2019re on a crossing, swimming. We\u2019ve passed the equator and we can see the beach now. Don\u2019t give up yet; keep on swimming until you reach the shore.\u201d",

I don\u2019t know about you, but there is nothing I enjoy more than hearing about the half-hearted eco efforts of the 0.0001%. There have been press releases about \u201cplant-based\u201d meals at the event and doomy warnings about the negative environmental impact of sequins. If you think finger-wagging about sequins while your guests take private jets to the beach house and helicopters to music festivals is the literalisation of fiddling while Rome burns, well, that\u2019s ridiculous. Unlike a sequin, no one would put a fiddle on a dress, because it\u2019s just not very slimming.</p> <p>Most of all, there were promises that (some of) the guests would (maybe) re-wear an outfit, as opposed to getting a new one for the ceremony. This is the celebrity equivalent of going off-grid and, last month, Stella McCartney posted a deeply excited tweet in which she praised Joaquin Phoenix for \u201cmaking choices for the future of the planet\u201d, this particular choice being \u201cto wear this same tux for the entire award season\u201d. That the much-worn tux just happened to be by one Stella McCartney is surely a coincidence, and I have no doubt that McCartney would have been just as happy if Phoenix had decided to clothe his body solely in Gucci, Pucci, or Fiorucci. If you save a tree in the forest, but don\u2019t send out a press release about it, did you save it at all?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/parasite-first-foreign-language-film-to-win-best-picture-oscar\">Parasite makes Oscars history as first foreign language winner of best picture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Phoenix wasn\u2019t the only one re-wearing an outfit to the Oscars. When I covered the event last year, I was five months pregnant, so wore a maternity party dress. Well, the baby was born, but as one of my older kids asked recently: \u201cIf you\u2019re not pregnant any more, why is your tummy still big?\u201d (Oh, I laughed at that one, all the way to the lawyer\u2019s office, where I disinherited the adorable little tyke.) So it was back in the maternity party dress for me, because I can\u2019t be faffed to do any exercise \u2026 I mean, because I care passionately about the environment. Who is the hero now, Joaquin?</p> <p>Yet when I arrived at the theatre on Sunday afternoon, I struggled to find any celebrities re-wearing their clothes. Well, to be honest, I struggled to find any celebrities, full stop. In previous years, everyone \u2013 celebrities and peasants alike \u2013 walked down the red carpet together, but this year, only the A-listers were granted that privilege, with the rest of us shunted off to the gutter, hidden behind a white screen, thus sparing TV watchers at home from seeing our hideous zombie faces. It felt \u2013 and yes, you might have seen this Parasite analogy coming \u2013 like being stuck in the basement, watching the rich and the beautiful frolic in the sunshine above us.</p> <p>\u201cMy progress in was remarkably smooth \u2013 it always looked like chaos on TV, but the red carpet was fine,\u201d the nominee Jonathan Pryce told me in the theatre\u2019s atrium. \u201cBut then maybe I got the VIP fast-track treatment,\u201d he concluded, correctly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"562cbd4a492e31f7cad71f40533dd630c7b995e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/562cbd4a492e31f7cad71f40533dd630c7b995e7/0_240_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cynthia Erivo performing at the Oscars ceremony.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cynthia Erivo performing at the Oscars ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Sjodin/ABC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there was the ceremony, and it looked initially as if we were in for three hours of the Oscars arguing with, er, the Oscars. Oscars v Oscars: at last, Hollywood has found a movie that sounds even less enticing than Suicide Squad. Presenter after presenter ragged on the ceremony for its lack of diversity: Chris Rock and Steve Martin talked about the lack of \u201cvaginas\u201d in the best director category; Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s opening number highlighted ethnically diverse films, such as Hustlers and Farewell, neither of which were nominated; Utkarsh Ambudkar passionately rapped about the ceremony\u2019s various inclusive nods. And yet the Oscars could have saved themselves all this self-flagellation for not being inclusive if they had just been more, you know, inclusive \u2013 if, that is, they actually care about it, and given that only one person of colour was nominated in the acting categories (Cynthia Erivo for Harriet), you could only assume they don\u2019t. Singers and actors of colour were relegated to performances (Mon\u00e1e, Erivo), but denied nominations and awards. You can entertain us, but you can\u2019t win, in other words. (That the event featured a bewilderingly random appearance by a rapper, and for that rapper to turn out to be Eminem, the one white rapper in the business, felt almost like a meta joke.)</p> <p>The thinness of the whole enterprise seemed to be summed up when Brie Larson, Gal Gadot and Sigourney Weaver presented the award for best original score. Weaver excitedly announced that, for the first time, a female conductor would lead the montage, which seemed like a fairly low-stakes compensation for the lack of women nominees in some major categories. \u201cAll women are superheroes!\u201d Weaver crowed. Yeah, they are superheroes, but apparently not directors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b580981a3f9624bb6ab28a44942c553aa543490\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b580981a3f9624bb6ab28a44942c553aa543490/0_202_4908_2945/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir collects the Oscar for best original score, applauded by Brie Larson, Sigourney Weaver and Gal Gadot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir collects the Oscar for best original score, applauded by Brie Larson, Sigourney Weaver and Gal Gadot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Latour/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But then something changed. The one woman nominated for best original score actually won it: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/13/joker-and-chernobyl-composer-hildur-gunadottir-im-treasure-hunting\" title=\"\">Hildur </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/13/joker-and-chernobyl-composer-hildur-gunadottir-im-treasure-hunting\" title=\"\">Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir for Joker</a>. And then, of course, there was Parasite; its sweeping triumph seemed unimaginable before the ceremony but, by the end, felt downright inevitable. Being in a foreign language is officially no longer a bar to an American award. It helped, too, perhaps, that, even when he was speaking Korean, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/parasite-first-foreign-language-film-to-win-best-picture-oscar\" title=\"\">Bong Joon-ho\u2019s speeches</a> were decidedly more comprehensible than those by some of the other winners, not least Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who allegedly spoke English in her speech, but only theoretically. As for Phoenix\u2019s much commented-on speech, yes, OK, he talked about \u201cartificially inseminating cows\u201d, not a subject generally associated with the Oscars. Beyond all the dairy chat, though, Phoenix\u2019s reference to his late brother, River, was, alongside Bong\u2019s salutes to Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino, genuinely moving; real emotion among all the nonsense.</p> <p>But diversity is not just about race and gender \u2013 it is also about class, one factor that remained not so much pointedly as just blithely unremarked upon in all the Oscars speeches. This seems pretty ironic, given what won best film. Sure, in the context of an American film awards, Parasite\u2019s win looks like a triumph of a racial minority and a linguistic outsider, but the film itself is as class-focused as anything in the oeuvre of Ken Loach. And in this regard, the Oscars were as endearingly ludicrous as ever.</p> <p>After everyone in the Dolby theatre recovered from dislocating their shoulder after patting themselves on the back for Parasite\u2019s win, we made our way to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2020/feb/10/razzle-and-dazzle-oscars-2020-after-parties-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Governor\u2019s Ball</a>, the official Oscars after-party. And what better way to celebrate a movie about the rising up of an underclass than a party where waiters were dutifully spraying gold dust on mini chocolate Oscars for the guests\u2019 enjoyment? If it was hard to see the celebrities from behind the white screen on the red carpet, it was downright impossible in the Governor\u2019s Ball, with the whole room filled with golden flecks of dust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5aa4407445b60753d39b99ae1fadaf2b57756b21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aa4407445b60753d39b99ae1fadaf2b57756b21/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mini chocolate Oscars line up for the VIPs at the Governor\u2019s Ball.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mini chocolate Oscars line up for the VIPs at the Governor\u2019s Ball.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Val\u00e9rie Macon/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe whole evening has been dripping with glamour!\u201d was the nominee Florence Pugh\u2019s take on it. But this was Pugh\u2019s debut at the Oscars, and that was a verdict only a first-timer could make. One of the many strange things about the Oscars is that, for an event so exclusive and elite, it feels decidedly tacky and overcrowded \u2013 a bit like a Hilton hotel, really. And it gets palpably worse every year.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love to talk but I\u2019m just trying to find my table,\u201d an understandably bewildered Quentin Tarantino said, gazing at the waves of people at the ball, who made it feel less like a party and more like a bottlenecked protest that was about to turn nasty.</p> <p>In one of my favourite episodes of Frasier, Dr Crane\u2019s pleasure in an exclusive spa is ruined when he discovers there is a secret door that will take him, he assumes, to an even more exclusive spa. How can one enjoy being a VIP when there exists the status of VVIP, and VVVIP? At the Governor\u2019s Ball, the nominees and audience ostensibly mix together, but every year there are more and more roped-off areas, accessible only to the nominees and people such as the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, who makes an annual appearance. And even within those areas there are more exclusive circles: it shouldn\u2019t have been hard for Tarantino to find his table, because it was the one with all the cameraphones around it. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood might not have done as well as Tarantino surely hoped, but this was by some measure the most stared-at table, with guests gawking excitedly from both sides of the rope as Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt affected not to see them and gave each other manly hugs. God forbid the extremely rich should have to mix with the merely rich.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2020/feb/10/razzle-and-dazzle-oscars-2020-after-parties-in-pictures\">Razzle and dazzle: Oscars 2020 after-parties \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tom Hanks was inside the rope and he chatted with people on the outside (while always staying on the inside). \u201cThis room has too many people, it\u2019s too hot and the music is too loud,\u201d he said cheerfully (and correctly).</p> <p>So what\u2019s it like being on the inside of the rope?</p> <p>\u201cAh, this is to keep the journalists and the rest of the riff-raff out,\u201d he twinkled Hankishly.</p> <p>On a banquette outside the rope, Spike Lee surveyed the crowds.

So when I bumped into Hanks leaving with his family 20 minutes after speaking to him at the party, he, of course, did not remember me. But there are exceptions to this rule. Keanu Reeves \u2013 not a celebrity generally spotted at these events \u2013 came to the Oscars this year and I nervously approached him and garbled some nonsense question about how he found it all. He stared at me, confused.</p> <p>\u201cI know you \u2013 we met last spring!\u201d he said, and he was right \u2013 I interviewed him almost a year ago. I was so taken aback by this inversion of the norms that I ran away blushing, a peasant overcome by the kindness of a king.</p> <p>There was a notable absence from the ball, however: where were the Parasite people? Someone said they were having their own private party, which seemed too ironic to be true, so I went to the Vanity Fair party in case they were there.</p> <p>Now, the Vanity Fair party is a far cry from what it once was \u2013 too crowded, too full of randoms like me. But it\u2019s hard not to be amused by a party where, by the bar, you find Usher, Jake Gyllenhaal and Caitlyn Jenner, and, outside in the garden, there is James Corden, Donatella Versace and Nicky Hilton. But not everyone is accessible: I was told that Pitt, DiCaprio and Phoenix promised to grace the party with their presences, but only if it was guaranteed they would be left alone. Also: still no Parasite people. \u201cOh, they are having their own party at Soho House,\u201d someone told me, because, sure, where else would they be but at a private members\u2019 club? I briefly considered fulfilling the spirit of the movie by breaking into Soho House, pretending to be a waiter and then stealing all of their Oscars. But fortunately for them, I know my place, and my place by then was bed, and I headed home.</p>",

It felt \u2013 and yes, you might have seen this Parasite analogy coming \u2013 like being stuck in the basement, watching the rich and the beautiful frolic in the sunshine above us. \u201cMy progress in was remarkably smooth \u2013 it always looked like chaos on TV, but the red carpet was fine,\u201d the nominee Jonathan Pryce told me in the theatre\u2019s atrium. \u201cBut then maybe I got the VIP fast-track treatment,\u201d he concluded, correctly. Then there was the ceremony, and it looked initially as if we were in for three hours of the Oscars arguing with, er, the Oscars. Oscars v Oscars: at last, Hollywood has found a movie that sounds even less enticing than Suicide Squad. Presenter after presenter ragged on the ceremony for its lack of diversity: Chris Rock and Steve Martin talked about the lack of \u201cvaginas\u201d in the best director category; Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s opening number highlighted ethnically diverse films, such as Hustlers and Farewell, neither of which were nominated; Utkarsh Ambudkar passionately rapped about the ceremony\u2019s various inclusive nods. And yet the Oscars could have saved themselves all this self-flagellation for not being inclusive if they had just been more, you know, inclusive \u2013 if, that is, they actually care about it, and given that only one person of colour was nominated in the acting categories (Cynthia Erivo for Harriet), you could only assume they don\u2019t. Singers and actors of colour were relegated to performances (Mon\u00e1e, Erivo), but denied nominations and awards. You can entertain us, but you can\u2019t win, in other words. (That the event featured a bewilderingly random appearance by a rapper, and for that rapper to turn out to be Eminem, the one white rapper in the business, felt almost like a meta joke.) The thinness of the whole enterprise seemed to be summed up when Brie Larson, Gal Gadot and Sigourney Weaver presented the award for best original score. Weaver excitedly announced that, for the first time, a female conductor would lead the montage, which seemed like a fairly low-stakes compensation for the lack of women nominees in some major categories. \u201cAll women are superheroes!\u201d Weaver crowed. Yeah, they are superheroes, but apparently not directors. But then something changed. The one woman nominated for best original score actually won it: Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir for Joker. And then, of course, there was Parasite; its sweeping triumph seemed unimaginable before the ceremony but, by the end, felt downright inevitable. Being in a foreign language is officially no longer a bar to an American award. It helped, too, perhaps, that, even when he was speaking Korean, Bong Joon-ho\u2019s speeches were decidedly more comprehensible than those by some of the other winners, not least Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who allegedly spoke English in her speech, but only theoretically. As for Phoenix\u2019s much commented-on speech, yes, OK, he talked about \u201cartificially inseminating cows\u201d, not a subject generally associated with the Oscars. Beyond all the dairy chat, though, Phoenix\u2019s reference to his late brother, River, was, alongside Bong\u2019s salutes to Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino, genuinely moving; real emotion among all the nonsense. But diversity is not just about race and gender \u2013 it is also about class, one factor that remained not so much pointedly as just blithely unremarked upon in all the Oscars speeches. This seems pretty ironic, given what won best film. Sure, in the context of an American film awards, Parasite\u2019s win looks like a triumph of a racial minority and a linguistic outsider, but the film itself is as class-focused as anything in the oeuvre of Ken Loach. And in this regard, the Oscars were as endearingly ludicrous as ever. After everyone in the Dolby theatre recovered from dislocating their shoulder after patting themselves on the back for Parasite\u2019s win, we made our way to the Governor\u2019s Ball, the official Oscars after-party. And what better way to celebrate a movie about the rising up of an underclass than a party where waiters were dutifully spraying gold dust on mini chocolate Oscars for the guests\u2019 enjoyment? If it was hard to see the celebrities from behind the white screen on the red carpet, it was downright impossible in the Governor\u2019s Ball, with the whole room filled with golden flecks of dust. \u201cThe whole evening has been dripping with glamour!\u201d was the nominee Florence Pugh\u2019s take on it. But this was Pugh\u2019s debut at the Oscars, and that was a verdict only a first-timer could make. One of the many strange things about the Oscars is that, for an event so exclusive and elite, it feels decidedly tacky and overcrowded \u2013 a bit like a Hilton hotel, really. And it gets palpably worse every year. \u201cI\u2019d love to talk but I\u2019m just trying to find my table,\u201d an understandably bewildered Quentin Tarantino said, gazing at the waves of people at the ball, who made it feel less like a party and more like a bottlenecked protest that was about to turn nasty. In one of my favourite episodes of Frasier, Dr Crane\u2019s pleasure in an exclusive spa is ruined when he discovers there is a secret door that will take him, he assumes, to an even more exclusive spa. How can one enjoy being a VIP when there exists the status of VVIP, and VVVIP? At the Governor\u2019s Ball, the nominees and audience ostensibly mix together, but every year there are more and more roped-off areas, accessible only to the nominees and people such as the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, who makes an annual appearance. And even within those areas there are more exclusive circles: it shouldn\u2019t have been hard for Tarantino to find his table, because it was the one with all the cameraphones around it. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood might not have done as well as Tarantino surely hoped, but this was by some measure the most stared-at table, with guests gawking excitedly from both sides of the rope as Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt affected not to see them and gave each other manly hugs. God forbid the extremely rich should have to mix with the merely rich. Tom Hanks was inside the rope and he chatted with people on the outside (while always staying on the inside). \u201cThis room has too many people, it\u2019s too hot and the music is too loud,\u201d he said cheerfully (and correctly). So what\u2019s it like being on the inside of the rope? \u201cAh, this is to keep the journalists and the rest of the riff-raff out,\u201d he twinkled Hankishly. On a banquette outside the rope, Spike Lee surveyed the crowds. Did he think that the Oscars were getting more diverse, as they kept promising? \u201cThe struggle continues,\u201d he replied. Didn\u2019t he think the Academy just used performers of ethnic minorities to perform in the ceremony as a smokescreen to distract from systemic problems in the industry? He allowed himself a small smirk: \u201cThe struggle continues.\u201d One of the most obvious differences between celebrities and civilians \u2013 to use Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s eternally useful term for people who aren\u2019t her \u2013 is that the latter will always remember that they met the former, but the reverse is not true. So when I bumped into Hanks leaving with his family 20 minutes after speaking to him at the party, he, of course, did not remember me. But there are exceptions to this rule. Keanu Reeves \u2013 not a celebrity generally spotted at these events \u2013 came to the Oscars this year and I nervously approached him and garbled some nonsense question about how he found it all. He stared at me, confused. \u201cI know you \u2013 we met last spring!\u201d he said, and he was right \u2013 I interviewed him almost a year ago. I was so taken aback by this inversion of the norms that I ran away blushing, a peasant overcome by the kindness of a king. There was a notable absence from the ball, however: where were the Parasite people? Someone said they were having their own private party, which seemed too ironic to be true, so I went to the Vanity Fair party in case they were there. Now, the Vanity Fair party is a far cry from what it once was \u2013 too crowded, too full of randoms like me. But it\u2019s hard not to be amused by a party where, by the bar, you find Usher, Jake Gyllenhaal and Caitlyn Jenner, and, outside in the garden, there is James Corden, Donatella Versace and Nicky Hilton. But not everyone is accessible: I was told that Pitt, DiCaprio and Phoenix promised to grace the party with their presences, but only if it was guaranteed they would be left alone. Also: still no Parasite people. \u201cOh, they are having their own party at Soho House,\u201d someone told me, because, sure, where else would they be but at a private members\u2019 club? I briefly considered fulfilling the spirit of the movie by breaking into Soho House, pretending to be a waiter and then stealing all of their Oscars. But fortunately for them, I know my place, and my place by then was bed, and I headed home.",

      "bodyText": "Girls are beginning puberty almost a year earlier than women 40 years ago, according to research. Scientists have found the onset of development of glandular breast tissue has crept forwards by about three months per decade since the late 1970s. Puberty generally begins between eight and 13 years in girls and nine and 14 years for boys. However, a number of global studies suggest the average age of puberty is falling. For girls, experts say the best marker of the start of puberty is the development of glandular breast tissue, known as thelarche. Researchers say they have reviewed studies on the milestone to reveal that puberty in girls has shifted, on average, three months earlier per decade from 1977 to 2013. Dr Alexander Busch, the co-author of the research, from Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, said the work was the first to draw together and analyse studies focusing on thelarche. \u201cThat means also that there are not many studies out there concerning the implications of early breast development for [girls\u2019] lifelong health,\u201d he said, adding that early onset of menstruation was linked to a higher risk of conditions including obesity and cardiovascular disease. While the age of first menstruation, or menarche, decreased in the early 20th century, some research has suggested onset has shifted little in recent decades. However, Busch and colleagues say looking at menarche as a marker of the onset of puberty is problematic, not least because it often relies on women recalling when their periods began, while menstruation begins later in puberty than other developments. Instead the team focused on thelarche, with Busch noting the clinicians had seen a rise in the number of children under eight showing development of glandular breast tissue. Writing in the journal Jama Pediatrics, Busch and colleagues say they examined data from 38 studies published before mid-2019 that involved expert assessment of girls\u2019 breast tissue. The team excluded research looking at children with certain diseases, or who were severely malnourished or pathologically obese, because these conditions may affect the onset of puberty. The team found that development of glandular breast tissue varied around the world and over time, with studies reporting an average age of onset between 9.8 and 10.8 years in Europe, depending on country and year, compared with 10.1 to 13.2 years in Africa and 8.8 to 10.3 years in the US. The team\u2019s analysis suggests the age of such changes is getting younger, with onset starting 0.24 years earlier per decade from 1977 to 2013. While the research does not explore why puberty may be starting earlier in girls, the team say a higher body mass index is linked to earlier development of glandular breast tissue. \u201cThe ongoing global obesity epidemic could partially explain the observed change in age at pubertal onset assessed as age at thelarche,\u201d the authors write. However, they also say a number of studies have suggested that chemicals in the environment that may interfere with the body\u2019s hormone-based system could also play a role. Busch said many factors were probably at play: \u201cIt is important to proceed to monitor this as early puberty has implications. However, fighting childhood obesity and avoiding excessive exposure to environmental chemicals could help to avoid early pubertal onset.\u201d The study has some limitations, including that many studies did not report the body mass index of participants, and some studies were small. However, the team says the new findings matter since they may mean that experts need to rethink current age cut-offs used to determine early puberty, to avoid healthy children being sent for brain scans and other tests. Peter Hindmarsh, a professor of paediatric endocrinology at University College London, who was not involved in the study, said it was not yet clear whether the whole process of puberty in girls was shifting earlier, or whether it was only starting earlier and hence lasting longer. \u201cThis trend towards an earlier start of puberty with breast development is interesting, but at this stage is not going to impact on how we approach early puberty and the definition of early puberty,\u201d he said.",

In new guidance on the contracts, the body also underlined that contracts should not be used to prevent the reporting of discrimination or harassment to the police. NDAs, or \u201cgagging orders\u201d, are widely used across industries, including film, advertising, finance, universities and the health service, typically to prevent staff from making information public. The legally drafted contracts can apply to sensitive commercial information or trade secrets, but can also be used to prevent the spreading of anything likely to damage an organisation\u2019s reputation. Last year, a report by MPs warned that claims of unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment at work were routinely being covered up by employers through the use of the contracts. Susan Clews, the chief executive of Acas, said: \u201cNDAs can be used legitimately in some situations but they should not be used routinely or to prevent someone from reporting sexual harassment, discrimination or whistleblowing at work. \u201cOur new advice can help employers and their staff understand what NDAs are, how to prevent their misuse and examples where they will not be needed.\u201d The advice, set out on Monday, also urged employers to ensure workers were given a reasonable amount of time to consult trade union or legal advice on the implications of NDAs, and think about \u201cwhether it\u2019s better to address an issue head on\u201d rather than to cover it up. Acas also flagged that the contracts \u2013 which usually involve a payment to the employee \u2013 should not be used routinely, and that managers who helped to draw up such agreements should be well trained in their use. NDAs gained particular notoriety after the #MeToo scandal broke and Harvey Weinstein\u2019s prolific use of them to keep a lid on allegations of sexual harassment and assault was exposed. In the Weinstein Company\u2019s bankruptcy filing in 2018, it stated that it released anyone \u201cwho suffered or witnessed any form of sexual misconduct\u201d by the Hollywood film producer from their NDAs. Weinstein, who is on trial in New York accused of rape, has denied any non-consensual sex. The frequent practice of using NDAs in UK universities to prevent staff from going public with claims of bullying or sexual misconduct has also caused outrage. Figures obtained by the BBC last year showed that UK establishments had spent about \u00a387m on pay-offs with NDAs since 2017.",

They had been cautiously optimistic the new flood defences would hold. However, their optimism was misplaced and their cellar was destroyed along with all their stock. There was at least \u00a310,000 of damage they will have to pay for themselves: like almost everyone on Mytholmroyd\u2019s main street, they have been unable to get flood insurance.</p> <p>Creagh said the government should help businesses like theirs get back on their feet. \u201cFloods kill villages and towns because people won\u2019t open businesses here.

A good time to focus, at last, on urgent geopolitical challenges: Trump, China, the eurozone.</p> <p>Instead, the decision by some delegates of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in eastern Germany to defy a party ban on cooperating with the AfD did not only lead to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/annegret-kramp-karrenbauer-to-quit-as-cdu-leader-amid-far-right-firewall-row\">resignation of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/annegret-kramp-karrenbauer-to-quit-as-cdu-leader-amid-far-right-firewall-row\">Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer</a>, the chancellor\u2019s designated successor, but also ripped up all existing plans for what Germany\u2019s post-Merkel era might look like, or when it will start.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/annegret-kramp-karrenbauer-to-quit-as-cdu-leader-amid-far-right-firewall-row\">Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to quit as CDU leader amid far-right 'firewall' row</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be long now until we have fresh elections,\u201d the former Social Democrat (SPD) deputy chancellor Sigmar Gabriel told the tabloid Bild on Monday. \u201cWe are currently witnessing the end of Germany\u2019s second large big-tent party.\u201d</p> <p>\ufeffIn terms of strategy, the debate inside Merkel\u2019s party over the coming months will be about whether the rise of the AfD is best dealt with by shunning the far right completely, or whether to countenance cooperations at regional levels \u2013 even if for now none of the contenders are likely to propose a power-sharing deal at federal level, as the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, did with the far-right Freedom party.</p> <p>At the root of this debate, however, is also a wider problem about the unity of the conservative party that has governed and defined the country through 50 of the last 70 years. Merkel\u2019s party in its present form is a post-reunification fusion of the western CDU, defined by staunch Rhineland Catholics such as its towering leaders Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, and an eastern offshoot that supported and voted with the Socialist Unity party in the de facto one-party state.</p> <p>After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/the-guardian-view-on-the-fall-of-the-berlin-wall-historys-lessons\">fall of the Berlin Wall</a>, the CDU was swiftly fused into one party and its ideological inconsistencies covered over \u2013 but they could now come back to haunt it.</p> <p>\u201cUnder Kohl, the CDU\u2019s headquarters dealt with the remaining left-leaning tendencies of its eastern branches by parachuting in western Christian Democrats to head the party in the eastern states,\u201d said Gero Neugebauer, a political historian at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin. \u201cThat strategy used to work \u2013 it no longer seems to work now.\u201d</p> <p>If the defiance of red lines by CDU politicians in Thuringia exposed Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s lack of authority, her successor is likely to face similar tests of strength: in Saxony-Anhalt, where there are elections in June 2021, CDU leaders have already said they would consider forming a minority government with the AfD.</p> <p>Some German commentators believe the only way for Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s successor to gain the authority necessary to face such challenges is to not only step out of Merkel\u2019s shadow, but to push her out of the sun altogether.</p> <p>\u201cAll candidates who now step forward should really combine their candidacy with a call for fresh elections,\u201d said Melanie Amann in Der Spiegel. \u201cThere are therefore only two logical ways out of the current impasse: in order to survive, the CDU will have to convince a chancellor with record-level popularity ratings to step down. Or this chancellor will have to step down out of her own accord.\u201d</p> <p>The future of the CDU also throws up speculation about possible coalition-building after the next election. The resurgent Green party, currently second in national polls, will be watching debates among conservatives closely to work out whether it can still consider forming the country\u2019s first conservative-green coalition government without a Merkel figure as a moderating influence.</p> <p>Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt, the Green party group leader in the Bundestag, warned Christian Democrats against veering to the right. \u201cLet\u2019s hope the CDU will show us that a Christian Democratic party won\u2019t allow itself to be humiliated by an extreme-right AfD.\u201d</p> <p>The co-leader of the leftwing Die Linke party, Katja Kipping, bemoaned the demise of Kramp-Karrenbauer, saying she had \u201cdemarcated the CDU against the right and thus saved its soul\u201d. </p> <p>For the rest of this year the world will have to get used to an inward-facing Germany, unlikely to stray outside of its comfort zones.</p>",

With regular elections only scheduled for the city state of Hamburg, where the centre-left remains strong and the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party (AfD) is projected to get an underwhelming 7% share of the vote, Angela Merkel\u2019s last full year in power promised to be a stable pathway into her political retirement. A good time to focus, at last, on urgent geopolitical challenges: Trump, China, the eurozone. Instead, the decision by some delegates of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in eastern Germany to defy a party ban on cooperating with the AfD did not only lead to the resignation of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the chancellor\u2019s designated successor, but also ripped up all existing plans for what Germany\u2019s post-Merkel era might look like, or when it will start. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long now until we have fresh elections,\u201d the former Social Democrat (SPD) deputy chancellor Sigmar Gabriel told the tabloid Bild on Monday. \u201cWe are currently witnessing the end of Germany\u2019s second large big-tent party.\u201d \ufeffIn terms of strategy, the debate inside Merkel\u2019s party over the coming months will be about whether the rise of the AfD is best dealt with by shunning the far right completely, or whether to countenance cooperations at regional levels \u2013 even if for now none of the contenders are likely to propose a power-sharing deal at federal level, as the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, did with the far-right Freedom party. At the root of this debate, however, is also a wider problem about the unity of the conservative party that has governed and defined the country through 50 of the last 70 years. Merkel\u2019s party in its present form is a post-reunification fusion of the western CDU, defined by staunch Rhineland Catholics such as its towering leaders Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, and an eastern offshoot that supported and voted with the Socialist Unity party in the de facto one-party state. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the CDU was swiftly fused into one party and its ideological inconsistencies covered over \u2013 but they could now come back to haunt it. \u201cUnder Kohl, the CDU\u2019s headquarters dealt with the remaining left-leaning tendencies of its eastern branches by parachuting in western Christian Democrats to head the party in the eastern states,\u201d said Gero Neugebauer, a political historian at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin. \u201cThat strategy used to work \u2013 it no longer seems to work now.\u201d If the defiance of red lines by CDU politicians in Thuringia exposed Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s lack of authority, her successor is likely to face similar tests of strength: in Saxony-Anhalt, where there are elections in June 2021, CDU leaders have already said they would consider forming a minority government with the AfD. Some German commentators believe the only way for Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s successor to gain the authority necessary to face such challenges is to not only step out of Merkel\u2019s shadow, but to push her out of the sun altogether. \u201cAll candidates who now step forward should really combine their candidacy with a call for fresh elections,\u201d said Melanie Amann in Der Spiegel. \u201cThere are therefore only two logical ways out of the current impasse: in order to survive, the CDU will have to convince a chancellor with record-level popularity ratings to step down. Or this chancellor will have to step down out of her own accord.\u201d The future of the CDU also throws up speculation about possible coalition-building after the next election. The resurgent Green party, currently second in national polls, will be watching debates among conservatives closely to work out whether it can still consider forming the country\u2019s first conservative-green coalition government without a Merkel figure as a moderating influence. Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt, the Green party group leader in the Bundestag, warned Christian Democrats against veering to the right. \u201cLet\u2019s hope the CDU will show us that a Christian Democratic party won\u2019t allow itself to be humiliated by an extreme-right AfD.\u201d The co-leader of the leftwing Die Linke party, Katja Kipping, bemoaned the demise of Kramp-Karrenbauer, saying she had \u201cdemarcated the CDU against the right and thus saved its soul\u201d. For the rest of this year the world will have to get used to an inward-facing Germany, unlikely to stray outside of its comfort zones.",

Instead it paid the \u00a33.38m immediately to a company owned by Blitz. On the same day Oldham council made an additional payment to the club for the Lancaster Club site, of \u00a31.2m, specifically to develop the North Stand. The council made the \u00a3700,000 grant the previous year, also to build the stand, requiring the club to maintain community programmes and other social benefits.</p> <p>In 2016, when the stand was built following these three deals totalling approximately \u00a35.2m, Oldham agreed to surrender to Blitz\u2019s company, Brass Bank, the club\u2019s rights to all revenues from the new banqueting and other facilities. The club retained only the right to sell match tickets and some sales outlets and a deal was done for corporate boxes on matchdays. In return Blitz wrote off a debt the club was stated to owe his company, of \u00a33.8m plus VAT.</p> <p>Lemsagam is asking why the \u00a33.38m the council paid the club for the Lancaster club site was then passed to Blitz and why Blitz then only loaned a similar sum back to the club to build the stand and took ownership of the commercial rights. Lemsagam told the Guardian that, when he found out about this, he initiated lawyers and forensic accountants to look into it and they have \u201cmanaged to find very few answers\u201d.</p> <p>Blitz, though, says the answers are long-established. His lawyer, Crook, explains that the council did indeed buy the Lancaster Club site from the club. He said the site was owned by Blitz but the council wanted the purchase that way, directly from the club. So it was done as a \u201cback to back\u201d sale, whereby Blitz sold the site to the club, which immediately sold it on to the council and paid the proceeds to Blitz\u2019s company. That was publicly documented; the Land Registry records the two sales of the site on the same day, 25 May 2012: from Blitz\u2019s company to the club, then the club to the council.</p> <p>A spokesman for Oldham borough council said the council\u2019s dealings with Oldham Athletic \u201chave been transparent and well documented\u201d but declined to explain why the Lancaster Club deal had been done in that way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Blitz\u2019s position is that he had bought the site originally because the council proposed it for a new stadium, but the council was then unable to develop adjoining land, so they agreed to buy it back from him.</p> <p>The sale of that land was not directly related to building the North Stand, he says. Separately, to finance that, he lent the club \u00a33.8m. Over his years of ownership Blitz says he put in around \u00a314m, points to the reduced rent on Boundary Park and says the North Stand deal is good for the club as he wrote off the \u00a33.8m owed.</p> <p>Lemsagam says his investigation is continuing and legal action being considered. Blitz\u2019s lawyer said: \u201cThe suggestion of criminal conduct is categorically denied, and we have had no contact from the police. The club\u2019s allegation that it has grounds for bringing legal claims is also denied; the position is that there are substantial sums owed by the Club to Brass Bank, which it is refusing to pay.\u201d</p> <p>All of which makes the Oldham wonder years, Joe Royle\u2019s managerial feats that led in 1992 to the club happily becoming a founder member of the Premier League breakaway elite, feel like a very long time ago.</p>",

Lemsagam told the Guardian that, when he found out about this, he initiated lawyers and forensic accountants to look into it and they have \u201cmanaged to find very few answers\u201d. Blitz, though, says the answers are long-established. His lawyer, Crook, explains that the council did indeed buy the Lancaster Club site from the club. He said the site was owned by Blitz but the council wanted the purchase that way, directly from the club. So it was done as a \u201cback to back\u201d sale, whereby Blitz sold the site to the club, which immediately sold it on to the council and paid the proceeds to Blitz\u2019s company. That was publicly documented; the Land Registry records the two sales of the site on the same day, 25 May 2012: from Blitz\u2019s company to the club, then the club to the council. A spokesman for Oldham borough council said the council\u2019s dealings with Oldham Athletic \u201chave been transparent and well documented\u201d but declined to explain why the Lancaster Club deal had been done in that way. Blitz\u2019s position is that he had bought the site originally because the council proposed it for a new stadium, but the council was then unable to develop adjoining land, so they agreed to buy it back from him. The sale of that land was not directly related to building the North Stand, he says. Separately, to finance that, he lent the club \u00a33.8m. Over his years of ownership Blitz says he put in around \u00a314m, points to the reduced rent on Boundary Park and says the North Stand deal is good for the club as he wrote off the \u00a33.8m owed. Lemsagam says his investigation is continuing and legal action being considered. Blitz\u2019s lawyer said: \u201cThe suggestion of criminal conduct is categorically denied, and we have had no contact from the police. The club\u2019s allegation that it has grounds for bringing legal claims is also denied; the position is that there are substantial sums owed by the Club to Brass Bank, which it is refusing to pay.\u201d All of which makes the Oldham wonder years, Joe Royle\u2019s managerial feats that led in 1992 to the club happily becoming a founder member of the Premier League breakaway elite, feel like a very long time ago.",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m being held at the Harmondsworth immigration removal centre, next to Heathrow airport. Tomorrow I\u2019m due to be deported to Jamaica. My kids don\u2019t know yet that they might be about to lose their dad. On the phone they keep asking me: \u201cDaddy, when are you coming home?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Where I want to be is home, with my wife and family. If I was there today, I\u2019d have walked my 10-year-old girl to school</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I don\u2019t know what to tell them because what \u201chome\u201d means is exactly the problem. The home my kids are talking about is Nottingham, where we live. But when the government talks about sending me \u201cback\u201d, they mean a place that\u2019s completely foreign to me \u2013 Jamaica. I have no family in Jamaica; my parents, siblings, aunts and uncles all live in the UK and have British citizenship. I first came here 20 years ago when I was nine. Britain is where I went to school and raised a family. I grew up going to football matches at Nottingham Forest. For a time, I even worked at the Walkers Crisps factory. Still, the UK government considers me a \u201cforeign\u201d criminal.</p> <p>Behind the walls and bars of a detention centre it\u2019s easy to feel that you\u2019re a criminal. It\u2019s true, I committed a drug-related crime<strong> </strong>for which I was sentenced to 20 months in prison. But although I made a mistake, I\u2019ve served my time in prison. I shouldn\u2019t be punished for ever.</p> <p>What good does it do to split up a family? A prison sentence has already ripped mine apart. I don\u2019t want to think about what will happen to my family if I\u2019m sent to Jamaica. I can\u2019t imagine not being here to see my kids grow up.</p> <p>Where I want to be is home, with my wife and family. If I was there today, I\u2019d have walked my 10-year-old girl to school. She was born here, and I often think how fortunate she is to have grown up in Britain. Locked inside, I find myself remembering the large stack of books in her bedroom and the number of new words she\u2019s learned.</p> <p>You feel so powerless when you\u2019re detained. In here, it\u2019s all about lawyers and finding evidence and signing forms. But that\u2019s hard to do when you can\u2019t call anyone. We didn\u2019t have a phone signal for weeks. Sealed off from the outside world, we couldn\u2019t contact our lawyers or families. Many of us thought the process of deportation would be stopped, given that we hadn\u2019t been able to speak with anyone \u2013 but the Home Office is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/10/minister-defends-jamaica-deportation-flight-decision-windrush\" title=\"\">still intent</a> on going ahead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/10/minister-defends-jamaica-deportation-flight-decision-windrush\">Minister defends Jamaica deportation flight decision</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The idea that people like me are \u201cforeign\u201d criminals who should be deported without questions being asked sounds compellingly simple. But is someone who has lived their life in the UK, paid taxes and raised a family here really \u201cforeign\u201d?</p> <p>In the detention centre people are talking a lot about Windrush. People who came to Britain from Jamaica and built their lives here thought they were British \u2013 until they were told they weren\u2019t. They didn\u2019t have a fair chance. And neither do we.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to stay strong, but I\u2019m worried.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m being held at the Harmondsworth immigration removal centre, next to Heathrow airport. Tomorrow I\u2019m due to be deported to Jamaica. My kids don\u2019t know yet that they might be about to lose their dad. On the phone they keep asking me: \u201cDaddy, when are you coming home?\u201d I don\u2019t know what to tell them because what \u201chome\u201d means is exactly the problem. The home my kids are talking about is Nottingham, where we live. But when the government talks about sending me \u201cback\u201d, they mean a place that\u2019s completely foreign to me \u2013 Jamaica. I have no family in Jamaica; my parents, siblings, aunts and uncles all live in the UK and have British citizenship. I first came here 20 years ago when I was nine. Britain is where I went to school and raised a family. I grew up going to football matches at Nottingham Forest. For a time, I even worked at the Walkers Crisps factory. Still, the UK government considers me a \u201cforeign\u201d criminal. Behind the walls and bars of a detention centre it\u2019s easy to feel that you\u2019re a criminal. It\u2019s true, I committed a drug-related crime for which I was sentenced to 20 months in prison. But although I made a mistake, I\u2019ve served my time in prison. I shouldn\u2019t be punished for ever. What good does it do to split up a family? A prison sentence has already ripped mine apart. I don\u2019t want to think about what will happen to my family if I\u2019m sent to Jamaica. I can\u2019t imagine not being here to see my kids grow up. Where I want to be is home, with my wife and family. If I was there today, I\u2019d have walked my 10-year-old girl to school. She was born here, and I often think how fortunate she is to have grown up in Britain. Locked inside, I find myself remembering the large stack of books in her bedroom and the number of new words she\u2019s learned. You feel so powerless when you\u2019re detained. In here, it\u2019s all about lawyers and finding evidence and signing forms. But that\u2019s hard to do when you can\u2019t call anyone. We didn\u2019t have a phone signal for weeks. Sealed off from the outside world, we couldn\u2019t contact our lawyers or families. Many of us thought the process of deportation would be stopped, given that we hadn\u2019t been able to speak with anyone \u2013 but the Home Office is still intent on going ahead. The idea that people like me are \u201cforeign\u201d criminals who should be deported without questions being asked sounds compellingly simple. But is someone who has lived their life in the UK, paid taxes and raised a family here really \u201cforeign\u201d? In the detention centre people are talking a lot about Windrush. People who came to Britain from Jamaica and built their lives here thought they were British \u2013 until they were told they weren\u2019t. They didn\u2019t have a fair chance. And neither do we. I\u2019m trying to stay strong, but I\u2019m worried. Today could be my last day in Britain before I\u2019m forced to board a plane tomorrow, headed to a country where I really will be a foreigner. \u2022 Michael McDonald, a client of Detention Action, is due to be deported from the UK to Jamaica on 11 February 2020",

Tonight marks the end of a long and gruelling awards season, full of snubs (Uncut Gems, Midsommar, people who aren\u2019t white men) and dangerously low on surprises.</p> \n  <p>If the other awards this year have taught us anything, it\u2019s that Brad Pitt will win best supporting actor and charm us with a suspiciously funny speech; and that Joaquin Phoenix will win best actor and shout at us like an especially hungover supply teacher. There\u2019s still a question mark hovering over the recipient of best picture \u2013 although many suggest that 1917 will nose it \u2013 but aside from that, this might well be the Oscars on autopilot. </p> \n  <p>But you\u2019re not here to see who wins an Oscar, are you? You\u2019re here because for some reason you really, really like reading liveblogs of American award ceremonies as written by a tired British person in a different time zone. So let me tell you what\u2019s going to happen this evening. For the next two hours, I\u2019ll be following the (uncharacteristically soggy) red carpet action with help from the very talented Guardian fashion team. As a word of advice, I\u2019ll be watching and commenting the E! red carpet show (on the Sky Oscars channel in the UK) \u2013 which from memory is like getting a concussion and then receiving a Red Bull enema \u2013 so try to watch it along with me, unless you perversely enjoy attempting to decode dozens and dozens of context-dependent semi-jokes for hours on end.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d9fee0195c4bfbddd3368996b569f4aa8aa78c8\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d9fee0195c4bfbddd3368996b569f4aa8aa78c8/0_0_5354_3213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No fat ladies \u2026 our Oscars bingo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No fat ladies \u2026 our Oscars bingo.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And once that\u2019s done, the real fun will begin. The 92nd Academy Awards kick off at 1am GMT and, if previous years are any indication, will grind on obliviously until the heat death of the universe. It will be exhausting and dispiriting, but at least we have our entire, amazing film desk on hand throughout the night for reaction and analysis. In the meantime, here\u2019s the annual Oscars bingo card [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/picture/2020/feb/09/brad-pitt-tells-us-hes-single-play-oscars-bingo\">try here for a bigger version</a>] that I definitely didn\u2019t write in a hurry with a hangover. There are no prizes.<br></p> \n  <p>If you\u2019re American, settle down for a fun few hours. If you\u2019re British, go to bed. Why are you even awake now? You\u2019ve got work tomorrow, and I don\u2019t want you getting sacked on my account.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-09T23:25:09.895Z\">at 11.25pm GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s finish up with a clip of Parasite winning best picture, and how the crowd reacted when the lights were cut. I think these might have been my favourite Oscars for years and years, you know. We\u2019ve got a great Phil Hoad piece here about what Parasite\u2019s win could mean for the future of the Oscars. Spoiler: good things. And here\u2019s a clip of the front row reacting when the Oscars prematurely cut Parasite\u2019s lights. Would anybody like to see the cast of Parasite jumping in slow motion? Another interesting statistic, for you. Bong Joon-ho is the new Disney. Here\u2019s the news piece on Parasite. And now the lights have gone down for good. The 92nd Oscars are over, and they have ended in the best possible way. This is Parasite\u2019s night. It\u2019s Bong Joon-ho\u2019s night. It is, to a slightly lesser extent, Eminem\u2019s night. I\u2019ll be sticking around for a little bit looking for reaction to the night, but I wouldn\u2019t blame you at all for ducking out. Thanks for keeping me company tonight. How metaphorical. They turned the lights out on the winners. Outrage rang out in the auditorium, and they forced the lights back up for more speeches. This is one turn-up after another. Well. What an amazing sweep. The most Oscars won tonight. The first film not in the English language to ever win best picture. Nobody on stage can believe it. The best film of the year won. This is stunning. Jane Fonda is here to present best picture, the final award of the night. If Parasite wins this, it\u2019ll be very exciting. And, as if by magic, here\u2019s the news story on the Zellweger win. And now, having mentioned every single member of the entire human race, dead or alive, by name, Zellweger can finally relax. Next year someone else will play a famous person in a film and win, and the wheel will turn on. Zellweger thanks her fellow nominees, and then seemingly every single person she has ever met in her entire life, and then Martin Scorsese and Bob Dylan and Neil Armstrong, and then people who wear uniforms, and then everyone else. And now for the best actress montage, which will last for ever. And here\u2019s the news story about Phoenix\u2019s win. And he uses his platform to make A Speech About Things. Today it is the environment and industrialised farming. But we\u2019re clever, he says, so we can change things. He ends the speech by remembering his brother, and gets sincerely choked up. It\u2019s a moment, for sure. I didn\u2019t account for the montages. So many montages. These Oscars will never be done. Olivia Colman steps up to present best actor. She is doing it in a very Olivia Colmanish way, so everyone\u2019s a winner. Here\u2019s the news story about Bong Joon-ho\u2019s best director victory. Now for the In Memoriam segment, as introduced by Steven Spielberg. Billie Eilish is singing Yesterday, by the way. Bong Joon-ho thanks Martin Scorsese, who gets a standing ovation of his own. He\u2019s thanking Quentin Tarantino, too, and Sam Mendes and Todd Phillips. And, again, he promises to drink. Bong Joon-ho wins best director. That\u2019s remarkable. This is his night, isn\u2019t it? He looks absolutely staggered. Here\u2019s Spike Lee to announce the best director winner. Oh, they won\u2019t. Elton John and Bernie Taupin win best original song. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t suck,\u201d says Taupin, who proceeds to do most of the talking. And then Elton takes over. Surely they won\u2019t play him off. Will they? Joker wins best score. And that\u2019s no surprise, since Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir has been spoken of as an almost real-time collaborator since before the film even came out. She seems like the least Jokerish person ever to walk the Earth, too, which only makes her achievement more remarkable. Here\u2019s Taika Waititi to talk about honorary awards. And not even he can liven up this thankless dog of a segment. But here\u2019s Sigourney Weaver, Gal Gadot and Brie Larson to announce a fight club. They also say, \u201cAll women are superheroes\u201d, which is factually incorrect but whatever. Here\u2019s a story about Parasite\u2019s latest win. And now for Elton John\u2019s performance. It\u2019s very much a late-era Elton John performance, in that he\u2019s shouting in such a way that I\u2019m not really able to tell you exactly how it goes. It\u2019s no Eminem. And Eminem was no Ray Romano. Parasite wins best international feature. Bong Joon-ho receives a standing ovation. He makes his film\u2019s cast and crew stand up. This might be the last award that Parasite wins, and he knows it. \u201cI\u2019m ready to drink,\u201d he says in English. Now for the category entitled best international feature named Parasite. Who\u2019ll win? Nobody knows. Sama from For Sama has been one of the highlights of awards season. She started to slap the podium during the Baftas and tonight? Tonight she\u2019s hiding under a table. Bombshell wins best makeup and hair. Kazu Hiro thanked Charlize Theron, and then one of his colleagues stepped up to the microphone, but they turned all the lights off and Charlize Theron looked really sad. What a rollercoaster. Ray Romano and Sandra Oh are here now, to present best hair and makeup. And Ray Romano said the F-word. Not even Eminem did that. Ray Romano is the new Eminem. 1917 wins best visual effects. Does this mean it\u2019s going to win best picture? Because if it does, could we just hand it out now and be done with it? Oh, they\u2019re dressed as Cats. And they\u2019re making jokes about the importance of visual effects. Pretty good. Now for Rebel Wilson and James Corden who\u2019d BETTER MAKE SOME CATS JOKES. Meanwhile, Cynthia Erivo is performing Stand Up. It\u2019s possibly the best performance of the night so far, but where are the cutaways of Brie Larson biting her lip and nodding her head? Nowhere, and that is why this song must not win. A whole room of people reacting to Eminem. I might stop following the Oscars and just embed these for the next two hours. And now here\u2019s the academy president to punch the wind out of everyone\u2019s sails. This is usually the bit where we all get told off for pirating films. But instead we get Tom Hanks talking about a museum. And that\u2019s better, I think. Ford v Ferrari wins best editing. There was talk earlier that Parasite winning this category would mean it would win best picture. But it hasn\u2019t, so now maybe it won\u2019t. Anyway, these two winners seem nice and happy. 1917 wins best cinematography. And that means that Roger Deakins wins, and this is the most thoroughly well deserved award. Roger Deakins might be the nicest, most normal person working in film. He\u2019s thanking his entire team \u2013 grips, gaffers, focus pullers \u2013 who don\u2019t usually get any love at shows like this. He\u2019s just a tremendous person. Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus are now pretending that they don\u2019t know what a cinematographer is. Oh no, what\u2019s happening now. A man I don\u2019t recognise is now recapping the entire ceremony utilising the medium of rap. I just checked, and I don\u2019t have a sphincter any more. It just straight-up disappeared all the way into my body. How am I supposed to poo now? The Oscars have prevented me from ever pooing again. Martin Scorsese reacts to Eminem. Just open my veins and pour this stuff into my heart. Another Eminem reaction \u2026 For reference for anyone not watching along, this is the face that Hollywood stars pull when they\u2019re dancing to Eminem. Imagine this a thousand times over. Now Randy Newman is singing that song from Toy Story 4. There are many, many fewer funny cutaways to this than there were when Eminem sang. 1917 wins best sound mixing. It might not be the only Oscar that 1917 wins tonight, but this might be one of the only incontestable categories. Ford v Ferrari wins best sound editing. So at least your dad will come away from this happy now. Donald Sylvester points out that this will probably be the last Oscar-winning film by 20th Century Fox, which is a weirdly sobering thought. To commemorate songs being in films, Eminem is now on stage singing that song of his about losing yourself. It\u2019s fine but \u2013 my God! \u2013 the cutaways of white people in the audience awkwardly bobbing their head is something else. It looks like they\u2019re all collectively trying to locate a specific dust speck. The memes this will inspire \u2026 Eminem got a standing ovation from the audience, who are well aware that their faces will now forever come up if anyone ever Googles the phrase \u201cAwkward white person biting lip and nodding GIFs\u201d. You know that bit where Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig sang about clothes? Here is video of them singing about clothes. Lin-Manuel Miranda is up to present a montage about films that have songs in them, which I think is probably all songs. If you need a wee, you\u2019ve probably got a good long time to go right now. And just like that, here\u2019s a news story on the thing that happened 10 seconds ago. Laura Dern wins best supporting actress. Of course she does. Everyone loves Laura Dern. She goes a bit wonky, by sort of drawing a line between Marriage Story (a film about two rich people flying from New York to Los Angeles and back over and over again) and environmentalism, but it\u2019s hard to deny her this moment. Dern is second only to Brad Pitt when it comes to internet sweethearts, and her win is well deserved. Mahershala Ali is here to present best supporting actress. Which means he\u2019s here to introduce a montage that will never end. Make yourselves comfortable, folks. And Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone (If You\u2019re a Girl) wins best documentary short. The heat is on now. The last guys were played off, and now a blueprint has been set. They\u2019re talking about the importance of teachers. And yet they make it out unscathed. What a soft touch. American Factory wins best documentary feature. The winners very graciously single out their fellow nominees, before talking about their film and the importance of unions. And, just like that, they\u2019re played off. The first one of the night! It took over an hour. The Oscars are getting lax. Now for best documentary feature. Mark Ruffalo (who introduces his own damn self) points out how many of the nominated films were directed or co-directed by woman. He\u2019s a very well chosen pick to introduce this category. And now Chrissy Metz is on stage singing I\u2019m Standing With You, a song that will absolutely not win best original song and probably wouldn\u2019t if it was the only nominated song. It sounds a bit like it was written by an algorithm called Vaguely Inspirational Things to Sing to Strangers at a Bus Stop. Little Women wins best costume design. Jacqueline Durran keeps it brief, which is a type of clothes. See? I can make clothes puns, too. Rudolph and Wiig sing a medley of songs about clothes. That sounded dry, but it was OK. Watch it on YouTube tomorrow. Go to bed now and watch it on YouTube tomorrow. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood wins best production design. Barbara Ling and Nancy Haigh both have an excellent eye for statement necklaces and their speech was over in the time it took me to write that. Oh, they\u2019re not really angry. They\u2019re pretending, because they\u2019re acting. And all this to announce the production design award. Here come Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig. They\u2019re pretending to be angry about something. While I wait to see what they\u2019re angry about, it\u2019s worth pointing out that Kristen Wiig is dressed as a kind of blood Viennetta. If a foreign-language film like Parasite can win best original screenplay, then does it mean it could win best picture? Wouldn\u2019t that be amazing? Should we all pin our hopes on that happening? Should we? I vote yes. The Neighbors\u2019 Window wins best live action short. Marshall Curry dedicates his award to storytellers in general, and that\u2019s about it. Jojo Rabbit wins best adapted screenplay. Taika Waititi seems genuinely overwhelmed by the win. Usually completely smooth at this sort thing, his voice is shaking. But what a one-two! I think the Oscars just got interesting. Bong Joon Ho flits between Korean and English in a speech that he was probably not expecting to make. They all look stunned. What a brilliant win. Parasite wins best original screenplay. And this is tremendous. What an achievement. The best film actually won. Here come the Oscars for writing. Kelly Marie Tran introduces Diane Keaton and Keanu Reeves, who sort of free associate for an hour and a half. Best original screenplay first. Here is Hair Love, by the way, in case you need something to help you through all these interminable ad breaks. The song is over. During the commercial break all the Elsas must fight each other with sharpened sticks to see who is the one true Elsa. It\u2019s a shame to be missing it, really, but commerce is commerce. The song is performed in Japanese, Polish, Thai, Castilian, German, Norwegian, Russian, Spanish and Danish. It is exactly \u2013 and I mean exactly \u2013 like a half-time Eurovision performance. I won\u2019t tell you whether that\u2019s a good or bad thing, though. Josh Gad comes on now (nobody introduces him) to introduce Idina Menzel and apparently everyone who has ever starred in any international version of Frozen for a performance of Into the Unknown from Frozen 2. Hair Love wins best animated short. They make a nice point about representation in animation, and it goes on slightly too long but they\u2019re not played off. This could be a dangerous precedent. Toy Story 4 wins best animated feature. Which is probably the film you\u2019d pick if you hadn\u2019t seen any of the others. The winners thank everyone they can as quickly as they can, because of all the time lost getting a presenter to introduce another presenter. Now for best animated feature. Beanie Feldstein just introduced Mindy Kaling. Is that how this is going to work without a host? A person announces a person who announces a winner? That seems like at least one step too many. We already have a news story about Brad Pitt winning. Not that anyone was expecting it or anything. And here comes the finely honed speech. There\u2019s a joke about John Bolton, and then a call for stunt performers to be recognised by the academy. Lots of sincerity, but no jokes. 6/10 speech. \u201cHow are they going to make up the time lost from not having a host?\u201d you\u2019re asking. The answer is \u201cincredibly long montages that take place before the nominations are announced\u201d. It\u2019s going to be a long night. Regina King is up next, presenting best supporting actor. Her speech is her just listing supporting actors she likes, which seems like a fairly novel way to postpone the foregone conclusion we\u2019re all expecting. That\u2019s it from the red carpet. Flash trends: metallic Jessica Rabbit dressing, as seen on ScarJo. Power sleeves. A soup\u00e7on of sustainability. There were serious fashion statements, from Spike Lee and Nathalie Portman, and a pair of alarming pockets. Till next year! Steve Martin and Chris Rock are up next, not really hosting (although they have both hosted before), but doing a vaguely monologuey thing. Now she\u2019s making Brie Larson go, \u201cLa la la.\u201d Now she\u2019s lying on the floor. This is like that time the guy who operated the fireworks display pressed the wrong button and set all the fireworks off at the same time. Like this \u2026 In the time it took me to write that, she changed into a Midsommar outfit. I think Janelle Mon\u00e1e just gave me a nosebleed. She\u2019s in the audience already, singing straight at Tom Hanks. And now, for the second part of this medley, she\u2019s singing a rewritten version of Come Alive that references all the films that have been nominated this year. And for the third part she\u2019s singing I\u2019m Still Standing with Billy Porter. And for the fourth part she\u2019s singing Come Alive again. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that it\u2019s a lot. And here we go. Janelle Monae is the first woman we see onscreen, singing the theme tune to Mr Rogers. Obviously, I am as in love with Brad Pitt as the next person. But he is not giving me much to say about his lewk. It\u2019s another \u201cBrad Pitt looks handsome in classic tuxedo\u201d shocker. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t choose it himself, just as he probably doesn\u2019t write his own speeches. But that smize is all his own. Charlize Theron in custom-made Dior is going for full-on goddess vibes here: single shoulder-baring dress (no one say \u201cTracy Brabin\u201d) and full-on party leg. A definite highlight. This is your 10-minute warning. The Oscars start in 10 minutes. Americans: go to the toilet. Brits: go to bed. You\u2019ll smash through the YouTube clips in about 20 minutes tomorrow morning. Sure the mullet needs a bit of a trim, but Brad Pitt in Bironi is the most Brad Pitt-ish look we\u2019ve had on the red carpet this season. Translation: he knows he\u2019s going to take home that statuette. What you can\u2019t quite see here is that Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet \u2013 one of a new guard of men actually not looking boring on the red carpet \u2013 is wearing quite a punchy outfit. A sort of workwear-shaped jacket, rather than a tux or a suit, which the internet says makes him look as though he works in valet parking. Oh, pfft, internet, it\u2019s fashion. And Margot Robbie likes it. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino: two absolute legends looking as if they are claiming Big Magician Style and owning it on the red carpet. Pacino also continuing a trend from tonight (black-on-black suit dressing). Extremely into this as a fashion statement: Natalie Portman has embroidered the names of female directors who weren\u2019t nominated tonight on her cape. Those names are Scafaria, Wang, Gerwig, Diop, Heller, Matsoukas, Ha\u2019rel, Sciamma. NB: Wang was surprise winner for best picture at the Spirit awards last night. Grease 2 x Frank Ocean wearing Prada at the Met Gala x A Bronx Tale = Timoth\u00e9e you are blowing our minds. The E! coverage has just ended in the UK, by the way. Usually at this point we get to watch Alex Zane in a basement for half an hour. But this time \u2013 this time! \u2013 we get to watch Alex Zane on a hotel roof for half an hour. Plus \u00e7a change. This is what is known as taking-up-space dressing: Cynthia Erivo\u2019s panniered look is superhero at the top and Marie Antoinette at the bottom. And will Cynthia Erivo\u2019s left leg be the new Angelina\u2019s right leg by the morning? Only time will tell. The E! fashion panel have all just dropped their jaws because the fashion game this year is next level. I just thought you might like to know that. Amy and Jo have arrived after one another. Sorry, we mean Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh ... Ronan has bravely chosen tonight to debut her new bangs and has gone even more experimental with her Gucci dress, which looks like two dresses in one. How will Timmy C top this?! People on Twitter are asking Florence Pugh to \u201cstep on them\u201d, which I think means that they like this dress. It\u2019s by Louis Vuitton and is very Chrysler building. There are currently two (two!) cast members from the feature film Cats on screen on E! at the same time. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m terrified that they\u2019ll rip all their skin off and then eat a mouse that screams like a child. Natalie Portman has embroidered her cape with the names of female directors who weren\u2019t nominated. Now there\u2019s a woman who wants people to really squint at a cape. Here\u2019s the dress with see-through pockets, as described by Stuart Heritage, below. I\u2019d like to offer a fashion explanation, but I can\u2019t. Her hands must be warm? Maya Rudolph looks great with her new bob haircut and copper coloured kaftan, which, damn, looks comfier than the sweat pants from 1997 we are currently wearing as we type this ... Geena Davis has turned up in a dress with pockets. Everyone seems very happy about this, except it needs to be pointed out that her pockets are transparent. When she puts her hands in her pockets, you can see her hands. That, quite frankly, is not what pockets are for. Can you imagine walking around with everyone seeing all the crap you carry around in your pockets? I just did a quick pocket audit and, if I pulled that in Geena Davis\u2019 dress, everyone would have a very clear view of a snot-encrusted Kleenex. Funniest speech at the Baftas, best dressed at the Oscars? Twitter has a lot of time for this Jason Wu look from Rebel Wilson. More importantly, her hair is Veronica Lake\u2019s waves with Courtney Love\u2019s roots, a winning reference I am taking with me for my next hair appointment. Will Parasite sweep the Oscars? Who knows? Will we be doing Gerard Butler\u2019s red carpet pose tomorrow morning as we point out the leaks in our boiler to our landlord? 100%. Quite Villanelle, isn\u2019t it, this frothy confection of a frock from Sandra Oh? And it makes a major case for the gargantuan sleeve as the stand-out trend of the 2020 awards season. I hope I don\u2019t get sacked for this, but the red carpet is really boring. So, instead, here\u2019s some of the Oscars writing I\u2019ve enjoyed this week: Alexis Petridis ranked the best original Oscar songs A case for a best casting category Peter Bradshaw\u2019s final predictions And also I went to the Baftas and got annoyed by all the selfies Best dressed officially called \u2026 Things we\u2019re going to regret tomorrow: a) how much time we wasted wondering how Blac Chyna got an invite b) how much time we wasted thinking about the audience reaction to Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s speech c) how much we wished we were Greta Gerwig (in custom Dior) and Noah Baumbach \u2013 who tonight look very \u201cdate night couple goals\u201d. E! just asked Oscar Isaac to paint a picture of the red carpet. Do they ... do they not know that they\u2019re on television? Do they spend their entire lives doling out this sort of high-frequency enthusiasm? They must be so exhausted. Olivia Colman has a thing about regal sleeves. She wore huge Henry VIII ones at the Golden Globes, now she\u2019s wearing puffy teardrop-shaped arm eruptions with a floor-sweeping cape. If there is a subliminal message here I feel it is: I AM THE QUEEN, you know. Bow down. Classic Almod\u00f3var: very \u201cI\u2019m Your Man-era Leonard Cohen tribute gig\u201d. Anything with a polo neck and shades gets the double thumbs-up from us. Part Grace Jones, part can\u2019t-get-you-out-of-my-head Kylie, part medieval knight, part cyborg, Janelle Mon\u00e1e is one of the leading lights of the modern red carpet. This ensemble is by Ralph Lauren. Mindy Kaling is talking to Ryan Seacrest now. She claimed that she was being tailed by a bodyguard who has been specifically hired to protect her necklace. Ryan Seacrest asked where he was. She couldn\u2019t locate him. That necklace is getting nicked is what I\u2019m saying. An update from our man on the actual red carpet: Westboro Baptist Church are back. And there\u2019s a plane calling for an Alita sequel. Eco fashion klaxon: Booksmart\u2019s Kaitlyn Dever tells the red carpet interviewers that she is wearing a \u201ccompletely sustainable dress by Louis Vuitton\u201d. Apparently, it\u2019s made from tencel. It also looks quite Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. There aren\u2019t enough red carpet dresses inspired by lampshades. Here, Laura Dern wears one that is - in the best possible way. She looks as awesome as her Marriage Story character is terrifying. Win. Billie Eilish in head-to-toe custom-made Chanel, an updo and killer nails. And by \u2018killer\u2019 we mean: she\u2019d find it hard to open a can of tuna but could probably slay you from 20 metres away. There had been rumours that Billie Eilish was going to debut her forthcoming Bond theme during tonight\u2019s ceremony. However, that isn\u2019t going to be the case. Instead, she\u2019ll be performing during the In Memoriam section. And she definitely can\u2019t do the Bond theme for that, because you don\u2019t want to be singing a song called No Time to Die underneath a massive picture of Kirk Douglas. Instead, she\u2019ll be covering \u2018a song I\u2019ve always loved\u2019. Please, place your bets in the comments. Nominating Billy Porter\u2019s platform heel for 2021\u2019s best supporting actor ... In \u2018This will go viral in the morning\u2019 news: an early shoe win for Frozen 2 songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez \u2013 a kooky nod to the fact she writes songs for animated films. Spike Lee pays tribute to Kobe Bryant in this purple and gold number, with \u201824\u2019 printed on the lapels. Possibly the first of many outfits that will deliver a message this evening. The E! red carpet panelists have congratulated Regina King on graduating from strapless dresses last year to dresses with one strap this year. I hope this pattern continues. Two straps next year. Three in 2022. Ten years from now she\u2019ll have to crawl up the red carpet, broken and crying from the sheer weight of straps that she\u2019s graduated to, and the E! red carpet panelists will explode in a cloud of hormones. Sigourney Weaver looks classic in emerald Dior. We\u2019re loving the rope belt feature and the tiny clutch bag possibly featuring the secrets for Avatar 2, Avatar 3 and Avatar 4 in it. Diane Warren is on the red carpet now. She\u2019s nominated for a song called I\u2019m Standing With You, and now she\u2019s standing with a woman who just said, \u201cI\u2019m standing with you\u201d out loud to Diane Warren. It doesn\u2019t speak well of my chances tonight that this has blown my mind. And speaking of Julia Butters, she\u2019s literally brought a packed lunch with her. Fear her, for she is the wisest woman in this circus. The red carpet show isn\u2019t exactly big on revelations \u2013 I just heard one woman ask a guest, \u201cHow does it feel to live in the hearts of millions of people?\u201d \u2013 but I think I just heard Questlove say that he was going to DJ during the ceremony. Will there be a DJ instead of an orchestra? What will he chose to drop during the In Memoriam section? Will this be the first How Do You Do Fellow Kids Oscars? Julia Butters is the breakout star of Once Upon a Time In Hollywood. She is 10 years old and she is swathed in OTT pink frills by Christian Sirano. I won\u2019t make a Butters-wouldn\u2019t-melt joke, but I will say that she looks pretty adorable. Billy Porter continues his OMG-moments on the red carpet by dressing like ... an Oscar! Tonight he has mixed a sleeveless top with gold feathers with a floor-length skirt featuring a bold orange print and was styled by Sam Ratelle. It might be raining on the red carpet and you\u2019re going to wake up tomorrow with a sore head thinking, \u2018But Ford v Ferrari looked terrible\u2019 but don\u2019t worry: there\u2019s always Regina King who looks resplendent in this fitted pale pink number. It begins! The red carpet is open. We, Hannah Marriott and Priya Elan of Guardian Fashion, are here to guide you through it. Memes will be made. Trends will be born. Lucrative contractual obligations will be fulfilled. Billy Porter will be awesome. And will any of Hollywood\u2019s climate activists bother with sustainable fashion? Who knows! Exciting, isn\u2019t it? Stay tuned for the next couple of hours. Good evening world, and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s liveblog of the 2019 Oscars. Tonight marks the end of a long and gruelling awards season, full of snubs (Uncut Gems, Midsommar, people who aren\u2019t white men) and dangerously low on surprises. If the other awards this year have taught us anything, it\u2019s that Brad Pitt will win best supporting actor and charm us with a suspiciously funny speech; and that Joaquin Phoenix will win best actor and shout at us like an especially hungover supply teacher. There\u2019s still a question mark hovering over the recipient of best picture \u2013 although many suggest that 1917 will nose it \u2013 but aside from that, this might well be the Oscars on autopilot. But you\u2019re not here to see who wins an Oscar, are you? You\u2019re here because for some reason you really, really like reading liveblogs of American award ceremonies as written by a tired British person in a different time zone. So let me tell you what\u2019s going to happen this evening. For the next two hours, I\u2019ll be following the (uncharacteristically soggy) red carpet action with help from the very talented Guardian fashion team. As a word of advice, I\u2019ll be watching and commenting the E! red carpet show (on the Sky Oscars channel in the UK) \u2013 which from memory is like getting a concussion and then receiving a Red Bull enema \u2013 so try to watch it along with me, unless you perversely enjoy attempting to decode dozens and dozens of context-dependent semi-jokes for hours on end. And once that\u2019s done, the real fun will begin. The 92nd Academy Awards kick off at 1am GMT and, if previous years are any indication, will grind on obliviously until the heat death of the universe. It will be exhausting and dispiriting, but at least we have our entire, amazing film desk on hand throughout the night for reaction and analysis. In the meantime, here\u2019s the annual Oscars bingo card [try here for a bigger version] that I definitely didn\u2019t write in a hurry with a hangover. There are no prizes. If you\u2019re American, settle down for a fun few hours. If you\u2019re British, go to bed. Why are you even awake now? You\u2019ve got work tomorrow, and I don\u2019t want you getting sacked on my account.",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m full of so much gratitude now.

These came following Wall Street\u2019s struggles on Friday where the Dow fell 0.9% and, the S&amp;P 500 declined 0.5% in what will likely see markets follow a similar trend this week, unless Beijing makes any concrete announcements that the coronavirus has been contained.</p> <p>It is clear that markets will remain sensitive to any coronavirus-related headlines.

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap Coronavirus fears continue to weigh on the financial markets, as supply chains are hit by factory closures and consumers face higher prices in the shops. Stocks are down in Europe and the US today, following losses in most of Asia. The FTSE 100 is currently down 30 points, or 0.4%, with travel companies and hotel operators among the fallers. The French CAC and German DAX are also down almost 0.5%. Although Chinese workers were due back at work today, many factories, shops and offices are still closed. LG, Samsung and Foxconn, for example, have all been forced to keep manufacturing sites closer. This has led analysts to predict that global smartphone production could slide by over 10% this quarter, with many Chinese assembly lines gathering dust. The crisis has also hit market confidence; Sentix\u2019s survey of investor morale has fallen this month, on fears that global growth will be hit. President Xi Jinping has tried to calm the situation, pledging that large-scale layoffs will be avoided. But families are already being hit in the pocket; Chinese inflation has hit an eight year high today, partly due to supply shortages and stockpiling. Last year\u2019s swine fever epidemic, which has driven pork price up by over 100%, is another factor. Wall Street has opened lower, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing 75 points or 0.25%. That adds to losses on Friday, which unwound some of the recovery seen last week after heavy losses on Monday. Rupert Thompson, Chief Investment Officer at Kingswood, predicts more volatility as the cost of the coronavirus becomes clearer: Chinese growth looks set to slow sharply in the first quarter and global growth is also likely to weaken significantly. However, the important point is that this disruption is expected to be only temporary, with activity bouncing back in the second and third quarters. This was certainly the experience of previous health scares. This time, the backdrop of improving business confidence should increase the ability of the global economy to withstand the hit from the virus. Even so, it will be a few weeks before it becomes evident that the virus really is under control, and a few months before the global economic recovery has clearly managed to ride out the disruption. We anticipate further market volatility during this period of uncertainty and we are not looking for global equities to sustain a break higher for a while yet. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has seized on the coronavirus crisis to renew calls for US companies to shift factories back to America. Speaking on Fox News today, Navarro argued that the supply chain disruption shows that more pharmaceutical and medical manufacturing should be brought back to the US. Navarro also told Fox Business that it\u2019s too early to assess the impact on the US economy. \u201cI think we are going to have to wait another couple of weeks or a month to see just what exactly is going on. \u201cThere\u2019s also companies that are going back to work in China as we speak. We won\u2019t know for a couple of weeks now whether the virus is going to peak or whether it\u2019s going to spread.\u201d Wall Street is heading for a rather dull open in an hour\u2019s time. The main indices are flat in the futures market, with coronavirus worries weighing on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs have predicted that the impact on the global economy, and company profits, will be \u201climited\u201d, telling clients: The impact of the lower global and U.S. economic activity on 2020 S&amp;P 500 earnings per share will be limited. \u201cInvestors who believe the economic consequences of the coronavirus will be limited should increase exposure to cyclicals and value stocks.\u201d But Brad Betchel of Jefferies points out that we simply don\u2019t know how the Chinese economy will react. Even if supply chains rebound quickly, firms may not recover lost business. We start out with a slew of headlines indicating that factories and businesses in several regions around China are reopening after their extended holiday. Some municipalities seem to be advising factories to remain shut and employees to remain at home but otherwise the bulk of the headlines have been about reopening. We will see if this sustains and if the supply chain shock that we have all been worried about is just a temporary set back as we get things back on track. The question would become, are we going to see a \u2018v\u2019shaped recovery as pent up demand catches up or did we lose a lot of production that will not come back? That is assuming of course that the virus is contained and that still remains to be seen. Mihir Kapadia, the CEO of Sun Global Investments, says the rising death toll is worrying investors: \u201cAsian markets have continued their slide as the death toll from the coronavirus has exceeded the SARS epidemic, which is raising concerns that the virus growing more serious. With 908 now dead in China, and the possibility of it reaching 1,000 in just a few days, Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.7% to record a second day of losses while Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 0.8% and Australian shares dropped 0.5%. These came following Wall Street\u2019s struggles on Friday where the Dow fell 0.9% and, the S&amp;P 500 declined 0.5% in what will likely see markets follow a similar trend this week, unless Beijing makes any concrete announcements that the coronavirus has been contained. It is clear that markets will remain sensitive to any coronavirus-related headlines. Although we are currently seeing relatively stable markets, any significantly worse news on the virus could lead to further significant declines in global indices. Precious metal prices are up this morning, China\u2019s state TV is reporting that president Xi Jinping has pledged to prevent the large-scale layoff of workers, due to economic disruption caused by the coronavirus. Xi, who visited a hospital treating patients from the outbreak today, warned that the situation was \u201cstill severe\u201d, but pledged that China would win the battle. He pledged that states will take \u201cmore decisive measures\u201d to combat the virus, and to restrict the dangers of rising infections as people return to work this week. On the economic front, Xi insisted that the \u201clong-term improving momentum\u201d of China\u2019s economy hasn\u2019t changed -- perhaps brushing over the fact that growth hit a 30-year low last year. Economic \u201cadjustments\u201d will be made to minimise the impact of the coronavirus, he added, as Beijing strives to hit its economic and social targets for 2020. The coronavirus has already had a major impact on Mobile World Congress, the huge mobile phone conference held in Barcelona each year. Some big names have pulled out of the show, including Sony, Amazon, Nvidia, LG and Ericsson. They want to avoid their executives potentially becoming infected as they mingled at the trade stands or hold business meetings. But this is another sign that the coronavirus could have a long-term impact on the global economy -- fewer deals and connections will be made at MWC, which could lead to less innovation and new products down the line. Reuters is reporting that Nissan are suspending production at a car factory in Kyushu, in Japan, due to the coronavirus. The Kyushu factory manufactures Nissan\u2019s X-Trail SUV, and this is a sign that the virus is hurting global supply chains. Last month Nissan suspended work at its Chinese factories, including joint ventures in the Wuhan area. Other carmakers took similar moves, and they now seem to be having a knock-on impact. South Korean car maker Hyundai was force to close all its car factories in South Korea after running out of components from China. It\u2019s official: The coronavirus outbreak has hurt investor confidence across Europe. Eurozone investor morale has fallen for the first time in four months, according to research group Sentix. It blames fears that the coronavirus will have a serious impact on the global economy. Sentix chief Manfred Huebner explains: While at the beginning of the year there was still a clear upswing scenario for the global economy, the outbreak of the coronavirus in China has changed the situation significantly. The drastic measures taken by the Chinese government for the Hubei region show the danger to the global economy if the outbreak cannot be limited regionally Sentix\u2019s euro-area confidence measure dropped to 5.2 in February, from 7.6 in January. That\u2019s still higher than last autumn, when the index was dragged in negative territory by trade war fears. But there could be worse ahead. Currently, most investors are hopeful that the economic damage from coronavirus can be confined to China (which may be optimistic, given the number of major companies affected). So morale could keep falling, if more cases are diagnosed around the globe. As Huebner puts it: \u201cThe outbreak of the coronavirus and the subsequent drastic measures taken by the Chinese government cast a shadow over the economic outlook. Fortunately, so far the effect is limited.\u201d \u201cHowever, in view of the significant declines in Chinese economic data, it is clear that the negative effect is likely to be much greater if it does not become apparent in the coming days that the spread of the virus has been taken away.\u201d The coronavirus crisis could slash global smartphone production by 12% this quarter, according to a new analyst report. Trendforce has predicted that just 275 million smartphones will be made in January-March, down from around 310m in Q1 2019. Apple\u2019s production will fall 10%, it estimates, while Huawei will be 15% lower. Trendforce says: \u201cDelayed resumption work and uncertainties in employees\u2019 returns will cause the monthly delivery of key components to be postponed, thus affecting the progress of smartphone production.\u201d The coronavirus outbreak has already forced smartphone factories across China to shutdown. Foxconn, which manufacturers iPhones, has been forced to abandon plans to reopen plants today. According to Nikkei business daily, government officials feared that Foxconn\u2019s factories have a \u201chigh risk of coronavirus infection\u201d, due to poor airflow and central heating systems. Apple temporarily closing its 42 stores in mainland China earlier this month, which will inevitably hurt sales. Separately, research firm Canalys predicted that sales of smartphones in China could HALVE this quarter, as many retail shops are closed and production has been hit. They warned: \u201cVendors\u2019 planned product launches will be canceled or delayed, given that large public events are not allowed in China. \u201cIt will take time for vendors to change their product launch roadmaps in China, which is likely to dampen 5G shipments.\u201d Back in the City, shares in hotel firms and airlines are among the fallers - on fears that the coronavirus outbreak will hurt the tourism industry. Ireland\u2019s stock market has slumped by 1.25% in early trading after a seismic general election result created political deadlock. Bank shares are leading the rout, down over 5%, after Sinn F\u00e9in smashed the dominance of Fine Gail and Fianna F\u00e1il. Sinn F\u00e9in appears to have won the most first preference votes, as voters flocked to its progressive policy platform including tackling Ireland\u2019s housing crisis, supporting lower-paid workers and cut childcare costs -- and to push for a \u2018unity referendum\u2019 on a united Ireland. Coalition talks could take several days, or longer, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar ruling out an agreement between his Fine Gail party and Sinn F\u00e9in. Ouch! Italian factory production has slumped much more than expected, in a worrying signal for the eurozone economy. Italy\u2019s manufacturing output slumped by 2.7% month-on-month in December, matching similar declines in France and Germany. Economists had only expected a 0.5% drop. We already knew that Italy\u2019s economy shrank in October-December, and today\u2019s figures underline its weakness. Over in Germany, a major political story is breaking. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer is stepping down as leader of the governing CDU party, dashing expectations that she would run to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor. This throws the race to replace Merkel wide open, with significant implications for the eurozone. AKK\u2019s decision follows a political crisis over local elections in the small state of Thuringia, where CDU deputies teamed up with the far-right Alternative for Germany party. AKK had pleaded with party members not to work with AfD, but was ignored, undermining her authority as party leader. Although the Lunar New Year break has ended today, there are clear signs that China\u2019s economy isn\u2019t getting back to normal yet. Electronics manufacturer LG has reported that three of its factories, in Hangzhou, Tianjin and Qinhuangdao, are all closed as it seeks permission from local government officials to reopen. Samsung says its TVC factory in Tianjin will remain closed until next Monday, in line with official guidelines. Metal prices are rising this morning, on concerns that the coronavirus outbreak could hurt supplies. Copper has gained 0.8% this morning, while nickel is up 2%, zinc is 1.6% higher and tin is up 1.8%. There are concerns that China\u2019s metal output will fall sharply this quarter (as so many factories have been shuttered), as Reuters explained: \u201cBefore the price consolidation, the main concern was demand destruction due to China\u2019s economic slowdown and lockdown, but as the situation develops, it seems that supply is also disrupted,\u201d said analyst Helen Lau of Argonaut Securities. European stock markets have started the new week by dropping into the red. The FTSE 100 is down 26 points, or 0.35%, while the broader Stoxx 600 index has lost 0.25%. Investors are trying to assess the economic damage from the coronavirus, and its impact on global supply chains as (some) Chinese workers head back to the office or factory. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says: New cases in China are stabilising but it\u2019s now more deadly than SARS was. What\u2019s still unknown is the real economic damage this has wrought. Markets will continue to find support from ample liquidity delivered by willing central banks and the buy-the-dip mentality lives on. An explosion of cases in London or New York could spook traders still\u2026the UK government calls the coronavirus a \u2018serious and imminent threat\u2019 to public health. Most Asia-Pacific stock markets have dipped today, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s KOSPI both losing 0.6%. Japan fell 0.7%. China\u2019s markets rose, though, up around 0.5% on relief that some employees returned to their workplaces today. The CSI 300 index closed at 3,916, having been trading over 4,200 in mid-January before the coronavirus crisis. China\u2019s inflation rate is likely to remain high for months, warns Nomura analysts, as the coronavirus hits supplies and encourages families to stockpile goods. They told clients: We believe the coronavirus outbreak may keep CPI inflation above 4 percent (year on year) in the first half of 2020 due both to hoarding by households (e.g, food and other supplies), disruptions to transport and supply shocks as a result of those lockdowns,\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The coronavirus crisis continues to weigh on global markets. As the death toll steadily rises, new cases are reported around the world and factories across China remain closed -- leaving economists struggling to assess the impact on the global economy. Today we have new evidence that the outbreak is pushing up prices in China. Chinese inflation has jumped to an eight-year high, climbing to 5.4% per annum in January from 4.5% in December. It appears that the coronavirus is one factor, as households scramble to stock up on essential items, and medical items like face masks and disinfectants. China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said the jump in inflation was partly due to to the Lunar New Year holiday and the coronavirus outbreak. It reported that Hubei province, which has been hit hardest by the coronavirus outbreak, saw a 5.5% jump in consumer inflation, slightly over the national average. That implies that the measures imposed to curb the crisis could be hitting supplies, and thus creating inflationary pressures. Prices across China jumped by 1.4% in January alone -- a sharp rise, which may be partly due to the Lunar New Year (the scramble to get home and buy presents often pushes up costs). Food prices have jumped by over 20% in the last year, partly due to pork prices which surged by 116% year-on-year in January. China has been forced to slaughter hundreds of millions of pigs following the swine fever outbreak last year, leading to a chronic shortage of pork. Non-food prices rose 1.6% in January from a year earlier, picking up from a 1.3% increase in December. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says these three factors all pushed inflation to its highest since 2011: A mix bag of higher pork prices, stronger Chinese New Year demand and the coronavirus outbreak pushed the Chinese inflation to the highest level in more than eight years. The surge in inflation revived worries that the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) would have less freedom to ease its monetary policy to give support to the Chinese economy hit by the coronavirus outbreak, following more than a year-and-a-half long trade frictions with the US. The latest word is that over 900 people have died from the virus which first appeared in Wuhan in December, with 40,171 infected cases. And in the last few minutes, the UK government has declared on Monday that the new coronavirus was a serious and imminent threat to public health. Chinese workers had been expected to return to work today after the extended New year break. But with schools and many factories closed, many people will remain at home. Global stock markets are expected to dip today, after the The head of the World Health Organization warned that we could only be seeing the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019 of coronavirus cases. Also coming up today Sentix\u2019s survey of investor morale, due this morning, could show that the coronavirus crisis has hurt morale. New factory data from Italy is expected to drop in output, as Europe\u2019s manufacturing woes continue. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Last week there were dreadful industrial production reports from German and France as they showed a fall of 3.5% and 2.8% respectively. The industrial output isn\u2019t the most influential update, but at the same time a very disappointing update will be remembered by traders. The agenda 9am GMT: Italian industrial production figures for December; output expected to fall by 0.5% 9.30am GMT: Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence; expected to drop to 5.9 from 7.6",

      "bodyText": "MI5 has been ordered by a senior judge not to delete vast databanks of personal information it is storing pending the outcome of a trial over the legality of its surveillance procedures. Lord Justice Singh, the president of the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT), delivered a sharp rebuke to lawyers for MI5 who questioned the feasibility of his legal directive. \u201cThis is an order of a judicial tribunal,\u201d Singh said. \u201cIf it turns out the respondents [MI5] have breached the orders of the tribunal that will have consequences.\u201d The IPT hears complaints about the operation of the intelligence services. The sharp exchange between the judge and MI5\u2019s lawyers came at the end of an opening hearing into a joint-claim by the human rights groups Liberty and Privacy International. Both have called for interception warrants obtained unlawfully by MI5 to be quashed. The case is an attempt to establish the extent of internal failures \u2013 admitted last year by MI5 \u2013 over the way the Security Service captures, processes, stores and uses the bulk interceptions of data acquired through surveillance and hacking programmes. MI5 has a duty to ensure such material is held no longer than required or copied more often than needed. It has been accused of operating \u201cungoverned spaces\u201d where such regulatory duties were routinely ignored. Previous IPT judgments may even need to be reopened, the tribunal was told on Monday by Daniel Cashman, representing Liberty and Privacy International. This was because MI5 had \u201cbreached it duty of candour\u201d to the home secretary, the high court and the tribunal, Cashman added. In a written claim submitted to the tribunal, Privacy International and Liberty said: \u201cMI5 appears to have led ministers, the investigatory powers commissioners and judicial commissioners to grant warrants \u2026 on a false basis as to its arrangements for the retention, review and destruction of personal data obtained by bulk and other means over an extended period.\u201d That illegality may stretch back as far as 2010, according to the claim form. \u201cThere have been significant intrusions into individuals\u2019 privacy, contrary to domestic law and without any justification, at a systematic level due to the creation and continued use, over a significant period, of inadequate systems for data retention, management and destruction,\u201d it added. Even though the claim was lodged on 31 January, Singh said EU law may no longer apply to the dispute. The judge said the question of whether any past court or tribunal judgments need to be reopened should be stayed until after the claim has been concluded. But he ordered that MI5 should preserve evidence of any wrongdoing in its computers. Andrew O\u2019Connor QC, representing MI5, said there was already a \u201cremediation process\u201d going on in the agency that involved \u201cthe deletion of material that should not be there\u201d. Any order from the tribunal, he said, \u201crequiring Thames House [MI5\u2019s London headquarters] to put a freeze on any deletions would be in contradiction of a process agreed with the investigatory powers commissioner\u201d. O\u2019Connor said he would need to take instructions from the Security Service and may need to make fresh representations to the IPT. \u201cThis is not something can halt by making a phone call,\u201d he added.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cEvery little bit of hate just gees me on to do better and prove them all wrong,\u201d Fallon Sherrock says with quiet calm as she explains how the abuse she has suffered online helped her to make history as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/17/fallon-sherrock-makes-history-pdc-world-darts-first-woman-win-ted-evetts\" title=\"\">first woman to win a match at the PDC world darts championship</a> in December. \u201cIt made me a stronger person, and more determined. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d still be as strong if I didn\u2019t have all that hate. I needed hate to make me more determined.\u201d</p> <p>It seems the best and most coherent way of dealing with the epidemic of hate, especially towards women, that infects social media. Sherrock not only won two matches in the world championship but on Thursday in Nottingham she will <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/darts/50968914\" title=\"\">become the first woman to play Premier League darts</a>.</p> <p>She has also been exalted on social media, with plaudits for her sporting breakthrough ranging from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillieJeanKing/status/1208525605731389441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1208525605731389441&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2F2019%2Fdec%2F21%2Ffallon-sherrock-beats-mensur-suljovic-pdc-world-darts-championship\" title=\"\">tweets by Billie Jean King</a> to Instagram posts by Sarah Jessica Parker who wrote of Sherrock: \u201cMaking history and our hearts stop as <a href=\"https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/sherrock-craze-unprecedented/175582\" title=\"\">we watched in astonishment and awe</a>.\u201d But, after 45 minutes in Sherrock\u2019s company, it is plain that bleak misogyny has fired her determination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/lisa-ashton-dont-want-special-treatment-women-darts-pdc-mens-tour\">Lisa Ashton: \u2018I don\u2019t want special treatment as the first woman on the men\u2019s darts tour\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It stretches back to the time, more than five years ago, when Sherrock fell ill soon after giving birth to her son. A mysterious kidney ailment caused her face to become bloated. She kept playing darts despite the wounding comments made about her appearance \u2013 just as she keeps on when she is vilified for daring to play professional darts against men.</p> <p>Sherrock raises a wry eyebrow over her glasses, and taps her long painted fingernails patiently on the table, when I ask if online hate continues alongside the delight accompanying her world championship success. \u201cYeah. You\u2019re always going to get hate. Obviously no one says anything to me, but it\u2019s different online. People just hide behind the computer at home.\u201d</p> <p>But she uses that hate? \u201cDefinitely. If I\u2019m feeling a bit slouchy, I\u2019ll look at some of the comments and I\u2019ll be like: \u2018OK, now I need to prove you wrong.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sherrock also points out that she has not had to do this since the world championship. \u201cI\u2019ve not been slouchy this year at all. A few years back I got complacent. That\u2019s when I needed to fire myself up. Now if I see any of the bad comments I go past them. Or my management team takes it away so I don\u2019t have to look at it. In the past I used to take it to heart. It made me stronger and more determined to prove everyone wrong. But if I hadn\u2019t been strong\u2011minded I could have buckled from all the nasty comments.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ceec2aa3fd61ceae4ab969bb43f85601400af36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ceec2aa3fd61ceae4ab969bb43f85601400af36/0_240_4300_2580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fallon Sherrock in the media spotlight after winning against Ted Evetts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fallon Sherrock in the media spotlight after winning against Ted Evetts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does she ever confront the trolls online? \u201cI\u2019ve not been tempted to call anyone out because most of them making comments don\u2019t play darts. So they don\u2019t understand anything. And those just trying to be nasty need to be ignored. If I react it\u2019s giving them fuel and I\u2019m not that type of person. If I start commenting back, I\u2019d be as bad as them. Anyway, if you just wondered what everyone thought all the time you wouldn\u2019t achieve anything.\u201d</p> <p>Sherrock achieved a memorable and historic feat when she beat Ted Evetts in the opening round of the world championship. She was one of two women who had battled through the qualifiers to reach the main draw. Mikuru Suzuki played James Richardson a few days before Sherrock\u2019s debut. Suzuki came close to becoming the first woman to win a match at the world championship <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/15/darts-womens-champion-suzuki-denied-pdc\" title=\"\">but she lost 3-2</a>. \u201cI watched it at home and I was egging Mikuru on to win,\u201d Sherrock says. \u201cShe missed out by a few darts. But that definitely inspired me. I\u2019d never had the opportunity to prove myself before but I knew I had the game to beat Ted.\u201d</p> <p>As the match unfolded was she conscious of the crowd\u2019s support for her? \u201cDefinitely. It made me feel so comfortable and confident. I know it sounds ridiculous, because there were so many people, but I felt so calm up there. I didn\u2019t feel nervous at all. But once I\u2019d won I was overwhelmed and didn\u2019t know if I wanted to cry or jump around. I was so happy and excited.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the past a lot of people would go: \u2018We\u2019re playing a woman.\u2019 But now they\u2019re thinking: \u2018We\u2019re playing a good player\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sherrock\u2019s victory unleashed so many tributes that, once again, she felt swamped by an intense mix of emotions. \u201cWhen Billie Jean King started tweeting messages to me I was like: \u2018Wow, this amazing person\u2019s actually contacted me.\u2019 I\u2019m just a normal girl from Milton Keynes. This stuff doesn\u2019t happen to people like me. And then it was the Instagram post from Sarah Jessica Parker. I watched Sex and the City so that was amazing as well. To have two massive people contact me was incredible. I was like: \u2018Fallon, don\u2019t get too carried away. Just put it to one side and you can come back and stare at it later.\u2019 I focused on what I had to do.\u201d</p> <p>In the second round she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/21/fallon-sherrock-beats-mensur-suljovic-pdc-world-darts-championship\" title=\"\">beat </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/21/fallon-sherrock-beats-mensur-suljovic-pdc-world-darts-championship\" title=\"\">Mensur Suljovic</a>. Sherrock\u2019s face lights up at the memory. \u201cIt was such a privilege to play Mensur. He was the 11th best player in the world and I see him on TV all the time. When I got over the line against him I couldn\u2019t believe it. But the reason I won is that I finished it so coolly. I was proud of that. It was even more intense afterwards. I was in such disbelief but the spectators were a lot more behind me and they were jumping about. You could feel the electricity in the air. It was brilliant.</p> <p>\u201cI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/27/fallon-sherrock-pdc-world-darts-run-ended-chris-dobey\" title=\"\">lost to Chris Dobey</a> in the third round but I enjoyed every moment. I put in a great performance and he had to pull out everything to beat me.

I think it was different a while ago but attitudes have definitely changed. The men I\u2019ve played are all respectful and gentlemen towards me. I\u2019ve never really had a problem. In the past a lot of people would go: \u2018We\u2019re playing a woman.\u2019 But now they\u2019re thinking: \u2018We\u2019re playing a good player.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sherrock admits it is more challenging for her to play against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/lisa-ashton-dont-want-special-treatment-women-darts-pdc-mens-tour\" title=\"\">other leading women in Suzuki and Lisa Ashton</a>. \u201cAgainst the men I have a point to prove. So I have more determination whereas, when I\u2019m playing the women, we know each other\u2019s games so well. I need that extra boost just to prove to the men we can compete against them.\u201d</p> <p>Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/31/fallon-sherrock-withdraws-bdo-world-darts-prize-money\" title=\"\">Sherrock withdrew from the BDO women\u2019s world championship</a> because the prize money had been slashed. \u201cI got the email saying it was going to be cut from \u00a320,000 to \u00a38,000 and that\u2019s a massive drop. The prize money is the main thing for me \u2013 because I\u2019ve got to support my little boy. I could not justify playing in the competition because I also didn\u2019t know if I was going to get paid at all.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/18/q-school-pdc-darts-delusions-chaos-chance-new-life-fallon-sherrock\">Delusions, chaos and a shot at a new life at Q-School, darts\u2019 dream factory | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Suzuki won the tournament, beating Ashton in the final, but Sherrock says: \u201cThey still haven\u2019t been paid and it\u2019s a month later. So I don\u2019t regret that decision at all.\u201d</p> <p>She played in a celebrity tournament in Germany instead, alongside Phil Taylor and Michael van Gerwen, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/darts/50998035\" title=\"\">partnered Luca Toni</a>, the former Italian footballer and 2006 World Cup winner. As the single parent of an autistic son, Rory, Sherrock has financial responsibilities while juggling her onerous schedules as a mum and a new star in darts.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s quite happy at the moment,\u201d she says of her son. \u201cEvery time I\u2019m really busy, he\u2019s like: \u2018So what are you buying me next?\u2019 I keep buying him a toy every time, and he loves it.\u201d</p> <p>Being a parent of an autistic child is not easy, as Sherrock acknowledges. \u201cIt has been very difficult. But I\u2019ve got a good family support and I\u2019ve worked out a routine that works for him now. When all this kicked off at the worlds it just exploded. So we\u2019ve had to adjust. I\u2019m now at home in the week, looking after my little boy and doing all my work while he\u2019s at school. He goes away to his nan\u2019s on weekends when I\u2019m playing. So it\u2019s like he has my rules and then no rules at his nanny\u2019s. So whenever I am away he feels like he\u2019s on vacation. But any changes I need, my mum helps out a lot. So it\u2019s working out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5729b9597f1c261855038709114e72e3f9c32c16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5729b9597f1c261855038709114e72e3f9c32c16/0_326_4441_5812/764.jpg\" alt=\"Fallon Sherrock will become the first woman to play Premier League darts on Thursday\" width=\"764\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fallon Sherrock will become the first woman to play Premier League darts on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sherrock has been even more impressive since the world championship in the way she has coped with her sudden fame and increased commitments. This month, among 200 other players, she <a href=\"https://www.skysports.com/darts/news/12288/11925070/fallon-sherrock-qualifies-for-2020-uk-open\" title=\"\">qualified for the UK Open</a>, which will give her another chance to play against the world\u2019s best men in March. \u201cI was absolutely delighted because after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/18/q-school-pdc-darts-delusions-chaos-chance-new-life-fallon-sherrock\" title=\"\">Q</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/18/q-school-pdc-darts-delusions-chaos-chance-new-life-fallon-sherrock\" title=\"\">-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/18/q-school-pdc-darts-delusions-chaos-chance-new-life-fallon-sherrock\" title=\"\">School</a>, where I didn\u2019t get my [PDC] tour card, qualifying for the UK Open was my next goal.\u201d</p> <p>Her success at the world championship also meant Sherrock has been invited to compete in the Premier League as one of nine challengers against the top nine men in professional darts. Her debut in the competition marks another milestone for Sherrock and all female darts players. \u201cAny game I play on TV is a big deal for me,\u201d she stresses, \u201cbecause I just want to show people what I can do. And playing in the Premier League makes me so excited. Same goes for being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/29/fallon-sherrock-world-series-darts\" title=\"\">invited to play in the World Series</a> in New York and other places. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p> <p>I like the way Sherrock tells me that, when she was a girl, she dreamed of becoming a forensic scientist. But, now, she is simply intent on making more sporting history. Can she beat Glen Durrant on Thursday \u2013 her first Premier League opponent? \u201cI\u2019ve never played Glen but when I was on the BDO circuit he was a three-time BDO world champion. So I know how well he plays. He\u2019ll just play the board and won\u2019t worry about the crowd or playing me.\u201d</p> <p>Sherrock\u2019s eyes glitter as she anticipates another big night in her transformed career. All the trolls and haters who haunted and then motivated her retreat further into the shadows as she says: \u201cI don\u2019t ever believe I\u2019m going to lose when I go out there. If you don\u2019t believe in yourself, there\u2019s no point playing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cEvery little bit of hate just gees me on to do better and prove them all wrong,\u201d Fallon Sherrock says with quiet calm as she explains how the abuse she has suffered online helped her to make history as the first woman to win a match at the PDC world darts championship in December. \u201cIt made me a stronger person, and more determined. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d still be as strong if I didn\u2019t have all that hate. I needed hate to make me more determined.\u201d It seems the best and most coherent way of dealing with the epidemic of hate, especially towards women, that infects social media. Sherrock not only won two matches in the world championship but on Thursday in Nottingham she will become the first woman to play Premier League darts. She has also been exalted on social media, with plaudits for her sporting breakthrough ranging from tweets by Billie Jean King to Instagram posts by Sarah Jessica Parker who wrote of Sherrock: \u201cMaking history and our hearts stop as we watched in astonishment and awe.\u201d But, after 45 minutes in Sherrock\u2019s company, it is plain that bleak misogyny has fired her determination. It stretches back to the time, more than five years ago, when Sherrock fell ill soon after giving birth to her son. A mysterious kidney ailment caused her face to become bloated. She kept playing darts despite the wounding comments made about her appearance \u2013 just as she keeps on when she is vilified for daring to play professional darts against men. Sherrock raises a wry eyebrow over her glasses, and taps her long painted fingernails patiently on the table, when I ask if online hate continues alongside the delight accompanying her world championship success. \u201cYeah. You\u2019re always going to get hate. Obviously no one says anything to me, but it\u2019s different online. People just hide behind the computer at home.\u201d But she uses that hate? \u201cDefinitely. If I\u2019m feeling a bit slouchy, I\u2019ll look at some of the comments and I\u2019ll be like: \u2018OK, now I need to prove you wrong.\u2019\u201d Sherrock also points out that she has not had to do this since the world championship. \u201cI\u2019ve not been slouchy this year at all. A few years back I got complacent. That\u2019s when I needed to fire myself up. Now if I see any of the bad comments I go past them. Or my management team takes it away so I don\u2019t have to look at it. In the past I used to take it to heart. It made me stronger and more determined to prove everyone wrong. But if I hadn\u2019t been strong\u2011minded I could have buckled from all the nasty comments.\u201d Does she ever confront the trolls online? \u201cI\u2019ve not been tempted to call anyone out because most of them making comments don\u2019t play darts. So they don\u2019t understand anything. And those just trying to be nasty need to be ignored. If I react it\u2019s giving them fuel and I\u2019m not that type of person. If I start commenting back, I\u2019d be as bad as them. Anyway, if you just wondered what everyone thought all the time you wouldn\u2019t achieve anything.\u201d Sherrock achieved a memorable and historic feat when she beat Ted Evetts in the opening round of the world championship. She was one of two women who had battled through the qualifiers to reach the main draw. Mikuru Suzuki played James Richardson a few days before Sherrock\u2019s debut. Suzuki came close to becoming the first woman to win a match at the world championship but she lost 3-2. \u201cI watched it at home and I was egging Mikuru on to win,\u201d Sherrock says. \u201cShe missed out by a few darts. But that definitely inspired me. I\u2019d never had the opportunity to prove myself before but I knew I had the game to beat Ted.\u201d As the match unfolded was she conscious of the crowd\u2019s support for her? \u201cDefinitely. It made me feel so comfortable and confident. I know it sounds ridiculous, because there were so many people, but I felt so calm up there. I didn\u2019t feel nervous at all. But once I\u2019d won I was overwhelmed and didn\u2019t know if I wanted to cry or jump around. I was so happy and excited.\u201d Sherrock\u2019s victory unleashed so many tributes that, once again, she felt swamped by an intense mix of emotions. \u201cWhen Billie Jean King started tweeting messages to me I was like: \u2018Wow, this amazing person\u2019s actually contacted me.\u2019 I\u2019m just a normal girl from Milton Keynes. This stuff doesn\u2019t happen to people like me. And then it was the Instagram post from Sarah Jessica Parker. I watched Sex and the City so that was amazing as well. To have two massive people contact me was incredible. I was like: \u2018Fallon, don\u2019t get too carried away. Just put it to one side and you can come back and stare at it later.\u2019 I focused on what I had to do.\u201d In the second round she beat Mensur Suljovic. Sherrock\u2019s face lights up at the memory. \u201cIt was such a privilege to play Mensur. He was the 11th best player in the world and I see him on TV all the time. When I got over the line against him I couldn\u2019t believe it. But the reason I won is that I finished it so coolly. I was proud of that. It was even more intense afterwards. I was in such disbelief but the spectators were a lot more behind me and they were jumping about. You could feel the electricity in the air. It was brilliant. \u201cI lost to Chris Dobey in the third round but I enjoyed every moment. I put in a great performance and he had to pull out everything to beat me. I\u2019m really proud I made him bring out his best game.\u201d How have the men on the PDC circuit reacted to her? \u201cWe\u2019re all friends,\u201d Sherrock says. \u201cBut when we get to the oche we switch off and play hard. I think it was different a while ago but attitudes have definitely changed. The men I\u2019ve played are all respectful and gentlemen towards me. I\u2019ve never really had a problem. In the past a lot of people would go: \u2018We\u2019re playing a woman.\u2019 But now they\u2019re thinking: \u2018We\u2019re playing a good player.\u2019\u201d Sherrock admits it is more challenging for her to play against other leading women in Suzuki and Lisa Ashton. \u201cAgainst the men I have a point to prove. So I have more determination whereas, when I\u2019m playing the women, we know each other\u2019s games so well. I need that extra boost just to prove to the men we can compete against them.\u201d Last month Sherrock withdrew from the BDO women\u2019s world championship because the prize money had been slashed. \u201cI got the email saying it was going to be cut from \u00a320,000 to \u00a38,000 and that\u2019s a massive drop. The prize money is the main thing for me \u2013 because I\u2019ve got to support my little boy. I could not justify playing in the competition because I also didn\u2019t know if I was going to get paid at all.\u201d Suzuki won the tournament, beating Ashton in the final, but Sherrock says: \u201cThey still haven\u2019t been paid and it\u2019s a month later. So I don\u2019t regret that decision at all.\u201d She played in a celebrity tournament in Germany instead, alongside Phil Taylor and Michael van Gerwen, and partnered Luca Toni, the former Italian footballer and 2006 World Cup winner. As the single parent of an autistic son, Rory, Sherrock has financial responsibilities while juggling her onerous schedules as a mum and a new star in darts. \u201cHe\u2019s quite happy at the moment,\u201d she says of her son. \u201cEvery time I\u2019m really busy, he\u2019s like: \u2018So what are you buying me next?\u2019 I keep buying him a toy every time, and he loves it.\u201d Being a parent of an autistic child is not easy, as Sherrock acknowledges. \u201cIt has been very difficult. But I\u2019ve got a good family support and I\u2019ve worked out a routine that works for him now. When all this kicked off at the worlds it just exploded. So we\u2019ve had to adjust. I\u2019m now at home in the week, looking after my little boy and doing all my work while he\u2019s at school. He goes away to his nan\u2019s on weekends when I\u2019m playing. So it\u2019s like he has my rules and then no rules at his nanny\u2019s. So whenever I am away he feels like he\u2019s on vacation. But any changes I need, my mum helps out a lot. So it\u2019s working out.\u201d Sherrock has been even more impressive since the world championship in the way she has coped with her sudden fame and increased commitments. This month, among 200 other players, she qualified for the UK Open, which will give her another chance to play against the world\u2019s best men in March. \u201cI was absolutely delighted because after Q-School, where I didn\u2019t get my [PDC] tour card, qualifying for the UK Open was my next goal.\u201d Her success at the world championship also meant Sherrock has been invited to compete in the Premier League as one of nine challengers against the top nine men in professional darts. Her debut in the competition marks another milestone for Sherrock and all female darts players. \u201cAny game I play on TV is a big deal for me,\u201d she stresses, \u201cbecause I just want to show people what I can do. And playing in the Premier League makes me so excited. Same goes for being invited to play in the World Series in New York and other places. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d I like the way Sherrock tells me that, when she was a girl, she dreamed of becoming a forensic scientist. But, now, she is simply intent on making more sporting history. Can she beat Glen Durrant on Thursday \u2013 her first Premier League opponent? \u201cI\u2019ve never played Glen but when I was on the BDO circuit he was a three-time BDO world champion. So I know how well he plays. He\u2019ll just play the board and won\u2019t worry about the crowd or playing me.\u201d Sherrock\u2019s eyes glitter as she anticipates another big night in her transformed career. All the trolls and haters who haunted and then motivated her retreat further into the shadows as she says: \u201cI don\u2019t ever believe I\u2019m going to lose when I go out there. If you don\u2019t believe in yourself, there\u2019s no point playing.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Now that Britain has left the European Union, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has moved swiftly to put French nuclear weapons front and centre of EU defence policies. In an hour-long speech on Friday to L\u2019\u00c9cole de guerre (School of War) in Paris, the French president called for a European dialogue about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/\" title=\"\">defence and deterrence</a> based on France\u2019s <em>force de frappe</em> of nuclear weapons launched by air and submarine, and invited other EU states to participate in exercises by his country\u2019s nuclear forces.</p> <p>This is the post-Brexit revival of a vision held by successive French leaders, who itched to establish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/nine-eu-states-to-sign-off-on-joint-military-intervention-force\" title=\"\">EU defence policies</a> that would rely on European nuclear weapons rather than the US and Nato. For decades, this aim was marginalised by other EU members. Brexit, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have emboldened Macron to put it back on the table \u2013 and this time he is getting more attention.</p> <p>French ambitions to provide the nuclear deterrence role in an integrated EU defence policy had previously been thwarted by Germany and the UK, which were more closely embedded with Nato and considered the US to be more reliable. Those governments have always been wary of France\u2019s nuclear plans, although David Cameron eagerly entered into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/07/options-trident-kicked-o\" title=\"\">2010 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/07/options-trident-kicked-o\" title=\"\">Teutates </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/07/options-trident-kicked-o\" title=\"\">treaty</a> with France that enabled both nuclear-armed nations to share research facilities and cooperate on technology. The main purpose of Teutates, however, was to help both countries share the financial burdens of maintaining their nuclear status.</p> <p>Everything has now changed: with Brexit, the UK no longer has a voice in the EU, while Germany has become increasingly anxious about the nuclear policies of President Trump. Last week, a senior member of Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party in the Bundestag, Johann Wadephul, publicly raised the \u201cquestion of French nuclear weapons as an element of European deterrence\u201d. The remarks appear to have been coordinated with France in advance of Macron\u2019s speech. By characterising the role of French nuclear forces in terms of European security, stability and \u201cproper deterrence\u201d, Macron attempts to provide reassurance. Recognising the fears engendered by a reinvigorated nuclear arms race between the US and Russia in their efforts to build more, \u201cusable\u201d nuclear weapons, including a new generation of enhanced medium-range missiles, Macron promised that \u201cFrance will never engage in nuclear battle\u201d.</p> <p>Previous attempts to portray France\u2019s military forces as \u201cEuropean deterrents\u201d had come up against a locked door, bolted on the inside by the UK and Germany. Now, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/05/nato-is-not-braindead-but-it-does-need-a-shot-of-adrenaline\" title=\"\">Nato in disarray</a>, the UK marginalised, and Putin and Trump busy competing with each other on various fronts, Macron clearly hopes that other European countries are ready to welcome French nuclear weapons as guarantors of regional security.</p> <p>Macron also hopes to legitimise France\u2019s nuclear weapons and policies in advance of the important review conference of the 1968 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/05/nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty\" title=\"\">non-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/05/nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty\" title=\"\">proliferation </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/05/nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty\" title=\"\">treaty</a> (NPT) in April. He and the other nuclear-armed governments know they will face strong criticism for undermining the NPT and failing to comply with its fundamental nuclear disarmament obligations.

      "bodyText": "Now that Britain has left the European Union, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has moved swiftly to put French nuclear weapons front and centre of EU defence policies. In an hour-long speech on Friday to L\u2019\u00c9cole de guerre (School of War) in Paris, the French president called for a European dialogue about defence and deterrence based on France\u2019s force de frappe of nuclear weapons launched by air and submarine, and invited other EU states to participate in exercises by his country\u2019s nuclear forces. This is the post-Brexit revival of a vision held by successive French leaders, who itched to establish EU defence policies that would rely on European nuclear weapons rather than the US and Nato. For decades, this aim was marginalised by other EU members. Brexit, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have emboldened Macron to put it back on the table \u2013 and this time he is getting more attention. French ambitions to provide the nuclear deterrence role in an integrated EU defence policy had previously been thwarted by Germany and the UK, which were more closely embedded with Nato and considered the US to be more reliable. Those governments have always been wary of France\u2019s nuclear plans, although David Cameron eagerly entered into the 2010 Teutates treaty with France that enabled both nuclear-armed nations to share research facilities and cooperate on technology. The main purpose of Teutates, however, was to help both countries share the financial burdens of maintaining their nuclear status. Everything has now changed: with Brexit, the UK no longer has a voice in the EU, while Germany has become increasingly anxious about the nuclear policies of President Trump. Last week, a senior member of Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party in the Bundestag, Johann Wadephul, publicly raised the \u201cquestion of French nuclear weapons as an element of European deterrence\u201d. The remarks appear to have been coordinated with France in advance of Macron\u2019s speech. By characterising the role of French nuclear forces in terms of European security, stability and \u201cproper deterrence\u201d, Macron attempts to provide reassurance. Recognising the fears engendered by a reinvigorated nuclear arms race between the US and Russia in their efforts to build more, \u201cusable\u201d nuclear weapons, including a new generation of enhanced medium-range missiles, Macron promised that \u201cFrance will never engage in nuclear battle\u201d. Previous attempts to portray France\u2019s military forces as \u201cEuropean deterrents\u201d had come up against a locked door, bolted on the inside by the UK and Germany. Now, with Nato in disarray, the UK marginalised, and Putin and Trump busy competing with each other on various fronts, Macron clearly hopes that other European countries are ready to welcome French nuclear weapons as guarantors of regional security. Macron also hopes to legitimise France\u2019s nuclear weapons and policies in advance of the important review conference of the 1968 non-proliferation treaty (NPT) in April. He and the other nuclear-armed governments know they will face strong criticism for undermining the NPT and failing to comply with its fundamental nuclear disarmament obligations. The newest tool in the non-proliferation regime is the 2017 treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, which was negotiated in the UN general assembly after the 2015 NPT conference failed. This landmark treaty prohibits all activities associated with acquiring, possessing, deploying and using nuclear weapons. It was adopted in 2017 by 122 parties to the NPT, of which 80 have signed in the first two years, including EU members Ireland and Austria. Even before the treaty enters into full legal force, in France and other non-signatory countries, its objectives and provisions are leading to steps taken by municipal authorities and financial institutions to divest from nuclear weapons and promote nuclear disarmament. Macron\u2019s references to this treaty in his speech are dismissive, but they also demonstrate his anxiety about its impact on France\u2019s nuclear establishment \u2013 France previously opposed the NPT before signing up to it in 1992. Beset by yellow vests and economic woes, Macron desperately needs a big idea to distract from his domestic challenges, and hopes that the vision of uniting Europe under a French nuclear umbrella will work. It won\u2019t. Macron is right to warn that nuclear risks are increasing, but his answer of France supplying Europe with nuclear deterrence flies in the face of reality. Theorising about deterrence, the French president tries to avoid the inescapable fact that relying on nuclear weapons for deterrence requires preparedness, policies and doctrines to actually use them.

Intu is struggling with \u00a34.7bn of debt at a time when its retail tenants are closing stores in response to rising costs and as consumers shift to online spending. Its property portfolio is officially valued at \u00a38bn but is now worth a lot less. Shares rose 30% to 17p after the announcement, giving it a market value of about \u00a3234m. Peel Group, which holds a 27% stake in the business, is run by the 77-year-old billionaire John Whittaker, who was behind the Trafford Centre development and sold it to Intu in 2011. The group first said in January that it would attempt an equity raise to fix its balance sheet, although it did not specify a figure. Property analysts have estimated the company will need to raise between \u00a31bn and \u00a33bn to shore up its finances. The company\u2019s share price has plunged by 85% in the last year as some of its largest tenants such as Debenhams, House of Fraser and the Topshop owner, Arcadia, have undergone emergency restructurings, which have led to the closure of some stores and requests for rent reductions at others. Intu operates 14 shopping centres across the UK, in cities from Nottingham to Norwich. It has been selling assets in an attempt to bring down its debt and since the beginning of the year it has sold two of its three Spanish shopping centres: Intu Asturias in Oviedo, which produced net proceeds of \u20ac85m (\u00a372m), and Intu Puerto Venecia in Zaragoza, which brought in \u20ac115m. The company has been investing money to add leisure facilities to some of its shopping centres, so it can offer visitors more than just shopping. However, as retail sales increasingly move online, the value of Intu\u2019s malls is expected to fall further.",

The Museum of London on Monday revealed new finds among the Havering hoard, a remarkable collection of 453 swords, axes, knives, chisels, sickles, razors, ingots and bracelets excavated from a quarry in east London over a period of three months and revealed last year. Dating from 900-800BC, it is the third largest bronze age hoard ever discovered in the UK. Closer examination has revealed what are believed to be a pair of terret rings, used to prevent the reins tangling on horse-drawn carts. Bronze age examples have been found before in France but not the UK. There is also a bracelet believed to be from what is now north-west France, and copper ingots possibly originating from the Alps. Kate Sumnall, a curator of archaeology at the museum, said the unexpected finds suggested links to Europe that were nearly 3,000 years old. \u201cThese objects give clues about how this wasn\u2019t an isolated community but rather one that fitted into a much larger cultural group with connections along the Thames Valley and across the continent.\u201d What the discoveries do not do is help solve the mystery of the hoard\u2019s origins. Sumnall is curating an exhibition on the hoard to be staged at the museum\u2019s Docklands outpost in April, and she admits there are still more questions than answers. \u201cWe pulled together a room full of bronze age specialists to discuss some of this, to discuss our interpretation and hopefully to narrow things down \u2026 and you can\u2019t get the room to agree,\u201d she said. There are four theories about why so many objects would have been deliberately broken and meticulously buried. Was it a ritualistic offering to the gods? Was it to do with it being the late bronze age and start of the iron age, so the objects were no longer so highly valued or wanted? Could a powerful person have been trying to control the amount of bronze that was in circulation and being traded? Or was the location a kind of bronze age storage site? The total weight of the objects is 45kg, so they could not have been easily carried around. All of the theories raise their own questions. If they were being stored, for example, why were they not retrieved? Sumnall said the exhibition would not be prescriptive. \u201cWe will be saying: here are the clues, form your own conclusion.\u201d Havering Hoard: A Bronze Age Mystery is at the Museum of London Docklands from 3 April-1 November.",

In fact, we cannot afford to accept it.\u201d</p> <p>The move by staff follows a weekend of protest at the museum, which began on Friday night when protesters dressed as ancient Greek warriors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/07/climate-activists-bring-trojan-horse-to-british-museum\">smuggled a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/07/climate-activists-bring-trojan-horse-to-british-museum\">four-metre Trojan horse </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/07/climate-activists-bring-trojan-horse-to-british-museum\">on to the museum\u2019s forecourt</a>. The protest was in response to the exhibition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/24/troy-myth-and-reality-review-british-museum-london\">Troy: Myth and Reality</a>, which is described as \u201csupported by BP\u201d.</p> <p>On Saturday, 1,500 supporters took part in a day of protests, occupying 11 of the museum\u2019s rooms, with speeches, singalongs, and talks by campaigners from West Papua and Senegal.</p> <p>Origami swans <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drop_BP/status/1226158241933152256/photo/1\">were scattered</a> throughout the museum adorned with messages including: \u201cChoose sponsors who care about our future.\u201d Protesters finished the day by tearing apart paper versions of BP\u2019s logo near the museum\u2019s main entrance.</p> <p>The protest is the latest escalation in the campaign to end fossil fuel sponsorship at the UK\u2019s leading cultural venues. In October, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/oct/02/royal-shakespeare-company-to-end-bp-sponsorship-deal\">Royal Shakespeare Company ditched its sponsorship deal with BP</a>, after a campaign from artists, environmentalists and members of the public.</p> <p>Monday\u2019s backing from museum staff will increase the pressure on management to take action. The statement was co-signed by former museum trustee Ahdaf Soueif, who resigned last summer over the BP sponsorship, the treatment of workers and the issue of repatriation of artefacts.</p> <p>Soueif said: \u201cCultural institutions have a moral responsibility in who they choose as partners. It\u2019s time for the British Museum to respond to the legitimate and pressing concerns of young people across the planet.

      "bodyText": "Staff working at the British Museum in London have joined calls for its management to ditch its sponsorship deal with the oil company BP after a weekend of protests. Members of the PCS union\u2019s culture group, which represents 4,000 workers across the UK\u2019s leading cultural sites, said the museum had a duty to recognise the escalating climate crisis and cut its ties with BP \u2013 one of the world\u2019s biggest producers of fossil fuels. \u201cAs a public institution, the British Museum owes it to its staff, its visitors and its future to play a responsible role in the greatest challenge facing society,\u201d the PCS union said in a statement on Monday. \u201cIt is not true that we cannot afford to refuse BP\u2019s oil money. In fact, we cannot afford to accept it.\u201d The move by staff follows a weekend of protest at the museum, which began on Friday night when protesters dressed as ancient Greek warriors smuggled a four-metre Trojan horse on to the museum\u2019s forecourt. The protest was in response to the exhibition Troy: Myth and Reality, which is described as \u201csupported by BP\u201d. On Saturday, 1,500 supporters took part in a day of protests, occupying 11 of the museum\u2019s rooms, with speeches, singalongs, and talks by campaigners from West Papua and Senegal. Origami swans were scattered throughout the museum adorned with messages including: \u201cChoose sponsors who care about our future.\u201d Protesters finished the day by tearing apart paper versions of BP\u2019s logo near the museum\u2019s main entrance. The protest is the latest escalation in the campaign to end fossil fuel sponsorship at the UK\u2019s leading cultural venues. In October, the Royal Shakespeare Company ditched its sponsorship deal with BP, after a campaign from artists, environmentalists and members of the public. Monday\u2019s backing from museum staff will increase the pressure on management to take action. The statement was co-signed by former museum trustee Ahdaf Soueif, who resigned last summer over the BP sponsorship, the treatment of workers and the issue of repatriation of artefacts. Soueif said: \u201cCultural institutions have a moral responsibility in who they choose as partners. It\u2019s time for the British Museum to respond to the legitimate and pressing concerns of young people across the planet. It\u2019s time to drop BP.\u201d A spokesperson for the British Museum said: \u201cWe are aware of the comments from the PCS union and will continue to liaise with the British Museum PCS branch and our staff more generally.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/feb/03/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos </a>from the last week.</p> <p>It\u2019s only February, but <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/748720\">JayZed </a>thinks Hurricane Season by Fernanda Melchor (translated by Sophie Hughes) could be the book of the year:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wow, this novel left me reeling. It\u2019s about a murder in the rural slums of Veracruz in Mexico, and the harsh and violent lives of the people involved. The subject matter is brutal throughout: as well as the murder there\u2019s domestic violence, drug addiction, prostitution, child sexual abuse, police brutality, backstreet abortions and much more. Yes, it\u2019s all very harrowing and as a reader you feel more than a few punches to the gut, but the book is sustained and elevated by the stunning prose: it\u2019s relentless and unflinching, but also mesmerising and at times darkly, beautifully luminous\u2026 The year is young, but this is probably book of the year for me so far. A brilliant job by both writer and translator.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13035061\">BobHammond2</a> has just finished The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay by Michael Chabon:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I won\u2019t go on about it too much as it\u2019s been widely reviewed and praised by others over the years, apart from to say I massively enjoyed it. There was a lot more to it than I was expecting, as it flitted from Prague to the US to the South Pole, and covered such topics as the treatment of the Jews during WW2, the explosion of the comic book industry during and after the war, magic and escapology. All delivered with a wry humour by Michael Chabon that had me constantly smiling in the two weeks it took me to read it.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI am truly amazed\u201d by The Vet\u2019s Daughter by Barbara Comyns, says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13505124\">lonelybloomer</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is about what I think should be called profound evil. There\u2019s so much death and pain in it, and weirdness, and creepy fun. Yet it doesn\u2019t bring one down. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Autumn of the Patriarch by Gabriel Garcia M\u00e1rquez is \u201can incredible novel,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13472965\">SydneyH</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The text is a sort of nightmarish satire of the dictator-state, set in a Caribbean nation. The term \u2018magic realism\u2019 may be appropriate for One Hundred Years of Solitude, where gypsies get up to mischief in an historical locale, but I don\u2019t think it is suitable here. Firstly, because the country isn\u2019t specified, and so the narrative takes place in a hazy fictional realm. Secondly, with the exception of an incident of fortune-telling, there is little sorcery in any recognisable form, though the lepers in the colony are convinced that the chief\u2019s touch will cure their ailment. The dream-like episodes progress from the tyrant\u2019s virile youth to senility, when his appointed deputies torture and kill quite independently. Through it all is an element of farce that seems inherent to this form of leadership, such as when the autocrat games the lottery to ensure that he is the winner on every occasion. Probably the most defining quality of the work is the immersive prose, written without paragraph breaks. I suspect this would be frustrating for many people, but this translation of Gregory Rabassa is irresistible.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Tiger\u2019s Wife by T\u00e9a Obreht has proved irresistible to <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10247310\">Sara Richards</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As part of my project of reading through all the winners of the Women\u2019s Prize I got to The Tiger\u2019s Wife by T\u00e9a Obreht which was a haunting story of a village somewhere in the Balkans between the two world wars and the more recent conflicts.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from the last week. It\u2019s only February, but JayZed thinks Hurricane Season by Fernanda Melchor (translated by Sophie Hughes) could be the book of the year: Wow, this novel left me reeling. It\u2019s about a murder in the rural slums of Veracruz in Mexico, and the harsh and violent lives of the people involved. The subject matter is brutal throughout: as well as the murder there\u2019s domestic violence, drug addiction, prostitution, child sexual abuse, police brutality, backstreet abortions and much more. Yes, it\u2019s all very harrowing and as a reader you feel more than a few punches to the gut, but the book is sustained and elevated by the stunning prose: it\u2019s relentless and unflinching, but also mesmerising and at times darkly, beautifully luminous\u2026 The year is young, but this is probably book of the year for me so far. A brilliant job by both writer and translator. BobHammond2 has just finished The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay by Michael Chabon: I won\u2019t go on about it too much as it\u2019s been widely reviewed and praised by others over the years, apart from to say I massively enjoyed it. There was a lot more to it than I was expecting, as it flitted from Prague to the US to the South Pole, and covered such topics as the treatment of the Jews during WW2, the explosion of the comic book industry during and after the war, magic and escapology. All delivered with a wry humour by Michael Chabon that had me constantly smiling in the two weeks it took me to read it. \u201cI am truly amazed\u201d by The Vet\u2019s Daughter by Barbara Comyns, says lonelybloomer: It is about what I think should be called profound evil. There\u2019s so much death and pain in it, and weirdness, and creepy fun. Yet it doesn\u2019t bring one down. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. The Autumn of the Patriarch by Gabriel Garcia M\u00e1rquez is \u201can incredible novel,\u201d says SydneyH: The text is a sort of nightmarish satire of the dictator-state, set in a Caribbean nation. The term \u2018magic realism\u2019 may be appropriate for One Hundred Years of Solitude, where gypsies get up to mischief in an historical locale, but I don\u2019t think it is suitable here. Firstly, because the country isn\u2019t specified, and so the narrative takes place in a hazy fictional realm. Secondly, with the exception of an incident of fortune-telling, there is little sorcery in any recognisable form, though the lepers in the colony are convinced that the chief\u2019s touch will cure their ailment. The dream-like episodes progress from the tyrant\u2019s virile youth to senility, when his appointed deputies torture and kill quite independently. Through it all is an element of farce that seems inherent to this form of leadership, such as when the autocrat games the lottery to ensure that he is the winner on every occasion. Probably the most defining quality of the work is the immersive prose, written without paragraph breaks. I suspect this would be frustrating for many people, but this translation of Gregory Rabassa is irresistible. The Tiger\u2019s Wife by T\u00e9a Obreht has proved irresistible to Sara Richards: As part of my project of reading through all the winners of the Women\u2019s Prize I got to The Tiger\u2019s Wife by T\u00e9a Obreht which was a haunting story of a village somewhere in the Balkans between the two world wars and the more recent conflicts. Obreht uses a mix of history and folklore which I find irresistible in any novel set among the villages in the area my grandparents came from, and in that rich mix some eternal truths are spelled out\u2026 This novel isn\u2019t very long but is so different from the other prize winners and it is dense and moving and beautifully written. \u201cJulian Barnes\u2019s The Man in the Red Coat is an absolute delight,\u201d says proust: I was given it in hardback for Christmas, and it is best appreciated in this format, given its exquisite illustrations. Brilliantly well written and researched, with laugh out loud sentences on every page. Fascinating insight into the fin-de-si\u00e8cle and belle \u00e9poque. This is a book to treasure. Dracula by Bram Stoker has sunk its teeth into dylan37: Undeniably classic. Powerful and emotional, covering a great deal of ground in economic and pacy storytelling: Victorian manners, social propriety, fairytale, folklore, and the early days of psychoanalysis. Genuinely eye-widening in the action sequences, and occasionally drily amusing. (On the journey to the Count\u2019s castle, Harker overhears some remarks about him in an inn, and translates them as \u201cdevil\u201d and \u201cvampire\u201d. He makes a memo to self: must ask the Count about these local superstitions). And there\u2019s a very dirty joke smuggled in to the final lines of chapter 8. Bringing his diabolical endeavour ashore at Whitby, through a bustling dirty London, and back to misty mountains of Transylvania, this bloody midnight visitor keeps us on the run \u2013 breathless, watchful, and trying to get all business concluded before sunrise. Finally, Fear Is the Rider by Kenneth Cook has unsettled jimitron5000: This is hold-your-breath, shut your eyes and hope it\u2019s over, edge of the seat stuff. A man driving across the outback to go his new job meets a young woman on the way. Thinking with his wrong brain he follows the track she is taking, something entirely unsuitable in his little Honda. As he drives along she runs out in front of him, terrified, having narrowly escaped from a madman. He picks her up and from then on it is chase in the desert. The two of them trying to get away in a small Honda, the axe-wielding assailant following them in a land cruiser. Sure, some of the dialogue might be a bit wooden, and there might not be a great deal of character development but what it lacks in polish it makes up for in just how unsettling it is. Never think with your wrong brain! Interesting links about books and reading A pioneering novel that took 87 years to find a publisher.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s water regulator is to face scrutiny from the competition watchdog after setting the water industry\u2019s strictest price controls. Yorkshire Water has become the first large water company to challenge Ofwat\u2019s industry price review, which sets out how much water companies can invest and charge customers over the next five years. In December the regulator ordered water companies in England and Wales to cut bills for customers by \u00a350 over five years, while spending \u00a351bn on improving services and investment in infrastructure. Ofwat also told the companies to cut the amount of water lost to leaks by 16%, which it said would save enough water to meet the needs of everyone in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield. The regulator\u2019s crackdown on the sector followed an outcry over the industry\u2019s lucrative shareholder payouts, questionable tax arrangements and poor record on preventing pollution and tackling leaks. Yorkshire Water\u2019s appeal means Ofwat\u2019s decision will be referred to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which will decide whether the price controls are fair. Thames Water and Northumbrian Water are also understood to be considering whether to challenge Ofwat\u2019s price review before the deadline for appeals on 15 February, which would put the regulator on a collision course with the industry. About half of the UK\u2019s major water companies have publicly accepted Ofwat\u2019s decision on their business plans and are not expected to launch an appeal. These include the listed water giants United Utilities and Severn Trent, as well as Severn Trent\u2019s subsidiary supplier, Hafren Dyfrdwy, and Wessex Water. The companies are not under any obligation to say whether they agree with the regulator\u2019s decisions but they must say whether they plan to appeal before the end of this week. Welsh Water has also accepted the regulator\u2019s tougher price control and was told by ratings agency Moody\u2019s that its credit score would be downgraded as a result. Ofwat\u2019s latest round of financial controls are considered the toughest presented to the water industry because it calls on the companies to make major investments while keeping bills low. Yorkshire Water said it would not accept Ofwat\u2019s decision because it would force the company to sacrifice critical long-term investments in favour of meeting short-term targets. Liz Barber, Yorkshire Water\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe\u2019re naturally committed to being the most efficient company we can but have decided that accepting this determination would jeopardise Yorkshire\u2019s resilience and our own. \u201cEveryone at Yorkshire Water shares a common purpose to provide safe and reliable services to our customers and our county long into the future.\u201d An Ofwat spokeswoman said the regulator had challenged all water companies by putting forward the greenest price review to help ensure there are improvements to customer services and lower bills. \u201cWe are ready to fully engage with the CMA process, setting out our analysis and why we are confident this is the right settlement for customers, the environment and the company,\u201d she said. Water UK said last week that the average UK water bill would fall by \u00a317 a year in the next financial year, down from an average of \u00a3413.33 to \u00a3396.60.

      "body": "<p>Georges Duboeuf, who has died aged 86, was one of the giants of the international wine industry. Born into a family with four centuries\u2019 history of winemaking in Pouilly Fuiss\u00e9 in the south of Burgundy, Duboeuf launched his own brand, Les Vins Georges Duboeuf, in 1964.</p> <p>From the outset he had bigger ambitions than his neighbours, most of whom were happy to sell their wine fairly cheaply in nearby Lyon and Paris. Duboeuf not only wanted it to be listed in Michelin-starred restaurants across France, but also overseas.</p> <p>The key to achieving this lay in the tradition of releasing the latest vintage of beaujolais as nouveau \u2013 new \u2013 wine on the third Thursday in November each year, just a few weeks after the harvest. There are various versions of the history of the beaujolais nouveau race. According to one, it began as a competition to get the wine to the French capital, inspired by Duboeuf seeing a roughly painted sign on the window of a Paris bistro announcing that \u201c<em>le beaujolais nouveau est arriv\u00e9</em>\u201d.</p> <p>There is no question that the race to rush the wine to London began in 1970 as a private challenge between <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a08d6da4-cc33-11e1-839a-00144feabdc0\" title=\"\">Joseph Berkmann</a>, Duboeuf\u2019s British importer, and his friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/apr/16/clement-freud-obituary\" title=\"\">Clement Freud</a>, the chef and TV personality. This soon became enough of a media event to attract the participation of the racing driver Sir Stirling Moss, and even the RAF joined in, carrying bottles of nouveau in a Harrier jump jet. Other beaujolais producers participated in the race, but somehow it was Duboeuf who appeared in newspapers and television reports, personally seeing off the trucks as they left his cellars at midnight.</p> <p>He was born in the village of Cr\u00eaches-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, the youngest of three children of Antonia (nee Berthilier) and Jean-Claude Duboeuf. Georges never knew his father, who died when he was two. The business was taken over by his uncle and his brother, Roger, and, in his teens, Georges was given the task of delivering bottles by bicycle to customers in neighbouring villages.</p> <p>At the time, most of the region\u2019s producers sold their grapes to cooperatives, or wine in bulk to local merchants, and there was little connection between the ones who, like the Duboeufs, produced white wine from chardonnay grapes and those who made red beaujolais from the local gamay grape.</p> <p>Showing unusual entrepreneurial flair in a conservative wine region, Duboeuf began to bottle both styles of wine from other producers in the family cellar. Among his best customers were top-class local restaurants, and it was these relationships that helped him when, having bought out the other members of his family, he launched his eponymous brand.</p> <p>One reason his wines attracted so much attention was the masterstroke of giving them instantly recognisable floral labels that ensured they stood out on the shelf. But Duboeuf\u2019s understanding of the importance of distribution was also crucial to his success. His US importer Bill Deutsch cleverly capitalised on the fact that the release of the beaujolais nouveau coincided with Thanksgiving and he promoted the French wine as the natural accompaniment to the celebratory meal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/08/letter-georges-duboeuf-obituary\">Letter: Georges Duboeuf obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the 1970s and 80s, for a new generation of British and American consumers, beaujolais was a perfect introduction to wine: soft, juicy and far easier to drink than tough, tannic traditional red wines such as bordeaux and chianti. And beaujolais was almost synonymous with Duboeuf \u2013 Georges became known as the \u201cking\u201d or the \u201cpope\u201d of beaujolais.</p> <p>But if millions of bottles of simple, quaffable beaujolais nouveau helped Duboeuf\u2019s business to grow, he was just as interested in the more serious wines of his region. He was not only a big supporter of village appellations such as Fleurie, Morgon, St Amour and Moulin \u00e0 Vent, but also of individual vineyards in these villages that few of his competitors took seriously.</p> <p>While helping to promote the names of these wines, he also \u2013 unusually for a merchant \u2013 gave credit to some of the grape growers from whom he bought his wine.

      "bodyText": "Georges Duboeuf, who has died aged 86, was one of the giants of the international wine industry. Born into a family with four centuries\u2019 history of winemaking in Pouilly Fuiss\u00e9 in the south of Burgundy, Duboeuf launched his own brand, Les Vins Georges Duboeuf, in 1964. From the outset he had bigger ambitions than his neighbours, most of whom were happy to sell their wine fairly cheaply in nearby Lyon and Paris. Duboeuf not only wanted it to be listed in Michelin-starred restaurants across France, but also overseas. The key to achieving this lay in the tradition of releasing the latest vintage of beaujolais as nouveau \u2013 new \u2013 wine on the third Thursday in November each year, just a few weeks after the harvest. There are various versions of the history of the beaujolais nouveau race. According to one, it began as a competition to get the wine to the French capital, inspired by Duboeuf seeing a roughly painted sign on the window of a Paris bistro announcing that \u201cle beaujolais nouveau est arriv\u00e9\u201d. There is no question that the race to rush the wine to London began in 1970 as a private challenge between Joseph Berkmann, Duboeuf\u2019s British importer, and his friend Clement Freud, the chef and TV personality. This soon became enough of a media event to attract the participation of the racing driver Sir Stirling Moss, and even the RAF joined in, carrying bottles of nouveau in a Harrier jump jet. Other beaujolais producers participated in the race, but somehow it was Duboeuf who appeared in newspapers and television reports, personally seeing off the trucks as they left his cellars at midnight. He was born in the village of Cr\u00eaches-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, the youngest of three children of Antonia (nee Berthilier) and Jean-Claude Duboeuf. Georges never knew his father, who died when he was two. The business was taken over by his uncle and his brother, Roger, and, in his teens, Georges was given the task of delivering bottles by bicycle to customers in neighbouring villages. At the time, most of the region\u2019s producers sold their grapes to cooperatives, or wine in bulk to local merchants, and there was little connection between the ones who, like the Duboeufs, produced white wine from chardonnay grapes and those who made red beaujolais from the local gamay grape. Showing unusual entrepreneurial flair in a conservative wine region, Duboeuf began to bottle both styles of wine from other producers in the family cellar. Among his best customers were top-class local restaurants, and it was these relationships that helped him when, having bought out the other members of his family, he launched his eponymous brand. One reason his wines attracted so much attention was the masterstroke of giving them instantly recognisable floral labels that ensured they stood out on the shelf. But Duboeuf\u2019s understanding of the importance of distribution was also crucial to his success. His US importer Bill Deutsch cleverly capitalised on the fact that the release of the beaujolais nouveau coincided with Thanksgiving and he promoted the French wine as the natural accompaniment to the celebratory meal. In the 1970s and 80s, for a new generation of British and American consumers, beaujolais was a perfect introduction to wine: soft, juicy and far easier to drink than tough, tannic traditional red wines such as bordeaux and chianti. And beaujolais was almost synonymous with Duboeuf \u2013 Georges became known as the \u201cking\u201d or the \u201cpope\u201d of beaujolais. But if millions of bottles of simple, quaffable beaujolais nouveau helped Duboeuf\u2019s business to grow, he was just as interested in the more serious wines of his region. He was not only a big supporter of village appellations such as Fleurie, Morgon, St Amour and Moulin \u00e0 Vent, but also of individual vineyards in these villages that few of his competitors took seriously. While helping to promote the names of these wines, he also \u2013 unusually for a merchant \u2013 gave credit to some of the grape growers from whom he bought his wine. Every year he held a competition for the best wine of the vintage, inviting the winning growers to a banquet at the nearby Michelin three-star restaurant, Paul Bocuse, and featuring their names on the labels of his reserve bottlings. In everything he did, this quintessentially French wine producer learned from what he saw happening elsewhere. France was slow to introduce the kind of wine tourism that was developed in Napa Valley, California, but Duboeuf created Europe\u2019s most successful wine theme park, by taking over the former railway station in Roman\u00e8che Thorins, the village in which his cellars are situated. Since it opened in 1993, more than two million people have passed through its turnstiles. If people are now discovering the attractions of white wine produced from the viognier grape, this is partly thanks to Duboeuf\u2019s decision to plant it in the Ard\u00e8che region at a time when it seemed to be at risk of extinction. Today, wine drinkers take it for granted that delicious, easy-to-drink, cleverly branded wines are available from countries such as Australia and Chile, and from across Europe. It was Duboeuf and his eye-catching beaujolais that helped lay the foundations for their success. Duboeuf is survived by his wife, Rolande (nee Dudet), his son Franck, who has run the business since 2018, and his daughter, Fabienne. \u2022 Georges Duboeuf, wine producer, born 14 April 1933; died 4 January 2020",

He should know: he\u2019s a social media addict, compulsively tweeting witticisms and selfies, and waiting for the likes to flow. But where there are likes, there are trolls \u2013 on which subject, Baddiel has created this, the third of his mid-career standup/PowerPoint shows, following Fame: Not the Musical and the indelible My Family: Not the Sitcom. It\u2019s an entertaining primer in social media anthropology, leading us from weird to wonderful to \u201cthe absolute worst of humanity\u201d and back again. If it\u2019s not as memorable as its predecessors, that\u2019s because the internet\u2019s most odd and irate corners have been extensively mined by live comedians in recent years \u2013 Dave Gorman prominent among them \u2013 and because Baddiel\u2019s insights are seldom revelatory. There are points where the show feels like an elaborate excuse to recycle for a live audience\u2019s benefit all the funny things he\u2019s said on social media.

The film also won Oscars for best director, best screenplay and best international feature, adding to its successes at the Cannes Film Festival last year and the Baftas earlier this month. But it was the moment that Parasite was awarded best picture \u2013 a first for any non-English language film in the Oscars\u2019 92-year-history \u2013 that sparked outpourings of joy in Bong\u2019s native country. Some TV networks broke into their regular programming to bring news of the award, which many pundits had predicted would go to 1917. During a live broadcast of the ceremony on South Korean TV, the presenter had to apologise to viewers for screaming at the moment Parasite was named best picture. It was unlikely, though, that many South Koreans \u2013 consumed in recent weeks by news of the coronavirus outbreak - would be able to join Bong in celebrating with a drink, as news of his feats reached his compatriots at around lunchtime on Monday. The Oscars marked an incredible turnaround for Bong who, just a few years ago, was on a secret blacklist, compiled during the administration of the country\u2019s disgraced conservative president, Park Geun-hye, of thousands of South Korean artists and writers who espoused \u201cleftwing views\u201d.

In a Twitter post, Eugene Gu said that as an Asian-American he was \u201coverjoyed\u201d to see Parasite win best picture, but wondered why none of the actors in the film had even been nominated. \u201cIt\u2019s like being seen and erased simultaneously,\u201d Gu wrote.

      "body": "<p>For nearly 80 years since its postwar independence, Lebanon has been a haven for regional media, giving a platform to journalism and entertainment that few other countries in the Middle East would dare to match.</p> <p>Its newspapers set agendas, its TV stations tested boundaries, and its proprietors defied both war and downturn, producing content that challenged state narratives and tested the patience of the powerful.</p> <p>Then came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/25/lebanon-heads-for-meltdown-as-protesters-keep-returning-to-streets\">the meltdown</a> that could well end it all. In the past three months, a financial collapse that had long been predicted has obliterated revenues that were keeping much of Lebanese media on life support. Since then, popular radio stations have closed, newspapers have stopped paying staff, or slashed salaries, and once omnipotent TV networks have been left scrounging for foreign backers.</p> <p>So far in February alone, the only local English-language newspaper, the Daily Star, stopped its print run. A longstanding radio station closed, after nearly 40 years, and staff at a raft of other titles and stations were struggling to pay bills.</p> <p>The collapse has left much of the industry in freefall, and led a fresh wave of Lebanese to look abroad for opportunities. Having launched the careers of hundreds of the regional media\u2019s best practitioners \u2013 and some of its most impactful journalism \u2013 the sector itself faces a scramble to survive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d40e14b7faae1c9076d39e1269bb366451de07dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d40e14b7faae1c9076d39e1269bb366451de07dd/0_91_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Beirut newsstand in August 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Beirut newsstand in August 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Eid/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To some extent, Lebanese outlets have been buffeted by the same pressures that have taken media in other countries to the brink \u2013 the collapse of traditional advertising, the abandonment of old platforms, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/15/disinformation-the-online-threat-to-protest-in-the-middle-east\">mass migration to social media</a>, which does not pay the bills.</p> <p>But other factors stemming from widespread state dysfunction have meant Lebanon has been slow to adapt to new media models. \u201cLebanon is like an ostrich, we put our head in the sand and we didn\u2019t want to see it,\u201d said Pierre Daher, the chairman and CEO of the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cI mean, of course the government did not have this as an interest. Also they didn\u2019t have a specialist who would look at it.</p> <p>\u201cThis needed a national plan to do the transformation from regular media to new media; basically because the internet was key in this. We needed to go much faster when it comes to fibre optics, 5G, we needed to lower the prices. Internet is very expensive here. And we needed to put a plan for that industry, how to transform it.\u201d</p> <p>Alternative media platforms have been hugely popular ways to chronicle events on the country\u2019s combustible streets, as have pop-up online assets, low-cost substitutes that are providing content to younger generations of Lebanese \u2013 and to foreign networks that have used such footage to enhance their coverage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70048fe5e3b9e9f926e934de171d70fb118bd112\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70048fe5e3b9e9f926e934de171d70fb118bd112/0_94_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An anti-government protester waves a Lebanese flag during clashes with police outside parliament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An anti-government protester waves a Lebanese flag during clashes with police outside parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wael Hamzeh/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daher\u2019s network has been among the most influential in the country, and long accounted for about 40% of the television market. But neither it nor its competitors is the first port of call for young Lebanese. It faces an existential threat and is no longer paying full salaries to its staff.

      "bodyText": "For nearly 80 years since its postwar independence, Lebanon has been a haven for regional media, giving a platform to journalism and entertainment that few other countries in the Middle East would dare to match. Its newspapers set agendas, its TV stations tested boundaries, and its proprietors defied both war and downturn, producing content that challenged state narratives and tested the patience of the powerful. Then came the meltdown that could well end it all. In the past three months, a financial collapse that had long been predicted has obliterated revenues that were keeping much of Lebanese media on life support. Since then, popular radio stations have closed, newspapers have stopped paying staff, or slashed salaries, and once omnipotent TV networks have been left scrounging for foreign backers. So far in February alone, the only local English-language newspaper, the Daily Star, stopped its print run. A longstanding radio station closed, after nearly 40 years, and staff at a raft of other titles and stations were struggling to pay bills. The collapse has left much of the industry in freefall, and led a fresh wave of Lebanese to look abroad for opportunities. Having launched the careers of hundreds of the regional media\u2019s best practitioners \u2013 and some of its most impactful journalism \u2013 the sector itself faces a scramble to survive. To some extent, Lebanese outlets have been buffeted by the same pressures that have taken media in other countries to the brink \u2013 the collapse of traditional advertising, the abandonment of old platforms, and a mass migration to social media, which does not pay the bills. But other factors stemming from widespread state dysfunction have meant Lebanon has been slow to adapt to new media models. \u201cLebanon is like an ostrich, we put our head in the sand and we didn\u2019t want to see it,\u201d said Pierre Daher, the chairman and CEO of the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cI mean, of course the government did not have this as an interest. Also they didn\u2019t have a specialist who would look at it. \u201cThis needed a national plan to do the transformation from regular media to new media; basically because the internet was key in this. We needed to go much faster when it comes to fibre optics, 5G, we needed to lower the prices. Internet is very expensive here. And we needed to put a plan for that industry, how to transform it.\u201d Alternative media platforms have been hugely popular ways to chronicle events on the country\u2019s combustible streets, as have pop-up online assets, low-cost substitutes that are providing content to younger generations of Lebanese \u2013 and to foreign networks that have used such footage to enhance their coverage. Daher\u2019s network has been among the most influential in the country, and long accounted for about 40% of the television market. But neither it nor its competitors is the first port of call for young Lebanese. It faces an existential threat and is no longer paying full salaries to its staff. Its revenues largely stemmed from advertising or sponsorship from local businesses \u2013 nearly all of which has stopped since anti-government protests beginning in October left an already failing economy on life support. \u201cWe knew 2019 could not end on a positive note,\u201d he said. \u201cWe already saw in quarter one and two a decline of almost 35% in terms of revenue. The decline that happened in the last three months is around 80%. \u201cOn the other hand, the media outlets in Lebanon, whether it\u2019s newspapers or TV, they still believed that good times were there and they could continue as they were. They didn\u2019t see it coming or they didn\u2019t want to see it coming.\u201d The Lebanese uprising has been of huge interest to its people, who are now enduring restrictions on access to their savings, widespread layoffs, and soaring inflation. Nabil Bou Monsef, the deputy editor-in-chief of An-Nahar newspaper, said: \u201cWe are facing an unprecedented media crisis in Lebanon.

      "body": "<p>We ought to be talking about Verona. We ought to be talking about an astonishing week for the club with the lowest wage bill in Serie A, in which they drew with Milan and Lazio before beating the champions, and league leaders, Juventus.

Still, Sunday\u2019s game felt different. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/european-football-roundup-bayer-leverkusen-borussia-dortmund-lars-bender-atalanta-getafe\">Verona\u2019s win over Juventus</a> had offered the <em>Nerazzurri</em> an opportunity to pull level with Juventus in first place. Not since 2010 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/may/23/inter-champions-league-mourinho-real\">the year they won the treble </a>\u2013 had Inter been top of Serie A so far into a campaign.</p> \n<p>Milan, though, were on the rise as well. Unbeaten in 2020, they had won five straight before their draw with Verona. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/26/zlatan-ibrahimovic-agrees-deal-to-return-to-milan-on-initial-six-month-contract\">signing of Ibrahimovic</a> in January galvanised them, restoring enthusiasm among fans, and perhaps the players themselves, as well as providing a much-needed focal point to the attack.</p> \n<p>For 45 minutes, he dominated this derby. Named as a lone striker, Ibrahimovic used his size and aggression to force Inter\u2019s defensive line into retreat: creating spaces for teammates to flood into. Hakan Calhanoglu hit the post after finding room to let fly from 20 yards. Ante Rebic opened the scoring from an Ibrahimovic knockdown.</p> \n<p>The Swede himself made it 2-0, heading home at the back post after Franck Kessi\u00e9 flicked the ball on at a corner. It was his seventh goal in this fixture, with the first dating back to 2006, when he was playing for Inter. He celebrated with a kiss toward former fans in the Curva Nord.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1226606237644656643\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udd34\u26ab ZLATAN MAKES IT 2-0!<br><br>\ud83d\ude2e AC Milan strike again just before half time, and Ibrahimovi\u0107's header adds to Padelli's first half to forget<br><br>\ud83d\udd35\u26ab Conte's Inter have a lot to figure out at the break <a href=\"https://t.co/8aQm1yp3Rr\">pic.twitter.com/8aQm1yp3Rr</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1226606237644656643?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 9, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Inter looked sunk. They had not overcome a two-goal deficit against their city rivals since the 1940s, and were being comfortably outplayed. By abandoning his usual 4-4-2, the Milan manager, Stefano Pioli, had freed up a man in midfield. Calhanoglu was dropping on to Marcelo Brozovic when his team lost possession, disrupting Inter\u2019s attempts to launch the fast breaks Conte desires.</p> \n<p>It was easy to imagine Inter\u2019s manager tearing into his players in the changing room. This is the man who, according to Andrea Pirlo, used to hurl full bottles of sparkling water by players\u2019 heads in Turin.</p> \n<p>Yet Conte would paint a very different picture of what went down on Sunday. \u201cThere was no need to talk much,\u201d he claimed at full time. \u201cIn difficult situations everybody needs to take responsibility for their own mistakes. I was the first one responsible. But you get out of these situations by staying compact as a team.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/10/leipzig-bayern-munich-respect-title-race-bundesliga-roundup\">Leipzig dig in to earn Bayern Munich's respect and keep title race on the boil | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That, and with moments of individual brilliance. No sooner had play resumed, than Brozovic brought Inter back to life with a glorious volley into the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Within two minutes, they were level. Alexis S\u00e1nchez ran on to a through-ball from Diego God\u00edn before cutting the ball back to Mat\u00edas Vecino, who dispatched it first-time into the bottom corner.</p> \n<p>By now, Inter were only a thumping dance-track away from transforming into a YouTube highlights reel. Stefan de Vrij put them in front with a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1226617219817320448\">header that defied physics</a>, bowing down to shin height to divert a corner across his own body and over Gianluigi Donnarumma. That might not even have been the best goal of the night, if <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1226619722474704906\">Christian Eriksen\u2019s 30-yard free-kick </a>had dipped a fraction lower on its way to striking the inside junction of post and crossbar.</p> \n<p>Still, Inter could have blown it. Ibrahimovic hit the post with a header in the 89th minute, before Lukaku finally put the result beyond doubt. As Gazzetta dello Sport\u2019s match report would observe on Monday morning: \u201cOn the night of the Oscars, there could not have been a more Hollywood way to pull level with Juventus at the top.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1226624835687714816\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udd35\u26ab Here's how Lukaku made it 4-2!<br><br>\ud83d\udc4f A night that the Nerazzurri will remember for a very long time! <a href=\"https://t.co/InF3wZrHRe\">pic.twitter.com/InF3wZrHRe</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1226624835687714816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 9, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>This title race has already brought us more twists and turns than many movies proposed for an Academy award.

Milan, despite their improvement, remain a long way short of Serie A\u2019s best. Yet Inter can draw encouragement from the character they showed to recover from a disastrous start while missing a pair of key players. Lukaku led the line well without his usual strike partner, Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, but their goalkeeper Daniele Padelli, replacing the injured Samir Handanovic, was at fault for both Milan\u2019s goals.</p> \n<p>Conte insisted afterwards it was still too early to talk of the title. In Turin, it is a year-round topic of conversation. Defeat to Verona was a catastrophe for Juventus, and all the more so for the fact that they had been 1-0 up deep into the second half. This was their first loss in a game that they led in the 75th minute since Conte himself was in charge.</p> \n<p>There is much to be said about their failings, about the scant evidence of the fluid football that Maurizio Sarri was supposed to bring, and the fact that they are failing to capitalise during a period when Cristiano Ronaldo is on fire \u2013 marking 10 consecutive games with at least one goal.</p> \n<p>But it would be wrong to close out this column focusing on Juventus\u2019s shortcomings, when there is still so much more to be said about Verona. Where Inter could call on the likes of Brozovic and Lukaku to author their comeback, Hellas\u2019s goals were scored by Fabio Borini and a 35-year-old Giampaolo Pazzini.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1226258349165031425\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\ude31 UNBELIEVABLE SCENES IN VERONA!<br><br>\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc99 Pazzini converts the penalty, and Hellas Verona have come from behind to lead Juventus 2-1! <a href=\"https://t.co/bCkiReVVdu\">pic.twitter.com/bCkiReVVdu</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1226258349165031425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 8, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Ivan Juric has done an astonishing job of moulding a team from a group of cast-offs, loanees and relative unknowns. Some of those \u2013 such as the Moroccan midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, who will join Fiorentina in the summer \u2013 look destined for bigger things. Most, like Pazzini, are simply role players being put in position to extract the best of what they have.</p> \n<p>The character of this team is extraordinary. On 15 December, Verona were 3-0 down to Torino in the 69th minute, and came back to take a point. Since then, they have not lost. They are ahead of Milan and Napoli, and have conceded fewer goals than anyone outside the top three. A European berth could even be in reach.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor now we are just trying to reach 40 points and safety,\u201d insisted Juric.

      "bodyText": "We ought to be talking about Verona. We ought to be talking about an astonishing week for the club with the lowest wage bill in Serie A, in which they drew with Milan and Lazio before beating the champions, and league leaders, Juventus. We ought to be talking about how a newly promoted side went from battling relegation to sixth place, via an eight-game unbeaten run, inspired by a manager with a passion for death metal. But then, Sunday night happened. A Milan derby played to a full house at San Siro. Flares, banners, and thousands of supporters lighting up their mobile phones in unison to spell out the message \u201cInter Merda\u201d (\u201cInter are shit\u201d). Zlatan Ibrahimovic versus Romelu Lukaku, a comeback for the ages, and the emphatic renewal of a title challenge that looked like it might be about to fall apart. This has always been a fixture unto itself: retaining its sense of occasion even in those years when both Inter and Milan were languishing in mid-table. Still, Sunday\u2019s game felt different. Verona\u2019s win over Juventus had offered the Nerazzurri an opportunity to pull level with Juventus in first place. Not since 2010 \u2013 the year they won the treble \u2013 had Inter been top of Serie A so far into a campaign. Milan, though, were on the rise as well. Unbeaten in 2020, they had won five straight before their draw with Verona. The signing of Ibrahimovic in January galvanised them, restoring enthusiasm among fans, and perhaps the players themselves, as well as providing a much-needed focal point to the attack. For 45 minutes, he dominated this derby. Named as a lone striker, Ibrahimovic used his size and aggression to force Inter\u2019s defensive line into retreat: creating spaces for teammates to flood into. Hakan Calhanoglu hit the post after finding room to let fly from 20 yards. Ante Rebic opened the scoring from an Ibrahimovic knockdown. The Swede himself made it 2-0, heading home at the back post after Franck Kessi\u00e9 flicked the ball on at a corner. It was his seventh goal in this fixture, with the first dating back to 2006, when he was playing for Inter. He celebrated with a kiss toward former fans in the Curva Nord. Inter looked sunk. They had not overcome a two-goal deficit against their city rivals since the 1940s, and were being comfortably outplayed. By abandoning his usual 4-4-2, the Milan manager, Stefano Pioli, had freed up a man in midfield. Calhanoglu was dropping on to Marcelo Brozovic when his team lost possession, disrupting Inter\u2019s attempts to launch the fast breaks Conte desires. It was easy to imagine Inter\u2019s manager tearing into his players in the changing room. This is the man who, according to Andrea Pirlo, used to hurl full bottles of sparkling water by players\u2019 heads in Turin. Yet Conte would paint a very different picture of what went down on Sunday. \u201cThere was no need to talk much,\u201d he claimed at full time. \u201cIn difficult situations everybody needs to take responsibility for their own mistakes. I was the first one responsible. But you get out of these situations by staying compact as a team.\u201d That, and with moments of individual brilliance. No sooner had play resumed, than Brozovic brought Inter back to life with a glorious volley into the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Within two minutes, they were level. Alexis S\u00e1nchez ran on to a through-ball from Diego God\u00edn before cutting the ball back to Mat\u00edas Vecino, who dispatched it first-time into the bottom corner. By now, Inter were only a thumping dance-track away from transforming into a YouTube highlights reel. Stefan de Vrij put them in front with a header that defied physics, bowing down to shin height to divert a corner across his own body and over Gianluigi Donnarumma. That might not even have been the best goal of the night, if Christian Eriksen\u2019s 30-yard free-kick had dipped a fraction lower on its way to striking the inside junction of post and crossbar. Still, Inter could have blown it. Ibrahimovic hit the post with a header in the 89th minute, before Lukaku finally put the result beyond doubt. As Gazzetta dello Sport\u2019s match report would observe on Monday morning: \u201cOn the night of the Oscars, there could not have been a more Hollywood way to pull level with Juventus at the top.\u201d This title race has already brought us more twists and turns than many movies proposed for an Academy award. Lazio\u2019s win over Parma on Sunday means there is now just one point separating the top three. The Biancocelesti host Inter in Rome next weekend. That should be a sterner test still. Milan, despite their improvement, remain a long way short of Serie A\u2019s best. Yet Inter can draw encouragement from the character they showed to recover from a disastrous start while missing a pair of key players. Lukaku led the line well without his usual strike partner, Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, but their goalkeeper Daniele Padelli, replacing the injured Samir Handanovic, was at fault for both Milan\u2019s goals. Conte insisted afterwards it was still too early to talk of the title. In Turin, it is a year-round topic of conversation. Defeat to Verona was a catastrophe for Juventus, and all the more so for the fact that they had been 1-0 up deep into the second half. This was their first loss in a game that they led in the 75th minute since Conte himself was in charge. There is much to be said about their failings, about the scant evidence of the fluid football that Maurizio Sarri was supposed to bring, and the fact that they are failing to capitalise during a period when Cristiano Ronaldo is on fire \u2013 marking 10 consecutive games with at least one goal. But it would be wrong to close out this column focusing on Juventus\u2019s shortcomings, when there is still so much more to be said about Verona. Where Inter could call on the likes of Brozovic and Lukaku to author their comeback, Hellas\u2019s goals were scored by Fabio Borini and a 35-year-old Giampaolo Pazzini. Ivan Juric has done an astonishing job of moulding a team from a group of cast-offs, loanees and relative unknowns. Some of those \u2013 such as the Moroccan midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, who will join Fiorentina in the summer \u2013 look destined for bigger things. Most, like Pazzini, are simply role players being put in position to extract the best of what they have. The character of this team is extraordinary. On 15 December, Verona were 3-0 down to Torino in the 69th minute, and came back to take a point. Since then, they have not lost. They are ahead of Milan and Napoli, and have conceded fewer goals than anyone outside the top three. A European berth could even be in reach. \u201cFor now we are just trying to reach 40 points and safety,\u201d insisted Juric. The fans who sang about winning the Scudetto at full time might, light-heartedly, disagree.",

For that reason Fianna F\u00e1il will hesitate to do a deal with Fine Gael. But Fianna F\u00e1il may oust Martin if he does not become taoiseach. One plausible outcome: deadlock, and another election.

      "body": "<p>\u201cThere was a lot in it but at the same time,\u201d said Thomas M\u00fcller, \u201cthere was nothing in it.\u201d One of Bayern\u2019s very sharpest minds (and tongues) hit the nail on the head for the umpteenth time in a career every bit as interesting off the pitch as it has been on it. As Munich waited for a storm to brew, meteorologically as well as metaphorically, the Bundesliga\u2019s big clash of the season to date simultaneously gave and took away, delivered and let down, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/09/european-roundup-bayern-leipzig-milan-derby\">satisfied and left you hungry for more</a>.</p> \n<p>It felt as if the whole occasion had been set up to blindside you, from the scheduling \u2013 unquestionably the standout game of the weekend being left to last, unusually for Germany, and the 1800 Sunday timeslot \u2013 through the teams\u2019 respective preparations, right down to the chronology of the match itself. At the end of it we didn\u2019t quite have the spectacular that we wanted, but we did have a title race fully intact.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/09/european-roundup-bayern-leipzig-milan-derby\">European roundup: Bayern Munich held at home by RB Leipzig</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The fear, for neutral and non-Bayern fans, of that not being the case had been clear in the days and weeks building up to it. As Leipzig faltered and flustered in recent weeks, looking far from their confident selves and letting five league points and a place in the DfB Pokal slip through their grasp, it seemed as if they were arriving to face Bayern \u2013 in a stadium where they\u2019d never so much as taken a point \u2013 at just the wrong time. Behind that assured exterior even Julian Nagelsmann, who had very publicly admonished, questioned and encouraged his team as is his way, must surely have had his own doubts.</p> \n<p>In the first 45 minutes, it looked as if those fears were absolutely on the money, and that the script was an altogether familiar one. At times in that first half it felt as if the visitors\u2019 defensive lynchpin Dayot Upamecano was the only thing standing between Bayern and a typical Allianz Arena procession, holding back an insistent tide with a Herculean display of fortitude. If there are people who believe he\u2019s not at least agonisingly close to being the Bundesliga\u2019s best defender, then they wouldn\u2019t have been in the Allianz on Sunday.</p> \n<p>Maybe those tough opening moments could be the passage of play that changed something masquerading as a title race into the real deal. \u201cWith how we approached the first 20 minutes,\u201d Timo Werner later reflected with more than a touch of his coach\u2019s candour, \u201cit was actually only a matter of time before we were behind.\u201d While Upamecano stretched every sinew and Peter Gulacsi did his thing, denying Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara and Robert Lewandowski without fuss, there was an awakening, exactly as their manager had hoped.</p> \n<p>Nagelsmann had done his thinking - but he had not overthought things, like so many who have fallen by the wayside here before. \u201cBayern expected us to be high up the pitch,\u201d he explained, \u201cso we wanted to play a bit deeper and play on the counter-attack.\u201d The plan wasn\u2019t quite executed to precision in those early stages, he admitted, or to be \u201cquite as deep as we actually were,\u201d but it eventually gave his team more freedom.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c10097373b86f86420a3c37a9dfd3999ad1b16dc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c10097373b86f86420a3c37a9dfd3999ad1b16dc/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bayern Munich fans show their support for their team at the Allianz Arena.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bayern Munich fans show their support for their team at the Allianz Arena.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreas Gebert/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And that second half was the twist in the tale. It wasn\u2019t as pronounced as it might have been had Marcel Sabitzer and Werner taken golden chances as Leipzig created a flurry at the start of a second period and attacked with gusto. </p> \n<p>\u201cIn the second half,\u201d wrote Christoph Kneer in S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, \u201ca game developed that represented the current top of the league. The new money from Leipzig fought back and were a bit cheeky, while Bayern\u2019s old money felt challenged and tried to defend their status. Bayern might be light years ahead of Dortmund and Leipzig but games like this show them that they have to stay vigilant and make smart decisions. Simply buying Leipzig\u2019s best won\u2019t work. Leipzig don\u2019t need the money.\u201d</p> \n<p>Others spoke of a level of genuine competition giving Bayern a greater chance to realise their European dreams, keeping them on their toes unlike in many previous seasons, give or take Dortmund\u2019s near miss last term. \u201cYou had the feeling from the 70th minute that nobody wanted to go all in,\u201d M\u00fcller suggested. That level of mutual respect offers potential satisfaction going forward that surpasses an afternoon with no goals, and that may well not just blow over.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 This should have been the weekend when Dortmund took advantage of the top two playing each other to close the gap, but the ceiling fell in, as it has threatened too ever since the Winterpause ended, with BVB on the wrong end of a seven-goal thriller at Leverkusen. There was much to like about their attacking play \u2013 including a stupendous debut goal for Emre Can \u2013 but having led 2-1 and 3-2, they conceded twice in 82 seconds in the final 10 minutes to go home with nothing. \u201cWe\u2019re conceding too many goals,\u201d lamented sporting director Michael Zorc, \u201cand that\u2019s why we\u2019re not in a better position.\u201d After leaking seven goals in the last two games during a week which also saw BVB exit the Pokal, Zorc isn\u2019t joking.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1226206023746281475\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Outrageous from Emre Can!

The feeling in Peter Bosz\u2019s dressing room was that Die Werkself leapt an important mental barrier with their comeback \u2013 especially after they got past the blow of Kai Havertz hitting a post when clean through at 2-2, only for Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro to go back up the other end to give the visitors the lead. \u201cThere have been games where we\u2019ve been broken by things like that,\u201d said two-goal Kevin Volland.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Werder Bremen had hoped their stirring Pokal win over Dortmund in the week would be a turning point, but they slipped back into more Weserstadion misery as Union played their way to an excellent 2-0 win on the back of Marius B\u00fclter\u2019s superbly taken brace. Sporting director Frank Baumann again defended Florian Kohfeldt as Werder slipped into the bottom two, and turned his ire on to the players. \u201cWe are all responsible,\u201d Baumann said emphatically, \u201cbut first and foremost, the team is responsible.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2a660be7-9ada-4c40-9761-8b49e92068b6\"

      "bodyText": "\u201cThere was a lot in it but at the same time,\u201d said Thomas M\u00fcller, \u201cthere was nothing in it.\u201d One of Bayern\u2019s very sharpest minds (and tongues) hit the nail on the head for the umpteenth time in a career every bit as interesting off the pitch as it has been on it. As Munich waited for a storm to brew, meteorologically as well as metaphorically, the Bundesliga\u2019s big clash of the season to date simultaneously gave and took away, delivered and let down, satisfied and left you hungry for more. It felt as if the whole occasion had been set up to blindside you, from the scheduling \u2013 unquestionably the standout game of the weekend being left to last, unusually for Germany, and the 1800 Sunday timeslot \u2013 through the teams\u2019 respective preparations, right down to the chronology of the match itself. At the end of it we didn\u2019t quite have the spectacular that we wanted, but we did have a title race fully intact. The fear, for neutral and non-Bayern fans, of that not being the case had been clear in the days and weeks building up to it. As Leipzig faltered and flustered in recent weeks, looking far from their confident selves and letting five league points and a place in the DfB Pokal slip through their grasp, it seemed as if they were arriving to face Bayern \u2013 in a stadium where they\u2019d never so much as taken a point \u2013 at just the wrong time. Behind that assured exterior even Julian Nagelsmann, who had very publicly admonished, questioned and encouraged his team as is his way, must surely have had his own doubts. In the first 45 minutes, it looked as if those fears were absolutely on the money, and that the script was an altogether familiar one. At times in that first half it felt as if the visitors\u2019 defensive lynchpin Dayot Upamecano was the only thing standing between Bayern and a typical Allianz Arena procession, holding back an insistent tide with a Herculean display of fortitude. If there are people who believe he\u2019s not at least agonisingly close to being the Bundesliga\u2019s best defender, then they wouldn\u2019t have been in the Allianz on Sunday. Maybe those tough opening moments could be the passage of play that changed something masquerading as a title race into the real deal. \u201cWith how we approached the first 20 minutes,\u201d Timo Werner later reflected with more than a touch of his coach\u2019s candour, \u201cit was actually only a matter of time before we were behind.\u201d While Upamecano stretched every sinew and Peter Gulacsi did his thing, denying Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara and Robert Lewandowski without fuss, there was an awakening, exactly as their manager had hoped. Nagelsmann had done his thinking - but he had not overthought things, like so many who have fallen by the wayside here before. \u201cBayern expected us to be high up the pitch,\u201d he explained, \u201cso we wanted to play a bit deeper and play on the counter-attack.\u201d The plan wasn\u2019t quite executed to precision in those early stages, he admitted, or to be \u201cquite as deep as we actually were,\u201d but it eventually gave his team more freedom. And that second half was the twist in the tale. It wasn\u2019t as pronounced as it might have been had Marcel Sabitzer and Werner taken golden chances as Leipzig created a flurry at the start of a second period and attacked with gusto. \u201cIn the second half,\u201d wrote Christoph Kneer in S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, \u201ca game developed that represented the current top of the league. The new money from Leipzig fought back and were a bit cheeky, while Bayern\u2019s old money felt challenged and tried to defend their status. Bayern might be light years ahead of Dortmund and Leipzig but games like this show them that they have to stay vigilant and make smart decisions. Simply buying Leipzig\u2019s best won\u2019t work. Leipzig don\u2019t need the money.\u201d Others spoke of a level of genuine competition giving Bayern a greater chance to realise their European dreams, keeping them on their toes unlike in many previous seasons, give or take Dortmund\u2019s near miss last term. \u201cYou had the feeling from the 70th minute that nobody wanted to go all in,\u201d M\u00fcller suggested. That level of mutual respect offers potential satisfaction going forward that surpasses an afternoon with no goals, and that may well not just blow over. Talking points \u2022 This should have been the weekend when Dortmund took advantage of the top two playing each other to close the gap, but the ceiling fell in, as it has threatened too ever since the Winterpause ended, with BVB on the wrong end of a seven-goal thriller at Leverkusen. There was much to like about their attacking play \u2013 including a stupendous debut goal for Emre Can \u2013 but having led 2-1 and 3-2, they conceded twice in 82 seconds in the final 10 minutes to go home with nothing. \u201cWe\u2019re conceding too many goals,\u201d lamented sporting director Michael Zorc, \u201cand that\u2019s why we\u2019re not in a better position.\u201d After leaking seven goals in the last two games during a week which also saw BVB exit the Pokal, Zorc isn\u2019t joking. \u2022 For Leverkusen, it was a huge boost as they reignited their drive towards the top four. The feeling in Peter Bosz\u2019s dressing room was that Die Werkself leapt an important mental barrier with their comeback \u2013 especially after they got past the blow of Kai Havertz hitting a post when clean through at 2-2, only for Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro to go back up the other end to give the visitors the lead. \u201cThere have been games where we\u2019ve been broken by things like that,\u201d said two-goal Kevin Volland. \u2022 Werder Bremen had hoped their stirring Pokal win over Dortmund in the week would be a turning point, but they slipped back into more Weserstadion misery as Union played their way to an excellent 2-0 win on the back of Marius B\u00fclter\u2019s superbly taken brace. Sporting director Frank Baumann again defended Florian Kohfeldt as Werder slipped into the bottom two, and turned his ire on to the players. \u201cWe are all responsible,\u201d Baumann said emphatically, \u201cbut first and foremost, the team is responsible.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Brussels is clamping down on 82 free ports or free zones after identifying that their special tariff and duty status has aided the financing of terrorism, money laundering and organised crime. A set of new rules was introduced by the European commission just weeks before the launch on Monday of a UK government consultation on the creation of up to 10 free ports in post-Brexit Britain. Authorities across the EU have been obliged since 10 January to take extra measures to identify and report suspicious activities at the ports and zones as a result of the \u201chigh incidence of corruption, tax evasion, criminal activity\u201d. The EU\u2019s executive branch has said it will review the issue again next year owing to the popularity of such ports among high-net-worth individuals and criminal organisations seeking to circumvent recent crackdowns on bank secrecy. Free ports or free zones are a type of special economic zone (SEZ) where business and trade laws differ from those in the rest of the country. Goods can be landed, stored, handled, manufactured or reconfigured and re-exported without being subject to customs duty. Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the UK Treasury, inaccurately claimed on Monday that \u201cthe EU is pretty much the only place in the world that doesn\u2019t use free ports\u201d. In reality, the EU\u2019s customs code does allow for free ports or zones and there are 82 of them across the countries that are subject to its regulations.

      "body": "<p>The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, failed in his \u201cduty of candour\u201d by not disclosing to the family of Harry Dunn that Anne Sacoolas, the American woman charged with causing the 19-year-old\u2019s death by dangerous driving, had previously been a CIA agent, the spokesman for the family, Radd Seiger, has said.</p> <p>He also disclosed that the constituency MP and business secretary Andrea Leadsom had not been told of Sacoolas\u2019s status by cabinet colleagues and was at a loss for words when informed by the family at the weekend.</p> <p>Sacoolas has been charged by the UK Crown Prosecution Service with causing Dunn\u2019s death by dangerous driving in August, but soon after the accident she was flown out of the country along with her husband and family. A UK government request to extradite her has been rejected by the US state department.</p> <p>It was revealed by the Mail on Sunday at the weekend that Sacoolas had previously been a high-ranking CIA officer, although at the time of the accident, it was her husband, also a CIA officer, that was listed as a diplomat, conferring immunity on him and his family.</p> <p>Sacoolas and her husband were both living at RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire when the accident occurred, and the Foreign Office said that as a spouse of a CIA officer at the base, she too enjoyed immunity.</p> <p>The revelation that she had also been a CIA officer, albeit not serving, helps explain the US government\u2019s refusal to grant the UK government request for her to be extradited to stand trial.</p> <p>The Foreign Office has not formally confirmed that Sacoolas worked for the CIA, and it is likely British officials would regard it as improper to disclose the identity of CIA agents to members of the British public even in this highly sensitive and unusual situation.</p> <p>Seiger said the family had asked Raab directly whether there was anything in Sacoolas\u2019s background that could explain the US government determination to protect her. According to Seiger, he said she was a former state department employee, a form of words that masked the motive for the US government determination to keep her out of the courts.</p> <p>Harry Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, sent BBC Radio 5 live a message in which she said: \u201cMy life is in pieces. Anne Sacoolas has destroyed my life as I knew it while she is carrying on with hers. It is deeply, deeply upsetting and totally wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Seiger said: \u201cThe news had floored the family since it was a question they had been asking of the Foreign Office directly. The parents have looked Dominic Raab directly in the eye and asked him across a table: is she more than a spouse? I am afraid he has failed in his duty of candour.\u201d</p> <p>Seiger said Raab merely confirmed she had worked for the state department, but he added: \u201cWorking for the state department and being a CIA officer are in my mind two completely different things, and totally germane to the issue.</p> <p>\u201cFor the foreign secretary not to tell us what the true position is, and to hear it from a newspaper is just jaw-dropping because you are trying to build a relationship with the government. But relationships are built on trust and trust is built on truth. If the parents ask him a question he is duty bound to answer it openly and honestly.\u201d</p> <p>He accused the government of trying to suppress information, and so leave the anguished family for months in the dark.</p> <p>Seiger added: \u201cThe Ministry of Defence is clearly not talking to the Foreign Office and the Foreign Office is not talking to our constituency MP Andrea Leadsom.</p> <p>He said of Leadsom: \u201cI don\u2019t think she knows what to say. You cannot have a situation where you are finding things out through the press when the government should be talking to you.\u201d</p> <p>He added Sacoolas had previously been in the UK between 2013 and 2015.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, failed in his \u201cduty of candour\u201d by not disclosing to the family of Harry Dunn that Anne Sacoolas, the American woman charged with causing the 19-year-old\u2019s death by dangerous driving, had previously been a CIA agent, the spokesman for the family, Radd Seiger, has said. He also disclosed that the constituency MP and business secretary Andrea Leadsom had not been told of Sacoolas\u2019s status by cabinet colleagues and was at a loss for words when informed by the family at the weekend. Sacoolas has been charged by the UK Crown Prosecution Service with causing Dunn\u2019s death by dangerous driving in August, but soon after the accident she was flown out of the country along with her husband and family. A UK government request to extradite her has been rejected by the US state department. It was revealed by the Mail on Sunday at the weekend that Sacoolas had previously been a high-ranking CIA officer, although at the time of the accident, it was her husband, also a CIA officer, that was listed as a diplomat, conferring immunity on him and his family. Sacoolas and her husband were both living at RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire when the accident occurred, and the Foreign Office said that as a spouse of a CIA officer at the base, she too enjoyed immunity. The revelation that she had also been a CIA officer, albeit not serving, helps explain the US government\u2019s refusal to grant the UK government request for her to be extradited to stand trial. The Foreign Office has not formally confirmed that Sacoolas worked for the CIA, and it is likely British officials would regard it as improper to disclose the identity of CIA agents to members of the British public even in this highly sensitive and unusual situation. Seiger said the family had asked Raab directly whether there was anything in Sacoolas\u2019s background that could explain the US government determination to protect her. According to Seiger, he said she was a former state department employee, a form of words that masked the motive for the US government determination to keep her out of the courts. Harry Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, sent BBC Radio 5 live a message in which she said: \u201cMy life is in pieces. Anne Sacoolas has destroyed my life as I knew it while she is carrying on with hers. It is deeply, deeply upsetting and totally wrong.\u201d Seiger said: \u201cThe news had floored the family since it was a question they had been asking of the Foreign Office directly. The parents have looked Dominic Raab directly in the eye and asked him across a table: is she more than a spouse? I am afraid he has failed in his duty of candour.\u201d Seiger said Raab merely confirmed she had worked for the state department, but he added: \u201cWorking for the state department and being a CIA officer are in my mind two completely different things, and totally germane to the issue. \u201cFor the foreign secretary not to tell us what the true position is, and to hear it from a newspaper is just jaw-dropping because you are trying to build a relationship with the government. But relationships are built on trust and trust is built on truth. If the parents ask him a question he is duty bound to answer it openly and honestly.\u201d He accused the government of trying to suppress information, and so leave the anguished family for months in the dark. Seiger added: \u201cThe Ministry of Defence is clearly not talking to the Foreign Office and the Foreign Office is not talking to our constituency MP Andrea Leadsom. He said of Leadsom: \u201cI don\u2019t think she knows what to say. You cannot have a situation where you are finding things out through the press when the government should be talking to you.\u201d He added Sacoolas had previously been in the UK between 2013 and 2015.",

Academy Awards veer off script with a thrilling twist ending Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Parasite was the unexpected victor at the 92nd Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday. The South Korean production is the first foreign-language film to win best picture, with Bong also claiming Oscars for best director, best international feature and best original screenplay. The rest of the winners\u2019 list went largely to form, with acting prizes going to Joaquin Phoenix (Joker), Ren\u00e9e Zellweger (Judy), Laura Dern (Marriage Story) and Brad Pitt (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). Welcome change. Peter Bradshaw says Parasite\u2019s win shows Hollywood is at last opening its mind to the outside world. Taika Waititi, who won the best adapted screenplay Oscar for Jojo Rabbit, dedicated his win to aspiring Indigenous storytellers. Post-ballgown looks.

WHO warns confirmed coronavirus cases \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019 The head of the World Health Organization has warned that international cases of the coronavirus among people who have never travelled to China \u201cmay indicate more widespread transmission in other countries\u201d. It came as China prepared to return to work on Monday following the extended lunar new year holiday. China\u2019s death toll has jumped to 908, with 40,000 confirmed infections, while a further 60 cases have been confirmed onboard a quarantined cruise ship in Japan. Missing journalist. Chen Qiushi, a citizen journalist and human rights advocate who was reporting from the heart of the outbreak in Wuhan, has gone missing \u2013 prompting claims the Chinese authorities may have silenced another whistleblower. Global economy. China plays an outsized role in today\u2019s world economy, which means the financial fallout from the coronavirus crisis could be large and long-lasting, writes Philip Inman.

Pete Buttigieg still leads the Vermont senator by two state delegates at the latest count, but the results are still considered somewhat unreliable. A recanvass is not a recount, but a check of the existing vote count to make certain that the results were tallied correctly. New Hampshire. Sanders remains the favourite in New Hampshire, with Joe Biden stepping up his attacks on his rival\u2019s democratic socialism as the former vice-president struggles to regain frontrunner status in the national race. Cheat sheet Sinn F\u00e9in, the former political wing of the IRA, is celebrating an electoral \u201crevolution\u201d in Ireland, where its leaders say they will attempt to form a governing coalition after winning more votes than any other party in the country\u2019s general election. Angela Merkel\u2019s designated successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, is not planning to run for the chancellorship in Germany at the next federal election and plans to step down as the leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union. A hitman suspected of involvement in the murder of Brazilian politician Marielle Franco, who had close links with the family of president Jair Bolsonaro, has been shot dead by police in the country\u2019s Bahia state. Trump has decried a photo showing him with a stark forehead tan line as \u201cfake news\u201d, while Twitter and Facebook refused to remove a video posted by the president, which misleadingly shows Nancy Pelosi repeatedly tearing up his State of the Union speech. Bill Gates is doing his bit for the environment by commissioning the world\u2019s first hydrogen-powered superyacht, worth an estimated $644m and featuring an infinity pool, helipad and spa. Must-reads The food fuelling the Democrats\u2019 2020 campaigns The presidential race is the political equivalent of an ultra-marathon, so how do the campaigns sustain their staff during this feat of endurance? As Julia Carrie Wong discovers, the Sanders and Warren campaigns are notably diverse in their dining choices, while Michael Bloomberg\u2019s spent $16,877 at a single sushi restaurant. The rise of climate anxiety While the physical impact of the climate crisis is becoming impossible to ignore, it is also taking its toll on people\u2019s mental wellbeing. Now climate scientists are recruiting psychologists to help tackle the trauma caused by ecological breakdown, as Matthew Taylor and Jessica Murray report. Why comic-book movies are ditching gloomy monochrome From Birds of Prey to Wonder Woman 1984, the latest batch of superhero blockbusters is getting rid of the gloomy, realistic greys in favour of a vibrant riot of colour. It\u2019s of a piece with the genre\u2019s fresh outlook, writes Steve Rose. India\u2019s ancient tribes fight the spread of mining A set of newly approved mining projects in central India could wipe out swathes of the Hasdeo Arand forest, threatening elephants, leopards, sloths and the biodiversity on which local villagers depend. Brian Cassey documents their efforts to protect their ancestral homelands. Opinion Barbara Smith helped coin the term \u201cidentity politics\u201d when she co-authored the Combahee River Collective statement in 1977. She believes that Bernie Sanders is the best hope for helping marginalised Americans in 2020. I am supporting Bernie Sanders for president because I believe that his campaign and his understanding of politics complements the priorities that women of colour defined decades ago. Sport Everton\u2019s turnaround under Carlo Ancelotti means the club is now in the running for a European place. In Italy, a pair of former Manchester United players shone during the Milan derby. Those are two of 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s football action. Austin\u2019s Major League Rugby club has been renamed the Austin Gilgronis, apparently after a yet-to-be-mixed Texan cocktail. It is rare for a professional team to adopt an explicitly corporate moniker, writes Tom Dart \u2013 let alone one that promotes alcohol.

In a reflection of surging house prices and a lost decade for wage growth since the financial crisis, the Office for National Statistics found that a third of 35- to 44-year-olds in England were renting from a private landlord in 2017, compared with fewer than one in 10 in 1997. The government statistics agency said home ownership had become increasingly concentrated among people over the age of 65. Almost three-quarters of adults in the generation that includes baby boomers born after the second world war own their own homes outright, up from just over half in 1993. Against a backdrop of rising generational divisions in modern Britain, the ONS linked Margaret Thatcher\u2019s flagship right-to-buy policy with the boom in home ownership among older Britons, as well as a slump in social housing across the country. Since the launch of the scheme in 1979, which allowed social housing tenants to buy their homes at reduced prices, the proportion of council properties in Britain has slumped from 33.2% to only 17.6% in 2017. The findings from the ONS come with potentially damaging implications for living standards for the current generation of adults under the age of 65, who are poised to enter retirement in worse financial health than their parents. According to research from the insurer Royal London, someone who owns their home outright could expect to maintain their living standards on a pension pot of about \u00a3260,000, while someone who rents privately would need almost double this, at about \u00a3445,000. The ONS said that if the declining home ownership trend continued for the current generation of 35- to 44-year-olds, older people in future would be more likely to live in private rented accommodation than today. Lindsay Judge, the principal research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the government should reform its regulations covering the private rented sector to make sure homes are fit for older people. \u201cThe prospect of renting privately in retirement will alarm many people as it could mean high costs, and low levels of housing security. It also carries huge cost implications for the state as the UK\u2019s housing benefit bill could escalate,\u201d she said. The ONS found early signals to suggest the current trajectory could continue, including figures showing that 15.8% of 45- to 54-year-olds rent from private landlords, up from only 5.6% in 1997. One in three of the millennial generation, born between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, are expected to never own their own home, with many forced to live and raise families in insecure privately rented properties. House prices in some parts of the country have risen out of reach for young adults. According to the ONS, the average full-time worker could expect to pay about 7.8 times their annual earnings on purchasing a home, compared with about 3.5 in the early 1990s. Kensington and Chelsea in London is the most unaffordable place in the country at 44.5 times average annual earnings. Copeland, in the north-west of England, is the most affordable at 2.5 times the average pay. Renting from a private landlord tends to be most common at younger ages but then gradually declines as people take out mortgages or receive an inheritance from family.

In any case, Buttigieg and Sanders have been deprived of the momentum they presumably would have received in an unclouded election, while Biden escaped much of the scrutiny his woeful results otherwise would have incurred. Adding insult to injury, Donald Trump and his minions crowed that the Iowa debacle shows that the Democratic establishment is both incompetent and biased against Sanders\u2019 insurgency. Some of Sanders\u2019 supporters enthusiastically endorsed this <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/iowa-caucus-conspiracy-theories/606055/\">conspiratorial interpretation</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/us/politics/state-of-union-transcript.html\">State of the Union address</a>, the day after the Iowa caucuses, provided an effective showcase for the president to, in effect, preview his re-election campaign. As in his past addresses, he showed flashes of bipartisanship, congratulating members of both parties in Congress for their work on criminal justice reform and imploring them to cooperate on broadly popular issues like public health research funding, infrastructure, paid family leave and reducing prescription drug prices. But Trump <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-snubs-pelosi-state-of-the-union-wont-shake-hand\">conspicuously declined</a> to shake House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s hand when he arrived at the podium, and much of his speech flayed his opponents for their alleged softness toward socialism, criminal aliens, \u201cfailing government schools\u201d and other conservative shibboleths. Trump also was notably ungracious toward the Democratic former president Barack Obama. While he didn\u2019t mention Obama by name, Trump accused him (and to some extent former president George W Bush) of having presided over economic decay, foreign policy weakness and the \u201cdownsizing of Americans\u2019 destiny\u201d.</p> <p>The reception of Trump\u2019s address illustrated the almost complete polarization that prevails in America today. <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/feb/5/sotu-a-story-of-triumph-for-donald-trump-but-not-f/\">Republicans</a> considered the address a thoroughly appropriate \u2013 perfect, one might say \u2013 extended boast about the economic success under his watch. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/05/nancy-pelosi-unleashes-on-trump-after-state-of-the-union-110825\">Democrats</a> considered it a divisive, mean-spirited barrage of lies and slander. (Media sources, for what it\u2019s worth, detected <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/04/fact-checking-president-trumps-2020-state-union-address/\">dozens</a> of exaggerations, misleading statements and outright untruths in the address.) By the same token, your partisan affiliation will probably determine whether you thought Pelosi\u2019s tearing Trump\u2019s speech text apart was an outrageous and disrespectful breach of decorum or a dissent against demagoguery.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s strutting demeanor at the State of the Union address no doubt stemmed in part from his confidence that he would be acquitted in his impeachment trial in the Senate the next day, as indeed proved to be the case. The vote, along <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/us/politics/trump-acquitted-impeachment.html\">almost entirely partisan lines</a>, demonstrated Trump\u2019s overwhelming command over the party he leads. And, as conservative pundits had predicted, the entire impeachment episode has only increased Trump\u2019s popularity. According to the <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/284156/trump-job-approval-personal-best.aspx\">most recent Gallup poll</a>, Trump\u2019s overall approval rating now stands at 49% \u2013 his highest ever and 10 percentage points above his rating in October before the House impeachment proceedings began. His approval rating among Republicans has reached an astonishing 94%, up six percentage points from last month, and his approval rating among independents is also at or near record levels.</p> <p>While election dynamics can change enormously between now and the elections, particularly if more incriminating evidence about the Ukrainian caper leaks out, <a href=\"https://bookies.com/news/us-presidential-election-odds-2020-weekly-rundown-iowa-fallout\">betting markets</a> currently put the odds of Trump\u2019s re-election at well above even. I have no polling expertise, but Democrats clearly ought to be troubled by the depth of the division between their moderate and progressive wings, as well as the likelihood of Sanders and his supporters <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/andrew-yang-bernie-sanders-supporters-wont-support-another-nominee-democratic-unity-msnbc-poll-1485241\">failing to back</a> any other nominee. Worse yet, total turnout in the Iowa caucuses appears to have been at the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/2c418c8bc4ce5775090129c75fbe8b8d\">tepid levels of 2016</a>, as opposed to the record levels of 2008 when Barack Obama\u2019s candidacy galvanized a huge influx of first-time voters. These results would seem to give the lie to predictions that Democrats are highly motivated to turn out to defeat Trump, or that Sanders\u2019 campaign would bring in huge numbers of young people.</p> <p>On a personal note, I will forever remember this week, not because of any political developments but because my father died on Tuesday at age 81 after a long illness. Dad wasn\u2019t particularly interested in politics, but he was a brilliant and meticulous engineer who would have been wholly unsurprised by the Iowa caucuses\u2019 app debacle. He had seen all too many examples of systems whose complexity overwhelmed their users, as well as too many hotshot designers mesmerized by new technology and ignorant of how it would be used in actual practice \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/us/politics/iowa-caucus-shadow-app.html\">in this case</a>, by older, not very tech-savvy caucus chairs who couldn\u2019t figure out how to download or install the app.</p> <p>My dad passed the day before the Utah senator Mitt Romney <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/us/politics/romney-trump-impeachment.html\">cast the only Republican vote</a> to convict Trump for abuse of power, making him the only senator in American history to vote to remove a president from his own party. This sad coincidence made me wonder to what extent Romney\u2019s vote was influenced by the example of his late father, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/george-romney-2012-5/\">George Romney</a>. The elder Romney, who was the moderate Republican governor of Michigan, was one of the most formidable figures in American political life in the 1960s. I consider him one of history\u2019s great might-have-beens. If he had defeated Richard Nixon for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968, amid the turmoil of the civil rights era and the Vietnam war, in all likelihood the GOP would have been the anti-war party and there would have been no \u201csouthern strategy\u201d appealing to anti-integration white southerners.</p> <p>Mitt Romney <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/george-and-mitt-romney-like-father-like-son-until-a-political-parting-point/2011/11/18/gIQAOlD62N_story.html\">told</a> the Washington Post reporter Michael Leahy in 2011 that \u201cmy dad was a champion of civil rights when some in the Republican party questioned the civil rights movement\u201d \u2013 and, he might have added, when the Romneys\u2019 Mormon church still prohibited African Americans from admission to the priesthood. George Romney\u2019s courageous adherence to principle was a large part of why his son called him \u201cmy greatest influence\u201d and \u201cthe person I have admired most in political life\u201d.</p> <p>Before he cast his vote for Trump\u2019s conviction, Mitt Romney acknowledged that he would face vehement denunciation from many Republicans, and unsurprisingly a tidal wave of abuse and ostracism has come his way from Trump\u2019s supporters. Donald Trump Jr has called to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/481680-trump-jr-says-romney-should-be-expelled-from-the-gop\">expel</a> Romney from the party he led as the Republican presidential nominee in 2012. Romney\u2019s speech announcing his vote <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/05/mitt-romney-trump-impeachment-speech/\">moved some </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/05/mitt-romney-trump-impeachment-speech/\">senators to tears</a>, so rare is it to see a Washington politician acting on principle against all calculations of politics and self-interest. Romney said that his fidelity to God and the constitution \u2013 which his father believed was a divinely inspired document \u2013 apparently left him no other choice. But the wish to live up to our parents\u2019 example can also inspire us to be the best version of ourselves. May Americans of all political persuasions (and none) keep this in mind as we head into this agonizingly divisive election season.</p>",

Trump also was notably ungracious toward the Democratic former president Barack Obama. While he didn\u2019t mention Obama by name, Trump accused him (and to some extent former president George W Bush) of having presided over economic decay, foreign policy weakness and the \u201cdownsizing of Americans\u2019 destiny\u201d. The reception of Trump\u2019s address illustrated the almost complete polarization that prevails in America today. Republicans considered the address a thoroughly appropriate \u2013 perfect, one might say \u2013 extended boast about the economic success under his watch. Democrats considered it a divisive, mean-spirited barrage of lies and slander. (Media sources, for what it\u2019s worth, detected dozens of exaggerations, misleading statements and outright untruths in the address.) By the same token, your partisan affiliation will probably determine whether you thought Pelosi\u2019s tearing Trump\u2019s speech text apart was an outrageous and disrespectful breach of decorum or a dissent against demagoguery. Trump\u2019s strutting demeanor at the State of the Union address no doubt stemmed in part from his confidence that he would be acquitted in his impeachment trial in the Senate the next day, as indeed proved to be the case. The vote, along almost entirely partisan lines, demonstrated Trump\u2019s overwhelming command over the party he leads. And, as conservative pundits had predicted, the entire impeachment episode has only increased Trump\u2019s popularity. According to the most recent Gallup poll, Trump\u2019s overall approval rating now stands at 49% \u2013 his highest ever and 10 percentage points above his rating in October before the House impeachment proceedings began. His approval rating among Republicans has reached an astonishing 94%, up six percentage points from last month, and his approval rating among independents is also at or near record levels. While election dynamics can change enormously between now and the elections, particularly if more incriminating evidence about the Ukrainian caper leaks out, betting markets currently put the odds of Trump\u2019s re-election at well above even. I have no polling expertise, but Democrats clearly ought to be troubled by the depth of the division between their moderate and progressive wings, as well as the likelihood of Sanders and his supporters failing to back any other nominee. Worse yet, total turnout in the Iowa caucuses appears to have been at the tepid levels of 2016, as opposed to the record levels of 2008 when Barack Obama\u2019s candidacy galvanized a huge influx of first-time voters. These results would seem to give the lie to predictions that Democrats are highly motivated to turn out to defeat Trump, or that Sanders\u2019 campaign would bring in huge numbers of young people. On a personal note, I will forever remember this week, not because of any political developments but because my father died on Tuesday at age 81 after a long illness. Dad wasn\u2019t particularly interested in politics, but he was a brilliant and meticulous engineer who would have been wholly unsurprised by the Iowa caucuses\u2019 app debacle. He had seen all too many examples of systems whose complexity overwhelmed their users, as well as too many hotshot designers mesmerized by new technology and ignorant of how it would be used in actual practice \u2013 in this case, by older, not very tech-savvy caucus chairs who couldn\u2019t figure out how to download or install the app. My dad passed the day before the Utah senator Mitt Romney cast the only Republican vote to convict Trump for abuse of power, making him the only senator in American history to vote to remove a president from his own party. This sad coincidence made me wonder to what extent Romney\u2019s vote was influenced by the example of his late father, George Romney. The elder Romney, who was the moderate Republican governor of Michigan, was one of the most formidable figures in American political life in the 1960s. I consider him one of history\u2019s great might-have-beens. If he had defeated Richard Nixon for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968, amid the turmoil of the civil rights era and the Vietnam war, in all likelihood the GOP would have been the anti-war party and there would have been no \u201csouthern strategy\u201d appealing to anti-integration white southerners. Mitt Romney told the Washington Post reporter Michael Leahy in 2011 that \u201cmy dad was a champion of civil rights when some in the Republican party questioned the civil rights movement\u201d \u2013 and, he might have added, when the Romneys\u2019 Mormon church still prohibited African Americans from admission to the priesthood. George Romney\u2019s courageous adherence to principle was a large part of why his son called him \u201cmy greatest influence\u201d and \u201cthe person I have admired most in political life\u201d. Before he cast his vote for Trump\u2019s conviction, Mitt Romney acknowledged that he would face vehement denunciation from many Republicans, and unsurprisingly a tidal wave of abuse and ostracism has come his way from Trump\u2019s supporters. Donald Trump Jr has called to expel Romney from the party he led as the Republican presidential nominee in 2012. Romney\u2019s speech announcing his vote moved some senators to tears, so rare is it to see a Washington politician acting on principle against all calculations of politics and self-interest. Romney said that his fidelity to God and the constitution \u2013 which his father believed was a divinely inspired document \u2013 apparently left him no other choice. But the wish to live up to our parents\u2019 example can also inspire us to be the best version of ourselves. May Americans of all political persuasions (and none) keep this in mind as we head into this agonizingly divisive election season.",

However, this unfortunate association does not make them ugly to me. Quite the opposite: I find the tray of rough-hewn mounds delightful, like a soft almond amaretti, only made more interesting with the dense butteriness of hazelnuts and an almost toffee chew.</p> <p>Brutti ma buoni are made of just three ingredients: hazelnuts, sugar and egg whites, the proportion of each depending on the recipe. Having tried half a dozen, I found one I am happy with, not least because it is a recipe with two possible outcomes. Both, though, start with ground hazelnuts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/17/soft-almond-biscuits-with-cherries-recipe-rachel-roddy\">Rachel Roddy\u2019s Sicilian soft almond biscuits \u2013 recipe | A Kitchen in Rome</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You can buy ground hazelnuts, but the natural oils start dissipating as soon as they are ground, so the flavour fades in the bag. If you have time, it is worth buying whole, unblanched ones and roasting them, which brings out the flavour, then grinding them yourself. While some recipes claim that true brutti ma buoni must have a double cooking, others don\u2019t. For the latter, let the soft mixture sit for five minutes, then plop teaspoons of it on to a baking tray lined with parchment. Bake at 130C (110C fan)/gas \u00bd for 45 minutes. This makes 20 or so pale, meringue-like brutti ma buoni that have a brittle shell and a slightly chewy middle.</p> <p>The second option is to scrape the mixture into a pan and cook it again over a medium flame for five to seven minutes, stirring continuously. It will thicken like porridge and darken. Let it sit for five minutes, so it can tighten even more, then use a spoon to arrange the mixture in small, walnut-sized mounds on a baking tray lined with parchment. As before, bake at 130C (110C fan)/gas \u00bd for 45 minutes; the double cooking changes the nature of the dough and produces a dark, craggy outside \u2013 not so much crisp but firm \u2013 and a chewy, almost toffee-like middle.</p> <p>My preference is for the second option: the rough hewn version that justifies the second step. That said, if I was going to make them to go with a soft pudding, such as chocolate mousse, syllabub or lemon pudding, then the first option, the pale and delicate meringue brutti ma buoni with their gentle crumble, make for a beautiful partner.</p> <h2>Brutti ma buoni (\u201cugly but good\u201d hazelnut biscuits)</h2> <p>Prep <strong>10 min<br></strong>Cook <strong>1 hr 30 min<br></strong>Makes <strong>20-25</strong></p> <p><strong>200g hazelnuts<br>110g icing sugar<br>80g egg white</strong> (the whites of two medium-sized eggs)<br><strong>1 pinch salt<br>40g caster sugar</strong></p> <p>Put the hazelnuts on a baking tray then into an oven set to 170C (150C fan)/gas 3 for 10-15 minutes, or until lightly coloured and the skins blistered.

Brutti ma buoni are made of just three ingredients: hazelnuts, sugar and egg whites, the proportion of each depending on the recipe. Having tried half a dozen, I found one I am happy with, not least because it is a recipe with two possible outcomes. Both, though, start with ground hazelnuts. You can buy ground hazelnuts, but the natural oils start dissipating as soon as they are ground, so the flavour fades in the bag. If you have time, it is worth buying whole, unblanched ones and roasting them, which brings out the flavour, then grinding them yourself. While some recipes claim that true brutti ma buoni must have a double cooking, others don\u2019t. For the latter, let the soft mixture sit for five minutes, then plop teaspoons of it on to a baking tray lined with parchment. Bake at 130C (110C fan)/gas \u00bd for 45 minutes. This makes 20 or so pale, meringue-like brutti ma buoni that have a brittle shell and a slightly chewy middle. The second option is to scrape the mixture into a pan and cook it again over a medium flame for five to seven minutes, stirring continuously. It will thicken like porridge and darken. Let it sit for five minutes, so it can tighten even more, then use a spoon to arrange the mixture in small, walnut-sized mounds on a baking tray lined with parchment. As before, bake at 130C (110C fan)/gas \u00bd for 45 minutes; the double cooking changes the nature of the dough and produces a dark, craggy outside \u2013 not so much crisp but firm \u2013 and a chewy, almost toffee-like middle. My preference is for the second option: the rough hewn version that justifies the second step. That said, if I was going to make them to go with a soft pudding, such as chocolate mousse, syllabub or lemon pudding, then the first option, the pale and delicate meringue brutti ma buoni with their gentle crumble, make for a beautiful partner. Brutti ma buoni (\u201cugly but good\u201d hazelnut biscuits) Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr 30 min Makes 20-25 200g hazelnuts 110g icing sugar 80g egg white (the whites of two medium-sized eggs) 1 pinch salt 40g caster sugar Put the hazelnuts on a baking tray then into an oven set to 170C (150C fan)/gas 3 for 10-15 minutes, or until lightly coloured and the skins blistered. Wrap the nuts in a kitchen towel, leave for one minute then, making sure the towel is wrapped tightly, rub vigorously to remove the loose skins \u2013 don\u2019t worry about skins that don\u2019t come off. Leave to cool. Grind or pound the nuts into a coarse rubble, set a third aside, then continue grinding the rest into a fine flour. Put the coarse and finely ground nuts into a bowl with the icing sugar. Whisk the egg whites and a pinch of salt until frothy, add the caster sugar and whisk until stiff, sleek peaks form. Fold the egg whites into the nuts and sugar. There are two options for baking. The first is to let the mixture rest for five minutes, then plop teaspoons of it onto a baking tray lined with parchment, leaving space between each one as they will spread. Bake at 130C (110C fan)/gas \u00bd for 45 minutes, then leave to cool before lifting from the tin. The second option is to scrape the mixture into a pan and cook over a medium flame, stirring continuously, for five to seven minutes, in which time the mixture will thicken and darken from beige to a deep golden brown. Leave to rest for five minutes. Plop teaspoons of the mixture onto a baking tray lined with parchment. Bake at 130C (110C fan)/gas \u00bd for 45 minutes. Allow to cool before lifting from the tin.",

I wouldn\u2019t label Gizzi a formalist, unless we include formal innovation in that term. His syntax, for example, often evokes the motion of thought-in-action instead of following grammatical convention.

The small distinction adds an interesting flicker around the metaphors, which accumulate towards the end of the stanza and, again, centre on words that hoard semantic possibilities \u2013 \u201cpulp\u201d and \u201ccardinal\u201d. There\u2019s still the question of the subject of the second sentence: is it the singer or the song? And what about the identity of the \u201ccardinal feeling\u201d \u2013 could it be love?</p> <p>The connected chain of infinitives in line three made me think the poem was about its own writing, a different matter from a poem about writing poetry. And although it\u2019s best to resist the temptation of \u201cabout\u201d in responding to any good poem, it amused me to think that those \u201csongbirds\u201d in the second stanza might primarily be other poets \u2013 flyaway, obscure, exasperating.</p> <p>It emerges that the singer of this poem has a specific, or at least earthly location.

But the moon is shining.</p> <p>We may catch a glimpse of William Blake\u2019s <a href=\"https://voxpopulisphere.com/2016/09/26/william-blake-the-tyger/\">Tyger</a> and \u201cforests of the night\u201d as a result of the chained infinitives in the third stanza: \u201cto blaze / to Blake\u201d. I admired the mixing of abstract nouns and visual images in \u201cthe moon\u2019s / aphorism and / its garden of figures\u201d. We should notice, though, the slight resistance of the statement \u201cI am willing\u201d, in contrast to the first stanza\u2019s \u201cI want\u201d. It\u2019s another facet of the ambivalence: irony and distance nudging at romantic affirmation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1967/03/09/petrarch-restored/\">Petrarchan fire and ice</a> cohabit in Song\u2019s magic melting pot. But the moon (or, rather, \u201cthe moon above / my life\u201d) is \u201crough and real\u201d \u2013 and allowed to be both public property and a treasured personal symbol. The vision of its rays prompts a kaleidoscopic tease of images. (Note: dinghy is not only a small boat \u2013 perhaps originally from the Sanskrit, it once meant an object made of wood. The Kobold is an earth-elemental or nature spirit from German folklore. As the speaker says, \u201cThere is a quaver, / a gibbous light / to this equation.\u201d)</p> <p>Song has a sonnet-like \u201cturn\u201d near the end. It introduces a direct address (\u201cyour face\u201d) and, in its final line, a surprising endearment that\u2019s nearly a declaration of the \u201ccardinal feeling\u201d, perhaps: \u201cThe strangeness / becomes you, / darling night.\u201d</p> <p>The recipient, though a source of poetic inspiration, need not represent a person: it may simply be the night. But the proximity of the moon and the reference to \u201cstrangeness\u201d that \u201cbecomes you\u201d may be meant to remind us of the lines of a popular <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_to_...]\">Road to \u2026</a> movie love song: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/1946956/Bing+Crosby/Moonlight+Becomes+You\">Moonlight becomes you, it goes with your hair / you certainly know the right things to wear</a>.\u201d The light-hearted echo enhances the poem, adds another ray of sweet puzzle to its remarkable fusion of sound and vision, realism and fanciful flight.<br></p>",

We may catch a glimpse of William Blake\u2019s Tyger and \u201cforests of the night\u201d as a result of the chained infinitives in the third stanza: \u201cto blaze / to Blake\u201d. I admired the mixing of abstract nouns and visual images in \u201cthe moon\u2019s / aphorism and / its garden of figures\u201d. We should notice, though, the slight resistance of the statement \u201cI am willing\u201d, in contrast to the first stanza\u2019s \u201cI want\u201d. It\u2019s another facet of the ambivalence: irony and distance nudging at romantic affirmation. Petrarchan fire and ice cohabit in Song\u2019s magic melting pot. But the moon (or, rather, \u201cthe moon above / my life\u201d) is \u201crough and real\u201d \u2013 and allowed to be both public property and a treasured personal symbol. The vision of its rays prompts a kaleidoscopic tease of images. (Note: dinghy is not only a small boat \u2013 perhaps originally from the Sanskrit, it once meant an object made of wood. The Kobold is an earth-elemental or nature spirit from German folklore. As the speaker says, \u201cThere is a quaver, / a gibbous light / to this equation.\u201d) Song has a sonnet-like \u201cturn\u201d near the end. It introduces a direct address (\u201cyour face\u201d) and, in its final line, a surprising endearment that\u2019s nearly a declaration of the \u201ccardinal feeling\u201d, perhaps: \u201cThe strangeness / becomes you, / darling night.\u201d The recipient, though a source of poetic inspiration, need not represent a person: it may simply be the night. But the proximity of the moon and the reference to \u201cstrangeness\u201d that \u201cbecomes you\u201d may be meant to remind us of the lines of a popular Road to \u2026 movie love song: \u201cMoonlight becomes you, it goes with your hair / you certainly know the right things to wear.\u201d The light-hearted echo enhances the poem, adds another ray of sweet puzzle to its remarkable fusion of sound and vision, realism and fanciful flight.",

      "bodyText": "After an awards season marked by its predictability, the Oscars delivered a spectacular final-reel twist on Sunday evening, naming capitalist satire Parasite best picture. Bong Joon-ho\u2019s comedy-drama about an impoverished family who infiltrate the household of a wealthier one is the first film not in the English language to take the top prize. It also took best director, best original screenplay and best international film. Sam Mendes\u2019s 1917 had been tipped to rule triumphant at this year\u2019s Academy Awards, following its key victories at the Baftas, Golden Globes and crucial bellwethers such as the Producers Guild Awards. In the event, the harrowing first world war drama took three awards: for Roger Deakins\u2019 cinematography and for its visual effects and sound mixing. Bong\u2019s film also defeated Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Jojo Rabbit and The Irishman to best picture. It marks the first time in 65 years \u2013 since Marty in 1955 \u2013 that the winner of the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes has progressed to a best picture Oscar. Bong paid tribute to Scorsese in his best director speech, saying that, when he was young, he \u201ccarved deep into my heart\u201d a quote by Scorsese: \u201cThe most personal is the most creative.\u201d He also thanked Tarantino for championing his work: \u201cQuentin, I love you.\u201d When the film won best picture, Bong gave the microphone to the film\u2019s producers Kwak Sin-ae and Miky Lee. Kwak said she felt \u201ca very opportune moment in history is happening right now\u201d, and Lee paid tribute to Bong, praising his \u201ccrazy hair, the way he talks, the way he walks \u2026 and especially the way he directs\u201d. She then thanked the Korean cinemagoing public for \u201cnever hesitating to give us straightforward opinions that made us never about to be complacent, and to keep pushing the envelope.\u201d Only 10 foreign-language films have previously been nominated for best picture \u2013 including Amour and Life Is Beautiful \u2013 but none of them won. Last year, many thought Alfonso Cuaron\u2019s autobiographical drama Roma might take best picture as well as director, but it was pipped to the post by Green Book. That result was not well received, with many people feeling the Academy\u2019s strenuous attempts to diversify were undermined by the celebration of a film whose approach to race relations seems more suited to its 60s setting than to 2019. Such fallout \u2013 coupled with the backlash to the fact only one person of colour (Harriet\u2019s Cynthia Erivo) was nominated for an acting award \u2013 could help explain Parasite\u2019s unprecedented win. Voters are eager to prove their inclusivity, and that they don\u2019t fear what Bong called at the Golden Globes \u201cthe one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles\u201d. Almost every person who took to the stage during the ceremony alluded to this year\u2019s dominant controversy, with Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s opening musical medley seeking to highlight ethnically diverse films, and rapper Utkarsh Ambudkar giving an earnest midway recap of the evening\u2019s inclusivity credentials. Opening presenter Chris Rock made blunt reference to what was missing from this year\u2019s director nominees: \u201cvaginas\u201d. Lead actor Joaquin Phoenix followed a string of politically charged acceptance speeches \u2013 including his attack on the \u201csystemic racism\u201d of the film industry at last Sunday\u2019s Baftas \u2013 with an impassioned call to arms, imploring people to stop fighting and to stop exploiting one another, the planet and the other species living on it. \u201cI think we\u2019ve become very disconnected from the natural world,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of us are guilty of an egocentric worldview, and we believe that we\u2019re the centre of the universe. We go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakeable. Then we take her milk that\u2019s intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal.\u201d He closed his emotional address by quoting a lyric written aged 17 by his late brother, River: \u201cRun to the rescue with love and peace will follow.\u201d Phoenix was a much-anticipated victor in the best actor category, for his role as a mentally ill aspirant comedian in Joker; likewise Ren\u00e9e Zellweger being named best actress for her performance in the Judy Garland biopic raised few eyebrows. The supporting actor races also unfolded as expected, with Brad Pitt and Laura Dern winning for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Marriage Story, respectively. Both thanked their parents and their children, with Pitt straying into politics to mention that his 45-second speech was 45 seconds more than the time afforded to John Bolton by the senate in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. Elsewhere, Taika Waititi proved a popular presence both on stage \u2013 where he dedicated his trophy for best adapted screenplay for Jojo Rabbit to \u201call the Indigenous kids all over the world\u201d \u2013 and backstage. It was there he offered a commentary on contemporary far-right extremism, saying that, at the end of the second world war: \u201cif you were at Nazi, you would go to jail. Now you\u2019re a Nazi, feel free to have a rally down in the square with your mates.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 10 February 2020 to correct the names of the producers of Parasite, Kwak Sin-ae and Miky Lee, who were misidentified as actors in the film; and to remove an error about former national security advisor John Bolton, who was incorrectly described as a senator.",

It sets up quite an enticing final fixture on Thursday night between the two, who will both be fighting tooth and nail to finish top and, we assume, avoid South Korea.</p> <p>This was a funny game. Zero goals for 43 minutes. Then two goals in four minutes just before halftime, and another four in six midway through the second half. It sort of epitomises the fact we saw both sides of the Matildas tonight, and those second-half subs to bring on Kerr and Raso helped matters markedly.</p> <p>If I\u2019m going to dish out constructive criticism, which is my job, then Australia probably should have scored a few more based on their utter dominance of all key statistics. Some final-third decision-making was sorely lacking at times and there are still a few defensive questions there that may not get answered until the Matildas face higher-quality opposition. But overall a very happy night in Campbelltown.

It\u2019s a team that less than two years ago, took our side to a penalty shoot-out, that we drew with after 120 minutes.

That spot is up for grabs at the moment and there\u2019s a lot of rotation through there. So it\u2019s really important that Jenna and Alanna work together and talk a lot to make sure that combination really starts to set in.

And what a pleasure it is to return to the scene of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArsenalWFC/status/1225798118559666176\">Caitlin Foord\u2019s</a> hat-trick, Kyah Simon\u2019s international resurrection, and the belated realisation that Sam Kerr is not the be all and end all of this national team. Behold Ante Milicic\u2019s glorious goal-scoring breadth in Foord, Steph Catley, Hayley Raso, Katrina Gorry and, well, okay, Kerr did add one off the bench within three minutes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/matildas-step-out-of-sam-kerrs-shadow-and-thrive-with-spotlight-on-them\">Friday night\u2019s almost casual 7-0 job on Taiwan</a>. </p> <p>And thus, Australia are obvious favourites against Thailand, who have lost their first two games and conceded seven goals in the process. Win this one and they\u2019ll seal a top-two finish in qualifying Group B, ensuring a home-and-away play-off next month from Group A for a ticket to Tokyod. Beat China on Thursday night at Bankwest Stadium and they will clinch top spot and avoid a likely match-up with a tough South Korea outfit. China will be the first real test, given they dealt with Thailand 6-1 on Friday and brushed aside Taiwan 5-0 in tonight\u2019s first fixture.</p> <p>In solid proof that much can happen over three days in football, Milicic has made six changes to his starting XI and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/10/sydneys-warragamba-dam-levels-surge-to-62-capacity-after-torrential-rain\">nine months\u2019 worth of water has poured into Sydney\u2019s catchments</a>, putting Campbelltown\u2019s drainage system under more pressure than anyone in Emily van Egmond\u2019s way on Friday night.</p> <p>\u201cTo be fair, the ground at Campbelltown was really good considering the conditions,\u201d said the midfielder and provider of three assists against Taiwan. \u201cI think the rain the other night on the field was probably a good thing. I think it actually made the speed of the game a little bit quicker. It was just like wetting the pitch before any normal game. We have definitely played in worse conditions than what we experienced the other night.\u201d</p> <p>In terms of team changes, Ellie Carpenter, Aivi Luik, Alanna Kennedy (captain), Emily Gielnik, Mackenzie Arnold and Katrina Gorry are all in. They take the place of Clare Polkinghorne, Catley, Chloe Logarzo, Elise Kellond-Knight, Lydia Williams and Raso.</p> <p>As ever, get in touch with any thoughts via <a href=\"mailto:emma.kemp.casual@theguardian.com\">Email</a> or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emmavkemp\">@emmavkemp</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheMatildas/status/1226767632176533504\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">STARTING XI | Here&#39;s how we line up tonight against Thailand! <br><br>\u23f0 Kick-off is 7:30pm AEDT.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/THAvAUS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#THAvAUS</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeAreMatildas?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WeAreMatildas</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/nfqmXuAABo\">pic.twitter.com/nfqmXuAABo</a></p>&mdash; Westfield Matildas (@TheMatildas) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheMatildas/status/1226767632176533504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 10, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s more than enough goals to send the Matildas back to the top of the group, ahead of China on goal difference. It sets up quite an enticing final fixture on Thursday night between the two, who will both be fighting tooth and nail to finish top and, we assume, avoid South Korea. This was a funny game. Zero goals for 43 minutes. Then two goals in four minutes just before halftime, and another four in six midway through the second half. It sort of epitomises the fact we saw both sides of the Matildas tonight, and those second-half subs to bring on Kerr and Raso helped matters markedly. If I\u2019m going to dish out constructive criticism, which is my job, then Australia probably should have scored a few more based on their utter dominance of all key statistics. Some final-third decision-making was sorely lacking at times and there are still a few defensive questions there that may not get answered until the Matildas face higher-quality opposition. But overall a very happy night in Campbelltown. Thanks for joining me and look out for Sam Lewis\u2019s analysis on these pages early tomorrow morning. 94 min: The very last play is very nearly a seventh goal for Australia as Carpenter directs a cross towards Kerr\u2019s head. It\u2019s a dangerous head for any goalkeeper contemplating its next move. But, somehow, Tiffany does, getting a glove to the top-corner effort with a brilliant leaping save. Full time. 93 min: Thailand 0-6 Australia: Silawan Intamee winds up for a long-range effort. And it looks worryingly on target for Mackenzie Arnold, before failing to dip quite enough and landing on the roof netting. That would have been some consolation. 91 min Thailand 0-6 Australia: Dear oh dear. Foord has offended the woodwork in some way tonight, because it has recuffed her yet again. Brenton Speed has coined it \u201ca hat-trick of posters\u201d. I\u2019ll just leave that there. 90 min Thailand 0-6 Australia: Thailand are tiring, their initially compact, organised shape dispersing into singular navy specks. Good things Tiffany is still alert to the danger as Raso flicks in a cross-cum-shot. 87 min Thailand 0-6 Australia: Van Egmond takes another set piece that is not as successful or beautiful as her last, and a scramble ensues before the balls pops out in Thailand\u2019s possession. Kanjana is by far Thailand\u2019s most threatening player in attack. She\u2019s a quick one. Blink and you\u2019ll miss her. 82 min Thailand 0-6 Australia: Oooh, a card! The first of the evening. It\u2019s Ainon Phancha who goes into the book for a challenge on Raso, who has a habit of running at players. 76 min Thailand 0-6 Australia: Foord, conversely, couldn\u2019t stop scoring on Friday but just can\u2019t seem to start on return to the scene of her heroics. She\u2019s denied by the woodwork again. Meanwhile, Thailand have their first corner of the night but the Australian defence does not allow it to progress any further. 74 min Thailand 0-6 Australia: Simon\u2019s job is, quite literally, done as she\u2019s subbed off for Tameka Yallop. And I, quite literally, cannot type quickly enough to keep up with these goals. Could\u2019ve spread them out over the 90 minutes, hey girls. Genuinely, though, this is fluid football and more like what we witnessed against Taiwan on Friday night. Milicic will be happy with this. 73 min Thailand 0-6 Australia: That\u2019s three goals in four minutes for the Matildas, not to mention two assists from Kerr in 10 minutes. What a difference those substitutions have made. But the goal belongs to Simon. Van Egmond takes an excellent free-kick and Simon rises highest of all the congregated bodies to re-divert a header to her left with enough momentum to see it sail past Tiffany. That\u2019s a brace, and this is the Kyah Simon of old, the one who sent the Matildas through to the 2015 World Cup quarter-finals. 71 min Thailand 0-5 Australia: Raso makes it five one minute later and finish is a belter - maybe her best in a green and gold shirt yet. Navy blue bodies trail in Kerr\u2019s wake and she picks out the new Everton signing for her second goal in as many games. 70 min Thailand 0-4 Australia: Simon drifts forward on the right and plays in for Kerr at the far post. The Chelsea star\u2019s first touch is lovely as she cuts back for van Egmond, and the City playmaker has her hat-trick. That No 10 role is suiting her to a tee. 67 min Thailand 0-3 Australia: Roestbakken, who has switched to left-back from her right-back role against Taiwan, overlaps Kerr down the left and crosses into the goalmouth where an unmarked Kyah Simon is ready - she\u2019s been ready for some time now for a 25th international goal - and finishes with some unknown part of her abdomen/shoulder/hip but finishes all the same. And that moment of pure, joyful untidiness put Simon equal seventh on the Matildas\u2019 all-time scoring chart. 64 min Thailand 0-2 Australia: ARGY-BARGY! Foord is given a little shove from behind by Nutwadee Pram-nak as she dribbles to the byline. 63 min Thailand 0-2 Australia: EVE wants a hat-trick and doesn\u2019t do things by halves. Her right boot up by her hip as she takes a swing on the volley that smacks into the crossbar. Had that tucked inside that would have been a peach! The rebound falls to Foord but she cannot convert. 61 min Thailand 0-2 Australia: DOUBLE SUBSTITUTION! As suspected, Kerr has her toes on the touchline and Raso is standing beside her to replace Gorry and Gielnik, the latter of whom was visibly tiring. 58 min Thailand 0-2 Australia: Gielnik is offside receiving a through ball from Gorry but she\u2019s on in the next phase of play which amounts to little. Tell you what, Natthakarn, who denied Foord just before, has been a weapon for Thailand. She looks understandably tired. 55 min Thailand 0-2 Australia: Here\u2019s a stat: Thailand have completed 77 passes to Australia\u2019s 342. One of those is Simon\u2019s inswinger with which Foord fails to connect. Maybe a composure. That said, I\u2019m still rating her playing up top. Here\u2019s van Egmond\u2019s second goal ICYMI! 51 min Thailand 0-2 Australia: Six minutes into the second half and the Matildas are already four chances deep, one from Foord, an audacious air swing from McCormick and a shot from Gorry among the action. Tiffany is standing up firmly under the pressure, with four saves from her six shots faced. 48 min Thailand 0-2 Australia: We\u2019re back under way and no halftime changes from Milicic, though Kerr appears to be warming up. And it\u2019s a more positive start for the Matildas as McCormick gets a head to a ball and forces Tiffany into action. HT: That opening 45 minutes was a difficult one to watch in many ways. Too often disjointed and awkward and sometimes susceptible at the back, in a way perhaps reflecting the mass changes. Cue van Egmond\u2019s two goals in four minutes. It was fitting reward for two-time assister Carpenter, who has been fleet-footed all night. 45+4 min Thailand 0-2 Australia: The referee allows first-half stoppage-time to continue well after the allotted and it turns out to be a blessing for hosts, as van Egmond stands unmarked at the top of the area for a pass before whipping forward to feed the ball out wide to Carpenter and continuing her run for a first-time finish. Last Friday\u2019s assist queen has a brace. And it arrived via more link-up play from her City teammate Carpenter. It came after Foord was denied by the woodwork following a mazy run. 45 min: And it\u2019s not goalless anymore. A nice Carpenter ball into the box but van Egmond\u2019s volleyed side-footed finish is delicate and instinctive for her 19th international goal. 43 min: Geez, Gielnik can\u2019t buy a goal. This time she has a cross at her fight and winds up from the top of the box but can\u2019t bring it down inside the crossbar. Frustration is creeping into the Matildas\u2019 game now. With 12 shots and 15 crosses to Thailand\u2019s none, this contest really should not be goalless. 41 min: Kennedy\u2019s international pedigree is shining through here as Thailand fly up the field on the counter and Kanjana Sung-Ngoen very nearly outsmarts her marker only for Kennedy to get the last laugh with a timely one-footed intervention. 38 min: Gielnik has cut inside, in a clear demonstration she can follow sideline instructions, but skews her finish marginally wide. 34 min: Thailand embark on a rare foray forward and an error instigates the counter-attack the Matildas might need. Foord is in possession and Carpenter overlapping but is interrupted before she can receive by a brave Tiffany. Thailand\u2019s goalkeeper has been brilliant so far, and the Matildas far from it. This is getting a bit Asian Cup-esque. Now poor Natthakarn has sandwiched the back post making a clearance and is receiving more medical treatment. 31 min: In similar vein, bodies are flying in all directions in a goal-mouth scramble. A ball off Kennedy\u2019s back ricochets off two Thais before Foord launches herself in its general direction. Still, we have no goal. 28 min: Head clash! Kennedy and Natthakarn Chinwong collide in the air as they contest a corner and it\u2019s the latter who comes off second best. Kennedy manages not to go down but is clutching her head nonetheless and both receive medical attention before play continues. 26 min: Gielnik is through in space via a Gorry through ball and she utilises her physicality to skirt inside a defender but is confronted by several other navy shirts before she\u2019s even looked up at goal. 23 min: Carpenter was a standout at the World Cup and the 19-year-old is in vintage form again, whipping in another cross that Foord is ill-equipped to deal with. An opener could be around the corner but Thailand and their goalkeeper are holding firm for now. 20 min: McCormick finds Foord but she fluffs her first touch. Milicic is on the sideline and the broadcast mics pick up a \u201cHey Gielnik come inside after, not yet\u201d as a high ball flies into the box, though Simon can\u2019t time her strike. Now Carpenter delivers on a plate to van Egmond, who inexplicably sprays a volley wide. That was Australia\u2019s best chance yet. 14 min: The Matildas are sitting on a cool 77 per cent possession but Thailand seem quite chilled off the ball as it stands, happy to sit back and wait for errors. And Australia will want to watch some of their passes because they aren\u2019t all finding their desired destinations. 12 min: Van Egmond may have opened the scoring but for the offside flag, which is raised following a through ball from Roestbakken. 10 min: Gielnik wins the ball but the Bayern Munich forward leaves it for Gorry, who was heading in the wrong direction. Carpenter races in now for a lovely touch as Pikul Khueanpet slides in for a luckless tackle attempt while Foord but Tiffany Sornpao claims easily. 8 min: Australia have two successive corners. The first is taken short by van Egmond and Kennedy backheels to Simon inside the box but it\u2019s a bit too much of a stretch. The second amounts to nothing. Melbourne City pair Carpenter and Simon are flying forward now, the former feeding to the latter for an underlapping one-two, but the cross is poor. 5 min: And we\u2019re under way at Campbelltown Stadium. Thailand have set up in compact fashion, in an attempt to shut down Australia\u2019s attacking raids. Patience will be key in this game. And Kyah Simon has broken down the right but is unable to find van Egmond. So after China\u2019s 5-0 win over Taiwan this afternoon and some (rudimentary) mathematics the latest equation is this: the Matildas can return to the top the group with a win by four goals. Vietnam are looking like a prospective play-off opponent should they finish top come Thursday night. For all Thailand\u2019s weaknesses, let\u2019s not forget this is the team that took the Matildas to penalties in the 2018 Asian Cup. That performance was well, well below their best and required an injury-time equaliser and then some Arnold goalkeeping heroics to book a place in the final. Milicic isn\u2019t one to forget such things. \u201cIt\u2019s easy now to say that they\u2019ve lost two - how are they going to approach it?\u201d he said in Friday\u2019s post-match press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s a team that\u2019s played at the World Cup. It\u2019s a team that less than two years ago, took our side to a penalty shoot-out, that we drew with after 120 minutes. So we won\u2019t be complacent against that kind of opposition.\u201d Kennedy\u2019s reinsertion at centre-back alongside McCormick is an interesting one. This is the first time the pair have played together, and shows Milicic\u2019s eagerness to use the less-challenging ties for experimentation. Former Matildas defender Amy Duggan is on the Fox Sports pre-game show and is talking about the importance of the \u201cunspoken language\u201d between central defensive partners. \u201cLarns is a great player,\u201d Duggan says. \u201cBut finding her a partner ... her and Laura Brock used to have a wonderful combination. That spot is up for grabs at the moment and there\u2019s a lot of rotation through there. So it\u2019s really important that Jenna and Alanna work together and talk a lot to make sure that combination really starts to set in. I think he\u2019s playing Jenna and Karly because they\u2019re two players only recently capped and only have a handful of games playing for Australia.\u201d Luik for me is an excellent inclusion in midfield. A calm, composed presence who has obviously impressed Milicic given her continued selection, including for last year\u2019s World Cup. Hello, and welcome to live coverage of the Matildas\u2019 second Olympic qualifying clash. And what a pleasure it is to return to the scene of Caitlin Foord\u2019s hat-trick, Kyah Simon\u2019s international resurrection, and the belated realisation that Sam Kerr is not the be all and end all of this national team. Behold Ante Milicic\u2019s glorious goal-scoring breadth in Foord, Steph Catley, Hayley Raso, Katrina Gorry and, well, okay, Kerr did add one off the bench within three minutes in Friday night\u2019s almost casual 7-0 job on Taiwan. And thus, Australia are obvious favourites against Thailand, who have lost their first two games and conceded seven goals in the process. Win this one and they\u2019ll seal a top-two finish in qualifying Group B, ensuring a home-and-away play-off next month from Group A for a ticket to Tokyod. Beat China on Thursday night at Bankwest Stadium and they will clinch top spot and avoid a likely match-up with a tough South Korea outfit. China will be the first real test, given they dealt with Thailand 6-1 on Friday and brushed aside Taiwan 5-0 in tonight\u2019s first fixture. In solid proof that much can happen over three days in football, Milicic has made six changes to his starting XI and nine months\u2019 worth of water has poured into Sydney\u2019s catchments, putting Campbelltown\u2019s drainage system under more pressure than anyone in Emily van Egmond\u2019s way on Friday night. \u201cTo be fair, the ground at Campbelltown was really good considering the conditions,\u201d said the midfielder and provider of three assists against Taiwan. \u201cI think the rain the other night on the field was probably a good thing. I think it actually made the speed of the game a little bit quicker. It was just like wetting the pitch before any normal game. We have definitely played in worse conditions than what we experienced the other night.\u201d In terms of team changes, Ellie Carpenter, Aivi Luik, Alanna Kennedy (captain), Emily Gielnik, Mackenzie Arnold and Katrina Gorry are all in. They take the place of Clare Polkinghorne, Catley, Chloe Logarzo, Elise Kellond-Knight, Lydia Williams and Raso. As ever, get in touch with any thoughts via Email or tweet @emmavkemp",

The surprise announcement comes in the middle of a major row over the centre-right party\u2019s \u201cfirewall\u201d against the far-right, after CDU delegates in eastern Germany defied the party headquarter\u2019s ban on cooperating with the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD). Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, 57, won the contest to succeed Merkel as leader of the CDU in December 2018 and was seen as the candidate most likely to continue the current German chancellor\u2019s centrist course. But \u201cAKK\u201d, as she has come to be known in German media, has struggled to build a profile in Merkel\u2019s shadow, even after doubling up as defence minister last July. \u201cI will not run for chancellor,\u201d Kramp-Karrenbauer told a news conference in Berlin on Monday, adding that she had been building up to the decision for some time and that she made it \u201cwith the intention of strengthening the CDU\u201d. \u201cIn my view, this has no impact on the stability of the grand coalition,\u201d she said, referring to the national coalition between Merkel\u2019s conservatives and the Social Democrats. Questions over her control over an increasingly divided CDU returned to the fore last week, when politicians from the party\u2019s branch in Thuringia voted with the AfD to oust the state\u2019s premier Bodo Ramelow, from the leftwing Die Linke party. Merkel\u2019s unusual decision to intervene in the affair, announcing that it was \u201cunforgivable\u201d for democratic parties to win majorities with the help of the AfD, accentuated Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s lack of authority. Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s standing was further diminished when the CDU\u2019s Thuringia branch defied her call to dissolve the state parliament and call a fresh election. On Monday morning news magazine Der Spiegel reported that Kramp-Karrenbauer had cited the unclear positions of certain elements in her party towards the AfD and Die Linke as the reason for her resignation, and reiterated that she was against cooperations with both parties. Merkel said she accepted the resignation of her designated successor, who was previously a state premier in the Saarland on the border with France, while also letting it be known that she would like AKK to stay on as defence minister. \u201cI regard this decision with the deepest respect, though I also have to say I greatly regret it,\u201d Merkel told a news conference on Monday afternoon. \u201cI can imagine this wasn\u2019t an easy decision for her and I thank her for being prepared to stay on to steer the process of choosing a successor.\u201d The vacant seat at the top of Germany\u2019s most powerful party since 1945 opens up a debate over the country\u2019s political direction of travel in the post-Merkel period.

The four new cases \u2013 three men and one woman \u2013 were transferred from Brighton, where they were diagnosed, to London over the weekend in order to receive specialist care. Public Health England (PHE) later confirmed that two of the four were healthcare workers. Of those in the UK now diagnosed with the virus, five were closely linked to a businessman who was told he had the disease last week in Brighton. The development came as the UK government declared the coronavirus outbreak a serious and imminent threat to public health, a step that gives authorities additional powers to fight its spread. One of the latest group to be diagnosed is a male doctor who was part of a group skiing in a resort near Chamonix in France with the man at the centre of the Brighton outbreak, the Guardian understands. The other three patients were also infected on the skiing trip. The businessman is being treated at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in south London, one of the NHS\u2019s network of specialist high-consequence infectious diseases (HCID) treatment centres in England. A GP practice in Brighton, the County Oak Medical Centre, had been closed after a doctor there tested positive for the virus. It said it had closed its doors \u201cbecause of an urgent operational health and safety reason\u201d. People wearing protective full-body suits and gloves were seen cleaning the centre. Staff at the Cornerstone Community Centre in Hove told the area\u2019s Argus newspaper that they had been told to self-isolate as a man with the virus had attended a yoga class there last week. One of the other four confirmed cases is being treated at the HCID unit at the Royal Free hospital in north London, and the two Chinese nationals who tested positive for coronavirus in York are being treated at the HCID centre in Newcastle. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said that eight people had tested positive for coronavirus in the UK out of 1,114 tested as of 2pm Monday. \u201cFour further patients in England have tested positive for novel coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to eight,\u201d he said.

The new designation by the Department of Health follows reports that a British man who caught coronavirus at a business conference in Singapore had been linked to at least seven other confirmed cases in England, France and Spain.

      "bodyText": "In the example clues below, I explain the two parts of each: the definition of the answer, given in bold type, and the wordplay \u2013 the recipe for assembling its letters. In a genuine puzzle environment, of course, you also have the crossing letters, which greatly alleviate your solving load. Hence \u201ccrossword\u201d. The explanations contain links to previous entries in this series on such matters as spelling one word backwards to reveal another. And setters\u2019 names tend to link to interviews, in case you feel like getting to know these people better. The cargo of cryptic clues is laden with many abbreviations. You will be familiar with most of them: \u201cafterthought\u201d usually means PS, like you might write at the end of an email; and \u201cnowadays\u201d may mean AD, as you might see in a date. Other abbreviations, though, are more \u2026 peculiar, which is why often the best way to get used to cryptics is to share the solving with a friend or family member who has absorbed the conventions. Today\u2019s bits and pieces, for example, are likely to be familiar only if you\u2019re solving on shore leave from active naval service, possibly in the 19th century, when crosswords hadn\u2019t yet appeared. They will soon become second nature, though. Tar This is the perfect example. You doubtless won\u2019t have heard a sailor referred to as a \u201ctar\u201d \u2026 at all. But because they find tarpaulin useful, \u201csailor\u201d in a clue was once a fair way to hint at TAR in an answer, and the convention has stuck. Here\u2019s a recent example from Gordius \u2026 18ac Savour impertinence from sailors? (6,5) [ wordplay: synonym for \u2018sailor\u2019 twice (because \u2018sailors\u2019) + synonym for \u2018impertinence\u2019 ] [ TAR + TAR + SAUCE ] [ definition: savour (as a noun, not a verb) ] \u2026 and this being a prize puzzle, an explanation is available for all its answers, including TARTAR SAUCE. AB In the same vein is AB. An able seaman (a rank below leading seaman) is, in naval abbreviations, an AB. And so when Boatman \u2013 a setter especially given to seafaring clues \u2013 writes this in a puzzle of last month \u2026 17ac Boatman \u2014 to relish, ultimately, or detest (5) [ wordplay: abbrev. indicating \u2018boatman\u2019 + last letter of (\u2018ultimately\u2019) RELISH + OR (\u2018or\u2019) ] [ AB + H + OR ] [ definition: detest ] \u2026 we use AB to get ABHOR. Let\u2019s sidestep the controversy among those who enjoy such controversies about why AB might denote \u201cable seaman\u201d (thinking \u201cable-bodied seaman\u201d is a good way of remembering AB); what a solver needs to know is that an able seaman is superior to an ordinary seaman and so \u201csailor\u201d and the like may sometimes \u2013 though not often \u2013 indicate OS. Jack I wrote \u201c\u2018sailor\u2019 and the like\u2019\u201d for a reason. There\u2019s no shortage of slang terms for seamen, and so lots of ways of indicating AB, TAR and OS. Setters being devious creatures, they like to use those which will appear at first to mean something else: \u201csalt\u201d, \u201crating\u201d, \u201cgob\u201d and so on. Here\u2019s Nutmeg \u2026 16ac Standard sailor suit has one (4) [ definition: synonym for \u2018flag\u2019 (\u2018standard\u2019) / slang for \u2018sailor\u2019 / something a suit in playing cards has one of ] \u2026 and a clue where she pulls off a triple definition. Let\u2019s have something more familiar next? RN As the RAF is to the skies, the Royal Navy is to the seas. So when Chifonie uses the word \u201cnavy\u201d \u2026 9ac Embellish trouble with the navy (5) [ wordplay: synonym for \u2018trouble\u2019 + abbrev. for \u2018the navy\u2019 ] [ ADO + RN ] [ definition: embellish ] \u2026 we swap that for RN, en route to ADORN. Finally for now \u2026 SS Maritime pedants may bristle at the use of \u201cSS\u201d for boats more modern than steamships; again, all we need to remember in crosswords is that when something is \u201con board\u201d, it can be quite literally inside the letters S and S. Imogen uses that trick \u2026 13ac On board ship are people with non-PC views (7) [ wordplay: inside SS (\u2018on board ship\u2019), synonym for \u2018are\u2019 ] [ EXIST inside SS ] [ definition: people with non-PC views ] \u2026 in this clue for SEXISTS. Of course, \u201cship\u201d might refer to some actual ship, so it\u2019s good to keep in mind those vessels with letters that setters find useful: ARGO, ARK, SCOW and even DHOW. Before long, you will forget there was ever a time when you didn\u2019t think of sailors as TARS. Bon voyage! Newcomers: any questions? And seasoned solvers: what nautical tips have I missed?

      "body": "<p>In just a month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">the coronavirus outbreak</a> has snowballed from a handful of cases to more than 40,000, reaching four continents and prompting an all-out battle to stop the spread across China and beyond. As those in Wuhan face shortages of hospital beds and supplies that have been likened to \u201cwartime conditions\u201d, experts and scientists are attempting to trace out the possible paths that the virus might take.</p> \n<h2>Can it be contained?</h2> \n<p>When Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) hit in 2002, after an initial surge in cases, the epidemic fizzled out. However, many experts believe the chances of this happening with <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/23/its-been-sequenced-its-spread-across-borders-now-the-new-pneumonia-causing-virus-needs-a-name/\">2019-nCoV</a> are looking increasingly slim. In fact, the odds may have been more difficult even from the start of the latest outbreak, according to David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). \u201cSars emerged in one or two people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis current outbreak it seems was quite explosive at the start \u2013 it was many different people infected at the start, and they each set off their own chain of transmission.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although the difference in initial case numbers may sound small \u2013 two people versus 16, say \u2013 in an epidemic where numbers of infections are doubling every five days that could have set back containment efforts by several weeks.</p> \n<p>It is too early to calculate how effective quarantines have been in containing the spread. A slight levelling off in the number of global cases over the past few days has been taken by some as a cause for optimism, although this may also reflect difficulties in recording cases.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/coronacharts10feb-zip/giv-3902cLQ77wfhT4KD/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/coronacharts10feb-zip/giv-3902cLQ77wfhT4KD/\">Graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>On Sunday, World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that cases of the coronavirus being transmitted by people who had never been to China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/coronavirus-who-warns-spread-by-people-who-had-not-visited-china-could-be-tip-of-the-iceberg\">could be \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d</a>, while on Monday the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/coronavirus-uk-declares-outbreak-serious-threat-to-health\">declared the virus \u201ca serious and imminent threat to public health\u201d</a> after four new cases were diagnosed in the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne has to be a little bit pessimistic at this stage,\u201d said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at LSHTM. \u201cThere are a large number of cases in China, even though they\u2019re putting in place these draconian measures to contain it. It\u2019s looking increasingly likely that it will become well-established in China. The likelihood is then that it will leak to other countries.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cMy pessimistic view at this stage is that it is likely to become quite widespread and will be around for some time.\u201d</p> \n<h2>If it\u2019s not contained, will it be here to stay?</h2> \n<p>Some coronaviruses are seasonal and so it is possible that the number of cases may begin to dampen down as spring comes. But if the virus is already widespread by that point, it does not necessarily mean it is gone for good \u2013 just like flu, coronavirus could rear its head again next winter, at which point it would be considered an endemic human disease.</p> \n<p>There are already four circulating coronaviruses (chances are you have had one \u2013 they cause about a quarter of common colds) that originally made the leap to humans from cows, bats and other animals.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/burberry-impact-coronavirus-hong-kong-china\">Burberry says impact of coronavirus worse than Hong Kong protests</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cCoronaviruses have established themselves before. We have four of them that cause common cold-like illness,\u201d said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cThere\u2019s a very high chance that can be the fifth.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the coronavirus is still circulating in a year, its impact could be lessened by a level of immunity in the population and, possibly, the availability of vaccine to protect health workers and those most vulnerable. \u201cThis is the situation where a vaccine will become relevant,\u201d said Smith.</p> \n<h2>Could the virus mutate?</h2> \n<p>Tests so far suggest that the coronavirus is relatively stable but as it is passed from human to human the virus will become more adapted as a human disease. This is not necessarily a bad thing, though. \u201cIn Darwinian terms, the virus wants to survive,\u201d said Smith. \u201cAnd to do that it\u2019s generally not a sensible idea for a virus to kill people.

      "bodyText": "In just a month, the coronavirus outbreak has snowballed from a handful of cases to more than 40,000, reaching four continents and prompting an all-out battle to stop the spread across China and beyond. As those in Wuhan face shortages of hospital beds and supplies that have been likened to \u201cwartime conditions\u201d, experts and scientists are attempting to trace out the possible paths that the virus might take. Can it be contained? When Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) hit in 2002, after an initial surge in cases, the epidemic fizzled out. However, many experts believe the chances of this happening with 2019-nCoV are looking increasingly slim. In fact, the odds may have been more difficult even from the start of the latest outbreak, according to David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). \u201cSars emerged in one or two people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis current outbreak it seems was quite explosive at the start \u2013 it was many different people infected at the start, and they each set off their own chain of transmission.\u201d Although the difference in initial case numbers may sound small \u2013 two people versus 16, say \u2013 in an epidemic where numbers of infections are doubling every five days that could have set back containment efforts by several weeks. It is too early to calculate how effective quarantines have been in containing the spread. A slight levelling off in the number of global cases over the past few days has been taken by some as a cause for optimism, although this may also reflect difficulties in recording cases. On Sunday, World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that cases of the coronavirus being transmitted by people who had never been to China could be \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d, while on Monday the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, declared the virus \u201ca serious and imminent threat to public health\u201d after four new cases were diagnosed in the country. \u201cOne has to be a little bit pessimistic at this stage,\u201d said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at LSHTM. \u201cThere are a large number of cases in China, even though they\u2019re putting in place these draconian measures to contain it. It\u2019s looking increasingly likely that it will become well-established in China. The likelihood is then that it will leak to other countries.\u201d \u201cMy pessimistic view at this stage is that it is likely to become quite widespread and will be around for some time.\u201d If it\u2019s not contained, will it be here to stay? Some coronaviruses are seasonal and so it is possible that the number of cases may begin to dampen down as spring comes. But if the virus is already widespread by that point, it does not necessarily mean it is gone for good \u2013 just like flu, coronavirus could rear its head again next winter, at which point it would be considered an endemic human disease. There are already four circulating coronaviruses (chances are you have had one \u2013 they cause about a quarter of common colds) that originally made the leap to humans from cows, bats and other animals. \u201cCoronaviruses have established themselves before. We have four of them that cause common cold-like illness,\u201d said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cThere\u2019s a very high chance that can be the fifth.\u201d If the coronavirus is still circulating in a year, its impact could be lessened by a level of immunity in the population and, possibly, the availability of vaccine to protect health workers and those most vulnerable. \u201cThis is the situation where a vaccine will become relevant,\u201d said Smith. Could the virus mutate? Tests so far suggest that the coronavirus is relatively stable but as it is passed from human to human the virus will become more adapted as a human disease. This is not necessarily a bad thing, though. \u201cIn Darwinian terms, the virus wants to survive,\u201d said Smith. \u201cAnd to do that it\u2019s generally not a sensible idea for a virus to kill people. The most successful viruses infect a lot of people and cause relatively little pathology.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that coronaviruses do not undergo the same type of genome shuffling that leads to the constantly shifting variety of flu strains in circulation. It is this genetic drift that means new flu vaccines have to be created each year and that means getting the flu once does not mean you\u2019ll be immune next time it comes around. The coronavirus is not expected to mutate this rapidly and so once a vaccine is here, it should continue to work far into the future. When will a vaccine be ready? Teams around the world are racing to produce a vaccine, with some vaccine candidates already being tested in animals, just weeks after the coronavirus DNA sequence was released. Jeff Richardson of Inovio Pharmaceuticals, one of the teams backed by funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), said the team\u2019s DNA-based vaccine is already being manufactured on a larger scale for human testing projected to start early summer. A team from the University of Queensland, also backed by Cepi, is already testing its vaccine in combination with a technology developed by GSK, which makes the immune system respond more strongly to vaccines, potentially lowering the dose required by a factor of four.

      "bodyText": "The government has defended its decision to push ahead with an imminent deportation flight to Jamaica despite last-minute legal challenges by people due to be on board, and concerns that Windrush citizens could be among those removed. More than 100 cross-party MPs and peers have signed a letter to Boris Johnson calling for the flight to be postponed pending recommendations from a review into Windrush, while Labour said there was a worry British nationals could be involved. The letter also cited concerns about the potential deportees\u2019 access to legal advice and mobile phones, and how many had been in the UK since they were children. But asked about the flight, due to leave on Tuesday \u2013 only the second the Home Office has chartered to Jamaica since the Windrush scandal \u2013 Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cAll due process will have been followed.\u201d He told Sky News: \u201cThe people on this plane are people who have committed very serious crimes, whether it\u2019s rape, manslaughter, murder. \u201cThese are serious offences and we have a established process for ensuring that where we have foreign nationals who have committed crimes here, they should be, where possible, deported. That\u2019s something that\u2019s sensible and proportionate.\u201d Not all those on the flight have committed such serious crimes.

Speculation that Chelsea have already agreed a deal with Ajax to sign Andr\u00e9 Onana this summer suggests Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s future at Stamford Bridge is less than assured. The young Spanish goalkeeper was dropped by Frank Lampard for Chelsea\u2019s most recent match against Leicester and it remains to be seen how he will react to this career setback after having the entirety of the winter break to stew on it. Chelsea are also reported to be keen on Everton\u2019s Brazilian winger Richarlison, while the agent of their midfielder, Jorginho, says his client is open to a reunion with Maurizio Sarri at Juventus. Weekend reports suggest the Italian champions are open to letting Aaron Ramsey leave after just one season at the club. Arsenal like the cut of Le Havre midfield dynamo Pape Gueye\u2019s jib, but will face competition for the League 2 star\u2019s signature from Sevilla, Milan, Valencia and Udinese. Lille\u2019s 22-year-old central defender Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es also features on Arsenal\u2019s summer shopping list and it is understood he would cost them or any other suitors around \u00a330m. Meanwhile in Portugal, Sporting winger Rafael Camacho is wanted by Manchester United and Everton, having previously spent time as a boy with Manchester City and Liverpool.",

      "bodyText": "The billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson, an ardent pro-Israel conservative, is expected to donate at least $100m to boost Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election efforts and Republican congressional candidates this fall, say three Republican fundraisers familiar with Adelson\u2019s initial plans. Adelson\u2019s hefty checks are expected to be written to several Super Pacs \u2013 political groups that have to disclose their donors \u2013 as well as \u201cdark money\u201d not-for-profit organizations that can keep their donors secret, say the fundraisers. One source predicted that Adelson, who in tandem with his Israeli-born wife, Miriam, donated more than $100m to Super Pacs and dark money groups in each of the last two presidential cycles, could wind up contributing close to $200m in 2020 given their recent spending patterns and appreciation for Trump\u2019s policies. Adelson and his wife have been opening their wallets wider in the Trump era. The Adelsons, who typically give some of their bigger checks towards the end of campaigns, in 2018 spent a personal record of $124m \u2013 just in publicly disclosed donations to Super Pacs, campaign committees and candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Ever since the 2016 campaign, Adelson and Trump have courted one another, bonding more closely as Trump has tilted US policies on Israel to favor goals in sync with Adelson and other big conservative donors and activists in the Jewish and evangelical worlds. With a net worth that Forbes pegs at $39bn, Adelson has long championed several of the hardline pro-Israel moves that Trump has made, including relocating the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and ditching the Iran nuclear deal signed by the Obama administration. Last month, the Adelsons were at the White House for the unveiling of Trump\u2019s Middle East peace plan, which Palestinians and most Arab countries rejected as too favorable to Israel but Trump dubbed the \u201cdeal of the century\u201d. Before the official ceremony, Adelson met briefly with Trump, according to one source. During his presidency, Adelson has had other meetings with Trump in Washington and Las Vegas, and periodically they talk by phone, say sources. At least a handful of Super Pacs and not-for-profit groups are expected to receive seven-figure Adelson checks in 2020, including several he has backed heavily in recent cycles that are aimed at helping Trump and congressional candidates. For instance, Adelson has been a major funder and board member of the Republican Jewish Coalition, a pro-Israel lobbying group that plans a record $10m-plus drive to woo more Jewish voters in key swing states including Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which Trump is hoping to win again as he did in 2016, say RJC donors. The RJC is chaired by the ex-senator Norm Coleman, a DC lobbyist with the law firm Hogan Lovells, who is said to have strong ties to Adelson that benefit the RJC and other Super Pacs and dark money outfits where Coleman is a big player. Coleman helps lead fundraising for a Super Pac, the Congressional Leadership Fund, and a dark money outfit, the American Action Network, that respectively back Republican House members and their policies and have received seven-figure checks from the Adelsons in recent elections. In 2018, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, the Adelsons gave a whopping $55m to the Congressional Leadership Fund, which spent a total of $138m in the last elections in an unsuccessful effort to hold on to the Republican House majority.

A few days later, Adelson was in Jerusalem with a few dozen fellow board members of the RJC and some top Trump aides, including Jared Kushner, to celebrate the official ceremony marking the US embassy move to Jerusalem, a top priority for Adelson and the RJC. The veteran GOP fundraiser Mel Sembler, who also sits on the RJC board, thinks Adelson\u2019s input was significant in Trump\u2019s decisions to move the embassy and pull out of the Iranian nuclear deal. \u201cAdelson was an important factor in all these decisions,\u201d Sembler told McClatchy in May 2018.

The Giltini Group made trademark applications <a href=\"https://trademarks.justia.com/owners/giltini-group-llc-4229721/\">last year</a> for names such as \u201cGil Tai\u201d, \u201cGilacolada\u201d, \u201cGiljito\u201d, \u201cGilgarita\u201d and \u201cGilmopolitan\u201d.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.majorleague.rugby/news/austin-gilgronis-take-on-new-ownership-and-find-new-home-at-circuit-of-the-americas-for-2020-season/\">a statement</a>, the club aim to introduce festivities including a human fireball and cheerleading championships in order to deliver \u201cthe greatest rugbytainment experience in the world\u201d. Tim Prukop of COTA said in the statement that the addition of rugby to the Formula One track\u2019s facilities offers \u201cyet another way to experience the thrill of being alive\u201d.</p> <p>Reaction to the rebrand on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/usmlr/status/1222644766883450880\">social media</a> was, as they say, mixed. \u201cHonestly, this is weird as hell,\u201d one Twitter user wrote. The Gilgronis, who kicked off their 2020 season on Sunday, were approached for comment for this article but did not respond.</p> <p>Austin were decidedly un-elite in 2019: they struggled to reach four-figure attendances and lost every game. \u201cThis is a really weird and unique case because this can pan out to be a brilliant move, that everything falls into place and it\u2019s great, or it can be a disaster,\u201d says Vassilis Dalakas, professor of marketing at Cal State University San Marcos and visiting professor of sports marketing at San Diego State University.</p> <p>\u201cNo matter what the name, the simple fact that they\u2019re switching the name again is a little bit of a bold and potentially problematic decision. Having said that, they went winless last year, 0-16, so in that respect it might be a somewhat brilliant strategy because what you\u2019re trying to do is give the fans the impression that you\u2019re starting with a clean sheet, forget the past.\u201d</p> <p>Though \u201cGilgronis\u201d evokes neither toughness nor local pride, in contrast with successful brands such as the NFL\u2019s Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers, Dalakas said that in smaller leagues a corporate name \u201cmay not be as problematic, it might be a smart way for the teams to generate some extra revenue.\u201d In the gimmick-strewn minor leagues, clubs, it seems, will try anything for a buck or two (see: <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/cut4/the-weirdest-minor-league-promotions-ever-c232916050\">Salute to Indoor Plumbing Night</a>).</p> <p>Dalakas did, though, point to the apparent dissonance between the Gilgronis\u2019 stated intent to launch youth initiatives and provide a family-friendly atmosphere and the overt link with alcohol. Still, as innumerable commercials and sponsorships can attest, fandom and drinking are interlaced in popular culture. Baseball\u2019s St Louis Cardinals play at Busch Stadium, the Colorado Rockies are at Coors Field and the Milwaukee Brewers take the field at Miller Park.</p> <p>Benetton Rugby are a leading Italian team, while corporate names are commonplace in Japan, where rugby\u2019s Suntory Sungoliath (owned by the whiskey-makers) join the likes of the Toshiba Brave Lupus, the Mitsubishi DynaBoars and the NTT Communications Shining Arcs.</p> <p>The NFL\u2019s Green Bay Packers were briefly the <a href=\"https://www.packers.com/news/the-acme-packers-were-short-lived-18677091\">Acme Packers</a>. Based near Disneyland and <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/sports/a39992/mighty-ducks-movie-nhl-franchise/\">owned by Disney</a> at the time, the Anaheim Ducks of the NHL were born in 1993 as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, their name a nod to The Mighty Ducks, a 1992 kids\u2019 film starring Emilio Estevez. The Ducks shared an arena with the LA KISS, an Arena Football League side that folded in 2016 and was co-owned by two members of the rock band.</p> <p>In 2011, stars including Abby Wambach, Megan Rapinoe and Hope Solo played for <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/how-boca-raton-lost-its-all-star-pro-soccer-team-withou-5853999\">magicJack</a>, a Florida-based Women\u2019s Professional Soccer side named for its owner\u2019s phone technology business. The league folded in 2012. Originated as works teams, Bayer Leverkusen and PSV Eindhoven are among Europe\u2019s best-known football clubs, though Red Bull\u2019s recent incursion into the Bundesliga with RB Leipzig is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/german-bundesliga/story/4029702/why-rb-leipzig-is-the-most-hated-soccer-team-in-the-bundesliga\">widely resented</a> as cynically rapacious.</p> <p>The energy-drink maker took over the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in 2006, rebranding the Major League Soccer team as Red Bull New York, then the New York Red Bulls. They signed Thierry Henry, Rafa M\u00e1rquez and Tim Cahill, helping raise the profile of MLS, even if the genuflection to blatant commercialism seemed to underline the tenuous financial and cultural status of professional soccer in the US.</p> <p>But no other MLS franchise has adopted a corporate name. In fact, the league has trended in a contrasting direction. Teams are seeking to convey authenticity and gravitas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jul/21/mls-team-names-european-style-united-city\">by adopting traditional European-style handles</a> such as FC and United that are, in a North American context, affectations.</p> <p>Austin\u2019s MLS side, which enters the league in 2021, is simply called Austin FC, on the basis that the city is an inherently appealing brand that needs no embellishment, and its <a href=\"https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/explaining-austin-fcs-logo-inspired-by-the-treaty-oak/269-587067116\">logo</a> features intertwined oak trees representing \u201cthe bond between club and city\u201d.</p> <p>Hardly innovative, but it may prove a smart choice if it makes fans feel connected and influential. More than a dozen NFL franchises <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/09/13/mf.nfl.teams.names/index.html\">owe their nicknames</a> to public submissions, including the New England Patriots, Miami Dolphins and Baltimore Ravens (who are named after Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s poem, The Raven).</p> <p>Placing a business at the core of a club\u2019s identity, meanwhile, undermines the idea that teams are community symbols rather than for-profit enterprises and forces fans to think of themselves as consumers rather than supporters.</p> <p>Sports marketing is about leveraging civic pride and monetising emotional attachment, and it\u2019s hard to feel passionate if you feel less like you\u2019re being asked to root for your city, and more like you\u2019re the tool of a drinks company\u2019s advertising department.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is said that Austin\u2019s celebrated weirdness is being alloyed by corporate conformity as the Texan capital gentrifies, but its Major League Rugby club is here to show that rampant commercialism can be off-the-wall, too. In a nation known for quirky team nicknames (hello, Hartford Yard Goats, Batavia Muckdogs and Binghamton Rumble Ponies), Austin\u2019s may be the most bizarre of all. Last month, less than two weeks before the start of the third MLR season, the artists formerly known as the Austin Herd declared that they are now the Austin Gilgronis, in reference to \u201ca new Texas-sized cocktail, to be released soon\u201d. In the land of innumerable Tigers, Lions, Eagles, Knights and Bulldogs, it is rare for a professional team to adopt an explicitly corporate moniker - let alone one that promotes alcohol. Born the Austin Elite in 2017, the team rebranded as the Herd only last September, reinventing itself as the Gilgronis after being taken over by Australian investors and moving to a new home at the Circuit of the Americas (COTA), where they will share a pitch with the Austin Bold minor-league soccer team. Gilgroni is presumably a spin on Negroni, the Italian aperitif. One of the club\u2019s backers is an Australian gym tycoon named Adam Gilchrist (not the famous cricket player of the same name). The Giltini Group made trademark applications last year for names such as \u201cGil Tai\u201d, \u201cGilacolada\u201d, \u201cGiljito\u201d, \u201cGilgarita\u201d and \u201cGilmopolitan\u201d. According to a statement, the club aim to introduce festivities including a human fireball and cheerleading championships in order to deliver \u201cthe greatest rugbytainment experience in the world\u201d. Tim Prukop of COTA said in the statement that the addition of rugby to the Formula One track\u2019s facilities offers \u201cyet another way to experience the thrill of being alive\u201d. Reaction to the rebrand on social media was, as they say, mixed. \u201cHonestly, this is weird as hell,\u201d one Twitter user wrote. The Gilgronis, who kicked off their 2020 season on Sunday, were approached for comment for this article but did not respond. Austin were decidedly un-elite in 2019: they struggled to reach four-figure attendances and lost every game. \u201cThis is a really weird and unique case because this can pan out to be a brilliant move, that everything falls into place and it\u2019s great, or it can be a disaster,\u201d says Vassilis Dalakas, professor of marketing at Cal State University San Marcos and visiting professor of sports marketing at San Diego State University. \u201cNo matter what the name, the simple fact that they\u2019re switching the name again is a little bit of a bold and potentially problematic decision. Having said that, they went winless last year, 0-16, so in that respect it might be a somewhat brilliant strategy because what you\u2019re trying to do is give the fans the impression that you\u2019re starting with a clean sheet, forget the past.\u201d Though \u201cGilgronis\u201d evokes neither toughness nor local pride, in contrast with successful brands such as the NFL\u2019s Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers, Dalakas said that in smaller leagues a corporate name \u201cmay not be as problematic, it might be a smart way for the teams to generate some extra revenue.\u201d In the gimmick-strewn minor leagues, clubs, it seems, will try anything for a buck or two (see: Salute to Indoor Plumbing Night). Dalakas did, though, point to the apparent dissonance between the Gilgronis\u2019 stated intent to launch youth initiatives and provide a family-friendly atmosphere and the overt link with alcohol. Still, as innumerable commercials and sponsorships can attest, fandom and drinking are interlaced in popular culture. Baseball\u2019s St Louis Cardinals play at Busch Stadium, the Colorado Rockies are at Coors Field and the Milwaukee Brewers take the field at Miller Park. Benetton Rugby are a leading Italian team, while corporate names are commonplace in Japan, where rugby\u2019s Suntory Sungoliath (owned by the whiskey-makers) join the likes of the Toshiba Brave Lupus, the Mitsubishi DynaBoars and the NTT Communications Shining Arcs. The NFL\u2019s Green Bay Packers were briefly the Acme Packers. Based near Disneyland and owned by Disney at the time, the Anaheim Ducks of the NHL were born in 1993 as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, their name a nod to The Mighty Ducks, a 1992 kids\u2019 film starring Emilio Estevez. The Ducks shared an arena with the LA KISS, an Arena Football League side that folded in 2016 and was co-owned by two members of the rock band. In 2011, stars including Abby Wambach, Megan Rapinoe and Hope Solo played for magicJack, a Florida-based Women\u2019s Professional Soccer side named for its owner\u2019s phone technology business. The league folded in 2012. Originated as works teams, Bayer Leverkusen and PSV Eindhoven are among Europe\u2019s best-known football clubs, though Red Bull\u2019s recent incursion into the Bundesliga with RB Leipzig is widely resented as cynically rapacious. The energy-drink maker took over the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in 2006, rebranding the Major League Soccer team as Red Bull New York, then the New York Red Bulls. They signed Thierry Henry, Rafa M\u00e1rquez and Tim Cahill, helping raise the profile of MLS, even if the genuflection to blatant commercialism seemed to underline the tenuous financial and cultural status of professional soccer in the US. But no other MLS franchise has adopted a corporate name. In fact, the league has trended in a contrasting direction. Teams are seeking to convey authenticity and gravitas by adopting traditional European-style handles such as FC and United that are, in a North American context, affectations. Austin\u2019s MLS side, which enters the league in 2021, is simply called Austin FC, on the basis that the city is an inherently appealing brand that needs no embellishment, and its logo features intertwined oak trees representing \u201cthe bond between club and city\u201d. Hardly innovative, but it may prove a smart choice if it makes fans feel connected and influential. More than a dozen NFL franchises owe their nicknames to public submissions, including the New England Patriots, Miami Dolphins and Baltimore Ravens (who are named after Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s poem, The Raven). Placing a business at the core of a club\u2019s identity, meanwhile, undermines the idea that teams are community symbols rather than for-profit enterprises and forces fans to think of themselves as consumers rather than supporters. Sports marketing is about leveraging civic pride and monetising emotional attachment, and it\u2019s hard to feel passionate if you feel less like you\u2019re being asked to root for your city, and more like you\u2019re the tool of a drinks company\u2019s advertising department.",

      "body": "<p>When Sana, then a student in London hailing from Coventry, was 20 years old, she was referred to a psychotherapist. Her father had died and, miles away from home, she had begun to spiral into a depression. She became withdrawn and would lock herself away in her bedroom. Eventually, her friends persuaded her to seek help.</p> <p>\u201cIt had got to the point where I was basically paralysed and I needed some kind of escape,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThere was no other way out \u2026 I forced myself to go to the doctor.\u201d</p> <p>Sana was quickly assigned a therapist. It was the first therapist Sana had seen and she did not know what to expect. \u201cMy therapist was white, and I\u2019m assuming hadn\u2019t had much exposure to minority people because of the way that she spoke to me.\u201d</p> <p>That is because at the second session, \u201cout of the blue\u201d, the therapist started to question Sana about forced marriage. Sana had not mentioned anything about marriage, but she had mentioned her Pakistani heritage.</p> <p>\u201cI said I\u2019m here for depression and anxiety,\u201d she says. \u201cMy dad passed away, I was there for grief therapy, and I was quite clearly distressed about that particular issue.\u201d</p> <p>Sana describes how the therapist seized upon one detail \u2013 her Pakistani heritage \u2013 to make the inappropriate suggestion of why she might really be upset. \u201cShe was so unaware of how what she was asking would make me feel. It felt like she was putting me into a box.\u201d</p> <p>Experiencing this while she was at her most vulnerable made her feel worse. \u201cI thought, if this professional can\u2019t help me then I\u2019m a lost cause.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, Sana continued to attend sessions: \u201cI didn\u2019t feel I could say could say anything because I was given the sessions through the NHS. I didn\u2019t want to be ungrateful.</p> <p>\u201cBut I knew I couldn\u2019t open up to this woman. I was holding back every time she\u2019d try to get deeper. I think she sensed it because after a few sessions she said: \u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting very far. I think you\u2019d be better suited to somebody else.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sana was assigned to a new therapist to complete the rest of her treatment.</p> <p>Those from a black and minority ethnic (BME) community are at greater risk of developing mental health conditions than their white counterparts. There is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30484715\" title=\"\">a growing body of research</a> to suggest that regular exposure to racism increases the chances of developing psychosis and depression, while other mental health risk factors such as poverty, higher unemployment and lower educational outcomes tend to have an impact on BME Brits.</p> <p>Despite this need, an independent review of the Mental Health Act, which was submitted to the government in 2018, found that \u201cprofound inequalities\u201d exist for BME patients accessing mental health services. The report focused primarily on the overrepresentation of BME in-patients in psychiatric units: black British people are four times more likely to be sectioned than white patients. BME patients are also more likely to be given medication rather than being offered talking therapies (eg counselling and psychotherapy).</p> <p>These factors, alongside the lack of diversity in the mental health workforce, were identified as contributing to widespread distrust in the system, which may be preventing BME patients from accessing help at an earlier, more treatable stage.</p> <p>Specific attitudes toward mental health may also be a factor. In south Asian communities, mental illness can carry a taboo, with some believing that it could affect marriage prospects, bring shame upon a family or that the causes and cures of illness can be linked to religion.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a long history of oppression towards people of colour in psychiatry,\u201d says Eugene Ellis, the founder of the Black, African and Asian Therapy Network (BAATN). \u201cAnd [BME patients] may see all of it \u2013 psychotherapy, counselling \u2013 as the same.\u201d</p> <p>But the problems for BME patients are not limited to psychiatry. In 2013, the mental health charity Mind conducted <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/media/494424/we-still-need-to-talk_report.pdf\" title=\"\">a report for the</a><a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/media/494424/we-still-need-to-talk_report.pdf\" title=\"\"> coalition government</a> on improving access to talking therapies. With BME patients, their findings were shocking: only 10% of those surveyed felt that their talking therapy service adequately took into consideration their cultural background, with a third of the respondents believing that the service was not fit for BME people.</p> <p>However, surveyed professionals rated themselves more highly, with 75% of therapists saying their service did meet the cultural needs of BME patients. It is this difference that forms the loudest complaint from BME patients \u2013 that is, therapists don\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d. BME patients complain about their therapists gaslighting them if they talk about racism they have experienced, with some even becoming defensive; others point to racial stereotyping and a lack of understanding about cultural nuances.</p> <p>I have some personal experience with this. Years ago, I saw a therapist who I felt I was making progress with. We had spent time making sense of difficult past relationships, some of which had at points become abusive. Then one day, she advised me to cut off the problematic family members. This, I tried to explain, was not so simple for a woman of south Asian heritage where family units operate differently; if I were to cut off these members it would have consequences and I did not think I could cope with the additional drama.</p> <p>Plus, I didn\u2019t agree with the assessment. I didn\u2019t want to remove my family \u2013 many of whom had suffered their own traumas \u2013 I simply wanted to move past what had happened, and ensure I made healthier choices in future.</p> <p>But each week, she would ask me if I had yet severed the ties. I felt ashamed when I said I hadn\u2019t, as though I was a disappointment to her. It made our sessions tense and unproductive, and was an experience that put me off therapy for many years.</p> <p>It is not a given that a therapist from an ethnic minority background will understand a BME patient in exactly the way they require. But in the same way a woman may feel more comfortable speaking to another woman when discussing experiences relating to their sex, a person of colour may feel safer speaking to someone with similar racialised experiences. A quick solution therefore might be for BME patients to be treated by therapists of colour.</p> <p>However, this is not always possible. First there is the issue of geography, with patients living outside cities having fewer choices. Increasing the number of BME therapists may help this but, according to Ellis, there seems to be a <a href=\"https://www.baatn.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Updating-Psychotherapy-Training.pdf\" title=\"\">higher dropout rate</a> in therapy courses for BME candidates, who too can become frustrated by a lack of understanding about race from largely white therapy training providers.</p> <p>This is something Ellis has noticed in his work at BAATN, which was set up as a place for patients to quickly locate a BME therapist, before growing to become a professional hub for therapists of colour offering events, training and membership.</p> <p>\u201cIn psychotherapy as part of your training, you\u2019re invited to speak about yourself because you need to know yourself if you\u2019re going to help others,\u201d says Ellis. \u201cA large part of that will be [the therapist of colour\u2019s] racial identity.</p> <p>\u201cBut people don\u2019t know how to talk about race, they feel uncomfortable, the facilitators don\u2019t say anything, until eventually the comments come \u2013 \u2018Why do you keep talking about it?\u2019 or \u2018Get over it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In response to this, BAATN has set up its own mentoring programme to give trainees a space to be heard and to speak more effectively in their training programmes.</p> <p>Class also plays a large factor. \u201cEverything in therapy \u2013 the way that people talk, their language and their expectations \u2013 is organised around middle-class values,\u201d says Ellis. People will have some experience of this approach if they have been to university, but it can be difficult for those who have not. It is interesting to note that people are more likely to train as therapists if they have received therapy previously, and are more likely to go to therapy if someone they know has. This is much more common in university-educated, middle-class circles.</p> <p>But the hurdles continue even after training, as the system incentivises therapists to treat private patients who tend to be white and middle class.</p> <p>\u201cIf you wanted to work within your community, it\u2019s more of a challenge,\u201d says Ellis. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to work in the NHS where you\u2019re likely to meet that same racism again. So a lot of people just get worn out and leave.\u201d</p> <p>Ellis believes that all therapists \u2013 regardless of their own race \u2013 need to undergo some kind of training to help them treat BME patients, and to help therapists overcome their discomfort at talking about race. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t really matter what kind of identity you are as a therapist,\u201d says Ellis, pointing out that specialist counsellors in bereavement or sexual abuse don\u2019t necessarily have had to experience those things personally. Rather, they need space in training to get to grips with the issues. But \u201cthe profession just doesn\u2019t train counsellors to [deal with race] as standard\u201d.</p> <p>The type of therapy may also have a bearing on outcomes for BME patients. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has become the dominant form of therapy offered by the NHS. CBT focuses on present moments rather than past experiences and is designed to alter negative thought patterns; it is a far cry from the stereotypical therapy setup of a patient on a chaise longue, spending years poring over childhood. Instead, CBT is a task-oriented, structured programme designed to quickly deliver results, often in as little as 10 sessions.</p> <p>To its critics, CBT has become so common because it is inexpensive to administer and focused on getting people back to work. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a lot of training to give someone a CBT programme,\u201d says Ellis. \u201cSo staff [delivering it] can be paid fairly cheaply.\u201d</p> <p>But at the heart of its approach is the notion that, whatever distress the patient is feeling, it is their thinking that needs to be changed. This approach may add to their trauma, particularly when therapists are dealing with communities that are likely to be expressing distress due to very real political and social issues.</p> <p><a href=\"https://racereflections.co.uk/2017/01/11/culturally-biased-therapy-epistemic-violence-and-cbt/comment-page-1/\" title=\"\">In her essay</a>, the psychologist Guilaine Kinouani criticises CBT for its silent assumptions, including \u201cthe division between the world (the objective) and us (our subjective reactions). The need for objective evidence to support our beliefs and, related to that, the requirement to doubt and reject our subjective reality and lived experience, if it cannot be objectively backed up.</p> <p>\u201cIt is one thing to encourage people to seek \u2018objective evidence\u2019 to help disprove the belief that everyone hates them, but quite another to ask people of colour to back up their belief that they are experiencing racism.\u201d</p> <p>Kinouani notes that this approach is the embodiment of western, rationalist thinking, but that there are many other worldviews that do not adhere to this. And for Ellis, this philosophical difference can have real impact on patients.</p> <p>Ellis describes the western approach to thinking as linear. \u201cIt says, \u2018This comes first and then that comes next,\u2019 so we can logically rationalise and get to an answer at the other end.\u201d</p> <p>But many people do not think in this linear way. Instead, they may \u201cthink of one thing, then something else in a more circular way. Just open to whatever\u2019s happening and then putting something together based on various bits they might be experiencing.\u201d</p> <p>Ellis notes that the linear style of thinking is hammered home in schools and universities, so if a patient is schooled in the UK (and the further they go, the more experience they will have with this approach), regardless of race they can still benefit from therapies based on it. But for people educated outside the UK, or outside the west entirely, CBT may simply not work as an approach. Moreover, due to cuts to mental health services during austerity, funding for non-CBT-focused therapies, be they music or art therapies, have been slashed. Could this go some way to explain why BME patients who do manage to access talking therapies through the NHS are still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/26/mental-health-patients-seeking-treatment-face-postcode-lottery\" title=\"\">less likely to regain their health</a>?</p> <p>Despite the problems, there are many, many BME therapy success stories. Mandi was working in the Welsh tech sector when she started seeing a counsellor. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many BME people in the general population, never mind the therapy profession,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI had the space in that therapy relationship to explore all that I needed to \u2026 any cultural nuances I needed to explain, I could.</p> <p>\u201cMy positive experience makes me hopeful that more in the profession will exercise the same level of professionalism and kindness to help break down cultural barriers.\u201d</p> <p>For those who don\u2019t find the right therapist the first time, recovery is still possible. Sana completed her sessions with her second therapist without issue. \u201cShe was much more focused on treating me for grief, which can happen to anyone.\u201d</p> <p>But it is with her latest therapist \u2013 whom she has been seeing for well over a year \u2013 that she has made the most progress. \u201cHe is a white man. And he started off by asking me about my previous therapist \u2013 what I liked and did not like \u2013 so I told him about the first lady and the forced marriage thing. And he thought that was ridiculous and he made that very clear.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve not felt judged by him. If he doesn\u2019t understand something he asks me questions inquisitively, and is understanding. He is just so good. Because he listens and he never makes assumptions.\u201d</p>",

In south Asian communities, mental illness can carry a taboo, with some believing that it could affect marriage prospects, bring shame upon a family or that the causes and cures of illness can be linked to religion. \u201cThere\u2019s a long history of oppression towards people of colour in psychiatry,\u201d says Eugene Ellis, the founder of the Black, African and Asian Therapy Network (BAATN). \u201cAnd [BME patients] may see all of it \u2013 psychotherapy, counselling \u2013 as the same.\u201d But the problems for BME patients are not limited to psychiatry. In 2013, the mental health charity Mind conducted a report for the coalition government on improving access to talking therapies. With BME patients, their findings were shocking: only 10% of those surveyed felt that their talking therapy service adequately took into consideration their cultural background, with a third of the respondents believing that the service was not fit for BME people. However, surveyed professionals rated themselves more highly, with 75% of therapists saying their service did meet the cultural needs of BME patients. It is this difference that forms the loudest complaint from BME patients \u2013 that is, therapists don\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d. BME patients complain about their therapists gaslighting them if they talk about racism they have experienced, with some even becoming defensive; others point to racial stereotyping and a lack of understanding about cultural nuances. I have some personal experience with this. Years ago, I saw a therapist who I felt I was making progress with. We had spent time making sense of difficult past relationships, some of which had at points become abusive. Then one day, she advised me to cut off the problematic family members. This, I tried to explain, was not so simple for a woman of south Asian heritage where family units operate differently; if I were to cut off these members it would have consequences and I did not think I could cope with the additional drama. Plus, I didn\u2019t agree with the assessment. I didn\u2019t want to remove my family \u2013 many of whom had suffered their own traumas \u2013 I simply wanted to move past what had happened, and ensure I made healthier choices in future. But each week, she would ask me if I had yet severed the ties. I felt ashamed when I said I hadn\u2019t, as though I was a disappointment to her. It made our sessions tense and unproductive, and was an experience that put me off therapy for many years. It is not a given that a therapist from an ethnic minority background will understand a BME patient in exactly the way they require. But in the same way a woman may feel more comfortable speaking to another woman when discussing experiences relating to their sex, a person of colour may feel safer speaking to someone with similar racialised experiences. A quick solution therefore might be for BME patients to be treated by therapists of colour. However, this is not always possible. First there is the issue of geography, with patients living outside cities having fewer choices. Increasing the number of BME therapists may help this but, according to Ellis, there seems to be a higher dropout rate in therapy courses for BME candidates, who too can become frustrated by a lack of understanding about race from largely white therapy training providers. This is something Ellis has noticed in his work at BAATN, which was set up as a place for patients to quickly locate a BME therapist, before growing to become a professional hub for therapists of colour offering events, training and membership. \u201cIn psychotherapy as part of your training, you\u2019re invited to speak about yourself because you need to know yourself if you\u2019re going to help others,\u201d says Ellis. \u201cA large part of that will be [the therapist of colour\u2019s] racial identity. \u201cBut people don\u2019t know how to talk about race, they feel uncomfortable, the facilitators don\u2019t say anything, until eventually the comments come \u2013 \u2018Why do you keep talking about it?\u2019 or \u2018Get over it.\u2019\u201d In response to this, BAATN has set up its own mentoring programme to give trainees a space to be heard and to speak more effectively in their training programmes. Class also plays a large factor. \u201cEverything in therapy \u2013 the way that people talk, their language and their expectations \u2013 is organised around middle-class values,\u201d says Ellis. People will have some experience of this approach if they have been to university, but it can be difficult for those who have not. It is interesting to note that people are more likely to train as therapists if they have received therapy previously, and are more likely to go to therapy if someone they know has. This is much more common in university-educated, middle-class circles. But the hurdles continue even after training, as the system incentivises therapists to treat private patients who tend to be white and middle class. \u201cIf you wanted to work within your community, it\u2019s more of a challenge,\u201d says Ellis. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to work in the NHS where you\u2019re likely to meet that same racism again. So a lot of people just get worn out and leave.\u201d Ellis believes that all therapists \u2013 regardless of their own race \u2013 need to undergo some kind of training to help them treat BME patients, and to help therapists overcome their discomfort at talking about race. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t really matter what kind of identity you are as a therapist,\u201d says Ellis, pointing out that specialist counsellors in bereavement or sexual abuse don\u2019t necessarily have had to experience those things personally. Rather, they need space in training to get to grips with the issues. But \u201cthe profession just doesn\u2019t train counsellors to [deal with race] as standard\u201d. The type of therapy may also have a bearing on outcomes for BME patients. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has become the dominant form of therapy offered by the NHS. CBT focuses on present moments rather than past experiences and is designed to alter negative thought patterns; it is a far cry from the stereotypical therapy setup of a patient on a chaise longue, spending years poring over childhood. Instead, CBT is a task-oriented, structured programme designed to quickly deliver results, often in as little as 10 sessions. To its critics, CBT has become so common because it is inexpensive to administer and focused on getting people back to work. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a lot of training to give someone a CBT programme,\u201d says Ellis. \u201cSo staff [delivering it] can be paid fairly cheaply.\u201d But at the heart of its approach is the notion that, whatever distress the patient is feeling, it is their thinking that needs to be changed. This approach may add to their trauma, particularly when therapists are dealing with communities that are likely to be expressing distress due to very real political and social issues. In her essay, the psychologist Guilaine Kinouani criticises CBT for its silent assumptions, including \u201cthe division between the world (the objective) and us (our subjective reactions). The need for objective evidence to support our beliefs and, related to that, the requirement to doubt and reject our subjective reality and lived experience, if it cannot be objectively backed up. \u201cIt is one thing to encourage people to seek \u2018objective evidence\u2019 to help disprove the belief that everyone hates them, but quite another to ask people of colour to back up their belief that they are experiencing racism.\u201d Kinouani notes that this approach is the embodiment of western, rationalist thinking, but that there are many other worldviews that do not adhere to this. And for Ellis, this philosophical difference can have real impact on patients. Ellis describes the western approach to thinking as linear. \u201cIt says, \u2018This comes first and then that comes next,\u2019 so we can logically rationalise and get to an answer at the other end.\u201d But many people do not think in this linear way. Instead, they may \u201cthink of one thing, then something else in a more circular way. Just open to whatever\u2019s happening and then putting something together based on various bits they might be experiencing.\u201d Ellis notes that the linear style of thinking is hammered home in schools and universities, so if a patient is schooled in the UK (and the further they go, the more experience they will have with this approach), regardless of race they can still benefit from therapies based on it. But for people educated outside the UK, or outside the west entirely, CBT may simply not work as an approach. Moreover, due to cuts to mental health services during austerity, funding for non-CBT-focused therapies, be they music or art therapies, have been slashed. Could this go some way to explain why BME patients who do manage to access talking therapies through the NHS are still less likely to regain their health? Despite the problems, there are many, many BME therapy success stories. Mandi was working in the Welsh tech sector when she started seeing a counsellor. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many BME people in the general population, never mind the therapy profession,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI had the space in that therapy relationship to explore all that I needed to \u2026 any cultural nuances I needed to explain, I could. \u201cMy positive experience makes me hopeful that more in the profession will exercise the same level of professionalism and kindness to help break down cultural barriers.\u201d For those who don\u2019t find the right therapist the first time, recovery is still possible. Sana completed her sessions with her second therapist without issue. \u201cShe was much more focused on treating me for grief, which can happen to anyone.\u201d But it is with her latest therapist \u2013 whom she has been seeing for well over a year \u2013 that she has made the most progress. \u201cHe is a white man. And he started off by asking me about my previous therapist \u2013 what I liked and did not like \u2013 so I told him about the first lady and the forced marriage thing. And he thought that was ridiculous and he made that very clear. \u201cI\u2019ve not felt judged by him. If he doesn\u2019t understand something he asks me questions inquisitively, and is understanding. He is just so good. Because he listens and he never makes assumptions.\u201d",

Will Unwin 7) Ex-Manchester United duo shine in Milan derby Internazionale reminded Manchester United what they were lacking on Sunday night, as Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Romelu Lukaku both put in impressive displays to help turn the Milan derby on its head. The Chilean did brilliantly to assist Mat\u00edas Vecino, getting in behind the Milan defence with an intelligent run and then setting up his teammate for the easier chance, despite having the opportunity to shoot himself. Lukaku was a constant danger for Inter, eventually getting his reward late on thanks to clever movement at the back post from where he carefully guided a Victor Moses cross into the corner. If United\u2019s management had dealt with the duo better they could have been doing the same at Old Trafford but instead Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is left to rely on inferior players.

Attracting younger audiences is crucial for the BBC at the moment as it faces a battle with the government over the future of its funding in the face of rivals such as streaming giants Netflix and Amazon.

But in view of France\u2019s 45-10 demolition of Italy on Saturday, the value of England\u2019s win became even clearer. Italy had beaten Wales away the previous week, but were blown away by Les Bleus in Limoges. It seems certain that England, whose second match against Scotland was postponed due to Storm Ciara, cannot afford to slip up if they are to defend their Six Nations title. France are contenders but it is Ireland who top the table after an emphatic victory of their own, 31-12 at home against Wales on Sunday. They are top, with nine points from two matches, and England know they have their work cut out. <strong>Luke McLaughlin</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39ed7dc6e58579d3466e88cebbe82c83a5f009c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39ed7dc6e58579d3466e88cebbe82c83a5f009c1/0_142_3728_2237/1000.jpg\" alt=\"France\u2019s Pauline Bourdon breaks a tackle during Saturday\u2019s crushing Women\u2019s Six Nations win against Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">France\u2019s Pauline Bourdon breaks a tackle during Saturday\u2019s crushing Women\u2019s Six Nations win against Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Lachenaud/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>7) Italy\u2019s game is still clearly a work in progress</strong></h2> <p>The Azzurri showed ambition against France, as they had in Cardiff, and produced well-worked tries, but for all the individual excellence of their back row, they could do with another Mauro Bergamasco. Too many moves ended because forwards, and backs, were standing in anticipation of the ball being moved rather than making sure it was secured. They were too often turned over and need to get Jake Polledri using his strength over the ball at times and not just on the charge or in the tackle. Italy have the bits and pieces, but not the detail. Scotland next, at home. <strong>Paul Rees</strong></p>",

It seems certain that England, whose second match against Scotland was postponed due to Storm Ciara, cannot afford to slip up if they are to defend their Six Nations title. France are contenders but it is Ireland who top the table after an emphatic victory of their own, 31-12 at home against Wales on Sunday. They are top, with nine points from two matches, and England know they have their work cut out. Luke McLaughlin 7) Italy\u2019s game is still clearly a work in progress The Azzurri showed ambition against France, as they had in Cardiff, and produced well-worked tries, but for all the individual excellence of their back row, they could do with another Mauro Bergamasco. Too many moves ended because forwards, and backs, were standing in anticipation of the ball being moved rather than making sure it was secured. They were too often turned over and need to get Jake Polledri using his strength over the ball at times and not just on the charge or in the tackle. Italy have the bits and pieces, but not the detail. Scotland next, at home. Paul Rees",

      "bodyText": "A deluge of rain and wild weather could extinguish all remaining fires in New South Wales by the end of the week, the Rural Fire Service hopes. Torrential rain over three days in the state, which has been ravaged by bushfires and endured a prolonged period of drought, has already extinguished one megablaze, with the Gospers Mountain fire that has burned for months in the Hawkesbury declared out on Monday. Dams in the greater Sydney area, where water restrictions have been in place due to the drought, have also received more than their entire annual rainfall for 2019 in the space of a weekend. On Monday, Sydney\u2019s water storage levels reached 64%, up 22 points on the previous week. While the rain has been welcome news for firefighters, it has created chaos elsewhere \u2013 causing flooding, power outages and property damage. The NSW RFS said on Monday there were still 33 active fires in the state, with five of those uncontained. Only a week ago, more than 60 fires were burning across NSW and 33 of those were uncontained. The five fires that are still burning out of control are all in the Bega Valley and Snowy Valley area in the state\u2019s south. They include the Border fire and the Big Jack Mountain fire. An RFS spokesman said that \u201call going well\u201d it was likely those five fires would be out \u201cin the next 48 hours\u201d. He said it there was optimism that all remaining fires in the state would remain at a contained status by the end of the week. It was possible all of them could be extinguished. \u201cIt would be an absolute miracle. We hope so,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly all contained. We\u2019re hopeful to get to the stage where we can call them out.\u201d Firefighters have faced an unprecedented season and have been battling blazes since July last year. On Monday, the RFS said some of the biggest fires were now extinguished. They include the Gospers Mountain fire in the Hawkesbury, the Currowan fire in the Shoalhaven, the Green Wattle Creek fire in Wollondilly, the Myall Creek Road fire (Richmond Valley), the Erskine Creek fire (Blue Mountains), the Kerry Ridge fire (Muswellbrook) and the Morton fire (Wingecarribee). The spokesman said there would still be some work for remote area crews to extinguish smaller materials such as smouldering tree stumps and logs in some locations. He said the significant rainfall was likely to lead to more benign conditions for the remainder of the season, but stressed there were still months to go. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years, we\u2019ve still had bushfires threaten homes in March and April,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know all it takes is a couple of weeks of warm and windy conditions.\u201d The wild weather triggered widespread chaos over the weekend. On Monday afternoon, Ausgrid was continuing to deal with 3,100 hazards, including fallen powerlines, fallen trees, damaged wires and extensive flash flooding. The company had restored power to 61,000 customers and was continuing efforts to reconnect 79,000 still without power. The Bureau of Meteorology issued warnings for abnormally high tides for most of the NSW coast on Monday evening and severe thunderstorm warnings were in place for the northern rivers region and parts of the mid-north coast. Some parts of the state have had up to 700mm of rainfall since Wednesday including Robertson, in the southern highlands, which saw 698mm of rain \u2013 500mm of which was across the weekend alone. Pottsville, in the northern rivers region, was battered with close to 605mm of rain, while the central tablelands copped 631mm since Wednesday. The BoM said floods around Sydney over the weekend and into Monday were the most significant that had been seen in about 30 years. Warragamba dam\u2019s storage levels had reached 60.7% on Monday, up 17.7% on the previous week. This time last year, the dam\u2019s storage levels were sitting at 61.4%. In a statement on Sunday, WaterNSW said ash and debris generated by recent bushfires around the Warragamba area would not affect water quality. Two silt curtains are in place to intercept ash run-off. \u201cWhile it is likely some ash and debris has been washed into the upper reaches of the Warragamba system, there is no impact on the water quality being supplied for treatment. Any surface debris is being avoided by extracting water from 30m below the surface as a precaution,\u201d the statement said.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI dedicate this to all the Indigenous kids all over the world who want to do art and dance and write stories,\u201d said Taika Waititi, the New Zealand filmmaker of the Nazi-era satire Jojo Rabbit, as he accepted his Oscar at Monday\u2019s ceremony. \u201cWe are the original storytellers and we can make it here as well.\u201d Waititi had just become the first M\u0101ori filmmaker to win an adapted screenplay Oscar, for Jojo Rabbit, which he adapted from the 2008 novel Caging Skies. Waititi also directed the film and starred in it as a bumbling, comedic Adolf Hitler. Jojo Rabbit tells the story of a 10-year-old German boy named Jojo, a member of the Hitler youth whose imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler himself, who discovers that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in the family\u2019s home. A beaming Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, began her weekly press conference by congratulating Waititi. \u201cI know we\u2019re all incredibly proud of him,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see many movies but I\u2019ve seen that one, and not many people could pull off an amazing film like that.\u201d Christine Leunens, the author of the novel that Waititi adapted, told the Guardian after the ceremony that those behind the film were \u201cabout to have a well-needed drink.\u201d \u201cI feel that Taika took the message of the story and he put notes of hope and humour to bring it to a contemporary audience, offering a message that the story has become relevant again today,\u201d she said of the filmmaker\u2019s interpretation of her \u201ccareful\u201d historical novel. Leunens said the film showed moviegoers that \u201cwe have a choice, are we going to go back to this kind of thinking ... superior, inferior ... or are we going to move on and bring more love and compassion to our relationships?\u201d She had scrutinised Waititi\u2019s work when she had learned that he wanted to option the rights for the film. \u201cThere was something very distinctive, tragedy and humour,\u201d she said. \u201cLiving in New Zealand, I find that the M\u0101ori have such a wonderful sense of humour, and such warmth and such inclusivity.\u201d Ella Henry, a commentator on the M\u0101ori screen industry based at Auckland University of Technology, said although the tale was not on its face an Indigenous one, Waititi had told it in a way that was in keeping with M\u0101ori storytelling traditions. \u201cIf you look at the way Taika\u2019s films have evolved to use humour and pathos to express trauma, he elevates survival by bringing that pathos and humour and resilience to those stories,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I would say it\u2019s a very M\u0101ori story.\u201d Jojo Rabbit was also nominated for the Academy Awards\u2019 prestigious best picture category; the film also received nods for best adapted screenplay, film editing, costume design, production design and best supporting actress for Scarlett Johansson, who plays Jojo\u2019s mother. Henry said Waititi was bringing attention to M\u0101ori creators \u2013 but he was more than just a visible figure in the film industry. \u201cHe brought his Indigenous sensibilities to it by asking producers to ensure there were Indigenous trainees in every department,\u201d she said of Waiti\u2019s work directing the Marvel film Thor: Ragnarok. In 2005, Waititi received his first Oscar nomination for the short film Two Cars, One Night.",

And under the model, that\u2019s partners would build and operate the platform. </p> <p>But this is the important piece ... the government would always retain the responsibility, as they do today, for all visa decision-making. </p> <p>It would determine the business rules and how decisions are made. It would remain responsible for national security and other risk assessments, and it would be overall responsible, on an ongoing basis, for visa policy. </p> <p>In this regard, this model is actually very similar to the model which we already have in place called the Electronic Travel Authority, upon which about 30% of all visas are processed, and that model itself was in place all throughout the Labor years, which did not change. </p> <p>It was precisely that model whereby there was a partner which assists in the visa processing, but the government remains at all times responsible for the business rules, for the risk assessment, for the policy, and for all of the major decisions. <strong>Now, Mr Speaker, the process for selecting the partners here has not been completed yet. There is still a process which is under way, but I repeat that we do need to upgrade our visa processing systems at some stage soon, given the age of those systems and given how many visas we are getting every single year, and that\u2019s just increasing</strong>.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-10T04:42:03.462Z\">at 4.42am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e40db4e8f0811db2faf4a37\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-10T04:30:48.158Z\">4.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mark Butler </strong>to<strong> Scott Morrison:<br></strong></p> <p>Does the prime minister support providing $300 million of taxpayer funds to keep the Liddell power station open only for three more years, even though a leaked taskforce report says such an extension would not provide any guarantee of reliability, and defer private investment in new generation?</p> <p><strong>Angus Taylor</strong> gets the nod:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m awaiting the final report of the Liddell taskforce.

This is all about adding in more supply to the electricity market whilst we ensure that the existing supply is managed very carefully. </p> <p>And we are seeing results. We have now seen four consecutive quarters in reduction in retail electricity prices, for the first time in recorded history.</p> <p>... As I was saying, four consecutive quarters of electricity price reductions in the CPI, 3.5% reduction. </p> <p>We have also seen that in the last three months, Mr Speaker, compared to the same period last year, we\u2019ve seen 35% reductions in wholesale electricity prices in the national electricity market, 35% reductions.

Why aren\u2019t these businesses eligible for grants, only loans, that are going to push them further into debt?</p> <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can update the House. In New South Wales 172 applications have been made for those small business grants. 46 have been paid out, worth over $600,000. </p> <p>As the member may recall, because I advised of him this last week, through an answer to a question from another member, the grant applications are assessed by the New South Wales state government and managed by them. </p> <p>They make the payments and we reimburse those payments and that has been the arrangement under this government, under the previous government. And when it comes to the guidelines they develop for assessing whether grants are provided in circumstances like this, we have not departed from the previous practice that we inherited, which was all about damage to those businesses. </p> <p>That damage could include things like power being cut off, and things of that nature. </p> <p>What we have done is, those businesses that may have only had \u2013 I don\u2019t mean may, because it\u2019s significant \u2013 those businesses which had a loss of income as a result of the loss of tourist trade, what we provided to them through this category D assistance is loans, zero interest, nothing to pay for two years, and then at concessional rates, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to those businesses should they seek to take those up. </p> <p>They\u2019re the same arrangements that have been put in place for previous disasters. </p> <p>I think it\u2019s important, because I was in Townsville on Friday, where we had floods a year ago. </p> <p>And we\u2019re still rebuilding from those floods. And I think it\u2019s important that we provide the same assistance to those who are in north Queensland at that time, as we are today. </p> <p>And we\u2019re ensuring a consistency in our approach, and that was the consistency that had been established.

Like <strong>Jim Molan </strong>didn\u2019t just go on national TV and question it. Like <strong>Craig Kelly </strong>didn\u2019t straight out deny it on international TV. Like the Nationals aren\u2019t threatening to blow up the whole show over it.

That\u2019s not been in dispute by our government.</p> <p>It\u2019s not in dispute by our government.

Now they can deny the facts if they like, but they are the facts. What I\u2019ve also said in response to this dreadful black summer that we have been experiencing is that taking action on climate change isn\u2019t just about taking action on emissions. </p> <p>It\u2019s about taking action on climate resilience. It\u2019s about taking action on climate adaptation. It\u2019s about taking action on hazard reduction, which is a form of climate resilience. It\u2019s about building dams like, Mr Speaker, the billions of dollars we\u2019re investing in those projects through the national water grid. Building dams is climate action now. I note the leader of the Greens doesn\u2019t agree with that. He\u2019s entitled not to agree with that. But the science suggests it is.

Leaders reaffirmed the benefits of open markets and inclusive regional economic integration. Leaders committed to working constructively together through the G20, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) and other regional and multilateral fora to support the multilateral trading system and take forward WTO reform. Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and will work together to finalise all outstanding negotiations ahead of signature in 2020, completing an agreement which builds on the Asean-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA) and which complements IA-CEPA.</p> <p>10. Through our longstanding economic partnership for development, leaders agreed to cooperate to encourage sustainable and inclusive economic growth and stability; address poverty and inequality; strengthen human capital, education and skills; promote women\u2019s leadership and empowerment; and support disability inclusion.</p> <p>11. Given how close eastern Indonesia and northern Australia are, leaders agreed to explore ways to further boost economic cooperation and connectivity, including through better transportation links.</p> <p>12.

that might broadly lead our region. </p> <p><strong>Monash University will establish its first foreign campus in Indonesia under this agreement,</strong> and that is an indication of how this is a two-way street. </p> <p>Not only that, but the treasurer today reinforced the opportunity for Australian pension funds, superannuation funds, to be looking at the opportunities that exist in Indonesia, as they do in many other countries around the world, and we see that investment partnership is a key part of how the agreement will be realised. </p> <p>On the issues of strategic security in our region, Indonesia is a leader and wonderful partner to Australia, whether it is on maritime cooperation or working together with international peacekeeping, which we will now be seeking to do. </p> <p><strong>This is just a further layer in what is already a very, very deep relationship, and when it comes to the South China Sea, we share our commitment to sovereignty, stability and respect for the rule of international law</strong>. </p> <p>We have also discussed today ... challenges around counterterrorism, countering foreign fighters and influence. </p> <p>These are issues in which we are sharing expertise under view of the world. </p> <p>Finally, we have the opportunity to talk through issues of the coronavirus and the measures we are taking in concert and the information we are sharing to contain the impact of the coronavirus in Indonesia and Australia, and we will continue to work closely with our medical advisors and the other arrangements we have to ensure we can both effectively carry out our responsibilities to our peoples to keep the health and well-being of our peoples in the highest possible order. </p> <p>As you can see, it\u2019s been a very wide-ranging

      "bodyText": "On that note, we are going to, as Murph would say, land the plane and close the blog for the night. We\u2019ll be back early tomorrow morning, when all the parties meet to discuss policy, strategy, and, if you are the Nationals, how to stay together. Llew O\u2019Brien will have had his chat to the prime minister by then. He\u2019ll be in joint party room, but not the Nationals party room. Which again, is not a punishment. It does rob him of the chance to do something about the leadership, which is the reason he left the party in the first place, but it doesn\u2019t do anything else in terms of government numbers. It just reinforces how divided the Nats still are. Although, I would pay good money to see Damian Drum\u2019s reaction in the party room tomorrow. The man isn\u2019t exactly known for being a wallflower. Plus, Ken O\u2019Dowd has probably done himself out of the deputy whip position, given he admitted on national television that he had voted against the party line, despite his job being to keep everyone toeing the party line. I haven\u2019t had this many giggles since my dad fell into a pond at my wedding while singing the Banana Boat Day-O song and lost his car keys. Thank you to everyone who joined us today. We will be back early tomorrow. You can catch me on Twitter or Instagram in the meantime. Mike Bowers, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy will all be back as well, along with the rest of the Guardian brains trust. Thanks again \u2013 and take care of you. So, in conclusion, the Nationals leader\u2019s pick for the deputy speaker position was gazumped by a Labor troll, after the rogue Nats\u2019 plan to fleece Michael McCormack, led by Barnaby Joyce, and put Ken O\u2019Dowd in place of Damian Drum was scuttled. What does it mean? Nothing other than the man who has led the charge against McCormack, Llew O\u2019Brien, gets a pay rise, and McCormack has once again, and quite publicly, had his authority over his party shot to pieces. And that last bit is what is going to cost him long term. As sincere as a Kardashian therapy session: \u201cSam, the first night at BED when you left, Rob...\u201d The Greens also have a production of documents order on this report \u2013 which also wants the emails between PMO and Bridget McKenzie. That one is due to be ignored by Thursday. Jacqui Lambie is very, very angry over Mathias Cormann\u2019s use of cabinet-in-confidence to stop the tabling of the PM&amp;C report in the Senate. Lambie says this is why the public can\u2019t trust politicians. \u201cDoes he take us all for morons,\u201d she says, adding that the prime minister doesn\u2019t \u201chave the guts\u201d to table the report. Just a reminder that Llew O\u2019Brien\u2019s salary boost for becoming deputy speaker is worth about three years of Newstart. Apparently Labor\u2019s Julian Hill almost missed casting his ballot because he was taking a photo of it to troll the government, and then forgot it under his iPad. He found it, signalled the clerks, there was a discussion, and then it was counted. Not that it mattered in the end \u2013 75 to 67 is a comprehensive win. Over in the Senate, which shockingly is the sane chamber lately, Mathias Cormann will have to front up to explain why the government won\u2019t be complying with the Senate order to produce the Phil Gaetjen\u2019s report into why the sports grant affair is hunky dory. It was due on Thursday. It was not produced. They\u2019ll call it cabinet-in-confidence, so you won\u2019t get it for 20 years, even though other reports into ministerial conduct have been released. You like me, and I like it all We like dancing and we look divine You love bands when they\u2019re playing hard You want more and you want it fast They put you down, they say I\u2019m wrong Ken O\u2019Dowd is also the Nationals deputy whip. Not sure he can hold on to that position, having just admitted he voted against the party line on national TV. Ken O\u2019Dowd logic: Barnaby is considered in Queensland nearly a Queenslander. I know he was born in New South Wales but he has spent a lot of his life in Queensland. When I first met him he was a senator for Queensland. I still get him sometimes as a Queenslander. I am still laughing. Honestly. At this point, the Nationals couldn\u2019t organise a piss-up in a brewery. Looking at those numbers, it looks like, if we consider the crossbench voting with Labor, another five government MPs came over to the Labor vote. 75 would equal 64 Labor MPs, plus six in the crossbench, plus five government MPs. So Ken O\u2019Dowd is a yes. Barnaby Joyce is most likely a yes. Llew O\u2019Brien is a yes. Who are the other two? Asked by Patricia Karvelas why some in the Nationals are so upset with Michael McCormack: If it wasn\u2019t for central Queensland and the seats around Flynn, we wouldn\u2019t be in government today. I don\u2019t think that has been recognised fully by the National party. We wanted more representation in ... with the Coalition. This is another step forward, as far as I\u2019m concerned. The new deputy leader of the Nationals is a Queenslander. Keith Pitt is now in the cabinet. There are only 21 Nats. I am not sure how much more Queensland representation they want, but hey \u2013 LET\u2019S FIND OUT. Llew O\u2019Brien (thanks to a blog watcher for the transcription): It is a tremendous privilege to be in this place. Every election we put ourselves forward to our constituents to serve them in the most honest and best way we can. I\u2019m privileged to be here. As a country policeman, I find it incredible that I can walk into this place and take part in this. It\u2019s an honour to serve the people of Wide Bay and it will be an honour to serve this House as deputy Speaker. Ken O\u2019Dowd tells Patricia Karvelas that Barnaby Joyce was going to nominate him for deputy speaker, despite the party room vote, but ahead of the vote this afternoon, O\u2019Dowd told him not to, to help with party unity. But then he voted against what the party wanted, because (extreme Billy Moore voice) QUEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNSSSSSSLLLLLLANNNNNDER O\u2019Dowd, who once said he would be willing to step up as deputy prime minister and leader of the Nats if he was called upon (narrator: he was never, and would never, be called upon. There aren\u2019t enough evens to can\u2019t for that to happen) says he thinks Barnaby Joyce should come back as leader of the Nationals, because he still thinks of him as a Queenslander as well. Queensland \u2013 it is the greatest nation on earth. (I can say that, because I grew up there and I am allowed.) Ken O\u2019Dowd is telling Patricia Karvelas he voted for Llew O\u2019Brien over Michael McCormack\u2019s pick. Fortune favours the brave. He was brave enough to call the challenge last week. He followed up with divorcing the National party, which I thought was a pretty bold move. As I just said, fortune favours the brave. But I didn\u2019t support him. PK: What did you say you did support him? So you did support him today. Yes. Why? O\u2019Dowd: Barnaby has made a few points and I was bowled over by Damian and the party room this morning because I stood for the deputy speaker too. I was beaten in a fair ballot. That remains the same. It was good to see that Llew O\u2019Brien, who comes from Queensland, he is only a couple of doors away from where I live and I know he will do a good job. It is good to have one of our own in that position. Happy for him and happy to Queensland. We can\u2019t be all Victoria and NSW. PK: I want to get to the bottom of this. Damian Drum won the nomination but you didn\u2019t vote for the person the Nationals wanted to be the deputy speaker? O\u2019Dowd: It was the party room that wanted Damian as opposed to myself. Then Llew O\u2019Brien was also a Queenslander, LNP, I am LNP, really take my hat off to Llew for making a stand. Fortune favours the brave. He was brave enough to make those steps. He made them. Fully realising the consequences of those steps. Look at that. Came out in front. Good on the underdog. All the Labor MPs are shaking Llew O\u2019Brien\u2019s hand as they leave. Michael McCormack had promised Damian Drum the role following the leadership spill. It is always confirmed by a vote of the parliament, but once again, the Coalition underestimated Labor\u2019s tactical abilities. They are just better at this sort of stuff, because they practice on each other through factional battles. Also, Llew O\u2019Brien just received a $42,000 payrise for quitting the Nationals party room AND got revenge against McCormack. Not a bad day\u2019s work. Michael McCormack\u2019s candidate for (deputy) speaker just got rolled in a house wide vote. I actually can\u2019t stop laughing. This may be his greatest gift to the parliament. Llew O\u2019Brien is on duty at 7pm tonight. So guess he won\u2019t be meeting with the prime minister tonight then. Scott Morrison: Can I congratulate the member. With two government members to choose from I\u2019m pleased to see government members received the full confidence of all the member for the House. The member and his experience that he brings to this House \u2013 I more than most have an understanding of what he brings to this House, as I do also understand what the member for Nichols brings to this House, Mr Speaker. There is no shortage of government members in this House to make sure that we continue to deliver on the promises we made the Australian people, Mr Speaker. These government members will continue to make sure that a strong economy saves Australia, and a government that will continue to meet the needs of the Australian people will be delivered on each and every day that this government majority serves in this House. Anthony Albanese: No amount of marketing or spin can hide the humiliation for the government. I congratulate the member for Wide Bay on receiving such strong support from his colleagues in the House of Representatives. I asked the question earlier today, the first question of Question Time, to the stability of the government. We have just seen the stability of the Coalition on all of you. On full view. For everyone to see, government members running against each other, for a position of deputy speaker of the House of Representatives. Albanese moves on to congratulate O\u2019Brien. Michael McCormack: \u201cI congratulate the member and I know he\u2019ll do a good job ... that\u2019s democracy.\u201d Tony Smith is attempting to work out if Llew O\u2019Brien still counts as a member of the government. He hasn\u2019t read the O\u2019Brien stories today. I have clearly stated that I am still a member of the government, I do not sit as a National party member, I sit as a member of the LNP, which is what I put forward to the people of Wide Bay,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. So there you go. It is official. Michael McCormack looks like he has just read this blog. Scott Morrison is congratulating McCormack. \u201cThere is no shortage of government members in this House to ensure that we continue to deliver for the people of Australia,\u201d Morrison says, pointing out that two government MPs were up for election. Anthony Albanese says \u201cno amount of marketing and spin can hide the humiliation from that vote\u201d and then congratulates Llew O\u2019Brien on his comprehensive win. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Llew O\u2019Brien is the new deputy speaker. The votes have been counted Damian Drum: 67 Llew O\u2019Brien: 75 George Christensen has put up a new statement on Facebook, in response to his \u201cinner city Liberal\u201d criticism earlier this morning. I will always stand up for local workers, local businesses, local farmers and local industry, no matter if it\u2019s the Greens, Labor or my own side trying to talk down our opportunity to prosper with new affordable and reliable clean coal-fired power. This is presented with the caveat that there is a very, very low bar for excitement in this place. Australian variety TV low Sorry, as corrected by Paul Karp \u2013 if the crossbench votes with Labor, then you only need two from the government. One would think that Llew O\u2019Brien would vote for himself, so that would mean one more vote for O\u2019Brien. As seen by Mike Bowers: Barnaby saw a Llew: The crossbench saw one too: It\u2019s a secret ballot. For Labor\u2019s troll to work here (one Llew O\u2019Brien has very enthusiastically picked up) the crossbench would have to vote with Labor, along with three government MPs. Not impossible, but also not likely. Still. Stranger things have happened in this place. Llew O\u2019Brien has accepted the nomination, formally. This is almost as great as Parasite winning best picture. Excellent news The deputy speaker role comes with an additional 20% of the base wage, which is $211,250 a year. That\u2019s an extra $42,000 or so. Tony Smith is dealing with practice issues \u2013 usually the nominees for deputy speaker have to accept the nomination. Llew O\u2019Brien isn\u2019t in the chamber, so Smith is trying to work out if he accepts Labor\u2019s nomination. The nominee doesn\u2019t have to be present at the election, or inform the House of whether or not they accept the nomination \u2013 but Smith will ask if he makes it to the House for the vote. Tony Burke is now trolling the government by nominating Llew O\u2019Brien for the role. Damian Drum will be the new deputy speaker. It\u2019s kinda cute that the parliament is pretending that this is a proper election and not something that was stitched up in the joint party room. The folders were stacked \u2013 and now question time is over. Anthony Albanese to Alan Tudge: My question is addressed to the acting minister for immigration, and it goes to his last answer where he ignored the $165,000 donation from a private company, which seeks to, to quote him, \u201cbuild and operate the visa system\u201d. I say to the minister: If it looks like a privatisation and smells like a privatisation, why won\u2019t the minister concede that this is privatisation of our visa system by a major donor and mate of the prime minister? Christian Porter attempts to stop the question, but Tony Smith rules it in order: Tudge: I can only just reiterate that it is not a privatisation because the government will remain responsible for all of the key national security decisions, the risk assessment, the visa policy, the business rules and all of the key functions of government. In that regard, this model, which we have been going through an expression of interest process through, is precisely the same as the Electronic Travel Authority, upon which, when Labor was in government for those six, long years, they ran and they were quite happy with that process under way. And 30% of all visas today go through the Electronic Visa Authority. So, clearly, the Labor party did not have a great problem with that model when they were in government but now today they are seeking to politicise this system. They didn\u2019t make the decision to upgrade the visa processing system because they didn\u2019t have the money to do so. We\u2019ve made the decision to do so, and we will go through it in a methodical, professional way, doing the things that governments should be doing. Andrew Giles to Scott Morrison: Does the Prime Minister plan to proceed with the privatisation of Australia\u2019s visa system in light of revelations that his mate, Scott Briggs, spent last year leading a group trying to buy the visa group while spending $165,000 to the Liberal party? Alan Tudge gets this one: Let me point out that we are not privatising the visa system \u2013 far from it. Rather, several years ago we decided that we needed to upgrade our visa processing capabilities ... because the visa processing capabilities are about 25 years old and unable to do some of the modern functionality which we would like. Furthermore, given the growth in the visa applications, are projected by a further 35% over the next 10 years to 13 million visa applications each year, it is clearly timely to be examining whether or not to upgrade the visa processing system. So we\u2019ve actually been out to the market to see who would partner with the government to build the new capability. And under the model, that\u2019s partners would build and operate the platform. But this is the important piece ... the government would always retain the responsibility, as they do today, for all visa decision-making. It would determine the business rules and how decisions are made. It would remain responsible for national security and other risk assessments, and it would be overall responsible, on an ongoing basis, for visa policy. In this regard, this model is actually very similar to the model which we already have in place called the Electronic Travel Authority, upon which about 30% of all visas are processed, and that model itself was in place all throughout the Labor years, which did not change. It was precisely that model whereby there was a partner which assists in the visa processing, but the government remains at all times responsible for the business rules, for the risk assessment, for the policy, and for all of the major decisions. Now, Mr Speaker, the process for selecting the partners here has not been completed yet. There is still a process which is under way, but I repeat that we do need to upgrade our visa processing systems at some stage soon, given the age of those systems and given how many visas we are getting every single year, and that\u2019s just increasing. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister support providing $300 million of taxpayer funds to keep the Liddell power station open only for three more years, even though a leaked taskforce report says such an extension would not provide any guarantee of reliability, and defer private investment in new generation? Angus Taylor gets the nod: I\u2019m awaiting the final report of the Liddell taskforce. I won\u2019t pre-empt the outcome of that report. Once we received that report, once we have received it, we\u2019ll consider its recommendation. But we\u2019ve been clear all the way along. And as generators come to the end of their natural lives. We want to see life extension or like for like replacement. This is all about replacement. This is all about adding in more supply to the electricity market whilst we ensure that the existing supply is managed very carefully. And we are seeing results. We have now seen four consecutive quarters in reduction in retail electricity prices, for the first time in recorded history. ... As I was saying, four consecutive quarters of electricity price reductions in the CPI, 3.5% reduction. We have also seen that in the last three months, Mr Speaker, compared to the same period last year, we\u2019ve seen 35% reductions in wholesale electricity prices in the national electricity market, 35% reductions. Queensland, 30%. South Australia, 50%. Victoria 38%. Tasmania, 32%, and Queensland 4%, to an average of 35%. And we will ensure, we will work with the energy companies to make sure this is passed through to electricity consumers because the big stick legislation ensures the substantial and sustained savings, and reductions in costs must be passed through to consumers, and we are achieving all of this while we meet and beat our Kyoto Paris targets. And why are we seeing reductions in energy prices? Could it be that a buttload (the official measurement) of renewables have come onto the grid? Could it? The answer, dear readers, is yes. It is. Peter Dutton is back with just how safe are you, Australia: Indonesia cooperation edition. You are as safe as the government can make you, kittens. Which is much, much safer than anyone could ever have made you, ever. Fiona Phillips to Scott Morrison: A local business in my electorate, Rob\u2019s Bait and Tackle, has lost 80% of their income for the year as a direct result of the fires. This small family business and many others are reluctant to pile on debt at a time when they have very little income. Will the government provide grants for businesses like this, instead of loans that increase their debt? Morrison: That is is a devastating loss of income for that business. I would be very pleased if you can pass on their details. I make them available to the head of the national bushfire recovery agency and see what measures, additional measures, they may not be able to be aware of, to assist them specifically to their circumstances. A range of questions put forward by the opposition today that are seeking a change to the assessment for these grants. I note that\u2019s what you\u2019re suggesting. There should be a change. I would invite the leader of the opposition to write to me and set out the changes to the grant guidelines that he is proposing, Mr Speaker. And I will happily have those assessed by the Department of Finance and I\u2019ll be able to advise the House about the outcome and we can assess the feasibility of the proposal they are making. I invite them to put that proposal in writing to us. Either there is a new spirit of bipartisanship in the chamber, or the prime minister just asked the opposition to come up with policy for him. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Last Friday on the south coast of New South Wales, I was told about the collapse in tourism income over the peak earning period for small businesses. Has the prime minister received the same response that we heard firsthand, that his government\u2019s marketing campaign is not cutting through? Josh Frydenberg gets the nod: I find it amusing coming from the shadow minister, a question about small business, when 62,000 closed their doors in their last year in office, Mr Speaker. 62,000 and over the last year, 75,000. [Labor\u2019s final year in office was the global financial crisis]. Now the reality is that small businesses will have access to half a million dollars in working capital, Mr Speaker, as the prime minister said, two years interest free, and then the interest rate will be half the 10-year commonwealth bond rate, Mr Speaker. Half the 10-year commonwealth bond rate. The reality is that small businesses have been damaged by the fires will get grants up to $50,000 and we\u2019re working through the states. Primary industries. ... $76 million we have announced for tourism to help create jobs in the tourism sector and deal with what has been a [devastated] sector, by not only the ongoing drought, but these devastating bushfires. We have announced a significant package of measures to small business, and over the last reported year, we have seen 75,000 small businesses created. Our focus is on helping the tourism sector get back on its feet. It is really, really rare that Barnaby Joyce actually speaks for the nation Labor\u2019s second set of questions is about the female facilities and water safety stream program, which gave $150m with no guidelines on eligibility. Labor highlights that Scott Morrison had promised \u201cfurther details\u201d on the program which never materialised. Sport minister Richard Colbeck first defends the OG sports rorts fund \u2013 the community sports infrastructure grant program \u2013 by noting it was oversubscribed. Colbeck then moved on to female facilities and water safety \u2013 noting the health department is using standard CDG (capital development guidelines) \u201cto deliver grants that were subject of election promises\u201d. He said that Labor had committed $250m to sports facilities. The general point is: there didn\u2019t need to be any application process, because the government had already cherry-picked which projects were going to get money if they won. Honestly, looking for sense in a Michael McCormack answer is as useless as searching for meaning in a Diplo song. Michael McCormack appears to be malfunctioning in answer to a Terri Butler question about building dams. He seems only able to say \u201cgetting on with the jobs\u201d and \u201cdams\u201d and other words, which, if you squint, may approximate a sentence. But there is a bit of Blu Tack on the roof, which suddenly seems exceptionally interesting. White bread: Those opposite, Mr Speaker, when they were in power, they just wanted to take water away from our irrigators. We want to give them more water. We do that by capturing water when it falls. We had a lot of it just this weekend. We want to make sure that when water falls, whether it\u2019s in the north, wherever it is in the country, we can capture it, we can store it, we can harness it, we can harvest it for when it is dry. And even, I\u2019m sure, the Greens leader, the former ALP branch member, Mr Speaker, he\u2019ll understand that too. He\u2019ll understand that too. There\u2019s nobody more committed to building dams than, Mr Speaker, our regional members on this side of the house. Because we understand the great economic capacity it will be for our nation, the great economic boost it will be for our regional areas, and we\u2019ll get on with the job. We are getting on with the job. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Last Thursday night, while visiting bushfire-affected communities on the south coast of New South Wales, I met a truck driver in Nelligen, who is losing income because of the fires but isn\u2019t eligible for any assistance under the government\u2019s recovery package. Can the prime minister tell the house why thousands of workers who lost income because of the fires can\u2019t get a helping hand from this government? Morrison: As the member would recall, when he was in a government managing disasters, that he would know there are many other payments, whether it\u2019s in the welfare system, whether it is in the Newstart program, or many other measures available to provide income support for those who found themselves in difficulty. That\u2019s the whole point of the safety net that has been built. I tell you how you can keep a safety net in place. You keep it in place by ensuring you manage money well, you actually can bring a budget back into balance and do it without adding levies, as those opposite had to do when they were struck by disasters, Mr Speaker. They had to go out and tax Australians more because they couldn\u2019t manage money. We are delivering $2 billion of additional support in initial and addition support through the national bushfire recovery agency. We\u2019re working through the disaster recovery payment arrangements we put in place about the states and territories. We\u2019re doing that consistent with all the same guidelines and rules put in place by the previous government, and those rules and guidelines did serve their government well, and I believe they serve our government well. Mr Speaker, I will take the interjection. Because he said I was just criticising those arrangements. I was not criticising those arrangements. His own member who asked the question previously of me was criticising the very arrangements that the government is putting in place now. Now, Mr Speaker, we will continue to work with the state and territory governments, we\u2019ll continue to work with local councils, we\u2019ll continue to work with businesses right across the country through local economic recovery plans now being put in place by the states with the commonwealth working with the former commissioner Colvin, who heads up the national bushfire recovery agency. What we\u2019ll stay focused on is rebuilding this economy in those areas that have been so devastated by the bushfires, that will happen with the rebuilding work we\u2019re putting in place. Listen carefully to those communities, whether it\u2019s the orchardists out there in Batlow or those in the forestry industry, or the defence force we sent in who rebuilt the roof on Mogo zoo, and cleared out the Eden mill so they can get their operation back on track. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do each and every day. We won\u2019t play politics with bushfires in this place. Michael McCormack is summoned to the despatch box, and says something about it being an eventful month, and then seems surprised that there is laughter in response. Me too \u2013 it proves that there are still people in there listening to him. He meant trade, but because he has the self awareness of a YouTube star making an apology, he apparently doesn\u2019t get how a week out of a ridiculous leadership spill that continues to have ramifications for the government, \u201cbit of an eventful week\u201d is probably the closest he has come to having a personality. Stephen Jones to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. It\u2019s also about business, because last Friday, while on the south coast of New South Wales, I was told about businesses which did not burn down but had taken a huge hit to income because of the bushfires. Why aren\u2019t these businesses eligible for grants, only loans, that are going to push them further into debt? Morrison: I can update the House. In New South Wales 172 applications have been made for those small business grants. 46 have been paid out, worth over $600,000. As the member may recall, because I advised of him this last week, through an answer to a question from another member, the grant applications are assessed by the New South Wales state government and managed by them. They make the payments and we reimburse those payments and that has been the arrangement under this government, under the previous government. And when it comes to the guidelines they develop for assessing whether grants are provided in circumstances like this, we have not departed from the previous practice that we inherited, which was all about damage to those businesses. That damage could include things like power being cut off, and things of that nature. What we have done is, those businesses that may have only had \u2013 I don\u2019t mean may, because it\u2019s significant \u2013 those businesses which had a loss of income as a result of the loss of tourist trade, what we provided to them through this category D assistance is loans, zero interest, nothing to pay for two years, and then at concessional rates, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to those businesses should they seek to take those up. They\u2019re the same arrangements that have been put in place for previous disasters. I think it\u2019s important, because I was in Townsville on Friday, where we had floods a year ago. And we\u2019re still rebuilding from those floods. And I think it\u2019s important that we provide the same assistance to those who are in north Queensland at that time, as we are today. And we\u2019re ensuring a consistency in our approach, and that was the consistency that had been established. And I see you shake your head. If you\u2019re saying it should be different, why didn\u2019t the Labor party change it when you were in government, we\u2019re using your rules. Oh golly gee, I don\u2019t know Mr prime minister. Maybe it\u2019s because disasters seem to have changed a bit in the past six years since the Coalition has been in power and we are seeing worse disasters more often? Maybe it\u2019s something the actual government could look at changing? Really excited to see how hazard reduction burns will help stop floods. Right after we get onto all those arsonists who started them, and the Greens policies which didn\u2019t let us burn the rain ahead of the monsoon season. Really loving the re-writing of the climate narrative Scott Morrison is bringing into parliament lately. It is almost as if the summer has wounded him, and he\u2019s now attempting to pretend that there is no question in his government climate change is causing impacts. Like Jim Molan didn\u2019t just go on national TV and question it. Like Craig Kelly didn\u2019t straight out deny it on international TV. Like the Nationals aren\u2019t threatening to blow up the whole show over it. But then again, \u201cclimate action now\u201d apparently means dams and hazard reduction burns and adding exclamation marks to things, so I guess the bar is very, very low these days. Adam Bandt: Australia is in record drought, catastrophic megafires have burnt our country, our capital cities have ranked amongst the world\u2019s most polluted and now we\u2019re facing a flood disaster. Do you now accept we\u2019re facing a coal-fuelled climate emergency? Morrison: As I advised the House last week, the royal commission that the government will be moving forward on, once I receive feedback from the states and the territories, on the terms of reference for that royal commission, and at that time, I will then forward a copy of that to the opposition before announcing what we intend to do with that royal commission. It starts from the premise that we\u2019re dealing with longer, hotter, drier summers and we have always, and I have always acknowledged the link between the climate change and these broader weather climatic events. That\u2019s not been in dispute by our government. It\u2019s not in dispute by our government. Those on the opposite [side]... they laugh and giggle and smirk, because they\u2019re seeking to put forward a false conflict in this place. Our government is taking action to reduce emissions and they have fallen by 12. 8%. Mr Speaker, our government has put in place policies that has led to one of the highest levels of renewable investments this country has ever seen. Now they can deny the facts if they like, but they are the facts. What I\u2019ve also said in response to this dreadful black summer that we have been experiencing is that taking action on climate change isn\u2019t just about taking action on emissions. It\u2019s about taking action on climate resilience. It\u2019s about taking action on climate adaptation. It\u2019s about taking action on hazard reduction, which is a form of climate resilience. It\u2019s about building dams like, Mr Speaker, the billions of dollars we\u2019re investing in those projects through the national water grid. Building dams is climate action now. I note the leader of the Greens doesn\u2019t agree with that. He\u2019s entitled not to agree with that. But the science suggests it is. And our government will act on that. You may want to ... select and choose those bits you want to listen to, make climate change about being anti-capitalism, that\u2019s not what we think. We think that capitalism and technology is the way you ensure a brighter future for this world and this country. In its first set of Senate questions, Labor targeted new Nationals deputy David Littleproud saying he doesn\u2019t know if climate change is manmade (he has since recanted) and Liberal senator Jim Molan saying he has an open mind on the question. The government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, replied that the government is \u201ccommitted to taking effective action on climate change\u201d, then filibustered, leading Penny Wong and others to interject \u201cWHAT CAUSES IT?\u201d. Eventually, on the third question \u201cdoes the Morrison government accept climate changed is human-induced?\u201d, Cormann gives a simple answer: \u201cYes.\u201d Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: Will the government agree to Labor\u2019s proposal to extend Medicare rule incentives to bushfire-affected areas and work with states to provide counselling for kids in affected schools? Morrison: The member would be aware of the mental health package and the other support measures that have been directed to support students in schools in bushfire-affected areas. And that has been part of the response of the government through the national bushfire recovery agency. I have also had very good discussions, with the New South Wales premier in particular, about the measures they are also developing and delivering in the bushfire-affected areas, and the same has been true of the programs put in place by the Victorian government and [I am] working with the Victorian premier. \u2026 there are so many upsetting and devastating impacts of these recent fires, but the impact on the mental health and wellbeing of children, those who may not have lived in the bushfire-affected areas but have travelled to those areas and have seen things they have never seen before, and the trauma it could have caused is something very much in foremost in the minds of the government and the actions of the national bushfire recovery agency. We have made commitments in that area and we\u2019ll be assessing carefully about what else needs to be done. Keith Pitt gets his first question as a minister from Terri Butler: Does the minister support the development of a domestic nuclear power industry fuelled by Australian resources and cooled by our scarce water reserves? Pitt starts by attempting to be clever, having prepared for this very question (Labor\u2019s first press release on Pitt\u2019s ascension was on this very topic and there have been many, many tweets) but the question is worded simply enough that he gets a \u201cback on the topic please\u201d ruling from the Speaker. As the honourable member knows, there\u2019s already a nuclear industry in Australia, it\u2019s at Lucas Heights. We have a nuclear reactor in Australia producing very important medical technology for all Australians. Those opposite should do their research. I was a supplementary member [of the committee]. I couldn\u2019t even vote on the report ... Cue Speaker warning. Pitt: Noted, Mr Speaker. Tony Smith: That\u2019s a ruling. You can note it, and act on it is the most important thing. Pitt: As I will. The opposition knows the government\u2019s position. There\u2019s a moratorium on nuclear energy in this country. I was a member of the backbench committee that made recommendations. The government will respond to the recommendations in due course. In a dixer, Scott Morrison seems to say that the government can\u2019t guarantee it will be organising any more flights out of coronavirus impacted areas: There can be no guarantee the Australian government are in a position to operate further flights into these affected areas. We said we would prioritise isolated and vulnerable Australians and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done and we thank the Chinese government for their co-operation in assisting us to be able to assist the departure of those Australians from those areas. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: I ask, how can the prime minister claim to lead a stable government when, on the day set aside to pay respect to victims of the bushfires, the Nationals decided to have a leadership challenge, and today a National party member quit, threatening the government\u2019s control of the House. When Australia needs stable government, why do we have a coalition of chaos? Morrison: The leader of the opposition does not represent the situation in the government at all. Not at all. Mr Speaker, our government ... Here are all of our members, and the member for Wide Bay is up the top there, he\u2019s doing a great job. As all the members are representing all of their constituents, and I tell you what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re doing what they promised the Australian people they would do, Mr Speaker. They said, when they went to their electorates, they were part of a government that was going to keep the economy strong, keep Australians safe, and keep Australians together, Mr Speaker. And what we\u2019ve done since that election, we\u2019ve been delivering on the commitments we took to the Australian people. Delivering tax cuts, Mr Speaker, getting on with the job of delivering our climate solutions fund, getting on with the job of keeping Australians safe, and in the face of some of the biggest disasters we\u2019ve seen, Mr Speaker, ensuring that the response, the establishment of the national bushfire recovery agency, the stand-up of the first compulsory call-out of the reserves in response to a bushfire crisis, Mr Speaker, the implementation of our packages to support drought-affected farmers, the stand-up of our arrangements in terms of counter-terrorism, and ensuring that we\u2019re doing the right thing in terms of foreign interference and the impact, Mr Speaker, of foreign terrorist fighters. Our government is keeping Australians safe and we\u2019re respecting our veterans with the measures we announced last week, and we\u2019re getting on with the job what if we promised the Australian people. $100 million in additional infrastructure investments, not only building the roads, but the rail connections this country needs, both now and into the future. We\u2019re delivering on what we told the Australian people we would do. What do we have from those opposite? Each way. They\u2019re for tax cuts, they\u2019re against tax cuts, they are for the drought fund, they\u2019re against the drought fund. The bells are ringing for the resumption of parliament. [cont from previous post] Veronica Koman, an Indonesian human rights lawyer and advocate for West Papua, currently living in exile in Australia, said it was incumbent on Australia, as a neighbour and friend of Indonesia, to raise the issue of West Papua with the visiting president. She said 56 indigenous West Papuans and one Indonesian advocate were currently in prisons across Indonesia charged with treason and facing the potential of life imprisonment for protesting against Indonesian rule over Papua. \u201cThese people were arrested when expressing their opinion during mass protests against racism and for an independence referendum in August and September 2019 and during commemoration of West Papua\u2019s national day on 1 December,\u201d Koman said. \u201cWe demand their immediate and unconditional release.\u201d As many as 45,000 people are displaced from the Nduga regency of Papua following a joint military and police operation there, Koman said. Father Santon Tekege, a priest in the diocese of Timika in West Papua, said the massive and continued military build-up across Nduga and other parts of Papua was \u201cadding to the trauma of fear and anxiety\u201d for West Papuans. \u201cMany indigenous Papuans are starving, many people are displaced in the forests, other community members have been raped or shot dead,\u201d he told the Guardian. The Indonesian government position on West Papua has been resolute for decades. It regards the province as an indivisible part of a unitary Indonesia state, and has consistently rebuffed demands from West Papuans for independence. The Australian government supports Jakarta\u2019s position. Widodo did not mention West Papua in his speech to the Australian parliament. However, a joint statement issued by Widodo and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, \u201creaffirmed [the leaders\u2019] commitment to the Lombok Treaty, signed in 2006, which outlines Indonesia and Australia\u2019s respect for each other\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d. Indonesian president Joko Widodo has been urged to uphold a two-year-old promise to allow United Nations human rights officials free and unfettered access to the restive province of West Papua. Greens leader Adam Bandt met with Widodo following his address to the House of Representatives Monday and told him: \u201cThank you for your speech, thanks for your comments on climate change, now please get something done on West Papua\u201d. Resource-rich but under-developed West Papua has been engaged in a campaign for independence from Indonesia since 1961. The issue flared to acute violence again last year, with mass protests \u2013 and widespread arrests \u2013 across the remote province, sparked by racist abuse of indigenous Papuan students in other parts of Indonesia. A letter from Bandt, and Victorian senator Richard di Natale, presented to the Indonesian president, welcomed his commitment in February 2018 to allow UN human rights officials \u201cimmediate and unfettered access to Papua\u201d. \u201cWe call on you to implement that commitment \u2026 we also welcome your previous statements indicating that you would lift restrictions on access for foreign journalists and human rights monitors, and ask that you expedite this promise. \u201cWe further urge you to order an independent and impartial investigation into all human rights violations related to last year\u2019s protests in Papua, with the aim of bringing the perpetrators of such abuse to justice.\u201d Every time someone says \u201cXX is tearing the Nats apart\u201d I just picture Tommy Wiseau screaming in The Room, and I have to say it makes a lot of things better. Joko Widodo also compared Australia and Indonesia to the good guys in the Marvel universe, using a movie where the main character dies (for the common good) and the good guys only win because they manage to go back in time. The collaboration of the Indonesian-Australia partnership, in the midst of the rising global uncertainties, can be illustrated by the movie \u2018Avengers: Endgame\u2019. When the forces of good unite, the Avengers assemble and the common enemy can be defeated. When Indonesia and Australia continue to collaborate and work together, then intolerance and protectionism and the fear of poverty and the threat of climate change can be overcome. Sarah Martin has heard from Llew O\u2019Brien\u2019s office \u2013 the man of the hour will make a statement after 7pm, when he has spoken to the prime minister. Just stepping outside of parliament for the moment. There are evacuation orders for some Sydney areas \u2026 Just wondering if anyone has asked Peter Dutton yet whether arsonists also lit the floods? Question time won\u2019t be until after 2.30pm. The rest of the parliament has gone quiet while the Joko Widodo formalities play out, so now is a great time to get some lunch, or a mimosa or something. Malcolm Turnbull was stopped in the marble foyer ahead of the reception for Joko Widodo, and was asked about the *latest* energy war in his former party room. The cheapest form of new generation is a combination of renewables plus storage. And there is \u2013 literally, that is no longer a remotely contentious proposition. And these people who are advocating that the government should fund coal-fired power are basically making a case for higher emissions and higher energy prices. And that is nuts. The 15th address from a foreign leader to the parliament (with senators as guests). So nice to see we have moved on from all of this (that was obviously extreme sarcasm). Really enjoying Liberal National party MPs saying they want to see Llew O\u2019Brien \u201cstay in the team\u201d. HE HAS NOT LEFT THE TEAM. He is still an LNP MP. He remains a Morrison government backbencher. He is just not going to sit in the Nationals party room. THAT IS IT. Remember when the leadership spill which ended Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership was supposed to end all the energy fights in the Coalition? The hands have been shaken and the talks had \u2013 Joko Widodo has left the chamber. This is interesting. Joko Widodo: I would like to propose a number of priority agendas as we head into the century of partnership. First, we must continue to advocate the values of democracy and human rights. Stop intolerance, stop xenophobia, stop radicalism and stop terrorism. Identity politics is a trap to democracy. A threat to diversity and a threat to tolerance. These threats will become more actual exploitation for short-term political interests, resulting in hatred, fear and even social conflict. As democratic and diverse countries, we must work hard, side by side together, to defend the values of democracy, tolerance and diversity and to look at the clash of civilisation. Second, Indonesia and Australia must enforce open, free and fair economic principles. Whilst protectionism is rising, we must continue to advocate economic openness and fairness. And the growing popularity of the approach we need to bolster, win-win. I very much believe an open and fair economic system will be beneficial for all. Joko Widodo is pretty strong when it comes to explaining Australia\u2019s relationship with Indonesia: The people of Indonesia will always remember, will always remember, when Indonesia was struck by a tsunami in 2004 in Aceh. Australian soldiers sadly perished while assisting friends in Aceh. They are friends of Indonesia and they are heroes of humanity. The Indonesian president is only the 15th world leader to be given this honour. He opens with a G\u2019day mate, which gets a laugh. The representatives of Australia, the platoon of the Indonesian army engineers, along with personnel of the Indonesian national body for emergency management, have departed Indonesia to New South Wales. They only have one purpose \u2013 to work hand in hand with the Australian people to overcome the bushfire crisis in Australia. And at the same time, teams from Indonesia and Australia are currently discussing possible cooperation for weather modification. On 23 December 2019, I have reaffirmed to Prime Minister Morrison a clear message that Indonesia will always be with Australia during this difficult time. Following the untimely passing of Prime Minister Morrison\u2019s father, [I] had a briefing with the prime minister and his family. True friends are people who stay with you during the good and bad times. A friend in need is a friend indeed. Having a look at the chamber, Adam Bandt has one of the rock star seats behind the main table, right smack bang in front of the lectern where Joko Widodo is making his address. The seat next to him is empty. That seemed a little strange, so we have made some calls. Under the protocol, the seat Bandt is sitting in is reserved for the Greens leader in the Senate, which would be Larissa Waters. So it looks like, as party leader, Bandt has taken that seat. OK The empty chair though, next to his, is reserved for the Nationals leader in the Senate. Which would be Bridget McKenzie. McKenzie is in the chamber \u2013 she is sitting in the benches. I\u2019ll leave it to you to decide why she has not taken her designated seat of honour. I\u2019ve just been reminded of why the parliament doesn\u2019t do these addresses as a joint sitting of the parliament anymore \u2013 it\u2019s because of Bob Brown. In 2003, the then Greens senator interrupted then US president George W Bush as he spoke to the parliament, embarrassing then prime minister John Howard. Greens senator Kerry Nettle was also ejected from the chamber for interrupting. It not only made international news, it also changed parliamentary practices. The House Procedure Committee recommended any future addresses should be carried out as House sittings, with senators invited as guests (which limits their ability to speak, because it makes it easier to boot them out). The practice was adopted and now, senators can as guests, but joint sittings are out. So quite a bit to unpack there. Basically \u2013 trade and investment will grow. The countries are in lockstep on regional security and the South China Sea. There will be more discussions on visa changes between the two countries. And Australia wants to grow the relationship. The statement continues: Contributing to Indo-Pacific Stability and Prosperity 36. With a view to strengthening cooperation in the Indian Ocean, leaders welcomed the elevation of the Indonesia-Australia-India Strategic Dialogue to foreign ministers\u2019 level, with the first meeting to be held as soon as practicable, and looked forward to working closely with India in strengthening the resilience of the Indian Ocean countries, including through the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). 37. Leaders also agreed on the importance of working together in the South Pacific. They welcomed the first iteration of the Indonesia-South Pacific Forum held in March 2019 as well as the Pacific Exposition held in Auckland in July 2019; and looked forward to trilateral development cooperation with Pacific neighbours in areas of mutual interest to support the development and economic prosperity of the region. 38. Leaders agreed on the need to deepen our collaboration in support of Asean-led regional architecture. Australia commended Indonesia\u2019s leadership of the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, and welcomed Indonesia\u2019s plans to host the World Economic Forum on Asean and the Indo-Pacific 2020 in July, in which Australia looks forward to participating. 39. Leaders reaffirmed their commitment for Australia and Indonesia to work collaboratively toward the establishment of a co-deployment to a United Nations Peacekeeping Operation as a new chapter in our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. They highlighted that the co-deployment would elevate our contribution to the implementation of the United Nations\u2019 Action for Peacekeeping initiative and our already strong and mature defence cooperation, as it would be the first time Australia and Indonesia deploy together. 40. Leaders also emphasised their commitment to continue to work together at the UN to support the international rules-based order, acknowledging Indonesia\u2019s term on the UN Security Council (2019-20) and both countries\u2019 current membership of the UN Human Rights Council (Australia 2018-20; Indonesia 2020-22). 41. Leaders welcomed continued cooperation between Indonesia and Australia in the G20, including in advocating for action to give effect to the G20 commitment to end IUU fishing and in supporting the G20 initiative on preventing terrorist exploitation of the internet. 42. Leaders affirmed the continued importance of Apec in promoting sustainable development and free, and open trade. Leaders will advocate for an ambitious Apec post-2020 vision to follow the 1994 Bogor Goals under Malaysia\u2019s Apec chairmanship in 2020. 43. Leaders recognised the importance of collaboration and cooperation in managing and responding to disaster risks and humanitarian crises in the Indo-Pacific region and will bolster these efforts through a new Indonesia-Australia Partnership in Disaster Risk Management, including to build capacity in disaster risk management at the sub-national level in Indonesia. 44. Building on decades of collaboration in the health sector, leaders agreed to explore new opportunities for bilateral and regional cooperation, including through a new Indonesia-Australia Health Security Partnership, which will operate in collaboration with Australia\u2019s Indo-Pacific Centre for Health Security to help prevent, detect and respond to health emergencies, including infectious disease outbreaks in our region. 45. President Widodo expressed his sincere gratitude to the Australian Government for the warm welcome and the hospitalities accorded to him and the Indonesian delegation during the state visit, which reflects the bonds of long-standing friendship and solid foundation for the advancement of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The statement continues: Maritime Cooperation 27. Leaders recognised the importance of maritime trade and the blue economy to Australia and Indonesia\u2019s collective prosperity. They committed to developing maritime connectivity between markets in the region. 28. Leaders expressed serious concerns about developments in the South China Sea, including the continued militarisation of disputed features, and reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace, security, stability, and freedom of navigation and overflight in the region. They called for disputes to be resolved peacefully in accordance with international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 1982. 29. Leaders noted negotiations between Asean and China towards a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea and underlined the importance of any Code of Conduct: being consistent with international law, particularly UNCLOS; not prejudicing the interests and rights of third parties or other states; and supporting existing, inclusive regional architecture. 30. Leaders committed to deepen practical cooperation on maritime issues to support common interests in the maritime domain, including in the areas of improving maritime domain awareness, supporting understanding of and adherence to UNCLOS, combatting illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing and other activities under the Joint Declaration on Maritime Cooperation\u2019s Plan of Action. Indonesia welcomes Australia\u2019s interest in a partnership to develop maritime and fishing capacities in Indonesia\u2019s outermost islands. 31. Leaders reaffirmed both countries\u2019 active interest in ocean sustainability. Indonesia and Australia co-led the establishment of the Regional Plan of Action to Promote Responsible Fishing Practices including Combating Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing in the Region (RPOA-IUU) and will continue to advance regional fisheries objectives through this important instrument. 32. Leaders welcomed the announcement of a cooperation arrangement with JCLEC that formalises the Maritime Training Faculty and will see an Australian Border Force official posted to JCLEC. 33. Leaders welcomed the cooperation between the Indonesian Directorate General of Sea Transportation (DGST) and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) that will result in the establishment of two significant maritime safety training facilities. 34. Leaders also welcomed the extension of the Arrangement between the Maritime Security Agency of the Republic of Indonesia (Bakamla) and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection as represented by the Australian Border Force (ABF) on Maritime Security Cooperation a further three years, the prospect of an Australian port visit by Bakamla, and acknowledged the tenth anniversary of desktop training cooperation between Bakamla and the ABF. 35. In acknowledgement of the serious and growing challenge of marine plastic waste, Leaders agreed to establish an Indonesia-Australia Systemic Innovation Lab on Marine Plastic Waste under the leadership of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Agency for Marine and Fishery Research and Human Resources of the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fishery. This new initiative will strengthen our research collaboration to help identify new approaches in tackling marine plastic waste across our region. The joint statement continues: Securing Our and the Region\u2019s Shared Interests 17. Leaders acknowledged the closeness of the two countries\u2019 wide-ranging bilateral cooperation on justice, law and security. They welcomed the achievements of the Australia Indonesia Partnership for Justice II, aimed at supporting Indonesia\u2019s law and justice institutions and civil society, and strengthening our overall security architecture. 18. Leaders acknowledged the need for an increased focus on countering violent extremism, and committed to work together to prevent radicalisation, challenge extremist propaganda, and maintain strong, cohesive, and multicultural and multi-faith societies. 19. Leaders highlighted the importance of bilateral strategic dialogue, including through the annual 2+2 meetings between foreign and defence ministers, held most recently in Bali in December 2019. 20. Leaders welcomed the ongoing Indonesia-Australia Ministerial Council on Law and Security, and the Indonesia-Australia Counter Terrorism Consultation as important forums for strengthening cooperation on the evolving threats of terrorism, transnational crime and cyber security. 21. Leaders highlighted the ongoing success of the sub-regional meeting established in 2017 and co-chaired by Indonesia and Australia as a regional mechanism to collectively respond to transnational security threats, particularly terrorism and foreign terrorist fighters. 22. Leaders emphasised the importance of an open, free and secure Internet to economic growth and innovation. Leaders welcomed the concrete program of bilateral activities underway, particularly cyber bootcamps for Indonesian officials, and regular training on cyber security, cyber policy and international law and norms. Leaders resolved to further deepen cooperation in areas of mutual interest and welcomed further initiatives supported by the Cyber Cooperation Program to strengthen cyber security skills, institutions and digital skills development through short-term fellowship opportunities. Leaders looked forward to the next Indonesia-Australia cyber policy dialogue taking place in 2020. 23. In the context of co-chairing the Bali Process, leaders acknowledged the two countries\u2019 constructive bilateral cooperation to counter people smuggling and trafficking in persons in collaboration with regional partners. Leaders looked forward to the next Bali Process Ministerial Conference taking place in late 2020. Leaders welcomed progress on the Bali Process Government and Business Forum to engage the private sector in addressing trafficking in persons and related exploitation. 24. Leaders emphasised the importance of protecting the victims and witnesses of serious transnational crimes such as trafficking in persons and terrorism. Indonesia and Australia have committed to work together to strengthen domestic and regional capacity to effectively assist victims and witnesses. 25. Leaders acknowledged that the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation (JCLEC) will continue to be a centre of excellence for capacity building on law enforcement in combating transnational, serious and organised crime. 26. Leaders witnessed the signing of a new Memorandum of Understanding on Transportation Security Cooperation, recognising the importance of the transport sector to the economic and social development of both countries. The joint statement continues: Connecting People 13. Leaders expressed their sincere sympathies to those affected by the bushfires in Australia, and the recent flooding in Jakarta. Australia welcomed the deployment of Indonesian military engineers to assist in the response to the bushfires. Leaders reflected on our countries\u2019 long and proud history of supporting each other in times of need \u2013 from TNI\u2019s assistance to Australia following Cyclone Tracy in 1974 to the ADF\u2019s assistance following the Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami in 2018. 14. Leaders recognised that shared links in areas such as education and research collaboration help to create greater understanding between our communities and act as a springboard for an even broader partnership between our two countries. Leaders welcomed the continuation of programs such as Building Relationships through Intercultural Dialogue and Growing Engagement (BRIDGE), the New Colombo Plan, the Destination Australia Program, the Darmasiswa Scholarship, and the Indonesia Arts and Culture Scholarship, which enhance interactions among students and teachers from both countries. 15. Leaders welcomed the announcement that Monash University will open a campus in Indonesia \u2013 the first foreign university campus in Indonesia \u2013 which will greatly strengthen educational collaboration between the two countries. 16. Leaders welcomed the holding of the first Interfaith Dialogue in Bandung in March 2019, and committed to another Interfaith Dialogue in 2021. It continues: Enhanced Economic and Development Partnership 5. Leaders welcomed the imminent completion of their respective domestic processes for the ratification of the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA\u2011CEPA). 6. Australia and Indonesia committed to deepening our economic, trade and investment relationship, including taking forward initiatives this year to harvest early benefits from IA\u2011CEPA ratification. This will include full implementation of IA-CEPA and early work on an IA\u2011CEPA Economic Cooperation Program; an Australian Business Week delegation led by the Australian Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, and a further visit by major Australian private sector investors; the establishment of a CEO Roundtable; the development of a Blueprint for Trade and Investment in Indonesia and assistance to Indonesian SME exporters. 7. A bilateral economic, trade and investment ministers\u2019 meeting will be inaugurated, to drive this deepening of cooperation on bilateral and global economic issues. A senior economic officials\u2019 meeting will also be established. 8. Leaders noted opportunities for increasing people-to-people links, including through IA\u2011CEPA\u2019s skills package, and that Indonesian access to Australia\u2019s work and holiday visa will increase from 1,000 to 4,100 upon IA-CEPA\u2019s entry into force, and increase further to 5,000 in the sixth year of the agreement. 9. Leaders reaffirmed the benefits of open markets and inclusive regional economic integration. Leaders committed to working constructively together through the G20, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) and other regional and multilateral fora to support the multilateral trading system and take forward WTO reform. Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and will work together to finalise all outstanding negotiations ahead of signature in 2020, completing an agreement which builds on the Asean-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA) and which complements IA-CEPA. 10. Through our longstanding economic partnership for development, leaders agreed to cooperate to encourage sustainable and inclusive economic growth and stability; address poverty and inequality; strengthen human capital, education and skills; promote women\u2019s leadership and empowerment; and support disability inclusion. 11. Given how close eastern Indonesia and northern Australia are, leaders agreed to explore ways to further boost economic cooperation and connectivity, including through better transportation links. 12. Leaders highlighted opportunities for collaboration on the relocation of Indonesia\u2019s capital city, a national development priority for Indonesia. Scott Morrison and Joko Widodo have released their joint statement, which outlines what has been agreed upon in their bilateral talks so far: 1. During President Joko Widodo\u2019s state visit to Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and President Widodo met for the Indonesia-Australia annual leaders\u2019 meeting and held a joint ministerial meeting with other Australian and Indonesian ministers in Canberra on 10 February 2020. 2. Leaders acknowledged the recent 70th anniversary of formal diplomatic relations between Australia and Indonesia, and agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation under the five pillars of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership established in 2018. 3. Leaders witnessed the signing of the Plan of Action for the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership by foreign ministers, which outlines the practical cooperation between the two countries for 2020-2024. 4. Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the Lombok Treaty, signed in 2006, which outlines Indonesia and Australia\u2019s respect for each other\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as being the bedrock of our defence and security relationship. The last time a leader from another nation addressed the Australian parliament, was in October 2016, when Singapore prime minister Lee Hsein Loong gave a speech. Joko Widodo has been announced and he has taken his seat of honour, ready to make his address. While we wait for the address to begin, Murph has taken a look at just how Scott Morrison uses the lack of trust in the political system to his advantage in the latest Full Story podcast. Malcolm and Lucy Turnbull are in the gallery for Jokowi\u2019s address. Turnbull and Widodo were quite close as leaders \u2013 you may remember that Turnbull was sent to Indonesia by Scott Morrison to smooth things over after Morrison floated the idea of moving the Israeli embassy during the Wentworth byelection. Joko Widodo\u2019s address to parliament is about to begin. The House is filling up. Senators have been invited as guests. Question time will be pushed back until about 2.30 to accommodate the change in schedule. The assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, has lodged some regulations revealing details about the census, including that it will be held on 10 August, 2021 and there will be two new questions on defence force service and health conditions diagnosed by a doctor or nurse. This appears to end a scuffle in the government over whether to include two new questions on gender and sexuality. Last week Guardian Australia reported that health minister Greg Hunt had lobbied Sukkar to include the questions because they would\u201dgreatly inform the government\u2019s knowledge about the LGBTI+ population cohort in Australia in the 2021 census\u201d. The Australian Bureau of Statistics had noted that two federal departments need the data to deliver services and it would have \u201cstrong value across all levels of government\u201d but recommended sexual orientation not be added to the census due to possible backlash. A spokesman for Sukkar told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe government has accepted the recommendations of the Australian Bureau of Statistics regarding topics that should be included in the 2021 Census, which ensures the information collected reflects Australia\u2019s priority information needs.\u201d Back to the Joko Widodo visit: Jokowi also addressed the media, saying the visit marked a \u201cnew beginning\u201d for the two countries following the signing of the Indonesia-Australia comprehensive economic partnership agreement \u2013 the official name for the free trade agreement signed between the two countries. \u201cThis means going forward, the economic relationship between the two countries will grow and bring more tangible benefits to the people,\u201d he said. He added that the two leaders had discussed opportunities for Australia in the areas of infrastructure and education investment in Indonesia, as well as strategic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. He spoke about the hope for \u201cpeace and stability\u201d in the region, with the pair discussing the security situation in the South China Sea and climate change action, with particular reference to Pacific island nations. Despite Indonesia being one of the most important democracies in the region, the media statement from Jokowi did not allow for journalists to ask any questions. So, just to recap \u2013 Llew O\u2019Brien has quit the National party but not the LNP. In Queensland, the Liberal-National coalition is formalised as one party. So NOTHING HAS CHANGED. He will sit with the Coalition in the chamber, he will sit in the joint Coalition party room and he will vote with the government, because he is still a member of the government. He just won\u2019t be going to National party room meetings anymore. Which sounds like a win-win. Much like when my maths teacher would make me sit outside the classroom for being \u201ceasily distracted and a distraction to others\u201d. Barnaby Joyce released his text message to Scott Morrison to Sky News this morning, explaining just why he is throwing a tantrum over Michael McCormack\u2019s cabinet picks: \u201cSorry Scott but Michael picking only those who voted for him is foolish as it leaves little room for ownership to the team and as such makes things precarious\u201d. It\u2019s worth noting that the last time there was a leadership tantrum in the Nationals, McCormack did include Joyce backers in the cabinet. And this text message seems fine to release, but Joyce apparently can\u2019t release his \u2018text message\u2019 reports he made to Morrison as the drought envoy. Those relating to government to policy need to stay secret, but texts about internal party waa-waa-crying-face sulks are apparently in the public interest. Anthony Albanese\u2019s son Nathan is in parliament today \u2013 he will be the opposition leader\u2019s guest at Joko Widodo\u2019s address Scott Morrison was a little more expansive on what the chat between himself and Joko Widodo was about: We have also agreed to establish an energy dialogue between Australia and Indonesia. We have much to share, both in understanding of the challenges and as Indonesia is going through an accelerated development path, [about] how we can ensure that the fuel sources for the future are very much part of Indonesia\u2019s development and Australia\u2019s. We will be working together on science, research, technology and sharing our view of the future energy sources for both of our countries, and we look forward to that partnership for energy in Australia and Indonesia, but also how that might broadly lead our region. Monash University will establish its first foreign campus in Indonesia under this agreement, and that is an indication of how this is a two-way street. Not only that, but the treasurer today reinforced the opportunity for Australian pension funds, superannuation funds, to be looking at the opportunities that exist in Indonesia, as they do in many other countries around the world, and we see that investment partnership is a key part of how the agreement will be realised. On the issues of strategic security in our region, Indonesia is a leader and wonderful partner to Australia, whether it is on maritime cooperation or working together with international peacekeeping, which we will now be seeking to do. This is just a further layer in what is already a very, very deep relationship, and when it comes to the South China Sea, we share our commitment to sovereignty, stability and respect for the rule of international law. We have also discussed today ... challenges around counterterrorism, countering foreign fighters and influence. These are issues in which we are sharing expertise under view of the world. Finally, we have the opportunity to talk through issues of the coronavirus and the measures we are taking in concert and the information we are sharing to contain the impact of the coronavirus in Indonesia and Australia, and we will continue to work closely with our medical advisors and the other arrangements we have to ensure we can both effectively carry out our responsibilities to our peoples to keep the health and well-being of our peoples in the highest possible order. As you can see, it\u2019s been a very wide-ranging discussion. Zali Steggall and her crossbench colleagues have just held a press conference marking the introduction of her climate bill. Steggall is trying to nudge Liberals inclined to talk about the importance of climate action to do something about it. She wants a conscience vote, and she wants MPs to consider how they might \u201cdeliver safety and certainty for their electorates\u201d. Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie says a conscience vote creates an opportunity \u201cfor modern Liberals to stand and take some action\u201d. The Victorian independent Helen Haines says this bill represents an opportunity for parliamentarians to restore trust in politics, by projecting a capacity to work together. Steggall has not yet discussed the bill with Scott Morrison. It\u2019s not clear whether there will be support to bring it on in the parliament. Steggall makes it clear she wants to build support in the community to pressure MPs to move the bill forward. She\u2019s set up a website to accompany the bill and says if MPs decline the opportunity to be constructive \u201ctheir electorates will be made very aware of their position\u201d. The bill includes a commitment to achieving net zero by 2050, specifies the need to have an adaptation plan, and establishes an independent climate commission. Scott Morrison is welcoming Joko Widodo to Canberra, in one of the committee rooms. Widodo will address the House later this morning. The bilateral talks are all about trade and security (when are they not?) but there is a bit of climate and energy thrown in for good measure. Morrison: We have discussed many issues as part of our growing partnership, our growing agenda, between our two nations. The 100 day action plan for the implementation of the agreement will see it, as it comes into effect, ramped up and the momentum established at all levels. [It will be] a mutually beneficial arrangement, one that sees the cooperation of our economies for the strong growth that it will see over the next decade and beyond. Indonesia will be one of the star economies of the world over the next 10 to 20 years and this arrangement, this mutually beneficial arrangement, will ensure that our economy is linked for this exciting period of growth in the years ahead. Today we have agreed to include new elements as part of this implementation. We are pleased that our home affairs minister here in Australia will be engaging with his Indonesian counterpart to proceed to look at how we can simplify and streamline the issues of entry into Australia. We also agree to reconsider and look at the issues of travel advice in Indonesia, particularly for those areas most frequented by Australian visitors. Indonesia is a very large country with a very large population, and we need to ensure that we have this flexibility that respects and understands that, and we thank the president and his ministers for raising these issues with us. We have also agreed to establish an energy dialogue between Australia and Indonesia. Really, really looking forward to Pauline Hanson defining \u201ctraditional sex\u201d in the Senate when she enters her latest WTAF piece of legislation: From the \u201cwhy is this happening\u201d file \u2013 The Prohibiting the Indoctrination of Children bill would counteract a wide range of issues described as indoctrination of young children: including skewed versions of history taught as fact, controversial sexual programs that teach gender fluidity and realignment to infants, unsubstantiated human-induced climate change, as well as the teachings of so-called \u201csafe\u201d underage sex, sexting, and non-traditional sex. The bill recognises parents across Australia who have concerns about biased teachings, they don\u2019t like the teaching of non-traditional and controversial views that don\u2019t give the full picture; they want to protect and strengthen their children, and this bill does that. Parents want a sensible curriculum that sets their children up for meaningful, employable futures, without the distraction of false or imbalanced ideology. Under his eye, yadda, yadda, yadda. Matt Canavan has written an article for the Courier Mail, where he came up with this line: Renewable energy can complement our energy needs but renewables do not run all the time making them unsuitable to support manufacturing jobs. Renewables are the dole bludgers of the energy system, they only turn up to work when they want to. First of all \u2013 sigh. Secondly, I guess that makes coal the franking credit recipients of the energy system \u2013 holding on, despite the death throes and the impacts to the rest of society. Good times: That \u201cinner city Liberal\u201d Christensen is talking about, is Trent Zimmerman, who made comments on Sky this morning that he didn\u2019t believe investing in coal was a role for the government \u2013 that the market could decide. That\u2019s Labor\u2019s position as well \u2013 even Joel Fitzgibbon manages to hold on to that one. The bells are ringing \u2013parliament is about to begin The government has said it will be releasing its 2050 emissions strategy ahead of the climate meeting in Glasgow (which they have to, in order to be able to trade with the EU, as the French foreign minister has already told us). But the government is also still trying to calm down its party room, which has a section completely obsessed with coal. It\u2019s funding a $4m feasibility study into a north Queensland coal power station, because it\u2019s trying to kick that fight down the road. Mathias Cormann had a chat about that to the ABC this morning: We always said that we would support a feasibility study like the one that\u2019s been announced, and you know, obviously coal will continue to be an important part of our energy mix in the foreseeable future, and a high efficiency, low emissions coal-fired power station, obviously, can be an important part of helping us meet our emissions reduction targets. But ultimately, a project like that will have to stack up commercially. It will have to stack up on its own right. And that is obviously a matter for after the feasibility study. I mean, the whole range of industries, exporting industries, manufacturing exporting industries in Australia, do need access to reliable, affordable power, and obviously we want to ensure that that power is environmentally as efficient as possible. And in that context, this feasibility study, hopefully, will be able to demonstrate that this project can stack up based on private sector investment. Australia produces about 6% of global coal, it has responsibility for about 6% of global coal production. I think you\u2019ll find that Australia will continue to be a significant producer, exporter and consumer of it. And of course, Australian coal is environmentally much more efficient than the coal alternatives from other parts of the world. I mean, our coal, our black coal, is ... it obviously has lower moisture content, lower ash content, higher energy intensity. And it is, obviously, in the interests of the environment for more Australian coal to be used and for it to displace coal from other sources, which is more polluting. Oxfam has welcomed Zali Steggall and the crossbench climate bill. From the group\u2019s climate change advisor Simon Bradshaw: This bill represents the minimum action necessary to bring Australia into line with comparable countries and to get us on the path to zero emissions as soon as possible. It is an important and practical step that deserves support from all sides of politics. As parliament resumes after a horrendous summer of extreme weather and bushfires, we welcome this move by Ms Steggall, which is a response to community sentiment to \u2018just get on with it\u2019 when it comes to setting the framework required to address the climate crisis. Importantly, by beginning a sequence of five-year emissions budgets, guided by independent advice, the bill requires a strengthening of Australia\u2019s existing and woefully inadequate 2030 emissions reduction targets. We recognise that this proposed law alone will not be enough to ensure Australia plays its part in limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and avoiding a future of ever more devastating climate disruption, and that it will need to be accompanied by determined efforts to shift Australia rapidly beyond coal and gas and to 100% clean exports by 2030. Nonetheless, it is an important foundation. The climate crisis affects every one of us. Globally, it is the single greatest threat in the fight against hunger and poverty. Here in Australia, it is already taking an enormous toll on the lives and livelihoods of many Australians. If Australia can break free from decades of policy paralysis and partisan battles over climate action, we can not only help ensure a safer future for Australians and people everywhere, but equally realise Australia\u2019s huge potential to prosper in a zero-carbon world. It\u2019s time for our leaders to act. Zali Steggall has released the Climate Change (National Framework for Adaptation and Mitigation) bill 2020. The crossbench are hoping to get a conscience vote on this. But for those wondering what it\u2019s all about, here is the introduction to the bill. This act establishes a framework for adaptation and mitigation in relation to climate change. Decision-makers must consider seven guiding principles when performing functions or duties or exercising powers under this act or provisions of other prescribed acts. The commission is required to prepare a national climate change risk assessment within a year of the commencement of this act and every five years after that. In response to each national climate change risk assessment, the minister must prepare a national adaptation plan. The commission must evaluate the implementation of these plans annually. This act sets a target of zero net accounting emissions by 2050. The target can only be changed if there is a significant change in circumstances and the commission is satisfied the significant change justifies the change. In order to meet the net zero target, the act also provides for the minister to set emissions budgets for emissions budget periods on advice from the commission. The minister must also prepare emissions reduction plans for each emissions budget. The commission provides advice on these plans also. This act establishes the commission and provides for a Parliamentary Joint Committee on climate Adaptation and Mitigation. Appointments to the commission must be approved by the committee. Just a reminder \u2013 this is not a very sad situation. Literally nothing changes. Nothing. If Llew O\u2019Brien is still a member of the LNP, he is still a member of the government. He is just not sitting in the Nationals party room, and is freed to slam Michael McCormack\u2019s leadership even more. And for the pedants out there, a clarification: Joko Widodo will not be addressing a joint sitting of the parliament \u2013 just the House. But senators are invited to watch as guests. Over in the Senate, and Labor wants to try and address some issues with the encryption laws \u2013 the ones Labor had passed, in the hopes that it could fix the legislation if it won the election. We all know how that played out. Today, Labor will try and have the recommendations the intelligence and security committee put forward, which the government did not implement. From Kristina Keneally: Today in the Senate, Labor will debate a private senator\u2019s bill \u2013 Telecommunications Amendment (Repairing Assistance and Access) bill 2019. The bill implements the bipartisan recommendations of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security. The amendments in Labor\u2019s bill were agreed to by Liberal PJCIS members and promised by the government some 14 months ago. The Australian tech sector holds great potential for economic growth and job creation, but is being held back by the Morrison government\u2019s failure to deliver these legislative changes. Tech companies report that customers are less likely to seek out contracts with Australian companies because the encryption laws pose risks that they would be required by the government to introduce systemic weaknesses into their products and systems. ... Labor\u2019s plans to improve the flawed encryption legislation have been supported by the Communications Alliance, StartupAus, the Australian Industry Group, BSA The Software Alliance, the Human Rights Law Centre, Digital Rights Watch, Electronic Frontiers Australia and the Australian Privacy Foundation. In bipartisanship news, Dave Sharma and Josh Burns will introduce a private members motion together, calling on Israel to extradite Malka Leifer. Leifer is wanted on 74 charges related to child sexual abuse dating back to when she was principal of the Adass Isreal school in Melbourne. Australia first requested Leifer be extradited in 2014. From the joint release: There have been 63 court hearings since that time, and the case still has not moved to the formal extradition phase, despite a psychiatric panel declaring Malka Leifer fit for extradition in January this year. Leifer\u2019s alleged victims, sisters Dassi Erlich, Nicole Meyer and Elly Sapper, have waited long enough for their former principal to face justice in Australia. Indonesian president Joko Widodo is (literally) in the House. He\u2019ll sign the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA-CEPA) with Scott Morrison and address the parliament later this morning. Amnesty International has called on Morrison to raise the West Papuan situation with Widodo and Greens leader Adam Bandt and former leader Richard Di Natale will be wearing West Papuan lapel flags during the address. West Papuan human rights advocate Ronny Kareni will also be Di Natale\u2019s guest. Kareni \u201cis a member of the United Liberation Movement for West Papua and is a longstanding campaigner for West Papuan human rights\u201d. OK. Back on deck now (the rain, welcome as it is, led to a few logistical problems for me this morning, so apologies). What does the Llew O\u2019Brien drama mean? Nothing really. He remains in the LNP, and he\u2019ll sit in the joint party room. He just won\u2019t sit in the Nationals party room. He is a pretty conservative guy, so there is no way on Lizzo\u2019s green earth he won\u2019t vote with the government 99% of the time. The government\u2019s two-seat majority is not in doubt. He\u2019ll just be free(er \u2013 he has never been a quiet one) to make a bit more noise. A bit like Kevin Hogan after Malcolm Turnbull was rolled. Hogan stayed in the Nationals but sat on the crossbench in the chamber. O\u2019Brien remains in the LNP, so he is still a member of the government, but won\u2019t sit in the Nationals party room. It\u2019s the clayton\u2019s crossbench. Here is AAP on Llew O\u2019Brien: Nationals backbencher Llew O\u2019Brien has quit the party following Barnaby Joyce\u2019s failed leadership bid. O\u2019Brien told Scott Morrison of his decision on Sunday night. He will remain in the Coalition party room. \u201cO\u2019Brien joined the LNP at its inception and remains a member of the LNP. O\u2019Brien will not make any statements until after he has met with the prime minister,\u201d his spokeswoman told AAP on Monday. The member for Wide Bay in Queensland was among Barnaby Joyce supporters who were last week threatening to cross the floor and block Coalition legislation after the failed leadership bid. Senior government minister Mathias Cormann said O\u2019Brien would still be a member of the Liberal National party. \u201cHe continues to support the government \u2013 that is what he has made clear to the prime minister,\u201d Cormann said. O\u2019Brien will give the government supply. The Nationals just keep on keeping on, don\u2019t they? The Courier Mail reports Wide Bay (one of the safest Liberal National party seats in Queensland) MP Llew O\u2019Brien quit the National party last night, after a \u201cshouting match\u201d with Michael McCormack. You can read the whole story here in the Courier Mail. O\u2019Brien is the MP who brought on the leadership spill last week. Seems he is still not over it. His local paper reports he told Scott Morrison last night he was going to quit the National party \u2013 but Morrison has granted him permission to stay in the LNP. What that means I am not quite sure, but at this stage, O\u2019Brien won\u2019t be sitting in the National party room or the Liberal party room. And he\u2019ll still give the government supply. But he will be free to cross the floor on a whole heap of other issues, like ensuring integrity. Meanwhile, it seems George Christensen is falling into line. But don\u2019t think this is over. Not by a long shot. There are a group of National MPs who seem pretty determined to get their way and they don\u2019t seem to mind what the consequences are. That\u2019s not something that is going to just pass. In my experience, it\u2019s something which festers. Oh, and Indonesian president Joko Widodo is in town for a bilateral visit. He will address the parliament today, becoming only the second Indonesian leader to do so. And Zali Steggall, Helen Haines, Rebekha Sharkie and Andrew Wilkie will be releasing a climate bill today. They want a bipartisan approach to preparing for climate change and are hoping to get a conscience vote on the issue. Stay tuned for all of that and more as the day unfolds, with Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and a one-coffee me at your service. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "bodyText": "The government has suffered a \u201chumiliating\u201d defeat on the floor of parliament after Labor successfully overruled the Coalition and elevated renegade Nationals MP Llew O\u2019Brien as deputy Speaker. O\u2019Brien, who quit the Nationals\u2019 partyroom on Monday morning after a clash with leader Michael McCormack, accepted Labor\u2019s nomination for deputy Speaker in an attempt to deny the government\u2019s endorsed candidate, the Victorian MP Damian Drum. In a secret ballot of MPs in the House of Representatives, Nationals MPs defected to join Labor and crossbench MPs to support O\u2019Brien. The Queensland MP won by 75 votes to 67. The shock vote will pile further pressure on McCormack, who survived a leadership challenge from the former deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, last week, but who continues to face internal criticism, particularly among Queensland MPs. O\u2019Brien, who moved the spill motion against McCormack, said it was an \u201chonour\u201d to accept the position that comes with a 20% pay rise \u2013 the equivalent of $42,000. \u201cIt is a tremendous privilege to be in this place,\u201d the member for the safe LNP seat of Wide Bay said. \u201cEvery election we put ourselves forward to our constituents to serve them in the most honest and best way that we can. \u201cI am privileged to be here. As a country policeman, I find it incredible that I can walk into this place and take part in this.\u201d The Speaker, Tony Smith, said he needed to check the standing orders to ensure that O\u2019Brien\u2019s decision to quit the National party did not affect his eligibility for the role, but O\u2019Brien clarified that he remained a \u201cloyal and faithful\u201d government member. \u201cI have clearly stated that I am still a member of the government \u2013 I do not sit in the Nationals partyroom, I sit as a member of the LNP, which was what was on my ballot paper when I put myself before the people of Wide Bay.\u201d Despite the turmoil, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, attempted to spin the result as a positive, saying the House had to choose between two experienced government members. \u201cThere is no shortage of government members in this House to ensure that we continue to deliver on the promises that we made to the Australian people \u2026 and these government members will continue to ensure that a strong economy, a safer Australia, and a government that will continue to meet the needs of the Australian people will be delivered on each and every day that this government majority continues to serve in the house,\u201d he said. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, congratulated O\u2019Brien for \u201creceiving such strong support from his colleagues\u201d in Parliament. \u201cNo amount of marketing or spin can hide the humiliation for the government from that vote,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have just seen the stability of the Coalition on full view, for all to see \u2013 government members running against each other for a position of deputy Speaker \u2026 and for the prime minister to stand up and to pretend somehow this is a win. \u201cI congratulate the prime minister on his capacity to make anything into a marketing proposal.\u201d In response to the vote, McCormack said O\u2019Brien would do \u201ca good job\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s democracy,\u201d he said. The Nationals deputy whip, Ken O\u2019Dowd, told the ABC he was one of O\u2019Brien\u2019s colleagues who had voted to support his fellow Queenslander. O\u2019Dowd had also put his hand up for the position, but had lost out to Drum in the Nationals\u2019 partyroom. \u201cIt was good to see that Llew O\u2019Brien, who comes from Queensland, he is only a couple of doors away from where I live and I know he will do a good job,\u201d O\u2019Dowd said. \u201cIt is good to have one of our own in that position. Happy for him and happy for Queensland. We can\u2019t be all Victoria and NSW.\u201d Earlier the Courier Mail reported O\u2019Brien had quit the Nationals after a \u201cshouting match\u201d with McCormack over his leadership. NSW Nationals MP David Gillespie also reportedly accused McCormack of being a \u201cliar\u201d after he denied that Drum had been endorsed for the deputy Speaker\u2019s role.",

Jerome Salomon, a French senior health official, said in a televised statement: \u201cWe learned that there were two other cases linked to this cluster, two adults \u2013 one who was diagnosed in the United Kingdom and the other who was diagnosed in Mallorca \u2013 linked to a stay in the apartment in Les Contamines-Montjoie.\u201d The group had been staying in two apartments in a ski chalet in the Alpine resort area near Mont Blanc when they were visited by a British man on 24 January who had attended a business conference in Singapore, where he is believed to have contracted the virus. The event at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Singapore was hosted by Servomex, a UK gas analysis company, the Singapore newspaper Lianhe Wanbao reported. The British national, reported to be a middle-aged man from Brighton, was found to have the virus when he returned to the UK at the end of last month. He returned to London Gatwick Airport from Geneva on 28 January on an easyJet flight. In a statement, easyJet said Public Health England is contacting all passengers who were seated in the vicinity of the customer on flight EZS8481 from Geneva to Gatwick on 28 January to provide guidance in line with procedures. The airline added: \u201ceasyJet has been notified by the public health authority that a customer who had recently travelled on one of its flights has since been diagnosed with the Coronavirus. \u201cAs the customer was not experiencing any symptoms, the risk to others on board the flight is very low. \u201cWe remain in contact with the public health authorities and are following their guidance. The health and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is the airline\u2019s highest priority. \u201cAll of the crew who operated have been advised to monitor themselves for a 14 day period since the flight in line with Public Health England advice. Note this happened 12 days ago and none are displaying any symptoms.\u201d The man is thought to be the first UK national to contract the disease and was transferred to St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London, where there is an infectious diseases unit, last Thursday. Whitty said experts at Public Health England continue to work hard tracing patient contacts from the UK cases. He said of the case that emerged on Sunday: \u201cThey successfully identified this individual and ensured the appropriate support was provided. The patient has been transferred to a specialist NHS centre at the Royal Free hospital, and we are now using robust infection control measures to prevent any possible further spread of the virus.\u201d While the total number of cases in the UK stands at four, the government in the Balearic Islands confirmed a British man had tested positive for coronavirus in Mallorca. The man\u2019s wife and two daughters tested negative and were not showing any signs of having the virus. The family had been in France and had returned to Mallorca on 29 January and the father started to show light symptoms 24 hours later. Fernando Simon, director of the centre of coordination of health emergencies at at the Spanish health ministry, said the man was currently \u201cin good health\u201d but was being kept in isolation and authorities were drawing up a list of everyone he may have come into contact with in Mallorca. On Sunday the second and final flight carrying British citizens from the coronavirus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan landed in Oxfordshire. The flight, with more than 200 people onboard including some foreign nationals, arrived at RAF Brize Norton shortly before 7.30am on Sunday. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the flight had brought back 105 British nationals and family members, as well as 95 foreign nationals and family members. A total of 13 staff and medical professionals were also onboard. The passengers were being taken to the Kents Hill Park hotel and conference centre in Milton Keynes to be quarantined for 14 days. Two British nationals were not allowed to board the flight after they initially failed temperature checks, although later checks were normal. One of them, Josh Skarratts, told Sky News: \u201cNow we are stranded in Wuhan having missed the last plane out of Wuhan and our last means of evacuation.\u201d Locals in the area of Kents Hill Park hotel told the Press Association they were unconcerned about living in close proximity to the quarantine area. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to go somewhere. You could say that it may have been better if they had been put in a more of an isolated place,\u201d said Stephen Szyelimski. \u201cI\u2019ve got no bones of contention. I\u2019ve got no upset. They\u2019ve got to do it, it\u2019s got to be done and it\u2019s got to be done properly. And I hope we get on top of it very quickly.\u201d The three joined buildings that make up Kents Hill Park were cordoned off with temporary wire fencing, and security officers will patrol the site for the duration of the quarantine. Staff in blue scrubs, gloves and masks were seen welcoming the arrivals on to the premises on Sunday morning, reported the Press Association. The conference centre and hotel is close to three schools. A spokesman for Milton Keynes council said: \u201cLocal schools have been alerted and are working to update and reassure parents\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Ornate, heavy necklaces gleam on stands above stacks of thick filigree bangles in the windows of Khartoum\u2019s gold market. The gold is Sudanese, dug from the rich mines that span the country.</p> <p>Shop owner Bashir Abdulay hands over a palm-sized lump of pure gold with two small bore holes as he explains how the prized metal goes from mine deposit, through middlemen, to Khartoum.</p> <p>Abdulay describes the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-darfur-gold/special-report-the-darfur-conflicts-deadly-gold-rush-idUSBRE99707G20131008\">Jebel Amer gold mine in Darfur</a>, one of several controlled by the Rapid Support Forces, the paramilitary group whose leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/29/hemedti-the-feared-commander-pulling-the-strings-in-sudan\">Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo</a> is now a central figure in Sudan\u2019s transition to democracy.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many people working there, some work on their own, others for the RSF. Everyone has his place, and the RSF have theirs,\u201d he says, the metal twinkling in the bright shop lights. \u201cThe RSF have a big place producing gold, and selling it on their own.\u201d</p> <p>The RSF seized control of the Jebel Amer gold mine in Darfur in 2017, immediately making Dagalo, known as Hemedti, one of Sudan\u2019s richest men. The RSF and Hemedti also control at least three other goldmines in other parts of the country, such as South Kordofan, making them a key player in an industry that produces Sudan\u2019s <a href=\"https://oec.world/en/profile/country/sdn/\">largest export</a>.</p> <p>After the 2019 uprising that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/11/sudan-army-ousts-bashir-after-30-years-in-power\">overthrew</a> former dictator Omar al-Bashir, Hemedti became part of the transitional military council and the sovereignty council designed to shepherd Sudan to democracy before elections are held in 2022.</p> <p>Despite tentative government efforts to wrestle parts of the gold industry away from Sudan\u2019s security services and back under state or private control, questions remain about whether Sudan can truly transition to democracy while the politically powerful RSF run a parallel economy all of their own.</p> <p>To buy gold from the RSF, where do you go? Abdulay answers without hesitation: \u201cAl Gunade have an office upstairs on the second floor,\u201d he said, gesturing at the ceiling, unapologetically connecting the two organisations.</p> <p>Al Gunade is a mining and trading corporation with deep ties to Hemedti and the RSF. Hemedti\u2019s brother Abdul Rahim Dagalo and his sons are the three owners of Al Gunade, while reported RSF deputy Abdul Rahman al-Bakri is the general manager. </p> <p>According to one of the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6469821-Al-G.html#document/p1/a530944\">documents</a> obtained by the anti-corruption NGO Global Witness, Hemedti himself sits on the board of directors. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b80a6024aebf5c5d7c26d89ef9367e123b1bda9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b80a6024aebf5c5d7c26d89ef9367e123b1bda9/0_48_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of Sudan\u2019s Rapid Support Forces, at a meeting in Khartoum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of Sudan\u2019s Rapid Support Forces, at a meeting in Khartoum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00dcmit Bekta\u015f/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After reviewing evidence of the activities of Al Gunade and the RSF, <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en-gb/campaigns/conflict-minerals/exposing-rsfs-secret-financial-network/\">Global Witness concluded</a> that \u201cthe RSF and a connected company have captured a swathe of the country\u2019s gold industry and are likely using it to fund their operations\u201d.</p> <p>The organisation obtained bank data and corporate documents that, they say, show the RSF maintains a bank account in their name at the National Bank of Abu Dhabi (now part of the First Abu Dhabi Bank) in the United Arab Emirates, providing \u201cevidence of the financial autonomy of the RSF\u201d.</p> <p>The UAE is by far the largest importer of Sudanese gold in the world. Global trade data from 2018 shows it <a href=\"https://trademap.org/Country_SelProductCountry.aspx?nvpm=1%7c729%7c%7c%7c%7c7108%7c%7c%7c4%7c1%7c2%7c2%7c1%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c1\">imported</a> 99.2% of the country\u2019s gold exports.

Global Witness believes the RSF is \u201can organisation whose military power and financial independence poses a threat to a peaceful democratic transition in Sudan\u201d.</p> <p>A former camel-trader, Hemedti gained his nickname from the words \u201cmy protector\u201d. Before taking part in the coup that toppled him, he was the right-hand man of former dictator Bashir. Hemedti\u2019s RSF grew out of the infamous Janjaweed militia active in Darfur, described as \u201cmen with no mercy\u201d and accused of war crimes in a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/09/09/men-no-mercy/rapid-support-forces-attacks-against-civilians-darfur-sudan\">2015 Human Rights Watch report</a>. HRW found that during the RSF\u2019s campaign in Darfur, the militia were responsible for \u201cegregious abuses against civilians \u2026 torture, extrajudicial killings and mass rapes\u201d, as well as \u201cthe forced displacement of entire communities; the destruction of wells, food stores and other infrastructure necessary for sustaining life in a harsh desert environment\u201d.</p> <p>Last June, the RSF were accused of <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/11/17/they-were-shouting-kill-them/sudans-violent-crackdown-protesters-khartoum\">attacking peaceful protest</a><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/11/17/they-were-shouting-kill-them/sudans-violent-crackdown-protesters-khartoum\">ers</a> to disperse a sit-in in Khartoum calling for a handover to civilian rule. Protestors and observers <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/06/sudan-remove-rapid-support-forces-from-khartoum-streets-immediately/\">said</a> the RSF brought the violent methods deployed in Blue Nile, South Kordofan and Darfur to the capital, shooting, stabbing, burning or crushing the skulls of at least 104 civilians, dumping bodies in the Nile, and raping at least 70 men and women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"570f839294648f4cb9cf58d3fa49caa3cfa509c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/570f839294648f4cb9cf58d3fa49caa3cfa509c9/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Rapid Support Forces secure a site in Khartoum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the Rapid Support Forces secure a site in Khartoum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00dcmit Bekta\u015f/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The RSF have consistently denied their involvement.

He dismisses any notion of the RSF\u2019s involvement in violence against protesters, branding accusations of war crimes against Hemedti and the Janjaweed as \u201cpropaganda\u201d.</p> <p>Both of Al Gunade\u2019s two offices above Khartoum\u2019s gold market are accessed via a dank staircase where bare wires jostle for space on the filthy walls. </p> <p>Behind the tinted windows of Gunade\u2019s offices, a kilogram gold bar sat on a lacquered wooden desk among office stationary, an ostentatious paperweight that may be the real thing. A man who repeatedly refused to give his name referred all questions about Al Gunade to the central bank, opening the office door to indicate that no further discussion would be accepted.</p> <p>Sudanese authorities have begun attempts to overhaul the gold trade, dissolving mining companies involved with the former regime\u2019s security services. Sudan now allows <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-gold/sudan-opens-up-gold-market-in-bid-to-raise-revenue-idUSKBN1Z81M2\">private traders to export gold</a> provided 30% of deposits remain in the central bank.</p> <p>An official from Sudan\u2019s mining ministry, who cannot be named as they are not permitted to brief the media<strong>,</strong> said extra checks are made to screen out companies associated with the previous regime.

Around the corner from the glistening mall where Tabidi works, men perch on bonnets in a car park, flicking fat wads of Sudanese pounds to signal their trade to drivers passing through.

      "bodyText": "Ornate, heavy necklaces gleam on stands above stacks of thick filigree bangles in the windows of Khartoum\u2019s gold market. The gold is Sudanese, dug from the rich mines that span the country. Shop owner Bashir Abdulay hands over a palm-sized lump of pure gold with two small bore holes as he explains how the prized metal goes from mine deposit, through middlemen, to Khartoum. Abdulay describes the Jebel Amer gold mine in Darfur, one of several controlled by the Rapid Support Forces, the paramilitary group whose leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo is now a central figure in Sudan\u2019s transition to democracy. \u201cThere are many people working there, some work on their own, others for the RSF. Everyone has his place, and the RSF have theirs,\u201d he says, the metal twinkling in the bright shop lights. \u201cThe RSF have a big place producing gold, and selling it on their own.\u201d The RSF seized control of the Jebel Amer gold mine in Darfur in 2017, immediately making Dagalo, known as Hemedti, one of Sudan\u2019s richest men. The RSF and Hemedti also control at least three other goldmines in other parts of the country, such as South Kordofan, making them a key player in an industry that produces Sudan\u2019s largest export. After the 2019 uprising that overthrew former dictator Omar al-Bashir, Hemedti became part of the transitional military council and the sovereignty council designed to shepherd Sudan to democracy before elections are held in 2022. Despite tentative government efforts to wrestle parts of the gold industry away from Sudan\u2019s security services and back under state or private control, questions remain about whether Sudan can truly transition to democracy while the politically powerful RSF run a parallel economy all of their own. To buy gold from the RSF, where do you go? Abdulay answers without hesitation: \u201cAl Gunade have an office upstairs on the second floor,\u201d he said, gesturing at the ceiling, unapologetically connecting the two organisations. Al Gunade is a mining and trading corporation with deep ties to Hemedti and the RSF. Hemedti\u2019s brother Abdul Rahim Dagalo and his sons are the three owners of Al Gunade, while reported RSF deputy Abdul Rahman al-Bakri is the general manager. According to one of the documents obtained by the anti-corruption NGO Global Witness, Hemedti himself sits on the board of directors. After reviewing evidence of the activities of Al Gunade and the RSF, Global Witness concluded that \u201cthe RSF and a connected company have captured a swathe of the country\u2019s gold industry and are likely using it to fund their operations\u201d. The organisation obtained bank data and corporate documents that, they say, show the RSF maintains a bank account in their name at the National Bank of Abu Dhabi (now part of the First Abu Dhabi Bank) in the United Arab Emirates, providing \u201cevidence of the financial autonomy of the RSF\u201d. The UAE is by far the largest importer of Sudanese gold in the world. Global trade data from 2018 shows it imported 99.2% of the country\u2019s gold exports. The Gulf nation has also subcontracted RSF militiamen to fight in Yemen and Libya, providing funds to the RSF. The relationship between Sudan\u2019s gold, wealthy foreign backers and the RSF militia is concerning observers. Global Witness believes the RSF is \u201can organisation whose military power and financial independence poses a threat to a peaceful democratic transition in Sudan\u201d. A former camel-trader, Hemedti gained his nickname from the words \u201cmy protector\u201d. Before taking part in the coup that toppled him, he was the right-hand man of former dictator Bashir. Hemedti\u2019s RSF grew out of the infamous Janjaweed militia active in Darfur, described as \u201cmen with no mercy\u201d and accused of war crimes in a 2015 Human Rights Watch report. HRW found that during the RSF\u2019s campaign in Darfur, the militia were responsible for \u201cegregious abuses against civilians \u2026 torture, extrajudicial killings and mass rapes\u201d, as well as \u201cthe forced displacement of entire communities; the destruction of wells, food stores and other infrastructure necessary for sustaining life in a harsh desert environment\u201d. Last June, the RSF were accused of attacking peaceful protesters to disperse a sit-in in Khartoum calling for a handover to civilian rule. Protestors and observers said the RSF brought the violent methods deployed in Blue Nile, South Kordofan and Darfur to the capital, shooting, stabbing, burning or crushing the skulls of at least 104 civilians, dumping bodies in the Nile, and raping at least 70 men and women. The RSF have consistently denied their involvement. An investigation is ongoing. \u201cHemedti himself, he understands the process of transition personally,\u201d says Montaser Ibrahim, a former human rights defender who works with the RSF as an \u201cunofficial consultant\u201d on human rights. \u201cThis is one of the reasons that led me to deal with him.\u201d His new role has led to criticism from some in human rights activism, but Ibrahim sees the RSF as champions of minority rights, and Hemedti as a challenge against political elites. \u201cHemedti is a revolutionary,\u201d he says. He dismisses any notion of the RSF\u2019s involvement in violence against protesters, branding accusations of war crimes against Hemedti and the Janjaweed as \u201cpropaganda\u201d. Both of Al Gunade\u2019s two offices above Khartoum\u2019s gold market are accessed via a dank staircase where bare wires jostle for space on the filthy walls. Behind the tinted windows of Gunade\u2019s offices, a kilogram gold bar sat on a lacquered wooden desk among office stationary, an ostentatious paperweight that may be the real thing. A man who repeatedly refused to give his name referred all questions about Al Gunade to the central bank, opening the office door to indicate that no further discussion would be accepted. Sudanese authorities have begun attempts to overhaul the gold trade, dissolving mining companies involved with the former regime\u2019s security services. Sudan now allows private traders to export gold provided 30% of deposits remain in the central bank. An official from Sudan\u2019s mining ministry, who cannot be named as they are not permitted to brief the media, said extra checks are made to screen out companies associated with the previous regime. The official said that the people behind a company mattered less than whether or not it followed the rules. \u201cNow even if the head of the transitional military council came himself, he has to go with the regulations,\u201d the official said. Mohammed Tabidi, a Khartoum gold trader, says the new gold trading laws are a world away from those under the previous government that forced traders to buy gold from Sudan\u2019s security services, or face arrest. \u201cIt\u2019s a free market now,\u201d he says. He is hopeful about the possibilities of free trade amid a powerful black market and spiralling inflation that make daily life a struggle for many. Around the corner from the glistening mall where Tabidi works, men perch on bonnets in a car park, flicking fat wads of Sudanese pounds to signal their trade to drivers passing through. The official rate of 25 Sudanese pounds to the dollar is obsolete compared with the black market rate of 75, maybe even 80. Tabidi says that while gold companies associated with other security services were rendered obsolete by the overhaul, Al Gunade remained. \u201cThere is no company similar to Al Gunade [now],\u201d he says. \u201cThere is nothing else like it.\u201d The law is in flux, he says, and it is up to the authorities whether Al Gunade will continue. \u201cIf export opens for traders, maybe Al Gunade won\u2019t work,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if they get a deal with the ministry of finance, they can.\u201d \u201cHemedti now is vice-president,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some things I can\u2019t talk about.\u201d The RSF said in December that they would hand control of Jebel Amer to the government. Who will reap the profits remains very much in question, given the lack of transparency in Sudan\u2019s gold industry and the difficulties in controlling a supply chain plagued by smuggling and remote sites controlled by militias. There are also few safeguards in place to prevent the RSF and Al Gunade operating illegally. Richard Kent of Global Witness is critical of the RSF\u2019s claim: \u201cWe welcome the development because it is potentially very beneficial to the Sudanese people and gold industry, but it\u2019s still unclear exactly what this means,\u201d he says. \u201cDoes this mean giving up the Al Gunade concession, reinstating some kind of civil or traditional administration \u2013 and if so how would that work, would it be independently appointed by the civilian government?\u201d Political transition offers the tools needed to transform Sudan\u2019s most lucrative industry, cleaning up ministries and the supply chain.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI always found myself playing the part of terrorist number two, [with] just one line: \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019.\u201d The YouTube star Humza Arshad shouts the last two words with such force that pupils at Harris Academy jump, before roaring with laughter. It might seem an unlikely joke to make at a school workshop tackling violent crime and extremism, but that is precisely why Arshad is here: to break down the barriers that can prevent the message getting across. The actor-comedian\u2019s YouTube series Badman and the earlier Diary of a Bad Man have won him a huge youth following: he has had more than 100m views. For the past two weeks, with Metropolitan police counter-terrorism officers, he has visited 16 schools in eight London boroughs particularly affected by violent crime. At the final workshop, at Harris Academy in Peckham, he has the children \u2013 aged 11 to 15 \u2013 eating out of his hands with his jokes before moving on to more serious issues. \u201cI\u2019m from south London, so I know how dangerous it can be outside,\u201d the Streatham-born comedian, clad in woolly hat and big hooded coat, tells the audience of more than 200 children. He shares the story about how his friend Ch\u00e9 Morrison was stabbed to death last year in Ilford, east London. The silence is punctuated by the odd gasp as he tells them how the killers filmed his friend as he lay dying, and he ended up seeing the footage of Morrison\u2019s last breaths. Arshad admits to being a \u201cvery different person\u201d before he became a comedian. \u201cI don\u2019t like telling this story when the police are here,\u201d he says, to laughs, before recalling a story about an aborted revenge attack in his youth. The comedian says he was moved to speak to schoolchildren by Morrison\u2019s death, the New Zealand mosque attack, and increasing intolerance since the Brexit vote. He has also co-directed and acts in a short 12-minute film, Hate, shown at all the schools he has visited and launching on his YouTube channel on Monday. The film does not pull punches, depicting the cyclical nature of hate, and taking in gang violence, stabbings, shootings, acid attacks and extremism. It also addresses frustrations young people feel with the police, with Arshad\u2019s character bemoaning the fact his wife\u2019s attacker would probably have been caught \u201cif his skin was darker\u201d. Two counter-terrorism officers present at the Peckham workshop discuss some of the issues raised by the film, as well as the use of fake news to spread extremism, tactics used by gangs to coerce young people, and homophobia. There is palpable shock among the Harris Academy pupils when they pull up a photograph on the big screen of a smiling \u201cnormal\u201d 17-year-old, before revealing him to be Salman Abedi, who, five years later, detonated an explosive vest at an Ariane Grande concert in Manchester. Afterwards, pupils were full of praise for the workshop, and for Arshad in particular. Farhan Khan, 14, said the issues raised were pertinent given that an ex-student of the academy, Malcolm Mide-Madariola, was stabbed to death aged 17 in 2018. Khan said of Arshad: \u201cHe came out of this culture so it\u2019s more of a personal story. I\u2019d rather have someone being jokey about it rather than just serious.

These paragraphs didn\u2019t tell a story as such, but rather they worked upon the reader in an accretive and insidious fashion, building up a complex three-dimensional picture of the unnamed narrator\u2019s existence, caught between her maternal instincts and her dreams of being an \u201cart monster\u201d. <em>Dept of Speculation</em> played with the reader\u2019s expectations of the form, managing to be at once coyly withholding and painfully honest, overtly fictional but also gesturing towards the conventions of autobiography.</p> <p><em>Weather</em>, Offill\u2019s third novel, at first feels on familiar ground, telling the tale of Lizzie Benson, a mother and librarian in an unnamed New York borough who \u201cused to have plans! Biggish ones, medium at least.\u201d Lizzie attends meditation classes with a woman called Margot, although mostly \u201cthe people who take this meditation class just want to know if they should be vegetarians or, if they already are, how to convert others\u201d. Lizzie\u2019s husband, Ben, did a classics degree but now designs educational computer games; her son, Eli, asks her difficult questions and at the school gates she can\u2019t stop thinking about \u201chow big this school is or how small he is\u201d. Her brother, Henry, is in and out of Narcotics Anonymous, in a relationship with Catherine, \u201ca weird mix of hard-edged and hippie-minded\u201d.</p> <p>Lizzie is contacted by a former university professor, Sylvia, who \u201cused to check in on me sometimes to see if I was still squandering my promise\u201d. Sylvia has become a kind of celebrity through a podcast called Hell and High Water and is now on a \u201cnever-ending speaking tour\u201d. She plans to \u201crewild half the earth\u201d and is supported by Silicon Valley billionaires who want to \u201cde-extinct\u201d mammoths. Sylvia enlists Lizzie as a confidante, and they go on a series of journeys together \u2013 \u201cSylvia always wants to go see things, some nearby, some far away. The requirement is that they are disappearing faster than expected. The going, going, gone trips, I call them.\u201d Sylvia pays Lizzie to answer the emails she gets from the wild preppers who follow her and ask things like: \u201cWhat is surveillance capitalism? How can we save the bees? What is the internet of things? When will humans go extinct?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her sentences resonate powerfully, drawing you in with their humour before sideswiping you with their veracity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These apocalyptic correspondents seem to summon forth an analogous fear in Lizzie. She starts planning her own \u201cdoomstead\u201d, having heard that the tech billionaires are buying up land in New Zealand. She considers moving there, but is worried that \u201cthe government has restrictions about what you can name your kid. Sex Fruit and Fat Boy are forbidden. Violence and Number 16 Bus Shelter are okay.\u201d The weather of the title is partly the climate crisis: \u201cAccording to the current trajectory, New York City will begin to experience dramatic, life-altering temperatures by 2047.\u201d</p> <p>The title also refers to the prevailing atmosphere in the US, particularly after the election of Trump, which happens around halfway through the book. \u201cYour people have finally fallen into history,\u201d an Iranian friend tells her. Sylvia had predicted it: \u201cIn chaotic times, people long for a strongman, she said. But I didn\u2019t believe her. Hardly anyone did.\u201d Lizzie asks Will, a war reporter with whom she\u2019s contemplating having an affair, whether the US feels like a country at war. \u201cHe says it feels the way it does just before it starts. It\u2019s a weird thing, but you learn to pick up on it. Even while everybody\u2019s convincing themselves it\u2019s going to be okay, it\u2019s there in the air somehow. The whole thing is more physical than mental, he tells me.\u201d</p> <p>As with her previous novel, the paragraphs in <em>Weather</em> are each a kind of koan, some short, some long, all of them containing a piece of central, organising wisdom. Penelope Fitzgerald was the queen of the innocuously devastating aphorism; Offill has inherited her crown. Again and again her sentences resonate powerfully, drawing you in with their humour before sideswiping you with their veracity. At one point Lizzie tells us that she\u2019s \u201calways had an obsession with lost books, all the ones half written or recovered in pieces\u201d. She doesn\u2019t say why, but I think it\u2019s because these \u201chalf-written\u201d books require the participation of the reader to complete their story. In <em>Weather</em>, we construct a whole from the pieces Offill gives us, and find that we hold in our hands a truly remarkable novel, perhaps the most powerful portrait of Trump\u2019s America yet.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Weather</em> by Jenny Offill is published by Granta (\u00a312.99).

Lizzie is contacted by a former university professor, Sylvia, who \u201cused to check in on me sometimes to see if I was still squandering my promise\u201d. Sylvia has become a kind of celebrity through a podcast called Hell and High Water and is now on a \u201cnever-ending speaking tour\u201d. She plans to \u201crewild half the earth\u201d and is supported by Silicon Valley billionaires who want to \u201cde-extinct\u201d mammoths. Sylvia enlists Lizzie as a confidante, and they go on a series of journeys together \u2013 \u201cSylvia always wants to go see things, some nearby, some far away. The requirement is that they are disappearing faster than expected. The going, going, gone trips, I call them.\u201d Sylvia pays Lizzie to answer the emails she gets from the wild preppers who follow her and ask things like: \u201cWhat is surveillance capitalism? How can we save the bees? What is the internet of things? When will humans go extinct?\u201d These apocalyptic correspondents seem to summon forth an analogous fear in Lizzie. She starts planning her own \u201cdoomstead\u201d, having heard that the tech billionaires are buying up land in New Zealand. She considers moving there, but is worried that \u201cthe government has restrictions about what you can name your kid. Sex Fruit and Fat Boy are forbidden. Violence and Number 16 Bus Shelter are okay.\u201d The weather of the title is partly the climate crisis: \u201cAccording to the current trajectory, New York City will begin to experience dramatic, life-altering temperatures by 2047.\u201d The title also refers to the prevailing atmosphere in the US, particularly after the election of Trump, which happens around halfway through the book. \u201cYour people have finally fallen into history,\u201d an Iranian friend tells her. Sylvia had predicted it: \u201cIn chaotic times, people long for a strongman, she said. But I didn\u2019t believe her. Hardly anyone did.\u201d Lizzie asks Will, a war reporter with whom she\u2019s contemplating having an affair, whether the US feels like a country at war. \u201cHe says it feels the way it does just before it starts. It\u2019s a weird thing, but you learn to pick up on it. Even while everybody\u2019s convincing themselves it\u2019s going to be okay, it\u2019s there in the air somehow. The whole thing is more physical than mental, he tells me.\u201d As with her previous novel, the paragraphs in Weather are each a kind of koan, some short, some long, all of them containing a piece of central, organising wisdom. Penelope Fitzgerald was the queen of the innocuously devastating aphorism; Offill has inherited her crown. Again and again her sentences resonate powerfully, drawing you in with their humour before sideswiping you with their veracity. At one point Lizzie tells us that she\u2019s \u201calways had an obsession with lost books, all the ones half written or recovered in pieces\u201d. She doesn\u2019t say why, but I think it\u2019s because these \u201chalf-written\u201d books require the participation of the reader to complete their story. In Weather, we construct a whole from the pieces Offill gives us, and find that we hold in our hands a truly remarkable novel, perhaps the most powerful portrait of Trump\u2019s America yet. \u2022 Weather by Jenny Offill is published by Granta (\u00a312.99).

Malaysian imports of plastic waste from wealthy countries have risen dramatically since China, previously the world\u2019s biggest importer, imposed a ban in January 2018. EU law stipulates that member states can export plastic waste to non-EU countries only if it is recyclable, and that recycling companies must adhere to the environmental and technical standards required of treatment facilities in Europe. But lax controls at ports means a huge amount of contaminated and hard-to-recycle plastic is being shipped out of Europe and ending up in illegal factories. The investigation by a team of journalists at Greenpeace Italy found that of the 2,880 tonnes of plastic waste Italy exported to Malaysia between January and September last year, almost half was received by companies operating illegally.

As the institution comes under increasing pressure because of its public funding model, it is hard to communicate to those who have access to a good education, an assortment of entertainment options and the regular warmth of interaction with family and friends, how life-transforming a single radio station, or indeed a single radio show, can be.</p> <p>There is something uniquely edifying about the BBC, something companionable, a curiosity that feels inclusive rather than delivered from a distance, like a nerdy professor trying to make the material fun and easy to digest. This is only possible because of its public nature. It has the space to experiment and fail, but in the sum of its parts produce programmes that \u2013 for a small amount of money per viewer \u2013 entertain, educate and galvanise a nation.</p> <p>The World Service and its local language channels achieve a rare thing \u2013 free coverage of news events with a colour, detail and dedication absent from the media behemoths fixated on western current affairs. This combination of authority and striving for accessibility makes it what it is. To be a BBC listener or viewer doesn\u2019t feel like being a consumer, exchanging money for a product, it feels like being a partner, an owner of the material.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/09/observer-view-on-bbc-force-for-good\">The Observer view on the BBC: a force for good | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those who advocate for the elimination of public services, because of the rise and success of private providers that do something marginally similar, fail to understand that the BBC needs to remain a public service <em>because</em> there is more competition, not in spite of it. Competition creates a race to the bottom, cutting everything that doesn\u2019t cover its costs.</p> <p>I was exposed to a different BBC when I moved to the UK \u2013 a more inward looking but no less ambitious broadcaster than its World Service channels. Through it came a different education, an initiation into British pop culture, humour and debate. With that initiation came the more intimate relationship of being a licence fee-paying stakeholder. And so alongside the pleasure of being able to switch on the radio in the morning and listen, ad-free, to the prime minister being grilled on the Today programme, came a frustration with the tone of the debate about the future of the BBC, a despair at what had become a less thoughtful, more pugilistic debating culture. Some of this is a national sport, but it must be acknowledged that BBC-bashing comes not only from a place of ownership and affection but from privilege, and a fixation on the current affairs side of its output.</p> <p>Despite the BBC\u2019s undoubted failure <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/tommy-robinson-newsnight-bbc-reaction-506365\" title=\"\">to curate some news events responsibly</a>, as well as on equal pay and its propensity to recruit from Oxbridge, leading to an establishment world view, I have to remind myself that compared to subscription channels such as Sky, or streaming models such as Netflix, it has the highest penetration in UK homes, the lowest cost and the lowest barriers to access, not requiring a high-speed internet connection, a passed credit check for a long-term contract, or the installation of any equipment. There is someone, somewhere, not only in the UK but across the world, on a drive to work, or sitting alone at home facing a long day of silence, or playing with a dial at night to lift the heavy burden of the day, for whom the BBC is not only an amenity but a lifeline.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>",

As the institution comes under increasing pressure because of its public funding model, it is hard to communicate to those who have access to a good education, an assortment of entertainment options and the regular warmth of interaction with family and friends, how life-transforming a single radio station, or indeed a single radio show, can be. There is something uniquely edifying about the BBC, something companionable, a curiosity that feels inclusive rather than delivered from a distance, like a nerdy professor trying to make the material fun and easy to digest. This is only possible because of its public nature. It has the space to experiment and fail, but in the sum of its parts produce programmes that \u2013 for a small amount of money per viewer \u2013 entertain, educate and galvanise a nation. The World Service and its local language channels achieve a rare thing \u2013 free coverage of news events with a colour, detail and dedication absent from the media behemoths fixated on western current affairs. This combination of authority and striving for accessibility makes it what it is. To be a BBC listener or viewer doesn\u2019t feel like being a consumer, exchanging money for a product, it feels like being a partner, an owner of the material. Those who advocate for the elimination of public services, because of the rise and success of private providers that do something marginally similar, fail to understand that the BBC needs to remain a public service because there is more competition, not in spite of it. Competition creates a race to the bottom, cutting everything that doesn\u2019t cover its costs. I was exposed to a different BBC when I moved to the UK \u2013 a more inward looking but no less ambitious broadcaster than its World Service channels. Through it came a different education, an initiation into British pop culture, humour and debate. With that initiation came the more intimate relationship of being a licence fee-paying stakeholder. And so alongside the pleasure of being able to switch on the radio in the morning and listen, ad-free, to the prime minister being grilled on the Today programme, came a frustration with the tone of the debate about the future of the BBC, a despair at what had become a less thoughtful, more pugilistic debating culture. Some of this is a national sport, but it must be acknowledged that BBC-bashing comes not only from a place of ownership and affection but from privilege, and a fixation on the current affairs side of its output. Despite the BBC\u2019s undoubted failure to curate some news events responsibly, as well as on equal pay and its propensity to recruit from Oxbridge, leading to an establishment world view, I have to remind myself that compared to subscription channels such as Sky, or streaming models such as Netflix, it has the highest penetration in UK homes, the lowest cost and the lowest barriers to access, not requiring a high-speed internet connection, a passed credit check for a long-term contract, or the installation of any equipment. There is someone, somewhere, not only in the UK but across the world, on a drive to work, or sitting alone at home facing a long day of silence, or playing with a dial at night to lift the heavy burden of the day, for whom the BBC is not only an amenity but a lifeline. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Chris Rock on Jeff Bezos and Marriage Story \u201cBezos is so rich, he got divorced and he is still the richest man in the world. He saw Marriage Story and thought it was a comedy.\u201d Joaquin Phoenix \u2026 \u2026 on veganism and social justice \u201cI think at times we feel or are made to feel that we champion different causes. But for me I see commonality. I think whether we\u2019re talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights, or animal rights \u2013 we\u2019re talking about the fight against injustice.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender, one species has the right to dominate, use and control another with impunity.\u201d \u2026 on dairy products \u201cI think we\u2019ve become very disconnected from the natural world, many of us are guilty of an egocentric worldview and we believe that we\u2019re the centre of the universe. We go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources, we feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and steal her baby even though her cries of anguish are unmistakeable. Then we take her milk intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal.\u201d \u2026 on forgiveness \u201cI have been a scoundrel all my life, I\u2019ve been selfish. I\u2019ve been cruel at times, hard to work with and I\u2019m grateful that so many of you in this room have given me a second chance. I think that\u2019s when we\u2019re at our best: when we support each other. Not when we cancel each other out for our past mistakes, but when we help each other to grow. When we educate each other. When we guide each other to redemption.\u201d Laura Dern on meeting your heroes \u201cNoah [Baumbach] wrote a movie about love and breaching divisions in the name and the honour of family and home and hopefully for our planet. Some say never meet your heroes. I say if you\u2019re really blessed you get them as your parents. I share this with my acting legends Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern. You got game, I love you. Thank you all for this gift. This is the best birthday present ever.\u201d Taika Waititi on far-right extremism and indigenous kids Backstage: \u201cIf you were a Nazi, you would go to jail. Now you\u2019re a Nazi, feel free to have a rally down in the square with your mates.\u201d On stage he said: \u201cI want to dedicate this to all the indigenous kids in the world who want to do art, we are the original storytellers and we can make it here as well.\u201d Brad Pitt on Trump\u2019s impeachment, John Bolton and the Republican party \u201cThank you to the Academy for this honour of honours. They told me I only have 45 seconds up here which is 45 more than the Senate gave John Bolton.\u201d Bong Joon-Ho on booze and Scorsese and Tarantino \u201cThe [international feature film] category has a new name and I\u2019m so happy to be its first recipient under its new name. I applaud and support the new direction that this change symbolises. I\u2019m ready to drink tonight. \u201cWhen I was young and starting in cinema there was a saying that I carved deep into my heart, which is, \u2018The most personal is the most creative.\u2019 That quote was from our great Martin Scorsese. When I was in school I studied Scorsese\u2019s films. Just to be nominated was a huge honour, I never felt I would win. When people in the US were not familiar with my films Quentin [Tarantino] would always put my films on his list \u2013 Quentin, I love you.\u201d Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir on female composers \u201cTo the girls to the women, to the mothers to the daughters who hear the music bubbling within please speak up \u2013 we need to hear your voices.\u201d Sigourney Weaver, Gal Gadot and Brie Larson\u2019s Fight Club \u201cWe decided that after the show we\u2019re going to start a fight club. Men are invited but no shirts allowed. The winner will get a lifetime\u2019s supply of deodorant, sushi, and tequila. The loser gets a lifetime of questions about what it\u2019s like as a woman in Hollywood. Ford v Ferrari sound editor Donald Sylvester on sharing \u201cIf I could I would break this off [statuette] and give James [Mangold] the head so he could put it in a jar.\u201d Hair Love\u2019s directors on \u2026 hair Matthew A Cherry and Karen Rupert Toliver said their film Hair Love, which won for best animated short, was made because they \u201cwanted to normalise black hair\u201d and make cartoons more diverse. The directors invited black teenager Deandre Arnold, who was told he wouldn\u2019t be able to take part in his graduation if he didn\u2019t cut his dreadlocks, as their guest. \u201cWe have a firm belief that representation matters deeply, especially in cartoons because in cartoons that\u2019s how we first see our movies and think about how we shape the world,\u201d said Karen Rupert Toliver.",

Phoenix was the overwhelming favourite, seeing off competition from the likes of Marriage Story\u2019s Adam Driver and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\u2019s Leonardo DiCaprio.</p> <p>Joker, directed by Todd Phillips, is an origin story for the celebrated supervillain, previously played most famously on screen by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger.

He had previously received two best actor nominations at the Oscars for Walk the Line in 2006 and The Master in 2013, but this is his first win.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/joaquin-phoenixs-oscars-speech-in-full\">a lengthy acceptance speech</a>, Phoenix made an impassioned plea for human beings to stop fighting each other and to stop plundering our natural resources, placing particular emphasis on the cruelty involved in industrial dairy farming.</p> <p>He closed his emotional address by quoting a lyric written, aged 17, by his late brother, River: \u201cRun to the rescue with love and peace will follow.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Joker star Joaquin Phoenix has won the best actor Oscar at the 92nd Academy Awards, for his performance as Batman\u2019s nemesis. Phoenix was the overwhelming favourite, seeing off competition from the likes of Marriage Story\u2019s Adam Driver and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\u2019s Leonardo DiCaprio. Joker, directed by Todd Phillips, is an origin story for the celebrated supervillain, previously played most famously on screen by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Phoenix\u2019s version is an aspiring standup comic who has a disorder that causes him to burst into uncontrollable laughter at inappropriate moments, and who is obsessed with a talkshow host played by Robert De Niro. Phoenix has made a virtual clean sweep of major awards for the role, winning best actor at the Baftas, the Critics\u2019 Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and best actor in a drama at the Golden Globes. He had previously received two best actor nominations at the Oscars for Walk the Line in 2006 and The Master in 2013, but this is his first win. In a lengthy acceptance speech, Phoenix made an impassioned plea for human beings to stop fighting each other and to stop plundering our natural resources, placing particular emphasis on the cruelty involved in industrial dairy farming. He closed his emotional address by quoting a lyric written, aged 17, by his late brother, River: \u201cRun to the rescue with love and peace will follow.\u201d",

Hooray for the good taste of Hollywood. Best picture, best director and best international feature have gone to a movie that really deserves it, a film from beyond the Los Angeles parish pump. Bong Joon-ho\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho-south-korean-satire\">Parasite</a> from South Korea is the stunningly clever and powerful upstairs-downstairs satire of a predatory family moving into a wealthy household, and in so doing revealing the dual dysfunction of both the master and servant family groups and the unhappiness of wider society, disclosing a new 21st-century serfdom.</p> \n<p>I admit that on a purely subjective level, I had been rooting for Martin Scorsese\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/the-irishman-review-martin-scorseses-finest-film-for-30-years\">The Irishman</a>, which sadly went home with nothing. I also thought it was odd that the awards establishment was behaving as if Parasite was the only foreign-language movie worthy of praise, overlooking films like Wang Xiaoshuai\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/04/so-long-my-son-review-china-film-drama-wang-xiaoshai\">So Long, My Son</a> and Kantemir Balagovs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/11/beanpole-review-kantemir-balagov-leningrad-war\">Beanpole</a>.</p> \n<p>But who could possibly complain about this? The victory for Parasite is the first time a foreign-language film has won best picture and the first time since Marty in 1955 that the winner of the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes has gone on to win best picture at the Oscars. On his victory tour of awards ceremonies leading up to this, Bong had playfully told audiences: \u201cOnce you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.\u201d The Academy just hopped over that barrier, catching up with audiences who have long shown that it isn\u2019t too high a hurdle: Parasite is doing some gangbusters business, especially in the UK.</p> \n<p>Perhaps it is telling that the film has done so well in the anglophone world. Here is a movie that launches its fierce satirical missile at class and makes clearthat the issue hasn\u2019t gone away. It is still a live-wire subject. Bong Joon-ho\u2019s film is about inequality, the toxic injustice that builds pain into the household of the state.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57a5d8d0e1add2a8aafa692c6df2e4f8231601cf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57a5d8d0e1add2a8aafa692c6df2e4f8231601cf/0_106_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A thoroughly satisfying winner\u2019 \u2026 Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A thoroughly satisfying winner\u2019 \u2026 Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Cooper/Allstar/Columbia Pictures</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Joaquin Phoenix got his widely anticipated best actor Oscar for Todd Phillips\u2019 supervillain origin story Joker.

      "bodyText": "Greater Sydney dam levels were at 64.2% on Monday morning, up from 41.9% in seven days, with Warragamba Dam sitting at 60.7% at 10.30am. The ash and debris generated by recent bushfires around the Warragamba area will not affect water quality, and two silt curtains are in place to intercept ash run-off, WaterNSW said. Prospect Dam is more than 90% full, and Woronora Dam in Sydney\u2019s south is almost 60% full, jumping 25 percentage points. The NSW Rural Fire Service said the following fires that have ravaged the state\u2019s east are out: Gospers Mountain, Myall Creek Road, Erskine Creek, Kerry Ridge, Green Wattle Creek, Morton and Currrowan. And the ABC is reporting all fires in NSW could be out by the end of the week. Up to 25 metres of beach at Collaroy and Narrabeen has been swept away by huge waves generated by the east coast low. While properties along the beach have been spared serious damage today, the threat is expected to return in coming days when more storms are forecast. Flash flooding remains a possibility in several NSW regions, including Sydney. The SES issued the all clear for Narrabeen lagoon at 10.30am but there are a number of spots around Sydney that have flood evacuation orderss. Check the SES website for details. Ausgrid crews are continuing to deal with 3,100 hazards, including fallen powerlines, fallen trees, damaged wires and extensive flash flooding. The company has restored power to 61,000 customers and is continuing efforts to reconnect 79,000 still without power. The Warragamba Dam recouped a year\u2019s worth of water in one weekend, rising 17.7 percentage points to sit at 60.7% at 10.30am on Monday, AAP reports. Some 360,000 megalitres of water flowed into the dam, almost as much as 150,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. Here\u2019s a before and after comparison created by my colleague Patrick Lum: My Guardian Australia colleague Amaani Siddeek has been looking into the effects of the storm on parts of Sydney that are at risk from coastal erosion. Up to 25 metres of beach at Collaroy and Narrabeen has been swept away by huge waves generated by the east coast low that brought a deluge to Sydney at the weekend. The storm weather brought \u2018abnormally high tides\u2019 and strong winds and the city\u2019s heaviest rainfall in up to two decades, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Drone footage showed waves sweeping up to the foot of houses along the beach where a similar storm in 2016 destroyed a private swimming pool and caused serious erosion. A coastal researcher, Prof Mitchell Harley, from the University of New South Wales, said properties along the beach had been spared serious damage on Monday but the threat would resume in coming days when more storms were forecast. You can read the full report from Amaani below. The SES issued the all clear for Narrabeen lagoon at 10.30am but there are a number of locations around Sydney that still have flood evacuation orders in place. They include: Bankstown aerodrome, East Hills, Holsworthy, Picnic Point, Pleasure Point, Sandy Point, Milperra, Moorebank, Chipping Norton, Hawkesbury River at North Richmond lowlands, Pitt Town Bottoms area and Gronos Point area. You can find more details about the specific streets affected here. Here\u2019s another view of the enormous amount of water that has flowed into Lake Conjola on the south coast of New South Wales in the past 48 hours. Amazing news. A list of some of those huge fires that have been extinguished since the weekend. Update: In what will be very welcome news, the ABC is reporting all fires in NSW could be extinguished by the end of the week. Guardian Australia has contacted the NSW RFS and the NSW government for confirmation. Allow extra driving time if you\u2019re travelling north on the M7. Another flood warning for the NSW Central Coast A severe thunderstorm warning has been issued for heavy rainfall and damaging winds. 89,000 people are still without power in NSW. And here\u2019s why it\u2019s gone out. Some phenomenal news. The Gospers Mountain mega-fire, which at its peak was the largest fire in Australia, has been put out by the weekend\u2019s immense rain, the RFS says. The fire, near the Blue Mountains, was 512,626ha \u2013 which is larger than Long Island and Manhattan combined. It of course leaves a lot of devastation behind. An RFS spokesman, James Morris, told the ABC the fire was \u201cofficially set to \u2018out\u2019 this morning around 8.20am due to significant rainfall\u201d. And it has now been removed from the RFS Fires Near Me app. There is also a severe thunderstorm warning for large parts of Queensland, and two more flood warnings, one for the Clarence River at Grafton, and one for the Hawkesbury, Nepean and Colo rivers. And a warning for the Bega River. A flood warning has just been issued for the Moryua and Deua rivers on the south coast. Moderate flooding is forecast for Wamban. An important update on a story we brought you earlier. A reader has informed us that a huge tree that fell over in the Sydney CBD was in fact planted by the Queen. The tree, near the corner of Bridge and Loftus streets, was planted by the Queen on her first visit to Australia in 1954. This story from the ABC shows an archival image of a very young queen and a very young tree. Another tree next to it, planted by Prince Philip, is still upright. In Queensland, the drought-hit town of Dalby has spent Monday recovering from a suprise flood at the weekend. AAP reported: Myall Creek, which runs through the centre of Dalby, rose to a height of 3.1 metres on Sunday morning, well above the flood height mark of about two metres. Dalby is accustomed to flooding; the most recent flood which caused major damage was in 2011. Minor damage was recorded at a few properties along the creek on Sunday, and many residents were unprepared because the flood came so fast. Vicki Gibbs, a director at Southey\u2019s Mechanical, said residents were caught off guard because floodwaters did not follow the usual route to Dalby. \u201cThe waters came from Bell and Kaimkillenbun rather than the Bunya Mountains \u2013 not the normal route,\u201d she said. \u201cYou usually have 12 hours\u2019 [notice] if it comes from the Bunyas but this happened rapidly.\u201d Nev Volker, who owns a cafe in Dalby\u2019s main street, said he had no choice but to stay closed because none of his staff could get to work. \u201cI know some places opened but the middle of town was just empty because no one could get there, or they were watching for the flood warnings,\u201d he said. Hi all, this is Naaman Zhou taking over from Calla Wahlquist. In proof that the job never ends, the NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, has tweeted praise of fire crews who have been out helping the SES. As he says, the wild weather means \u201ca quick change of role from firefighting to storm and flood damage\u201d. While people on the NSW south coast are undoubtedly happy to get some rain to finally extinguish those bushfires, it must be devastating to have begun cleaning up after one natural disaster and then immediately be hit by another. The wildlife also needs the water; really doesn\u2019t need the flood. It\u2019s raining in Canberra, but the Orroral Valley fire is still going A big dumping of rain has failed to extinguish the bushfire burning on the outskirts of Canberra, AAP reports. More than 60mm fell on the national capital in the 24 hours to 9am Monday. But the Orroral Valley fire, which has burned almost 90,000ha in two weeks, remains at advice-level warning as crews try to bring it under control. It was, however, enough for the ACT to lift its state of alert. Canberra residents complained on Sunday that the rain radar appeared to show clouds avoiding the city. Not any more. Do you remember this image taken by Australian photographer Matt Abbott for the New York Times at Lake Conjola on New Year\u2019s Eve? It went around the world and became a symbol of the bushfire crisis. Well, there\u2019s been an update. The water level in Warragamba Dam, the main water supply for Sydney, has increased by almost 20 percentage points in 24 hours, my colleague Naaman Zhou reports. On Sunday morning Warragamba was 43.8% full. On Monday morning it was at 61.8%. That\u2019s 363,681ML flowing into Warragamba alone. Across the whole of Sydney\u2019s catchment area, 512,452ML flowed into dams. More on that here: Here are some more images from Collaroy, in Sydney\u2019s northern beaches, this morning. Is this rain drought-breaking? Jane Golding was asked if the rain was enough to be considered drought-breaking. The short answer is: not yet. Here\u2019s the long answer: We have seen some good falls on the western side of the divide as well ... We have heard that it\u2019s very welcome out that way. Some locations have seen upwards of 100mm over the past few days and more rain than they have seen in quite a few years \u2013 four or five years ... I know that some farmers out that way are feeling pretty optimistic. But what we really need is follow-up rain. The rainfall deficiency is so severe that the soil is dry to deep levels, so we really need that follow-up rain. We do look like we\u2019ll get some pretty beefy thunderstorms out that way today and tomorrow, so that will deliver more rain. But it\u2019s over the next month or so that we need that follow-up. Golding said NSW can expect thunderstorms every day for the next week, and those storms will be accompanied by heavy localised rain. The BoM\u2019s Jane Golding also said the risk of coastal erosion would continue tomorrow, with another high tide forecast. Sydney has experienced king tides and swells of 5m for two days, causing coastal inundation and erosion. Tomorrow\u2019s high tide could cause further inundation and localised flooding, she says. NSW police issued a further warning to people not to drive or walk into flood waters, enter rough seas, or go too close to flooded drains. Assistant commissioner Karen Webb said emergency services spent yesterday and last night rescuing people who did not heed those warnings. Across the weekend we\u2019ve had people driving into, walking into flooded roadways and water courses which has required rescue. We\u2019ve had people enter surf where it\u2019s been unsafe and had to be rescued from that, and also drains. We\u2019ve had a 13-year-old boy on the north shore who went near a drain and had to be rescued and taken to hospital. Flood waters in suburban and metropolitan areas are still flood waters: don\u2019t enter them. On the subject of landslips Howard Collins, the chief operating officer of Transport NSW, said the Blue Mountains line west of Springwood, all the way to Bathurst, would be out for \u201ca number of days, if not longer\u201d because of a \u201cvery significant\u201d landslip at Leura. Collins said it had been \u201ca tough 24 hours\u201d and that although major arterial roads in Sydney and surrounds were open, there were still closures in some local roads. Public transport heading north, south and west out of Sydney has been affected, and there\u2019s also some flooding to train tunnels in Sydney. He asked people to avoid driving wherever possible. If you don\u2019t have to be on the road, don\u2019t travel. The rain is moving south and falling over bushfire grounds on the NSW south coast. It will be for the Rural Fire Service to confirm, the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s Jane Golding says, but that rain is falling over fire grounds in volumes sufficient to put fires out. She says: It\u2019s a good news story. We\u2019re extinguishing fires. The south coast has received between 100mm and 150mm in the past 12 to 18 hours. Within the next two hours or so the rain will cross over to Victoria, where it\u2019s forecast to fall in similar volumes on fire grounds around Mallacoota and the Cann river. There are some flood warnings in place for the NSW south coast and East Gippsland in Victoria. Golding said she has not received any reports of landslips on the south coast, but it is possible. The slopes are certainly vulnerable enough and what we\u2019ve seen around the Blue Mountains has showed that that has happened. Sydney has had most rain in one stretch since 1990: BoM The Bureau of Meteorology just updated the rain and floods situation in NSW, together with emergency services. The BoM\u2019s manager of NSW/ACT weather services, Jane Golding, said some coastal areas in the Illawarra have received almost 700mm of rain since Wednesday. That is a lot of rain. The highest totals were at Robertson in the Illawarra, which has recorded 698mm since Wednesday, of which 500mm fell at the weekend. Brogers Creek, also in the Illawarra, \u201cwas not far behind\u201d. Pottsville, which is on the coast in the northern rivers region, recorded 605mm since Wednesday, and parts of the central tablelands recorded 631mm since Wednesday. Sydney received between 200mm and 300mm of rain at the weekend. Again, that is a very lot of rain. Says Golding: A preliminary look at those rainfall numbers suggest that they\u2019ve been the highest multi-day figures for the Sydney area since February 1990 when we had ex-tropical cyclone Nancy move over the region. Warnings in place for WA fires Moving off floods briefly: a watch and act alert remains in place for a fire near Ravensthorpe in south-eastern WA. The fire was first reported on Thursday and was started by a lightning strike, the WA fire and emergency services department said. It has burned through almost 180,000ha. Another watch and act alert is in place for a separate fire a bit further north, near Holleton. That fire was also started by lightning on Thursday and is 82,000ha. A third fire which destroyed one house and damaged two others at Katanning is listed as advice level. It was first reported on Friday and its cause is unknown. It\u2019s substantially smaller \u2013 just 4,600ha \u2013 but it\u2019s in farmland. The Insurance Council has declared the east coast storms and flooding a catastrophe. It is the sixth catastrophe to be declared in Australia in the past five months. Because, again, we are in a climate emergency. This particular catastrophe dates back to 5 February. As of 7am, insurers have received 10,000 claims with an estimated total value of $45m. Most of the claims are for property damage caused by storm runoff, flooding, strong winds and heavy rain. Here\u2019s the Insurance Council of Australia\u2019s head of risk and operations, Karl Sullivan: Insurers expect a large number of claims will be lodged over the next 48 hours as property owners inspect the damage to homes and businesses and contact their insurers. It\u2019s likely many householders are unable to contact their insurers due to telecommunications and power interruptions, but insurers are standing by to help. So far most of the claims are from south-east Queensland and along New South Wales coastal regions, but damage has also been reported several hundred kilometres inland and in the ACT. The catastrophe declaration means claims will be given priority by insurers. Sullivan said insurers were also monitoring the extent of damage in the Pilbara in Western Australia from tropical cyclone Damien, but that hasn\u2019t been declared a catastrophe. The other five catastrophes were: NSW and Queensland bushfires in September: 437 claims, worth $37m. Fires in Rappville, NSW in October: 255 claims, insured losses of $19m. The summer bushfire season in NSW, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia: more than 20,000 claims, losses of $1.65bn logged from November to February. November hailstorms in south-east Queensland: 22,000 claims, losses of $166m January hailstorms in Canberra, Victoria and NSW: 69,850 claims, worth $638m Bushfire-affected areas of the NSW south coast are also copping it. This was Lake Conjola 39 days ago. And here it is today. The same volunteers who protected homes and lives during the fires are out again, this time trying to defend against floods. The advice for both situations is the same: pay attention to the warnings, prepare your house and stay off the roads. Awaiting next month\u2019s image of this soggy RFS sign surrounded by a plague of locusts. Flood warning for East Gippsland Let\u2019s look further south now, to East Gippsland, where bushfire-affected communities are now facing the risk of flooding. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a warning this morning for the eastern corner of the state around Mallacoota, Cann River, Chandlers Creek and Combienbar \u2013 all areas directly impacted by bushfire in the past month. The low-pressure system that caused flooding from Queensland down to Sydney is heading south, and is expected to dump between 25mm and 60mm of rain, with localised falls of up to 100mm of rain, today. Because these areas have been stripped of their ground cover, there is also a risk of landslides. The State Emergency Service has warned that waterways could be filled with ash, soil, rocks and trees, and that \u201cin areas recently affected by fires, heavy rainfall increases the potential for landslides and debris across roads\u201d. Parts of East Gippsland around Bairnsdale and Buchan have already received a significant amount of rain following the fires, with more than 100mm falling over the past month in some areas. Mallacoota and surrounds missed most of that rain. On a positive note, it could help put out or significantly quell bushfires that, because of the topography of Gippsland, can\u2019t be reached by firefighters. As of Monday morning, the main fire in the area, the 650,000ha Snowy River Complex, still had a number of hot spots that were creating smoke in the area but was not creating an immediate threat to the community. The Mallacoota fire complex, also known as the border fire, is still burning and is not yet under control, but it\u2019s also not posing a threat to communities at this stage. Continuing the theme of disgusting sea foam, take a look at Cronulla beach right now. This gloopy nonsense happens when you get churning waters (from, say, a storm causing 5-metre waves) in a body of water with higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter. The effect of that churning water hitting the beach is kind of like whipping egg whites, with similar but less pavlova-friendly results. Don\u2019t play in the sea foam, folks. It\u2019s Calla Wahlquist here, taking over from my colleague Josh Taylor. Let\u2019s check back in with Collaroy, where the combination of a king tide and big seas is causing coastal erosion \u2013 again. Collaroy and neighbouring Narrabeen Beach in Sydney\u2019s northern beaches were among the worst affected by coastal erosion in Sydney\u2019s last big rain event in June 2016. We won\u2019t be able to see how bad the damage is until the sea recedes, but it doesn\u2019t look good. The sea foam looks decidedly unpleasant. King tides, coastal inundation and regular garden-variety flooding are all predicted to occur with more frequency under global heating. The Bureau of Meterology says the 391.6mm of rain that has fallen over Sydney in the past four days is the most since the 414.2mm fell between February 2 and 5 in 1990. Before that it was 452.8mm over four days in August 1986, and 421.8mm over four days in November 1984. More on that missing driver at Galston Gorge. NSW Police say the silver Mercedes was seen being swept away between 4.30pm and 5pm on Sallaway Road. Police divers tried to look last night, but were not able to complete a full underwater search due to the conditions. Another operation will happen once conditions ease. Ausgrid says there are still around 110,000 homes without power across Sydney, the Central Coast and parts of Newcastle, after power was restored for 30,000 homes yesterday. Hunters Hill also had power restored this morning. There are still fallen power lines, power poles and fallen trees to deal with in order to restore power, and Ausgrid says it could be a number of days before power is restored for everyone. On the Orroral Valley fire in the ACT, emergency services there say the rainfall will not extinguish the fire, but the rain and cooler temperatures will help fire suppression efforts. The Queensland town of Stanthorpe, which has had such little water in the drought that it had begun having water trucked in, had about a month\u2019s worth of rain over the past few days. Stanthorpe could get around 15mm of rain today, but according to AAP, Southern Downs mayor Tracy Dobie says the town would need six months\u2019 worth of water to flow into the Storm King dam in order for the water trucking to stop. I am waiting to get data from Water NSW on what the massive amount of rain means for the state\u2019s dam levels, but here\u2019s an indication of just how much we think has filled Warragamba. Commuter chaos, as they say. Some people are very excited to see this much rain. Here\u2019s a snapshot of just how much rain has fallen in parts of New South Wales since 9am yesterday: Sydney, Observatory Hill \u2013 176mm Sydney airport \u2013 162mm Sydney Olympic Park \u2013 191mm Badgerys Creek \u2013 200mm Bankstown \u2013 159mm Campbelltown \u2013 172mm Holsworthy \u2013 224mm Penrith \u2013 112mm Dozens of schools are closed across New South Wales today as a safety measure in the wake of the floods and torrential rains, including over a dozen independent schools, and seven Catholic schools. You can find a list of the schools affected here. Meanwhile in Victoria, there is a forecast for heavy rainfall in the East Gippsland district, including Mallacoota. It is hoped that this rainfall will put out fires still going in Gippsland. There are currently 65 flood warnings for people driving around New South Wales today, according to Live Traffic. Here\u2019s a sample of the road closures today: Henry Lawson Dr between Padstow Heights and Milperra Great Western Hwy in St Marys between Pages Rd and Gipps Rd Hoxton Park Rd at Hoxton Park between First Ave and Lyn Pde Newbridge Rd in Chipping Norton between Governor Macquarie Dr and Henry Lawson Dr Heathcote Rd from Holsworthy to Lucas Heights Barrier Hwy 20km east of Cobar Hume Hwy between The Horsley Dr and Sappho Rd in Carramar Old Port Rd between Foreshore and Christy Dr in Port Kembla As expected, there are major delays on the Western line and the North Shore line. NSW SES assistant commissioner Paul Bailey says there were 2,695 jobs they had to respond to overnight, bringing it up to 10,000 jobs since Friday. He said there were 200 flood rescues, mainly caused by people driving into floodwaters. \u201cWe see people continually trying to do that. We are really concerned that people continue to try, so we are really asking people to reconsider driving through any floodwaters,\u201d he told ABC News Breakfast. He said one car was washed off a causeway in Galston Gorge and the driver is yet to be found. Police divers are currently searching for the driver. He said the rain should ease in Sydney over the next couple of hours to allow them to get on top of the jobs outstanding. A lot of people travelling in to work today will see a lot of the carnage the torrential rains and winds have brought across Sydney. Here\u2019s a sample. Police assistant commissioner Karen Webb was on Nine\u2019s Today Show this morning and she said there\u2019s been a few cases of people driving into flood waters and needing to be rescued, including a couple in their 80s, a 17-year-old boy, and a few fishermen. She said it was taking away police resources that could be used elsewhere, and urged people to heed the warnings. Trains are going to be a major issue in Sydney this morning due to land slips. Buses are replacing trains in the Blue Mountains between Springwood, Lithgow and Bathurst after a landslide at Leura. The Southern Highlands rail line has been suspended until 9am this morning. Good morning and welcome to Monday. Flood conditions are expected to continue in New South Wales and parts of Queensland today, with thousands still without power, dozens of schools closed, and power out for over 100,000 homes. A severe weather warning issued for the entire coast of NSW on Sunday remains in effect today. Sydney, the Central Coast and the Blue Mountains were soaked by between 200 and 400mm of rain between Friday morning and Sunday afternoon. It is the most amount of rainfall Sydney has experienced since around 1998, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. There is expected to be heavy rains, strong winds and damaging surf on the coast. Torrential rain could lead to flash flooding in parts of Sydney, Illawarra and the central tablelands. The NSW state emergency service has ordered the evacuation of residents along the Hawkesbury and Georges rivers. Authorities have advised residents in Sydney to stay home if they can, or keep an eye on public transport apps to check for any disruptions likely to occur because of the weather. Up to 150,000 homes were without power across parts of Sydney, the Central Coast, Newcastle and the Hunter region as of Sunday night, after rain and wind brought down power poles. NSW SES had responded to around 10,000 calls for help.",

Its many squares are host to an interesting history: the neighbourhood gained its name from the former Greek city of Smyrna, now Izmir, from where refugees settled the area in the 1920s. Car-free Nea Smyrni Square is at the neighbourhood\u2019s heart and is spectacular, with fountains, shops, restaurants, trendy cafes and bars to suit all ages, trends and budgets. With a plethora of outdoor entertainment during the summer, it\u2019s a real find not on the typical tourist route. Venture beyond the square and you\u2019ll find Nea Smyrni Alsos park, a large green oasis with aleppo pines, cypress and stone pines and good for strolling.

You swap gilded spires, cobbled backstreets and tourists for peaceful tree-lined avenues and a masterclass in socialist realism. The Nowa Huta museum in the monumental former theatre documents the area\u2019s short, action-packed history: \u201ca job for everyone\u201d in 1954 through the rise of Solidarity in the Lenin steelworks to the downfall of communism. That wasn\u2019t in the Soviet master plan, but thanks for the parks and affordable housing! Martin Charlesworth \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie, Wroc\u0142aw The district of \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie, or downtown, is a swath of land above Wroc\u0142aw\u2019s old town. To its east are the brutalist grandeur of Wroc\u0142awski Manhattan, the smattering of bars and restaurants around the university buildings (my favourite restaurant, once you get past the decor, is Warzywniak, which caters for vegans) and the culture centre at the Unesco heritage-listed Centennial Hall, surrounded by one of the finest urban green spaces in Poland. But what really makes the area a cut above the bars and architecture elsewhere in the city (and \u015awidnickie is a really honourable mention for its nightlife) are the cycle paths along the River Oder, wonderful in the summer.

Paula Kaanders Vallecas, Madrid Two stops beyond Madrid\u2019s Atocha station in the south-east of the capital lies the sprawling barrio of Vallecas. A trip here will return you to an authentically Madrile\u00f1o experience and the Madrid of yesteryear.

After an attempt to kill herself, she is sent from England to live in Australia with her daughter Kate (Frances O\u2019Connor), a decidedly anti-euthanasia doctor.

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Monday morning.</p> \n<p>Sinn F\u00e9in is celebrating what looks like being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/sinn-fein-to-try-to-form-ruling-coalition-after-irish-election-success\">a remarkable upset victory in the Irish election</a> that could see the former political wing of the IRA form a government in the republic. With 96% of first-preference votes counted last night, Sinn F\u00e9in had 24.1%, with Fianna F\u00e1il on 22.1%, Fine Gael on 22.1% and Greens on 7.4%. The party\u2019s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, told a raucous gathering of supporters in Dublin that they had witnessed a \u201crevolution\u201d and that Ireland no longer had a two-party system. She added that she would try to form a coalition with the Greens and some small leftwing parties but did not rule out talks with Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, the two established parties that have ruled Ireland between them for nearly 100 years. Gerry Adams, who stepped down as party leader in 2018, said Sinn F\u00e9in would use its mandate to plan for its defining goal, a united Ireland. The final allocation of seats in the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann might not be known until later today or tomorrow.</p> \n<p>Our Ireland correspondent, Rory Carroll, examines how Sinn F\u00e9in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/irish-voters-have-made-sinn-fein-mainstream-election\">rode a wave of voter anger</a> about homelessness, high cost of living and disillusion with the traditional parties to spring what was a surprise result.

The bad weather is forecast to continue today with blizzards expected in Northern Ireland and most of Scotland along with 20cm of snow. There is also a snow and ice warning in place for north-west England for today and tomorrow with the unsettled weather likely to cause delays on morning commutes today due to blocked roads and cancellations of flights and train services. The main line between Manchester and Scotland was closed and Network Rail said engineers would work through the night to assess the damage.

In China, where the death toll from the outbreak has jumped to 908 with 40,000 cases, authorities began to oversee a partial return to work for millions of people furloughed last week in an attempt to contain the contagion.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Sinn F\u00e9in aims to form coalition with Greens Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Monday morning. Sinn F\u00e9in is celebrating what looks like being a remarkable upset victory in the Irish election that could see the former political wing of the IRA form a government in the republic. With 96% of first-preference votes counted last night, Sinn F\u00e9in had 24.1%, with Fianna F\u00e1il on 22.1%, Fine Gael on 22.1% and Greens on 7.4%. The party\u2019s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, told a raucous gathering of supporters in Dublin that they had witnessed a \u201crevolution\u201d and that Ireland no longer had a two-party system. She added that she would try to form a coalition with the Greens and some small leftwing parties but did not rule out talks with Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, the two established parties that have ruled Ireland between them for nearly 100 years. Gerry Adams, who stepped down as party leader in 2018, said Sinn F\u00e9in would use its mandate to plan for its defining goal, a united Ireland. The final allocation of seats in the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann might not be known until later today or tomorrow. Our Ireland correspondent, Rory Carroll, examines how Sinn F\u00e9in rode a wave of voter anger about homelessness, high cost of living and disillusion with the traditional parties to spring what was a surprise result. You can also read his profile of McDonald here. * * * Ciara chaos \u2013 Britain is facing widespread disruption this morning after Storm Ciara battered large areas of the country, leaving flooding, power cuts and major disruptions to transport in its wake. The bad weather is forecast to continue today with blizzards expected in Northern Ireland and most of Scotland along with 20cm of snow. There is also a snow and ice warning in place for north-west England for today and tomorrow with the unsettled weather likely to cause delays on morning commutes today due to blocked roads and cancellations of flights and train services. The main line between Manchester and Scotland was closed and Network Rail said engineers would work through the night to assess the damage. The storm dumped a month and a half\u2019s rainfall on some areas in just 24 hours and also brought gusts of more than 90 miles per hour. Check out or picture gallery on the storm here, or watch this video of Britain being battered by Ciara. * * * Korea high \u2013 The 2020 Oscars belonged to Parasite, the Korean film that has become the first foreign language film to win the best picture award. Not only that, the film\u2019s director, Bong Joon-ho, won the prestigious best director prize, and the movie also picked up the statuette for best original screenplay and best international film. The black comedy saw off big-name opposition from Sam Mendes\u2019s 1917 and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, although the latter did win some recognition when Brad Pitt took home best supporting actor. Laura Dern won best supporting actress for Marriage Story. Joaquin Phoenix won best actor for The Joker and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger triumphed for her portrayal of Judy Garland in Judy. You can read a full list of winners here and get up to date with the red carpet action here. * * * Virus warning \u2013 Sixty new cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed on the cruise ship docked off Yokohama in Japan. It brings the number of infections on board the Diamond Princess to 130. The head of the World Health Organization says \u201cwe may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg\u201d with regards to the spread of the coronavirus. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who dispatched a team of experts to China today, said there were \u201csome concerning instances\u201d of the virus\u2019s spread from people with no travel history to China. In China, where the death toll from the outbreak has jumped to 908 with 40,000 cases, authorities began to oversee a partial return to work for millions of people furloughed last week in an attempt to contain the contagion. Concern is growing, however, for a citizen journalist, Chen Quishi, who has been posting regular updates on the outbreak from Wuhan but has been missing since Thursday. Follow the latest developments at our live blog here. And our economics writer, Phillip Inman, has taken an in-depth look at whether the virus can derail the global economy. * * * Windrush worsens \u2013 The number of people wrongly designated as illegal immigrants in the Windrush scandal could be many times higher than originally believed, with thousands still to come forward. MPs will debate the issue in the Commons today amid growing concern about the slow pace of compensation payments to victims. Only \u00a362,198 has been paid out to 36 people from a Home Office fund set up to pay out up to \u00a3750m. So far 1,108 people have applied, as many as 15,000 could be eligible. Also today, dozens of Jamaican-born immigrants are mounting a last-minute bid to block their deportation on a chartered flight set to leave the UK tomorrow. * * * Fox lobby \u2013 Liam Fox lobbied the Bahraini royal family to give a \u00a35bn oil contract to a company owned by a Tory donor which is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office for bribery and money laundering. Fox\u2019s intervention, which came when he was international trade secretary, was one of several attempts by senior party figures to win support for Petrofac, which is controlled by Ayman Asfari. He and his wife donated almost \u00a3800,000 to the Conservative party between 2009 and 2017 in a personal capacity. Today in Focus podcast Peter Mandelson and Steve Howell represent the two opposite poles of the Labour party: one was a key architect of Blairism, the other of Corbynism. But they started out as inseparable friends at the same school in north London. Now their focus is on what comes next for the party. Plus: Matthew Taylor on the growing prevalence of climate anxiety. Lunchtime read: \u2018Overwhelming and terrifying\u2019 The climate crisis has dominated much of the news agenda in the past year with the media saturated with images of drought, fires and flooding. But a worrying corollary to the crisis is the rise of climate anxiety, especially among younger people such as 20-year-old Clover Hogan. Matthew Taylor investigates. Sport England\u2019s coach, Eddie Jones, was pleased with the way his players adapted to treacherous conditions in the Six Nations to beat Scotland and the weather. Tournament organisers have launched an investigation into an incident before the game at Murrayfield when a member of England\u2019s coaching staff was struck on the head by a beer bottle. Eoin Morgan said the key to victory was the performance of England\u2019s veteran spin-bowling duo, Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali, after a nerve-jangling but ultimately comfortable two-wicket win against South Africa in Johannesburg. Jemma Reekie has continued her incredible record-breaking run by smashing the British indoor mile and indoor 1500m records at the Millrose Games in New York \u2013 just a week after she claimed the national 800m record. Dele Ali has apologised for a video posted on his Snapchat account in which the Tottenham and England midfielder appeared to mock an Asian man and joke about the coronavirus outbreak. And Pakistan\u2019s 16-year-old paceman Naseem Shah has become the youngest player to take a hat-trick in Test cricket. Business The new boss of John Lewis has hinted that she might consider store closures as middle Britain\u2019s favourite shop struggles with the changing face of the high street. Our retail expert, Zoe Wood, looks at what was once an unthinkable option. On the markets, Asian shares have dipped 0.5% outside Japan as investors assess the extent of China\u2019s coronavirus woes. The FTSE100 is set to dip 0.25% at the opening while the pound is buying $1.29 and \u20ac1.178.

The 20-year-old, who now lives in London, grew up in Queensland, Australia, cheekbyjowl with the country\u2019s wildlife, fishing frogs out of the toilet and dodging snakes hanging from the ceiling.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bushfires\">bushfires ravaging her homeland</a> over the past few weeks have taken their toll. \u201cI\u2019ve found myself bursting into tears \u2026 just seeing the absolutely harrowing images of what\u2019s happening in Australia \u2013 it is overwhelming and terrifying.\u201d</p> <p>Hogan said her lowest point came when she heard about the death of half a billion animals incinerated as the fires swept through the bush. \u201cThat was the moment where I felt my heart cleave into two pieces. I felt absolutely distraught.\u201d</p> <p>The physical impact of the climate crisis is impossible to ignore, but experts are becoming increasingly concerned about another, less obvious consequence of the escalating emergency \u2013 the strain it is putting on people\u2019s mental wellbeing, especially the young.</p> <p>Psychologists warn that the impact can be debilitating for the growing number of people overwhelmed by the scientific reality of ecological breakdown and for those who have lived through traumatic climate events, often on the climate frontline in the global south..</p> <p>Until two years ago Dr <a href=\"https://www.psychologyoxford.com/climate-project-dr-patrick-kennedy-williams-eco-anxiety\">Patrick Kennedy-Williams</a>, a clinical psychologist from Oxford, had spent his career treating common mental health difficulties including anxiety, depression and trauma. Then something new started to happen. Climate scientists and researchers working in Oxford began to approach him asking for help.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/10/everyday-arts-low-carbon-creativity-climate-crisis\">Why we need to value our low-carbon pastimes more | Susanna Rustin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThese were people who were essentially facing a barrage of negative information and downward trends in their work \u2026 and the more they engaged with the issue, the more they realised what needed to be done \u2013 and the more they felt that was bigger than their capacity to enact meaningful change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe consequences of this can be pretty dire \u2013 anxiety, burnout and a sort of professional paralysis.\u201d</p> <p>Kennedy-Williams began to research the topic and realised it was not just scientists and researchers who were suffering. \u201cThere is a huge need among parents, for instance, who are asking for support on how to talk to their kids about this.\u201d</p> <p>When Kennedy-Williams began focusing on young people he assumed most would be older teenagers or at least have started secondary school. But he soon discovered worrying levels of environment-related stress and anxiety in much younger children.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I was most surprised by is how young the awareness and anxiety starts. My own daughter was just six when she came to me and said: \u2018Daddy, are we winning the war against climate change?\u2019 and I was just flummoxed by that question in the moment. It really showed me the importance as a parent of being prepared for the conversation, so we can respond in a helpful way.\u201d</p> <p>He says there is no way to completely shield young people from the reality of the climate crisis, and argues that would be counterproductive even if it were possible. Rather, parents should talk to their children about their concerns and help them feel empowered to take action \u2013 however small \u2013 that can make a difference.</p> <p>A key moment for Kennedy-Williams came with the realisation that tackling \u201cclimate anxiety\u201d and tackling the climate crisis were intrinsically linked.</p> <p>\u201cThe positive thing from our perspective as psychologists is that we soon realised the cure to climate anxiety is the same as the cure for climate change \u2013 action. It is about getting out and doing something that helps.</p> <p>\u201cRecord and celebrate the changes you make. Nobody is too small. Make connections with other people and at the same time realise that you are not going to cure this problem on your own. This isn\u2019t all on you and it\u2019s not sustainable to be working on solving climate change 24/7.\u201d</p> <p>This certainly resonates with Hogan, who has set up <a href=\"https://www.forceofnature.xyz/\">Force of Nature</a>, an initiative aimed at helping young people realise their potential to create change.</p> <p>Hogan\u2019s group aims to target people aged 11-24 with a crash course in the climate crisis that helps them navigate their anxiety and realise their potential to get involved, take action and make a stand.</p> <p>\u201cThis is only the beginning,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see massive, massive widespread climate crisis in every country around the world, so it\u2019s about developing the emotional resilience to carry on, but in a way that ignites really dramatic individual initiative.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond climate anxiety \u2013 the fear that the current system is pushing the Earth beyond its ecological limits \u2013 experts are also warning of a sharp rise in trauma caused by the experience of climate-related disasters.</p> <p>In the global south, increasingly intense storms, wildfires, droughts and heatwaves have left their mark not just physically but also on the mental wellbeing of millions of people.</p> <p>For Elizabeth Wathuti, a climate activist from Kenya, her experience of climate anxiety is not so much about the future but what is happening now. \u201cPeople in African countries experience eco-anxiety differently because climate change for us is about the impacts that we are already experiencing now and the possibilities of the situation getting worse,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16e5e8fa9382e7022cf9ff402f10cc53f9d10c4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16e5e8fa9382e7022cf9ff402f10cc53f9d10c4e/0_200_5795_3477/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Wathuti, a climate activist from Kenya, says a common worry she hears among students is, \u2018We won\u2019t die of old age, we\u2019ll die from climate change\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Wathuti, a climate activist from Kenya, says a common worry she hears among students is, \u2018We won\u2019t die of old age, we\u2019ll die from climate change\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aitor Baez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She works with young people through the <a href=\"https://www.queenscommonwealthtrust.org/inspiration/green-generation-initiative-ggi-kenya-environment-conservation/\">Green Generation Initiative</a> she founded and sees the effects of eco-anxiety first-hand. A common worry she hears among students is: \u201cWe won\u2019t die of old age, we\u2019ll die from climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Extreme climate events can create poverty, which exacerbates mental health problems, and Wathuti says she has seen stress, depression and alcohol and drug abuse as some of the side-effects of climate anxiety and trauma in her country. </p> <p>Even in the UK, a recent <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prepare-for-flooding-to-reduce-impacts-on-mental-health\">study by the Environment Agency</a> found that people who experience extreme weather such as storms or flooding are 50% more likely to suffer from mental health problems, including stress and depression, for years afterwards.</p> <p>More than 1,000 clinical psychologists <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU6L3NM12ikT-34ZPlp1yv-6nHcM5aqhmid6nK-M3plZGu3A/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1\">have signed an open letter</a> highlighting the impact of the crisis on people\u2019s wellbeing and predicting \u201cacute trauma on a global scale in response to extreme weather events, forced migration and conflict\u201d.</p> <p>Kaaren Knight, a clinical psychologist who coordinated the letter, said: \u201cThe physical impacts related to extreme weather, food shortages and conflict are intertwined with the additional burden of mental health impacts and it is these psychologists are particularly concerned about.\u201d </p> <p>She added that fear and trauma \u201csignificantly reduced psychological wellbeing\u201d, particularly in children. \u201cThis is of huge concern to us and needs to be part of the conversation when we talk about climate breakdown.\u201d</p> <p>One of the high-profile signatories of the letter, Prof Mike Wang, the chair of the Association of Clinical Psychologists UK, said: \u201cInaction and complacency are the privileges of yesterday \u2026 Psychologists are ready and willing to help countries protect the health and wellbeing of their citizens given the inevitable social and psychological consequences of climate change.\u201d</p> <p>This rallying of the psychological profession around the climate crisis has led to experts around the world forming groups to research and treat the growing number of people caught up in the unfolding crisis, attempting to help them move from fear and paralysis towards action.</p> <p>But even for those who are following this advice, the scale of the emergency is taking its toll. Kennedy Williams \u2013 who has set up his own group, <a href=\"https://www.climatepsychologists.com/\">Climate Psychologists</a>, specialising in climate anxiety \u2013 said he and his colleagues were not immune from the psychological impacts of the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThis is such a universal thing that [we] have all been through our own set of climate-related grief and despair, and we talk about riding the wave between hope and despair \u2026 it is absolutely as real for us as it is for anyone else.\u201d</p> <h2>Advice for parents</h2> <p><strong>Remember that you do not need to be a climate expert </strong>It\u2019s OK to explore learning together. If your child asks a question you can\u2019t answer immediately, respond by saying: \u201cWhat a great question. Let me look into that so I can answer it properly.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Try</strong><strong> to validate, rather than minimise, children\u2019s emotions </strong>If children express anxiety, it\u2019s much better to say: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to feel worried. Here is what we can do about it,\u201d than to say: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s all fine.\u201d But always try to support this emotion with suggestions for positive action.</p> <p><strong>Negative information hits harder </strong>Bad or threatening facts tend to resonate more strongly \u2013 and therefore stick in the mind. So try to balance one piece of negative news with three pieces of positive news. Have some examples of good climate-related news ready \u2013 for example, successful conservation projects.</p> <p><strong>For younger children, keep it local and tangible </strong>Suggest litter picks and school events. For teenagers, encourage them to stay connected at a wider level \u2013 help them write to their MP, take part in protests and join local communities and campaigns.</p> <p><strong>Set practical goals as a family and follow through </strong>Record and celebrate your climate successes together (even a piece of paper on the fridge door). Reinforce the message that small actions can make a big difference.</p>",

I felt absolutely distraught.\u201d The physical impact of the climate crisis is impossible to ignore, but experts are becoming increasingly concerned about another, less obvious consequence of the escalating emergency \u2013 the strain it is putting on people\u2019s mental wellbeing, especially the young. Psychologists warn that the impact can be debilitating for the growing number of people overwhelmed by the scientific reality of ecological breakdown and for those who have lived through traumatic climate events, often on the climate frontline in the global south.. Until two years ago Dr Patrick Kennedy-Williams, a clinical psychologist from Oxford, had spent his career treating common mental health difficulties including anxiety, depression and trauma. Then something new started to happen. Climate scientists and researchers working in Oxford began to approach him asking for help. \u201cThese were people who were essentially facing a barrage of negative information and downward trends in their work \u2026 and the more they engaged with the issue, the more they realised what needed to be done \u2013 and the more they felt that was bigger than their capacity to enact meaningful change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe consequences of this can be pretty dire \u2013 anxiety, burnout and a sort of professional paralysis.\u201d Kennedy-Williams began to research the topic and realised it was not just scientists and researchers who were suffering. \u201cThere is a huge need among parents, for instance, who are asking for support on how to talk to their kids about this.\u201d When Kennedy-Williams began focusing on young people he assumed most would be older teenagers or at least have started secondary school. But he soon discovered worrying levels of environment-related stress and anxiety in much younger children. \u201cWhat I was most surprised by is how young the awareness and anxiety starts. My own daughter was just six when she came to me and said: \u2018Daddy, are we winning the war against climate change?\u2019 and I was just flummoxed by that question in the moment. It really showed me the importance as a parent of being prepared for the conversation, so we can respond in a helpful way.\u201d He says there is no way to completely shield young people from the reality of the climate crisis, and argues that would be counterproductive even if it were possible. Rather, parents should talk to their children about their concerns and help them feel empowered to take action \u2013 however small \u2013 that can make a difference. A key moment for Kennedy-Williams came with the realisation that tackling \u201cclimate anxiety\u201d and tackling the climate crisis were intrinsically linked. \u201cThe positive thing from our perspective as psychologists is that we soon realised the cure to climate anxiety is the same as the cure for climate change \u2013 action. It is about getting out and doing something that helps. \u201cRecord and celebrate the changes you make. Nobody is too small. Make connections with other people and at the same time realise that you are not going to cure this problem on your own. This isn\u2019t all on you and it\u2019s not sustainable to be working on solving climate change 24/7.\u201d This certainly resonates with Hogan, who has set up Force of Nature, an initiative aimed at helping young people realise their potential to create change. Hogan\u2019s group aims to target people aged 11-24 with a crash course in the climate crisis that helps them navigate their anxiety and realise their potential to get involved, take action and make a stand. \u201cThis is only the beginning,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see massive, massive widespread climate crisis in every country around the world, so it\u2019s about developing the emotional resilience to carry on, but in a way that ignites really dramatic individual initiative.\u201d Beyond climate anxiety \u2013 the fear that the current system is pushing the Earth beyond its ecological limits \u2013 experts are also warning of a sharp rise in trauma caused by the experience of climate-related disasters. In the global south, increasingly intense storms, wildfires, droughts and heatwaves have left their mark not just physically but also on the mental wellbeing of millions of people. For Elizabeth Wathuti, a climate activist from Kenya, her experience of climate anxiety is not so much about the future but what is happening now. \u201cPeople in African countries experience eco-anxiety differently because climate change for us is about the impacts that we are already experiencing now and the possibilities of the situation getting worse,\u201d she said. She works with young people through the Green Generation Initiative she founded and sees the effects of eco-anxiety first-hand. A common worry she hears among students is: \u201cWe won\u2019t die of old age, we\u2019ll die from climate change.\u201d Extreme climate events can create poverty, which exacerbates mental health problems, and Wathuti says she has seen stress, depression and alcohol and drug abuse as some of the side-effects of climate anxiety and trauma in her country. Even in the UK, a recent study by the Environment Agency found that people who experience extreme weather such as storms or flooding are 50% more likely to suffer from mental health problems, including stress and depression, for years afterwards. More than 1,000 clinical psychologists have signed an open letter highlighting the impact of the crisis on people\u2019s wellbeing and predicting \u201cacute trauma on a global scale in response to extreme weather events, forced migration and conflict\u201d. Kaaren Knight, a clinical psychologist who coordinated the letter, said: \u201cThe physical impacts related to extreme weather, food shortages and conflict are intertwined with the additional burden of mental health impacts and it is these psychologists are particularly concerned about.\u201d She added that fear and trauma \u201csignificantly reduced psychological wellbeing\u201d, particularly in children. \u201cThis is of huge concern to us and needs to be part of the conversation when we talk about climate breakdown.\u201d One of the high-profile signatories of the letter, Prof Mike Wang, the chair of the Association of Clinical Psychologists UK, said: \u201cInaction and complacency are the privileges of yesterday \u2026 Psychologists are ready and willing to help countries protect the health and wellbeing of their citizens given the inevitable social and psychological consequences of climate change.\u201d This rallying of the psychological profession around the climate crisis has led to experts around the world forming groups to research and treat the growing number of people caught up in the unfolding crisis, attempting to help them move from fear and paralysis towards action. But even for those who are following this advice, the scale of the emergency is taking its toll. Kennedy Williams \u2013 who has set up his own group, Climate Psychologists, specialising in climate anxiety \u2013 said he and his colleagues were not immune from the psychological impacts of the crisis. \u201cThis is such a universal thing that [we] have all been through our own set of climate-related grief and despair, and we talk about riding the wave between hope and despair \u2026 it is absolutely as real for us as it is for anyone else.\u201d Advice for parents Remember that you do not need to be a climate expert It\u2019s OK to explore learning together. If your child asks a question you can\u2019t answer immediately, respond by saying: \u201cWhat a great question. Let me look into that so I can answer it properly.\u201d Try to validate, rather than minimise, children\u2019s emotions If children express anxiety, it\u2019s much better to say: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to feel worried. Here is what we can do about it,\u201d than to say: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s all fine.\u201d But always try to support this emotion with suggestions for positive action. Negative information hits harder Bad or threatening facts tend to resonate more strongly \u2013 and therefore stick in the mind. So try to balance one piece of negative news with three pieces of positive news. Have some examples of good climate-related news ready \u2013 for example, successful conservation projects. For younger children, keep it local and tangible Suggest litter picks and school events. For teenagers, encourage them to stay connected at a wider level \u2013 help them write to their MP, take part in protests and join local communities and campaigns. Set practical goals as a family and follow through Record and celebrate your climate successes together (even a piece of paper on the fridge door). Reinforce the message that small actions can make a big difference.",

      "bodyText": "Radio New Zealand Concert, the staid classical music arm of Radio New Zealand, does not usually create headlines. But the hackles of classical music lovers across the nation have been raised after the public broadcaster announced it was cutting much of the station to make way for programmes targeted at a younger audience. The ensuing furore has sparked disputes on social media about whether classical music is elitist or only for the elderly and prompted the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, to wade in. The station draws about 170,000 listeners a week in New Zealand, heavily skewed towards those aged 65 and older, according to the broadcaster. But fans mobilised last week when Radio New Zealand proposed to throw out its classical arm\u2019s FM station in May, replacing it with a youth radio channel in August. Some 18 jobs would be eliminated, with new roles created at the youth station, RNZ said. An automated classical music programme, without presenters, would be streamed 24/7 online. Some scathingly referred to the planned format as a classical music \u201cjukebox\u201d sector. \u201cThis equates to a dumbing down of cultural life in NZ,\u201d a former New Zealand prime minister, Helen Clark, wrote on Twitter. Others said Clark\u2019s argument was elitist. \u201cThe idea that there\u2019s smart arts and dumb arts is flat out wrong,\u201d said one Twitter user. By Monday, more than 23,000 people had signed a petition urging Radio New Zealand to reconsider the move and a 10,000-strong Facebook group called \u201cSave RNZ Concert\u201d, was discussing how to protest, with options including marches and legal action. Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, the New Zealand opera singer, said the station was \u201ciconic, very important\u201d and likened its gutting to cutting the All Blacks rugby team. As opposition to the move grew \u2013 in perhaps the most controversy the station had ever caused \u2013 Ardern added her doubts to the pile, saying she was \u201cfrustrated\u201d that RNZ had announced the demise of the classical station without asking the government for help first. She announced on Monday that her cabinet would consider its own plan to free up FM frequency for the proposed youth station so that Concert could remain at its current frequency. Ardern did not explain whether her government would offer separate funding for the continued operating costs and salaries at the classical station. Radio New Zealand is funded entirely by the taxpayer; it does not receive a licence fee or subscriptions and does not broadcast advertisements. Its funding has been the source of public angst and pre-election promises, and has at times fluctuated depending on which party is in power. When new funding was frozen by New Zealand\u2019s previous centre-right government \u2013 which believed the broadcaster tended to the left \u2013 more than 30,000 people signed a petition asking for more money to be unlocked. Many on social media decried Radio New Zealand\u2019s decision to use the FM frequency freed up by the demise of Concert on a youth station, pointing out that young people were more likely to stream music, rather than listen to the radio, and were already catered for by existing options. \u201cI understand that RNZ has obligations to all New Zealanders, and it is their view that they are not catering for one sector,\u201d Ardern said in the RNZ interview. \u201cBut it is my view as arts minister that one does not need to come at the cost of another.\u201d A Radio New Zealand spokesman declined to comment on Ardern\u2019s remarks until the organisation\u2019s board had met to consider her counter-proposal. Research commissioned by the broadcaster, and seen by the Guardian, expressed concerns that Radio New Zealand was not relevant \u201cto people in all their life stages\u201d and was failing to connect with non-white audiences \u2013 particular M\u0101ori, Pacific Island and Asian groups, all growing demographics in New Zealand \u2013 and young people. As a public service broadcaster, RNZ has an obligation to serve all New Zealand audiences and does not appeal to a diverse enough population to do that, the research said.",

The supermarket\u2019s deal with the online grocer will finish at the end of August, when it will be replaced by Marks &amp; Spencer. The switchover is high risk for all the brands involved: Ocado risks losing loyal Waitrose shoppers while the supermarket, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership, will have to persuade shoppers to use its own website instead. Last year, Ocado fired the opening salvo stating its product range would be bigger, cheaper and better quality under the M&amp;S deal. The online grocer will stock 6,000 M&amp;S products, compared with the 4,000 it sells as part of its supply deal with Waitrose. The alternatives would be the \u201csame price or lower, and of the same quality or better\u201d than the Waitrose ones, Ocado said. Waitrose on the other hand says it is working on 5,000 new or reformulated products \u2013 a figure that equates to nearly a third of the 17,000 own-label products sold under house brands such as Duchy, Essential Waitrose and No.1. To come up with more distinctive products the retailer has made a multimillion-pound investment in the kitchens at its Bracknell headquarters in Berkshire. The supermarket is also running a \u201cyou can taste when it\u2019s Waitrose\u201d advertising campaign to underline its foodie credentials. With short ads focused on \u201chand-rolled white sourdough bread made in London\u201d and \u201c100% Italian\u201d olive oil produced in Umbria, the marketing push aims to claim the high ground as the UK\u2019s \u201cleading quality food retailer\u201d selling products \u201cunrivalled on quality and taste\u201d. The charm offensive comes ahead of Ocado\u2019s full-year results on Tuesday when an update on the M&amp;S joint venture is anticipated. After nearly a decade as an unloved listed company, Ocado has become a stock market darling after its chief executive, Tim Steiner, sold its grocery-picking expertise to several foreign supermarkets. Ocado\u2019s shares have risen 40% over the past 12 months with the company worth more than \u00a38bn, primarily thanks to the overseas deals banked by its tech arm Ocado Solutions (M&amp;S paid \u00a3750m for 50% of Ocado Retail, the subsidiary that operates robotic warehouses in the UK). The year was not without its setbacks: its hi-tech warehouse in Andover, Hampshire, was destroyed in a fire. Analysts at Bernstein expect pre-tax losses to have widened to \u00a3204m on sales of \u00a31.8bn in 2019. Waitrose had enlisted Today Development Partners, a technology business run by Ocado co-founder Jonathan Faiman, to help grow its online operation without Ocado. However, the deal ended after just four months and it subsequently emerged Faiman, who left the online business in 2009, was being sued by Ocado. Thomas Davies, a retail analyst at Berenberg bank, expects some Waitrose shoppers to defect but suggests they will be replaced by M&amp;S customers who can\u2019t buy its food online at the moment. Ocado owns the customer data so \u201cwill be able to target those customers that it views to be most at risk from switching\u201d, he suggested. \u201cWhile everyone is looking at the potential impact from Ocado\u2019s perspective, we believe investors are failing to acknowledge the negative impact on Waitrose, from ending the Ocado contract,\u201d continued Davies who said the tie-up generated 6% of Waitrose\u2019s sales. \u201cThis will have a material impact on Waitrose\u2019s owner, the John Lewis Partnership, which is already struggling with margins that have fallen.\u201d",

Each will be 30 this year, making them the youngest to be commissioned in the event\u2019s 20-year history. Counterspace said their idea was for the pavilion to be based on and inspired by places where people gather across London, particularly migrant and other peripheral communities.

The pavilion, as well as being a popular free-to-visit tourist attraction, plays host each year to lively programmes of events, performances, debates and discussions. This year they will be linked to a wide-ranging Serpentine project titled Back to Earth, which invites artist responses to the climate emergency.

Many have lived in the UK since childhood. Last week more than 100 cross-party MPs and peers signed a Labour-led letter to Boris Johnson calling for the flight to be postponed pending recommendations from a review into Windrush. The letter, put together by the new Labour MP Nadia Whittome and Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cNot only is there an unacceptable risk of removing anyone with a potential Windrush claim, but there has been a failure by the government to remedy the causes of the Windrush scandal.\u201d The letter asked a series of questions about those due to be deported, including regarding their access to legal advice and to mobile phones, and how many had been in the UK since they were children. The Home Office has not responded to recommendations from the former prisons ombudsman Stephen Shaw or to a leak from the Windrush Lessons Learned review which suggested that foreign national offenders who have lived in the UK for most of their lives should not face automatic deportation. Last year the Guardian revealed that at least five men had been murdered following their deportation to Jamaica. One of the five was Dewayne Robinson, 37. It has emerged that Robinson was the cousin of Akeem Finlay, 30, one of those who is facing enforced return to Jamaica on Tuesday following a GBH conviction.

      "body": "<p>I was originally due to meet Christopher Eccleston a few months back. The plan was to discuss his new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/i-love-the-bones-of-you-9781471176319.html\" title=\"\">I Love the Bones of You</a>, which is part autobiography and part moving tribute to his father, Ronnie, who died in 2012 following a long period with dementia. But then word reached us that the actor was keen not to dwell on that; was there anything else we might like him to talk about?</p> <p>It is unusual for a celebrity to want to discuss anything <em>other</em> than the thing they were promoting. But it turns out Eccleston had his reasons for changing the subject. His book focuses heavily on his previously undisclosed struggle with anorexia and a mental breakdown so intense that the Priory psychiatrist Justin Haslam described it as one of the worst cases of clinical depression he had ever seen. Eccleston, 55, found it easy enough to write his account of the trauma, but the subsequent task of promoting it was far tougher than he had expected.</p> <p>\u201cIt became very difficult,\u201d he says, when we meet up in London at a members\u2019 club in Soho. \u201cGoing on Lorraine, for instance, where you\u2019ve got a couple of minutes to try and be articulate about anorexia. I think of myself as really quite robust \u2013 but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ywivy701I\" title=\"\">I felt very exposed</a>.\u201d</p> <p>He casts his mind back and smiles: \u201cI mean, can you imagine going on The One Show to talk about clinical depression? They went straight from me to a piece about badgers!\u201d</p> <p>Eccleston\u2019s breakdown came in early 2016 after his relationship with his wife, Mishka, collapsed; the pair are now divorced and co-parenting. He says he\u2019s a lot better, even if recovery is likely to always be a work in progress. He exudes what you might call classic northern warmth \u2013 a big handshake to greet me, an arm around the shoulder even, and a keenness to make sure everyone in the room is happy, from the photographer to the woman bringing us coffees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73a086bb9db4f0e3904cab41a382d1b0cb0c48e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73a086bb9db4f0e3904cab41a382d1b0cb0c48e8/0_0_1920_1151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Eccleston with Daniel Craig in Our Friends in the North\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Eccleston with Daniel Craig in Our Friends in the North.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writing a book was a big thing for Eccleston. It covers his acting career, of course \u2013 those defining roles in Shallow Grave, Our Friends in the North and Doctor Who, as well as his 1991 breakthrough as Derek Bentley in Let Him Have It \u2013 but it is largely focused on the demons that have pursued him through life. It is delivered with searing honesty, and that is how he comes across today \u2013 a great talker, open about everything \u2013 which is strange, given that opening up doesn\u2019t come naturally to him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m male and northern and from a working-class background, so you were not supposed to speak about your feelings,\u201d he says. \u201cI still carry all the baggage about masculinity and toughness, and I was ashamed about my depression and eating disorder.\u201d</p> <p>So why write it?</p> <p>\u201cBecause I do think that the breakdown and hospitalisation changed my life,\u201d he says, and as he does so his voice wobbles, almost breaking for a second. Eccleston has a big presence but there is an obvious fragility there. \u201cIt changed my view of myself and existence. I really felt that I was going to die.\u201d</p> <p>At his worst moment, Eccleston contemplated suicide. \u201cI did have what people might call intrusive thoughts.\u201d But then he thought about his two children, Albert and Esme, and the legacy it might leave. \u201cI think cowardice played a part too,\u201d he says, allowing himself a smile. \u201cI thought: \u2018That\u2019s gotta hurt.\u2019 Sorry to be crass.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Eccleston ended up in a psychiatric ward, celebrating his 52nd birthday on his second day inside. He remembers that day, seeing himself in the mirror and realising he was walking like he had seen mentally ill people walk onscreen \u2013 he gets up and shuffles across the room to demonstrate, all hunched up. \u201cI remember clocking it and thinking: \u2018Am I acting this?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His doctors told him that there was a severe imbalance in his brain chemistry and he was put on high doses of medication. The trigger might have been the split from his wife, and the guilt around not seeing his children, but Eccleston\u2019s problems had been brewing for years. Since childhood, he had suffered from body image problems. He wanted to be androgynous \u2013 \u201cStill do, because I feel like a prop forward\u201d \u2013 but he knew his mum and dad wouldn\u2019t have tolerated their kid dabbling in eye liner on the streets of working-class Salford, where he grew up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"292d891c8b38dc88dfaa6fe97769e1ee6e8a6600\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/292d891c8b38dc88dfaa6fe97769e1ee6e8a6600/0_186_2373_1423/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Eccleston with Kerry Fox and Ewan McGregor in Shallow Grave\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eccleston with Kerry Fox and Ewan McGregor in Shallow Grave (1994).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI could do all the male stuff \u2013 I was captain of the sports team and I\u2019d get very physical on the field,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I also had this interest in femininity. When I did my first play at Eccles college, Lock Up Your Daughters, I wore mascara and I was like: \u2018This is fucking brilliant!\u2019 I was expressing on the outside what I felt on the inside.\u201d</p> <p>He was never confused about his sexuality, although he says he has always appreciated male beauty. His relationship with his male friends had always been especially intimate, too: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible word, but there were <em>suspicions</em>,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause of how we were together.\u201d</p> <p>What Eccleston was actually hiding from his family were his issues with food. These only became worse when he ventured into acting, so determined was he to achieve the striking angular features of his heroes such as Daniel Day-Lewis.</p> <p>Anorexia is, he says, \u201clike being in hell\u201d. Did it affect him every day?</p> <p>\u201cEvery minute. All you think about is food \u2013 the consumption of, the rejection of. You don\u2019t think about anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Eccleston\u2019s approach to his work has always been intense and obsessive \u2013 not just in how he approaches his characters but in how he picks his roles. Yes, he has indulged in some Hollywood fluff in his career \u2013 he has described himself as a \u201cwhore\u201d for starring in GI Joe and Thor \u2013 but he normally evaluates his roles in terms of what social good they\u2019re bringing to the screen.</p> <p>\u201cLike my dad, who was an autodidact, I always saw television as political,\u201d he says. \u201cI always felt the work had to have some value beyond just me showing off, which I love doing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1891410f1c503f9d97184fd12befa32f733c7d98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1891410f1c503f9d97184fd12befa32f733c7d98/0_106_3296_1978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eccleston in Let Him Have It\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eccleston as Derek Bentley in his 1991 breakthrough, Let Him Have It (with Paul Reynolds).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He once turned down the role of Begbie in Trainspotting, thinking it a cliche to cast a northern man in the most violent role (he wrote to Danny Boyle to say he thought he should be Renton instead). His proudest achievements aren\u2019t always his most famous: Jimmy McGovern dramas such as Hearts and Minds or Hillsborough; Peter Bowker\u2019s 2002 TV film Flesh and Blood. But even deciding to become Doctor Who or Macbeth had a political element to it \u2013 showing kids that a working-class lad from Salford could do it.</p> <p>His choices, he thinks, were a subconscious attempt to make his father proud. His dad has been the overriding influence in his life, and this is something the book unravels with admirable elegance. I\u2019ll admit that for the first 50 pages or so I worried it was going to be overly sentimental \u2013 Ronnie starts off being portrayed as an almost saintly character. But then Eccleston talks about his dad\u2019s rages \u2013 terrorising the whole household when he returned home from work \u2013 and he writes incisively about the frustrations bound up in this man whose background meant he was never given the opportunity to reach his full potential. Eccleston bases most of his roles on aspects of his father and he unpicks every aspect of his character, good and bad, that came from him, too. His life story \u2013 from the highs of acting and the lows of depression \u2013 ends up far rounder for having been intertwined with that of his father\u2019s.</p> <p>Despite the devotion to his dad, Eccleston\u2019s mother, Elsie \u2013 with who he had, if not a better, then a far less complex, relationship \u2013 emerges as the real rock of the family, the unsung heroine. Has she read the book?</p> <p>\u201cShe has,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve still not had the absolute conversation about it. I think she\u2019s a bit ambiguous about it.

His first UK job from there was to continue his role as Maurice in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09flzps\" title=\"\">The A Word</a>, Bowker\u2019s BBC drama that centres around a young boy with autism. It is a show that means an awful lot to him: he has become close friends with Leon Harrop, the actor with Down\u2019s syndrome who plays Ralph, and he loves the fact that television is bringing autism \u2013 \u201csomething that affects millions of people\u2019s lives in some way or other\u201d \u2013 into people\u2019s homes. But the series is also closely connected with his recovery. \u201cI first became ill on The A Word,\u201d he says. \u201cThey saw it and they cared for me.\u201d</p> <p>In his book he relates how his agent convinced him to finish filming series one of the show before checking into hospital, which sounds like terribly irresponsible advice to me given his condition.</p> <p>\u201cWell, she did tell me that she found it hard seeing that written down,\u201d he admits. \u201cShe\u2019s a very sensitive, very intelligent human being. But I think, as a fellow who has defined himself by work, what she was saying to me was: \u2018There <em>will </em>be a future \u2013 but less of one if you don\u2019t finish The A Word, because it will leave you in the shit.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It is a depressing truth that leaving the show would likely have led to insurance issues for production companies hoping to cast him again. That may be the case anyway, given that he has now publicly disclosed his mental health issues. \u201cWhat my agent and I discussed was that the more I worked, the more relaxed the insurers would become, and I\u2019ve not missed a day\u2019s work since,\u201d he says, proudly. Still, he has noticed that work has been thin on the ground recently. \u201cI only had three months\u2019 work last year and there\u2019s nothing coming up now,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s possibly got more to do with me being white, male and middle-aged. And, quite rightly, those stories, which I\u2019ve benefited from for 30 years, are not being told at the moment. I completely accept that. But I\u2019m hoping that there are a few toxic male roles I can play soon. Surely we\u2019ve not cleaned them all out!\u201d</p> <p>Reading Eccleston\u2019s book, I was struck by how relentlessly critical he was of his own achievements. Whether it was playing Macbeth (\u201ca deeply flawed performance\u201d) or starring as Nicky Hutchinson in Our Friends in the North (Daniel Craig and Mark Strong supposedly gave better performances), he is never particularly kind to himself. Had I never seen him act I would assume, from his own words, that he was poor to middling at best.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a98b50e03c922edf5a9a67289347133c80f690fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a98b50e03c922edf5a9a67289347133c80f690fd/0_45_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Eccleston at Blacks Club, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eccleston in London in 2020: \u2018I still don\u2019t watch my performances, but I am easier on myself.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s how I feel most of the time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s tied up with my whole notion of being thick and working-class.

      "bodyText": "I was originally due to meet Christopher Eccleston a few months back. The plan was to discuss his new book, I Love the Bones of You, which is part autobiography and part moving tribute to his father, Ronnie, who died in 2012 following a long period with dementia. But then word reached us that the actor was keen not to dwell on that; was there anything else we might like him to talk about? It is unusual for a celebrity to want to discuss anything other than the thing they were promoting. But it turns out Eccleston had his reasons for changing the subject. His book focuses heavily on his previously undisclosed struggle with anorexia and a mental breakdown so intense that the Priory psychiatrist Justin Haslam described it as one of the worst cases of clinical depression he had ever seen. Eccleston, 55, found it easy enough to write his account of the trauma, but the subsequent task of promoting it was far tougher than he had expected. \u201cIt became very difficult,\u201d he says, when we meet up in London at a members\u2019 club in Soho. \u201cGoing on Lorraine, for instance, where you\u2019ve got a couple of minutes to try and be articulate about anorexia. I think of myself as really quite robust \u2013 but I felt very exposed.\u201d He casts his mind back and smiles: \u201cI mean, can you imagine going on The One Show to talk about clinical depression? They went straight from me to a piece about badgers!\u201d Eccleston\u2019s breakdown came in early 2016 after his relationship with his wife, Mishka, collapsed; the pair are now divorced and co-parenting. He says he\u2019s a lot better, even if recovery is likely to always be a work in progress. He exudes what you might call classic northern warmth \u2013 a big handshake to greet me, an arm around the shoulder even, and a keenness to make sure everyone in the room is happy, from the photographer to the woman bringing us coffees. Writing a book was a big thing for Eccleston. It covers his acting career, of course \u2013 those defining roles in Shallow Grave, Our Friends in the North and Doctor Who, as well as his 1991 breakthrough as Derek Bentley in Let Him Have It \u2013 but it is largely focused on the demons that have pursued him through life. It is delivered with searing honesty, and that is how he comes across today \u2013 a great talker, open about everything \u2013 which is strange, given that opening up doesn\u2019t come naturally to him. \u201cI\u2019m male and northern and from a working-class background, so you were not supposed to speak about your feelings,\u201d he says. \u201cI still carry all the baggage about masculinity and toughness, and I was ashamed about my depression and eating disorder.\u201d So why write it? \u201cBecause I do think that the breakdown and hospitalisation changed my life,\u201d he says, and as he does so his voice wobbles, almost breaking for a second. Eccleston has a big presence but there is an obvious fragility there. \u201cIt changed my view of myself and existence. I really felt that I was going to die.\u201d At his worst moment, Eccleston contemplated suicide. \u201cI did have what people might call intrusive thoughts.\u201d But then he thought about his two children, Albert and Esme, and the legacy it might leave. \u201cI think cowardice played a part too,\u201d he says, allowing himself a smile. \u201cI thought: \u2018That\u2019s gotta hurt.\u2019 Sorry to be crass.\u201d Instead, Eccleston ended up in a psychiatric ward, celebrating his 52nd birthday on his second day inside. He remembers that day, seeing himself in the mirror and realising he was walking like he had seen mentally ill people walk onscreen \u2013 he gets up and shuffles across the room to demonstrate, all hunched up. \u201cI remember clocking it and thinking: \u2018Am I acting this?\u2019\u201d His doctors told him that there was a severe imbalance in his brain chemistry and he was put on high doses of medication. The trigger might have been the split from his wife, and the guilt around not seeing his children, but Eccleston\u2019s problems had been brewing for years. Since childhood, he had suffered from body image problems. He wanted to be androgynous \u2013 \u201cStill do, because I feel like a prop forward\u201d \u2013 but he knew his mum and dad wouldn\u2019t have tolerated their kid dabbling in eye liner on the streets of working-class Salford, where he grew up. \u201cI could do all the male stuff \u2013 I was captain of the sports team and I\u2019d get very physical on the field,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I also had this interest in femininity. When I did my first play at Eccles college, Lock Up Your Daughters, I wore mascara and I was like: \u2018This is fucking brilliant!\u2019 I was expressing on the outside what I felt on the inside.\u201d He was never confused about his sexuality, although he says he has always appreciated male beauty. His relationship with his male friends had always been especially intimate, too: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible word, but there were suspicions,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause of how we were together.\u201d What Eccleston was actually hiding from his family were his issues with food. These only became worse when he ventured into acting, so determined was he to achieve the striking angular features of his heroes such as Daniel Day-Lewis. Anorexia is, he says, \u201clike being in hell\u201d. Did it affect him every day? \u201cEvery minute. All you think about is food \u2013 the consumption of, the rejection of. You don\u2019t think about anything else.\u201d Eccleston\u2019s approach to his work has always been intense and obsessive \u2013 not just in how he approaches his characters but in how he picks his roles. Yes, he has indulged in some Hollywood fluff in his career \u2013 he has described himself as a \u201cwhore\u201d for starring in GI Joe and Thor \u2013 but he normally evaluates his roles in terms of what social good they\u2019re bringing to the screen. \u201cLike my dad, who was an autodidact, I always saw television as political,\u201d he says. \u201cI always felt the work had to have some value beyond just me showing off, which I love doing.\u201d He once turned down the role of Begbie in Trainspotting, thinking it a cliche to cast a northern man in the most violent role (he wrote to Danny Boyle to say he thought he should be Renton instead). His proudest achievements aren\u2019t always his most famous: Jimmy McGovern dramas such as Hearts and Minds or Hillsborough; Peter Bowker\u2019s 2002 TV film Flesh and Blood. But even deciding to become Doctor Who or Macbeth had a political element to it \u2013 showing kids that a working-class lad from Salford could do it. His choices, he thinks, were a subconscious attempt to make his father proud. His dad has been the overriding influence in his life, and this is something the book unravels with admirable elegance. I\u2019ll admit that for the first 50 pages or so I worried it was going to be overly sentimental \u2013 Ronnie starts off being portrayed as an almost saintly character. But then Eccleston talks about his dad\u2019s rages \u2013 terrorising the whole household when he returned home from work \u2013 and he writes incisively about the frustrations bound up in this man whose background meant he was never given the opportunity to reach his full potential. Eccleston bases most of his roles on aspects of his father and he unpicks every aspect of his character, good and bad, that came from him, too. His life story \u2013 from the highs of acting and the lows of depression \u2013 ends up far rounder for having been intertwined with that of his father\u2019s. Despite the devotion to his dad, Eccleston\u2019s mother, Elsie \u2013 with who he had, if not a better, then a far less complex, relationship \u2013 emerges as the real rock of the family, the unsung heroine. Has she read the book? \u201cShe has,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve still not had the absolute conversation about it. I think she\u2019s a bit ambiguous about it. I was worried she\u2019d think I\u2019d betrayed her.\u201d At Christmas last year, Eccleston thought things had come to a head when his mother told him he\u2019d \u201cgot it wrong\u201d in his book. She apparently said: \u201cWhen you first moved to London, I didn\u2019t send you a fiver every other week. It was a tenner.\u201d He grins: \u201cI was just relieved it wasn\u2019t something deeper.\u201d Eccleston actually moved back in with Elsie after getting out of the psychiatric ward, continuing his recovery while she looked after him in his childhood home. His first UK job from there was to continue his role as Maurice in The A Word, Bowker\u2019s BBC drama that centres around a young boy with autism. It is a show that means an awful lot to him: he has become close friends with Leon Harrop, the actor with Down\u2019s syndrome who plays Ralph, and he loves the fact that television is bringing autism \u2013 \u201csomething that affects millions of people\u2019s lives in some way or other\u201d \u2013 into people\u2019s homes. But the series is also closely connected with his recovery. \u201cI first became ill on The A Word,\u201d he says. \u201cThey saw it and they cared for me.\u201d In his book he relates how his agent convinced him to finish filming series one of the show before checking into hospital, which sounds like terribly irresponsible advice to me given his condition. \u201cWell, she did tell me that she found it hard seeing that written down,\u201d he admits. \u201cShe\u2019s a very sensitive, very intelligent human being.

      "body": "<p>Can we fully absorb the scale of the climate crisis without becoming paralysed by fear? This is a big question, with more than one answer. But it helps, I think, to recognise the extent of the challenge to our imaginations. The Indian writers Arundhati Roy and Amitav Ghosh have expressed this best. Roy used the image of a mountain filled with valuable bauxite to ask whether we could ever care enough about our environment to leave resources in the ground. Last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/31/arundhati-roy-novelist-god-small-things-activism\" title=\"\">she spelled out </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/31/arundhati-roy-novelist-god-small-things-activism\" title=\"\">her belief </a>that the answer goes beyond politics, since what is needed is an \u201cimagination that neither the left or the right has. To decide how you\u2019re going to manage without\u201d the wealth derived from mineral resources.</p> <p>Ghosh\u2019s book The Great Derangement argues that humanity\u2019s alienation from nature is a delusion more than two centuries in the making \u2013 and one that writers and artists have proved as unable to resist as everyone else. \u201cLet us make no mistake,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe climate crisis is also a crisis of culture, and thus of the imagination.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s an idea that is easy to mock, I know. All the more so when leading UK cultural institutions have refused to cut ties with fossil fuel giants</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But if our imagination has failed us, what should we do about it? Richard Powers\u2019 novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/08/the-overstory-richard-powers-review\" title=\"\">The Overstory</a> asks, among other things, to what extent evolution is to blame. His character Adam Appich, a maverick young scholar, falls upon a book called The Ape Inside Us as a revelation. Appich becomes a psychologist, studying tree activists in the hope of determining whether, in \u201cappealing to a new, nonhuman moral order\u201d, they are remaking human nature.</p> <p>Thinking about why it has taken so long to push climate up the list of human priorities is important.

      "bodyText": "Can we fully absorb the scale of the climate crisis without becoming paralysed by fear? This is a big question, with more than one answer. But it helps, I think, to recognise the extent of the challenge to our imaginations. The Indian writers Arundhati Roy and Amitav Ghosh have expressed this best. Roy used the image of a mountain filled with valuable bauxite to ask whether we could ever care enough about our environment to leave resources in the ground. Last year she spelled out her belief that the answer goes beyond politics, since what is needed is an \u201cimagination that neither the left or the right has. To decide how you\u2019re going to manage without\u201d the wealth derived from mineral resources. Ghosh\u2019s book The Great Derangement argues that humanity\u2019s alienation from nature is a delusion more than two centuries in the making \u2013 and one that writers and artists have proved as unable to resist as everyone else. \u201cLet us make no mistake,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe climate crisis is also a crisis of culture, and thus of the imagination.\u201d But if our imagination has failed us, what should we do about it? Richard Powers\u2019 novel The Overstory asks, among other things, to what extent evolution is to blame. His character Adam Appich, a maverick young scholar, falls upon a book called The Ape Inside Us as a revelation. Appich becomes a psychologist, studying tree activists in the hope of determining whether, in \u201cappealing to a new, nonhuman moral order\u201d, they are remaking human nature. Thinking about why it has taken so long to push climate up the list of human priorities is important. That it barely featured in recent Brazilian and Indian election campaigns is one of many frightening facts about the current situation. Even more alarming is the prospect that the intensifying struggle over the planet\u2019s diminishing resources could fuel the rise of ethno-nationalism. Policies such as the green new deal \u2013 advocated by the UK Labour party and on the left of the US Democratic party \u2013 are brave attempts to grapple with the scale of the crisis, while Finland\u2019s pledge to become climate neutral by 2035 places it firmly at the front of the developed-nations pack. Moves towards decarbonisation by global corporations and in the upper echelons of financial capital must also be welcomed \u2013 even if they are likely to be too little and too late. That none of these measures are anything like sufficient is self-evident. But if capitalists, politicians and scientists have so far not found the answers \u2013 and the global mass movement of people called for by Greta Thunberg and others is, despite recent progress, still proving elusive \u2013 could the creative arts possibly provide one means to break the impasse? If the climate emergency is seen as the consequence of a failure of imagination, then this would seem to make sense. Creativity is not the exclusive preserve of artists and writers. But if one of the difficulties that humans face \u2013 as we confront the prospect of choosing between climate chaos and drastic reductions in emissions \u2013 is working out how to live in this parallel universe of radically reduced consumption, then surely they can help. I don\u2019t mean by describing the crisis in plays or disaster movies or books, although all these are useful. Nor do I mean that artists have a duty to suggest solutions, although an upcoming exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London, Among the Trees, looks like an appealing contribution to a wider conversation about ecology. I mean that all those people and organisations that believe that human fulfilment can be found in artistic expression and creativity \u2013 in making things, singing, music-making and acting \u2013 should make the case for a reordering of society that places much greater emphasis on such opportunities, in place of our destructive habits of travel and consumption. It\u2019s an idea that is easy to mock, I know.

      "bodyText": "A Conservative minister personally lobbied the Bahraini royal family to give a multi-billion dollar oil contract to a company under investigation for suspected bribery and money laundering. The intervention from Liam Fox, who was international trade secretary at the time, was one of several attempts by senior Conservatives to help Petrofac, which is headed by a major Tory party donor, to secure the $5bn contract. The Guardian has previously revealed that two former Conservative prime ministers, Theresa May and David Cameron, lobbied the Bahrain royals to award the contract to Petrofac, before it was publicly known the company was being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). However, newly\u2013released documents reveal Fox wrote a letter to the Bahraini crown prince promoting Petrofac four months after the SFO announced an investigation into the firm for suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering. On the same day as the SFO announced it was investigating Petrofac in 2017, the firm said its chief executive, Ayman Asfari, had been arrested and interviewed by the SFO during the investigation, along with others. Asfari, who is the firm\u2019s co-founder and largest shareholder, was released without charge. The SFO\u2019s investigation into the firm, which is not believed to relate to Bahrain, is ongoing. Asfari and his wife donated almost \u00a3800,000 to the Conservative party between 2009 and 2017 in a personal capacity. A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: \u201cThe government supports British business at home and abroad, including backing companies when they bid for international opportunities. This was the case for Petrofac. The then trade secretary followed the correct processes, carried out with due propriety throughout.\u201d The spokesperson declined to say if Fox had sought advice as to how to manage any perceived conflicts of interest arising from Asfari\u2019s political donations. Fox declined to comment. Petrofac said official support was obtained through normal channels, with the backing of the British ambassador to Bahrain. The contract was later awarded to another firm. A spokesperson said: \u201cPetrofac does not make political donations. Any donations by Ayman Asfari and his family are made in a strictly personal capacity. Any suggestion that Mr Asfari\u2019s donations were the basis for preferential treatment by government for Petrofac are entirely false.\u201d In 2017, Petrofac, which designs and builds facilities for the oil and gas industry, was bidding for the contract to expand a Bahraini state-owned refinery in competition with other firms. In January that year, Cameron, who had resigned as prime minister in 2016, visited Bahrain. After the two-day visit, Cameron was flown back to Britain on a plane belonging to Asfari. He has said that he carried out a \u201cwide-ranging schedule of engagements\u201d with the British ambassador and promoted Petrofac \u201cin coordination with the UK government at the time\u201d. He has said he \u201cwas not paid anything for this engagement and his support for the company had nothing whatsoever to do with donations made to the Conservative party\u201d. In March 2017 Fox, while international trade secretary, wrote to May telling her that Asfari had asked the British government to promote Petrofac\u2019s bid for the refinery contract as Asfari believed that \u201chigh level government support could make a substantial difference\u201d. At Fox\u2019s request, May wrote to the Gulf state\u2019s prime minister, another member of the Bahraini royal family, to promote Petrofac\u2019s bid. It was sent the day after Fox met Asfari in his Whitehall office. Fox\u2019s direct contact with the Bahraini royal family in 2017 is revealed in documents that have been released to the Guardian under the freedom of information act. On May 11, Fox rang the Bahraini crown prince, Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, to discuss Petrofac\u2019s bid for the refinery contract. The following day, the SFO announced that it had launched an investigation into Petrofac over suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering. Four months later, on September 28, Fox wrote to the crown prince about Petrofac\u2019s bid for the contract. \u201cI very much appreciate the constructive engagement that has taken place between our governments as competition for the [refinery contract] has progressed,\u201d Fox began. He recalled that May had met with the King of Bahrain at Sandhurst in April and discussed how the contract could \u201cfurther the bilateral economic relationship\u201d. Fox added that he had called the crown prince in May \u201cto explain the offer of financing support from the UK as well as my confidence in the bid submitted by Petrofac and their consortium partners\u201d. Fox added: \u201cI understand that Petrofac has been identified as one of the top two bidders for this project and therefore very much hope that they will be called back for an opportunity to present their final proposal to BAPCO [Bahrain\u2019s state-owned oil company]. \u201cPetrofac have been able to improve on their original bid in a number of ways and it would be beneficial, I am sure, for the tender board to make a final evaluation of the best two bids on their merits.\u201d Fox also asked to talk further with the crown prince. Asfari, who reportedly has an estimated $1bn fortune, has headed Petrofac for two decades after co-founding it in 1991. In 2014 Cameron appointed Asfari to be one of 43 prime minister\u2019s business ambassadors, selected by the British government to promote trade and investment. The scheme was closed last year. A former Petrofac executive, David Lufkin, is waiting to be sentenced after pleading guilty last year to 11 counts of offering bribes between 2011 and 2016, in an attempt to secure contracts for the firm in Saudi Arabia and Iraq.

Chances are that Parasite is a one-off, and there is little will to disperse influence internationally. But this would only reflect where Hollywood\u2019s true constituency now lies \u2013 its overseas box-office take has steadily risen from 50% in 2000 to a record high of 73% last year. The Hollywood presence has influenced and energised film-makers everywhere, many of whom \u2013 like Bong \u2013 show truer appreciation of its old storytelling ideals and bring a little something of their own to the party. His triumph should be the first of many for the global brigade.",

The town\u2019s 30,000 residents even held local elections in 2017.</p> <p>Saraqib held out for years against the rise of Islamic factions as the uprising morphed into an intractable civil war, but eventually came under the control of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a militant group linked to al-Qaida. Last week, eight years after the regime withdrew from the town, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/08/syrian-forces-capture-new-areas-from-insurgents\">Assad\u2019s forces once again stepped foot on Saraqib\u2019s empty, bombed out streets</a>.</p> <p>The victory was not completely hollow. Saraqib, at the intersection of the M4 and M5 highways connecting Damascus to Aleppo and the country\u2019s west to the east, sits at both a literal and metaphorical crossroads \u2013 between the past and future, between Assad and his people, and between the hope for change and the darkness that instead engulfed the country.</p> <p>\u201cSaraqib means a lot to us. It represents freedom, it represents resistance, revolution and fairness. I don\u2019t know if I will be able to go back,\u201d said local activist Ahmad al-Khaled, 33, who recently fled the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/syria-pro-assad-forces-batter-idlib-spark-fears-fresh-crisis\">airstrikes on Saraqib</a> for Idlib city.</p> <p>Saraqib\u2019s residents paid a heavy price for a brief taste of freedom. Protests in 2011 were met with a bruising crackdown by the government. Hundreds of people were arrested and tortured in regime prisons and the fates of some are still unknown.</p> <p>Aided by foreign money and guns, the protesters began to arm themselves and the Free Syrian Army clashed with government troops for control of the strategically located town.</p> <p>\u201cIn the beginning we had so much hope. We watched the downfall of the presidents of Egypt and Tunisia and later [Colonel Muammar] Gaddafi and it gave us motivation. When the city was liberated in November 2012 we were free for the first time in our lives,\u201d Khaled said.</p> <p>By 2013, Saraqib noticed there was a new enemy. \u201cWe were demonstrating one day, demanding the downfall of the regime, when we met another group of men. They had a white flag with religious slogans on it,\u201d said Odai al-Hussein, 28.</p> <p>\u201cWe began chanting, \u2018Saraqib is a civil state! We want a civil state!\u2019 and one of them assaulted one of us, threatening, \u2018We will attain our caliphate by force!\u2019 and then they stamped on the Free Syrian Army flag and went away.\u201d</p> <p>The Ahrar al-Sham jihadist group slowly began to intervene in Saraqib, opening bakeries and a health clinic and distributing money to widows in an effort to supplant the local council.</p> <p>\u201cThey set up a sharia court. They were always trying to gain people\u2019s trust by providing money and services but I guess our people were smart enough to not believe them, since they didn\u2019t abide by the revolution\u2019s principles and goals,\u201d Hussein said.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted a free Syria for all Syrians but they wanted an Islamic state. We continued against all the odds: we challenged the regime, Ahrar al-Sham, Islamic State and al-Nusra. In the end the jihadists took over but we left our city with dignity knowing how much we endured to keep Saraqib free.\u201d</p> <p>After Russia came to Assad\u2019s aid in 2015 the tide of the war began to turn in the regime\u2019s favour. Helped by Russian airpower, the government began to claw back rebel territory in a series of brutal sieges and bombing campaigns.

The classic \u201cOscar dress\u201d look celebrates not just a 1950s silhouette but a 1950s vision of popcorn-scented, drive-in-cinema Americana. The Academy Awards may be dragging their heels over diversity and the underrepresentation of women, but the red carpet is starting to drag the Oscars into the 21st century. Billie Eilish has scored the cover of next month\u2019s American edition of Vogue, with four different covers on newsstands, wearing Gucci, Prada, Versace and Louis Vuitton. In all four portraits, the clothes are oversized, shapeless and chin-high. For a young pop star to seize the style limelight while making her dress size invisible and irrelevant is a radical move.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29cbeff2a87e4957944ea4bd34b0341daf0968a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29cbeff2a87e4957944ea4bd34b0341daf0968a2/0_0_3318_2467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scarlett Johansson in Oscar de la Renta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"744\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scarlett Johansson in Oscar de la Renta</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Gaillard/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Scarlett Johansson in Oscar de la Renta.</p></li> </ul> <p>There was still plenty of red carpet va-va voom on a red carpet which rustled under feathers, sequins and sparkle. But many of the night\u2019s standout dresses had a caustic kind of glamour, reflective of the new generation of action female roles which have helped make actors such as Scarlett Johansson into Hollywood power players. There was a Marvel-esque superhero edge to Johansson\u2019s \u00d3scar de la Renta dress, which had a chainmail bodice that seemed to defy the laws of gravity, and a molten silver train which she flicked like a crocodile switching its train as she turned. She posed for the banks of cameras looking over her left shoulder, the better to showcase the black rose tattooed up her spine. In caped metallic Ralph Lauren, Janelle Mon\u00e1e brought the fierce hauteur of Grace Jones to her red carpet turn. Cynthia Erivo\u2019s Versace gown had a sculpted bodice that was closer in spirit to Wonder Woman\u2019s breastplate than to a traditional prom dress. Maya Rudolph chose a kaftan-adjacent dress entirely covered in blood-orange paillettes from Valentino\u2019s new collection, and stood for her red carpet portraits with her hands casually in the pockets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"891cc585c35dfc0d02a2803fabde27af52eacf4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/891cc585c35dfc0d02a2803fabde27af52eacf4d/892_0_2693_3367/800.jpg\" alt=\"Janelle Monae in a metallic hooded Ralph Lauren dress\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Janelle Mon\u00e1e in a metallic hooded Ralph Lauren dress</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Locher/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"aed0441288a0f6750a433cadd4d8af93bffeb8b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aed0441288a0f6750a433cadd4d8af93bffeb8b1/1321_0_2423_3030/800.jpg\" alt=\"British actress Cynthia Erivo in a Versace gowqn\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British actress Cynthia Erivo in a Versace gown</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Janelle Mon\u00e1e in metallic Ralph Lauren, and Cynthia Erivo in Versace.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"18e03007ee73675583b0b575b738a17cded4c63b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18e03007ee73675583b0b575b738a17cded4c63b/1014_122_2835_2836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maya Rudolph\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maya Rudolph</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was notably little mention of sustainability.

Spike Lee was regal in Lakers purple in tribute to Kobe Bryant \u2013 a collaboration with Gucci. Ten-year-old Julia Butters, the scene-stealing young actor in Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, wore a fuchsia western-style Christian Siriano shirt-dress with a sparkling bolo tie instead of a necklace. Natalie Portman wore a cape embroidered with the names of female film directors who were not nominated for Oscars. Julia Butters, 10 yrs old in Siriano, and Spike Lee in a Lakers purple in tribute to Kobe Bryant. Old Hollywood glamour is deeply symbolic of Old Hollywood values, so this shift is not only about clothes. The classic \u201cOscar dress\u201d look celebrates not just a 1950s silhouette but a 1950s vision of popcorn-scented, drive-in-cinema Americana. The Academy Awards may be dragging their heels over diversity and the underrepresentation of women, but the red carpet is starting to drag the Oscars into the 21st century. Billie Eilish has scored the cover of next month\u2019s American edition of Vogue, with four different covers on newsstands, wearing Gucci, Prada, Versace and Louis Vuitton. In all four portraits, the clothes are oversized, shapeless and chin-high. For a young pop star to seize the style limelight while making her dress size invisible and irrelevant is a radical move. Scarlett Johansson in Oscar de la Renta. There was still plenty of red carpet va-va voom on a red carpet which rustled under feathers, sequins and sparkle. But many of the night\u2019s standout dresses had a caustic kind of glamour, reflective of the new generation of action female roles which have helped make actors such as Scarlett Johansson into Hollywood power players. There was a Marvel-esque superhero edge to Johansson\u2019s \u00d3scar de la Renta dress, which had a chainmail bodice that seemed to defy the laws of gravity, and a molten silver train which she flicked like a crocodile switching its train as she turned. She posed for the banks of cameras looking over her left shoulder, the better to showcase the black rose tattooed up her spine. In caped metallic Ralph Lauren, Janelle Mon\u00e1e brought the fierce hauteur of Grace Jones to her red carpet turn. Cynthia Erivo\u2019s Versace gown had a sculpted bodice that was closer in spirit to Wonder Woman\u2019s breastplate than to a traditional prom dress. Maya Rudolph chose a kaftan-adjacent dress entirely covered in blood-orange paillettes from Valentino\u2019s new collection, and stood for her red carpet portraits with her hands casually in the pockets. Janelle Mon\u00e1e in metallic Ralph Lauren, and Cynthia Erivo in Versace. There was notably little mention of sustainability. One of the few exceptions was Booksmart actor Kaitlyn Dever, who took a stance in support of the Red Carpet Green Dress initiative, led by Suzy Amis Cameron. Dever wore a ruby red strapless dress custom made in line with \u201cethical and eco-responsible\u201d principles by Louis Vuitton, according to the fashion house. Kaitlyn Dever in ethical and eco-responsible Louis Vuitton. Among the men, black-on-black tuxedos were a trend. Parasite director Bong Joon-ho chose a black bow tie with a simple matching shirt, Al Pacino went with a shawl-collared tux and a fringed silk scarf.",

      "bodyText": "South Korean film-maker Bong Joon-ho has become the second director of a foreign-language film to win the best director Oscar at the 92nd Academy Awards. Bong follows Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (who won for Roma in 2018) as a foreign-language winner with Parasite, seeing off competition from the likes of Quentin Tarantino (for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), Todd Phillips for Joker and the pre-ceremony favourite Sam Mendes (for 1917). Bong paid tribute to Scorsese in his speech, saying that when he was young he \u201ccarved deep into my heart\u201d a quote by Scorsese: \u201cThe most personal is the most creative.\u201d He also thanked Tarantino for championing his work: \u201cQuentin, I love you.\u201d Parasite, which won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes film festival in May, is a satirical thriller about a hard-up family who manage to infiltrate the lives of a much richer one. It follows two successful (mostly) English-language films directed by Bong: the train-set sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer and the giant-pig eco fable Okja. Since Cannes, Parasite has won a string of awards, including best foreign language film at the Baftas and Golden Globes, with Bong winning a number of critics awards for the film\u2019s direction.",

      "body": "<p>This year\u2019s big Agatha Christie adaptation, The Pale Horse, is one of her less well-known murder mysteries \u2013 but in some ways it has had a much greater impact than the others. The novel is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_Horse#References_or_allusions\">credited with saving two lives and has also been cited in a murder trial</a>.</p> <p>The novel centres around a series of apparently unrelated deaths that have all been attributed to a wide variety of natural causes. Mark Easterbrook becomes suspicious when a young woman dies just weeks after he saw her in a cafe, apparently in the prime of life, and he decides to investigate. Christie\u2019s tale of contract killers, witches and black magic is a fantastic example of her brilliant plotting and superb ability to keep you guessing whodunnit right until the very end.</p> <p>The novel, as would be expected of Christie, is packed with poisonous information and killer clues. It is sufficiently detailed that on two occasions readers recognised symptoms in people who were being poisoned and were able to intervene. It seems reading Christie could save your life. But the same novel has also been accused of inspiring a murderer.</p> <p>Christie often used real life cases of murder as sources for her plots but on this occasion it was allegedly the other way round. There are certainly some uncomfortable parallels between The Pale Horse and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2702828-the-st-albans-poisoner\">the crimes committed by Graham Young</a>. The novel was published in 1961, the year before Young began his poisoning activities, but at his trial in 1971 he denied having read it. It is doubtful that Christie, scientifically accurate though she was, could have taught him anything anyway, as Young had made his own extensive and detailed studies of all things toxic.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to give away too much about The Pale Horse and spoil your enjoyment of the drama but I do want to discuss just how brilliantly Christie used her scientific knowledge to construct the plot. So to avoid giving away whodunnit but to offer you lots of clues, this article is all about Young, one of Britain\u2019s most prolific poisoners, and some of the uncomfortably similar circumstances of his real-life murderous career and Christie\u2019s fiction.</p> <p>Young\u2019s fascination with the macabre and toxicology started when he was a schoolboy. He excelled at chemistry but nothing else, despite being a bright student. His extensive knowledge convinced a local pharmacist Young was much older than he appeared and enabled the schoolboy to get hold of some unusual and dangerous compounds. The pharmacist thought he was being encouraging and supportive, but Young was using the pharmacist for his own devious ends: poisoning his family.</p> <p>Young began adding different compounds to different foods in the family home. He stirred <a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/mtm/atropine-injection.html\">atropine</a> into his sister\u2019s tea and added <a href=\"https://www.symptoma.com/en/info/antimony-poisoning\">antimony</a> to the jars of jam in the cupboards and watched the results.</p> <p>The atropine experiment was not a success from Young\u2019s point of view. It made the tea taste bitter, so his sister only drank a mouthful before leaving for work. During her bus journey she started to feel dizzy. She got to her office but by then she was having trouble focusing her eyes. Her condition was serious enough that she was taken to hospital, where the doctors recognised the symptoms and were able to treat her successfully.</p> <p>The antimony in the jam also had an effect on the family: lots of vomiting and painful cramps in the legs. Most of the poison would have been removed by the vomit but the small amount that remained slowly built up in the body with repeated doses. Disappointed with the slow progress the poison was making on his stepmother, Young added a large dose of <a href=\"https://calpoison.org/news/thallium-poisoning\">thallium</a> to her tea one day. He was found by the kitchen window watching her writhe in agony in the back garden. She died the same day but her death was attributed to natural causes.</p> <p>Young continued to dose his father with antimony, often sneaked into his pint of beer when he wasn\u2019t looking. Eventually his father was taken to hospital, where he recovered, but he remained suspicious of his son.</p> <p>Encouraged by his initial successes Young also poisoned a school friend, Chris Williams. Williams\u2019s deteriorating health sounded alarm bells at the school and a psychiatrist was brought in to question Young under the pretext of being a careers advisor. Young\u2019s evident fascination with toxicology, and nothing but toxicology, was the key to discovering the truth of his poisoning habits and he was sent to Broadmoor psychiatric hospital.</p> <p>More poisonings occurred during his time in Broadmoor. He added toilet cleaner to the nurses\u2019 tea and sugar soap to the sugar bowl but fortunately no one touched either. Another patient killed himself using <a href=\"https://www.emedicinehealth.com/cyanide_poisoning/article_em.htm\">cyanide</a> \u2013 a fast acting but horrible poison that can cause blinding headaches, disorientation and convulsions before collapse, coma and death in rapid succession. Young had talked about how to extract cyanide from laurel leaves, which grew abundantly in the grounds of Broadmoor. He was not accused of killing the patient but the laurel bushes were cut down nevertheless. After these early incidents Young turned himself into a model patient and after nine years was deemed safe to be allowed to return to society.</p> <p>Shortly after his release he got a job in the storeroom of Hadland\u2019s, a company that made photographic equipment. He volunteered to take on the tea round, a job no one else wanted. Everyone had their own mug and as Young pushed the tea trolley around the premises there was one point where he was completely unobserved. It was the perfect opportunity for him to selectively poison his co-workers. Some were given antimony, others thallium. Young varied the dose depending on whether someone had annoyed him that day and noted down his observations in a diary.</p> <p>Young managed to poison eight people, two of whom died before he was caught. The eight people were examined by a total of 43 physicians during their illnesses and not one of them diagnosed poisoning of any kind. The seemingly random symptoms could not be attributed to a single cause. Graham\u2019s victims suffered agonising pains, hallucinations, one went blind, others had their hair fall out. The illnesses were attributed to conditions as varied as broncho-pneumonia and a mystery virus.</p> <p>The truth was only discovered because Young could not resist showing off his toxicology knowledge. At a meeting at the factory to discuss the \u201cbug\u201d that seemed to be afflicting so many of its employees, he spoke at length about heavy metal poisoning and their symptoms. A search of his room revealed an extensive collection of poisons, toxicology books and the diary where he had noted the symptoms of his co-workers. In the dock Young claimed the diary was notes he was preparing for a novel. No one was convinced, and he was sentenced to life for murder.</p> <p>Young evaded suspicion for so long because he used poisons whose symptoms mimicked other illnesses and were so varied that no single cause was immediately obvious. It is the same problem that faces Easterbrook in The Pale Horse, and just as in the real-life case of Young, it is only a chance discovery and some bragging that reveals the truth.

      "bodyText": "This year\u2019s big Agatha Christie adaptation, The Pale Horse, is one of her less well-known murder mysteries \u2013 but in some ways it has had a much greater impact than the others. The novel is credited with saving two lives and has also been cited in a murder trial. The novel centres around a series of apparently unrelated deaths that have all been attributed to a wide variety of natural causes. Mark Easterbrook becomes suspicious when a young woman dies just weeks after he saw her in a cafe, apparently in the prime of life, and he decides to investigate. Christie\u2019s tale of contract killers, witches and black magic is a fantastic example of her brilliant plotting and superb ability to keep you guessing whodunnit right until the very end. The novel, as would be expected of Christie, is packed with poisonous information and killer clues. It is sufficiently detailed that on two occasions readers recognised symptoms in people who were being poisoned and were able to intervene. It seems reading Christie could save your life. But the same novel has also been accused of inspiring a murderer. Christie often used real life cases of murder as sources for her plots but on this occasion it was allegedly the other way round. There are certainly some uncomfortable parallels between The Pale Horse and the crimes committed by Graham Young. The novel was published in 1961, the year before Young began his poisoning activities, but at his trial in 1971 he denied having read it. It is doubtful that Christie, scientifically accurate though she was, could have taught him anything anyway, as Young had made his own extensive and detailed studies of all things toxic. I don\u2019t want to give away too much about The Pale Horse and spoil your enjoyment of the drama but I do want to discuss just how brilliantly Christie used her scientific knowledge to construct the plot. So to avoid giving away whodunnit but to offer you lots of clues, this article is all about Young, one of Britain\u2019s most prolific poisoners, and some of the uncomfortably similar circumstances of his real-life murderous career and Christie\u2019s fiction. Young\u2019s fascination with the macabre and toxicology started when he was a schoolboy. He excelled at chemistry but nothing else, despite being a bright student. His extensive knowledge convinced a local pharmacist Young was much older than he appeared and enabled the schoolboy to get hold of some unusual and dangerous compounds. The pharmacist thought he was being encouraging and supportive, but Young was using the pharmacist for his own devious ends: poisoning his family. Young began adding different compounds to different foods in the family home. He stirred atropine into his sister\u2019s tea and added antimony to the jars of jam in the cupboards and watched the results. The atropine experiment was not a success from Young\u2019s point of view. It made the tea taste bitter, so his sister only drank a mouthful before leaving for work. During her bus journey she started to feel dizzy. She got to her office but by then she was having trouble focusing her eyes. Her condition was serious enough that she was taken to hospital, where the doctors recognised the symptoms and were able to treat her successfully. The antimony in the jam also had an effect on the family: lots of vomiting and painful cramps in the legs. Most of the poison would have been removed by the vomit but the small amount that remained slowly built up in the body with repeated doses. Disappointed with the slow progress the poison was making on his stepmother, Young added a large dose of thallium to her tea one day. He was found by the kitchen window watching her writhe in agony in the back garden. She died the same day but her death was attributed to natural causes. Young continued to dose his father with antimony, often sneaked into his pint of beer when he wasn\u2019t looking. Eventually his father was taken to hospital, where he recovered, but he remained suspicious of his son. Encouraged by his initial successes Young also poisoned a school friend, Chris Williams. Williams\u2019s deteriorating health sounded alarm bells at the school and a psychiatrist was brought in to question Young under the pretext of being a careers advisor. Young\u2019s evident fascination with toxicology, and nothing but toxicology, was the key to discovering the truth of his poisoning habits and he was sent to Broadmoor psychiatric hospital. More poisonings occurred during his time in Broadmoor. He added toilet cleaner to the nurses\u2019 tea and sugar soap to the sugar bowl but fortunately no one touched either. Another patient killed himself using cyanide \u2013 a fast acting but horrible poison that can cause blinding headaches, disorientation and convulsions before collapse, coma and death in rapid succession. Young had talked about how to extract cyanide from laurel leaves, which grew abundantly in the grounds of Broadmoor. He was not accused of killing the patient but the laurel bushes were cut down nevertheless. After these early incidents Young turned himself into a model patient and after nine years was deemed safe to be allowed to return to society. Shortly after his release he got a job in the storeroom of Hadland\u2019s, a company that made photographic equipment. He volunteered to take on the tea round, a job no one else wanted. Everyone had their own mug and as Young pushed the tea trolley around the premises there was one point where he was completely unobserved. It was the perfect opportunity for him to selectively poison his co-workers. Some were given antimony, others thallium. Young varied the dose depending on whether someone had annoyed him that day and noted down his observations in a diary. Young managed to poison eight people, two of whom died before he was caught. The eight people were examined by a total of 43 physicians during their illnesses and not one of them diagnosed poisoning of any kind. The seemingly random symptoms could not be attributed to a single cause. Graham\u2019s victims suffered agonising pains, hallucinations, one went blind, others had their hair fall out. The illnesses were attributed to conditions as varied as broncho-pneumonia and a mystery virus. The truth was only discovered because Young could not resist showing off his toxicology knowledge. At a meeting at the factory to discuss the \u201cbug\u201d that seemed to be afflicting so many of its employees, he spoke at length about heavy metal poisoning and their symptoms. A search of his room revealed an extensive collection of poisons, toxicology books and the diary where he had noted the symptoms of his co-workers. In the dock Young claimed the diary was notes he was preparing for a novel. No one was convinced, and he was sentenced to life for murder. Young evaded suspicion for so long because he used poisons whose symptoms mimicked other illnesses and were so varied that no single cause was immediately obvious. It is the same problem that faces Easterbrook in The Pale Horse, and just as in the real-life case of Young, it is only a chance discovery and some bragging that reveals the truth. Will you spot the links between the real and fictional cases? And, armed in advance with so many clues, will you be able to work out whodunnit before Easterbrook? The Pale Horse, written by Sarah Phelps, will air on BBC One in the coming months; a screening date has not yet been confirmed.",

Wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan \u201cToo fast to live / Too young to die\u201d, frontman Matty Healy was sleepy-eyed and perpetually pouting, but his lyrics are designed to grab his fans by the shoulders and shake hard. Lyrics and messages blasted across the screen for an hour warning of the lure of self-medicating with drugs and technology, and everyone in the crowd rushed to raise their phones to capture them for posterity, feeding the endless cycle.</p> <p>The band\u2019s backing dancers, the Jaiy twins, joined them intermittently, but otherwise it was all about Healy. He does this frontman thing in a way only Brits can: he\u2019s as bombastic and performative as he is self-deprecating, and you could tell he enjoyed every moment of the way <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSnAllHtG70\">the visuals for finale track The Sound</a> ripped into him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec0a0b80d1e23a59ade9bbaceb020479e953477e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec0a0b80d1e23a59ade9bbaceb020479e953477e/0_0_4570_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Healy on stage at the festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Healy: doing the frontman thing in a way only Brits can.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Philbey/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At a time when celebrities are desperately trying to attach themselves to relevant causes to earn airtime, Healy holds the attention of millions in his palm and uses it to broadcast what matters. When he told the crowd to \u201cbe quiet for a few minutes\u201d, they dutifully complied \u2013 for the most part. The stage went dark as visuals of global climate disaster blare across the screens, alongside captions for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWcfzAfuFyE&amp;feature=emb_title\">Greta Thunberg\u2019s recent collaboration with the band</a>. \u201cAh, fuckin\u2019 Greta,\u201d a kid near me complained when he heard her voice. When no-one laughs or moans in agreement, he changed course: \u201cGreta\u2019s actually good for the world.\u201d Someone a foot away responds: \u201cYeah, ScoMo\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/30/the-broken-promise-of-the-sydney-opera-house-its-botched-design-and-150m-fix\">The broken promise of the Sydney Opera House, its botched design and $150m fix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around. We can still fix this,\u201d Thunberg\u2019s voice implores, and it was chilling to watch the words emblazoned on a screen underneath a moon tinted brown with dust and smoke, as so many in Australia have been this summer.</p> <p>Her words faded out and Healy was back on stage, fist raised, for Love it if We Made It, a song about drug addiction and capitalism and racism. But ultimately it\u2019s a song Healy once described as a \u201cgem of hope amongst the rubble\u201d. The sky\u2019s still smoky and the water levels are rising elsewhere in the country, and so we need to have hope in the fact that thousands of cooked teenagers stood still and listened to a plea for action for a few minutes. At least it\u2019s something to cling to.</p>",

When he told the crowd to \u201cbe quiet for a few minutes\u201d, they dutifully complied \u2013 for the most part. The stage went dark as visuals of global climate disaster blare across the screens, alongside captions for Greta Thunberg\u2019s recent collaboration with the band. \u201cAh, fuckin\u2019 Greta,\u201d a kid near me complained when he heard her voice. When no-one laughs or moans in agreement, he changed course: \u201cGreta\u2019s actually good for the world.\u201d Someone a foot away responds: \u201cYeah, ScoMo\u2019s not.\u201d \u201cYes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around. We can still fix this,\u201d Thunberg\u2019s voice implores, and it was chilling to watch the words emblazoned on a screen underneath a moon tinted brown with dust and smoke, as so many in Australia have been this summer. Her words faded out and Healy was back on stage, fist raised, for Love it if We Made It, a song about drug addiction and capitalism and racism. But ultimately it\u2019s a song Healy once described as a \u201cgem of hope amongst the rubble\u201d. The sky\u2019s still smoky and the water levels are rising elsewhere in the country, and so we need to have hope in the fact that thousands of cooked teenagers stood still and listened to a plea for action for a few minutes. At least it\u2019s something to cling to.",

More than 363,681 megalitres flowed into Warragamba Dam alone on Sunday as the dam rose from 43.8% to 61.8% of capacity. Across all of Sydney\u2019s catchments, 512,452 megalitres poured in.

      "body": "<p>At time of publication, the coronavirus had infected close to 40,000 people, the vast majority of them in China, killed more than 800 and spread to almost 30 countries. Given China\u2019s huge importance to the global economy, the ripple effect could be choppy and lasting.</p> <h2>Why is China so important to the global economy?</h2> <p>China\u2019s extraordinary economic surge over the past 40 years has resulted in it becoming the world\u2019s second biggest economy, with a GDP of $13.6tn (\u00a310.4tn) (compared with $20.5tn for the US). Annualised growth of 7% and more \u2013 way beyond the capacity of developed economies \u2013 has become the norm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2020-02-07T10:33:18/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2020-02-07T10:33:18/embed.html\">chart</a> </figure>  <p>China reached this position by supplanting the US as the fulcrum of global trade. Beijing is the largest trader of merchandise in the world, and is fast catching the US in commercial services following an 18% growth spurt in 2018. The long-held practice of sourcing components and widgets from Chinese companies, and the country\u2019s vast and growing domestic market, has encouraged thousands of foreign businesses to open their own factories on the mainland, join local distribution networks and open shops.</p> <p>China is also central to a diverse range of global supply chains: much of the world\u2019s raw materials travel to China before being turned into a manufactured product. Last year\u2019s battle with the US over import tariffs on billions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods illustrated the power of the Chinese economy to disrupt and disturb the global outlook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d864b08a2ad647fc169930aaca1a0a54012d0059\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d864b08a2ad647fc169930aaca1a0a54012d0059/0_0_5073_3043/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese residents line up to get a free protective mask at a local pharmacy in Beijing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinese residents line up to get a free protective mask at a local pharmacy in Beijing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>So how is the virus affecting economic activity within China?</h2> <p>Most industries in China shut down over the two weeks around the lunar new year. The majority of factories were not expected to open again until this weekend and some have delayed opening until 14 February as a precaution, as tens of millions of people remained locked down in dozens of cities across the country. </p> <p>Carmakers are shutting plants, coffee outlets are closed and ports are far quieter than usual. Small and medium-sized businesses, which operate on short-term contracts and with only small financial and physical reserves, are known to already be in trouble. Reports from regions across China\u2019s central belt tell of livestock farmers only days away from running out of feed.</p> <p>Wuhan, a city of about 11 million people and centre of the outbreak, is a large industrial centre, a regional hub, an important cog in the automotive industry and a magnet for foreign firms. It is the third largest education and scientific base in China, with two top-10 universities. It is impossible to think that weeks of standstill will not have a considerable impact on economic output. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, acknowledged as much last week. In response, the authorities are redoubling efforts to shore up the economy, slashing tariffs on US imports, and making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b65de0e661bea8fe8ee9b57d0696aca6f40f51d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b65de0e661bea8fe8ee9b57d0696aca6f40f51d3/0_143_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"worker in the Everwin precision technology factory in Dongguan, Guangdong Province\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker in the Everwin precision technology factory in Dongguan, Guangdong province, which produces casings for phones, tablets and laptops for Apple, Samsung and Huawei, among others.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aleksandar Plavevski/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>So what might the overall impact on China be?</h2> <p>China\u2019s economy grew by 6% last year according to Beijing\u2019s official statistics agency, which was the lowest rate for almost 30 years and a big drop from the 10.2% achieved in 2010. There were hopes that 2020 would prove to be a period of recovery following a protracted trade war during 2019 with the US Trump administration.</p> <p>The coronavirus makes that unlikely. Most analysts are still predicting growth well above 5% for the Chinese economy, based on what is known so far about the virus\u2019s spread, and the likely impact on consumers, businesses and government.</p> <p>But Zhang Ming, an official in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, is gloomier. He told Caijing magazine: \u201cGDP growth in the first quarter of 2020 could be about 5%, and we cannot rule out the possibility of falling below 5%.\u201d</p> <p>Gloomier still is the Enodo Economics chief economist, Diana Choyleva, who believes China\u2019s real growth rate figure for 2019 was probably nearer 3.7% and this year will be lower than that. Some particularly gloomy analysts are warning the worse case scenario could be economic contraction.</p> <p>Importantly, investors hoping for a decisive rebound once the outbreak is contained are likely to be disappointed. Choyleva points to the huge overhang of bad debts that plague China\u2019s ageing state-run industries, as a drag on growth over several years. China\u2019s central bank has begun to pump extra funds into the economy to maintain borrowing while the virus takes hold, mainly to boost business investment, but Choyleva said these funds, while they are cheap and plentiful, are mainly used to keep zombie companies from going bust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa5a5791268e63f9f963eb9f14be8f82dba73ed9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa5a5791268e63f9f963eb9f14be8f82dba73ed9/0_117_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cargo ship loaded with containers makes its way into a port in Qingdao in China\u2019s eastern Shandong province.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cargo ship loaded with containers makes its way into a port in Qingdao in China\u2019s eastern Shandong province.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Which industries are most vulnerable?</h2> <p>The first sectors to reel from the outbreak were the travel and tourism industries, which usually enjoy a boom during the new year holiday period. Cancelled flights and hotel bookings in China and across the Asia region, which relies on Chinese tourists, have followed the clampdown on travel to and from the big cities of China\u2019s central belt and even from the mainland to Hong Kong. Airlines have scaled back services: Cathay Pacific plans to cut flight numbers by one-third over coming weeks and has encouraged staff to take weeks of unpaid leave.</p> <p>Neil Shearing, the chief economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cPassenger numbers have fallen by 55% compared with the lunar new year period in 2019. And given that <a href=\"https://www.capitaleconomics.com/clients/publications/emerging-markets-economics/emerging-markets-economics-update/how-important-is-chinese-tourism/\">Chinese tourists spend a lot in Asian countries</a>, the costs of travel bans will be felt throughout the region.</p> <p>If the crisis persists, the global effect will be palpable. The Chinese <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IFM_Economist/status/1225554515098787846\">made 173m visits in the 12 months to end of September last year</a> and together they spent <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/06/chinese-tourists-spent-250-billion-in-2017/\">more than a quarter of a trillion dollars</a> \u2013 more than any other country.</p> <p>But tourism is just the start. Entire supply chains \u2013 automotive, electronic, industrial \u2013 are starting to creak. Shipping companies are reporting a sharp drop in container volumes. China also has a huge domestic market for retail and food and beverages. One indicator that really hit the skids last week, partly as a result of the virus, was the price of coffee. Starbucks alone has 4,000 outlets in China. Half of them were closed by the outbreak.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18602938762c6134f8d0fd24c1a24665c86edd02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18602938762c6134f8d0fd24c1a24665c86edd02/0_264_5732_3440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women wearing face masks walk past a bank\u2019s electronic board showing the Hong Kong share index.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women wearing face masks walk past a bank\u2019s electronic board showing the Hong Kong share index.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What about the stock market and other key indicators?</h2> <p>Asian stock markets endured a seesaw week last week, tumbling early because of a slump in retail, consumer services and transport businesses, before recovering amid hopes that the virus outbreak could be contained. Western markets largely followed suit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2020-02-07T18:45:00/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Nikkei 225 chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2020-02-07T18:45:00/embed.html\">Nikkei 225 chart</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2020-02-07T18:45:18/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Shanghai chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2020-02-07T18:45:18/embed.html\">Shanghai chart</a> </figure>  <p>But oil prices came under pressure too, amid anticipation of a slowdown in global demand, as did other raw materials.

There are estimates that put the damage from Sars at anything between $30bn and $50bn \u2013 big numbers, but a drop in the ocean compared with global GDP which even then was worth about $35tn.</p> <p>The coronavirus is spreading at a rate six times faster than Sars, mostly through human contact between people not yet showing symptoms. China is a much more open economy than it was even in 2002, and so the disruption is expected to be greater than that caused by Sars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ab541826dd8ebc48073b7744ddacba6a0959ccc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ab541826dd8ebc48073b7744ddacba6a0959ccc/0_0_2423_1615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cruise ship Diamond Princess, which was put into quarantine off Japan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cruise ship Diamond Princess, which was put into quarantine off the coast of Japan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hiroko Harima/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Which worldwide companies would be worst affected by a China slump?</h2> <p>Many global companies rely on suppliers based in China. For example, 290 of Apple\u2019s 800 suppliers are based in China and the country is responsible for 9% of global TV production. According to DHL\u2019s Resilience 360 index, 50% of all manufacturing in Wuhan is related to the automotive industry and 25% to technology supplies from the region.</p> <p>Automotive executives in Europe and the US are warning they are just weeks away from shortages. Hyundai has already shut down operations in South Korea because of a lack of parts from China.</p> <p>To indicate how integrated some foreign firms have become in China, the US industrial glass and ceramics maker Corning has built 19 factories across the mainland and has more than 5,000 Chinese employees. The company is planning to increase its footprint after spending $1bn on a facility to produce its state-of-the-art generation 10.5 black glass used for LCD panels.</p> <p>Apple is supplied from factories in China and has a network of 42 Apple stores that it says will remain closed until 9 February. Other US retailers from Starbucks (4,200 shops) to Levi\u2019s have closed their stores, though Levi\u2019s only closed half its complement and China only accounts for 3% of its global sales.</p> <h2>\u2026 and which countries?</h2> <p>South-east Asia is most exposed, so tightly are local economies tied to the Chinese behemoth. (It\u2019s worth remembering that Asia\u2019s worst postwar financial crisis in 1997-98 was partly blamed on the devaluation of the Chinese currency).</p> <p>Japan may be a richer economy, but it too is exposed. China is a big buyer of Japan\u2019s industrial machines, its cars and trucks and technologically advanced consumer goods. Chinese-made parts go in the other direction, feeding components into Japanese factories.</p> <p>And then there are the millions of Chinese tourists who visit their eastern neighbour each year. Already Japan is bracing for <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/04/business/400000-chinese-travelers-cancel-trips-japan/#.Xjlt-hP7TOQ\">cancellations from 400,000 people in the first quarter of 2020</a>.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s economy is tightly interconnected with China too, and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, warned last week of \u201ca real weight on the economy\u201d.

      "bodyText": "At time of publication, the coronavirus had infected close to 40,000 people, the vast majority of them in China, killed more than 800 and spread to almost 30 countries. Given China\u2019s huge importance to the global economy, the ripple effect could be choppy and lasting. Why is China so important to the global economy? China\u2019s extraordinary economic surge over the past 40 years has resulted in it becoming the world\u2019s second biggest economy, with a GDP of $13.6tn (\u00a310.4tn) (compared with $20.5tn for the US). Annualised growth of 7% and more \u2013 way beyond the capacity of developed economies \u2013 has become the norm. China reached this position by supplanting the US as the fulcrum of global trade. Beijing is the largest trader of merchandise in the world, and is fast catching the US in commercial services following an 18% growth spurt in 2018. The long-held practice of sourcing components and widgets from Chinese companies, and the country\u2019s vast and growing domestic market, has encouraged thousands of foreign businesses to open their own factories on the mainland, join local distribution networks and open shops. China is also central to a diverse range of global supply chains: much of the world\u2019s raw materials travel to China before being turned into a manufactured product. Last year\u2019s battle with the US over import tariffs on billions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods illustrated the power of the Chinese economy to disrupt and disturb the global outlook. So how is the virus affecting economic activity within China? Most industries in China shut down over the two weeks around the lunar new year. The majority of factories were not expected to open again until this weekend and some have delayed opening until 14 February as a precaution, as tens of millions of people remained locked down in dozens of cities across the country. Carmakers are shutting plants, coffee outlets are closed and ports are far quieter than usual. Small and medium-sized businesses, which operate on short-term contracts and with only small financial and physical reserves, are known to already be in trouble. Reports from regions across China\u2019s central belt tell of livestock farmers only days away from running out of feed. Wuhan, a city of about 11 million people and centre of the outbreak, is a large industrial centre, a regional hub, an important cog in the automotive industry and a magnet for foreign firms. It is the third largest education and scientific base in China, with two top-10 universities. It is impossible to think that weeks of standstill will not have a considerable impact on economic output. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, acknowledged as much last week. In response, the authorities are redoubling efforts to shore up the economy, slashing tariffs on US imports, and making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. So what might the overall impact on China be? China\u2019s economy grew by 6% last year according to Beijing\u2019s official statistics agency, which was the lowest rate for almost 30 years and a big drop from the 10.2% achieved in 2010. There were hopes that 2020 would prove to be a period of recovery following a protracted trade war during 2019 with the US Trump administration. The coronavirus makes that unlikely. Most analysts are still predicting growth well above 5% for the Chinese economy, based on what is known so far about the virus\u2019s spread, and the likely impact on consumers, businesses and government. But Zhang Ming, an official in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, is gloomier. He told Caijing magazine: \u201cGDP growth in the first quarter of 2020 could be about 5%, and we cannot rule out the possibility of falling below 5%.\u201d Gloomier still is the Enodo Economics chief economist, Diana Choyleva, who believes China\u2019s real growth rate figure for 2019 was probably nearer 3.7% and this year will be lower than that. Some particularly gloomy analysts are warning the worse case scenario could be economic contraction. Importantly, investors hoping for a decisive rebound once the outbreak is contained are likely to be disappointed. Choyleva points to the huge overhang of bad debts that plague China\u2019s ageing state-run industries, as a drag on growth over several years. China\u2019s central bank has begun to pump extra funds into the economy to maintain borrowing while the virus takes hold, mainly to boost business investment, but Choyleva said these funds, while they are cheap and plentiful, are mainly used to keep zombie companies from going bust. Which industries are most vulnerable? The first sectors to reel from the outbreak were the travel and tourism industries, which usually enjoy a boom during the new year holiday period. Cancelled flights and hotel bookings in China and across the Asia region, which relies on Chinese tourists, have followed the clampdown on travel to and from the big cities of China\u2019s central belt and even from the mainland to Hong Kong. Airlines have scaled back services: Cathay Pacific plans to cut flight numbers by one-third over coming weeks and has encouraged staff to take weeks of unpaid leave. Neil Shearing, the chief economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cPassenger numbers have fallen by 55% compared with the lunar new year period in 2019. And given that Chinese tourists spend a lot in Asian countries, the costs of travel bans will be felt throughout the region. If the crisis persists, the global effect will be palpable. The Chinese made 173m visits in the 12 months to end of September last year and together they spent more than a quarter of a trillion dollars \u2013 more than any other country. But tourism is just the start. Entire supply chains \u2013 automotive, electronic, industrial \u2013 are starting to creak. Shipping companies are reporting a sharp drop in container volumes. China also has a huge domestic market for retail and food and beverages. One indicator that really hit the skids last week, partly as a result of the virus, was the price of coffee. Starbucks alone has 4,000 outlets in China. Half of them were closed by the outbreak. What about the stock market and other key indicators? Asian stock markets endured a seesaw week last week, tumbling early because of a slump in retail, consumer services and transport businesses, before recovering amid hopes that the virus outbreak could be contained. Western markets largely followed suit. But oil prices came under pressure too, amid anticipation of a slowdown in global demand, as did other raw materials. China is the world\u2019s largest crude importer and also a big consumer of metals such as copper and iron ore. Travel companies, carmakers and luxury product outlets were among the most volatile sectors. What do precedents tell us about the likely economic toll? In 2002-03, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing about 750. There are estimates that put the damage from Sars at anything between $30bn and $50bn \u2013 big numbers, but a drop in the ocean compared with global GDP which even then was worth about $35tn. The coronavirus is spreading at a rate six times faster than Sars, mostly through human contact between people not yet showing symptoms. China is a much more open economy than it was even in 2002, and so the disruption is expected to be greater than that caused by Sars. Which worldwide companies would be worst affected by a China slump? Many global companies rely on suppliers based in China. For example, 290 of Apple\u2019s 800 suppliers are based in China and the country is responsible for 9% of global TV production. According to DHL\u2019s Resilience 360 index, 50% of all manufacturing in Wuhan is related to the automotive industry and 25% to technology supplies from the region. Automotive executives in Europe and the US are warning they are just weeks away from shortages. Hyundai has already shut down operations in South Korea because of a lack of parts from China. To indicate how integrated some foreign firms have become in China, the US industrial glass and ceramics maker Corning has built 19 factories across the mainland and has more than 5,000 Chinese employees. The company is planning to increase its footprint after spending $1bn on a facility to produce its state-of-the-art generation 10.5 black glass used for LCD panels. Apple is supplied from factories in China and has a network of 42 Apple stores that it says will remain closed until 9 February. Other US retailers from Starbucks (4,200 shops) to Levi\u2019s have closed their stores, though Levi\u2019s only closed half its complement and China only accounts for 3% of its global sales. \u2026 and which countries? South-east Asia is most exposed, so tightly are local economies tied to the Chinese behemoth. (It\u2019s worth remembering that Asia\u2019s worst postwar financial crisis in 1997-98 was partly blamed on the devaluation of the Chinese currency). Japan may be a richer economy, but it too is exposed. China is a big buyer of Japan\u2019s industrial machines, its cars and trucks and technologically advanced consumer goods. Chinese-made parts go in the other direction, feeding components into Japanese factories. And then there are the millions of Chinese tourists who visit their eastern neighbour each year. Already Japan is bracing for cancellations from 400,000 people in the first quarter of 2020. Australia\u2019s economy is tightly interconnected with China too, and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, warned last week of \u201ca real weight on the economy\u201d. Even Australian universities are suffering because far fewer Chinese students have returned to enrol for the new academic year. How might Britain be affected? The UK, like other European countries, is in a position to limit the flow of Chinese visitors without a huge impact on the economy, though designer outlet shopping centres such as Oxfordshire\u2019s Bicester Village will see a severe downturn if Chinese visitors stay away for any length of time. The broader impact will be felt if global trade, as expected, begins to slow. Britain is plugged in to the all the big economies and for that reason always catches a cold when the global economy sneezes. Last year UK manufacturing went into recession in response to the tariff war between the US and China, which hit global trade. Could it derail the US economy sufficiently to affect the election this autumn? There is anecdotal evidence that the impact of the virus is rippling through small American businesses. US companies may find it difficult to access components for their manufactured goods, plunging a recovering manufacturing sector back into the long recession it suffered last year. Factory closures or shutdowns in the US heartland states of Ohio and Pennsylvania could cause problems for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, which relied heavily on bringing industrial jobs to these states. But November is still nine months away, and as yet it is hard to say whether the effects of the virus will last that long. So what will be the overall impact on the global economy? Economists are cautiously speculating that the perhaps 0.3 percentage points may be shaved off global growth, though it would remain somewhere around the 3% mark. Christian Keller, the head of economics research at Barclays, said the impact on the world economy could range from almost no change to his current global growth forecast of 3.3% for 2020 to growth of about 3%. Others are gloomier still, warning that if the virus continues to spread and Chinese activity remains deeply disrupted for months, a contraction of the global economy is not impossible, particularly as central banks have little effective monetary ammunition for emergencies. \u201cThere is a risk that an adverse feedback mechanism and limited space for policy response could push the global economy towards recession,\u201d said Keller.",

It\u2019s going to be a big week preparing for that and another big test but it\u2019s one we\u2019re looking forward to.\u201d Just don\u2019t mention the Farrells \u2026",

Public health is at risk if health is not made a priority in the forthcoming negotiations with the EU, according to the Brexit Health Alliance (BHA), an umbrella group led by the NHS Confederation which encompasses the NHS, medical research, industry, patients and public health bodies. The BHA has urged the government to prioritise continued cooperation with key EU agencies, such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and access platforms like the early warning and response system to deal with serious cross-border public health threats, such as pandemics and infectious diseases. \u201cInfectious diseases do not respect borders and we need to tackle them together,\u201d said Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation and BHA co-chair. \u201cIt is in all our interests to maintain these vital links between the UK and the EU not least because working together we are more likely to trace and tackle serious outbreaks effectively.\u201d Last week Boris Johnson said there was \u201cno need\u201d for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules and has previously stated that the UK could \u201cdevelop separate and independent policies\u201d in a range of fields. The alliance has also called for guarantees that critical medicines and medical devices will continue to be able to flow into and out of the UK and Europe, and that UK and EU residents should be able to access affordable healthcare when travelling in EU member states. It called on the government to ensure there was a continued role for the UK in Europe-wide research. \u201cOur worry is that all sides in these negotiations are under massive time pressures to agree a future trade deal and so there is a risk that the safety and health of patients and citizens across Europe could be overlooked,\u201d said Dickson. \u201cThere is no reason why leaving the EU should mean that the UK and the EU cannot maintain existing arrangements but if we are to achieve this health has to be seen as a priority, alongside business, in the negotiations. We would also like to see early agreements to protect patient safety, give citizens rights to healthcare, provide access to medicines and support medical research.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK firmly believes that cross-border health threats, such as pandemics, can only be effectively tackled through international collaboration and we remain committed to working with countries and partners across the world to protect the UK.\u201d",

All of the big awards, particularly for acting, have marched in lockstep all the way from the Globes onwards, and we are expecting the same at the Oscars. All together now: Joaquin, Ren\u00e9e, Brad, Laura.</p> <p>\u2022 If, as expected, 1917 nabs best picture and director, we might feel a fluttering of national pride over here in the UK. Not quite the British-are-coming levels, but, you know. Anything to distract us from the fact that we, as a country, are sinking fast under the weight of our post-imperial delusions.</p> <p>\u2022 The in memoriam segment is always a bit sad; two recent major departees may cause attendees to choke up more than usual: Kirk Douglas and Kobe Bryant. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what the Oscars have got planned.</p> <p>\u2022 Joaquin Phoenix <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/02/joaquin-phoenixs-attack-on-baftas-for-systemic-racism-meets-industry-wide-praise\">took a stand at the Baftas</a> over diversity; since he\u2019s considered a shoo-in to take home the best actor Oscar, we can expect a few more fireworks at the podium.</p> <p>\u2022 The dopey acceptance speech is always a classic: Ren\u00e9e Zellweger has all the attributes to produce a zinger when and if her name is called.</p> <p>\u2022 We don\u2019t know yet who will present the best director award, but let\u2019s hope someone will stick the boot into the all-male lineup \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ymYmfI-4uA\">\u00e0 la Natalie Portman at the 2018 Globes.</a></p>",

As is whether anyone will say anything actually funny. \u2022 A surprise, any surprise. All of the big awards, particularly for acting, have marched in lockstep all the way from the Globes onwards, and we are expecting the same at the Oscars. All together now: Joaquin, Ren\u00e9e, Brad, Laura. \u2022 If, as expected, 1917 nabs best picture and director, we might feel a fluttering of national pride over here in the UK. Not quite the British-are-coming levels, but, you know. Anything to distract us from the fact that we, as a country, are sinking fast under the weight of our post-imperial delusions. \u2022 The in memoriam segment is always a bit sad; two recent major departees may cause attendees to choke up more than usual: Kirk Douglas and Kobe Bryant. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what the Oscars have got planned. \u2022 Joaquin Phoenix took a stand at the Baftas over diversity; since he\u2019s considered a shoo-in to take home the best actor Oscar, we can expect a few more fireworks at the podium. \u2022 The dopey acceptance speech is always a classic: Ren\u00e9e Zellweger has all the attributes to produce a zinger when and if her name is called. \u2022 We don\u2019t know yet who will present the best director award, but let\u2019s hope someone will stick the boot into the all-male lineup \u2013 \u00e0 la Natalie Portman at the 2018 Globes.",
