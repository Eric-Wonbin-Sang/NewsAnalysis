For the moment the deficit is a single goal, courtesy of Le Fondre\u2019s first A-League hat-trick and Maclaren\u2019s first goalless game in recent memory.

The only real difference remaining is Maclaren\u2019s superior conversion rate (52.9 per cent, 45.9 minutes per goal) to Le Fondre (33.3 per cent, 72 minutes). So, when you have two consistent, positionally intelligent forwards who thrive on service, does that render their success or failure inextricably linked to that of their teams? Back at January\u2019s Asian Cup, even before Maclaren finally broke his international duck against Palestine and quashed the disparaging Scott McDonald comparisons, Socceroos assistant coach and former Manchester United assistant Rene Muelensteen was waxing lyrical about his superb movement. The 26-year-old might not often go hunting for the ball, but he knows precisely where it\u2019s going to drop. The thing is, it does need to be dropping for him. When City have been on, their new cult hero has showcased his wares with endearing alacrity. When they have not, he\u2019s been starved, and so too has the opposition net. One gets the distinct sense Maclaren, too, would have had a hat-trick had he been hassling and harassing in Le Fondre\u2019s shoes on Saturday evening, such was the class of the 33-year-old Englishman\u2019s service. Steve Corica\u2019s restyled Sky Blues attack has taken time to get going, a bit of oil added each week to lubricate the machine that churned out five goals against Brisbane and propelled them five points clear at the top. The first 45 minutes alone was evidence of the collective headway that\u2019s encouraged Le Fondre\u2019s exploits. When Kosta Barbarouses signed from Melbourne Victory in the off-season he probably didn\u2019t envisage a role more resembling provider than scorer. And yet the Kiwi conjurer constituted his side\u2019s crucial link via three first-half assists, two for Le Fondre and one for Milos Ninkovic.

Ninkovic produced the first graceful pass from deep, undoubtedly prompting frenzied cheque-book manoeuvring from his Macarthur admirers in the process. And Western Sydney, still in freefall at the hands of the VAR and their own inertia, may have observed with a hint of envy Alex Baumjohann\u2019s through ball to set up the second, before Rhyan Grant kickstarted the third. The point being that this marked a consummate night for Le Fondre, but one not possible without the arresting exhibition going on behind him: his \u201csupporting cast\u201d, as he called them last week. If a somewhat less-energetic final 45 minutes offered any insight, it\u2019s that the defending champions have another few gears to shift through yet. But so bloodthirsty was the whole disembowelment it\u2019s a wonder the pitch-side Robbie Fowler still had his small intestine sufficiently intact for his discerning post-match realisation that \u201cquality players hurt you, we got done by good play\u201d.

The Saudi Arabia Snooker Masters will take place from 4-10 October next year, with prize money of \u00a32.5m.

Human rights organisations have also warned about heavy restrictions on freedom of expression and women\u2019s rights, as well as the use of the death penalty for offences not recognised as crimes under international law. The heir to the Saudi throne, Mohammed bin Salman, has denied any involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s murder, calling it a \u201cmistake\u201d and \u201ca heinous crime\u201d by his country\u2019s agents. Crown Prince Mohammed, who runs the country on behalf of his father, was at the fight on Saturday and was fist-pumped by Joshua after his victory. Hearn, who hailed the fight as a massive success, confirmed the exchange afterwards. \u201cHe did a fist-pump to Joshua, and he did a fist-pump back,\u201d said Hearn. \u201cI spoke to the Saudi sports minister, Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal, afterwards. They just feel like it was a massive moment for the country.\u201d Speaking last night, Joshua said he did not mind the pressure he faced from human rights groups to speak out, but he felt unable to do so because he was not aware of all the issues. \u201cIt\u2019s good people ask me the questions \u2013 they want to hear my view about it,\u201d he added. \u201cI think you guys have made me more aware of the issues. I swear the fight was my main focus but that will change. I thought I was going to see some serious stuff going on \u2013 you would expect that from what you hear about Saudi \u2013 but I can only go on what I have experienced.\u201d Hearn also insisted that it was unfair to single out Joshua for criticism when so many other athletes were coming to Saudi Arabia, including ATP tennis players this week, Spanish football stars in January and the world\u2019s top cyclists a month later. \u201cWe have said all along that all these sports are coming here and yet you guys are writing articles criticising Joshua but not other people,\u201d he said. \u201cTyson Fury came here three weeks ago to make money for doing a WWE wrestling event, not a proper sporting event.\u201d Joshua is likely to fight next in England, with a fight at Tottenham\u2019s new 60,000-capacity stadium in either April or May, with the IBF champion Kubrat Pulev the preferred option. \u201cI\u2019m getting more and more experienced, understanding myself, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he added. \u201cEven though I took my loss [against Ruiz], I had to learn, didn\u2019t I? I didn\u2019t lose heart. I\u2019m back again, I\u2019m learning. And we\u2019re going to get back into the gym. I\u2019m going to go to Sheffield [his training camp] early, and just keep practising my skills. \u201cI need to stay active and have the hunger to learn,\u201d he continued. \u201cI took my loss to Ruiz in June and got my belts back, and here we go again. I have to defend my titles.\u201d Saudi Arabia has announced that it will host a ranking snooker event in Riyadh for the first time after signing a 10-year deal with World Snooker. The Saudi Arabia Snooker Masters will take place from 4-10 October next year, with prize money of \u00a32.5m. The champion will receive \u00a3500,000, the same amount as the winner of the sport\u2019s World Championship. \u201cThis is a giant leap forward for our sport,\u201d said World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn, Eddie Hearn\u2019s father. \u201cSnooker has grown to such an extent that we are now creating exceptional tournaments at this level.\u201d",

I felt so tired and drained and thought it must be down to training. In the changing room before the fight I got a bucket of ice and was putting my head in it thinking: \u2018Why do I feel so tired?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>The 30-year-old did not reveal what the problem was but said it was diagnosed after a checkup following the Ruiz fight and quickly dealt with. \u201cEven in this camp I had an operation done but as I\u2019d started training in June I had no issues. The responsibilities of being world champion are difficult. All that stuff, feeling so tired, dealing with obligations.

I think the phone has gone crazy and it\u2019s like, \u2018Bring him here, bring him here.\u2019 They\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve done here and there\u2019s a lot of options internationally but he does want to box back in the UK.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe spoke to Spurs about hosting this fight, which they were keen to do, but unfortunately the dates didn\u2019t work out. They would be keen to do it and it would be a nice stadium to do it in London.\u201d</p> \n<p>Joshua, meanwhile, insists a homecoming fight would be \u201cmega\u201d and he is unconcerned whom he meets next. \u201cThere\u2019s still a big interest in the heavyweight division, especially now we are taking the belts back,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it would be better against a Brit but, if not, I follow the mandatories and defend them that way.\u201d</p> \n<p>The 38-year-old Pulev has won 28 of his 29 fights \u2013 with his one defeat coming against Wladimir Klitschko in 2014 \u2013 but his ponderous violence would appear to be a ready\u2011made opponent for Joshua. Joshua insists, though, that he will take no one for granted. \u201cI\u2019m always going to have to prove myself, aren\u2019t I? That\u2019s the name of the game. Over the next three to six months I\u2019m going to have to do it again. It\u2019s no good winning this time and losing next time, saying: \u2018Look, I won six months ago, let\u2019s look at that.\u2019 Even though I\u2019ve proved it to myself, I\u2019m going to have to prove it to you guys once again. I can\u2019t get too comfortable.</p> \n<p>\u201cI felt like we upped our game preparing for Ruiz this time. We were doing longer rounds, we brought in a lot more sparring partners, I kept my mind thinking, challenging myself.Even in the fight on Saturday there were challenges, even if not physically. Mentally staying switched on was really challenging. And it worked really well.\u201d</p> \n<p>Joshua had talked about going back to school after his seventh-round defeat at Madison Square Garden against Ruiz and he proved as good as his word, repeatedly jabbing and moving to win a wide points victory over the Mexican-American.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/08/anthony-joshua-andy-ruiz-jr-world-heavyweight-boxing\">Ruiz sows seeds of destruction and Joshua reaps the benefit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Afterwards, when asked if he had ever felt better in a ring, he replied: \u201cNo, I felt good.

And we\u2019re going to get back into the gym.

Everyone does it. The belts can be your best friend or your best enemy. It just depends on you as a person. It\u2019s hard to say no. Even though I gave Andy the belts at the weigh-in, it\u2019s hard being champion. Trust me. It\u2019s not all fun. I remember when Tyson said: \u2018You couldn\u2019t walk in my shoes.\u2019 It\u2019s not what it seems like, this life of dedication. It\u2019s a fucking headache.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Anthony Joshua has set his sights on a springtime homecoming fight at Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s 60,000-seat stadium after regaining his WBA, IBF and WBO world heavyweight title belts against Andy Ruiz Jr. \u201cLondon\u2019s calling, I think,\u201d said Joshua, who is likely to face the IBF mandatory challenger the Bulgarian Kubrat Pulev in April or May. \u201cBritish supporters do play a big part in my career. Any time I\u2019m on home soil, I can\u2019t lose.\u201d Joshua also revealed that a health issue that required an operation left him \u201ctired\u201d and \u201cdrained\u201d in the buildup to his shock defeat against Ruiz in June \u2013 and that it was so troublesome he had to put a bucket of ice on his head before his ring walk at Madison Square Garden. \u201cI had some issue with my health which I was going through for a long time,\u201d Joshua admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was wrong with me. I felt so tired and drained and thought it must be down to training. In the changing room before the fight I got a bucket of ice and was putting my head in it thinking: \u2018Why do I feel so tired?\u2019\u201d The 30-year-old did not reveal what the problem was but said it was diagnosed after a checkup following the Ruiz fight and quickly dealt with. \u201cEven in this camp I had an operation done but as I\u2019d started training in June I had no issues. The responsibilities of being world champion are difficult. All that stuff, feeling so tired, dealing with obligations. Now I have energy, I haven\u2019t missed a session.\u201d The Briton intends to start light training for his second reign as heavyweight champion before Christmas, after pledging to keep learning \u201cthe sweet science\u201d \u2013 while his promoter, Eddie Hearn, plans to nail down an opponent and venue quickly for what will be Joshua\u2019s first contest in the UK since defeating the Russian Alexander Povetkin in September 2018. \u201cWembley doesn\u2019t look great, date-wise,\u201d said Hearn. \u201cTottenham Hotspur is a nice new stadium for a UK fight. We\u2019ve got to look at it. I think the phone has gone crazy and it\u2019s like, \u2018Bring him here, bring him here.\u2019 They\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve done here and there\u2019s a lot of options internationally but he does want to box back in the UK. \u201cWe spoke to Spurs about hosting this fight, which they were keen to do, but unfortunately the dates didn\u2019t work out. They would be keen to do it and it would be a nice stadium to do it in London.\u201d Joshua, meanwhile, insists a homecoming fight would be \u201cmega\u201d and he is unconcerned whom he meets next. \u201cThere\u2019s still a big interest in the heavyweight division, especially now we are taking the belts back,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it would be better against a Brit but, if not, I follow the mandatories and defend them that way.\u201d The 38-year-old Pulev has won 28 of his 29 fights \u2013 with his one defeat coming against Wladimir Klitschko in 2014 \u2013 but his ponderous violence would appear to be a ready\u2011made opponent for Joshua. Joshua insists, though, that he will take no one for granted. \u201cI\u2019m always going to have to prove myself, aren\u2019t I? That\u2019s the name of the game. Over the next three to six months I\u2019m going to have to do it again. It\u2019s no good winning this time and losing next time, saying: \u2018Look, I won six months ago, let\u2019s look at that.\u2019 Even though I\u2019ve proved it to myself, I\u2019m going to have to prove it to you guys once again. I can\u2019t get too comfortable. \u201cI felt like we upped our game preparing for Ruiz this time. We were doing longer rounds, we brought in a lot more sparring partners, I kept my mind thinking, challenging myself.Even in the fight on Saturday there were challenges, even if not physically. Mentally staying switched on was really challenging. And it worked really well.\u201d Joshua had talked about going back to school after his seventh-round defeat at Madison Square Garden against Ruiz and he proved as good as his word, repeatedly jabbing and moving to win a wide points victory over the Mexican-American. Afterwards, when asked if he had ever felt better in a ring, he replied: \u201cNo, I felt good. I\u2019m getting more and more experienced, understanding myself, and that\u2019s a good thing. Even though I took my loss, I didn\u2019t lose heart. I\u2019m back again, I\u2019m learning. And we\u2019re going to get back into the gym. I\u2019m going to go to Sheffield early and just keep practising my skills.\u201d Joshua also expressed his sympathy for Ruiz, who confessed afterwards that he had spent three months partying, eating and not training after becoming world champion. When asked if he could empathise, Joshua said: \u201cYeah, I did it. Everyone does it. The belts can be your best friend or your best enemy. It just depends on you as a person. It\u2019s hard to say no. Even though I gave Andy the belts at the weigh-in, it\u2019s hard being champion. Trust me. It\u2019s not all fun. I remember when Tyson said: \u2018You couldn\u2019t walk in my shoes.\u2019 It\u2019s not what it seems like, this life of dedication. It\u2019s a fucking headache.\u201d",

The best chance at this stage is if Swinson got behind Labour in Uxbridge. In return <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/30/tactical-voting-dominic-raab-faces-portillo-moment\">Labour could support the Lib Dems in Dominic Raab\u2019s seat in Esher</a>.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn will promise Britain\u2019s jaded voters that a Labour government would put \u201cmoney in your pocket\u201d, as his party makes a last-ditch push to deprive Boris Johnson of a majority at Thursday\u2019s general election. Amid concerns that Labour has overpromised with a blizzard of announcements during the six-week campaign, Corbyn will focus on the NHS and voters\u2019 finances in the final crucial days of campaigning. At a series of stops in Wales on Sunday, the Labour leader highlighted policies including increasing the national living wage to \u00a310 an hour, expanding free childcare, cutting household bills and providing free personal care for the over-65s. Labour is trying to restore party discipline in the final few days, after what has at times appeared to be a policy free-for-all. One candidate defending a Labour-held marginal complained the party\u2019s messaging during the six-week campaign had resembled \u201can Advent calendar\u201d with a different policy treat for every day. Labour has also retreated from the gung-ho approach of the early days of the campaign, when it poured resources into Tory-held seats in the hope of winning an outright majority. Corbyn\u2019s message that the NHS risks being sold off to US corporations as part of a post-Brexit trade deal does appear to have hit home, with activists and candidates saying it is being raised spontaneously by voters on doorsteps and in phone calls. Corbyn will be returning to that theme too, as the campaign reaches its climax. John McDonnell will echo Corbyn\u2019s \u201cmoney in your pocket\u201d message in a speech in London on Monday in which he will pledge to end austerity in his first budget. The shadow chancellor will set out a Labour government\u2019s priorities in its first 100 days in office \u2013 including boosting spending on public services, and kickstarting a green industrial revolution. \u201cIn too many parts of the country, we have been wasting people\u2019s potential. That\u2019s down to successive governments sitting back and leaving the fate of whole communities at the mercy of market forces,\u201d the shadow chancellor will say. \u201cOur \u2018green industrial revolution\u2019 will deliver the changes we need to avert climate catastrophe. And it will put British industry back on the map, bringing prosperity to every part of our country. It will give every community something to be proud of.\u201d While Labour has set out the sweeping changes to Britain\u2019s economy it would seek to make if it wins Thursday\u2019s general election, Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives have stuck relentlessly to their \u201cget Brexit done\u201d slogan. The prime minister will reprise that message yet again on Monday as he begins a tour of Labour-held seats the Tories hope to seize to secure a majority. But fresh doubt was cast on Johnson\u2019s claim that his deal is \u201coven-ready\u201d by news of a leaked government document seen by the Financial Times. Civil servants from the Department for Exiting the EU raised concerns in the document about whether the new customs system that will be necessary to enact the Northern Ireland protocol could be ready in time for the end of 2020. The protocol replaced the controversial \u201cbackstop\u201d in the withdrawal agreement and in effect requires a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain. The document, circulated last week, said, \u201cdelivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge.\u201d The government said it did not comment on leaks. Johnson will crisscross the country in the final three days of campaigning with a focus on traditional Labour heartlands, making stops in north Wales, West Yorkshire, Cheshire, Leicestershire, East Anglia and the south-west. At a rally in Sunderland, which voted leave early on the night of the referendum, he will say: \u201cIt\u2019s now been 1,264 days since Sunderland\u2019s roar was heard on the night of 23 June 2016. Since then, he will claim, \u201cparliament has bent every rule and broken every convention as it has delayed, diluted and denied Brexit. Remain MPs who said at the last election they would deliver Brexit shamefully did the exact opposite when they got to Westminster.\u201d Johnson himself voted against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal twice. But, he will insist: \u201cThe Labour party has let you down most of all. Under Jeremy Corbyn, they promised to honour the result of the referendum \u2013 before voting against Brexit every chance they had. They won their seats on a false prospectus and then stuck two fingers up to the public ... It\u2019s been the great betrayal.\u201d With the Brexit party increasingly pessimistic about its prospects of taking any seats \u2013 Nigel Farage said on Sunday he only had hopes for \u201ca handful\u201d \u2013 Johnson hopes to win in areas like Sunderland by uniting the leave vote. Labour insiders said their canvassing data in many leave areas has improved in recent weeks as the debate has widened beyond Brexit to the state of public services and the future of the health service. But the party is braced for a string of defeats in the Midlands, with West Bromwich East, where Tom Watson stood aside at the start of the campaign, Birmingham Northfields, and Dudley North among the constituencies believed to be vulnerable. However they are still hopeful of making a few gains, including Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s Chingford, where Johnson was out campaigning on Sunday in a move that suggests the Tories are worried that the former Tory leader could lose to Faiza Shaheen. Resources have been shifted modestly towards defending Labour-held seats in the past 10 days; but some candidates with wafer-thin majorities complain that the effort has been too little, too late. McDonnell will use his speech on Monday to set out fresh details of Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans, including creating \u201cpeople\u2019s assemblies\u201d as part of the oversight for the renationalised utilities. \u201cWhen Labour puts money in your pockets, we will also put power back in your hands. You rely on and work in these services, you know them. But you\u2019ve been ripped off and shut out from how they\u2019re run, to protect vested interests and profits for the wealthy. When we win power it will be to give it to you,\u201d he will say. With national polls suggesting the Tories are on course to secure a majority, anti-Brexit groups are urging voters to vote tactically, \u201con an industrial scale\u201d. Hugo Dixon, deputy chair of People\u2019s Vote, is urging the public to abandon long-held party allegiances in favour of the candidates best placed to stop Boris Johnson from getting a majority. He said the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, needed to take the lead by getting behind the Labour candidate in Johnson\u2019s seat in Uxbridge to start a gargantuan push to encourage tactical voting. Dixon said: \u201cAt this very late stage there still is a chance if there is industrial-scale tactical voting. By focusing on the most high-profile single seat [Uxbridge] it could create a chain reaction. Someone has to make the first move. The best chance at this stage is if Swinson got behind Labour in Uxbridge. In return Labour could support the Lib Dems in Dominic Raab\u2019s seat in Esher. We need something seismic to happen to supercharge it.\u201d Dixon admitted that a Johnson government would mean an effective end to any hopes of a second referendum, which he said would be a tragedy.",

I\u2019ll work on the mentality.\u201d Victory against City took United to fifth place with 24 points, five away from a Champions League berth, and Solskj\u00e6r praised how the champions were taken apart. \u201cWe know we can play quick, attacking football when we get the shape right, as we did,\u201d he said. \u201cThe attitude was spot-on and every time we had the ball it seemed like we could carve them open. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was two passes or four passes or 10. The first half was attacking football as it should be played.\u201d Jesse Lingard was a standout performer in the Spurs and City wins following injury and a prolonged dip in form. He was also reprimanded in the summer by the manager for a video posted on social media and Solskj\u00e6r alluded to this. \u201cHe\u2019s Man United through and through. He\u2019s a red, he\u2019s got a great attitude and a great work rate. Every one of us have things to deal with on the pitch and off the pitch and what he has had to deal with, that will be between us. It\u2019s great to see him back. \u201cYou can criticise anyone about anything but for me as a manager, I have to look after these boys in the good and the bad times. It\u2019s great to work with him. I had him in the reserves; gave him his debut against Burnley. It\u2019s good to see him back to his old self.\u201d",

There were two empty podiums, but no melting ice sculptures this time around.</p> \n  <p>Boris Johnson was widely criticised for his \u201ccowardly\u201d behaviour in failing to show up for interviews and debates, but chair Cathy Newman did fill in the Conservative policies on each of the debate topics. </p> \n  <p>There were no major policy surprises, with all panellists launching attacks on NHS underfunding and emphasising the need for climate action. <br></p> \n  <p>Jo Swinson was the target of much scathing criticism from her fellow panellists, who took the opportunity to raise her record on austerity measures during the coalition government, when she was a minister. Labour\u2019s Angela Rayner and the SNP\u2019s Philippa Whitford led in taking Swinson to task, saying she couldn\u2019t condemn the impact of austerity measures she helped to create.</p> \n  <p>Swinson apologised explicitly for her role in policies such as the bedroom tax, and the infamous tuition fee promises. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-08T20:22:04.555Z\">at 8.22pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ded55ea8f08e7796de8f130\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-08T20:05:20.066Z\">8.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The discussion on: trust</strong></p> \n  <p>There seem to be a wide acknowledgement across the panel that voters lacked trust in their politicians. </p> \n  <p>Jo Swinson explicitly admitted her coalition government had broken a promise on election fees, but said the last time she lied was \u201cabout how many chocolate biscuits were in the tin\u201d to her son, a joke which fell rather flat. </p> \n  <p>Asked how Jewish voters could trust Labour, Angela Rayner insisted that the party were working to tackle anti-semitism. She emphasised the need for open debate, in a thinly veiled jab at Boris Johnson, calling politics and democracy \u201cthe best of British\u201d and saying prospective leaders shouldn\u2019t \u201chide from scrutiny\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Plaid Cymru\u2019s Adam Price was more explicit, calling Johnson a \u201ccoward\u201d. \u201cThose who lead us should not mislead us and get away with it,\u201d he added.</p> \n  <p>Jonathan Bartley came out with the best line of the round, and was met with broad laughter.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhy should you trust us?

      "bodyText": "That concludes the debate tonight. Representatives from all of the main parties were present, except the Conservatives and the Brexit Party who had declined an invitation to join. There were two empty podiums, but no melting ice sculptures this time around. Boris Johnson was widely criticised for his \u201ccowardly\u201d behaviour in failing to show up for interviews and debates, but chair Cathy Newman did fill in the Conservative policies on each of the debate topics. There were no major policy surprises, with all panellists launching attacks on NHS underfunding and emphasising the need for climate action. Jo Swinson was the target of much scathing criticism from her fellow panellists, who took the opportunity to raise her record on austerity measures during the coalition government, when she was a minister. Labour\u2019s Angela Rayner and the SNP\u2019s Philippa Whitford led in taking Swinson to task, saying she couldn\u2019t condemn the impact of austerity measures she helped to create. Swinson apologised explicitly for her role in policies such as the bedroom tax, and the infamous tuition fee promises. The discussion on: trust There seem to be a wide acknowledgement across the panel that voters lacked trust in their politicians. Jo Swinson explicitly admitted her coalition government had broken a promise on election fees, but said the last time she lied was \u201cabout how many chocolate biscuits were in the tin\u201d to her son, a joke which fell rather flat. Asked how Jewish voters could trust Labour, Angela Rayner insisted that the party were working to tackle anti-semitism. She emphasised the need for open debate, in a thinly veiled jab at Boris Johnson, calling politics and democracy \u201cthe best of British\u201d and saying prospective leaders shouldn\u2019t \u201chide from scrutiny\u201d. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Adam Price was more explicit, calling Johnson a \u201ccoward\u201d. \u201cThose who lead us should not mislead us and get away with it,\u201d he added. Jonathan Bartley came out with the best line of the round, and was met with broad laughter. \u201cWhy should you trust us? You don\u2019t join the Green Party for political ambition\u201d. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want refugee children coming to our country, I don\u2019t want your vote\u201d, he added. The SNP took the opportunity to call for votes at 16. Jo Swinson admits the Liberal Democrats got it wrong on tuition fees, conceding that they broke a promise The discussion on: health and social care A pretty unanimous verdict from tonight\u2019s panellists that the NHS is under-funded, with over-crowding and long waiting times key issues. Angela Rayner, who was a home carer, condemned cuts for causing either undignified or totally inaccessible care. \u201cWhen my Nan was dying, she said \u2018If I was a dog, you\u2019d put me down\u2019, and no older person should feel like that\u201d, Rayner said. The discussion on: the economy As well as heated criticism of Jo Swinson, this debate centred around child poverty, which Adam Price insisted could be eliminated given the political will. Philippa Witford of the SNP claimed that the UK lost 14,000 children per year before their 15th birthday. Commenting on this, she said: \u201cThat\u2019s the size of a secondary school - can you imagine if a secondary school had it\u2019s roof falling in every year? Maybe then we\u2019d get off our bahookies and do something about it.\u201d Swinson under fire for role in the coalition government Jo Swinson is getting a lot of criticism from her fellow panelists over her role in the coalition government, with Angela Rayner saying Swinson couldn\u2019t criticise the impact of austerity caused by a government she was part of. Swinson apologised for her part in the policies such as the bedroom tax, but the SNP\u2019s Philippa Whitford said that would not compensate for the policies which had \u201cdestroyed lives and families\u201d. Swinson told of how her son\u2019s school had been offering free bagels to combat child hunger. \u201cThey don\u2019t want a bagel, they want a job\u201d, Rayner retorted. The discussion on: the climate crisis There was a lot of common ground on this issue, with all representatives agreeing much needed to be done to tackle the climate crisis. The target for reaching zero-carbon varies across the representatives, with the Green\u2019s having the most ambitious target of 2030. When criticised for the Green\u2019s commitment to spend \u00a3100bn a year on climate action, Jonathan Bartley said: \u201cIf the climate was a bank, we\u2019d have bailed it out by now.\u201d The SNP were criticised for being \u201ctoo late\u201d with their target of 2045, but Witman said that Scotland got most of its energy from renewable sources. The most well-received statement of this round came from Plaid Cymru\u2019s Adam Price, who said that the climate was \u201cbigger than party politics\u201d, with \u201cone in seven of our species at risk of extinction\u201d. The discussion on: terrorism Angela Rayner and Jo Swinson refused to be drawn specifically on whether convicted terrorists should always serve their full sentence, but both said the safety of the public should come first. Swinson also criticised Boris Johnson for politicising the death of Jack Merritt in the London Bridge attack, citing his father Dave Merritt who specifically requested his son\u2019s death was not used in this way. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Adam Price said they should serve the length of their sentence, and the balance had to \u201cerr on the side of caution\u201d because the consequences of mistaken release were so high. The SNP\u2019s representative appeared to take a different approach, saying that \u201cto change people\u2019s futures you have to actually solve their problems. There are far too many people in prison who should be helped in a public health approach\u201d. However, Witson condemned automatic release of prisoners. The discussion on: mental health In a discussion on mental health, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price revealed his own battle with depression, saying he had reached \u201cthe darkest points of all\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m one of the one in four\u201d, he said, referring to the number of people in the UK thought to be suffering with mental health problems. Labour\u2019s Angela Rayner and the SNP\u2019s Philippa Witford had more in common on this topic, both saying that health problems should be prevented early through social services. \u201cHealth isn\u2019t about the NHS, that\u2019s what picks you up when you fall. Poverty drives people into mental health issues\u201d, Witford said, to rapturous applause. The discussion on: the NHS The first clash of the debate has come over the NHS, which all parties insisted they would preserve. Green party leader Jonathan Bartley said the NHS shouldn\u2019t be used as \u201cpolitical football\u201d, but claims Labour \u201cbuilt the bridge the Tories are walking towards privatisation\u201d. Angela Rayner asked why A&amp;E in Scotland are failing to meet NHS targets, but Philippa Witford insists Labour are missing theirs in Wales, where they run the health service. \u201cPeople have the right to #GoCompare\u201d, said Witford, in what is surely the first of many one-liners of the evening. Cathy Newman, chairing the debate, confirms that both the Conservatives and the Brexit Party were invited to join the debate but declined. Instead, we\u2019ll be hearing from Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, SNP health spokesperson Philippa Whitford and co-leader of the Green party, Jonathan Bartley. Good evening, I\u2019m Molly Blackall and I\u2019ll be taking over the live blog tonight. Coming up, we have the \u2018Everything But Brexit\u2019 debate on Channel 4, where senior politicians from the main parties are set to be quizzed by audience members on key election issues - with no mention of the B-word. Earlier in the week, the Independent reported that neither the Conservatives nor Brexit party would send a representative to the debate, but it\u2019s currently unclear who will be attending. We\u2019ll have all the updates as they unfold, from 6.30pm. The Conservative David Davies, who is defending his seat in Monmouth, South Wales, has floated the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. In an interview with the BBC, the pro-Leave former minister also dismissed criticism that the Tories\u2019 campaign slogan \u201cget Brexit done\u201d was misleading, since trade negotiations would likely go on throughout 2020 if the UK did indeed leave the EU early next year. Asked whether a no-deal Brexit was possible after the transition period, Davies said: It\u2019s a possibility, you have to accept that. We don\u2019t want a no-deal Brexit. It\u2019s not the first choice of anyone in the Conservative party. We want a deal, we want a good relationship with Europe, but we want them to accept that we\u2019re leaving. However, anyone who\u2019s done any kind of negotiating knows you cannot negotiate anything unless you\u2019re prepared to walk away. ITV\u2019s Hannah Miller subjected the prime minister to a tough line of questioning from the side of a football pitch near Stockport and has won plaudits throughout today for holding him to account. Boris Johnson\u2019s evasive responses may well explain why he has avoided being interviewed by the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. Shots fired. Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, floated the suggestion for the second time that her party could be amenable to an accord with Labour in a hung parliament, in order to secure a people\u2019s vote, if Jeremy Corbyn stood down after the election. Corbyn urged activists to \u201cgo flat out until 10 o\u2019clock on Thursday\u201d and celebrated that for the first time in British history, the Labour party could have more female than male MPs in the next parliament (see 1.55pm). Boris Johnson conceded there would be some customs checks for goods crossing the Irish Sea after Brexit but insisted they would apply only to items destined for the Republic of Ireland. He also refused to say whether he would resign if he fails to win a majority. The Scottish Tories claimed that a pact between Labour and the SNP was being drawn up and warned unionists in Scotland to vote for Conservative to prevent a second independence referendum from taking place. The Labour candidate for Glasgow North East, Paul Sweeney, said Labour would support a second referendum only if an explicit mandate for such a vote came out from the 2021 Scottish elections. \u201cUltimately, we\u2019re democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe respect the right of the Scottish people to self-determination.\u201d Comedian and Labour supporter Steve Coogan urged voters to be smart as he campaigned with the Lib Dem candidate Oliver Henman on Sunday in his local constituency of Lewes in East Sussex. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, expressed his concern that the row over antisemitism in Labour may have an effect on the election result but that the party had \u201cdone everything we can possibly do\u201d to tackle the problem. The Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, apologised for Islamophobia in the party. \u201cWell, course, I\u2019m sorry and I\u2019m sorry when people do or say things that are wrong. But I am confident that my party has a robust mechanism for dealing with it.\u201d Ruth Davidson, a former Scottish Conservative leader, has hinted at a return to frontline politics to lead the Tories in Westminster once they are next in opposition. Ed Davey, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, dismissed Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that riding his bike on a pavement is the naughtiest thing he has ever done (see 9.38am), saying the prime minister has done many other \u201cfar naughtier\u201d things. The anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign released data showing the Tories are on course for a 40-seat majority, but it claims that tactical voting in 36 marginal seats would block this outcome (see 11.56am). Activists from Extinction Rebellion cycled to Heathrow airport to protest against plans to build a third runway, while highlighted the prime minister\u2019s previous ardent opposition to the transport hub\u2019s expansion. Repurposing his famous scrum metaphor, Boris Johnson urged Tory activists to keep the ball within the pack and to learn from the lessons of 2017 when his party squandered a healthy lead in the polls come the election. And here\u2019s the morning summary. Do drop me a line on my Twitter if I\u2019ve missed anything. Ruth Davidson, a former Scottish Conservative leader, has hinted at a return to frontline politics to lead the Tories in Westminster when they are next in opposition, my colleague Frances Perraudin reports. In an interview for the Sunday Telegraph\u2019s Stella Magazine, the MSP for Edinburgh Central suggested she could re-enter politics once her one-year-old son was older. It may well be that my time in politics doesn\u2019t come again until we\u2019re in opposition. I\u2019ve probably got more experience than anyone in the party on how to lead from opposition. If someone tapped on my door and asked me to help, I\u2019d be there in a heartbeat. But at the moment, I\u2019ve got four or five years when my son isn\u2019t at school and that is not a time that I\u2019m contemplating moving 450 miles away for the majority of the week. It\u2019s just some things are more important than politics. Surprising scenes in Sunderland this afternoon where a group of dancers removed their overgarments to reveal they were wearing Brexit party T-shirts. It\u2019s unclear whether they are actual supporters, or if they were merely paid to perform a routine. Equally, it remains unknown whether Kanye West \u2013 who has cultivated a friendly relationship with Nigel Farage ally Donald Trump \u2013 has consented to his song Power being used repeatedly by the Brexit party during the election campaign. The former Labour home secretary, Alan Johnson, has backed an app that is offering motorists free parking on Thursday near polling stations. Heavy rain and high winds are forecast in places on Thursday for the first December general election in almost a century, with only eight hours of daylight expected. To encourage people to go and vote, however, JustPark is allowing people half an hour of free parking through its website. \u201cI am pleased to be part of a campaign that aims to get more people voting on 12 December,\u201d Johnson said. This will be the first December election for 96 years and for the elderly and infirm in particular, there will be real worries about the cold and dark conditions. Being able to park, free of charge, close to the polling station will make a significant contribution to voter turnout. Vote smart and box clever to defeat the Conservative party, the actor Steve Coogan has urged. Campaigning with the Lib Dem candidate Oliver Henman on Sunday in his local constituency of Lewes in East Sussex, the comedian said he would be voting Liberal Democrat on Thursday because it was the \u201csmartest thing to do\u201d. Although he is a Labour supporter, the party came a distant third in 2017 in Lewes and it is one of a number of seats where the Lib Dems are best placed to beat the Tories and a vote for any other party would likely be wasted. Conservative MP Maria Caulfield holds the seat, where people voted narrowly to remain during the 2016 EU referendum, with a majority of 5,508. Just over 6,000 voted Labour. Coogan, best known for his portrayal of Alan Partridge, said he would be visiting other constituencies where he would urge people to vote Labour in order to keep out the Tories if they were the main opponent. It\u2019s such a crucial issue facing the nation. The most important thing across the country is to defeat the Tories by any means necessary. It\u2019s about being smart and boxing clever. Ed Davey, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, has poured scorn on Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that riding his bike on a pavement is the naughtiest thing he has ever done (see 9.38am), saying the prime minister has done many other \u201cfar naughtier\u201d things. From lying to the Queen to insulting single mothers, Boris Johnson has done far naughtier things than cycling on the pavement. He has tried to laugh off his dismal track record of lying to the public and attacking women and minority groups. But this is no joke. One of the other things he could have mentioned was his previous use of drugs such as cannabis and cocaine, and earlier Jo Swinson told PA Media she had smoked \u201ca fair bit of cannabis at university\u201d, when asked the same question. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that counts as particularly naughty, but your readers and viewers will be able to make up their own mind on that,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just one, and I did inhale.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, said in 2017 that his own admission would be \u201cfar too naughty to say\u201d. This week, he was asked to reveal \u201cthe most romantic \u2026 wild and reckless\u201d moment of his life, to which he confessed to having enjoyed some \u201cwonderful holidays\u201d with his wife and referred suggestively to having a \u201cgreat time together\u201d when \u201cyou\u2019re with somebody\u201d. Elsewhere, activists from Extinction Rebellion are protesting against plans to build a third runway at Heathrow airport. Guy Shrubsole, from Friends of the Earth, notes the prime minister\u2019s previous opposition to the transport hub\u2019s expansion. Johnson said famously in 2015 that he would \u201clie down with you in front of those bulldozers and stop the building, stop the construction of that third runway\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn has declared that Labour would invest to achieve prosperity and restated its pledge of free personal care for older people to end the crisis in social care. During a speech in Bangor \u2013 in the ultra-marginal Arfon constituency, held by Plaid Cymru with a majority of just 92 ahead of Labour in 2017 \u2013 he paid tribute to the determination of party campaigners and waxed lyrical about the beauty of the Welsh countryside. Corbyn urged activists to \u201cgo flat out until 10 o\u2019clock on Thursday\u201d and said that for the first time in British history, the Labour party intended to have at least an equal number of female MPs in the next parliamentary party. The [Labour] government of Wales is doing its best in very difficult circumstances. But it\u2019s lost a billion pounds in funding because of austerity imposed by the Tories and the Liberal Democrats in Westminster in 2010. And then you drive through Wales \u2026 beautiful countryside, fantastic hills, wonderful diversity of topography and everything else. And then behind all that, is stunted aspirations and a great deal of poverty because of a lack of investment and the cruelty of how austerity has worked. In modern Britain, there are 4 million children living in poverty. This Christmas, 135,000 children will wake up not knowing if the place they\u2019re waking up will be there home for much longer because they\u2019re on short term tenancies. The price of austerity is not paid by the very rich [or] the 150 billionaires in Britain. It\u2019s paid for by those going through mental health stress, those who are homeless, our children going hungry, by the underfunding of public services all over Britain. None of this is at all necessary. You can\u2019t cut your way to prosperity. You invest your way to prosperity. However, in spite of the funding cuts from Westminster, Plaid Cymru accused Labour of \u201chypocrisy\u201d over its social care policy. Plaid\u2019s MP in Carmarthen, Jonathan Edwards, suggested Labour could have already delivered free social care in Wales but chose not to and criticised the party for not giving \u201ccredible answers\u201d about its government in Wales. Edwards said in a statement: Labour in Wales could deliver free social care tomorrow if they wanted to. But they choose not to. Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru is promising free social care at the point of need for everyone in Wales. In Wales, Labour has had 20 years in government to deliver real change but has failed to do so and instead find themselves defending worse A&amp;E waiting times than England, health board scandal after health board scandal and a worrying fall in the number of GPs. That\u2019s why twice on TV debates this election, poorly briefed Labour politicians have failed to give credible answers to questions on their own Labour government\u2019s record in Wales. Richard Burgon simply smiled when asked why Labour had chosen not to deliver free social care in Wales, where they have the power to do so. You only have to look to Labour in government in Wales to see that Labour promises and Labour in government mean different things. Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, has suggested once more that her party could amenable to an accord with Labour in a hung parliament, in order to secure a people\u2019s vote, if Jeremy Corbyn stood down after the election. She told PA Media: Obviously we don\u2019t know who the personalities would be in that circumstance, but we will obviously take a view on that depending on what circumstance we find ourselves in. I have been working with people from the Labour party, and people from the Conservative party, and the SNP, and Plaid Cymru, and the Green party to try and stop Brexit and try and secure a people\u2019s vote so that we can remain in the EU. I\u2019ve been doing that for the last couple of years and I will certainly be continuing to do that. Obviously, Jeremy Corbyn \u2026 is completely unfit to be prime minister, as is Boris Johnson for a whole host of different reasons. And so, if Labour are in a situation where they consider that Jeremy Corbyn is no longer fit to lead them, then we will of course look to keep working with people to try and secure a people\u2019s vote. On Friday, Swinson told LBC that the party would not go into coalition with any other party. She told a caller: \u201cThere\u2019s lots of places that we can win as Liberal Democrats where previously they might have been Conservative strongholds and will not put Corbyn in No 10. I will work constructively cross-party. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in coalition territory.\u201d Remember when Boris Johnson, then mayor of London, mused back in 2013 that \u201cif the ball came loose from the back of the scrum\u201d he would like to be prime minister? Now, as PM, he has urged Tory activists to keep the ball within the pack and to learn from the lessons of 2017 when his party squandered a healthy lead in the polls come the election. We\u2019re now in the final furlong of this race and that is when of course the horses can still change places. We\u2019re in their 25, to use a rugby metaphor, or is it 22 metres now? I can\u2019t remember. Anyway, we\u2019re still not quite there yet and do not forget what happened in 2017. To get back to rugby, we\u2019ve got to drive for the line, keep the ball firmly at the back of our feet and we\u2019re going to get there but only if we work really hard. Keep the ball firmly at the back of the scrum and drive for the line, if you know what I mean. Good afternoon, I\u2019m Mattha Busby, taking the reins from my colleague Matthew Weaver. Earlier, the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, said Labour would have \u201cquestions to answer\u201d if it does not accept the SNP\u2019s post-election demands. Shortly after, the Labour candidate for Glasgow North East, Paul Sweeney, said his party would not \u201cstand in the way\u201d of a second referendum if independence-supporting parties return a majority to Holyrood in 2021. However, he stressed there was no clear mandate for a second vote and Labour \u201cwould not be going into that at this stage\u201d although he noted Ian Blackford would \u201cmeet regularly\u201d with Jeremy Corbyn while parliament is sitting. He told Sunday Politics Scotland: Ultimately, we\u2019re democrats. We respect the right of the Scottish people to self-determination. If there were an explicit mandate for that, say, after the Scottish elections in 2021, it wouldn\u2019t be for any British government to stand in the way of that. The interim Scottish Tory leader, Jackson Carlaw, said Sweeney\u2019s comments were confirmation of a deal between the two parties and he restated what has become a traditional line of attack for his party. Paul Sweeney has set it out in black and white. A Labour-SNP pact is being drawn up; it\u2019s just a matter of dotting the i\u2019s and crossing the t\u2019s. This is what could happen by Friday if Sturgeon and Corbyn succeed. It means our union is on the line this week. Ian Blackford said today that he and Jeremy Corbyn speak regularly, and he doesn\u2019t expect Corbyn to oppose the Nationalists. So pro-UK voters in Scotland face the very real risk of an Indyref2 pact being stitched up by the end of this week. Pro-UK voters in Scotland must act on Thursday to stop this happening. And it is only by voting Scottish Conservative and Unionist that we can do that. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrat candidate, Christine Jardine, has said her party would \u201cnot put Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street, full stop\u201d. However, the Lib Dems would back legislation for another Brexit referendum, she said. Speaking to Andrew Marr this morning, Sturgeon had said every Tory-held seat in Scotland faced the SNP as the main opposition and she raised the spectre of what damage a Boris Johnson-led government would cause. She said Labour would have \u201csome big explaining\u201d to do if it refused the conditional support of the Scottish Nationalist party. Well look, I lead a minority government so I probably know more than most politicians in the UK what it takes. You can\u2019t do anything in a minority government unless you have the support of another party. I don\u2019t believe Labour if against of all of the odds and what the opinion polls are suggesting they get into a position where they can govern and implement their manifesto. They would turn their backs on that. But can I just say my key priority in this election, because I think it\u2019s in Scotland\u2019s interest and the UK\u2019s interest, is to try to stop Boris Johnson getting a majority on Thursday. Every Tory-held seat in Scotland has the SNP as the main challenger and my appeal to people is to make sure we\u2019re not waking up on Friday with the prospect of five years of Boris Johnson because I think it would do real damage. We will offer our support to a minority Labour government with certain conditions attached to that and I guess my view here would be to think about that prospect and imagine on Friday Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell are in the position of being able to form a government. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to turn their backs on that, and if they do \u2013 I think they\u2019ve got some big explaining to do. Boris Johnson and members of his cabinet have had a taste of being call centre operatives in a bid to drum up Tory support. The prime minister spent a couple of minutes appearing to work out how to use the system, before the chancellor, Sajid Javid, handed him a headset to wear. After he announced his name to the voter, Johnson helpfully added: \u201cI\u2019m the prime minister\u201d, before having a short chat. Dominic Raab, Michael Gove and Theresa Villiers were among the other senior ministers who were making calls at the Conservative party offices in Millbank, central London. The shadow chancellor has expressed his concern that the row over antisemitism in Labour may have an effect on the election result, adding that the party had \u201cdone everything we can possibly do\u201d to tackle the problem. In a BBC One interview on Sunday morning, John McDonnell apologised to the Jewish community for \u201cthe suffering we\u2019ve inflicted on them\u201d. He added: \u201cI say to them, we\u2019re doing everything possible and we are going to learn more lessons and we want to be the shining example of anti-racism that the Labour party should be.\u201d Asked if he thought antisemitism in the party would be partly to blame if Labour lost Thursday\u2019s general election, he said: \u201cI worry that this has had its effect. We\u2019ve done everything that I think we can possibly do. We\u2019ve apologised to the Jewish community \u2026 We\u2019ve always got to learn lessons, of course we have, all political parties. Because it isn\u2019t just the Labour party.\u201d The anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign has released MRP data showing the Conservatives are on course for a 40-seat majority, but it claims that tactical voting in 36 marginal seats would block this outcome. It has calculated that just 40,704 tactical votes in these seats would prevent a Conservative majority. The seat-by-seat analysis of 28,272 voters found that without tactical voting the Conservative party would win 345 seats. It reckons that less than 2,500 tactical votes in the 36 marginals would stop this outcome. The list of marginals and the votes required in each to block the Conservatives is published here. In Dewsbury, it would take only 82 Green and Lib Dem voters backing Labour to prevent the Conservative party winning the seat. Other seats on the list include West Bromwich West, Carshalton and Wallington and Sedgefield. Best for Britain says that if tactical voting were successful in these 36 seats, the Conservatives would win 309 seats, Labour 255, Lib Dems 14, Greens one, Plaid three, and the SNP 49 seats. Its chief executive, Naomi Smith, said: \u201cThis election is on a knife-edge, and if enough remainers hold their nose and vote for the candidate with the best chance of stopping the Tories in their seat we\u2019re heading for a hung parliament and a final-say referendum.\u201d Cleverly was also asked about the investigation the Tory party has promised into Islamophobia and whether it would be included only in a wider look at prejudice more generally. He said: \u201cIt will specifically look into Islamophobia in my party. And it will, by definition, also have to look at other stuff as well, because you can\u2019t always unpick this.\u201d The Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, has apologised for Islamophobia in the party. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, he said: \u201cWell, course, I\u2019m sorry and I\u2019m sorry when people do or say things that are wrong. But I am confident that my party has a robust mechanism for dealing with it.\u201d Cleverly also falsely claimed that Boris Johnson had apologised for a notorious article he wrote in 2018 when he said women wearing niqabs resembled \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d. Last week the Guardian revealed that at least four ministers have gone on election campaigning trips to endorse Tory candidates facing allegations of Islamophobia since the claims against them came to light. PA Media picks up on the very modest ambition Farage has for the election. Asked how many seats the Brexit party could win, Farage told Sky: Well, I think there\u2019s a handful in which we\u2019ve got a seriously good chance of winning and I think we will get some in, I genuinely do.\u201d He added: Of course I want Brexit done, but I want the right Brexit done \u2026 We will be back in crisis by June unless this withdrawal agreement is amended and that is the fight I\u2019ve got and I want just to get a bridgehead of Brexit party MPs in parliament to hold Boris Johnson to account, because otherwise we\u2019re going to see Brexit sold out.\u201d The SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, says his party would be a \u201cmoderating force\u201d on a Labour minority government, while insisting there is no reason why Jeremy Corbyn should deny a second independence referendum. He said: \u201cI know that Jeremy Corbyn has supported the right of self-determination all round the world and there\u2019s no reason why he would not recognise that the mandate [for a second independence referendum] it already there and he has to compromise on that. For us it\u2019s very simple.\u201d Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Sunday Politics Scotland programme, Blackford was also challenged about how the SNP intended to moderate the Labour manifesto, particularly with the Scottish Tories making the argument that a vote for the SNP is vote for Labour. Blackford refused to name specific policies, but said: \u201cWe will go through this on a case by case basis and we will be a moderating force on Labour\u201d. On Trident renewal, which Nicola Sturgeon has previously described as a red line in negotiations, he added: \u201cJeremy Corbyn doesn\u2019t want to press the button. Are we really talking about the situation where a Labour government would want to commit up to \u00a32bn of our money on weapons that will never be reused?\u201d Here\u2019s a summary of what we learned from a packed final round of Sunday morning broadcast interviews: The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has admitted that the issue of antisemitism has hit Labour\u2019s campaign. \u201cI worry this has had its effect,\u201d he told the BBC, but claimed the party had done \u201ceverything we can possible do\u201d to tackle antisemitism. He added: \u201cI apologise to the Jewish community for the suffering we have inflicted on them.\u201d Boris Johnson has conceded there will be some customs checks for goods crossing the Irish Sea after Brexit but insisted they would apply only to items destined for the Republic of Ireland. In an interview on Sky News, he initially said \u201cthere won\u2019t be checks\u201d before admitting there would be for goods going on to the Republic of Ireland. Johnson claimed that the naughtiest thing he had ever done and was \u201cprepared to admit\u201d was riding his bicycle on the pavement. Asked if that was really the case, he replied: \u201cNo, no, it was a very careful rubric. What you said was the naughtiest thing that I was prepared to admit.\u201d The prime minister refused to say whether he would resign if he fails to win a majority. Ducking the question, he said: \u201cThe choice on Thursday is unbelievably stark, it\u2019s between going forward with a one nation Conservative government that can get Brexit done. The Brexit party is to be renamed the Reform party, if the UK leaves the EU in January. Asked about the party\u2019s future, its leader, Nigel Farage, said: \u201cIt will have to reform into the Reform party. It\u2019ll have to campaign to change politics for good.\u201d The shadow health secretary has announced a \u00a310bn National Care Service to provide \u201cfree personal social care\u201d. He said: \u201cIt means that no one will have to pay anything for the care that they get in their home, support getting out of bed \u2026 this is about ensuring fairness in the system. Boris Johnson has admitted there will be some customs checks for goods crossing the Irish Sea after Brexit but insisted they would apply only to items destined for the Republic of Ireland. In an interview on Sky News on Sunday morning, the prime minister promised that \u201cthere won\u2019t be checks\u201d despite warnings to the contrary in leaked Treasury documents. The document, seized on by Labour last week, also raises the prospect that there could be tariffs on trade going the other way. However, Johnson did admit there would be checks if goods that are then going on to the Republic of Ireland. The SNP\u2019s leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has said she is not asking Labour to support the idea of another independence referendum, but to \u201crespect the principle\u201d. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Sturgeon said: \u201cMy message (to the Labour party) would be listen carefully, I\u2019ll never do anything that puts Boris Johnson into Downing Street, but Labour, in order to get a Queen\u2019s speech and a budget through, if they\u2019re in a minority position, need the support of another party. \u201cAnd if Scotland votes for the SNP in a hung parliament giving Scotland enormous leverage, then I will exercise that firstly in line with Scotland\u2019s interest. \u201cLabour perhaps are not fully understanding what they would need to do in order to get their policies fully implemented. \u201cI\u2019m not asking Labour to support Scottish independence, I\u2019m not even asking them to support the idea that there should be another independence referendum. \u201cI\u2019m making the reasonable request that they respect the principle, which is that if there\u2019s a referendum, and the timing of the referendum, should not be matters for Westminster to determine. They should be matters for the Scottish people in parliament to determine.\u201d Q: Why have antisemites stayed in the Labour party? The Jewish Labour Movement report on the problem is well out of date, McDonnell says. The individuals named in the report have been kicked out, he says. New procedures are dealing with the problem. Asked about the 136 cases cited in the report, McDonnell says it is \u201cwell below that\u201d now. He added: \u201cI came on this programme and I said I was angry because we weren\u2019t quick enough or ruthless enough. The new procedures are dealing with that.\u201d Q: Do you accept that if you lose this election antisemitism will be part of the reason? McDonnell says: I worry this has had its effect. We have done everything I think we can possible do. We have apologised to the Jewish community and I repeat that. We have always got to learn lessons. I want us to be a shining model. I apologise to the Jewish community for the suffering we have inflicted on them. I say to them we are doing everything possible. We are going to learn more lessons and we want to be the shining example of antiracism that the Labour party should be. Having gone through this horrible, horrible period, we come out of it now actually showing respect to the Jewish community and tackling this issue, and enabling the Labour party to tackle antisemitism in our wider society. Challenged on Labour\u2019s plans for hospital funding, McDonnell insists Labour would give the NHS the 4% extra it needs. Labour spending plans will be paid by the richest 5%, McDonnell says. He admits the rest will face a bill of more \u00a3200 a year but they will benefit from improved public services. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is being interviewed on BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. Q: Do you want to overthrow capitalism? I want to transform our economy and meet the existential threat of climate change, McDonnell says. Q: How are you going to pay for the pledge to Waspi women? McDonnell says it will come from borrowing, which is why it was not costed in the party\u2019s manifesto grey book. This is a historic mess that we have to address, he says. Scotland would vote in favour of independence if Brexit goes ahead, a poll suggests, but a majority would vote no to leaving the UK if it remains within the EU. The Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times found a majority, 51%, would back independence if the UK leaves the EU, while 49% would vote against it. However, if the UK remains in the EU, a majority said they are against Scottish independence at 58%, with 42% in favour. In general, support for independence has fallen, down 2% since November to 47%, while support for Scotland saying in the UK has risen by the same amount, to 53%. The poll results were published as the Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, urged Scots to vote Tory to put plans for a second independence referendum \u201cin cold storage for good\u201d. He urged unionist Scots to band together to stop a second independence referendum. But the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, said Scottish voters should \u201caim higher\u201d than Boris Johnson and Brexit when voting in the general election on Thursday. Nicola Sturgeon said the \u201cvery future\u201d of Scotland was at stake in the election. She said: \u201cScotland cannot afford to live under more Westminster chaos for years and potentially decades \u2013 and we certainly cannot afford five years of Boris Johnson. \u201cThe people of Scotland can do better than Boris and Brexit \u2013 and on Thursday we should aim higher. \u201cThis Thursday, people in Scotland have an opportunity to unite and demand the right to choose a better future as an independent country \u2013 where we always get the governments we vote for and where we have the powers we need to make Scotland the best it can be. \u201cSo I am asking Scotland to unite behind the SNP this Thursday \u2013 to escape Brexit, protect the NHS and to put Scotland\u2019s future in Scotland\u2019s hands \u2013 not Boris Johnson\u2019s.\u201d The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Boris Johnson is \u201cmisleading\u201d the British people by saying he will bring down immigration levels, PA Media reports. Speaking on Ridge on Sunday on Sky News, Ashworth said: \u201cWe should have a fair and balanced immigration system, of course we should, but he\u2019s (Boris Johnson) imposing a tax on nurses coming from the EU and beyond, to come and work for our NHS to care for our sick and elderly. He\u2019s going to exacerbate the staffing crisis in our NHS with his proposals. \u201cAnd he\u2019s also misleading the British people, because he\u2019s trying to give them the impression that he\u2019s going to be bringing immigration down, but when you look at the details of what he\u2019s announced today, he\u2019s saying he\u2019s going to hand over decisions on who will get a visa to an independent committee.\u201d \u201cThere will be no democratic control, there will be no accountability over any decision that any immigration minister makes, because it will be handed over to a statutory independent committee \u2013 so again, Boris Johnson\u2019s lying to the British people.\u201d Questioned on whether a Labour government would raise migration levels under any circumstances, Ashworth added: \u201cYou want an immigration system which reflects your needs in the economy.\u201d Asked whether if the economy needs it, Labour would permit a rise, he added: \u201cIf the economy needs it, then of course people should come here to work in our economy.\u201d Discussing Labour\u2019s social care policy, he said: \u201cEssentially we\u2019re announcing free personal social care\u201d. He added: \u201cIt means that no one will have to pay anything for the care that they get in their home, support getting out of bed \u2026 this is about ensuring fairness in the system.\u201d Pushed on the costings of the policy, Ashworth said: \u201cWell, we\u2019re putting \u00a310bn extra in.\u201d On whether Labour would agree to cross-party talks on social care legislation, Ashworth said if Labour loses the election, \u201cwe\u2019ll deal with it then\u201d, but that he\u2019s \u201calways prepared to talk to whoever\u201d. Here\u2019s PA Media\u2019s write-up on Johnson\u2019s claim that naughtiest thing he had ever done and was \u201cprepared to admit\u201d was riding his bicycle on the pavement. Much has been made of Johnson\u2019s past record, which has included being sacked as a Times journalist for making up a quote and lying to then-Tory leader Michael Howard about his affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt \u2013 another decision that led to him being sacked, this time from his role as a shadow minister. But when asked on Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme whether he had given his naughtiest deed any more thought, he exclaimed: \u201cOh no, not this again,\u201d before asking his aides to provide him with suggestions of the naughtiest thing they had witnessed him do. He then coughed up the confession of having cycled on the pavement in the past. The Conservative party leader said: \u201cI think I may sometimes, how can I put this, I may sometimes when I was riding a bicycle every day \u2013 which I used to do \u2013 I may sometimes have not always obeyed the law about cycling on the pavement. \u201cBut I want you to know how firmly and strongly I disapprove of people who cycle on the pavement and I think it\u2019s wrong and I feel bad about it but I might sometimes have scooted up onto the pavement rather than dismounting before.\u201d Asked if that was actually the naughtiest thing he had ever done, he replied: \u201cNo, no, it was a very careful rubric. What you said was the naughtiest thing that I was prepared to admit \u2026\u201d The same question brought one of the stand-out moments of the 2017 election campaign when Theresa May said her naughtiest moment was running through fields of wheat on local farms when she was growing up. Q: What happens to the Brexit party if the UK leaves EU in January? Farage says: It will have to reform into the Reform party. It\u2019ll have to campaign to change politics for good. Get rid of the House of Lords, change the voting system, so much to do. On Thursday, you\u2019ll see a turnout much lower than the pundits expect, because people have lost faith already. Q: Will your party be renamed the Reform party? Absolutely, I\u2019ve registered it already. Q: Why did three Brexit party MEPs defect to the Tories? Look at Annunziata Rees-Mogg\u2019s class, she is a Conservative. In Labour areas we will take Labour votes, Farage says. I have not fallen out with anyone. I am standing on principle. I have not moved, I want Brexit done, but I want the right Brexit done. We will be back in crisis if Johnson\u2019s deal goes through, Farage says. Q: Why is support for the Brexit party dropping? We have a chance of getting a \u201chandful\u201d of seats, Farage says. But he admits the party\u2019s support could be split. Now it\u2019s the turn of the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage. Q: What did you make of Boris Johnson\u2019s claims about immigration? Boris Johnson has always been very soft on immigration, but there is an election on so he is saying what people want to hear. How can people trust him, Farage says. Q: Has the Lib Dem campaign been too presidential? All Lib Dem campaigns have emphasised the leader. I\u2019m taking a clear position on Brexit, I recognise that some people don\u2019t like that. I want to stand up for what I believe in. That\u2019s politics. Q: Has criticism of you been sexist? Politics is sexist, Swinson says. One of the ways of challenging that is to vote for more women. Q: Was the decision to revoke article 50 a mistake? It is a policy that is popular among remain voters, even among Labour remainers, Swinson insists. Our position is that we want to remain in the EU. It would have democratic legitimacy if people voted for it in the election. Q: What\u2019s the point of voting Lib Dem? To have more Lib Dem MPs. Q: Would you resign if the Lib Dems get fewer MPs after the election? No. The party is in good health, she claims. I\u2019m absolutely here to stay. Four months is not long enough to turn round the party, she says. Q: What will your tactics be if there is a hung parliament? Neither Corbyn or Johnson are fit to be prime minister, Swinson says. She cites new allegations about antisemitism in the Labour party. We will continue to work with MPs who want to stop Brexit, she adds. Next up is Jo Swinson. Q: How is the campaign going? We still have an opportunity to stop Boris Johnson forcing the UK out of the EU without a deal, she says. Q: Why isn\u2019t Labour way ahead in the polls? Is Corbyn a problem? I hear people raising issues about Corbyn and Boris Johnson, Ashworth says. He claims a voter told him yesterday that Donald Trump wants to get his hands on the NHS market. Q: Should Corbyn resign if Labour loses? We are going to win, Ashworth claims. Ashworth promises a National Care Service for social care. He insists it will not mean writing a blank cheque to pay for it. The initiative will be paid for by the better off, Ashworth says. Q: Would you work with other parties on the future of social care? Ashworth ducks the questions by claiming he won\u2019t need to talk to other parties because Labour is going to win. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, is next up on Sky. Asked if he is happy for immigration to go up under Labour, Ashworth says \u201cif the economy needs it, of course people should be able to come here to work\u201d. He also claims Labour could deliver free social care for those that need it. The interview was recorded on Saturday, so PA Media had an embargoed write-up: Boris Johnson has refused to say whether he would resign if he fails to win a majority in Thursday\u2019s general election. The prime minister\u2019s high-stakes decision to call the snap vote could hand Jeremy Corbyn the keys to No 10 \u2013 making Johnson one of the shortest-serving PMs in British history. But, in an interview with Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Johnson would not be drawn on his political future when asked three times if he would stand down if he fails to secure a majority. The PM admitted he was nervous and \u201cfighting for every vote\u201d ahead of the poll, but when asked if he would resign if it did not go his way, he replied: \u201cThe choice on Thursday is unbelievably stark, it\u2019s between going forward with a one nation Conservative government that can get Brexit done \u2026 \u201c\u2026 or spending the whole of next year in complete paralysis with two referendums, one on Scotland, one on the EU when Jeremy Corbyn cannot even tell us what his position is on Brexit and who is going to campaign for the deal that he proposes to do.\u201d Pressed again, Johnson said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, Sophy, what I\u2019m going to do is concentrate on the five days before us because that is what I think the people of this country would expect. We have got a very short time to get our message across. It\u2019s a message of hope and optimism about this country.\u201d He restated his insistence that there would be no checks for goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Great Britain under his Brexit deal, saying the government documents shared by Labour were \u201cwrong\u201d. Corbyn said on Friday his party had obtained a confidential government report he claimed was proof that there would be customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit. But the PM told Sky: \u201cThere\u2019s no question of there being checks on goods going NI/GB or GB/NI because they are part of \u2013 if you look at what the deal is, we\u2019re part of the same customs territory and it\u2019s very clear that there should be unfettered access between Northern Ireland and the rest of GB.\u201d Johnson also said immigration to the UK would fall under his proposed system after Britain has left the EU. \u201cI can make sure that numbers will come down because we\u2019ll be able to control the system in that way and what I don\u2019t think is right is to have an uncontrolled and unlimited approach to that,\u201d he said. The PM confessed to having sometimes ridden a bicycle on the pavement when he was asked to reveal the naughtiest thing he has ever done. \u201cWhen I was riding a bicycle every day which I used to do, I may sometimes have not always obeyed the law about cycling on the pavement,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI may sometimes, OK \u2013 but I want you to know how firmly and strongly I disapprove of people who cycle on the pavement and I think it\u2019s wrong and I feel bad about it but I might sometimes have scooted up on to the pavement rather than dismounting before.\u201d Johnson claimed he had been asked to say what was the naughtiest thing he was prepared to admit, rather than the naughtiest thing he had ever done. And he pledged: \u201cI still strongly disapprove of anybody breaching the laws of the road and we\u2019ll invigilate them very thoroughly if we\u2019re lucky enough to be returned with a working majority on Thursday which is what we need to get Brexit done and move this country forward.\u201d Q: What\u2019s the naughtiest thing you have done? Not this again, Johnson says. I\u2019ve been so busy to try to get Brexit done, he claims. \u201cHelp me out folks?\u201d Johnson turns to his staff. I may sometimes when I was riding a bicycle may not have obeyed the law about cycling on the pavement, Johnson says. Q: Would you resign if you failed to get a majority? Johnson dodges the question. I\u2019m going to fight for every vote. I\u2019m going to concentrate on the five days before us. He added: \u201cWe have got a very short time to get our message acros. It\u2019s a message of hope and optimism about this country.\u201d Q: How many of the 50,000 nurses promised in the Tory manifesto will be new? Thirty-one thousand, Johnson admits. Challenged on the number of hospitals the party is promising, he again suggests that seed money will help delivery 40 new hospitals. Q: What is the most radical thing in the Tory manifesto? Brexit, Johnson says at first. Then he talks about infrastructure, homes, police and the prison system. The whole agenda is transformative of this country, Johnson says. He again claims that the programme is that of a one nation Conservative party. \u201cThis will bring the country together,\u201d Johnson says. Q: Will there be higher or lower immigration under the Australian points-based system? Lower, Johnson says. But he accepts that the Australian system has resulted in more immigration. He says he is not against immigration. It depends how the new system is applied. We want to bear down on immigration particularly on low skilled workers who have no job to come to, Johnson says. Q: Can you guarantee numbers will come down? Yes. Unlike Labour who will keep free movement. People are not hostile to immigration in the UK but they do want to see it democratically controlled. Q: Will there be checks on the Irish border? No, says Johnson. There won\u2019t be checks both sides of the border, Johnson says, despite the leak of a document suggesting there will be. We are a UK government, why would we put on checks from GB to NI or NI to GB, Johnson says. Ridge asks Johnson why people should trust him. He talks about his record as London mayor and insists he is someone who delivers. \u201cWe want to get on and deliver,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t take long to change the subject to Brexit and getting it done. Welcome to our final Sunday edition of politics live before Thursday\u2019s general election. Boris Johnson is still refusing to do an interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil, but he has agreed to face Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge this morning. She will also interview the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, and the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage. There\u2019ll be no last-minute appeals from Jeremy Corbyn on either Sky or the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. Marr will be speaking to the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, and the polling guru John Curtice. There is also no sign that the polls are shifting. The Tories still enjoy a lead of about 10%.",

Is Anton destined for his second ever Grand Final, or his first if you\u2019ve chosen to erase Katie Derham from Strictly history? Will Karim get anything other than a ten? Is Kelvin about to get his chest out? Can Chris manage two dances? I\u2019d say yes/no/yes/no, but feel free to disagree down below.</p> <p>Heidi\u2019s Hunches say that it HAS to be a Karim/Kelvin/Emma final, but tonight\u2019s two-dance marathon could send all remaining sense and reason out of the window, judging-wise. I\u2019ll be up here from 7pm to keep a beady eye on all things dance, and would be delighted if you could sprinkle a little magic and sparkle in the comment box below.

All that remains is for us to gather our loved ones round the television for next Saturday\u2019s Grand Final, when we\u2019ll find out whether Kelvin, Karim or Emma will lift this year\u2019s Strictly glitterball. In these times of political madness, we all need shiny things to look forward to. Thank you all for joining in this weekend \u2013 feel free to swing by Twitter @heidistephens and tell me who you think is going to win, or use the convenient comment box provided below. Also PLEASE VOTE ON THURSDAY. See you at 7.05pm next week! They take to the floor for their final dance, to \u2018That\u2019s What Friends Are For\u2019 by Dionne Warwick. There\u2019s a bit of country dancing, but sadly no conga. Ah well. Chris says lovely things about Karen, and their montage shows how far Chris has come since Week One. Karen reciprocates, it\u2019s clear these two have become great mates. Judging time! As expected they all save Karim and Amy, which means CHRIS AND KAREN are leaving Strictly. Big hugs all round. Very happy to watch Karim\u2019s American Smooth again \u2013 I wasn\u2019t hugely inspired last night but keen to give it another spin. He looks happier and more relaxed this time round, and his footwork is impeccable. Assuming he doesn\u2019t pile into the Lib Dem bus, we\u2019ll be seeing these two next week. Dance off time! Chris and Karen are up first, dancing their non-Rumba. Her dress is stunning, 100% would wear to Morrisons. Daughter and I are discussing what brand of sports bra Oti wears, just to fill the time. Time for another montage \u2013 get used to the filler, next week has more than Craig\u2019s forehead. Aside from this being a conclusion so foregone it\u2019s already put its coat and shoes on, it\u2019s interesting that the public have saved Emma and Anton from the dance-off \u2013 that has to make them contenders for the glitterball next week, surely? That said, they\u2019re going to need a pretty special Showdance to beat Kelvin and Karim, who I suspect will both deliver absolute showstoppers. Who is joining Karim and Amy in tonight\u2019s final dance-off? So much tension, but glad we no longer have to do this fifteen times. CHRIS AND KAREN are in the dance-off, which means Emma and Anton are safe. Taxi for Chris. Motsi looks like one of the Snowths from the muppets. Mahna Mahna doo doo do do do. Ooh, love a judges\u2019 montage. Anton\u2019s teeth is my favourite moment of the series. Niall is singing his new singing, Nice To Meet You, accompanied by Katya and Gorka doing some quite hot dancing. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Niall Horan. You may remember him from being the one nobody remembers from One Direction, although he\u2019s actually my favourite and arguably the most talented, don\u2019t @ me. So who is definitely through to next week\u2019s Grand Final? Kelvin and Oti are through, which is no surprise at all. First couple in the bottom two \u2013 KARIM AND AMY. Well they\u2019re safe \u2013 the judges will never save Emma or Chris over Karim. Last night on Strictly: a HUGE semi. Loved Kelvin\u2019s performances, and totally admired the ambition of Karim\u2019s \u2013 at this stage he\u2019s the one pushing the dance boundaries when it would be easy for him to phone it in and coast to the final. I loved Emma and Anton\u2019s interpretive Waltz, less so their Cha Cha. Chris gets all the points for bringing personality and journey to this year\u2019s show, but he clearly struggled with the demands of two dances. Motsi was high on something, dishing out tens like canapes at a cocktail party. Good LORD, what IS Motsi wearing? It\u2019s so\u2026PINK. And appears to feature a shower cap, which is niche. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess being strangled by a giant tuna, Claudia in a rather lovely black halterneck. So the general gist of this is that Carlos has taken a fancy to a very frilly Katya, which he demonstrates by flinging her around a bit. Marvellous. Tonight\u2019s opening pro dance features Cuban ballet superstar Carlos Acosta. Earlier in the year he was rumoured to be Darcey\u2019s replacement, but instead we were blessed with the force of nature that is Motsi Mabuse, and Carlos dancing tonight instead. Am very happy with this arrangement. And we\u2019re off! These credits are still making me sad, we should still have Dev and Michelle but they are sadly no longer with us. Caught up with the final Countryside Casual Weather of the year earlier, presented by weathery charmster Darren Bett in a muted pink shirt. Bonus points for the rolled-up sleeves, but those same points deducted for an overly-demure neckline. Would it have been too much to celebrate the festive season with Tomasz Schafernaker fresh from the gym? Evening all, and welcome back to this week\u2019s Strictly results show! We\u2019ve reached the business end of the competition now, when we need to let the last couple go before next week\u2019s Grand Final. Common sense says this will be Chris and Karen, but we all know how much the Strictly viewer loves an underdog, and Craig\u2019s four last night may have been enough to bring out the vote. I\u2019m liveblogging this evening from an extremely low cost hotel in Plymouth, where the daughter is having her tonsils out in the morning (in Plymouth, not in a low cost hotel). On the upside this means I have said daughter with me for the first time this series, and she\u2019ll be home for the Grand Final next weekend. On the downside I\u2019m dependent on unknown WiFi, so talk amongst yourselves if I briefly disappear. Kick off is at 7.20pm \u2013 see you then! So that\u2019s it for tonight\u2019s semi-final dancing! Thank you for joining in - I\u2019ll be back tomorrow night at 7.20pm to find out which three couples are going through to next week\u2019s GRAND FINAL. My money\u2019s on Chris and Karen leaving tomorrow, unless by some public voting insanity they can stay out of the bottom two. Enjoy the rest of your Saturday, and I\u2019ll see you then! After two dances the leaderboard hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 Kelvin and Karim hogging the top half, Emma and Chris at the bottom. The voting is open! Time for a recap \u2013 my faves dances were definitely both of Kelvin and Oti\u2019s, but as a TWO DANCES week goes, that was actually pretty decent. Scores: 9,10,9,10 \u2013 a total of 38 for Karim and Amy. At this point tens have been rendered entirely meanlingless. Amy is crying. DRINK. Also journey. DRINK. Motsi thought it was technically excellent, and Shirley agrees although the lift wasn\u2019t very good. Bruno thought it was perfectly pitched storytelling, but Craig agrees about the lift - however the dance itself was absolutely incredible. Clearly I need to watch that again. Ooh, a carboard bus! Well this should be entirely charming, but would be nice if Karim didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d just come from ballet class and wasn\u2019t really in the mood for a Smooth. Technically good, but for a song like this it could be SO much more fun. Bit disappointed. And finally for tonight it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! Their second dance is the American Smooth to \u2018Sweet Caroline\u2019 by Neil Diamond. This reminds me of a rowdy singalong at my sister\u2019s wedding last year that started before we\u2019d even sat down for dinner. BA BA BAAAAH. Incidentally, Abbey and Aljaz also danced the American Smooth to this song in the 2013 semi-final, and then went on to win the competition. QUICK BUY YOUR TICKETS FOR THE LIVE TOUR. Chris has worked very hard \u2013 DRINK. Scores: 4,8,8,8 \u2013 a total of 28 for Chris and Karen. He\u2019s going to be bottom of the leader board either way, so it doesn\u2019t really matter. Craig thought that was wrong dance, wrong day. Motsi liked the sensitivity but a bit more Rumba would have been nice. Shirley thought one step was executed very well, but it lacked body action. Bruno thought Chris gave great depth of feeling, even though it was technically lacking. Chris had made it clear that this is not a sexy Rumba, which kind of defeats the purpose of a Rumba. He gets round this by not really dancing a Rumba at all \u2013 there\u2019s no real hip action but he does tell a nice story that involves wandering off at the end. Good lord, Kelvin giving it full Spanish line in a mesh top is quite something. This has all the drama and intent we love in a Paso, whilst also being incredibly masculine and beautifully delivered despite the wobbly ending. My favourite Paso in AGES. It\u2019s time for CHRIS AND KAREN! Their second dance is a Rumba to \u2018Don\u2019t Watch Me Cry\u2019 by Jorja Smith. It\u2019s reasonable to assume this will literally be a \u2018semi rumba\u2019, because a) it\u2019s Chris and b) he\u2019s only had half a week. Of course he could absolutely smash this and surprise us all, I am prepared to entertain this possibility. Scores: 9,10,9,9 \u2013 a total of 37 for Kelvin and Oti. Motsi doesn\u2019t give a HOOT this evening. Bruno thought Kelvin looked like the ultimate Paso action hero \u2013 parts of it had a sculptural beauty but there were a couple of moments where Kelvin could have stretched it even further. Craig thought it was slightly measured and needed more extension, and Kelvin was out of time at the beginning, but otherwise impressive. Motsi loved how Kelvin kept the line tight, and Kelvin has Motsi\u2019s respect. Shirley agrees there were some impressive moments but there were some bits off balance \u2013 all in all a great job. Next up it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! Their second dance is the Paso Doble to \u2018Seven Nation Army\u2019 by The White Stripes. I have extremely high hopes for this having all the drive, attitude and menace we look for in a Paso, plus bonus Oti. Anton is crying. DRINK. Journey \u2013 DRINK! Scores: 8,9,9,10 \u2013 a total of 36 for Emma and Anton. Sure. Shirley loved how Emma and Anton danced at the end of the beat, and Emma had some lovely footwork despite a few tiny stumbles. Bruno thought it had natural elegance and a hypnotic beauty, and they managed the changing tempo the music beautifully. Craig thought Emma missed her frame on occasion and also a LOT of heel leads. Motsi thought it was the purest form of dancing. This feels like an odd piece of music for a Waltz, but they\u2019re doing a lovely job of it. Emma looks so much happier in ballroom, I like the understated elegance of this. Time for another round of dancing! First up it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON. Their second dance is the Waltz to \u2018Gymnop\u00e9die No.1\u2019 by Erik Satie. How do you get to Week 12 having not done a Cha Cha Cha or a Waltz? They used to be the ones couples did first, feels weird wheeling out one of the basics in Week 12 when we should be getting a look at your Argentine Tango by now. Half way leader board \u2013 Kelcin and Oti at the top, Chris and Karen at the bottom. All as expected, interested to see what the second half brings. Scores: 8,10,9,9 \u2013 a total of 36 for Karim and Amy. Oh Motsi, really? Motsi thought it was intense and had 110% intimacy. Shirley thought it was one of the most difficult Argentine routines she\u2019s seen, but Karim\u2019s foot was wobbly in places. Bruno thought it was manly and moody, and the structure and content was difficult. It didn\u2019t have Karim\u2019s usual slick balance, but the last section of ganchos was splendid. Craig agrees there were balance issues, but there was a lot right with it too \u2013 a bit too aggressive for him and not enough Argentine Tango flavour. I never really know what I\u2019m looking for in a great Argentine, but Karim is doing a lovely job of hauling Amy round the dancefloor in an incredibly inefficient manner. He doesn\u2019t look entirely stable at times but some nice flicky legs. It\u2019s a passion-free zone, as expected. Also, those trousers. Lovely to see Vincent Simone doing this choreography for this dance. I miss Vincent and Flavia. And finally for this first round it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! Their first dance is the Argentine Tango to \u2018Libertango\u2019 by Bond. It feels a shame we\u2019ll only see two Argentines this series, and I have a feeling we might file this one under \u2018technically excellent but lacks passion\u2019. Incidentally, it would be very much in Strictly\u2019s interests if Karim and Amy won the glitterball this season \u2013 they\u2019re the only couple left who will dance with each other on the Strictly live tour. Emma is dancing with Graziano, Kelvin with Janette, and Chris isn\u2019t touring at all. Scores: 7,7,6,6 \u2013 a total of 26 for Chris and Karen. Craig thought it could have been a bit smoother and it went wrong, but he\u2019s proud of Chris for how far he\u2019s come. Motsi loves how Chris\u2019s eyes sparkle when he dances, and he did a great job. Shirley thought there were too many mistakes but she admires Chris for carrying on. Bruno appreciated Chris\u2019s hard work and his ballroom has improved, but tonight his footwork went off the rails. Chris looks very dapper in black velvet and braiding, and this is absolutely not the worst Viennese Waltz we\u2019ve ever seen. But it\u2019s not great either \u2013 his footwork goes a bit awry in place and the timing is a bit shaky. That said, he\u2019s this year\u2019s biggest improver and looks like he\u2019s having a lovely time. Anyone else still thinking about Kelvin\u2019s woodpecker? It\u2019s time for CHRIS AND KAREN! Their first dance is the Viennese Waltz to \u2018Somebody To Love\u2019 by Queen. I love the Viennese and I love this song \u2013 it\u2019s an old Strictly fave, this is the fourth time it\u2019s been wheeled out over the years. Intrigued that Chris is saving the Rumba for his second dance \u2013 either this Viennese is particularly bad, or his Rumba is incredible. Or maybe so bad it\u2019s at least memorable? Scores: 10,10,10,10 \u2013 DRINK DRINK DRINK. Kelvin is crying. DRINK MORE. Bruno thought that was a sparkling delight \u2013 it had light footwork, precision and incredible musicality. Craig was quite upset because he couldn\u2019t find much wrong with it. Motsi was wowed too, Kelvin could have played it safe but it it was a complex routine. Shirley loved the pendulum swings and Kelvin\u2019s woodpecker was amazing. Bruno has lost it. Lovely to the see the return of the Strictly caf\u00e9 table, and Oti\u2019s floral dress is glorious. Kelvin is making light work of this Quickstep \u2013 he\u2019s absolutely the most versatile dancer on this year\u2019s show. Lovely light footwork and incredible timing \u2013 enjoyed that very much. Next up it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! Their first dance is the Quickstep to \u2018The Lady is a Tramp\u2019 by Glee Cast. Sophie and Brendan did a lovely Quickstep to this years back, I\u2019m very much here for the Kelvin/Oti revival. Scores: 7,8,8,8 \u2013 a total of 31 for Emma and Anton. Shirley thought that was a massive improvement on Emma\u2019s first Latin dance, but it needed better leg action. Bruno thought it was a very strong performance, and Emma sold it like the ultimate showgirl. Craig thought it lacked hip action and Emma lost her balance, although Anton thought that might be him because he got over-excited. Motsi thought it was amazing considering the pressure Emma is under. Love Emma\u2019s gold tinsel frock, but this Cha Cha needs warming up through the hips, or at least a couple of sambucas beforehand. All a bit stiff and clunky from where I\u2019m sitting, but Emma is definitely selling it. It\u2019s \u2018message of support\u2019 VT week \u2013 a mix of people off \u2018Enders and some random fans with cute kids. First up tonight it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON! Their opening spin around the dancefloor is a Cha Cha Cha to \u2018Hold My Hand\u2019 by Jess Glynne. Anton\u2019s campaign of uptempo Latin avoidance has hit a dead end, it was either this or the Samba, and I for one am grateful \u2013 the memories of Anton\u2019s Samba turns with both Susannah Constantine and Ruth Langsford are still etched into my eyeballs. Out come the stars! No bare chests for this round, but Karim has horrible trousers and a serious eyeliner game. Out come the judges! Motsi\u2019s gone full camo netting. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a black bandage with only one shoulder, Claudia in a black tux and a killer fringe. I rather like both. And we\u2019re off! It\u2019s the Strictly semi final, and a place in the final is at stake. Yes, we understand how the process works, thanks. Kelvin will do ANYTHING to get into the final. Suggest somebody puts Bingo Nanna in a safe house. This week\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo \u2013 a swing of something you were definitely keeping for Christmas for any occurrence of the following: Four tens Contestants being exhausted Any mention of journey Last ditch family members Crying For the most part I\u2019m sad that Strictly is ending next week, but on the upside it means we\u2019ll never have to watch this terrible pop quiz again. Although the BBC website tells me this is series 2 - how on earth did this get a second series? Alan Partridge would be livid. Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing liveblog! It\u2019s semi final time at last - this time next week we\u2019ll be readying ourselves for a final spin around the Strictly dancefloor, followed by ten days of Christmas panic. Where once our lives were dusted with glitter, we\u2019ll soon be festooned with sprouts and pigs in blankets. Tonight\u2019s show is a serious business, and there are questions to be answered. Is Anton destined for his second ever Grand Final, or his first if you\u2019ve chosen to erase Katie Derham from Strictly history? Will Karim get anything other than a ten? Is Kelvin about to get his chest out? Can Chris manage two dances? I\u2019d say yes/no/yes/no, but feel free to disagree down below. Heidi\u2019s Hunches say that it HAS to be a Karim/Kelvin/Emma final, but tonight\u2019s two-dance marathon could send all remaining sense and reason out of the window, judging-wise. I\u2019ll be up here from 7pm to keep a beady eye on all things dance, and would be delighted if you could sprinkle a little magic and sparkle in the comment box below. There are only two weeks left, so find that bonus bag of glitter down the back of the sofa. See you in a bit!",

Of most concern, the figures, obtained by the Redfern Legal Centre under freedom of information laws, show that one 11-year old, one 12-year-old and four 13-year-old boys have been strip-searched since 2016.</p> <p><strong>Facebook is telling users that Islamophobic posts distributed through a network of far-right pages meet its \u201ccommunity standards\u201d</strong>, despite revelations they are being used as part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/09/facebook-tells-users-islamophobic-posts-meet-its-community-standards-despite-investigation\">coordinated scheme profiting from hate and disinformation</a>.

The pages were used to coordinate the distribution of more than a thousand \u201cnews\u201d posts each week to more than 1 million followers, spreading disinformation and hate targeting Muslims, promoting far-right politicians and vilifying prominent Muslim politicians.</p> <p><strong>Hundreds of thousands of protesters have filled the streets of Hong Kong</strong> in a mass show of support for the anti-government movement entering its seventh month.<strong> </strong>The march was mostly peaceful, in a rare break from escalating violent scenes. It was the first time in nearly four months that the march organiser, Civil Human Rights Front, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/08/hong-kong-democracy-protests-continue-into-seventh-month\">had been given police permission</a> for a mass demonstration. The organiser of million-strong marches in June estimated that 800,000 people took part.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 9 December. Top stories More than 300 school-age boys have been strip-searched by the NSW police in the past three years. As police and the state government come under increasing pressure to reform the use of strip-searching amid evidence of its widespread misuse, Guardian Australia can reveal that since 2016 police have forced 344 boys between the ages of 11 and 17 to submit to the controversial practice. Of most concern, the figures, obtained by the Redfern Legal Centre under freedom of information laws, show that one 11-year old, one 12-year-old and four 13-year-old boys have been strip-searched since 2016. Facebook is telling users that Islamophobic posts distributed through a network of far-right pages meet its \u201ccommunity standards\u201d, despite revelations they are being used as part of a coordinated scheme profiting from hate and disinformation. Guardian Australia revealed on Friday that an Israel-based group had gained access to at least 21 far-right Facebook pages with vast followings across the western world. The pages were used to coordinate the distribution of more than a thousand \u201cnews\u201d posts each week to more than 1 million followers, spreading disinformation and hate targeting Muslims, promoting far-right politicians and vilifying prominent Muslim politicians. Hundreds of thousands of protesters have filled the streets of Hong Kong in a mass show of support for the anti-government movement entering its seventh month. The march was mostly peaceful, in a rare break from escalating violent scenes. It was the first time in nearly four months that the march organiser, Civil Human Rights Front, had been given police permission for a mass demonstration. The organiser of million-strong marches in June estimated that 800,000 people took part. Police said 183,000 had turned up. Australia Australia is at risk of becoming a dumping ground for cars pre-charged with a greenhouse gas 1,400 times more potent than carbon dioxide, industry groups warn. The culprit is refrigerant used in car air-conditioning systems known as HFC-134a, a gas introduced to replace ozone-depleting gases that were phased out in the 90s, but which has since been banned in the US and EU. Firefighters have taken advantage of less extreme conditions to try to contain blazes burning across NSW ahead of worsening conditions and soaring temperatures expected on Tuesday. Senior ministers have continued to downplay suggestions the government could accept the New Zealand offer to resettle refugees in offshore detention, amid ongoing speculation about the terms of an arrangement made with the Senate crossbencher Jacqui Lambie. The proportion of voters nominating global warming and the environment as their top issue is at an all-time high, and helped Labor win votes at the May 2019 election despite its shock loss, according to the Australian National University\u2019s election survey, released on Monday. The world Urgent UN talks on tackling the climate emergency are still not addressing the true scale of the crisis, one of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists has warned, as high-ranking ministers from governments around the world began to arrive in Madrid for the final days of negotiations. The Democratic chairman of the House judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, may include evidence from the Mueller report in articles of impeachment against Donald Trump. The impeachment articles could be published as early as next week. Meanwhile the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, faces a major test at a high-stakes summit with Vladimir Putin in Paris. The UK\u2019s shadow chancellor has expressed his concern that the row over antisemitism in Labour may have an effect on the British election result, adding that the party had \u201cdone everything we can possibly do\u201d to tackle the problem. A fire has swept through a market in Delhi, killing at least 43 people and prompting an outpouring of grief and anger. Carroll Spinney, who played Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch on Sesame Street for nearly 50 years, has died. He was 85. He voiced and operated Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch until he was into his 80s. Recommended reads Tasmania\u2019s Overland Track offers sun, snow and glory in a wild and wondrous place, writes Nikki Marshall. \u201cThe trail from Cradle Valley to Lake St Clair takes hikers across alpine plateaus, where wildflowers peep out below snowdrifts, through moors dotted with buttongrass and grazing wombats, and into majestic myrtle beech rainforests. It\u2019s bucket-list beautiful.\u201d Few actors could be said to have dominated a year as much as Adam Driver. \u201cThe 36-year-old began 2019 with a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for BlacKkKlansman and will end it as the star of three of the year\u2019s most talked-about movies \u2013 The Report, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Marriage Story,\u201d writes Sarah Hughes. \u201cHis pecs appeal is regularly debated online while a writer on US website the Cut became \u2018so flustered by his quads [in Burn This] that \u2026 I spilled all of the contents of my purse on the floor\u2019. No wonder then that he is increasingly hailed as Hollywood\u2019s latest, if most unlikely, heartthrob.\u201d Listen Did you know that there were state-sanctioned massacres of Indigenous people as recently as 1928? These stories, and many more, have been hidden and denied for generations but that\u2019s beginning to change. In this episode of the Full Story podcast we unpack how these massacres took place around the country and explore how one community is continuing to grapple with this violence. Sport Brisbane Heat have claimed back-to-back WBBL titles, defeating Adelaide Strikers by six wickets in Sunday\u2019s final at a sold-out Allan Border Field. Matt Jones held his nerve to claim his second Australian Open. Jones proved a worthy recipient of the Stonehaven Cup at an Australian Open overshadowed by Sydney\u2019s bushfires, writes Matt Cleary. It is a good thing for J\u00fcrgen Klopp that Liverpool keep winning, because so do their most impressive rivals, writes Paul Doyle, as Leicester City beat Aston Villa 4-1, sweeping to their eighth league victory in a row \u2013 their best streak in the top flight. Media roundup Anthony Albanese has come out in support of Australian coal exports in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age.

But responses to freedom of information requests, published by the Sunday Times, showed the contract will also allow the company access to information on symptoms, causes and definitions of conditions, and \u201call related copyrightable content and data and other materials\u201d. Amazon, which is worth $863bn and is run by the world\u2019s richest person, Jeff Bezos, can then create \u201cnew products, applications, cloud-based services and/or distributed software\u201d, which the NHS would not benefit from financially. It can also share the information with third parties. Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, told the Sunday Times that the government was \u201chighly irresponsible\u201d and \u201cin the pocket of big corporate interests\u201d. Eva Blum-Dumontet, a senior researcher at Privacy International, which obtained the contract, said the issue with the partnership was not about \u201cdata sharing\u201d but about \u201ctransparency\u201d. Several sections have been redacted by the Department of Health and Social Care to protect Amazon\u2019s commercial interests. An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cNo patient data is being provided to this company by the NHS, which takes data privacy extremely seriously and has put appropriate safeguards in place to ensure information is used correctly.\u201d Amazon told the Sunday Times the content it had access to was already on the NHS website. \u201cAmazon does not build customer health profiles based on interactions with nhs.uk content or use such requests for marketing purposes,\u201d it added. Third parties, such as local authorities, can reuse information from the NHS website, but standard agreements only permit this to be used in the UK. The contract with Amazon states that the licence applies around the world. A spokesperson for the company said: \u201cGeneral health-related content from the NHS website is now available to Alexa users via voice technology. The new option is particularly useful for those with accessibility needs who may not have been able to easily access nhs.uk content via a mobile device or computer in the past.\u201d Earlier this week, the company was singled out by tax transparency campaign group Fair Tax Mark as the worst of the big six US tech firms for avoiding tax by shifting revenue and profits through tax havens or low-tax countries. It said Amazon paid just $3.4bn (\u00a32.6bn) in tax on its global income so far this decade, despite gaining revenues of $960.5bn and profits of $26.8bn.",

      "bodyText": "Australia is at risk of becoming a dumping ground for cars pre-charged with a greenhouse gas 1,400 times more potent than carbon dioxide, industry groups warn. The culprit is refrigerant used in car air-conditioning systems known as HFC-134a, a gas first introduced to replace ozone-depleting gases that were phased out in the 90s. Since then, HFC-134a has been found to be a potent greenhouse gas, a discovery which has seen it banned in the EU and the US thanks the widespread availability of an alternative gas, HFO-1234yf. HFO-1234yf has no impact on the environment as a greenhouse gas, but is slightly more flammable under very specific circumstances. Though Australia was an early and enthusiastic adopter of international obligations such as the Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases, it has yet to extend these regulations to include a ban on HFC-134a and similar gases with a high global warming potential. Instead the Australian government has maintained the status quo, relying on existing regulations under the Montreal Protocol to phase out the old stock of gas by the middle of next decade and the assumption that importing into the country new cars with the latest technology will naturally reduce use of the gas. As has been the case with CO2 emissions more broadly, this has not been borne out. A report released in September by the Department of the Environment said it would take until 2020 for HFC-134a to be phased out under existing arrangements, but also noted the expected transition to the cleaner gas has so far \u201cnot occurred\u201d. The report especially noted that carmakers were using Australia as a dumping ground due to its lack of regulation. \u201cAutomakers appear content to continue to supply models with older generations of refrigerants to any markets that permit HFCs, while making HFO-charged models available where they are required to by law,\u201d the report said. Last year Australia imported roughly 1.2m new cars, which added an additional 677 tonnes of HFC-134a to the country\u2019s stocks, while another 707 tonnes was used to refill empty air-conditioning systems. These included cars such as the German-made Holden Commodore, and even electric vehicles from Tesla. Both companies were contacted for comment but did not respond by deadline. Last year, air-conditioning systems used in Australian cars released 1.34 megatonnes of CO2-equivalent last year into the atmosphere as they experienced general wear, road accidents or came to the end of their life. For a country that has seen CO2 emissions rise from its road transport fleet in recent years, banning the importation of cars charged with HFC-134a would be a quick \u2013 and cheap \u2013 way of dealing with the issue, but the environment minister, Sussan Ley, has so far remained non-committal on the issue. A ministerial spokesperson said use of HFC-134a is accounted for in the country of origin and, while the government is closely monitoring existing regulations to phase out HFC use over time, it will \u201cconsider other measures in industry sectors should the phase-down not proceed at the pace expected\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThe Department of Environment and Energy will be meeting with motor vehicle manufacturers in the coming months to discuss their plans to move to low global warming potential refrigerants,\u201d the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said the government intends to address the issue of HFC-134a use within electric vehicles as part of the electric vehicle strategy it is currently developing. While industry groups have welcomed the news, Ian Stangroome, president of the automotive air-conditioning technicians network Vasa, said Australia could do more to proactively expand its existing regulation to ban cars with HFC-134a. To do so would be a \u201cfree kick\u201d for the government. These comments were echoed by the executive director of Refrigerants Australia, Greg Picker, who said the government needs to take \u201cone more step\u201d. \u201cIn automobile air-conditioning, the [current] strategy has not delivered,\u201d Picker said. \u201cWe would like to see a limit \u2013 I see no reason to do anything different than the EU \u2013 of a global warming potential limit of 150 placed on car imports in the future.\u201d \u201cExisting legislation gives the Australian government capacity to put a limit in place.

Farage waited in the wings expressionless before exploding into life, striding down the gangway to his soundtrack of the party\u2019s 2019 campaign, Power by Kanye West.</p> \n<p>He vigorously shook the hands of those followers who paid \u00a32.50 to attend. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be on stage in leave country,\u201d he declared.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in the heart of a part of England that feels very, very let down by parliament, [the] political class.

Worse, it is not a seat the party is contesting. Running events a few miles into the wrong constituency is one of many hallmarks of a campaign that is now on life support.</p> \n<p>In Labour heartlands, where the campaign came to land, the Brexit party wheels out Farage\u2019s greatest hits \u2013 the undemocratic EU, the establishment not listening to leave voters, not delivering Brexit, communities ignored by the London-centric left, which has taken votes for granted.</p> \n<p>Pints are pulled and sunk in local pubs.

Yet one woman, who hung on his every word throughout, admits afterwards that she will vote Tory as that is the only option in her Conservative-held Lincolnshire constituency.</p> \n<p>If the polls are even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/dec/08/election-polls-uk-2019-latest-opinion-poll-tracker-tories-labour\">close to reality</a>, the Brexit party\u2019s campaign, having never risen above 12%, is flatlining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/23/tories-renewed-poll-boost-brexit-party-candidates-pull-out-opinium-observer\">on about 3%</a>. Mercilessly snubbed by the Tories, who appear to prefer losing seats to working with him, Farage\u2019s campaign has struggled to recover from his devastating speech in Hartlepool on 11 November, when he announced he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/brexit-party-will-not-contest-317-tory-seats-nigel-farage-says\">pulling candidates out</a> of 317 Tory-held seats, to the stunned silence, then nervous applause, of supporters.</p> \n<p>There, he told members he was putting country before party and deciding not to split the leave vote. Farage was pegging this dramatic change in direction rather flimsily on a video he had seen on Twitter by Boris Johnson, in which he promised he would not accept an extension of the transition period for Britain leaving the EU beyond the end of 2020.</p> \n<p>He also said he wanted to negotiate a \u201csuper Canada-plus\u201d trade deal with no political alignment. This was the kind of Brexit Farage could support, although it was not the exact \u201cclean Brexit\u201d he had championed months before in the European election campaign.</p> \n<p>The Tories did not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/nigel-farage-urged-to-stand-aside-in-tory-target-seats-after-brexit-party-climbdown\">return the favour</a>, with no candidates stood down and no formal alliance \u2013 leaving Farage appearing weak and without influence.

Paul Thompson, 52, from Craig-y-don in Tory-held Aberconwy, said he was \u201cgutted\u201d not to be able to vote for the party in the election.</p> \n<p>He said that from early canvassing in Clwyd West, also held by the Conservatives, there was a positive reaction towards the party.</p> \n<p>Sensational stories about the party\u2019s senior figures being offered peerages and positions, including claims that Ann Widdecombe was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/nigel-farage-says-he-is-unlikely-to-vote-for-any-party-in-election\">offered a place</a> in a future Brexit negotiating team by those around Boris Johnson, were brushed off by the Tories.</p> \n<p>In Peterborough, a mix-up over Farage\u2019s route through the city during his one of his walkabouts meant a first glimpse of the election campaign bus was missed by the assembled press pack.

      "bodyText": "At Hull Ionians RUFC on a soaking wet Thursday morning last month, chairs were swiftly removed from the back few rows of a Brexit party event. It did the trick. The curtained event space, usually reserved for weddings, suddenly went from looking half empty to almost full. After the highs of the EU election campaign, when Nigel Farage\u2019s party drew thousands to glitzy rallies, a swathe of empty chairs beneath a glitter ball might not be how he imagined his eighth general election campaign would pan out. Still, the show goes on. Farage waited in the wings expressionless before exploding into life, striding down the gangway to his soundtrack of the party\u2019s 2019 campaign, Power by Kanye West. He vigorously shook the hands of those followers who paid \u00a32.50 to attend. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be on stage in leave country,\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019m in the heart of a part of England that feels very, very let down by parliament, [the] political class. It\u2019s three-and-a-half years on and we\u2019ve still not got Brexit.\u201d Except he is in Haltemprice and Howden, the seat of the arch-Eurosceptic David Davis, a former Brexit secretary. Worse, it is not a seat the party is contesting. Running events a few miles into the wrong constituency is one of many hallmarks of a campaign that is now on life support. In Labour heartlands, where the campaign came to land, the Brexit party wheels out Farage\u2019s greatest hits \u2013 the undemocratic EU, the establishment not listening to leave voters, not delivering Brexit, communities ignored by the London-centric left, which has taken votes for granted. Pints are pulled and sunk in local pubs. At campaign events, Farage gets belly laughs and engages his supporters in very lively back and forths. His jokes feel hackneyed but they land with aplomb. In Grimsby, he is asked the first thing he would do if and when elected prime minister. \u201cGo for a pint,\u201d he replies, and the audience goes wild. Yet one woman, who hung on his every word throughout, admits afterwards that she will vote Tory as that is the only option in her Conservative-held Lincolnshire constituency. If the polls are even close to reality, the Brexit party\u2019s campaign, having never risen above 12%, is flatlining on about 3%. Mercilessly snubbed by the Tories, who appear to prefer losing seats to working with him, Farage\u2019s campaign has struggled to recover from his devastating speech in Hartlepool on 11 November, when he announced he was pulling candidates out of 317 Tory-held seats, to the stunned silence, then nervous applause, of supporters. There, he told members he was putting country before party and deciding not to split the leave vote. Farage was pegging this dramatic change in direction rather flimsily on a video he had seen on Twitter by Boris Johnson, in which he promised he would not accept an extension of the transition period for Britain leaving the EU beyond the end of 2020. He also said he wanted to negotiate a \u201csuper Canada-plus\u201d trade deal with no political alignment. This was the kind of Brexit Farage could support, although it was not the exact \u201cclean Brexit\u201d he had championed months before in the European election campaign. The Tories did not return the favour, with no candidates stood down and no formal alliance \u2013 leaving Farage appearing weak and without influence. By pulling the handbrake, he squandered any momentum he might have had. Bewilderment about the strategy raged for days, with some members demanding their money back from the party after having paid \u00a3100 to stand in the election. There was more confusion when the Brexit party candidate in the Labour heartland seat of Dudley North, Rupert Lowe, said he was pulling out to give the Tories a shot. This was exactly the kind of seat in which the Brexit party was supposed to flourish, and the incident was indicative of a lack of internal discipline. Days ago, Farage faced the ultimate humiliation when four MEPs, including Annunziata Rees-Mogg, quit the party and urged leavers to vote Tory to deliver Brexit. In north Wales, the reverberations of pulling out of Conservative seats are still being felt. Paul Thompson, 52, from Craig-y-don in Tory-held Aberconwy, said he was \u201cgutted\u201d not to be able to vote for the party in the election. He said that from early canvassing in Clwyd West, also held by the Conservatives, there was a positive reaction towards the party. Sensational stories about the party\u2019s senior figures being offered peerages and positions, including claims that Ann Widdecombe was offered a place in a future Brexit negotiating team by those around Boris Johnson, were brushed off by the Tories. In Peterborough, a mix-up over Farage\u2019s route through the city during his one of his walkabouts meant a first glimpse of the election campaign bus was missed by the assembled press pack. A trip to Dagenham the next day was swiftly scaled back to include local media only. In London, the party\u2019s contract for the British people launch, a version of a political manifesto, was small scale and confusing. Some who attended were left wondering what kind of Brexit Farage really wants. While Farage still enlivens his supporters, he is not the Brexit party\u2019s only strong performer. The businesswoman Michelle Dewberry, from Hull, who stared on the BBC\u2019s The Apprentice, Richard Taylor in Blaenau Gwent \u2013 both from Labour families \u2013 and Paul Whitehurst in Don Valley all spoke movingly of how their communities have been forgotten by Labour. Claire Fox, a former Revolutionary Communist party member who is an MEP for North West England, gave rollicking speeches about how no one truly speaks for democracy. It has also been evident cash is sloshing around, with slick videos produced daily, three election buses, posters and a movable set. Staff working for the party operate in a way that suggests they are part of a far larger political machine and, ever the optimist, Farage believes in life after 12 December and will rebrand the movement as the Reform party. But with a few days of campaigning left, the Brexit party\u2019s balloon appears to be deflating with barely a whimper \u2013 ignored and outmanoeuvred by the Tories and abandoned by some of its own elected officials. Farage\u2019s failure to stand led to accusations of cowardice, though he insisted it would be more effective for him to dart around the country than be fixed geographically fighting for one seat. This election has also marked the end, for now, of Farage\u2019s friendship with the rightwing donor Arron Banks \u2013 a fellow \u201cbad boy of Brexit\u201d \u2013 who in this election has been telling people to vote Conservative. Being shut out by the establishment yet again may leave a bitter taste for Farage. If the Tories win the election and the UK leaves the EU, the rugby club function rooms and their glitter balls may leave him behind.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. It\u2019s been a blast. Here\u2019s your match report. Bye! Scott Brown\u2019s medal has fallen off its ribbon. \u201cI\u2019ve lost it already,\u201d he admits. To be fair, he\u2019s probably got enough already. Glasgow weather latest: Jonny Hayes is visibly shivering as he takes part in Celtic\u2019s victory lap. More from Neil Lennon, who to his great credit is honest and generous in victory: Fraser was awesome today, and he needed to be, because first half we were so flat. We\u2019ve been playing brilliantly, scoring a lot of goals, but we just looked really off it first half. You have to give Rangers credit for that. But we galvanised ourselves, showed a lot of mental strength, scored a great goal and had a chance to make it two. It doesn\u2019t stop here. We\u2019ve got a lot of games between now and the end of the month to forge ahead in the league, but that\u2019s a first trophy in the cabinet. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen less deserving cup final winners. That their goal was offside is just the icing on a very bitter cake for Rangers. Anyway, here\u2019s Neil Lennon: I\u2019m delighted. Disappointed with the way we played at times, because that\u2019s not the standard we set ourselves. We had to ride our luck, there\u2019s no question of that. I shook the Rangers players\u2019 hands because they made the final a good spectacle. But we\u2019ve come through it again. We\u2019re absolutely an amazing team. That\u2019s 10 major trophies in a row. It\u2019s a brilliant day. To go down to 10 men, and the resilience we showed ... I thought we were better with 10 men than we were with 11. Scott Brown lifts the trophy skywards, and as fireworks fly off the Hampden Park roof, yet another Celtic trophy celebration commences. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be one of the all time great goalkeeping performances/clean sheets,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cFraser Forster would be as well retiring now, he\u2019ll never beat that. Without him, Rangers would have won 5-1, at least. Fair play to Celtic though, took their chance. Rangers didn\u2019t.\u201d I refer the honourable gentleman to my previous answer. I think most of Forster\u2019s saves were entirely straightforward, but there were just so many of them that eventually Rangers\u2019 self-belief drained out of them, as if they felt by the end it was barely worth them giving Forster another opportunity to show off. Neil Lennon strolls about in front of the Celtic fans, 10 fingers raised. This is the most remarkable victory, won with an offside goal, their only shot on target. Rangers were fantastic but for Morelos, who could barely do anything right. He had his chances, but inevitably either shot straight at Forster, or high, or wide. Forster made one good save, from a bouncing header, but everything else was pretty easy for him. Fraser Forster, man of the match, has a quick chat: Just went my way today. I\u2019ll take that. Just buzzing for the lads, buzzing for everyone at the club, buzzing for the fans. It just shows how clinical we are. It\u2019s something special. We played some terrible football, but we\u2019ve won the game and as long as you win a final, that\u2019s all that matters. 90+7 mins: It\u2019s all over! Celtic have been pummelled from first to last, and won anyway! 90+7 mins: Kent runs down the right. He has Defoe and Morelos to aim at, but can\u2019t find either of them. Is that it? 90+7 mins: Into stoppage time at the end of stoppage time. 90+6 mins: Celtic win a free-kick in their own area. Morelos vaguely touched someone, a pretty harsh decision. Forster goes down. It\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s bothering him, and eventually, after the physio has come on for a while, it transpires that nothing is. 90+5 mins: Rangers have had 16 shots to Celtic\u2019s five, seven on target to Celtic\u2019s one, 11 corners to Celtic\u2019s one. They trail by a goal with 90 seconds to play ... 90+3 mins: Close! Arfield passes to Morelos, who is played onside by Ajer. He spins onto it and shoots across goal, but the ball zips inches wide of the far post! 90+2 mins: Another terrible Barisic cross. Embarisic, more like. 90+1 mins: Into stoppage time. There\u2019ll be six minutes of it! It\u2019s not over yet! 89 mins: A better cross from Barisic. It heads towards Morelos, who flings himself to the turf rather than win the header. Johnston is on his shoulders, but Morelos was certainly ready to go down. On commentary, Chris Sutton rages that Morelos \u201cshould be booked\u201d for \u201ctrying to con the referee\u201d, but actually on the replays I see a pretty clear push. 88 mins: They do indeed waste that corner. The ball is won back and ends up with Barisic on the left, who hits a hugely embarrassing cross that flies over everyone and out for a throw-in. 87 mins: Jermain Defoe touches the ball! The ball comes in from the right, and he and Jullien fling themselves at it at the near post. It hits both, and Rangers have another corner to waste. 85 mins: Arfield blasts a shot high from too far out. Rangers, despite having an extra man, have not been the same since the penalty save. 83 mins: All the physios are on. Ajer is down for Celtic, and Helander for Rangers. Katic replaces the latter, but Celtic are clean out of substitutions. 81 mins: Rangers win another corner, their 10th. It is no more effective than the previous nine. 79 mins: Celtic put the ball out of play so that Jullien can receive treatment. Rangers refuse to return the ball from the throw-in, keeping it instead and launching an attack that culminates in Morelos thrashing a wild shot high of goal from the edge of the area. 78 mins: Jullien goes down, apparently in pain. Turns out Morelos trod on his heel. Was it deliberate? It\u2019s hard to tell from the replays, but he certainly didn\u2019t try to get out of the way. 77 mins: There\u2019s definitely another goal in this game, which is getting wilder by the minute. A cross from the left is just cleared before Edouard can poke it in, and a couple of seconds later McGregor is booked for a foul on Barisic. 74 mins: Brandon Barker replaces the recently-booked Joe Aribo. 71 mins: Aribo is booked. Sky\u2019s commentary team thinks it was the least he deserves, but it looked to me like he was guilty of doing not very much to a wildly overreacting Jonny Hayes. 71 mins: Jermain Defoe replaces Kamara for Rangers. They have sorely needed his finishing smarts here. 69 mins: What a chance for Celtic to win this! Edouard wins the ball just inside Rangers\u2019 half, spots Johnston sprinting into space to his left and plays him in. Johnston runs into the area, draws McGregor, and sidefoots wide! 67 mins: From a half-cleared corner Jack has a shot which is half-cleared back to him, and his second shot takes probably a couple of deflections on its way into Forster\u2019s arms. 66 mins: Celtic make a tactical change, taking James Forrest off, and bringing Nir Bitton on. 64 mins: Morelos hammers his penalty low and vaguely leftwards, and Forster goes the right way and saves it! It\u2019s a rubbish penalty - if Forster guessed right, he couldn\u2019t fail to save it! 63 mins: The ball ricochets into the path of Morelos inside the penalty area. Frimpong finds himself behind the Rangers forward, and pulls him back! The referee points to the spot, and brings out the red card! 63 mins: Rangers have had six shots on target so far. Celtic have just scored with their first. 61 mins: That\u2019s a travesty in so many ways. Rangers have been massively dominant, they should have had a penalty a few minutes ago, and now they\u2019re trailing to a goal that shouldn\u2019t have stood. Football, eh? Edouard comes on, wins a free kick out on the left, and as it comes in three Celtic players are offside. Jullien, third of the trio, sidefoots a volley in! Somehow they lead! 59 mins: Edouard is now on, and Lewis Morgan is off. 57 mins: Celtic are about to bring on Eduoard. They surely can\u2019t survive much more of this onslaught. 56 mins: Another save! Rangers win another free-kick on the right. It\u2019s lfited into the area, and Morelos meets it at the far post, heads it into the turf and as it bounces towards the net Forster flings out his left glove and pushes it to safety! That\u2019s the best save of the game so far. 55 mins: Jonny Hayes has turned into a one-man free-kick dispensor, sliding in recklessly on the left and then barging Morelos down on the right. 53 mins: Brown fouled Morelos inside the penalty area a couple of minutes back, no doubt about it. So much was going on at the time that the referee entirely missed it, and VAR is not a thing here. 52 mins: Now a low ball comes in from the left and causes panic in the Celtic backline. Aribo looks set to tap it in at the far post when Forster gets a foot to it! 51 mins: A chance for Rangers! The ball rolls to Morelos, whose shot from an unpromising angle to the left of goal rolls across the goalline and wide! 50 mins: The first shot on goal of the second half comes from Tavernier, just outside the penalty area, but it\u2019s not his finest, and flies well off target. 48 mins: A bit of midfield-based sparring to start the second period, with neither defence much threatened thus far. 46 mins: Peeeeeep! They\u2019re off! The players are back out and ready to rock. This has to be decided in the next 45 minutes (or the half-hour after that, or failing that, penalties). Let\u2019s do this! Apparently Mohamed Elyounoussi is being taken off at the break, and 20-year-old Mikey Johnson will come on. A massively encouraging half for Rangers, but can they sustain this intensity for the full 90 minutes? And can Alfredo Morelos locate his shooting boots at half-time? The answers to these and other questions are soon to be revealed. 45+3 mins: Rangers have had eight shots to Celtic\u2019s two, five on target to Celtic\u2019s none, and five corners to Celtic\u2019s one. But it\u2019s goalless at the break. 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there\u2019ll be two minutes or so. 44 mins: Rangers are controlling the end of the half as emphatically as they controlled the start. And most of the middle. Tavernier has a decent crossing chance, but for some reason decides instead to pass straight to Christie, who clears. 41 mins: The first booking of the final goes to Glen Kamara, who having been beaten by Frimpong hauls him back by the waist. 40 mins: What a chance for Rangers! Morelos is played in, but I think he suspects he\u2019s offside (he isn\u2019t - Hayes was behind him and goalside) and thus doesn\u2019t really commit to the finish, which again hits Forster. 38 mins: Any suggestion that the rain had stopped was laughably wide of the mark, incidentally. We\u2019re having a slight pre-half-timely lull. 35 mins: It looks like Ryan Jack has fully recovered. Morelos gives away a free kick for deliberately jumping into a defender, which he\u2019s done a couple of times already. 32 mins: Celtic are starting to threaten more regularly. They launch a threatening break, which ends when Morgan is brilliantly challenged by Jack. But the Rangers player\u2019s studs catch in the turf as he comes in to win the ball, and he\u2019s now receiving treatment to his knee. 28 mins: Chance for Rangers! It\u2019s a long pass down the right, and Morelos gets to it first, runs past Ajer, who commits himself foolishly, cuts into the box and, with no one particularly better placed infield, blasts a shot at Forster! 25 mins: Celtic win their first corner, and Ajer wins the header, but it goes well over the bar. 24 mins: Hayes finds some space on the left, but his cross goes straight to a blue shirt. Rangers need to convert their dominance into goals before Celtic wake up. 23 mins: Another optimistic Morelos shot, and this time Forster makes an easy save. 22 mins: Another corner, another Rangers header, another goal kick. 21 mins: Morelos blasts a shot at goal from wide on the left, and Forster makes a complete hash of the save, letting the ball roll underneath him, but Hayes is first to the loose ball and clears! 20 mins: Celtic do look like they can\u2019t really be arsed with a cup final this afternoon. It\u2019s as if they feel a bit put out at having to play football on a day when Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is on the TV, and haven\u2019t really been able to get over it. 16 mins: Tavernier\u2019s corner is headed by Goldson straight into a defender. 15 mins: Another Rangers corner. Celtic don\u2019t seem to have an outlet here, but they are yet to concede a genuine goalscoring chance. 14 mins: Shot ... and saved! Jack smacks the ball goalwards from 25 yards and it\u2019s dipping beautifully into the top corner until Forster tips it over! 13 mins: It might have actually stopped raining. [inevitable obvious pun dept adds: Rangers are still pouring forward, mind.] 10 mins: Celtic do a thing. It\u2019s not a very good thing, but it must still be categorised as an attack. Morgan is found inside the penalty area, but his first-time shot from an unpromising position is unpromising. 8 mins: Another Celtic corner, but it\u2019s a rubbish one. It loops over the six-yard box, and though Rangers keep the ball they don\u2019t do much with it. 5 mins: It\u2019s been 100% pure Rangers so far. Now Barisic gets down the left, but his cross isn\u2019t great, Arfield doesn\u2019t really commit to the header and the ball ends up bouncing off his back and behind. 3 mins: Now they win a free-kick on the right, and again Goldson wins the header but this time it has neither power nor accuracy. Goal kick. 2 mins: And now an early corner for Rangers. Jullien beats Helander to the header, sending the ball looping into the air, and Forster pushes it behind for another corner. This time Goldson wins it, and thumps a header wide! 1 min: Peeeeeeep! Rangers get the ball rolling, and promptly smack it straight into touch! An email! \u201cJust to pick up on Ewan\u2019s article yesterday, yes, no questioning that Rangers have improved and in doing so have forced us to up our game too, but to say that we Celtic fans fear them is a bit of a stretch,\u201d writes Tom Conniffe. \u201cRespect them as a team, sure, but no great fear. We have better quality right across the park and on our day should deal with them straightforwardly. Of course football can produce surprises, which is why we love it, but they rely largely on a single gameplan - go wide and cross to Morelos - that can be nullified if we keep our concentration. And we have a plan b and c on the bench in French Eddy, Rogic and Johnston, that they just don\u2019t.\u201d Confident talk there. Now Celtic just need to go and win it. The players are in the tunnel! And out they come, as jets of fire burst skywards! The pre-match entertainment is in full swing. Currently Ally McCoist and Chris Sutton are taking turns to wave the trophy at supporters of the teams they once represented, while fans of the other lot boo. And it\u2019s still raining. I\u2019m counting two coats, some extremely thick gloves, a scarf and a bonus plastic poncho here. Your Glasgow weather report in a single image: Neil Lennon says Edouard \u201ccame in yesterday and said he didn\u2019t feel comfortable enough in himself to start the game\u201d. His players, he says, are quiet and focused on winning 10 major trophies in a row: \u201cI might give them a few words of motivation, but the majority have been here and done it before, so it\u2019s nice and calm in there at the moment.\u201d Steven Gerrard says Steven Davis had \u201cno chance\u201d of making this game, and will miss two or three games with a calf injury. Also: Without giving too much away we want to get quality from the sides. You know what dressing-rooms are like now, they have this music on blasting, it\u2019s like a nightclub in there. They\u2019re in a good place, they just need to go and grasp it now. We\u2019ve got to defend well, first and foremost, and when the game presents itself to us to show how good we are from an attacking point of view. It\u2019s important we play the game, rather than the occasion. We have to be the best Rangers if we want to win this trophy. Weather latest: it is absolutely ratting down in Glasgow. The pitch is \u201cabsolutely saturated\u201d and it\u2019s unlikely to stop any time soon. It\u2019s probably wise to establish at this stage what would happen should the scores be level after 90 minutes. Here are the relevant regulations: Basis of Competition 4.5 In all rounds, other than the First Round, the Competition shall be conducted on a \u2018knockout\u2019 basis with the winner being the Club or club with the greater number of goals at full-time. If the scores are equal at full time or no goals have been scored, an extra thirty minutes (15 minutes each way) of extra time will be played (\u201cExtra Time\u201d) and, if the scores are still equal or still no goals have been scored at the end of Extra Time, the winner shall be determined by taking Penalty Kicks. 4.6 If Penalty Kicks are required, the Match referee determines which goal will be used as follows: 4.6.1 if the Match referee determines that either goal could be used for the Penalty Kicks, then, in the presence of the two captains, the referee shall toss a coin to decide which goal will be used; or 4.6.2 if for reasons of safety/security, condition of the field of play, lighting or other reason, the Match referee determines that a particular goal shall be used for the Penalty Kicks, such decision shall be final and require no justification. 4.7 Following the procedure set out in Regulation 4.6, the Match referee shall toss a coin and the Club/club that wins the toss shall decide whether to take the first or second Penalty Kick. The team sheets are in, and these are the names upon them. Steven Davis is the notable absentee from the Rangers side, while Odsonne Edouard is fit enough only for the Celtic bench: Rangers: McGregor, Tavernier, Goldson, Helander, Barisic, Aribo, Jack, Kamara, Arfield, Morelos, Kent. Subs: Defoe, Ojo, Foderingham, Flanagan, Katic, Barker, Stewart. Celtic: Forster, Frimpong, Ajer, Jullien, Hayes, McGregor, Brown, Forrest, Christie, Elyounoussi, Morgan. Subs: Gordon, Bitton, Rogic, Johnston, Ntcham, Edouard, Bolingoli Mbombo. Referee: William Collum. Hello world! Celtic play Rangers in the final of the competition currently known as the Betfred Cup, for Rangers a first League Cup final since they beat these very opponents 2-1 in 2010-11. Celtic have won this pot in four of the last five seasons, beating Dundee United, Aberdeen, Motherwell and Aberdeen again by an aggregate score of 8-0 in those finals, but Old Firm games since Steven Gerrard\u2019s appointment by Rangers have tended to be close, there are only two points between them in the league table and this looks very much like an anything-could-happen situation. Here\u2019s Ewan Murray\u2019s preview: It would be natural for Celtic supporters to have spent recent days in a state of apprehension. For the prospect of their domestic dominance being halted by their Old Firm rivals Rangers is galling. Were Aberdeen, Dundee United or Motherwell to end Celtic\u2019s consecutive trophy haul, which currently stands at nine, there would be joy for the underdog and widespread shock. If Rangers break the spell, the mutual impact would be considerable. For all that Celtic should be the favourites heading into Sunday\u2019s Scottish League Cup final, a Hampden Park showpiece \u2013 likely to be more intense, and bitter, than most knockout football \u2013 supplies no guarantees.

Just four points separate ninth-placed Sheffield United and Southampton, who take on Newcastle this afternoon, in 18th. Graham Potter, for one, is not taking anything for granted and his players must share that mindset after an unforgivingly quick turnaround. \u201cAnything is possible in this league, that\u2019s the way you have to think or else it becomes boring,\u201d Potter said. \u201cWe have to keep working towards what we\u2019re trying to achieve and maintain the spirit around the group.\u201d</p> <p>Wolves are having a better season than many realise, with Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s side qualifying for the knockout stages of the Europa League without breaking sweat and on a 10-match unbeaten run in the top flight. Nuno gave his players a rare day off on Thursday as a reward for their efforts in what has already been a marathon season, with this their 29th match since July. And then they have another five matches before December is out. \u201cI hope [the players] enjoyed their day off,\u201d Esp\u00edrito Santo said. \u201cIt was well deserved and they needed it. It was important they understand it\u2019s a day to rest, recover, stay at home and be with family and join us to be ready for Sunday.\u201d We\u2019ll soon find out how ready they are.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 4.30pm (GMT)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-08T15:54:49.313Z\">at 3.54pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Read Ed Aarons\u2019 report from the Amex: While we wait for the report, a reminder of goings on elsewhere: Aston Villa 1-4 Leicester City Newcastle 2-1 Southampton Norwich City 1-2 Sheffield United Some lukewarm Wolves reaction. Conor Coady says when Wolves look back on that draw they will likely view it as a good point. \u201cIt is probably fair result,\u201d says the skipper. \u201cWe are resilient but you have to be in the Premier League and you have to be able to comeback in games. We want to get in the lead and stay in the lead. Diogo scored two fantastic goals and it is up to us to defend better. Things are going OK but we need to keep going.\u201d Diogo Jota says Wolves should have had a penalty because Brighton\u2019s Lewis Dunk handled in the box. \u201cI was there, one metre away,\u201d he adds. That\u2019s that. The second half failed to live up to much after an entertaining opening 45 minutes. Wolves\u2019 unbeaten run rolls on to 11 games. That draw lifts Wolves up to sixth and moves Brighton another point away from the relegation zone, level on points with Arsenal, who take on West Ham on Monday. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo will probably be the happier of the two managers but both teams squandered chances to clinch victory. 90+2 min: ... Moutinho overhits his cross. Brighton get off the hook. And Nuno withdraws a bruised Traor\u00e9. On comes Ruben Vinagre. 90+2 min: Traor\u00e9 earns Wolves a free-kick 20 yards from goal after Dale Stephens crudely takes out the winger. Moutinho fancies it ... 90 min: There will be three added minutes. Neves just picked out Cutrone with a wonderful ball into the box but the Italian could not generate any power on his header. Cutrone had skirted away from Webster, too. 89 min: Burn tries to find Maupay but overcooks his through ball. Nice idea. Can either team fashion a late winner? 87 min: A route-one ball into Cutrone causes no end of problems for Adam Webster, with Dunk equally missing. Cutrone cuts the ball back in search of Pedro Neto but Brighton rally to make life difficult. For a moment it seemed Neto would sweep home Cutrone\u2019s cross but Brighton made amends for some sloppy defending. 86 min: Jon Moss gives Neal Maupay a nice little ticking off after the striker gives Matt Doherty a shove as the Wolves wing-back takes a throw-in. Nuno has a word with Maupay before Moss prevents any anger from escalating. And now the Wolves substitutes almost combine ... 85 min: Patrick Cutrone replaces Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez. 81 min: Burn is booked for scything down Adama Traor\u00e9 on halfway, abruptly ending Wolves\u2019 hopes of a swift counterattack. Wolves poured forward after Stephens failed to seize on a mix-up between Patricio and Doherty. The goalkeeper and right-back both tried to clear a ball at the back post, leading to a messy scramble in the box. Stephens picked up possession, striding into the 18-yard box but failed to get a shot away. 80 min: Murray tries and fails to buy a corner out of Dendoncker, who has again had a very steady game on the right of a back three. 77 min: Pedro Neto replaces Diogo Jota, who was on a hat-trick for Wolves. Jota gets a little bum-pat as he trudges towards the dugout. A good day\u2019s work for the Portuguese. 75 min: Dunk is booked for taking out Traor\u00e9, just as the Wolves winger went into full tilt. Dan Burn had already caught the winger on halfway before Dunk teamed up on Traor\u00e9, wiping him out as he zoomed towards the final third. Burn has not been too troubled by Traor\u00e9 \u2013 yet. 71 min: Jonny presumably spent half-time watching far too many clips of Davy Pr\u00f6pper. The Wolves midfielder gifts possession straight to the opposition, just as Pr\u00f6pper did for Wolves\u2019 second. Dale Stephens obligingly collects the ball 20 yards from goal and unleashes a rocket. It swerves just wide of Patricio\u2019s right post. A decent effort! 69 min: Maupay bends a shot at goal and Patricio saves! Other than that, not an awful lot to report but Wolves do look rather comfortable. That Potter sought to make changes suggest he is not so happy. As for Maupay, the Frenchman has been a fine signing from Brentford. 68 min: Jahanbakhsh is on for his second Premier League appearance of the season. The Iranian is on for Gro\u00df. Murray replaces Trossard. 65 min: Potter is seeking changes. Glenn Murray and Alireza Jahanbakhsh are stripped and ready for action down in the home dugout. Jahanbakhsh, a \u00a317m signing, is reportedly set to be loaned out in January. 62 min: Burn does well v Doherty to prevent the Wolves wing-back from crossing from the right flank. Back to that penalty shout, a grounded Dunk tried absolutely everything to avoid making any contact with his flailing arms but inadvertently rolled the ball on to his right hand with his head. 61 min: No penalty. 60 min: After a period of nothing, things go mad. Jota tries to stab the ball goalwards and the VAR crew are having a good look at what Wolves believe was a handball by Lewis Dunk. It would be extremely harsh ... 59 min: A bit of a lull at the Amex. Saying that, Wolves supporters are belting out the infectious Si Se\u00f1or, the Ra\u00fal version. 55 min: The corner itself comes to nothing but they recycle things and Leandro Trossard sends a daisy-cutter flying into the advertising hoardings. It was not as wayward as it sounds. 54 min: Maupay makes something out of nothing and ends up earning Brighton a corner after his shot is deflected wide. Maupay had three Wolves defenders for company but none could truly extinguish the danger. 49 min: If Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez is underrated, then Diogo Jota is criminally overlooked. He has been a pest throughout and seems intent on completing his hat-trick. His second goal was wonderfully taken. 48 min: Jota skates on to a neat ball by Traor\u00e9 but Ryan rushes out and whacks it clear for a throw-in. If in in doubt ... 47 min: Burn is alert to Matt Doherty, who made a cracking run into the box from wing-back. A quiet start to the second period. 46 min: Brighton get the second half going. Another four goals? Goals galore at the Amex but Brighton will be cussing. Graham Potter\u2019s side shot themselves in the foot on the brink of the interval to gift Wolves a route back into the game, just as it seemed to be getting away from them. Diogo Jota has twice coolly finished for the visitors, with Neal Maupay and then Davy Pr\u00f6pper on the scoresheet for Brighton. Aaron Mooy almost found a third for Brighton before Pr\u00f6pper cheaply surrendered possession, allowing Jonny to find Jota, who did the rest. It\u2019s a gift from a Brighton perspective. Pr\u00f6pper turns from hero to villain, with his loose ball running kindly for Jonny, who has the nous to pick out Jota in the box. Jota calmly swivels and fires low into the corner. It\u2019s a better finish than he will get credit for. A fourth goal at the end of a lively first half. 42 min: It drops for Neves but Brighton are quick to close the ball down so he spreads play out to Moutinho, who took the corner. But the Portuguese is offside. Suddenly nothing is going Wolves\u2019 way and Brighton, who fly up the other end, are swarming all over the visitors. Brighton force another corner but it comes to nothing. 40 min: Adama Traor\u00e9 runs into a Brighton cul-de-sac, with Dunk and Burn doubling up on the Wolves winger. Wolves corner ... 39 min: And Aaron Mooy almost makes it three! Brighton are stitching together some lovely stuff. Mooy, who influence is growing at Brighton, drags inches wide of Patricio\u2019s right post after some more patient buildup play. Wolves look shell-shocked by that quickfire double. A free header! Aaron Mooy gets to the byline, taking Dendoncker and Doherty with him before nudging the ball into the path of Leandro Trossard. The Belgian digs out a wonderful cross for Davy Pr\u00f6pper to nod in beyond Patricio. Suddenly, Brighton lead; there were just 96 seconds between Brighton equalising and leading. Out of nothing, a rocket by Neal Maupay ripples the Wolves net. Dale Stephens floats a wonderful pass over the top of the Wolves back line and, on the face of it, there seems to be little danger. Maupay has Conor Coady for company but as the ball bounces, the Frenchman smacks a first-time effort at goal, catching the unsuspecting Rui Patricio cold at his near post. It is a sweet strike, and Maupay\u2019s second goal in four days. 33 min: Ryan smothers the ball as Jota gets in behind! Jim\u00e9nez is telepathic and knows exactly where to find his Wolves team-mate and the Brighton goalkeeper comes up trumps to deny Jota a second goal. 31 min: Beyond Jamie Vardy and Roberto Firmino is Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez the best No9 in the Premier League? What do we think? The Mexican is so much more than a goalscorer, too, au fait at bringing others into play, as he did for Jota\u2019s opener. Saying that, he has found the net 15 times this season. 30 min: The omens are not good for Brighton, who have not won any of their past 20 matches at the Amex in the Premier League when conceding the first goal. Still, records are there to be broken and all that. It had been coming. Diogo Jota plays a wonderful give-and-go with Jonny, which frees the forward to drive into the box. Jim\u00e9nez turns provider, surging down the left and into a mammoth gap vacated by Alzate before playing a sliderule cross into the box. Jota makes no mistake, sweeping home from close range. 26 min: Brighton plunge themselves into trouble \u2013 but get away with it! A poor pass by Dale Stephens encouraged Wolves to pour forward and Jota swivelled away from Webster before laying the ball on for Jim\u00e9nez, but the striker could not divert it goalwards. Jim\u00e9nez is hungry to add to his tally. 25 min: Brighton work a clever opening but the final pass for Pascal Gro\u00df is overcooked and the ball runs out for a Wolves goal-kick. 23 min: Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez exquisitely flicks the ball into the net \u2013 but it won\u2019t count. The flag is up, with Diogo Jota straying a yard or so offside. Jota had skated beyond Adam Webster, getting goalside of the Brighton defender before drilling the ball across goal but Jon Moss had long blown his whistle by the time Jim\u00e9nez applied the finishing touch in the box. 18 min: Adam Webster is adjudged to have upended Diogo Jota 25 yards or so from goal and Joao Moutinho swings in the resulting free-kick, which bounces up into Ryan\u2019s hands. The foul stemmed from Jota surging into space vacated by Alzate, who is an attacking full-back in just about every sense. 17 min: Adama Traor\u00e9 is built like a gladiator. Brighton have kept him relatively quiet so far but it is surely only a matter of time before the winger puts on the afterburners up against unorthodox full-back Dan Burn. 13 min: Brilliant save by Mat Ryan! Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez plays a cute first-time ball towards the back post for Sa\u00efss, who gets up to head at goal. It is a decent effort \u2013 Brighton make it difficult for him to generate too much power \u2013 and Ryan gets down low to his right to palm it away. Wonderful thinking by Jim\u00e9nez, who is surely one of the best No9s in the division. 10 min: R\u00faben Neves sends a ferocious effort inches wide! Almost another peach for Neves to add to the showreel. Alzate\u2019s headed clearance is poor and it drops neatly for the onrushing Portuguese, who hammers a first-time strike at goal. His shot whistles just past Mat Ryan\u2019s right post. Neves is a specialist in the spectacular and almost punished a sloppy header by Alzate. 9 min: Wolves turnover possession on halfway through Moutinho, who releases Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez but Brighton crowd out the Wolves talisman. But Wolves will attempt to recycle the ball ... 7 min: Potter is busy scribbling down a few notes but he will be reasonably happy with the start his side have made. Brighton are dominating possession and Wolves have not really had a sniff, aside from piling into a hole left by the marauding Steven Alzate. Nuno continues to survey the scene on the touchline. 5 min: A wardrobe malfunction of sorts for referee Jon Moss, whose cumbersome communication gadgets require a new set of triple As, or something like that. Moss points to his watch as the crowd jeer the brief delay. Lovely stuff. 3 min: An encouraging start by Brighton, with Maupay getting a clear shot away from distance. Maupay tries to slide in Mooy but it is cut out and then the Frenchman decides to take aim from 20 yards. Patricio watches it all the way and comfortably collects in the Wolves goal. The visitors are under the cosh early on. 2 min: Wolves put bodies on the line to deny Maupay! Alzate flies forward from right-back and tries to meet Leandro Trossard\u2019s lofted ball. Alzate is frustrated with himself, which says everything. It was a wonderful chance, though Maupay almost fed off the scraps before Coady intervened. From the resulting corner, Dunk powers a header over. Wolves get things under way at Brighton. There is a wonderful visual nod to the Rainbow Laces campaign at the Amex, where Brighton supporters hold aloft a series of multicoloured placards in the East Stand to make a eye-catching kaleidoscope of colour as the teams enter the pitch. The teams trudge out of the tunnel at the Amex ... A very smiley Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo speaks. \u201cTotally, totally focussed, 100%, we have to keep on going no matter what we did before,\u201d he says, when asked about not getting carried away with Wolves\u2019 unbeaten run. \u201cIt is tough, very demanding and challenge. Today we play against a very good team and we have to compete. The ideas of Graham [Potter] are totally different, compact, organised and good players. We have to be really switched on and play our game. We have to control, we have to manage.\u201d Aston Villa 1-4 Leicester City Newcastle 2-1 Southampton Norwich City 1-2 Sheffield United Only Liverpool are on a better unbeaten run than Wolves. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s side have not been toppled in any of their past 10 matches but they have some way to go until they match Liverpool\u2019s 33-match Premier League record. The lightning Adama Traor\u00e9 v 6ft6in Dan Burn is an intriguing match-up. Graham Potter speaks, and the Brighton head coach knows the size of the task at hand. \u201cWe have to start again,\u201d says Potter, who confirms Connolly misses out with a dead leg. \u201cWe had a good evening but it doesn\u2019t count for anything now and we are playing against a team in really good form that are really hard to beat. We have to go again and we will do our best. It is a different challenge, any team that has gone 10 games without defeat in the Premier League has not happened by accident, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Sunday\u2019s Premier League results Aston Villa 1-4 Leicester Norwich 1-2 Sheffield United Newcastle 2-1 Southampton Over at Villa Park, Jamie Vardy\u2019s running riot. Again: Team news news: Brighton make one change from that victory over Arsenal on Thursday with Leandro Trossard, who laid on the winning goal for Neal Maupay, replacing Aaron Connolly, who failed to shake off a hamstring issue. In Dan Burn, Lewis Dunk and Adam Webster, they have three defenders around the size of Brighton seafront\u2019s i360 tower. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s Wolves, meanwhile, are unchanged. Oh, and in official news Jon Moss is at the Amex despite his framed match-worn referee shirt from the 2015 FA Cup final being stolen from his funky Leeds record shop, which goes by the name of The Vinyl Whistle. So many questions. Brighton &amp; Hove Albion (4-2-3-1): Ryan; Burn, Webster, Dunk, Alzate; Pr\u00f6pper, D Stephens; Trossard, Mooy, Gro\u00df; Maupay. Subs: Button, Montoya, Duffy, Bernardo, Bissouma, Jahanbakhsh, Murray Wolverhampton Wanderers (4-3-3): Patricio; Dendoncker, Coady, Sa\u00efss; Doherty, Neves, Moutinho, Jonny; Traor\u00e9, Jim\u00e9nez, Jota Subs: Ruddy, Vallejo, Bennett, Kilman, Vinagre, Neto, Cutrone Referee: Jon Moss Brighton are presumably still bobbing up and down after beating Arsenal in their own back yard in midweek but remain just three points above the relegation zone. Just four points separate ninth-placed Sheffield United and Southampton, who take on Newcastle this afternoon, in 18th. Graham Potter, for one, is not taking anything for granted and his players must share that mindset after an unforgivingly quick turnaround. \u201cAnything is possible in this league, that\u2019s the way you have to think or else it becomes boring,\u201d Potter said. \u201cWe have to keep working towards what we\u2019re trying to achieve and maintain the spirit around the group.\u201d Wolves are having a better season than many realise, with Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s side qualifying for the knockout stages of the Europa League without breaking sweat and on a 10-match unbeaten run in the top flight. Nuno gave his players a rare day off on Thursday as a reward for their efforts in what has already been a marathon season, with this their 29th match since July. And then they have another five matches before December is out. \u201cI hope [the players] enjoyed their day off,\u201d Esp\u00edrito Santo said. \u201cIt was well deserved and they needed it. It was important they understand it\u2019s a day to rest, recover, stay at home and be with family and join us to be ready for Sunday.\u201d We\u2019ll soon find out how ready they are. Kick-off: 4.30pm (GMT)",

Forster dived to his right to save the penalty, at once lifting Celtic and puncturing Rangers\u2019 spirit. Celtic could and should have guaranteed a more comfortable passage towards the finish line. Odsonne \u00c9douard was not fit enough to start the game but came off the bench just before Jullien scored and was almost the architect of what would have been a definitive second goal. An intelligent, perfectly weighted pass played in Mikey Johnston, who had replaced the ineffective Mohamed Elyounoussi at the break, but as the youngster headed through one-on-one with the Rangers keeper, Allan McGregor, he slipped and pushed his effort wide of the target. It made for a frantic finale to the game as the 10 men of Celtic hung on. There were jubilant scenes from them when the whistle went while Rangers were crushed after having given so much to be left with so little. Rangers\u2019 performance offers evidence to suggest the gap between the sides is as tight as it has been since the club went into administration in 2011. There was guile and spirit about their display, which has not always been the case in these affairs. It would have felt like scant consolation.",

The Chiefs did finish with 14 men after Ben Moon was sin-binned following a series of scrum collapses but, while Diamond acknowledged the visitors \u201cprobably just deserved to edge it\u201d, he could not resist a post-match quip on the subject of the match officials. \u201cI just said to the referee: \u2018Good game and your touch judge has had a brilliant game.\u2019 Hopefully that\u2019ll go through to their assessors and we\u2019ll never see the bastards again in Manchester.\u201d He was quick to stress he was only joking, though his blunt sense of humour can occasionally get lost in translation.</p> <p>His counterpart, Rob Baxter, was simply relieved to have survived \u2013 \u201cThe last 10 minutes were the longest of my life\u201a\u201d \u2013 after Jono Ross\u2019s converted 75th-minute try had set up a grandstand finish in front of a baying home crowd.

The wing slipped the ball inside to Henry Slade who smartly released Hogg and, following a chip ahead, the recent signing was always going to beat Ross to score. He rose groggily to his feet, however, and did not reappear following a head injury assessment.</p> <p>A penalty from Joe Simmonds extended the margin to 15-3 but Sale, to their credit, did not fold. If there was an element of good fortune about their first try, which came courtesy of a charged down Nic White kick which rebounded off Jonny Hill\u2019s lower leg to the lurking Akker van der Merwe, it was reward for their muscular endeavour.</p> <p>Even the busy Van der Merwe, however, had his hands full opposite the outstanding Luke Cowan-Dickie. The England hooker\u2019s work-rate was remarkable even by his own high standards and, with Exeter sniffing a trademark score from a lineout drive, he crashed unstoppably over to register his side\u2019s third try in the opening 25 minutes.</p> <p>Still Sale refused to lie down. They came close to scoring the best try of the day only for the ball to slip from Marland Yarde\u2019s grasp as he rolled over the line and Van der Merwe\u2019s second try, courtesy of an Exeter-style driven lineout, reduced the half-time margin to 22-13.</p> <p>A couple of avoidable misjudgments, including a penalty kick to the corner by Slade which sailed dead, kept the contest alive into the final quarter, however, and a reversed penalty, awarded for a slightly late challenge by Alec Hepburn on Rob du Preez, maintained the suspense.

He rose groggily to his feet, however, and did not reappear following a head injury assessment. A penalty from Joe Simmonds extended the margin to 15-3 but Sale, to their credit, did not fold. If there was an element of good fortune about their first try, which came courtesy of a charged down Nic White kick which rebounded off Jonny Hill\u2019s lower leg to the lurking Akker van der Merwe, it was reward for their muscular endeavour. Even the busy Van der Merwe, however, had his hands full opposite the outstanding Luke Cowan-Dickie. The England hooker\u2019s work-rate was remarkable even by his own high standards and, with Exeter sniffing a trademark score from a lineout drive, he crashed unstoppably over to register his side\u2019s third try in the opening 25 minutes. Still Sale refused to lie down. They came close to scoring the best try of the day only for the ball to slip from Marland Yarde\u2019s grasp as he rolled over the line and Van der Merwe\u2019s second try, courtesy of an Exeter-style driven lineout, reduced the half-time margin to 22-13. A couple of avoidable misjudgments, including a penalty kick to the corner by Slade which sailed dead, kept the contest alive into the final quarter, however, and a reversed penalty, awarded for a slightly late challenge by Alec Hepburn on Rob du Preez, maintained the suspense. The durable Chiefs, though, were not to be denied.

      "bodyText": "The British Horseracing Authority said on Sunday it will look at its procedures for declaring races void in the aftermath of the London National at Sandown Park on Saturday, when an extended delay for a stewards\u2019 inquiry into the race meant many punters who were due a refund on their stakes had already left the course when the decision was announced. Venetia Williams\u2019s popular chaser Houblon Des Obeaux, the winner of three races at the track, suffered a fatal heart attack approaching the end of the first circuit in the race. As vets and track staff attended to the stricken horse on the racing line, the decision was taken to stop the race. A member of the ground staff waved a yellow \u201cStop\u201d flag, warning jockeys to halt racing immediately, as nine remaining runners approached the third last fence. Two jockeys who were trailing the field \u2013 Aidan Coleman and David Noonan \u2013 pulled up but the remaining seven continued round the third-last and continued to race around the home turn and past the screens that had been erected around Houblon Des Obeaux. A stewards\u2019 inquiry was immediately announced and the seven jockeys that continued racing \u2013 Harry Skelton, Adam Wedge, Daryl Jacob, James Davies, Jamie Moore, Stan Sheppard and Philip Donovan, who was first across the line on Doing Fine \u2013 received 10-day bans for failing to stop, which threatens to rule them out of the busy Christmas programme. Richard Hoiles, ITV\u2019s commentator on the race, advised punters to \u201chold on to all tickets\u201d in the expectation of a refund two minutes after Doing Fine crossed the line. Bookies could not make refunds without official confirmation that the race was void, however, and that did not arrive until 4.15pm, 35 minutes after the flag was deployed. Paul Struthers, the chief executive of the Professional Jockeys\u2019 Association, said: \u201cFirst and foremost, our thoughts to go out Venetia, her team and the owners and we shouldn\u2019t let what happened subsequently make us lose sight of that. \u201cWe will be lodging an appeal on behalf of all the riders who were suspended and it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to comment further until after that appeal has concluded.\u201d The BHA will not comment on the specifics of the incident until after the appeal but Robin Mounsey, their spokesperson, said: \u201cOnce the clerk of the course made the decision to deploy the stop race flag, the race will always be declared void. \u201cAn inquiry was immediately announced and the jockeys involved and the clerk of the course were spoken to before announcing a decision, in line with procedures. In future, we will take a look at these procedures to separate out the void race part of the inquiry from the other elements, in order that we can inform racegoers, broadcasters and the betting public as to the outcome of the race more quickly.\u201d Min, the odds-on favourite at 8-11, took the Grade One John Durkan Memorial Chase at Punchestown on Sunday, but not without a struggle to hold off the persistent challenge of Hardline, a 25-1 outsider. Hardline came with a strong run to head Min as they jumped the second-last but Min had regained a narrow lead at the final fence and he stayed on well from there to win by two and a quarter lengths. Presenting Percy, who was making his first start since finishing eighth when favourite for last season\u2019s Cheltenham Gold Cup, was third at 10-1.",

Reality Across the UK, the number of babies born in 2013 was down on 2012, so no Olympic baby boom there, according to the Office for National Statistics. ONS tables for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland showed there were 812,970 babies born in 2012, the year of the games. The following year \u2013 when Johnson\u2019s supposed baby boom would have materialised \u2013 the numbers were slightly down to 778,805 in 2013. So the \u201cparoxyms of joy\u201d that Johnson spoke of after Team GB\u2019s gold medal haul did not lead to a baby boom. In London, the ONS also show a small drop in births \u2013 from 134,186 recorded for 2012 to 128,332 for 2013. But there was a lot of talk about a baby boom in 2013.

But with days to go until the general election was it too much to expect that he might write about the key messages and actions needed to secure a Labour win, or at least to prevent a Tory victory, rather than assuming it\u2019s all over \u2013 even though the fat lady is yet to sing? His analysis is simplistic and presents two key constituencies of past, present and future voters as if they are now, and always will be, irreconcilable. People sink their differences to support a cause they want to get behind \u2013 not just at general elections but around small-scale local campaigns; sometimes in doing so they have to accept that other personal goals will be delayed or get ditched as a consequence, but it\u2019s a price they understand and pay.

The PCT used these findings to set up teams of dedicated health professionals to visit the homes of children who were listed as not having the full complement of vaccinations. During these visits most parents agreed to have their children immunised and rates of MMR2 uptake in particular rose significantly. With cuts to public health budgets, it is unlikely that such a strategy would be considered currently but the health service needs to recognise its own role in these issues as opposed to \u2013 rather conveniently \u2013 blaming parents for reading social media.

      "bodyText": "Magnus Carlsen, the world\u2019s best chess player for the last decade, is on the brink of reaching the top in another game \u2013 fantasy football. The grandmaster is enjoying his best season ever in the Fantasy Premier League (FPL) game and after Sunday\u2019s results he climbed to the sixth position in a table of more than 7 million players worldwide. Carlsen, who is currently competing at the London Chess Classic at Olympia, puts his fantasy football success down to luck. But his FPL team, Kjell Ankedal, has consistently scored high in the overall rankings for the past four years, finishing among the top 3,000 players in the 2017\u20132018 league. This season, it took Carlsen just six weeks to make it into the top 1,000 and he has been climbing up the table ever since. It will not comfort anyone languishing in the FPL\u2019s lower millions to learn that Carlsen is also an occasional model. Asked to comment on his success this season, Carlsen cited the Opta data used by FPL players to track footballing form. \u201cIn fantasy football I\u2019m both an optimist and an Optamist,\u201d he told the Guardian in a one line email. Like many Norwegians, Carlsen is obsessed with both the Premier League and its fantasy league spin-off. In 2017, eight players from Norway were in the top 50 FPL players in the world. Norway has an advantage for FPL obsessives because of the relatively free availability of live matches on the country\u2019s TV channels, compared to broadcast restrictions in other countries. Carlsen likes to relax before matches by kicking a ball about and when he is not playing chess he spends hours watching English football, according to chess journalist Tarjei Svensen, who has known Carlsen since he was eight and follows all of his games. \u201cHis ability at fantasy league has been known for a couple of seasons now, but this season has been exceptional and he\u2019s had another good week,\u201d Svensen said. He added: \u201cHis rise up the charts is incredible. He had a really good year for a while last season and then he dropped a couple of hundred places at the end of the season, but he was still in the top 1,000.\u201d Svensen reckons Carlsen excels at FPL because of a phenomenal memory for Premier League details. \u201cHis level of knowledge about English football is amazing, which must help him a lot,\u201d he says. When a Norwegian film crew stumbled upon Carlsen celebrating France\u2019s victory over Romania at Euro 2016, he was singing a West Ham chant praising Dimitri Payet, the French player who was at the club at the time. In general, the cerebral skills of chess are thought to be a big advantage in fantasy football. Svenson says: \u201cIt is a similar game, it requires planning and strategy. And he has an incredible memory which helps.\u201d The 29-year-old reigning world chess champion tops an elite FPL made up solely of chess grandmasters and is dominating another where Martin \u00d8degaard, a Norwegian prodigy who became the youngest player to represent Real Madrid, is languishing near the bottom of the table. \u201cHe is really competitive at anything he does. Any competition he enters he really wants to win,\u201d Svensen said. This season Carlsen astutely chose Sheffield United\u2019s John Lundstram from the start, as well as bringing in both Liverpool forwards Mo Salah and Sadio Man\u00e9 and Tottenham\u2019s Son Heung-min. He\u2019s also benefited from some good fortune \u2013 such as the moment Wolves\u2019 Leander Dendoncker came off the bench for Carlsen last week to score his only goal of the season so far. Svenson says: \u201cClearly there is some luck but when you do consistently so well, it isn\u2019t luck. He says he has a lot of time on his hands because he doesn\u2019t have a regular job.

      "bodyText": "More than 300 school-age boys, including one 11-year-old, have been strip-searched by the New South Wales police in the past three years. As the NSW police and state government come under increasing pressure to reform the use of strip-searching amid evidence of its widespread misuse, Guardian Australia can reveal that since 2016 police have forced 344 boys between the ages of 11 and 17 to submit to the controversial practice. The latest revelations come after the state\u2019s police watchdog, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, last week held public hearings that heard officers conducted dozens of potentially illegal strip-searches at an under 18s music festival in February. The inquiry heard that one 15-year-old boy who was shaking with nerves was told to \u201chold your dick and lift your balls up and show me your gooch\u201d during a search in which he was unaccompanied by a guardian and in which no drugs were found. The data, obtained by the Redfern Legal Centre under freedom of information laws, reveals that since 2016 there have been 11,304 strip-searches conducted by police on men in NSW. Young men aged 18 to 25 accounted for 42% of the searches, while the oldest man strip-searched was 82-years-old. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were also disproportionately represented in the data, accounting for 10% of the total searches. Of most concern, the figures show that one 11-year old, one 12-year-old and four 13-year-old boys have been strip-searched by police since 2016. The data provides the most complete snapshot yet of the extent to which children are subjected to strip-searches by police after Guardian Australia previously revealed that 122 girls had been strip-searched by police in the past three years, including two 12-year-olds. However, the data is unlikely to capture every strip-search conducted on a minor. The LECC\u2019s inquiry and internal police documents have established that there is confusion among officers about what constitutes a strip-search, and the data did not capture a search conducted on a 10-year-old Indigenous child between 2017 and 2018. Samantha Lee, the head of police accountability at the Redfern Legal Centre, said the data indicated the extent of children in NSW who had been \u201csubjected to an invasive, traumatic and harmful strip-search\u201d. \u201cStrip-searching is traumatising children of all genders and all ages,\u201d she said. \u201cI have found with young male clients who have been strip-searched there is a deep sense of humiliation and isolation, especially for those who have been asked to lift their testicles or made to squat. \u201cDisturbing evidence heard at the recent LECC hearings once again highlights that strip-search law is failing to protect children from harm.\u201d The state government is facing growing calls to reform the use of strip-search powers amid widespread evidence that vagueness in the legislation governing their use means police often do not understand the law. While police are only able to conduct a strip-search in the field in cases where the circumstances are serious and urgent, the legislation provides no guidance on what that means in practice. Last week a senior NSW police officer who has commanded operations at some 20 Sydney music festivals told the LECC he believed the rules governing searches were too ambiguous. \u201cIt should be spelt out what seriousness and urgency is, because I\u2019m sure everyone in this room would have a different opinion,\u201d the officer, who cannot be named, said. It followed separate LECC hearings that examined the allegedly illegal search of a 16-year-old girl at the 2018 Splendour in the Grass festival. That inquiry heard the girl was left fearful and in tears after she was forced to strip naked and squat in front of a police officer who then \u201clooked underneath\u201d her. The search took place without a parent or guardian present, a potential breach of police powers. But Lee said the legislation also failed to consider child protection during the strip-search of a minor. \u201cNot only is the law ambiguous, it lacks the explicit inclusion of child protection principles promoted by all other NSW government services,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt is not only time for the law to change, a complete overhaul of strip-searching practices within the NSW police force is urgently needed.\u201d As part of its investigation the LECC is reviewing whether it is legal for officers to force people to squat during a strip-search, a common practice used by police in NSW. In September, the police published a new personal search manual for the first time which allows officers to instruct people to squat, lift their testicles or breasts, or part their buttock cheeks. In its freedom of information request, the Redfern Legal Centre requested data on the number of men that were required to lift their testicles and/or squat during a search but police said it was \u201cnot possible\u201d to release the information due to the classification of the data and the \u201cvolume\u201d it would be required to search. In a statement, the NSW police said the legislation governing strip-searches contained \u201cadditional safeguards\u201d for children and that officers underwent training on how to conduct them through their careers. \u201cThe NSW police force is committed to continuous improvement and has developed initiatives to standardise operational orders and enhance compliance,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThe recent introduction of dedicated triage officers at events has created another layer of supervision for strip-searches conducted at music festivals. \u201cThe NSW police force awaits the findings of the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission\u2019s review into strip-searches undertaken by police.

      "bodyText": "Traversing a landscape hewn by glaciers, the Overland Track passes jagged peaks, inky lakes and forbidding gorges on a journey into the heart of Tasmania\u2019s wilderness world heritage area. The trail from Cradle Valley to Lake St Clair takes hikers across alpine plateaus, where wildflowers peep out below snowdrifts, through moors dotted with buttongrass and grazing wombats, and into majestic myrtle beech rainforests. It\u2019s bucket-list beautiful. Palawa people have cared for this country for thousands of generations, since arriving during the last ice age. In this remote landscape, their resilience is thrown into sharp relief. While today\u2019s track won\u2019t challenge fit walkers, you can bet the weather will. Almost half the path is above 1,000 metres, and rain, snow, wind and sunshine can come any time of the year \u2026 or all within a single hour. Just three hours into my four-day hike, I find myself soaked, shivering and getting smashed by a hail-blasting gale that keeps knocking me off my feet, sending me crawling through knee-deep snow. In November. Half an hour ago our group of nine reached the trail\u2019s highest point, and on cue granite clouds parted to reveal Cradle Mountain\u2019s turrets towering over a slaty lake. But on a path circling the peak with Jill, a Tasmanian Walking Company guide who\u2019s hauling me up when I fall, the shrieking gusts seem to be sucking the air out of me. I stack it again. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to laugh, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jill says, holding out her hand. And just like that, I do. As the trip goes on, with our TWC guides merely joking that the hail was \u201ca bit rude\u201d, we learn from a ranger that winds of up to 100km/h have closed the trail to independent hikers. Two walkers were winched to safety. Also: just a week ago people were swimming in these lakes! Need to know: The track starts at Ronny Creek near Waldheim, a two-hour drive from Launceston airport. Some hikers take six days to reach Narcissus, then take the ferry across Lake St Clair. Others take an extra day or two to walk the length of Australia\u2019s deepest lake. From there it\u2019s a two-and-a-half-hour drive back to Launceston. There\u2019s a list of transport operators at overland.com.au. Most offer luggage storage. If you don\u2019t have enough time for the full track, it\u2019s possible to walk for three days to Pelion Plains then exit on the fourth day along the Arm River Track to Mersey Forest. You\u2019ll need to arrange for a shuttle to pick you up there. Self-guided hikers setting off between 1 October and 31 May must walk the trail from north to south and book in advance, paying $200 for adults and $160 concession. A parks pass is also required. For less experienced bushwalkers \u2013 and for those who can handle a little more luxury (hot showers, no tents!) \u2013 one of the private operators, TWC, offers four- and six-day hut hikes, with prices starting at $2,795 per person twin share, including meals, passes and transfers. The Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service offers a wealth of information that includes a packing guide and a checklist of the absolute minimum equipment needed. This includes sturdy footwear. On this point I felt confident. But on night one, after 11 hours struggling along slippery, snow-covered boardwalks, I confirm that the boots I bought seven years ago for two treks in Nepal have sprung leaks. (Veteran hikers will have spotted my mistake.) I place them by the fire to dry. (Ditto.) In the morning, as I\u2019m lacing up for another 12km slog, I discover that the soles have come away. Modern boots disintegrate after five years, I\u2019m told \u2013 and overheating mine has trashed them. But there\u2019s freedom in knowing feet can\u2019t get any wetter. Cable ties are applied and off we go. Flora and fauna: Look for bright green cushion plants \u2013 not one species but communities growing together to better battle the elements. But keep to the path: these mounds can take decades to recover from one footprint. Pencil and king billy pines live up to 1,200 years \u2013 if they can survive bushfires. They\u2019re descended from plants that grew on the single super-continent of Pangaea more than 300m years ago. We spot pademelons, wallabies, black cockatoos, wedge-tailed eagles, a pink robin, a peregrine falcon and the grass-green flash of a ground parrot. Our second guide, Ziah, is an encyclopedia of information about the wildlife, stressing that being in this wondrous place and accepting its gifts creates in us the obligation to look after it. Where to sleep: There are tent platforms and public huts at the end of each day\u2019s trek. Bunks are first come, first served. Hidden along the track are TWC\u2019s five cosy huts. They\u2019re designed to be ecologically sustainable, though private accommodation on public land remains anathema to staunch conservationists. Don\u2019t miss: Take a side trip to Old Pelion Hut, a 100-year-old miners\u2019 shelter, to read entries in its visitor book dating from the 1940s.

The Guardian revealed on Friday that an Israel-based group had gained access to at least 21 far-right Facebook pages with vast followings across the western world. The 21 pages were used to coordinate the distribution of more than a thousand \u201cnews\u201d posts each week to more than 1m followers, spreading disinformation and hate targeting Muslims, promoting far-right politicians and vilifying prominent Muslim politicians. The motive for the operation appears to be financial. The Facebook posts funnelled users to a cluster of ad-heavy websites, all controlled by a single entity. After being presented with the Guardian\u2019s findings, Facebook launched its own investigation and pulled down pages and accounts it says were spamming content for financial gain. Facebook said it did not tolerate hate speech on its platform. But the Guardian has learned that, since the original story was published on Friday, Facebook has been telling users that dozens of the posts distributed through the network meet its community standards. The posts cleared by Facebook include one on Australian Facebook page \u201cAssimilate or Migrate\u201d that falsely associates the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, with the quote \u201cThe killing of Jews by Hezbollah is not terrorism\u201d. Another uses an altered image to depict Merkel with blood splattered on her hands and face alongside a story about Germany\u2019s support for \u201cpro-Hamas\u201d resolutions at the United Nations. A third post distorts news about child brides in Turkey to attack Muslims. The posts were distributed across the network in a coordinated way and drive users back to the cluster of websites, milking the traffic for money. One of Facebook\u2019s core community standards is \u201cauthenticity\u201d, which incorporates restrictions on \u201cspam\u201d, \u201cinauthentic behaviour\u201d, \u201cfalse news\u201d and \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d. But, despite this, Facebook told the users that the posts were acceptable. When asked why the posts were deemed acceptable, a spokesman said Facebook\u2019s investigations into the Guardian\u2019s revelations were ongoing. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken action on a number of pages and accounts, some of which were shared by The Guardian Australia, and we\u2019ll continue to take action if we find any further violations,\u201d he said. The network has been partially dismantled since public reports about its existence. Facebook took some pages and accounts offline on Friday. The coordinated content that was spread through the 21 pages has largely ceased. Many of the websites that received traffic from the Facebook posts have been taken down, fully or partially. That has not stopped calls on Facebook to explain why it did not detect the network sooner. Facebook has repeatedly promised to do more to shut down inauthentic coordinated behaviour, particularly in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica and Russian interference scandals. The network uncovered by the Guardian has been operating for two years with relative impunity, and grew significantly in the months since Mark Zuckerberg apologised to the US congress for the company\u2019s failings. Now, the social media giant is being urged to give evidence to a new Senate inquiry into foreign interference on social media. The inquiry was established by the Australian parliament on Thursday to consider the \u201cuse of social media for purposes that undermine Australia\u2019s democracy and values, including the spread of misinformation\u201d. Its chair, Labor MP Jenny McAllister, said Australians expected \u201csocial media platforms to do more\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got this right yet, I don\u2019t think the social media platforms have got this right yet and part of the job of this committee is actually to get all of those stakeholders in the room and create a forum where we can have a really good discussion about what are the boundaries, about what is and isn\u2019t acceptable on these type of matters,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Paul Doyle was our man at Villa Park ... Another big result for Newcastle ... Here is the report from Norwich versus Sheffield United. What next for Villa? They do not look like threatening a back four with the current setup. The hope is Grealish can pull something out of the bag, as no one else looking capable of doing so. EIGHT IN A ROW! Evans: \u201cWe\u2019re up there, we\u2019re challenging, we\u2019re playing well.\u201d Evans thinks people will start talking Leicester up with regards to the title challenge. Chris, from Stockport, has emailed in: \u201cRe your request for sporting memorabilia for your brother, how about a signed, match worn shirt by Aaron Wan-Bissaka from yesterday\u2019s game?\u201d I\u2019ll have a word with Mike Phelan. Ps if anyone knows Mike Phelan, can you email me his mobile number. Duncan Edwards has emailed in! \u201cThink that may be a world record for Grealish in terms of shortest time between dives - and he\u2019s not booked for either. Villa have been treated leniently by the ref and VAR. I\u2019d say they could easily be down to nine men what with the blatant straight red and McGinn\u2019s post-yellow infringements.\u201d Leicester are just too good for the likes of Villa nowadays. They have ripped them apart, aided by Vardy and Maddison being a cut above the Villa defence. They were slick going forward and strong at the back. The hosts, sadly, need a rethink and some new players if they are to stay up. 90 mins: They\u2019ve added three minutes on for no reason whatsoever. 89 mins: All over. Nothing to see here. Red Star Paris gear seems to be the post popular idea for my bro\u2019s Xmas present, you\u2019ll be pleased to know. 87 mins: McGinn goes to ground in the box after Pereira breathes on him. No idea why he would risk a second booking for that. The referee gives no penalty, as the away fans laugh at the midfielder. There is a more credible claim for a penalty when Grealish falls to the floor after Pereira strokes his back. This is pathetic from Villa. Why bother? Elsewhere: Newcastle 2-1 Southampton 85 mins: Surely there is plenty to this. If it was simple, someone would be able to combat it. 83 mins: Everyone streaming out of Villa Park but I am still here, do not worry. The departees almost missed El Ghazi pulling one back but instead he toe poked it wide. 81 mins: Chilwell exits with Justin coming on. The England international has been suffering from a hip injury, so this is quite sensible. There is a minute\u2019s applause for Ron Saunders to celebrate his life, crowned by the 1981 league title. 79 mins: HEATON SAVES IT WITH HIS FACE!!! Maddison whips in the free-kick, Soyuncu flicks it towards goal but Heaton\u2019s noggin\u2019 blocks the ball much to the Turkey defender\u2019s chagrin. 77 mins: Albrighton returns to Villa Park, replacing Praet. Targett has hobbled off with his pride severely injured. Guilbert on. Vardy really is in the form of his life. Praet lifts the ball over the top for Vardy to chase, control and then whack into the corner beyond Heaton. Some say Vardy\u2019s game is a simple one but this Villa defence certainly do not know how to combat it. Now to think of wine. 73 mins: Another chance to finish this game off and allow me to dream of evening wine. Pereira gets round the back, drives a cross to an awaiting Barnes but he is leaning back and flashes a shot well over. 71 mins: Villa really need to sign a striker in January. They can\u2019t carry on with this lineup. I know they spent a lot on Wesley but really he is not going to score the goals to keep them up. Pereira runs out of room when driving towards the byline and ends up on the floor five yards beyond the whitewash after contact with Grealish. There are brief appeals for a penalty but nothing is given. 69 mins: Leicester should be out of sight. Ndidi lifts a ball over the top, which Vardy naturally catches and then lays straight into the path of Maddison but the midfielder misdirects his shot from inside the area and it flies well wide. Chilwell lifts a cross to the back post for Tielemans who is waiting unmarked at the back post but he volleys high into the stand. Elsewhere: Shelvey has equalised for Newcastle. 67 mins: JR asks: \u201cIf VAR is not going to give Targett a red card for that despicable leg breaker on Pereira what is VAR for? Mark it down as another VAR failure. I\u2019ve lost count of how many there have been this season. Hopefully someone is keeping track.\u201d 65 mins: El Ghazi whips a cross into the corridor of uncertainty which bounces along the six-yard line until Pereira whacks it away from danger. The cross really deserved more. Iheanacho departs, with Barnes replacing him. 63 mins: The Villa physios have been very busy today. Now Engels is on the deck after getting one to the face from Iheanacho. There was nothing in it, to be honest. 61 mins: Villa chuck in a couple of crosses into the box but there is no one there who knows how to attack them. Am I missing something with Wesley? He just doesn\u2019t seem very good. Villa are playing with a lot more intent, at least. 59 mins: Douglas Luiz beats Pereira to a loose ball on the left flank and gives him a little nudge in the back. Villa fail to do anything with the free-kick, though. McGinn is the latest to be booked for a rash challenge on Maddison. Trezeguet comes on for Makamba. Hugh Clarke goes off piste: \u201cElsewhere: Viking of Stavanger have won the Norwegian Cup Final for the first time since 2001, with a 1-0 win over Haugesund. Viking\u2019s team includes Christian Thorstvedt, son of former Tottenham goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt.\u201d 57 mins: The cloakroom is open for business. 55 mins: Vardy is given space to drive into the box, Iheanacho darts to the front post but Konsa reads the run and gets to the ball first to clear the cross. 53 mins: I am becoming suspicious that this could end up five or six to Leicester. Villa seem to have lost the plot a little. Elsewhere: Norwich 1-2 Sheffield United Newcastle 0-1 Southampton 51 mins: Targett goes into the book for a filthy challenge on Pereira. He catches him on the shin with his studs, surprisingly late. VAR checks it and sticks to the yellow. Hmmm ... Leicester break once more on Villa, playing the ball from right to left as they move up the pitch. It ends up with Chilwell who lifts a cross into the box but Engels reads it and heads behind. The resulting corner is chipped by Maddison to Evans who heads it into the top corner from 10 yards unchallenged. 47 mins: Iheanacho has a shot within 20 seconds of play restarting but he drags it wide from 20 yards. El Ghazi gets round the back of Chilwell and whacks a cross/shot which Schmeichel tips away. Here we go again! If anyone knows what random football memorabilia I should get my brother for Christmas, please let me know. Elsewhere: Newcastle 0-0 Southampton Norwich 1-0 Sheffield Peter Littley emails in to say: \u201cLooks like Michael Oliver has been to the Mike Dean school of refereeing. Question, if Grealish throws himself into you 4 times, who gets the yellow card?\u201d Yellow cards for all! Fitba! Striker! I was about to write that Leicester were easing to victory against a poor Villa side but Grealish has set it up for a fine second half. The ball bounces around in the box after a Villa corner, then Grealish runs onto the ball and curls the ball into the far corner from the left-hand side of the area. It is checked by VAR but is given. 45 mins: Leicester are just keeping possession here. It looks like the final few minutes of FA Cup tie between a Premier League team and League One opposition. Two minutes added on. 44 mins: More bad news for Villa, as Wesley is lying on the ground off the pitch with his head in his hands. He hasn\u2019t done much, so a change of striker is not a major issue for Villa. Maddison drills in a cross from the left byline which Iheanacho volleys home after getting between two defenders, I think, but it may have come off Konsa. No one seems to know. I will give it to Iheanacho. 40 mins: A bit of anger erupts at Villa Park as Douglas Luiz is taken down belatedly after a shot from the edge of the area and then Grealish claims Schmeichel had turned the ball beyond for a corner but the referee disagrees on both counts. 38 mins: Konsa sends a very short backpass to Heaton but the goalkeeper rushes out to just beat Iheanacho to the ball and avoid catastrophe in the process. Leicester break on Villa and Vardy would have been in if it wasn\u2019t for a defender intercepting Maddison\u2019s through ball. Iheanacho goes into the book for a full-bloodied challenge on Targett. Spicy. 36 mins: Another defensive issue for Villa, as Targett goes down in a heap, complaining about a foot issue but he seems OK to continue. Makamba goes into the book for a late challenge on Ndidi. 34 mins: Chilwell sends a cross over everyone and it is picked up on the opposite flank by Pereira, who is quickly flattened by Targett. Elsewhere, Tettey has put Norwich 1-0 up against Sheffield United. 32 mins: Pereira takes down Douglas Luiz on the left touchline and the subsequent free-kick looks dangerous but is flicked clear by a defender. Vardy once again gets the other side of the defence to catch a through ball, he drives into the box and looks to lay it off to an onrushing Iheanacho but Engels slides in to divert it back to Heaton, removing the danger in the process. The players are flying to tackles now and with the pitch looking very slick due to the rain, this could be fun. 30 mins: Aston Villa seems very keen to get the ball to Grealish as often as possible but they are finding it tricky to do so. He seems to have drifted further to the left in order to find some space. 28 mins: Leicester are knocking it around and making Villa chase the ball around. Villa are holding on here and not much more. Can they ride out the storm? Heaton runs 30 yards out of his goal to head clear a long kick from Schmeichel, which is the sort of thing I like to see. 26 mins: In response to Gary\u2019s question in the last post: I am a huge Vardy fan; so few players nowadays make such an intelligent set of runs as Vardy, not to mention his ability to conserve his energy throughout, allowing to permanently be able to break through a defence. 24 mins: In even less surprising news than Vardy scoring, Mings finally calls it a day due to his hamstring issue. Did his injury help Vardy score? Probably. El Ghazi almost levels things for Villa by heading Targett\u2019s free-kick onto the top of the net. Down the other end, Vardy goes through agains but gets the ball stuck under his feet when one-on-one with Heaton, allowing the defence to recover and clear. Brilliant comedy for a Sunday afternoon. Vardy makes a fine trough in between the two centre-backs, rounds the goalkeeper but then only flicks the ball towards goal, meaning it ends up trickling away from him and it looks like the chance has gone but then Konsa falls over, allowing Vardy to re-take control of the ball and fire it home from a few yards. 20 mins: I say Engels is coming on but the physios are still treating Mings in the hope defender\u2019s hamstring is still working and can it inexplicably looks like he can carry on. Shows what I know about physiology. 18 mins: Mings\u2019 hamstring now seems to have gone. What a miserable afternoon he\u2019s had. I have the same issue in the cold weather. Engels to come on. 16 mins: Vardy is biding his time up top - he is yet to see much of the ball and is having to find different positions to normal as he is part of a front two, which is a rare treat for the former Fleetwood striker. 14 mins: Mings takes a poor touch and is tackled by Pereira on the edge of his own box, but the England defender \u2018rectifies\u2019 the problem by rugby tackling the full-back to the ground, picking up a booking in the process. Maddison hits the free-kick from the edge of the box but Heaton is there to punch it clear. Mings might come to regret that yellow card later. 12 mins: Villa hit the bar! Targett flashes a cross into the box from the byline, with El Gahzi waiting on the edge of the six-yard box but he can only direct the ball onto the bar with the goal gaping. They will struggle to get a better chance. 10 mins: A free-kick is limped into the box by Maddison, Soyuncu pulls it back for Evans but hits it straight at Heaton from a couple of yards. 8 mins: Hopefully the conditions will not impact on the quality of the match, as the players suffer from driving rain and plenty of wind. Elmohamady cuts through the defence, flashes a pass to Grealish who plays it to Douglas Luiz on the left but his cross is cut out by Evans. 6 mins: Aston Villa whip in a corner from the right which Schmeichel struggles to claim on two separate occasions but the referee takes sympathy on the \u2018keeper and awards a free-kick. It has just started to absolutely lash it down at Villa Park! Relentless rain. 4 mins: Iheanacho drives into the box and slips in Maddison, who fires in a low shot form six yards which is blocked and then the ball is lifted to Vardy but he makes a poor connection on a volley and it bounces into Heaton\u2019s arms. 2 mins: Leicester are playing a kit I would describe as charcoal grey. El Ghazi gets in down the right and fizzes in cross but it comes to nothing as Douglas Luiz takes down Evans when challenging for a loose ball. Peep! Peep! Peep! Let\u2019s get ready to rumble! There will be a minute\u2019s applause before kick-off in honour of Saunders. There is a group of former Villa players on the pitch as the club prepare to pay tribute to Ron Saunders. GOALS! GOALS! GOALS! Let\u2019s all hope there is plenty of VAR today. There are a couple of other 2pm kick-offs, with Newcastle hosting Southampton, while Norwich play Sheffield United. I will give you the odd update on those, too. Jamie Vardy is top of the charts! Sky Sports are currently showing a feature with Ben Chilwell and James Maddison chatting with Leicester City\u2019s LGBT fan group, which is nice to see. The two players are speaking very openly, listening to the views of the fans and look very happy to learn. Leicester will be eyeing a spot in the Champions League next season ... I am trying to work out where Iheanacho will play. Will he be down the middle with Vardy coming in from flank? Will they be a front two with a diamond behind them? So many options. Paul Doyle on Brendan Rodgers ... Some sad news from Aston Villa yesterday. The interesting news is that Brendan Rodgers has rewarded Kelechi Iheanacho for his cameo last weekend with a start today. Aston Villa: Heaton, Elmohamady, Konsa, Mings, Targett, McGinn, Nakamba, Douglas Luiz, El Ghazi, Welsey, Grealish. Subs: Nyland, Lansbury, Hourihane, Trezeguet, Engels, Guilbert, Kodjia Leicester: Schmeichel, Pereira, Evans, Soyuncu, Chilwell, Ndidi, Praet, Tielemans, Maddison, Iheanacho, Vardy. Subs: Ward, Justin, Morgan, Gray, Albrighton, Barnes, Perez. Good afternoon! Folk say Leicester City have been the surprise package of the season, as they sit second in the table and currently look like the only team capable of challenging Liverpool for the title but I am not shocked at all. The last time the Foxes won the Premier League it was, frankly, a bit of a fluke with everything going their way. Once again they are keeping pace at the top of the table and they look like they can maintain it until May. Aston Villa are back in the big time but are likely to spend the season battling at the bottom of the table. They currently sit 17th, one point above the relegation zone. They have some interesting players with Wesley and Trezeguet promising plenty but are yet to look like the sort of attackers who will lead the club to safety but there is still time to bed them in. Jack Grealish, however, is the sort of player who can drag a team to the verge of safety. He has been their standout player for a few years now and is certainly doing the required business in the Premier League, as he recently proved at Old Trafford and he will be hopeful of doing similar today. I am actually pretty excited by this one. Kick-off 2pm (GMT)",

However, a spokesperson for the National Education Union (NEU) said such paperwork was pointless if it was not held within the building it related to for staff to refer to.</p> <p>Critics said the findings pointed to a system in which overstretched school leaders were struggling to keep their buildings safe after years of budget cuts.

One teacher in a primary school in Teesside said she worked in a 26-year-old portable building with windows that would not open and others that would not close.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a horrendous cold draft, so I often have to sit with my coat on with the children coming in,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to shut for a week last year because of a massive rat infestation.\u201d</p> <p>She helped to fix a leak in her classroom because the school could not afford to call a plumber. \u201cI know the state of the school budget and I know that lots of schools in the area have faced restructuring and redundancies and I don\u2019t want us to become one of them,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said schools across the country were in dire need of repair, but the funding was not available. \u201cThat failure to invest has left our children and hard working school staff at risk, trying to teach in buildings that are crumbling around them,\u201d she said. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/04/free-breakfasts-to-form-part-of-labour-plan-to-poverty-proof-schools\">Labour has pledged </a>to<strong> </strong>spend \u00a37bn on repairs and upgrades to school buildings in England.</p> <p>Upon arriving in office in 2010, the Conservatives scrapped the previous Labour government\u2019s Building Schools for the Future scheme, a \u00a355bn programme to rebuild every secondary school in England. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/22/government-spending-billions-on-free-schools-while-existing-schools-crumble\">By 2017</a>, the National Audit Office (NAO) warned the condition of schools was worsening, with about 40% of the schools estate built between 1945 and 1976 coming up for replacement or major refurbishment.</p> <p>The NAO estimated it would cost \u00a36.7bn to bring existing school buildings up to a satisfactory standard, a figure that was expected to double over the course of five years to 2020-21.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://neu.org.uk/press-releases/neu-state-school-and-college-buildings-survey\">a survey conducted by the NEU last month</a>, 47% of members said the school or college buildings they worked in were not fit for purpose, with 65% blaming funding cuts. Twenty-two per cent said the condition of the buildings had lead to an unsafe environment for pupils and staff.</p> <p>The issue of health and safety in schools was highlighted in July when the Guardian revealed that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/04/700-english-schools-reported-over-asbestos-safety-concerns\"> nearly 700</a> had been referred to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) over concerns they were failing to safely manage asbestos in their buildings.</p> <p>Lucie Stephens has campaigned for asbestos to be removed from school buildings since her mother, Sue, a former teacher, died of the asbestos-caused cancer mesothelioma in 2016. She said the discovery that<em> </em>more than one in 10 schools did not have the legally required documents on site was horrifying.</p> <p>Stephens has <a href=\"https://toxicschools.org.uk/\">launched a website</a> that aims to show parents and pupils that schools contain asbestos, but has accused the DfE of a lack of transparency for refusing to release the necessary data. The HSE advises that asbestos is only a risk if it is disturbed or damaged, which releases fibres into the air.</p> <p>Responding to the findings, the schools minister Nick Gibb said: \u201cThe Conservative government provides money annually to improve the condition of school buildings. In this academic year, over \u00a31bn has been made available. We also recently announced a \u00a3400m fund for schools to improve their buildings.</p> <p>\u201cA Conservative majority government would build on that record with \u00a314bn over the next three years, and by increasing the minimum level of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 December 2019.

      "bodyText": "Buildings at more than one in six schools in England require urgent repairs, a Guardian investigation has found, leading to warnings that they are \u201ccrumbling around teachers and pupils\u201d. Almost 4,000 schools across the country have been judged by surveyors to be in need of immediate restoration work, and many more were found not to have the paperwork required by law, including electrical test certificates, fire risk assessments or asbestos management plans. According to data gathered through a government programme to assess the condition of England\u2019s schools estate, 17% (3,731) were found to have buildings with \u201celements\u201d, such as a roof, wall or window deemed in need of immediate replacement or repair. Of the 21,796 schools for which information was released, 1,313 had elements that were given the worst possible condition grade D, defined as \u201clife expired and/or serious risk of imminent failure\u201d. Seven hundred and five schools had more than two elements awarded a grade D, while 69 had more than 10. The data, which was obtained though freedom of information requests, were gathered through the Department for Education\u2019s school condition data collection (CDC) programme, launched in early 2017. As part of the scheme, surveyors visited every government-maintained school in England to collect data about the physical condition of school buildings and how they are managed. Schools were also asked to fill in a survey before the surveyor\u2019s visit to provide information about its buildings. According to FOI data, 2,939 schools \u2013 14% of the 20,854 respondents \u2013 did not have an asbestos management plan; 2,717 (13%) did not have a fire risk assessment; 2,215 (11%) did not have a gas safety test report; and 2,098 (10%) did not have an electrical test certificate. The Department for Education (DfE) said that in some cases the documentation could have been held off-site by the multiacademy trust managing the school. However, a spokesperson for the National Education Union (NEU) said such paperwork was pointless if it was not held within the building it related to for staff to refer to. Critics said the findings pointed to a system in which overstretched school leaders were struggling to keep their buildings safe after years of budget cuts. Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the NEU, said the figures highlighted the effect of failure to invest in a crumbling educational infrastructure and that teachers, other staff and pupils deserved better. He added: \u201cIt makes no sense for important practical documents, required by law, not to be held on the premises of a school or college. The reason the government gives \u2013 that they may be held by a multi-academy trust would be laughable if it weren\u2019t so serious. If they are missing how can the risk be safely managed?\u201d Teachers across England told the Guardian they were having to work in buildings so cold they had to keep their coats on, with damp walls and infestations of vermin. One teacher in a primary school in Teesside said she worked in a 26-year-old portable building with windows that would not open and others that would not close. \u201cThere is a horrendous cold draft, so I often have to sit with my coat on with the children coming in,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to shut for a week last year because of a massive rat infestation.\u201d She helped to fix a leak in her classroom because the school could not afford to call a plumber. \u201cI know the state of the school budget and I know that lots of schools in the area have faced restructuring and redundancies and I don\u2019t want us to become one of them,\u201d she added. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said schools across the country were in dire need of repair, but the funding was not available. \u201cThat failure to invest has left our children and hard working school staff at risk, trying to teach in buildings that are crumbling around them,\u201d she said. Labour has pledged to spend \u00a37bn on repairs and upgrades to school buildings in England. Upon arriving in office in 2010, the Conservatives scrapped the previous Labour government\u2019s Building Schools for the Future scheme, a \u00a355bn programme to rebuild every secondary school in England. By 2017, the National Audit Office (NAO) warned the condition of schools was worsening, with about 40% of the schools estate built between 1945 and 1976 coming up for replacement or major refurbishment. The NAO estimated it would cost \u00a36.7bn to bring existing school buildings up to a satisfactory standard, a figure that was expected to double over the course of five years to 2020-21. In a survey conducted by the NEU last month, 47% of members said the school or college buildings they worked in were not fit for purpose, with 65% blaming funding cuts. Twenty-two per cent said the condition of the buildings had lead to an unsafe environment for pupils and staff. The issue of health and safety in schools was highlighted in July when the Guardian revealed that nearly 700 had been referred to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) over concerns they were failing to safely manage asbestos in their buildings. Lucie Stephens has campaigned for asbestos to be removed from school buildings since her mother, Sue, a former teacher, died of the asbestos-caused cancer mesothelioma in 2016. She said the discovery that more than one in 10 schools did not have the legally required documents on site was horrifying. Stephens has launched a website that aims to show parents and pupils that schools contain asbestos, but has accused the DfE of a lack of transparency for refusing to release the necessary data. The HSE advises that asbestos is only a risk if it is disturbed or damaged, which releases fibres into the air. Responding to the findings, the schools minister Nick Gibb said: \u201cThe Conservative government provides money annually to improve the condition of school buildings. In this academic year, over \u00a31bn has been made available. We also recently announced a \u00a3400m fund for schools to improve their buildings. \u201cA Conservative majority government would build on that record with \u00a314bn over the next three years, and by increasing the minimum level of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 December 2019. And earlier version referred in the headline and text to \u201cnearly one in five\u201d, rather than \u201cmore than one in six\u201d, schools.

      "bodyText": "With days to go before the election, there is little sign recent campaigning has had any dramatic impact. A crop of five weekend polls put the Conservatives 11 points ahead, a widening of the Tory lead by about one point, compared with rolling averages. Boris Johnson\u2019s party\u2019s poll rating levelled out at about 42%-43% a fortnight ago, but that is easily enough for a majority if Labour does not close the gap. Overall, it would not be a much better national vote share than the 42.34% secured by Theresa May in 2017, but the question this time is how the votes are distributed. Labour has improved over the past fortnight to about 33%, but it is not obvious that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party is doing enough to force a hung parliament. Those who like to reflect on the experience of 2017, where the party staged an impressive late comeback, should look at the average polling graphs compared. The graph tells a clear story: Labour is consistently increasing in a way that mirrors 2017 \u2013 but at each equivalent stage, Corbyn\u2019s party is a few points behind this time around, and if anything, the gap is slightly widening. As for the weekend polls, the bulk of the fieldwork for the five surveys was conducted between Wednesday and Friday \u2013 after Donald Trump\u2019s relatively low-key visit, during which he did not say the NHS would be \u201con the table\u201d in trade talks, and at a time when further complaints about antisemitism among some Labour members were made by party staffers. Only one of the five surveys from Deltapoll conducted any fieldwork on Saturday, after the head-to-head debate on the BBC on Friday night, in which Corbyn gave a serious, considered performance and tried to call out his rival for \u201cracist remarks\u201d in his past writings. Watch the pre-election polls to see if the TV debate has made any difference. It might: interestingly, according to Ipsos Mori, Corbyn\u2019s low personal ratings have improved from -60 to -44 since November, while Johnson\u2019s have slumped from +2 to -20. The sum is those who are satisfied with their performance as leader minus those who are not. The big difference with 2017 is the improved relative performance of the Liberal Democrats. Jo Swinson\u2019s party has been squeezed since her appearance on Question Time on 22 November, but even with an average of 12%-13%, the party is five points ahead of where it finished at the previous election, helped by the Lib Dem anti-Brexit stance and worries in some progressive voters\u2019 minds about antisemitism. What may hurt the Conservatives is tactical voting. Some recent seat-by-seat polling is suggesting the Lib Dems could take pro-remain seats from the Conservatives where Labour cannot, most notably Guildford \u2013 opening up the possibility of more Tory losses in London and the south-east than anticipated. But that may not mean much if the Conservative vote continues to hold up in Scotland, and Johnson\u2019s party can gain at least the dozen seats where Labour has a majority of less than 2,000 votes, and that voted 55% or more for leave. Another recent constituency poll has the Conservatives taking Wrexham, the seat with the largest majority of those dozen, by a landslide. This close to an election, it is prudent to be wary of polling. But unless something dramatic occurs, Boris Johnson is heading to Downing Street with an overall majority.",

The situation is tricky for the selectors; it is complicated for Moeen as well but also liberating. Unlike the cricketers of the past Moeen and an increasing number of others can plot their own career path. Now that he is not bound by a Test contract Moeen is in demand; leaving aside Worcestershire, which has always been a welcome haven for him, the T20 franchises around the world are interested in his talents. He has plenty of options open to him as cricketer away from the Test arena. The one snippet of consolation for Root, who would like him back especially with Sri Lanka on the horizon, was relayed by Smith: that Moeen still feels he has Test runs and wickets in him. But that is a long way from a cast-iron guarantee of his return.",

Tiredness is: \u201cI\u2019m lacking energy and concentration, I\u2019m irritable. I\u2019m not motivated.\u201d Sleepiness, however, is: \u201cI am battling to stay awake. When I sit on the bus I\u2019m nodding off.\u201d Sleepiness is usually a sign of a sleep disorder or not getting enough sleep, whereas tiredness could be caused by many things \u2013 stress, pain, anaemia or hormone problems most commonly. If you have concerns about your sleep, Selsick recommends getting specialist help via your GP.</p> <h2>Resist box-set temptation</h2> <p>The way Selsick sees it: \u201cStaying up for an extra half hour just to watch one more episode of a TV show can leave you feeling tired and rotten for 16 hours of the next day. Whereas that extra 30 minutes of sleep could have you feeling better for 16 hours of the next day. That\u2019s a very good return on investment.\u201d Giving yourself an extra 30 minutes in bed, five nights a week, he says, can make a significant difference. It won\u2019t necessarily happen straight away, he warns, \u201cbecause if you are walking around with a sleep debt, it takes time to pay off that debt\u201d. He recommends trying it consistently for a month, and if you don\u2019t feel any better, then sleep may not be the problem and you need to investigate further.</p> <h2>Grownups need bedtime routines, too</h2> <p>\u201cAvoid alcohol, nicotine, caffeine and other stimulants before bed and don\u2019t eat large meals late in the evening,\u201d says Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs. Watch your exposure to blue light, too. \u201cWatching TV and using digital devices such as smartphones and tablets can increase alertness. Make sure your bedroom is sleep-friendly: dark, quiet and tidy.\u201d There is good evidence, he says, \u201cthat exercise can reduce stress, which can help with sleep \u2013 but it also gives you energy so avoid doing it for a couple of hours before bed.\u201d</p> <h2>Don\u2019t let your phone wake you up</h2> <p>Phones buzzing or lighting up during the night are a sleep menace, says Selsick. We all wake up a few times and that is completely normal. \u201cIt\u2019s what stopped our ancestors getting eaten,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wake up, check our environment and go back to sleep. But what we see a lot in the sleep lab is people wake up, and the first thing they do is reach for the phone. It\u2019s keeping them awake for longer periods during the night.\u201d If you are adamant about taking your phone to bed, to use as an alarm clock or in case of emergencies, \u201cideally, the phone should be left charging under your bed so that you\u2019re not tempted to reach for it in the middle of the night\u201d.</p> <h2>Eat protein with every meal and snack</h2> <p>\u201cDoing so will help to keep your blood sugar balanced,\u201d says the registered nutritional therapist Jackie Lynch, author of Va Va Voom: The 10-Day Energy Diet. \u201cThis will help you avoid the dreaded mid-afternoon energy slump. And foods that are rich in protein also often contain iron, an extra bonus for anyone who is borderline anaemic. Meat, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds and pulses are all good sources.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Democratic chairman of the House judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, has not ruled out including evidence from the Mueller report in articles of impeachment against Donald Trump that could be published as early as next week. On Sunday, Nadler told CNN\u2019s State of the Union evidence showed the president\u2019s conduct in the Ukraine scandal was part of \u201ca pattern\u201d, indicating \u201cthat the president put himself above this country several times\u201d. On Monday Nadler\u2019s committee will hold a critical hearing. Democratic and Republican lawyers from the House intelligence committee will testify following a months-long investigation of the president\u2019s attempts to have Ukraine investigate a political rival for his own political gain. Nadler said on Sunday Democrats had presented \u201ca very rock solid case\u201d that Trump abused his power, and would get \u201ca guilty verdict in three minutes flat\u201d if the case was presented to a jury. He has suggested that after the hearing concludes his committee will work quickly to publish impeachment articles, which could be voted on before Christmas. The scope of these articles has been the centre of significant debate in the Democratic party, with a number of centrists elected in swing districts keen to keep the focus on Ukraine rather than broader evidence included in the Mueller report into Russian election meddling in 2016, which documented evidence of attempted obstruction of justice by the president. While Nadler made no commitment to including evidence from Mueller, he argued on CNN that Trump \u201csought foreign interference in our election several times both in 2016 and in 2020. That he sought to cover it up all the time. And that he continually violated his oath of office. \u201cAnd that all this presents a pattern that poses a real and present danger to the integrity of the next election.\u201d Other senior Democrats, including the House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, appeared to urge their colleagues to keep the impeachment articles focused on Ukraine. Appearing on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation, Schiff, a former US government prosecutor, said it had been his \u201cguiding philosophy\u201d to \u201ccharge those that is the strongest and most overwhelming evidence and not try to charge everything even though you could charge other things\u201d. For impeachment to pass the Democrat-controlled House and move to a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, two votes are required. First, the House judiciary committee must vote with a simple majority to confirm a resolution that the full House should vote on the articles of impeachment. Then the full House most vote on the articles of impeachment, with a simple majority required to impeach the president. Nadler\u2019s committee released a report on Saturday laying out the constitutional grounds for impeachment, an update to reports published in 1974 and 1998 during impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Shortly after the report\u2019s publication, Trump once again branded the inquiry \u201ca witch-hunt\u201d and \u201ca total hoax\u201d. Over the weekend, Trump told reporters that his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, would provide Congress and the attorney general, William Barr, with \u201ca report\u201d containing \u201ca lot of good information\u201d about his recent trip to Ukraine. Giuliani, who holds no official title in the White House, is at the centre of the Ukraine scandal for his role in an unofficial diplomatic back channel tasked with pushing the Ukranian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, into investigating the former vice-president Joe Biden as well as an unfounded conspiracy theory suggesting Ukraine was involved in election meddling during 2016. Giuliani\u2019s trip to Ukraine, reported this week, drew criticism after he met with a number of former officials central to the impeachment inquiry. On Sunday, Republicans loyal to Trump defended the president from all allegations of impeachable behaviour and, in the case of the Texas senator Ted Cruz on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, continued to push the line that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. But they also criticised Giuliani\u2019s travel to Ukraine. The Florida congressman Matt Gaetz described the decision as \u201cweird\u201d and suggested that Trump had confirmed Giuliani would appear before Congress, despite the White House blocking most involved in the scandal from testifying. Cruz captured the tenor of Republican defences of Trump \u2013 and pointed to his likely survival in office \u2013 when he told NBC: \u201cThis is a kangaroo court.

AJ Buy it for: someone who loves to entertain Sardine: Simple Seasonal Proven\u00e7al Cooking By Alex Jackson The cookbook of the small Old Street restaurant of the same name. Yes, the cooking of the south of France has been well \u2013 and beautifully \u2013 trawled by some of our favourite food writers, the likes of Elizabeth David, Alice Waters and Richard Olney. But this is a quietly compelling work that makes its own case for inclusion. Jackson is a talented writer and cook with an inquisitive mind who wears his knowledge lightly. AJ Buy it for: the terrific chocolate, hazelnut and pear tart Mandalay: Recipes and Tales From a Burmese Kitchen By MiMi Aye This will likely be an introduction for many to an underappreciated cuisine, partly because of the politics of the place. Worry not, you are in excellent hands. Aye is a gifted recipe writer and opinionated champion of the food of her family (see, for instance, the short section on \u201cWhy MSG is A-OK\u201d). This is a book to read as well as cook from, packed with evocative imagery. AJ Buy it for: the fish noodle soup, stay for the duck egg curry From the Oven to the Table By Diana Henry There\u2019s so much to love about the latest from the Sunday Telegraph writer. Although subtitled Simple Dishes That Look After Themselves, don\u2019t be lulled into thinking there isn\u2019t a keen and current cooking brain creating these recipes (roast cabbage and XO crumb, anyone?). Its great strength lies in updating and upgrading food you\u2019ll want to produce with a flourish. Deliciously photographed, too. AJ Buy it for: turning a meal into a special occasion Pasta Grannies By Vicky Bennison It\u2019s no secret that Nonna\u2019s cooking is best. And now the wisdom and recipes from Tuscany, Puglia and Sardinia\u2019s finest home cooks are all in one place. From 79-year-old Vanda\u2019s tagliolini with shrimp to 97-year-old Giuseppa\u2019s fingernail pasta with tomato sauce, there is enough pasta inspiration here to last until you, too, can cook as well as an Italian grandmother. MT-H Buy it for: the stories behind the nonnas\u2019 most treasured dishes Zaika: Vegan Recipes from India By Romy Gill Saturated in memories of a happy Bengali childhood, infused with a subtle hint of sadness at her much-loved mother\u2019s recent death, this is Bristol-based chef Romy Gill\u2019s first book. Centring on vegan dishes because it is the food she grew up with, it would be easy to think you might live well eating and cooking from here. Dishes that caught our eye: the roti, the saag and her famous samosas. AJ Buy it for: its clarity and its evocation of love My Last Supper By Jay Rayner Why wait, asks OFM columnist Rayner, why not eat your last meal right now, when there\u2019s time to enjoy it? You can always take stock of your life so far, as he does in this left-field memoir, with dishes and ingredients a chance to reminisce \u2013 the excellent chapter on salads takes in a teenage drug-bust that makes the national press. There\u2019s plenty of professional wisdom, too, including an explanation of why, if a restaurant\u2019s chips are good, the rest of the menu probably will be too. GG Buy it for: someone who plans every meal, no matter how far ahead The Whole Fish Cookbook By Josh Niland Subtitled New Ways to Cook, Eat and Think, and for once this doesn\u2019t feel like hyperbole. There is a clear idea captured here that runs through these pages like, well, a fish backbone: that we don\u2019t treat food from the sea in the way we should; that something akin to \u201cnose to tail\u201d eating is called for because of deliciousness and respect. There are smart thoughts here on dry-ageing, curing and butchery, a whole \u201cfabulous fish philosophy\u201d. A bit cheffy sometimes, but an important book. AJ Buy it for: someone with an open mind and a sharp knife Tartine: A Classic Revisited By Elisabeth Prueitt &amp; Chad Robertson Along with Tartine Bread, this is one of the more influential baking books of recent times, the titular San Francisco bakery inspiring similar operations around the world. Like their work, this updated version is precise and beautiful, with 68 new recipes, tweaks to 55 old favourites, plus exceptional new photography. Now you don\u2019t need to travel halfway round the world to eat their morning buns. GG Buy it for: patisserie fiends Eat Run Enjoy By Billy White Requiring serious training, many hours on your feet, with no guarantee of success \u2013 endurance running and high-end cooking are similar, says Stockholm-based British chef White. And he should know. He excels at both, though you don\u2019t need run 100-mile trails to appreciate his food here. Packed with delicious nutritious meals, snacks and staples, plus inspirational interviews with other long-distance runners. AJ Buy it for: someone who might like encouragement to exercise Midnight Chicken and Other Recipes Worth Living For By Ella Risbridger A mix of recipes, love story and memoir, Midnight Chicken is powered by Risbridger\u2019s depression and her boyfriend\u2019s death from cancer, just as she was finishing this book. \u201cI wrote it in part to keep our world alive even if he couldn\u2019t be,\u201d she says of a collection that neatly explains how cooking knits itself into the day-to-day business of living. GG Buy it for: comfort (and the recipe for midnight chicken itself) Hungry By Jeff Gordinier Few people have spent as much time with Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, the chef behind Copenhagen\u2019s Noma, as Gordinier, food editor of US Esquire . Here he tags along during a time of great change, Redzepi temporarily decamping to Mexico then revolutionising his approach to cooking all over again when opening Noma 2.0. Along the way, Gordinier locates what makes the world\u2019s greatest cook tick. First there\u2019s his outsider status as an immigrant from Macedonia. Then there\u2019s his almost pathological curiosity, shared by the international crew of talent he gathers around him, all bound together by his ethos: \u201ckeep moving\u201d. GG Buy it for: anyone who dreams big in the kitchen East By Meera Sodha One hundred and twenty fantastic dishes from purple sprouting broccoli pad thai to paneer, tomato and kale saag, plus lots of ways to make tofu taste good. Some recipes are from Sodha\u2019s vegan column in the Guardian, others, new. Traversing not just the culinary domain of her own heritage, Sodha finds inspiration in vegan dishes from other parts of Asia too, describing the restrictions of her column as a \u201ccatalyst for creativity\u201d.

      "body": "<p>In the Pixar film Inside Out, the emotions of an 11-year-old girl are personified as perky Joy, petulant Disgust and hulking Anger. Sadness \u2013 voiced by The American Office\u2019s Phyllis Smith \u2013 is, predictably, a downer with a deep side-parting and a chunky knit. Amy Poehler\u2019s Joy can hardly stand to be around her, like a colleague you would time your trips to the tea point to avoid.</p> <p>But the takeaway of the 2015 film \u2013 said by Variety to \u201cfor ever change the way people think about the way people think\u201d \u2013 was that both emotions were necessary, and Sadness was as valid a part of life as Joy. Now there is a case for not only accepting Sadness, as in Inside Out \u2013 but embodying her, too. Researchers from Hong Kong and Texas recently found that individuals asked to think of their sadness as a person reported feeling less sad afterwards, a result they attributed to the increased distance perceived between the self and the emotion.</p> <p>Study participants were asked to imagine Sadness\u2019s personality, appearance, conversational style and how they might interact with them. In doing so, the idea was they would make it separate and less relevant to them. \u201cThe underlying mechanics of it is detachment \u2013 when they think about sadness as a person, it\u2019s like they are endowing independence to the emotion,\u201d says Li Yang, a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin and corresponding author of the <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1137\" title=\"\">paper</a>, published in September in the Journal of Consumer Psychology. \u201cThey feel detached from it, and that\u2019s why they would feel less sad afterwards.\u201d</p> <p>Sadness is well established by research as leading people to focus on short-term and often indulgent rewards. By picturing their sadness with human traits and characteristics, study participants ameliorated its effect and were then more likely to display self-control. Such anthropomorphic thinking was even shown to be an effective advance strategy, preparing consumers to choose a healthier (or more practical) option.</p> <p>\u201cWe think about it as a new way to regulate your emotions,\u201d says Yang. There are obvious limitations to the study, she says \u2013 researchers investigated the short-term effects of anthropomorphic thinking on only sadness and its opposite emotion. Picturing happiness as a person also diluted its effect, suggesting the strategy could backfire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c04724b017a8b3779ebf43827253251907732fbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c04724b017a8b3779ebf43827253251907732fbf/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018By picturing their sadness with human traits, people were more likely to display better self-control.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018By picturing their sadness with human traits, people were more likely to display better self-control.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disney/Pixar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is also not known whether it would be as effective in detaching from other negative emotions, such as guilt or embarrassment, which are more inherently self-involved, says Yang. Depression, too, is far more complex than just sadness.</p> <p>But many of us could benefit from better harnessing the power of the mind over emotions, as established time and again by research into emotional regulation. Even a simple change in language can help change your perspective.</p> <p>Dr Ozlem Ayduk, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, says 20 years of research has shown self-distancing to be important in minimising distress caused by negative memories or experiences. In early studies asking participants to assume the position of an observer, replaying \u201cthe scene in their mind\u2019s eye, as if they were a fly on the wall\u201d, was consistently linked to a lower emotional response \u2013 be that sadness, anxiety, anger or even anticipated instances of them in the future. Ayduk\u2019s studies have shown such distancing to be effective whether imposed in study conditions or reached for spontaneously, and over a variety of different stress-inducing situations \u2013 from being called on to speak in public, to even thinking about the Ebola crisis. Moreover, the benefits seem to persist over time.</p> <p>It works by creating an opportunity to process a difficult event, and reframe its meaning on the basis of its facts alone. \u201cThe problem, when we are in our own egocentric mode, is that we are feeling anxious, angry or sad and we can\u2019t see it any other way, partly because of those emotions,\u201d says Ayduk. \u201cAs you turn down the emotions, different perspectives become available \u2013 and as different perspectives become available, the emotions turn down.\u201d</p> <p>More recently, in looking for more techniques for emotional regulation, Ayduk and other researchers have turned their attention to internal monologue. In attempting to process and move on from difficult emotions or experiences, it is accepted that analysing them yourself can be helpful. But Ayduk says this can easily become unconstructive if it tips into rumination, a risk factor for depression and anxiety, that potentially increases their impact.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-04047-3\" title=\"\">study</a> published in the journal Nature in 2017, Ayduk and her collaborators found that switching your self-talk from first person to third person may be helpful in managing emotions during stressful times. The example they gave was a man upset about being dumped: he was found to be less emotionally reactive when he reflected on his feelings in the third person (\u201cWhy is John upset?\u201d) than when he addressed himself directly (\u201cWhy am I upset?\u201d)</p> <p>Robust effects were recorded in study participants responding to distressing imagery and personal challenges. \u201cWe use names and third- and second-person pronouns to refer exclusively to other people, so, by making that switch in language as we reflect about ourselves, we could trick our minds to think about ourselves as if we are other people,\u201d says Ayduk.</p> <p>Talking about yourself to yourself as you would a friend is a common recommendation of therapists to highlight how hard we can be on ourselves, often without even realising it. But the science of self-distancing is more involved than our simply being kinder about others than we are about ourselves, says Ayduk.</p> <p>\u201cMost of us have experienced this. We seem to reason perfectly well about other people\u2019s problems; it\u2019s our own that we can\u2019t reason through, and the reason for that is ourselves and our egos are in the middle of the situation \u2013 we feel threatened, we have biases, we have defensive reactions.\u201d</p> <p>A simple switch in pronouns manipulates the mind into creating psychological distance, allowing us to bypass some of those counterproductive mechanisms and to reason more objectively and perhaps come to terms with our emotions. The strength of the strategy lies in its relative simplicity, says Ayduk, especially compared with visualising yourself from a distance: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to do because it\u2019s something we\u2019re so used to doing. Yes, you can pretend to be a fly on the wall, but it\u2019s easier to have a parallel, internal monologue that you can modify.\u201d</p> <p>Ayduk\u2019s collaborator Dr Jason Moser, an associate professor of psychology at Michigan State University and lead author on the 2017 study, notes that regulating your emotions is often thought of as a feat of self-control, as mindfulness and positive thinking take time and discipline to master.</p> <p>But using the third person has been shown to take no more toll on the brain\u2019s activity than using the first person, suggesting it could be a \u201crelatively effortless\u201d and effective means of managing your emotional response on the spot. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that it can help people manage their social anxiety or performance anxiety before giving a speech, before interacting with people they\u2019ve never met before,\u201d says Moser.</p> <p>As a nervous flyer, Moser reaches for third-person self-talk himself: \u201cI just start talking to myself: \u2018Jason really hates turbulence. Why is Jason so worried about turbulence? Jason is worried the plane is going to crash.\u2019 Then, naturally, I start giving myself advice as I would another person on the plane struggling with flight anxiety, such as: \u2018Air travel is the safest form of travel; everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Whether self-talk has a role in treating clinical depression, anxiety and other mental health issues is \u201cthe million-dollar question\u201d, says Moser. It is currently being researched. As a clinical therapist by training, he is aware of the challenges \u2013 but the preliminary data as well as the literature already amassed suggests there is huge potential.</p> <p>\u201cThe data all seems to point to the same bottom line: this is something you can give to people that they can use for processing memories from the past, things in the moment, as well as anticipating stressful situations in the future. That basically covers the gamut of things people are struggling with.\u201d</p> <p>Elle intends to try it.</p>",

Chelsea entertain Manchester City at Kingsmeadow with both acutely aware of the implications a positive result could have on their season.

But Nick Cushing\u2019s side also have their eyes on the prize.</p> <p>Emma Hayes\u2019s side are made of stern stuff; they are unbeaten and have dropped just two points all season. Chelsea should be fresh, too. They have not played since dispatching Birmingham 6-0 a fortnight ago, with Bethany England turning in another fine performance. England has flourished at Chelsea since returning from a two-year loan at Liverpool and her form has not gone unnoticed, with the forward included in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/dec/03/the-100-best-female-footballers-in-the-world-2019\"><em>Guardian\u2019s</em> top 100 female footballers</a> for 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think that a lass from Barnsley is now deemed one of the best in the world for football.

We fell asleep, we were ball-watching. But I spoke to Beth at half-time about staying in the game because I felt chances were going to come. She is having a wonderful season. I thought Drew [Spence] made a big difference when she came on and Maren did great. Ellie Roebuck was their best player today, that it was their goalkeeper shows how much we created.\u201d Another full-time: Manchester United 3-1 Everton. Casey Stoney\u2019s side came from behind to secure victory courtesy of a Lauren James double and a Katie Zelem penalty. All in all, not a good weekend for Manchester City. Some Chelsea reaction. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the prettiest goal I have scored but probably one of the most important ones,\u201d says a jubilant matchwinner Maren Mjelde. \u201cIt is a massive win for us. We have struggled with City in the league. I had never won against them so I think it was really important to come back, I think that shows the togetherness and quality in this team \u2013 we never give up. We are going to go unbeaten for a long time I think.\u201d One Step Beyond plays out at the final whistle as Emma Hayes\u2019s side soar top of the Women\u2019s Super League \u2013 for an hour or so at least; Arsenal take on Reading in half an hour. Chelsea\u2019s unbeaten streak goes on after goals by Bethany England and Maren Mjelde complete a comeback victory at Kingsmeadow to down Manchester City. It was a nervy finish, with a City corner leading to a goalmouth scramble in the final minute of second-half stoppage-time. A hammer blow for City\u2019s title hopes. 90+2 min: It\u2019s powered in but cleared by Chelsea. 90+2 min: Campbell will launch in a long throw ... 90 min: Time is ticking for City. There will be three added minutes. 86 min: Jess Carter replaces Ramona Bachmann. 84 min: Campbell replaces Demi Stokes. City will hope to get an opportunity to unleash Campbell\u2019s notorious long throw. 83 min: A seething City side hop on to the front foot and Stanway\u2019s shot from the edge of the box cannons off Eriksson \u2013 but Berger gathers. Believe it or not City have conceded more goals this afternoon than they had in their previous eight matches. Some turnaround at Kingsmeadow. Roebuck punches clear a cross as far as England, who diverts the ball goalwards and Maren Mjelde gives it a helping hand, smashing home. A gap of just 155 seconds between those two goals and what a couple of minutes for Emma Hayes\u2019s Chelsea, who are set to leapfrog City. Roebuck is finally beaten. Beth England pokes home the rebound after Ji\u2019s shot from the edge of the box was palmed into the path of the striker by the City goalkeeper. That\u2019s only the second goal City have conceded in the league this season. 76 min: Mjelde rolls the ball into Ji on halfway, with the South Korea midfielder urgently trying to make something happen. Chelsea\u2019s unbeaten run is under threat \u2013 they have not lost a league game since January. 75 min: .. straight into the City wall. 74 min: Stanway fouls Sophie Ingle on the edge of the box and Chelsea win a free-kick 25 yards from goal. It\u2019s in a promising position, fairly centrally. Ji is stood over it ... 72 min: Emma Hayes shuffles the Chelsea pack as Drew Spence replaces Reiten. They are certainly pushing for an equaliser. 69 min: Brilliant save by Ellie Roebuck denies Bachmann! The City defence backs off and off and off, until they can retreat no more and Roebuck sprawls to her left to keep out Bachmann\u2019s curling effort. A fine stop, moments after Walsh probed in search of a second for City. The 20-year-old Roebuck has had a stormer in goal. 66 min: Ji surges into the box and her trickery enables the Chelsea midfielder to wriggle into a yard of space but City throw bodies on the line, with Steph Houghton making a wonderful last-ditch challenge. Chelsea are desperate to level things up. Can they? 65 min: Advantage Manchester City, then. Remember Nick Cushing\u2019s side have conceded just a single goal all season. Work to do for Chelsea. 61 min: Bethany England makes something out of nothing, heading at goal \u2013 but it is tame and easy for Roebuck to gather. A sumptuous finish. City win the ball high upfield and Caroline Weir steers a nonchalant volley back across goal and into the corner beyond Berger. Weir peeled off towards the back post to meet Walsh\u2019s cross after the City midfielder pickpocketed Ramona Bachmann following a corner. A beautiful strike and City are heading three points clear at the top, for a couple of hours at least; leaders Arsenal take on Reading a little later. 57 min: Andersson tries to centre the ball but the Swede\u2019s mammoth cross, with the help of a swirling wind, almost ends up endangering Ellie Roebuck\u2019s goal. A bit of housekeeping: there are almost 3,500 at Kingsmeadow this afternoon. 55 min: Nick Cushing can be heard bellowing at his City players, urging them to stay alert. They have controlled large spells but have drifted off at key moments, allowing Mjelde and then Ji to hit the woodwork. Chelsea are knocking on the door, with Ji running the show in midfield. Ji has just nicked the ball off Walsh on halfway to kickstart another move. 53 min: Ji rattles a post! Roebuck was beaten, with the ball bouncing awkwardly en route to smacking the woodwork but, for the second time this afternoon, City get away with one. Mjelde hit the crossbar at the end of the first half and now Ji has left another blemish on the woodwork. The South 50 min: Reiten surges downfield, this time through the middle but City stand off and eventually the Chelsea forward runs into trouble. England had dragged wide and Reiten ran out of room to manoeuvre. City get the chance to rebuild and pop it about neatly across the back. 47 min: Millie Bright does superbly to halt a City attack in one breath and kickstart a Chelsea counterattack in another. Brilliant stuff, with Bachmann taking over the baton before Stokes intervenes. Both of these teams have been scoring goals for fun but there have been few clear-cut chances, with that that flurry at the end of the first half the best opening. 46 min: Promising start by Chelsea, who raid down the right through Reiten \u2013 that\u2019s got a ring to it. Reiten drives down the flank before cueing the ball back for England, but the forward is crowded out. City under pressure. 46 min: Chelsea get the second half started. Goalless at the break. 45+3 min: Maren Mjelde rattles the crossbar from 25 yards! The Chelsea defender takes aim with minimal backlift and smacks the woodwork. A lax City get off the hook twice in a matter of seconds. 45+2 min: Roebuck makes a strong save to deny England! City get sloppy approaching the interval and Roebuck stands firm. 45 min: Ji gradually gets back to her feet but she is moving a little gingerly. There will be three added minutes at Kingsmeadow. 44 min: Hemp clatters Ji on halfway. That\u2019s a poor tackle, so much so that it earns the Manchester City teenager a booking. No complaints. 43 min: Bachmann has a pop at goal. But it\u2019s easy for Roebuck to gather. Chelsea have tried to up the ante, as Hayes demanded but they have struggled to really hurt City. Roebuck has only had one true save to make. The same can be said for Berger down the other end. 41 min: Bachmann and Ji stretch City with a pulsating break \u2013 but the final ball deflates another Chelsea move. Ji got her legs in a muddle, allowing City to intercept and take the sting out of that attack. 38 min: Steph Houghton is down with what looks like a shin injury. The City captain is receiving treatment from the physios. That break in play gives City a breather after coming under the cosh in the last moments. 37 min: It\u2019s blowing a gale and City freeze in defence, almost allowing Chelsea to prod in from close range. A period of concerted pressure for Nick Cushing\u2019s side to cope with. Roebuck is keeping busy in goal. 35 min: Big save by Roebuck! Chelsea carve City open, with Bachmann\u2019s backheel the catalyst for a sweeping move that culminates with Bethany England cutting inside Demi Stokes before testing Roebuck. England piled a shot at goal but failed to find a corner. City survive but Chelsea win a corner ... 33 min: Emma Hayes can be heard barking instructions from the touchline. In short she wants her Chelsea side to press City higher and, in effect, into trouble. City have had it all their own way since an unflattering opening period. Janine Beckie is causing problems down the Chelsea left. 31 min: Scott pings a cross towards the back post in search of Lauren Hemp. The ball lures Berger miles out of her goal but a combination of the Chelsea goalkeeper and the defender Mjelde end up scaring City off. But not for long as Stokes rebuilds down the left, though City again fail to test Berger. 29 min: Chelsea break in numbers on the edge of the area, with Cuthbert nudging the ball into the path of Bethany England. But England makes a meal of things and ends up surrendering possession on the edge of the City 18-yard box. A let-off for the visitors, because Chelsea had built a promising four v three scenario. 27 min: A hit-and-hope effort by Wullaert is easily gathered by Berger. Emma Hayes is barking her Chelsea team on. They have gone a little flat in the last 10 minutes or so. City seem quietly confident. 25 min: Hemp fizzes a low cross into the front post but Ellen White cannot trap possession. The ball ends up bobbling away from danger before Hemp surges back down the left. In the end Maren Mjelde stands firm. 22 min: Ji is clipped by Wullaert. Chelsea earn a free-kick 35 yards from goal but Cuthbert\u2019s delivery is poor, with her daisycutter falling straight into the lap of a City defender. Ji has been the catalyst for all of Chelsea\u2019s good work but she needs some help from Bachmann, England and co. 20 min: Berger releases Bethany England on halfway, with the forward coming deep to collect the ball. England has been lively for Chelsea of late but very quiet so far this afternoon. But the move breaks down and back come Manchester City, with Wullaert dragging wide. 18 min: That whiff of goal has given City something to build on. Beckie surges down the right flank and Andersson concedes another corner ... 16 min: Caroline Weir\u2019s corner is unconvincingly cleared, allowing the City midfielder to immediately recycle possession. Another low cross is powered into the front post, causing havoc for the Chelsea back line. Lauren Hemp swivels and gets a snapshot away at goal but it\u2019s wayward, much to Ellen White\u2019s frustration. That\u2019s City best \u2013 and only opening yet. 15 min: Beckie earns City a first corner ... 14 min: Everything is going through Ji So-yun, the South Korea captain. Things open up for the Chelsea playmaker and she is invited to shoot but in the end her strike is a fairly routine one for Roebuck to deal with. 13 min: It is one-way traffic, with Chelsea in the ascendancy without being able to hurt City. Elsewhere, plenty of goals between Manchester United and Everton, with Casey Stoney\u2019s side 2-1 up after 11 minutes. 8 min: Emma Hayes will be delighted with this start. Chelsea are very much on the front foot, with Ramona Bachmann, a willing runner, causing problems. Stokes is chasing her tail before Ji takes hold and stabs an effort wide. 6 min: Bachmann v Houghton is developing into an intriguing battle. The Chelsea forward is edging it at present. A Chelsea free-kick is floated in by Cuthbert but it is cleared by the returning Jill Scott, an evergreen presence in the heart of midfield. 4 min: Bright plays in Cuthbert. Offside. 3 min: Nick Cushing has come up against Chelsea 11 times as a manager, losing just the once. An encouraging record for the Manchester City boss. 2 min: Ji probes and City concede a corner, with Bonner blocking a shot by Cuthbert. Reiten delivers but the offside flag is raised. 1 min: A low-key start at Kingsmeadow, with Chelsea getting a feel for things, with Ji happy to collect the ball from deep. Man City get things started. The Liquidator rings around Kingsmeadow \u2013 lovely stuff. It\u2019s a lovely, bright and breezy day in southwest London. Here we go ... Some pre-match chat. Emma Hayes says her Chelsea side are champing at the bit. \u201cWe have had a good training week and sometimes you don\u2019t get the opportunity to do as much in training as you\u2019d like because you\u2019re recovering but we\u2019re certainly prepared for the game,\u201d she says. Her opposite number, Nick Cushing, says it is far too early to place too much significance on the outcome of this match. But, then the Manchester City manager adds: \u201cWhen you play the head-to-heads, they have played a part in who has gone on to win the title. We want to make sure we play well.\u201d Jill Scott is back in for City. \u201cShe\u2019s so competitive and she has played such a huge part in our success over the past six seasons, it is essential we go into the big games with players like her,\u201d Cushing says. \u201cYou will have a winding road as a striker,\u201d explains the former Chelsea striker Eni Aluko. \u201cA big signing like Sam Kerr does bring pressure. Beth [England] went to Liverpool, she proved herself and now she is one of the leading strikers in the league. I\u2019m sure Beth is not going to be really bothered by Sam Kerr. For someone like Fran [Kirby] I think that is where now it\u2019s that push and it should be a kick up the backside as well.\u201d Heh, tell us something we don\u2019t know: The top 100 female players: Chelsea defender Maren Mjelde says they come into this one with a spring in their step. The past four meetings between the sides have ended with honours even and another cagey game is likely. I feel like teams don\u2019t really like coming to Kingsmeadow. It is of course one of the biggest games, playing against City is always a good challenge for us and it\u2019s good to have them at home before Christmas. The week before Everton we had three games. We have been training well this week, we\u2019ve saved the legs and had a great week of training. It\u2019s not easy to predict what is going to happen because it\u2019s two teams that want to win to make the distance between the teams bigger. It\u2019s really tight at the top of the league, we need to prepare well for them and they are going to be doing the same. I think it will be the team that is having the best day on Sunday that will win but I\u2019m sure that we have enough qualities to win against them. Chelsea: Berger; Bright, Ingle, Cuthbert, Eriksson, Mjelde, Bachmann, Andersson, Reiten, Ji, England Subs: Telford, Blundell, Carter, Cooper, Spence, Fleming, Murphy Manchester City: Roebuck, Beckie, Houghton, Bonner, Stokes, Walsh, Weir, Scott, Hemp, White, Wullaert Subs: Benameur, Campbell, Coombs, Stanway, Geum-Min, Fidalgo This is a meeting between title contenders and a test of mettle. Chelsea entertain Manchester City at Kingsmeadow with both acutely aware of the implications a positive result could have on their season. City or Chelsea could finish the weekend top of the table if leaders Arsenal slip up at Reading and Chelsea, who also have a game in hand, are determined to regain the league title. But Nick Cushing\u2019s side also have their eyes on the prize. Emma Hayes\u2019s side are made of stern stuff; they are unbeaten and have dropped just two points all season. Chelsea should be fresh, too. They have not played since dispatching Birmingham 6-0 a fortnight ago, with Bethany England turning in another fine performance. England has flourished at Chelsea since returning from a two-year loan at Liverpool and her form has not gone unnoticed, with the forward included in the Guardian\u2019s top 100 female footballers for 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think that a lass from Barnsley is now deemed one of the best in the world for football. It\u2019s a bit surreal really,\u201d England said. Kick-off: 12pm (GMT)",

      "body": "<p>Lawyers representing Jeremy Bamber, who is serving a whole life sentence for killing his adoptive parents, sister and her six-year-old twin boys in 1985, have launched a high court challenge to the Crown Prosecution Service for its failure to disclose evidence they say would undermine the safety of his conviction.</p> <p>The statement of facts and grounds, lodged at the high court on Friday, maintains that the CPS has refused to follow directions made by the court of appeal in 2002 to disclose the sought-after material. It also accuses the CPS of rejecting a report by an eminent ballistics expert appointed by Bamber, without instructing its own expert to challenge the claims.</p> <p>During the night of 6-7 August 1985, Nevill and June Bamber were shot and killed inside their Essex farmhouse, along with their adoptive daughter, Sheila Caffell, and Sheila\u2019s six-year-old twin sons, Daniel and Nicholas Caffell. Bamber, then 24, had phoned the police to say Nevill had phoned him, saying his sister, Sheila, had \u201cgone crazy and has the gun\u201d.</p> <p>Initially, police believed that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned the gun on herself. But, on 10 August, after the police ended their examination of the crime scene, a relative of Nevill and June Bamber, David Boutflour, found a silencer in the gun cupboard of the farmhouse. It was later said to contain blood belonging to Sheila Caffell<strong>.</strong></p> <p>On 7 September 1985, Jeremy Bamber\u2019s ex-girlfriend told police Bamber had discussed killing his family with her and that he was involved. On 29 September 1985, Bamber was charged with the murders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf6dd5add8cb44bdc8b3ab9dbeb483affd6ecdb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf6dd5add8cb44bdc8b3ab9dbeb483affd6ecdb8/0_1_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Bamber being taken to jail after being convicted of killing five members of his family\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Bamber being taken to jail after being convicted of killing five members of his family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trinity Mirror / Mirrorpix / Ala/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The silencer featured heavily at the trial at Chelmsford crown court the following year with the prosecution contending it was attached to the rifle during the killings. If true, that would have made the rifle too long for Caffell to have shot herself. The trial judge, in his summing up, told the jury: \u201cOn the evidence of the silencer alone you may find Mr Bamber guilty.\u201d</p> <p>After the jury were sent out to reach a verdict, they returned and asked the judge for clarification on the silencer and blood evidence. The judge said it contained only the blood of Sheila Caffell. Seventeen minutes later, they returned and convicted Bamber by a 10 to two majority.</p> <p>But a week before the trial, the head of biology at Huntingdon Forensic Science Laboratories wrote to Essex police in a letter seen by the Guardian last year, saying the blood on the silencer \u201ccould have come from Sheila Caffell or Robert Boutflour\u201d, another relative. That letter was not disclosed to the defence.</p> <p>Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/21/scientists-report-casts-doubt-on-jeremy-bamber-trial-evidence\">the Guardian reported on a letter</a> sent to Bamber\u2019s lawyers from the then head of special crime at the CPS on this issue. It stated that while he did not believe there was evidence of a second silencer, if any emerged it \u201cwould significantly undermine the case against JB [Jeremy Bamber] and any material supporting such a possibility would plainly be material which casts doubt on the safety of the conviction.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year a peer-reviewed report compiled by Phillip Boyce, a ballistics expert at Forensic Equity Ltd, was sent to the CPS suggesting there had been more than one silencer. Boyce, who has advised governments and the United Nations on ballistics, concluded that, based on differing groove patterns, sizes and exhibit numbers, \u201cat least two sound moderators had been examined in this case\u201d.<strong> </strong>Boyce believes both silencers contain blood that could belong to either Caffell or Robert Boutflour.

      "bodyText": "Lawyers representing Jeremy Bamber, who is serving a whole life sentence for killing his adoptive parents, sister and her six-year-old twin boys in 1985, have launched a high court challenge to the Crown Prosecution Service for its failure to disclose evidence they say would undermine the safety of his conviction. The statement of facts and grounds, lodged at the high court on Friday, maintains that the CPS has refused to follow directions made by the court of appeal in 2002 to disclose the sought-after material. It also accuses the CPS of rejecting a report by an eminent ballistics expert appointed by Bamber, without instructing its own expert to challenge the claims. During the night of 6-7 August 1985, Nevill and June Bamber were shot and killed inside their Essex farmhouse, along with their adoptive daughter, Sheila Caffell, and Sheila\u2019s six-year-old twin sons, Daniel and Nicholas Caffell. Bamber, then 24, had phoned the police to say Nevill had phoned him, saying his sister, Sheila, had \u201cgone crazy and has the gun\u201d. Initially, police believed that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned the gun on herself. But, on 10 August, after the police ended their examination of the crime scene, a relative of Nevill and June Bamber, David Boutflour, found a silencer in the gun cupboard of the farmhouse. It was later said to contain blood belonging to Sheila Caffell. On 7 September 1985, Jeremy Bamber\u2019s ex-girlfriend told police Bamber had discussed killing his family with her and that he was involved. On 29 September 1985, Bamber was charged with the murders. The silencer featured heavily at the trial at Chelmsford crown court the following year with the prosecution contending it was attached to the rifle during the killings. If true, that would have made the rifle too long for Caffell to have shot herself. The trial judge, in his summing up, told the jury: \u201cOn the evidence of the silencer alone you may find Mr Bamber guilty.\u201d After the jury were sent out to reach a verdict, they returned and asked the judge for clarification on the silencer and blood evidence. The judge said it contained only the blood of Sheila Caffell. Seventeen minutes later, they returned and convicted Bamber by a 10 to two majority. But a week before the trial, the head of biology at Huntingdon Forensic Science Laboratories wrote to Essex police in a letter seen by the Guardian last year, saying the blood on the silencer \u201ccould have come from Sheila Caffell or Robert Boutflour\u201d, another relative. That letter was not disclosed to the defence. Last year, the Guardian reported on a letter sent to Bamber\u2019s lawyers from the then head of special crime at the CPS on this issue. It stated that while he did not believe there was evidence of a second silencer, if any emerged it \u201cwould significantly undermine the case against JB [Jeremy Bamber] and any material supporting such a possibility would plainly be material which casts doubt on the safety of the conviction.\u201d Earlier this year a peer-reviewed report compiled by Phillip Boyce, a ballistics expert at Forensic Equity Ltd, was sent to the CPS suggesting there had been more than one silencer. Boyce, who has advised governments and the United Nations on ballistics, concluded that, based on differing groove patterns, sizes and exhibit numbers, \u201cat least two sound moderators had been examined in this case\u201d. Boyce believes both silencers contain blood that could belong to either Caffell or Robert Boutflour. The CPS has dismissed his findings, without employing its own expert to study his report, as is the protocol. Last year, the then director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, published a revised version of CPS disclosure manual. Saunders concluded: \u201cTo maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system, it is essential that the relevant disclosure regime is complied with in every case and all duties performed to a high standard. I hope this manual will continue to offer practical guidance to practitioners and give the lay reader a degree of reassurance that the prosecution team is fully committed to meeting its obligations in this hugely important area.\u201d Speaking from Wakefield prison, Bamber said his requests for disclosure had been ignored for almost 35 years, despite court orders issued in 2002 during his only full appeal that directed complete disclosure to be made. \u201cWe are now in a position to show exactly what has been withheld, which amounts to thousands of key files and documents pertaining to, not just the forensic examination of two silencers, but also to my innocence. This repeated non\u2013disclosure means that the truth remains unknown, as the evidence that gives my case clarity still remains hidden,\u201d he said. Mark Newby, a solicitor advocate from QualitySolicitors Jordans, which represents Bamber, said: \u201cIt is disappointing that the CPS has not agreed to provide material that is needed by an independent expert to support the overwhelming inference that a second silencer was examined during the police and forensic science service investigations.

Another report from Vulture flagged Union\u2019s frustrations after producers allegedly discouraged judges from supporting a young black rapper on the grounds that they needed to choose an act \u201cthat America can get behind\u201d. Hough, the other AGT judge leaving this season, said she had a \u201cwonderful time\u201d on the show. NBC and Fremantle, the show\u2019s production company, responded in a statement at the time saying, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent has a long history of inclusivity and diversity in both our talent and the acts championed by the show. The judging and host line-up has been regularly refreshed over the years and that is one of the reasons for AGT\u2019s enduring popularity.\u201d This week NBC and Fremantle met with Union for a five-hour \u201cfact-finding meeting\u201d. Both parties deemed that first conversation \u201cproductive\u201d, and the network has announced its intention to launch a deeper investigation into the reported incidents. NBC said in a statement that the \u201cinitial conversation was candid and productive. While there will be a further investigation to get a deeper understanding of the facts, we are working with Gabrielle to come to a positive resolution.\u201d And Union tweeted approvingly that \u201cI was able to, again, express my unfiltered truth.\u201d That NBC is taking her complaints so seriously is a belated sign that the network has realised the impact of the repeated scandals and a testament, perhaps, to the power of whistleblowers. That\u2019s according to Farrow in an appearance this week on The View, a popular daytime show on rival network ABC. \u201cIt is very clear that source after source is saying there is a systemic cultural problem with this kind of toxicity at NBC,\u201d Farrow said. \u201cI think we\u2019re seeing the consequences of what happens when you sweep these kinds of problems under the rug.\u201d They are consequences Farrow would know something about. In his bestselling Catch and Kill, Farrow alleged that disgraced mogul Weinstein worked every connection he had at the network to achieve his desired effect: NBC ordered a stop to Farrow\u2019s reporting. What\u2019s more, Farrow states specifically that NBC attempted to suppress his reporting after Weinstein threatened to reveal sexual misconduct allegations against the network\u2019s former star host, Lauer. NBC has repeatedly denied attempting to stop Farrow\u2019s reporting, arguing the allegations put forth in his book \u201cpaint a fundamentally untrue picture\u201d. \u201cWe have no secrets and nothing to hide,\u201d the NBC News president, Noah Oppenheim, told staffers in an October memo. \u201cThere is no evidence of any reports of Lauer\u2019s misconduct before his firing, no settlements, no \u2018hush money\u2019.\u201d But Farrow has some very public supporters at the network. Chris Hayes a host on MSNBC, NBC\u2019s cable network, has used his own airtime to support Farrow\u2019s reporting and express his consternation at how his employer had handled Farrow\u2019s early work on Weinstein. Rachel Maddow has also addressed the issue on her own show, calling for an independent investigation of the network\u2019s conduct. But in another memo to staff sent around that time, the NBC News chairman, Andy Lack, sounded notes similar to Oppenheim\u2019s rebuttal. \u201cAfter seven months, without one victim or witness on the record, he simply didn\u2019t have a story that met our standard for broadcast nor that of any major news organization. Not willing to accept that standard and not wanting to get beaten by the New York Times, he asked to take his story to an outlet he claimed was ready to publish right away. Reluctantly, we allowed him to go ahead.\u201d Less than two months later Farrow published a Pulitzer prize-winning story in the New Yorker that Lack in his memo said \u201cbore little resemblance to the reporting he had while at NBC News\u201d. In his book, Farrow had reported former NBC news employee Brooke Nevils\u2019 allegation that Lauer had anally raped her at the Sochi Olympics. And Lack, in his memo, also contested the notion that NBC had ever been aware of complaints about Lauer\u2019s conduct prior to Nevils\u2019 allegation. The NBC legal team\u2019s \u201cexhaustive investigation\u201d of records and interviews of staff had \u201cuncovered no claims or settlements associated with allegations of inappropriate conduct by Lauer before he was fired,\u201dhe wrote Lauer, who would go on to be fired in 2017 following multiple sexual misconduct allegations, confirmed he had a relationship with the woman in question but maintains it was \u201ccompletely consensual\u201d and vehemently denies all allegations of rape and coercive conduct as \u201ccategorically false\u201d. But Farrow asserts that in fact the network paid out multiple settlement agreements to Lauer\u2019s accusers in the years leading up to the complaint. Nor is he alone. In interviews last year, a dozen current and former NBC staffers told the Washington Post they had been sexually harassed while working at NBC but chose not to report it, and three women said they had been harassed by Lauer specifically. Lauer responded: \u201cI fully acknowledge that I acted inappropriately as a husband, father and principal at NBC. However, I want to make it perfectly clear that any allegations or reports of coercive, aggressive or abusive actions on my part, at any time, are absolutely false.\u201d Even before revelations about Lauer and Weinstein became public, NBC was already facing scrutiny for failing to run the Access Hollywood tape in which Donald Trump brags about sexually assaulting women. The tape was later leaked to the Washington Post, whose reporter went on to win a Pulitzer prize. That NBC will have an independent investigator look into the latest dust-up with Union shows they are perhaps taking these issues more seriously. But after the meeting this week with Union, her lawyer Bryan Freedman said he was still \u201cwaiting to see the next steps on whether NBC is going to make sure that there are real changes\u201d afoot. Contacted Friday afternoon by the Guardian, he added his team had \u201cnothing to update at this time.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>After being subjected to a 20-minute audio-visual barrage of near constant mansplaining and manspreading, Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge finally got to ask a question without being talked over or interrupted. A month ago, she had asked Boris Johnson to name the naughtiest thing he had ever done. Back then, the prime minister had asked for more time to think about it as he was so spoiled for choice. So now he had a chance to review his previous, perhaps he would like to come clean?</p> \n<p>Boris smirked, tugged nervously at his pre-tousled hair and spread his thighs even wider apart. Both knees were now only visible in a wide-angle shot. \u201cUm ... er \u2026\u201d he babbled incoherently, playing for time that he didn\u2019t have. In desperation, he turned around and begged his off-camera advisers to help him out. They all tried to avoid catching his eye. Where to start? Finally inspiration came to him. There may have been one or two occasions on which he had ridden his bicycle on the pavement. Something he deeply regretted and would be punishable with a whole life sentence under a new Conservative law and order crackdown.</p> \n<p>\u201cCycling on a pavement?\u201d a startled Ridge repeated. Did the prime minister really think that was a more serious offence than conspiring to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/journalist-stuart-collier-boris-johnson-phone-call-darius-guppy-demands-apology\">a journalist beaten up</a>?

Or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/uk-supreme-court-ruling-key-issues-behind-judges-decision-boris-johnson-suspension-parliament\">lying to the Queen</a>? Or wilfully inflicting a Brexit deal on the country in which even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/16/secret-boris-johnson-column-favoured-uk-remaining-in-eu\">he didn\u2019t believe</a>?

Or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/28/boris-johnson-jennifer-arcuri-loan-hacker-house-grant\">his curious relationship with Jennifer Arcuri</a>?</p> \n<p>And as these were just the misdemeanours that were a matter of public record, presumably he was more than happy to admit to them all. Clearly nothing in there to give a normally functioning lying sociopath a sleepless night. But who knew what else Boris might have tucked away in his back catalogue? The dodgy demos? The Dominic Raab basement tapes?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/06/lying-liar-lies-some-more-as-boris-johnson-braves-bbc-studio-for-debate\">Lying liar lies some more as Boris Johnson braves BBC studio for debate | John Crace</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Up till then it had been a standard interview for the prime minister. One in which his narcissism had been so out of control he had barely appeared to notice there was an interviewer in the same room as him. Sophy who?

This avoids \u2018\u201cwasting\u201d your vote on a party that cannot win the seat, and boosting the chances that the party you dislike most will lose.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ridge looked genuinely troubled at times. Not just by the fact that she and her viewers had yet again been gaslit by someone so clearly incapable of either empathy or talking in coherent sentences, but also by the probability that he would still be prime minister in four days\u2019 time. How was it possible a country could so fall from grace that it could elect as leader a man who would brazenly tell the lies everyone else was too ashamed to say out loud?</p> \n<p>How can we trust you, Ridge asked. Even before she had finished talking, Boris began on his routine patter. We could trust him precisely because everyone knew he was pathologically untrustworthy. Someone whose whole life had been a case study in betrayal. Of himself and others. The UK knew where it stood with him. He was the hollow man who would say whatever was needed to get him through the moment, even if he found himself contradicting himself 30 seconds later. A bloated, degraded figure without qualities on whom anyone was free to superimpose their own hopes and prejudices.</p> \n<p>We went through all the usual suspects. The 50,000 nurses that weren\u2019t 50,000. The 20,000 extra police that would leave things just a bit more crap than they were in 2010. Steve Barclay and all trade experts were idiots who didn\u2019t understand the first thing about the Northern Irish border. He had never been hostile to immigrants. It hadn\u2019t been him who had threatened the arrival of 5 million Turks during the referendum campaign. And so on and so on. It gets so tiring pointing out the same lies, day after day. But if you don\u2019t they eventually get accepted as truths.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re running out of time,\u201d said Ridge mercifully, as Boris continued to riff over her trying not to answer if he would resign if he didn\u2019t win a majority. Though he was disappointed not to have an opportunity to expand on his Sunday Times exclusive that once we had left the EU in January, the UK would have the biggest shag fest ever.</p> \n<p>This was the real Brexit dividend. A campaign that had always been close to his heart, and one that he would be proud to spearhead. He would lead the Great Impregnathon. He was even hoping some of it might be televised.

      "bodyText": "After being subjected to a 20-minute audio-visual barrage of near constant mansplaining and manspreading, Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge finally got to ask a question without being talked over or interrupted. A month ago, she had asked Boris Johnson to name the naughtiest thing he had ever done. Back then, the prime minister had asked for more time to think about it as he was so spoiled for choice. So now he had a chance to review his previous, perhaps he would like to come clean? Boris smirked, tugged nervously at his pre-tousled hair and spread his thighs even wider apart. Both knees were now only visible in a wide-angle shot. \u201cUm ... er \u2026\u201d he babbled incoherently, playing for time that he didn\u2019t have. In desperation, he turned around and begged his off-camera advisers to help him out. They all tried to avoid catching his eye. Where to start? Finally inspiration came to him. There may have been one or two occasions on which he had ridden his bicycle on the pavement. Something he deeply regretted and would be punishable with a whole life sentence under a new Conservative law and order crackdown. \u201cCycling on a pavement?\u201d a startled Ridge repeated. Did the prime minister really think that was a more serious offence than conspiring to get a journalist beaten up? Or undermining Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s hopes of freedom? Or being sacked for making up stories as a journalist? Or being sacked as a minister for lying to his party leader about his affair with Petronella Wyatt? Or lying to the Queen? Or wilfully inflicting a Brexit deal on the country in which even he didn\u2019t believe? Or refusing to take responsibility for numerous affairs and children? Or using racist and sexist language? Or his curious relationship with Jennifer Arcuri? And as these were just the misdemeanours that were a matter of public record, presumably he was more than happy to admit to them all. Clearly nothing in there to give a normally functioning lying sociopath a sleepless night. But who knew what else Boris might have tucked away in his back catalogue? The dodgy demos? The Dominic Raab basement tapes? Up till then it had been a standard interview for the prime minister. One in which his narcissism had been so out of control he had barely appeared to notice there was an interviewer in the same room as him. Sophy who? Give it half an hour and he wouldn\u2019t even be able to remember her name. Ridge looked genuinely troubled at times. Not just by the fact that she and her viewers had yet again been gaslit by someone so clearly incapable of either empathy or talking in coherent sentences, but also by the probability that he would still be prime minister in four days\u2019 time. How was it possible a country could so fall from grace that it could elect as leader a man who would brazenly tell the lies everyone else was too ashamed to say out loud? How can we trust you, Ridge asked. Even before she had finished talking, Boris began on his routine patter. We could trust him precisely because everyone knew he was pathologically untrustworthy. Someone whose whole life had been a case study in betrayal. Of himself and others. The UK knew where it stood with him. He was the hollow man who would say whatever was needed to get him through the moment, even if he found himself contradicting himself 30 seconds later. A bloated, degraded figure without qualities on whom anyone was free to superimpose their own hopes and prejudices. We went through all the usual suspects. The 50,000 nurses that weren\u2019t 50,000. The 20,000 extra police that would leave things just a bit more crap than they were in 2010. Steve Barclay and all trade experts were idiots who didn\u2019t understand the first thing about the Northern Irish border. He had never been hostile to immigrants. It hadn\u2019t been him who had threatened the arrival of 5 million Turks during the referendum campaign. And so on and so on. It gets so tiring pointing out the same lies, day after day. But if you don\u2019t they eventually get accepted as truths. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of time,\u201d said Ridge mercifully, as Boris continued to riff over her trying not to answer if he would resign if he didn\u2019t win a majority. Though he was disappointed not to have an opportunity to expand on his Sunday Times exclusive that once we had left the EU in January, the UK would have the biggest shag fest ever. This was the real Brexit dividend. A campaign that had always been close to his heart, and one that he would be proud to spearhead. He would lead the Great Impregnathon. He was even hoping some of it might be televised. O brave new world, that has such people in\u2019t!

      "body": "<p>What do you get when you cross Romeo and Juliet with Radiohead? The answer is in this ballet triple bill from Russian producer MuzArts. Much of the show\u2019s promotion has centred on a new collaboration between fashion designer Manfred Thierry Mugler and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/oct/13/wayne-mcgregor-interview\">choreographer Wayne McGregor</a>. That turns out to be a short, 15-minute duet, but it\u2019s quite the showstopper. The meat of the programme is the UK premiere of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/21/radio-and-juliet-perth-festival\">Edward Clug\u2019s Radio &amp; Juliet, from 2005</a>, where the Romanian choreographer reinvents Romeo and Juliet, setting it to the music of Thom Yorke and co.</p> <p>A band who embody the sound of turn-of-millennium anxiety might not be the obvious choice for an early modern romance, but given that Shakespeare\u2019s play is also a story of devastating gang warfare, Clug\u2019s dystopian vision starts to make sense. He drastically strips everything back \u2013 story, set (there isn\u2019t one), costumes, context, even the love. This leaves the music (from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/poll/2011/nov/18/greatest-radiohead-album\">Amnesiac, OK Computer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/nov/28/album-decade-radiohead-kid-a/\">Kid A</a>) to provide simmering unease, palpitating rhythm and a sense of processing towards doom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c1f5d48cbe63b3db1c460800763673c65bad90e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c1f5d48cbe63b3db1c460800763673c65bad90e/0_0_3224_2596/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katja Khaniukova in Radio &amp; Juliet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"805\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katja Khaniukova in Radio &amp; Juliet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is not a story about a connection between two people.

      "bodyText": "What do you get when you cross Romeo and Juliet with Radiohead? The answer is in this ballet triple bill from Russian producer MuzArts. Much of the show\u2019s promotion has centred on a new collaboration between fashion designer Manfred Thierry Mugler and choreographer Wayne McGregor. That turns out to be a short, 15-minute duet, but it\u2019s quite the showstopper. The meat of the programme is the UK premiere of Edward Clug\u2019s Radio &amp; Juliet, from 2005, where the Romanian choreographer reinvents Romeo and Juliet, setting it to the music of Thom Yorke and co. A band who embody the sound of turn-of-millennium anxiety might not be the obvious choice for an early modern romance, but given that Shakespeare\u2019s play is also a story of devastating gang warfare, Clug\u2019s dystopian vision starts to make sense. He drastically strips everything back \u2013 story, set (there isn\u2019t one), costumes, context, even the love. This leaves the music (from Amnesiac, OK Computer and Kid A) to provide simmering unease, palpitating rhythm and a sense of processing towards doom. This is not a story about a connection between two people. Katja Khaniukova, from English National Ballet, is Juliet and Mariinsky principal Denis Matvienko her Romeo, but there\u2019s little emotional substance in their pas de deux. The overriding energy is coolly masculine. Matvientko and a lineup of five men from Clug\u2019s own Slovenian Maribor Ballet, in black suits and with bare chests, dance a speeded-up full-body semaphore, limbs thrown in hard-edged slaps and slices, sometimes turning into a ninja-kicking battle. Handheld black-and-white video is effective in the fight scenes and there are moments of sharp, chilling drama \u2013 such as when the lights close in on dying Mercutio being lifted, clinically, by four men wearing white gloves, his body still twitching. Terrifying. Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui\u2019s Faun provides a salve for the doom, two mythical creatures cavorting in the woods of Nijinsky\u2019s L\u2019Apres Midi d\u2019un Faune reimagined. As it happens, Acosta Danza brought this same piece to London only a few weeks ago, and Acosta\u2019s dancers did it better, but Vyacheslav Lopatin, from the Bolshoi Ballet, nails the faun\u2019s melting-muscled movement.

      "bodyText": "The World Trade Organization is set to plunge into the biggest crisis in its 25-year history later this week as the climax to a long-running and bitter dispute means the Geneva-based body will cease to be able to settle disputes between its member states. Unless Donald Trump backs off at the last minute and agrees to a peace plan, Washington\u2019s protracted battle to safeguard US sovereignty will lead to the neutering of the WTO\u2019s ability to police global trade. However, hopes are fading that the US will agree to a blueprint drawn up by a senior diplomat in Geneva that would keep the WTO\u2019s appellate body \u2013 the ultimate arbiter of trade disputes \u2013 operating beyond the 11 December deadline. One trade source said the failure to resolve the row amounted to an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d for the WTO because it affected its ability to fulfil one of its core functions. The looming paralysis will lead to a backlog of unresolved disputes and make it easier for countries to break WTO trade rules without facing penalties. Trade sources in Geneva admitted that the long-running wrangle over the power wielded by judges on the appellate body was unlikely to be resolved this week and that, as a stopgap measure, attempts would be made to settle disputes by arbitration. Even so, a backlog of cases is likely to build up over the coming months. The US has expressed reservations for many years about the willingness of WTO appellate body judges to overstep their mandate and use their rulings to make trade law. Concerns first raised by Washington when George W Bush was president surfaced again under Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. However, the issue has come to a head since Trump arrived in the White House with a protectionist agenda at odds with the WTO\u2019s commitment to breaking down trade barriers. The appellate body needs a minimum of three judges to function and in recent years the US has been blocking the appointment of new members to replace those on the seven-member panel whose terms have expired. The long-anticipated crunch moment finally arrives at midnight on Tuesday, when two of the remaining three judges to the appellate body have to step down. Resolving a trade dispute between the WTO\u2019s 164 members is a two-stage process, with a country that loses a case having the right to appeal before the aggrieved party can impose retaliatory sanctions. Last week, the US rejected the idea that the terms of the retiring judges should be extended so that they could hear appeals currently in the pipeline. The one concession the US was prepared to make was that judges would be able to complete their deliberations on three cases where hearings had been concluded. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear throughout his term that he has no time for multilateral deals and even less time for WTO judges telling him what he can and cannot do,\u201d said Joe Zammit-Lucia of the Radix thinktank. New Zealand\u2019s trade ambassador to the WTO, David Walker, has been trying to broker a deal that accepted the need for reform of the appellate body and this will be put forward at a three-day meeting of the body\u2019s general council this week. Walker\u2019s plan would involve reducing the financial incentive for judges to string out cases and limit their ability to make rulings that effectively make new trade laws. The US is far from the only WTO member unhappy with what is seen as \u201cmission creep\u201d on the part of the appellate body judges and there is a general acceptance in Geneva that it needs to be reformed. However, Washington has been the most overtly resistant to the idea of its sovereignty being eroded. One trade source said it was time for Trump to make up his mind. \u201cDo the Americans want to fix it or do they want to break it,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>Mark Gatiss is running an hour late for our lunch, but I can forgive him. He seems to have so much on. The co-creator and writer of <em>Sherlock</em> (he also played a beady-eyed Mycroft) has not long finished production on a new incarnation of <em>Dracula</em>, a revamp which will be a headline act of BBC schedules next year. That morning he\u2019s been making the finishing edits to voiceovers for a Bram Stoker documentary that will go out alongside the drama series. He has also devised and directed a Christmas ghost story \u2013 an adaptation of MR James\u2019s tale, <em>Martin\u2019s Close</em>, which pitches Peter Capaldi into the 17th-century courtroom of \u201cHanging Judge\u201d Jeffreys. Add in last year\u2019s sell-out tour of the regathered <em>League of Gentlemen</em>, and his long stint as writer on the revived <em>Doctor Who</em>, and you have a sense of Gatiss, at 53, as a sort of one-man Gothic cottage industry, marshalling a production line of brilliantly knowing grotesques, injecting fresh blood into fireside stories.</p> <p>I wait for him with a beer in the Duke of Cambridge, the organic foodie pub that is his local in Islington (it comes as no surprise to discover that his house around the corner features a Victorian laboratory with cabinets of curiosities). It\u2019s a windy old November afternoon starting to lose its light. I half expect Gatiss to swing through the saloon doors in a cape and a gust of autumn leaves. When he arrives, tall and carefully elegant and grinning and apologising, the best he can offer by way of horrors are ghoulish scrolled photos of himself tricked up as Jacob Rees-Mogg for a Halloween party. \u201cI had some \u2018dead pallor\u2019 makeup which was perfect,\u201d he says, of his pinstriped Mr Hyde. \u201cThe only problem was several people wanted to punch me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We probably have to leave the EU, just to earth the storm. At least then we can say: OK, we\u2019ve done it. Now what?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He\u2019s a regular enough visitor here, often with his husband, the actor Ian Hallard, to know what he wants; in case the kitchen closes he\u2019s ordered ahead for a bowl of cannellini bean stew that comes with a hunk of bread and harissa and a rich broth. Sitting down, he notes how the pub is only a few doors down the road from the house in which Joe Orton lived and died. Gatiss is, by coincidence, off up to Leicester later in the week for an auction to raise money for an Orton statue in the writer\u2019s home city. He has his eye on a couple of facsimiles of those infamous defaced Islington library books from Orton\u2019s indecency trial. \u201cSome of the best filthy comic writing in history,\u201d he says, with his joyful hoot of a laugh.</p> <p>Gatiss seems to have been born for his current vocation. He grew up in Sedgefield, County Durham, in a house opposite an Edwardian asylum, the son of a mining engineer. He was raised on a diet of Alan Bennett and <em>Ripping Yarns</em> and is exhibit A in the power of books to shape a child\u2019s imagination (he loves that Bennett idea of an author\u2019s welcoming hand reaching out from a book and taking yours). Aged five or six and already beginning to be immersed in the <em>Doctor Who</em> stories and Willard Price\u2019s adventure series, he was chosen for special lessons as an advanced reader with Mrs Wiggington at Heighington C of E school. He recalls being awarded a house point for knowing the word \u201csubterranean\u201d. Someone gave him a copy of <em>Great Expectations</em> one Christmas soon after and he was away. \u201cI owe that book an awful lot,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen the plot twist about Magwitch came, I remember my jaw literally dropping open. I still absolutely love it, it\u2019s so full of terror and humanity.\u201d</p> <p>That latter double act, in different comic guises, has been the staple of Gatiss\u2019s writing since he first met Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton at drama school in Yorkshire and they formed <em>The League of Gentlemen</em>. They were on the road with a stage show for a few years before being offered a radio slot and then a TV series by the BBC in 1999. Even then, his family weren\u2019t convinced it was a proper career. \u201cI remember my parents coming down to stay in London in about 2000,\u201d he says. \u201cRonnie Corbett strangely was a very early fan of <em>The League of Gentlemen</em> \u2013 he came to our show in Edinburgh. I mentioned that to my mum and she said: \u2018Well, surely he can do something to help you.\u2019 I said, \u2018Mum, it\u2019s all right, we\u2019ve got our own TV show now.\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cShe was always on at me to learn golf, because that is how Kenneth More got his big break.\u201d</p> <p>Gatiss\u2019s lack of a handicap hasn\u2019t proved an obstacle. It seems, 20 years on, that he has arrived at that rare place where he \u2013 and <em>Sherlock</em> co-creator Steven Moffat \u2013 can pretty much make what they want. How, I wonder, did <em>Dracula</em> happen?</p> <p>\u201cIt came about oddly. We had just started the third series of <em>Sherlock</em> and I had a photograph on my phone of Benedict [Cumberbatch] silhouetted against a door, with his collar up. I showed the picture to Ben Stephenson, then head of drama at the BBC, at an awards dinner and said, \u2018He looks like Dracula, doesn\u2019t he?\u2019 And Ben said: \u2018Do you want to do it?\u2019 That didn\u2019t mean we were commissioned \u2013 that is just where it began.\u201d</p> <p>It feels, I say, like a good year to be creating horror shows. Does he think the dramas we\u2019re drawn to reflect the anxieties we absorb from the news, or act as an escape from them?</p> <p>\u201cI think both,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the 1930s, people wanted to see Busby Berkeley musicals, but there was also a big horror boom.

      "bodyText": "Mark Gatiss is running an hour late for our lunch, but I can forgive him. He seems to have so much on. The co-creator and writer of Sherlock (he also played a beady-eyed Mycroft) has not long finished production on a new incarnation of Dracula, a revamp which will be a headline act of BBC schedules next year. That morning he\u2019s been making the finishing edits to voiceovers for a Bram Stoker documentary that will go out alongside the drama series. He has also devised and directed a Christmas ghost story \u2013 an adaptation of MR James\u2019s tale, Martin\u2019s Close, which pitches Peter Capaldi into the 17th-century courtroom of \u201cHanging Judge\u201d Jeffreys. Add in last year\u2019s sell-out tour of the regathered League of Gentlemen, and his long stint as writer on the revived Doctor Who, and you have a sense of Gatiss, at 53, as a sort of one-man Gothic cottage industry, marshalling a production line of brilliantly knowing grotesques, injecting fresh blood into fireside stories. I wait for him with a beer in the Duke of Cambridge, the organic foodie pub that is his local in Islington (it comes as no surprise to discover that his house around the corner features a Victorian laboratory with cabinets of curiosities). It\u2019s a windy old November afternoon starting to lose its light. I half expect Gatiss to swing through the saloon doors in a cape and a gust of autumn leaves. When he arrives, tall and carefully elegant and grinning and apologising, the best he can offer by way of horrors are ghoulish scrolled photos of himself tricked up as Jacob Rees-Mogg for a Halloween party. \u201cI had some \u2018dead pallor\u2019 makeup which was perfect,\u201d he says, of his pinstriped Mr Hyde. \u201cThe only problem was several people wanted to punch me.\u201d He\u2019s a regular enough visitor here, often with his husband, the actor Ian Hallard, to know what he wants; in case the kitchen closes he\u2019s ordered ahead for a bowl of cannellini bean stew that comes with a hunk of bread and harissa and a rich broth. Sitting down, he notes how the pub is only a few doors down the road from the house in which Joe Orton lived and died. Gatiss is, by coincidence, off up to Leicester later in the week for an auction to raise money for an Orton statue in the writer\u2019s home city. He has his eye on a couple of facsimiles of those infamous defaced Islington library books from Orton\u2019s indecency trial. \u201cSome of the best filthy comic writing in history,\u201d he says, with his joyful hoot of a laugh. Gatiss seems to have been born for his current vocation. He grew up in Sedgefield, County Durham, in a house opposite an Edwardian asylum, the son of a mining engineer. He was raised on a diet of Alan Bennett and Ripping Yarns and is exhibit A in the power of books to shape a child\u2019s imagination (he loves that Bennett idea of an author\u2019s welcoming hand reaching out from a book and taking yours). Aged five or six and already beginning to be immersed in the Doctor Who stories and Willard Price\u2019s adventure series, he was chosen for special lessons as an advanced reader with Mrs Wiggington at Heighington C of E school. He recalls being awarded a house point for knowing the word \u201csubterranean\u201d. Someone gave him a copy of Great Expectations one Christmas soon after and he was away. \u201cI owe that book an awful lot,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen the plot twist about Magwitch came, I remember my jaw literally dropping open. I still absolutely love it, it\u2019s so full of terror and humanity.\u201d That latter double act, in different comic guises, has been the staple of Gatiss\u2019s writing since he first met Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton at drama school in Yorkshire and they formed The League of Gentlemen. They were on the road with a stage show for a few years before being offered a radio slot and then a TV series by the BBC in 1999. Even then, his family weren\u2019t convinced it was a proper career. \u201cI remember my parents coming down to stay in London in about 2000,\u201d he says. \u201cRonnie Corbett strangely was a very early fan of The League of Gentlemen \u2013 he came to our show in Edinburgh. I mentioned that to my mum and she said: \u2018Well, surely he can do something to help you.\u2019 I said, \u2018Mum, it\u2019s all right, we\u2019ve got our own TV show now.\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cShe was always on at me to learn golf, because that is how Kenneth More got his big break.\u201d Gatiss\u2019s lack of a handicap hasn\u2019t proved an obstacle. It seems, 20 years on, that he has arrived at that rare place where he \u2013 and Sherlock co-creator Steven Moffat \u2013 can pretty much make what they want. How, I wonder, did Dracula happen? \u201cIt came about oddly. We had just started the third series of Sherlock and I had a photograph on my phone of Benedict [Cumberbatch] silhouetted against a door, with his collar up. I showed the picture to Ben Stephenson, then head of drama at the BBC, at an awards dinner and said, \u2018He looks like Dracula, doesn\u2019t he?\u2019 And Ben said: \u2018Do you want to do it?\u2019 That didn\u2019t mean we were commissioned \u2013 that is just where it began.\u201d It feels, I say, like a good year to be creating horror shows. Does he think the dramas we\u2019re drawn to reflect the anxieties we absorb from the news, or act as an escape from them? \u201cI think both,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the 1930s, people wanted to see Busby Berkeley musicals, but there was also a big horror boom. It\u2019s one way to contain our fears. I think we are drawn to things like Succession because we need to see the rich and powerful having troubles. But equally we want to watch Spider-Man because we want to believe that there are forces out there that can sort things out for us. It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that these things are co-existing.\u201d Having created a microcosm of little England monsters in the League of Gentlemen\u2019s fictional Royston Vasey \u2013 \u201ca local town for local people\u201d \u2013 Gatiss now encounters them on the Parliament channel. \u201cWe live in an age of popinjays, and so many of them are really weird constructs,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople like Mark Francois, Rees-Mogg, Johnson, the common factor is how much performance is involved.

Marc Chagall, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, Simone Signoret, Georges Pompidou, Yves Saint Laurent, Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, Richard Gere, John Galliano and, of course, Kate might all have found themselves round the same table if, by some trick of time travel, the years had collided. The art deco interior hasn\u2019t changed over the decades, with its ceramic tiles, dark wood and tilted mirrors that allow diners to see who just walked in, or who is sitting on the table behind them.</p> <p>The photograph was taken not long before Moss was to meet Johnny Depp at New York\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Tabac, an establishment where dancing on the tables was almost a requirement. At Brasserie Lipp (where loyal regulars are still seated in the ground floor dining room, never upstairs with the tourists), it is unlikely the maitre d\u2019 would have ever allowed dancing on his tables unless, of course, it was Moss dressed as a bell girl, being photographed by Arthur Elgort for <em>Vogue Italia</em>.</p> <p>Whether Moss enjoyed the brasserie\u2019s speciality of pickled herrings or the signature choucroute Lipp (a hearty dish of sauerkraut, pork, sausage and boiled potato) isn\u2019t clear. She famously once said: \u201cNothing tastes as good as skinny feels\u201d, and it is fair to say three square meals were probably not part of the model\u2019s then supposed daily routine of coffee, fags and more fags. She would no doubt have been made to feel at home with a kir royale or two in the fug of Gauloise smoke.</p> <p>These days, she is still likely to be found dancing on a table, though it might be at home, where she is known to serve up a mean roast chicken dinner with all the trimmings. </p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1993, Kate Moss had the world at her perfect feet. And to prove it, here she is, dancing on the table at Brasserie Lipp in Paris, one of the city\u2019s most celebrated restaurants, known more for its fancy clientele \u2013 a mix of presidents, poets, painters and publishers \u2013 than for haute cuisine. The brasserie was opened in 1880 by the Alsatian sauerkraut and beer aficionado L\u00e9onard Lipp on Boulevard Saint-Germain, opposite the equally feted Caf\u00e9 de Flore and Les Deux Magots. Marc Chagall, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, Simone Signoret, Georges Pompidou, Yves Saint Laurent, Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, Richard Gere, John Galliano and, of course, Kate might all have found themselves round the same table if, by some trick of time travel, the years had collided. The art deco interior hasn\u2019t changed over the decades, with its ceramic tiles, dark wood and tilted mirrors that allow diners to see who just walked in, or who is sitting on the table behind them. The photograph was taken not long before Moss was to meet Johnny Depp at New York\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Tabac, an establishment where dancing on the tables was almost a requirement. At Brasserie Lipp (where loyal regulars are still seated in the ground floor dining room, never upstairs with the tourists), it is unlikely the maitre d\u2019 would have ever allowed dancing on his tables unless, of course, it was Moss dressed as a bell girl, being photographed by Arthur Elgort for Vogue Italia. Whether Moss enjoyed the brasserie\u2019s speciality of pickled herrings or the signature choucroute Lipp (a hearty dish of sauerkraut, pork, sausage and boiled potato) isn\u2019t clear. She famously once said: \u201cNothing tastes as good as skinny feels\u201d, and it is fair to say three square meals were probably not part of the model\u2019s then supposed daily routine of coffee, fags and more fags. She would no doubt have been made to feel at home with a kir royale or two in the fug of Gauloise smoke. These days, she is still likely to be found dancing on a table, though it might be at home, where she is known to serve up a mean roast chicken dinner with all the trimmings.",

      "body": "<p>The Guardian put the following questions to the main politicial parties to draw them out on specific key climate and environmental issues ahead of the election.</p> <h2><strong>Is the climate crisis the biggest issue the UK faces as a nation?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Conservatives</strong>: Yes, it is one of the biggest issues facing the world. Thanks to the efforts of successive governments, the UK has cut carbon emissions by more than any similar developed country. We have also already doubled our support for developing nations to tackle climate change.</p> <p><strong>Greens</strong>: Absolutely. The science is clear: it is the biggest threat facing the UK and the world.</p> <p><strong>Labour</strong>: Yes and this election is our last chance to tackle it. We\u2019re already off course to meet our targets and radical and urgent action over the next five years is essential.</p> <p><strong>Liberal Democrats</strong>: Yes, a Liberal Democrat government would solve Brexit on day one, so climate change would be the biggest issue.</p> <p><strong>SNP</strong>: Scotland \u2013 like the rest of the world \u2013 faces a climate emergency. We have a moral responsibility to tackle climate change and will lead the way in showing how our society can transition to net zero.</p> <h2><strong>Does your party support the students striking from school and/or the Extinction Rebellion protests demanding urgent action on the climate crisis?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Conservatives</strong>: We don\u2019t support students losing out on their education, though we recognise and respect the passion that young people feel. We do not support illegal action that disrupts the lives of ordinary, hardworking people.</p> <p><strong>Greens</strong>: We have supported the school strikers from day one. Young people will be most affected by the effects of climate chaos but don\u2019t have a political voice or vote. [In Extinction Rebellion] a new generation of political activism has been born, and the Green party welcomes and supports that.</p> <p><strong>Labour</strong>: Absolutely. This year saw the blossoming of a global movement calling on politicians to wake up. We have turned its demands into detailed, credible plans for real change.</p> <p><strong>Lib Dems</strong>: Of course we support this action. It is deeply worrying that children are feeling the need to strike because they\u2019re worried about their future. We are supportive of the aims of Extinction Rebellion and support their right to protest. But some of their actions have been counter-productive.</p> <p><strong>SNP</strong>: We applaud the actions by school students in drawing attention to the need for greater urgency in tackling climate change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5d6a08a5f34233f3af462083d7b9ad124efaafe7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d6a08a5f34233f3af462083d7b9ad124efaafe7/0_495_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students march in a \u201cFridays for Future\u201d climate strike on 29 November in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students march in a Fridays for Future climate strike on 29 November in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Will your government use public money to implement a national energy efficiency programme that upgrades millions of homes, reducing carbon emissions and bills?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Conservatives</strong>: We will invest \u00a36.3bn to improve the efficiency of 2.2 million disadvantaged homes. This will reduce their energy bills by as much as \u00a3750 a year. We will also spend \u00a32.9bn levelling up the energy efficiency of our schools and hospitals.</p> <p><strong>Greens</strong>: We will make energy efficiency a national infrastructure priority, and invest the money to upgrade a million homes a year to the highest modern standards [paid for from] general taxation.</p> <p><strong>Labour</strong>: We have the biggest home upgrade programme since the second world war. We aim to upgrade every single home in the UK so that they are warm and energy efficient, bringing household bills down by an average of \u00a3417 per household per year by 2030. Low income households can access these upgrades for free with government grants. Better off households will be able to access zero interest loans.</p> <p><strong>Lib Dems</strong>: Yes. We will invest \u00a315bn over the next parliament to retrofit 26 million homes by 2030. This would save the average household \u00a3550 a year on energy bills.</p> <p><strong>SNP</strong>: The Scottish government is already implementing a national energy efficiency programme with interest-free loans of up to \u00a315,000 and heavy subsidies for low-income households.</p> <h2><strong>Will your government use planning law to actively support onshore wind and solar farms?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Conservatives</strong>: Onshore wind capacity has increased by more than 200% since the Conservatives came into power, but it\u2019s vital that new onshore developments have the support of local communities, who must have the final say over whether to accept new installations in their area.</p> <p><strong>Greens</strong>: The UK has an abundance of the wind, tides, sun and rivers needed to be self-sufficient in energy. We will transform the planning system to support a massive increase in renewable generation. Our energy plan aims for 70% of the UK\u2019s energy to be produced by wind power, with most of the remainder to be made up by other renewables, by the year 2030.</p> <p><strong>Labour</strong>: We\u2019re doing more than just changing the planning laws, we\u2019re going to build them ourselves. We\u2019ll build 2,000 new onshore wind turbines and enough solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches. We\u2019re not going to wait around for the market to pick up its act.</p> <p><strong>Lib Dems</strong>: Yes. We will accelerate the deployment of renewable power, providing more funding, removing the Conservatives\u2019 restrictions on solar and wind. We aim to reach at least 80% renewable electricity in the UK by 2030.</p> <p><strong>SNP</strong>: We will be calling for reform of the UK support for renewables [including] allowing onshore wind and solar power to bid for \u201ccontracts for difference\u201d support \u2013 the UK\u2019s main renewables support mechanism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdf99f87900645ab98cd357f2db782b5c68d8418\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdf99f87900645ab98cd357f2db782b5c68d8418/1253_426_3292_1975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunrise from Seaton Carew beach near Hartlepool with Teesside offshore wind farm in distance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunrise from Seaton Carew beach near Hartlepool with Teesside offshore wind farm in distance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Islandstock/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Will your government set a date for the end of new North Sea oil and gas licences?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Conservatives</strong>: The oil and gas industry employs almost 300,000 people, of whom four in 10 work in Scotland. We believe the North Sea oil and gas industry has a long future ahead because it has a key role to play as we move to a net zero economy. We will support this transition in the next parliament with a transformational sector deal.</p> <p><strong>Greens</strong>: 2024.</p> <p><strong>Labour</strong>: North Sea production peaked in 1999, leaving oil and gas workers and their communities vulnerable. We will create a Just Transition Fund, with costs met through a tax on these corporations. We estimate these costs at around \u00a311bn \u2013 which will cover a support package for nearly 37,000 oil and gas workers, the 126,000 people in jobs dependent on the sector, and their communities, to make the transition to a clean economy.</p> <p><strong>Lib Dems</strong>: Our policies are focused on reducing demand for fossil fuels by investing in transforming power, heating and transport, rather than cutting domestic production, which would be likely to simply increase reliance on more polluting foreign producers.</p> <p><strong>SNP</strong>: The SNP-led Scottish government has established a Just Transition Commission to advise on how to maximise the economic and social benefits of decarbonising Scotland, and manage the risks and challenges, so that we can move to a net-zero economy in a way that is fair for all. We will demand that 12% of the fund \u2013 at least \u00a31bn over five years \u2013 will go to a Net Zero Industrial Strategy to help diversify the economies of oil hubs.</p> <h2><strong>Does your party think the UK needs more new nuclear power stations after Hinkley C and, if so, how will your government fund them?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Conservatives</strong>: Another nuclear power station could provide much needed energy security during those lulls when renewables aren\u2019t generating power. However, this must provide good value for money for billpayers and a Conservative government will look at the best options for delivering that.</p> <p><strong>Greens</strong>: No. We will prohibit the construction of nuclear power stations.

Our ongoing capital commitments include more public transport than roads: \u00a329bn for national roads, in addition to \u00a37bn for local roads, will benefit public transport and cyclists.</p> <p><strong>Greens</strong>: Yes. We will abandon all new road building schemes. Our \u201cgreen new deal\u201d for transport will invest in public transport, walking and cycling so wherever people live they are not forced to use a car, by spending \u00a32.5bn a year on new cycleways and footpaths and making travelling by public transport cheaper than travelling by car, and providing new routes for electric coaches across the country.</p> <p><strong>Labour</strong>: By improving public transport, Labour will help people to become less reliant on their cars.

Will your government increase funding for adaptation and what policies will it introduce to prepare for the inevitable increases in flooding, heatwaves and summer water shortages?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Conservatives</strong>: The impacts of climate change are being felt now, and the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather events are expected to increase. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to invest an additional \u00a34bn in flood defences over the next parliament.</p> <p><strong>Greens</strong>: We will deploy environmentally friendly flood management measures to protect communities from flooding and change the planning system to prevent building on floodplains. We will protect our precious water supplies by enforcing stricter penalties for polluters and for water companies found to be extracting too much water. We will require water companies to enable transportation across the country.</p> <p><strong>Labour</strong>: We will provide an extra \u00a35.6bn in funding to improve flood defences and respond to the increased risk of flooding, prioritising areas at risk in north-west England, Yorkshire and the east Midlands. The prioritisation of short-term shareholder profits have prevented [privatised] water companies from preparing for water shortages. We\u2019ll end this by bringing these companies into democratic control.</p> <p><strong>Lib Dems</strong>: Yes, we will establish a \u00a35bn flooding fund. This money will be used to support small community and council-led schemes to reduce upstream flooding, to improve flood defences and introduce high standards of flood resilience for buildings and infrastructure in high flood risk areas.</p> <p><strong>SNP</strong>: Our MPs will demand the UK accelerates its action to meet Scotland\u2019s climate change targets \u2013 the toughest legal targets in the world \u2013 of a 75% reduction in emissions by 2035, net zero carbon emissions no later than 2040 and net zero of all emissions by 2045.</p> <h2><strong>Will your government ensure that food, farming and environmental standards are not reduced after Brexit?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Conservatives</strong>: Yes \u2013 and as we negotiate our new trade agreement with the EU next year, we will legislate in 2020 to ensure high standards of workers\u2019 rights, environmental protection and consumer rights. In all of our future trade negotiations, we guarantee that we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards.</p> <p><strong>Greens</strong>: Remaining in the European Union is the best option for protecting our food, farming and environmental standards.</p> <p><strong>Labour</strong>: We will secure a new Brexit deal that protects jobs, rights and the environment. We will dynamically align to current EU standards to ensure we don\u2019t fall behind our EU neighbours.</p> <p><strong>Lib Dems</strong>: Yes \u2013 by stopping Brexit</p> <p><strong>SNP</strong>: We believe Scotland should remain in the EU.

      "bodyText": "The Guardian put the following questions to the main politicial parties to draw them out on specific key climate and environmental issues ahead of the election. Is the climate crisis the biggest issue the UK faces as a nation? Conservatives: Yes, it is one of the biggest issues facing the world. Thanks to the efforts of successive governments, the UK has cut carbon emissions by more than any similar developed country. We have also already doubled our support for developing nations to tackle climate change. Greens: Absolutely. The science is clear: it is the biggest threat facing the UK and the world. Labour: Yes and this election is our last chance to tackle it. We\u2019re already off course to meet our targets and radical and urgent action over the next five years is essential. Liberal Democrats: Yes, a Liberal Democrat government would solve Brexit on day one, so climate change would be the biggest issue. SNP: Scotland \u2013 like the rest of the world \u2013 faces a climate emergency. We have a moral responsibility to tackle climate change and will lead the way in showing how our society can transition to net zero. Does your party support the students striking from school and/or the Extinction Rebellion protests demanding urgent action on the climate crisis? Conservatives: We don\u2019t support students losing out on their education, though we recognise and respect the passion that young people feel. We do not support illegal action that disrupts the lives of ordinary, hardworking people. Greens: We have supported the school strikers from day one. Young people will be most affected by the effects of climate chaos but don\u2019t have a political voice or vote. [In Extinction Rebellion] a new generation of political activism has been born, and the Green party welcomes and supports that. Labour: Absolutely. This year saw the blossoming of a global movement calling on politicians to wake up. We have turned its demands into detailed, credible plans for real change. Lib Dems: Of course we support this action. It is deeply worrying that children are feeling the need to strike because they\u2019re worried about their future. We are supportive of the aims of Extinction Rebellion and support their right to protest. But some of their actions have been counter-productive. SNP: We applaud the actions by school students in drawing attention to the need for greater urgency in tackling climate change. Will your government use public money to implement a national energy efficiency programme that upgrades millions of homes, reducing carbon emissions and bills? Conservatives: We will invest \u00a36.3bn to improve the efficiency of 2.2 million disadvantaged homes. This will reduce their energy bills by as much as \u00a3750 a year. We will also spend \u00a32.9bn levelling up the energy efficiency of our schools and hospitals. Greens: We will make energy efficiency a national infrastructure priority, and invest the money to upgrade a million homes a year to the highest modern standards [paid for from] general taxation. Labour: We have the biggest home upgrade programme since the second world war. We aim to upgrade every single home in the UK so that they are warm and energy efficient, bringing household bills down by an average of \u00a3417 per household per year by 2030. Low income households can access these upgrades for free with government grants. Better off households will be able to access zero interest loans. Lib Dems: Yes. We will invest \u00a315bn over the next parliament to retrofit 26 million homes by 2030. This would save the average household \u00a3550 a year on energy bills. SNP: The Scottish government is already implementing a national energy efficiency programme with interest-free loans of up to \u00a315,000 and heavy subsidies for low-income households. Will your government use planning law to actively support onshore wind and solar farms? Conservatives: Onshore wind capacity has increased by more than 200% since the Conservatives came into power, but it\u2019s vital that new onshore developments have the support of local communities, who must have the final say over whether to accept new installations in their area. Greens: The UK has an abundance of the wind, tides, sun and rivers needed to be self-sufficient in energy. We will transform the planning system to support a massive increase in renewable generation. Our energy plan aims for 70% of the UK\u2019s energy to be produced by wind power, with most of the remainder to be made up by other renewables, by the year 2030. Labour: We\u2019re doing more than just changing the planning laws, we\u2019re going to build them ourselves. We\u2019ll build 2,000 new onshore wind turbines and enough solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches. We\u2019re not going to wait around for the market to pick up its act. Lib Dems: Yes. We will accelerate the deployment of renewable power, providing more funding, removing the Conservatives\u2019 restrictions on solar and wind. We aim to reach at least 80% renewable electricity in the UK by 2030. SNP: We will be calling for reform of the UK support for renewables [including] allowing onshore wind and solar power to bid for \u201ccontracts for difference\u201d support \u2013 the UK\u2019s main renewables support mechanism. Will your government set a date for the end of new North Sea oil and gas licences? Conservatives: The oil and gas industry employs almost 300,000 people, of whom four in 10 work in Scotland. We believe the North Sea oil and gas industry has a long future ahead because it has a key role to play as we move to a net zero economy. We will support this transition in the next parliament with a transformational sector deal. Greens: 2024. Labour: North Sea production peaked in 1999, leaving oil and gas workers and their communities vulnerable. We will create a Just Transition Fund, with costs met through a tax on these corporations. We estimate these costs at around \u00a311bn \u2013 which will cover a support package for nearly 37,000 oil and gas workers, the 126,000 people in jobs dependent on the sector, and their communities, to make the transition to a clean economy. Lib Dems: Our policies are focused on reducing demand for fossil fuels by investing in transforming power, heating and transport, rather than cutting domestic production, which would be likely to simply increase reliance on more polluting foreign producers. SNP: The SNP-led Scottish government has established a Just Transition Commission to advise on how to maximise the economic and social benefits of decarbonising Scotland, and manage the risks and challenges, so that we can move to a net-zero economy in a way that is fair for all. We will demand that 12% of the fund \u2013 at least \u00a31bn over five years \u2013 will go to a Net Zero Industrial Strategy to help diversify the economies of oil hubs. Does your party think the UK needs more new nuclear power stations after Hinkley C and, if so, how will your government fund them? Conservatives: Another nuclear power station could provide much needed energy security during those lulls when renewables aren\u2019t generating power. However, this must provide good value for money for billpayers and a Conservative government will look at the best options for delivering that. Greens: No. We will prohibit the construction of nuclear power stations. Renewables can be deployed faster, cheaper and with significantly less risk. Labour: Our priority is investing in and moving to a renewable and low-carbon energy mix. However, years of Tory inaction has left the UK dependent on nuclear. We will build new nuclear power needed for energy security. Lib Dems: No, nuclear power is too expensive. We should be concentrating our resources on renewables. SNP: No, the SNP oppose new nuclear power plants and prioritises investment on cleaner, cheaper forms of electricity generation. Will your government use a post-Brexit subsidy regime to support environmental schemes such as tree planting, soil and peat restoration and flood protection? Will that funding be at least \u00a31bn a year, ie a third of the current EU CAP scheme? Conservatives: By getting Brexit done, we will be able to pass our major environment bill and focus on priorities such as a new scheme of rural payments that prioritises environmental enhancement and protection. We have already confirmed that a Conservative government will match current farm funding in every year of the next parliament but redirect it to environmental schemes. Greens: Whether we leave the EU or not, it is urgent to provide public funding for environmental improvements. It is a Brexiteer myth that we cannot achieve this while we are in the EU. Our manifesto includes \u00a31.7bn per year for the following: peatland restoration; helping farmers transition to more environmentally friendly forms of land use and away from intensive livestock farming; replanting of hedgerows lost in the last 50 years; planting 700m new trees; deploying environmentally friendly flood management measures including soil restoration in uplands. Labour: Yes, assuming the final say of the British people is to leave the EU, we will maintain financial incentives or environmental schemes on our farmlands. It will definitely be more than one third of the current spend from CAP. Lib Dems: We oppose Brexit, but will reform CAP funding to support a \u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d approach, rewarding farmers for environmental schemes. SNP: We will press for an increase in new woodland creation, towards a target of 60m trees planted annually in the UK by 2025, with half in Scotland to help tackle the climate emergency and to support biodiversity and rural employment. Will your government give financial support specifically to rewilding projects to enable the recovery of wildlife? Conservatives: We will set aside \u00a3640m for a specific Nature for Climate fund. This will restore peatland and help us triple tree-planting rates. But we know that sometimes natural regeneration \u2013 rewilding \u2013 can lead to better outcomes both for nature and the climate. Greens: Yes. An ecological crisis is happening \u2013 we must tackle it by restoring, expanding and joining up the wild spaces nature needs to thrive. Labour: We will create 10 new national nature parks and rewild our 10 existing national parks in order to restore natural habitats such as woodland, grasslands, meadows, peatbogs and saltmarshes. We will also create \u201cnatural corridors\u201d in the form of local parks, walking pathways, cycling lanes and canals. Lib Dems: Yes, we will work with farmers and land managers to support nature recovery. SNP: The SNP-led Scottish government has already taken steps in the rewilding of Scotland. We have successfully reintroduced white-tailed eagles to Scotland in recent decades and are in the process of reintroducing beavers. Will your government implement a policy to reduce red meat consumption in the UK? Conservatives: The meat that British farmers produce is already significantly less carbon-intensive than meat produced elsewhere in the world. We will back our farmers to match their own net zero by 2040 ambition with funding to develop new agri-tech to reduce emissions and farm in an even more environmentally friendly way. Greens: Yes.

We will phase in a tax on meat and dairy products over the next 10 years, to reduce the methane produced by livestock. The revenues will help farmers transition to more sustainable farming methods. Labour: We will ask Public Health England to review dietary health guidelines in relation to meat and dairy consumption, in line with scientific and nutritional advice, and we will help our farmers to anticipate and manage any transitions arising from changing consumer demands. Lib Dems: No. Instead we will support farmers to adopt a more environmental method of farming to cut emissions and establish a national food strategy to promote sustainable food \u2013 including public procurement. SNP: The SNP-led Scottish government has set maximum limits for consumption of red processed meat in schools which is linked to an increased risk of cancer. Will your government stop the third runway at Heathrow and/or all airport expansion? Conservatives: Parliament has voted in principle to support a third runway at Heathrow, but it is a private sector project. Heathrow must demonstrate that it can meet its legal obligations for air quality and noise obligations. The scheme will receive no new public money. Greens: Yes. Airport expansion is totally incompatible with tackling the climate emergency. We will scrap plans for airport expansion at Heathrow and across the country. Labour: Any expansion of airports must pass our tests on air quality, noise pollution, climate change obligations and countrywide benefits. Lib Dems: Yes. SNP: Our MPs will closely consider any proposals brought forward by the UK government. Any transport proposals must seriously address the climate emergency. What date will your government set for the end of sales of new internal-combustion engine vehicles? Conservatives: We\u2019ve set a date of 2040, and are consulting on whether we can bring this forward, but we want to do so in a way that takes into account the needs of small businesses and manufacturers. Greens: 2030 at the latest. Labour: 2030. Lib Dems: 2030. SNP: The Scottish government has pledged to phase out new petrol and diesel cars and vans across Scotland by 2032, eight years ahead of the UK government target. Will your party commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building? Conservatives: We will spend more on public transport, walking and cycling than on roads. We spent \u00a336.6bn on transport in England in 2018-19, of which \u00a320.6bn was on public transport.

We aim to spend 10% of the transport budget on walking and cycling by 2025, through both increased capital infrastructure spending and redeploying some of the road building budgets. SNP: We are committed to: investing over \u00a3500m in improved bus priority infrastructure to make bus travel the faster, greener option; reducing emissions from Scotland\u2019s railways to zero by 2035; helping people with the cost of ultra-low emission vehicles. Does your party back clean air zones that charge or ban polluting vehicles in urban areas, which government research shows are the most effective policy to reduce air pollution? Conservatives: It\u2019s important that measures that add costs to motorists are balanced by those that make it easier to choose cleaner options. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll invest \u00a31bn to complete our fast-charging network to ensure you will always be within 30 miles of a rapid electric vehicle charger. Greens: We will civilise our streets by making Low Traffic Neighbourhoods, in which rat-running is blocked, the norm for residential areas and making 20mph the default speed limit. These changes would reduce traffic, carbon emissions and danger to people walking and cycling. Labour: We will introduce a new Clean Air Act, with a vehicle scrappage scheme and clean air zones, complying with World Health Organization limits for fine particles and nitrous oxides. Lib Dems: Yes and we will strengthen the powers of local authorities to do this. SNP: We pledged to create low emission zones in Scotland\u2019s four biggest cities between 2018 and 2020. We will make up to \u00a32.5m available to help commercial and private vehicle owners who face the greatest difficulties in preparing for the transition. The Committee on Climate Change says the UK is unprepared for the impacts of climate change. Will your government increase funding for adaptation and what policies will it introduce to prepare for the inevitable increases in flooding, heatwaves and summer water shortages? Conservatives: The impacts of climate change are being felt now, and the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather events are expected to increase. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to invest an additional \u00a34bn in flood defences over the next parliament. Greens: We will deploy environmentally friendly flood management measures to protect communities from flooding and change the planning system to prevent building on floodplains. We will protect our precious water supplies by enforcing stricter penalties for polluters and for water companies found to be extracting too much water. We will require water companies to enable transportation across the country. Labour: We will provide an extra \u00a35.6bn in funding to improve flood defences and respond to the increased risk of flooding, prioritising areas at risk in north-west England, Yorkshire and the east Midlands. The prioritisation of short-term shareholder profits have prevented [privatised] water companies from preparing for water shortages. We\u2019ll end this by bringing these companies into democratic control. Lib Dems: Yes, we will establish a \u00a35bn flooding fund. This money will be used to support small community and council-led schemes to reduce upstream flooding, to improve flood defences and introduce high standards of flood resilience for buildings and infrastructure in high flood risk areas. SNP: Our MPs will demand the UK accelerates its action to meet Scotland\u2019s climate change targets \u2013 the toughest legal targets in the world \u2013 of a 75% reduction in emissions by 2035, net zero carbon emissions no later than 2040 and net zero of all emissions by 2045. Will your government ensure that food, farming and environmental standards are not reduced after Brexit? Conservatives: Yes \u2013 and as we negotiate our new trade agreement with the EU next year, we will legislate in 2020 to ensure high standards of workers\u2019 rights, environmental protection and consumer rights. In all of our future trade negotiations, we guarantee that we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards. Greens: Remaining in the European Union is the best option for protecting our food, farming and environmental standards. Labour: We will secure a new Brexit deal that protects jobs, rights and the environment. We will dynamically align to current EU standards to ensure we don\u2019t fall behind our EU neighbours. Lib Dems: Yes \u2013 by stopping Brexit SNP: We believe Scotland should remain in the EU. We will campaign to keep the EU\u2019s food, farming and environmental standards in the UK. Some responses have been edited for length. The Brexit party did not provide answers to the questions, but directed people to its \u201ccontract with the people\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 December 2019 to add text clarifying that the Green party supports both the school strikers and the Extinction Rebellion protests.",

      "bodyText": "Iran\u2019s president has presented a draft state budget of about $39bn (\u00a330bn) to parliament, saying it was designed to resist US sanctions by limiting dependence on oil exports. Officials have not given figures for the oil price and export volumes used in the calculations, although the International Monetary Fund has indicated Iran would need oil prices to be triple current levels to balance its budget as its crude exports have plunged. The US reimposed sanctions with the aim of driving down Iranian crude sales, the Islamic Republic\u2019s main source of revenues, after Washington withdrew last year from a nuclear pact between world powers and Iran. \u201cThis is a budget to resist sanctions \u2026 with the least possible dependence on oil,\u201d Hassan Rouhani told parliament, according to state television. \u201cThis budget announces to the world that despite sanctions we can manage the country,\u201d he said. He gave the value of the nominally balanced draft budget at 4,845tn rials for the Iranian year starting on 20 March. The new budget is 10% bigger than this financial year in local currency terms, although its dollar value is lower due to annual inflation that is running at about 35%. The budget forecasts revenues for oil, gas and condensates falling 40%, leaving a gap it plans to plug by using state bonds and selling state properties. Preliminary reports by local news agencies said the budget appeared to be based on oil sales of 500,000 to 1m barrels per day (bpd). Under US sanctions, analysts estimate Iran\u2019s oil exports have tumbled to about 400,000 bpd or even lower, from more than 2.5m bpd. The IMF has said Iran would need an oil price of $194.6 a barrel to balance its budget in 2020-2021 and forecast a fiscal deficit of 4.5% of gross domestic product in 2019-20 and 5.1% in 2020-21. Benchmark Brent oil closed at $64.38 on Friday. Analysts have said Iran has probably been forced to sell its crude at a discount as it seeks to entice buyers wary of violating US sanctions. Although US sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil industry have slashed the Opec member\u2019s crude exports by more than 80%, oil product sales remain strong, generating nearly $500m a month, shipping data and Reuters calculations showed in September. Unlike Iranian crude, which has distinct characteristics that mean its origin can be traced, the source of refined and other oil products are more difficult to identify. Rouhani said Iran hoped a $5bn loan Iran had requested from Russia for development projects would be finalised during the budget year. Rouhani said Iran would continue to subsidise basic goods and medicine in the budget, based at an exchange rate of 42,000 rials to the dollar, compared with the free market rate of 125,000 rials. Using the lower exchange rates makes them more affordable to ordinary Iranians who have complained of surging prices.

Almost a bit of a parmesan-y crystal crunch through it, which I\u2019m a bit of a sucker for. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco Finest Extra Mature English Cheddar, 350g, \u00a33, tesco.com Nutty with a creamy finish. There\u2019s a slightly funny aftertaste, leaves a sort of residue on the palate. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference Cave Aged Cheddar Truckle, 400g, \u00a34, sainsburys.com It\u2019s strong. Really nice kick. This took a while to develop but does have good power. Looks a bit too yellow to me. \u2605\u2605 Potted stiltons Paxton &amp; Whitfield Stilton Jar, 250g, \u00a319.50 paxtonandwhitfield.co.uk This one has a butter cap. Smacks you right between the eyes. Oooh! Wow, it\u2019s really strong, which is excellent. I love a good strong stilton. It\u2019s got great acidity. Texturally it\u2019s a little bit smooth for me but it really packs a punch. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco Stilton Jar, 225g, \u00a34, tesco.com Quite a pale looking stilton\u2026 Wow, that is really potent. Lovely creamy finish. The acidity is really good. It starts off strong and then there\u2019s quite an enjoyable mellowness that comes afterwards. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Marks &amp; Spencer Award Winning Blue Stilton, 300g, \u00a35, marksandspencer.com Nice acidic, stilton punch to it, exactly what you\u2019re looking for. Texturally it\u2019s really nice, with a good clean aftertaste. Sharpness and good creaminess\u2026 I like that a lot. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Waitrose Cropwell Bishop Potted Blue Stilton, 300g, \u00a311, waitrose.com This has a crumblier texture \u2013 fabulous. A little less powerful in flavour. It\u2019s creamy and delicious again. Once you started eating it, you\u2019ll be still sitting there 20 minutes later. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Baked cheeses Morrisons The Best Baking Brie with Cranberries and Sloe Gin Drizzle, 590g, \u00a36, morrisons.com I love the serving dish.

The cheese isn\u2019t strong enough. A bit sickly. \u2605\u2605 Marks &amp; Spencer Brie En-Croute, 729g, \u00a312, marksandspencer.com Looks fabulous but it is very salty and overwhelming. Slight egginess actually. There are big cloves of garlic. \u2605 Salted caramels Hotel Chocolat Milk Salted Caramel Selector, 55g, \u00a33.95, hotelchocolat.com I like the size of this one. That caramel tastes a bit different. This chocolate tastes grown-up. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Chococo Box of Cornish Sea Salt Caramel Chocolates, 100g, \u00a311.50, chococo.co.uk Nostalgic looking. Very runny caramel. It\u2019s got a weird sourness to the caramel\u2026 A bit sickly. \u2605\u2605 Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference Belgian Salted Caramels, 140g, \u00a35, sainsburys.com They look a little cheap. Overly sweet; minimal salt. A bit big. I\u2019m not sure the chocolate is that great. \u2605\u2605 Lily O\u2019Brien\u2019s Salted Caramels Tree Box, 108g, \u00a34.50, lilyobriens.co.uk I like the way this looks. More of a fudgey caramel, with a slightly chalky-fudgey texture. I can\u2019t taste any salt. Incredibly sweet. \u2605\u2605 Chocolate boxes under \u00a310 Co-op Irresistible Luxury Collection, 16 chocolates, \u00a36, coop.co.uk Nice looking little box of chocs. Tasty chocolate and the fillings are quite good too. The best box. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Moser Roth Artisan Collection, 225g, \u00a37.99, aldi.co.uk Quite kiddy looking.

Quite surprising. \u2605\u2605 Cocoa et Co Festive Collection, 155g, \u00a36, sainsburys.co.uk These could go on a Christmas tree. Underwhelming, but not too sweet and you can taste the chocolate. Just not very exciting. \u2605\u2605 Lily O\u2019Brien Winter Desserts Collection, 224g, \u00a37, lilyobriens.co.uk Big chocolates. Crikey \u2026 just sugar. The chocolate does not have much punch. Looks good, but underwhelming flavour, overwhelming sweetness. \u2605 Chocolate boxes under \u00a320 Selfridges Festive Chocolate Collection, 210g, \u00a314.99, selfridges.com These look handmade, artisan.

Where\u2019s all the fruit? I\u2019m not really getting caramel flavour, but it\u2019s tasty and I love the texture. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Heston from Waitrose Black Forest Panettone, 750g, \u00a314, waitrose.com It\u2019s so pretty with cherries on top, and they\u2019re delicious, so succulent. The chocolate on top is good. The inside lets it down, it\u2019s just like fluff. \u2605\u2605 Marks &amp; Spencer The Collection Chocolate, Cranberry &amp; Orange Panettone, 750g, \u00a315, marksandspencer.com Beautiful top, the bread is a bit disappointing. More cranberry please! \u2605\u2605 Mince pies Whole Foods Market Made In Store Mince Pies, 6 for \u00a37.75, wholefoods.co.uk I like the rustic look. Juicy mincemeat and a lovely ratio of filling to pastry. I will buy these. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Morrisons The Best All Butter Mince Pies, 6 for \u00a32, morrisons.com They\u2019re very beautiful; I love the golden rim and gorgeous star. It feels nice and heavy, but the mince is a bit sweet. \u2605\u2605 Aldi Specially Selected Mince Pies, 6 for \u00a31.25, aldi.co.uk Looks pretty. There\u2019s a big wall of pastry. Super sweet, with an overpowering flavour that doesn\u2019t feel traditional. \u2605 Tesco Finest All Butter Deep Filled Mince Pies with Courvoisier VS Cognac, 6 for \u00a32, tesco.com The pastry crumbles very easily and there is something so candyish about the mincemeat, I can\u2019t enjoy it. \u2605 Vegan mince pies Co-op Vegan Mince Pie, 1 for 90p, coop.co.uk This is huge. It tastes like a jam tart; I actually really like it. The pastry isn\u2019t bad, it just feels very crumbly. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Konditor &amp; Cook Vegan Mince Pies, 6 for \u00a310, konditor.co.uk Looks like an Eccles cake. Very sugary pastry top; too sweet for me. The fruit filling is good though. If the top was less sugary \u2026 \u2605\u2605\u2605 Marks &amp; Spencer Vegan Lattice Mince Pies, 6 for \u00a31.25, marksandspencer.com Oh no \u2026 the pastry is too thick, there\u2019s too much of it and it\u2019s dry, so it\u2019s making my mouth dry. Not enough insides. \u2605 Oggs Luxury Handmade Mince Pies, 4 for \u00a32.50, sainsburys.co.uk I don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s horrible inside. That\u2019s a shame. The mincemeat is not nice: very sweet, very overpowering. It looks nice... \u2605 Christmas cakes Marks &amp; Spencer The Collection 6-Month Matured Rich Fruit Cake, 1.54kg, \u00a320, marksandspencer.com Good ratio of cake to icing. Full flavoured. I can imagine spinning it around on my lazy susan. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference Iced Holly Wreath Cake Infused with Brandy, 900g, \u00a310, sainsburys.co.uk Moist; lots of fruit and icing. It\u2019s very dense and rich; would be lovely with a cup of Earl Grey. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Iceland Luxury Christmas Cake, 1kg, \u00a38, iceland.co.uk The icing comes off, the structure is letting it down. It\u2019s heavily spiced, bit much for me \u2013 overpowering. Not my favourite decoration. \u2605\u2605 Co-op Shimmering Iced Christmas Cake, 907g, \u00a37, coop.co.uk Crumbly; there\u2019s not enough fruit, maybe that\u2019s why. Feels more like a Jamaican ginger cake. \u2605 Meringue roulades Waitrose Black Forest Arctic Roulade, 596g, \u00a38, waitrose.com Eye-catching. I like the chocolate shards. It\u2019s crazy sweet, and not cherry-fruity. \u2605 Aldi Specially Selected Winterberry Roulade, 420g, \u00a33.49, aldi.co.uk Reminds me of the sweetest cake I ate as a child. The tart berry stuff is the nicest thing about it - but there\u2019s not enough. \u2605 Waldrons Chocolate &amp; Mascarpone Roulade, 900g, \u00a312, ocado.com Sweet but not chocolatey enough. Too moussey, no bite; messy. \u2605 Asda Extra Special Gin &amp; Gingerbread Roulade, 430g, \u00a34, asda.com Tastes really cardamom-y. I don\u2019t like it. Super sweet and strong tasting. I don\u2019t think you could eat much of it. That\u2019s intense\u2026 \u2605",

What contortions has she made in her 68th year? Why is she still here, when food rationing has gone?</p> <p>The official answer is humanitarianism, which seems like public relations until you look at the numbers. Since 1971, when Julia Morley, the wife of the competition\u2019s founder Eric Morley, became more involved, Miss World has raised more than $1bn for charity. The beauty is undeniable \u2013 the smell of shampoo emanates through this brutalist hotel; it is the hot UN \u2013 but it is put to work. This is the week the contestants are going to the <a href=\"https://www.oxford-union.org/node/2045\" title=\"\">Oxford Union</a> and to visit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/21/zandra-rhodes-interview-fashion-textile-museum\" title=\"\">Zandra Rhodes</a>, and they update their social media constantly to promote Miss World and her causes.

If it is penance it is unnecessary. The fourth wave of feminism has no problem with Miss World, who is very experienced at innocence; it has forgotten her. Miss World is rather prim for these filthy, righteous days: a purity cult whose priestesses have faux-aristocratic manners that are rather better than the manners of real aristocrats; but are so odd, nonetheless, as to be charming. The<strong> </strong>second-wave feminists hated Miss World; but the fourth wave don\u2019t even think about it. I don\u2019t think they know that here yet.</p> <p>Miss World began in 1951 at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_of_Britain\" title=\"\">Festival of Britain</a>, the invention of the Mecca dance hall executive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Morley\" title=\"\">Eric Morley</a>. It was the biggest annual show on earth, although it is no longer on the mainstream channels and will stream this year on <a href=\"https://www.londonlive.co.uk/\" title=\"\">London Live</a>. If its reach has ebbed in western Europe \u2013 it is no longer a sign of nationhood, like a free press or a liberal democracy \u2013 it is huge in China and India, and satellites are booked to beam it across the world, timed to hit the US at breakfast and Asia at supper. More than 900 million people will watch it in 140 countries, and about 100 million will vote in the public rounds.</p> <p>1970 was the year of Miss World\u2019s original trauma, when the 20th competition at the Royal Albert Hall was disrupted. Feminists concealed in an audience composed mostly of women who had won bingo competitions at Mecca, threw flour bombs over Bob Hope, the host. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/03/angry-brigade-prison-bombings-john-barker\" title=\"\">Angry Brigade</a> anarchists set off a bomb under a BBC van, hoping to disrupt the transmission, and the windows blew out. Even so, <a href=\"http://www.jenniferhosten.com/\" title=\"\">Jennifer Hosten</a>, Miss Grenada, was crowned Miss World. Joan Collins was one of the judges. The story is told in a film that opens next year, <em>Misbehaviour</em>, starring Keira Knightley.</p> <p>I wonder if today, with the emphasis on philanthropy and the ostentatious decency \u2013 some contestants are wearing gloves indoors, like the Queen \u2013 they are, psychologically, still in 1970, and that is understandable. You repeat a trauma continually, until you expiate it.</p> <p>There were other controversies for a competition that seemed, for obvious reasons, to be a perfect victim. From 1970-76 they accepted both a black and a white candidate from South Africa. Almost all the contestants come from democracies. China does compete, but there is no Miss Saudi Arabia, no Miss Iran, and no Miss North Korea. There is instead a Miss Korea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38cd47aaec7cf8a3a7d4f4b24f20bf677ef71cf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38cd47aaec7cf8a3a7d4f4b24f20bf677ef71cf8/228_0_3446_4307/800.jpg\" alt=\"Crowning glory: Bob Hope with Miss Grenada, Jennifer Hosten, who became Miss World at the controversial 1970 ceremony.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crowning glory: Bob Hope with Miss Grenada, Jennifer Hosten, who became Miss World at the controversial 1970 ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter King/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1974, Marjorie Wallace, Miss America, was dethroned for immorality of the most thrilling kind: she was photographed kissing Tom Jones while engaged to a famous racing driver, although she is still on the website that functions as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_World#Winners_gallery\" title=\"\">the wall of fame</a>.

They look both similar and various. Most are very young. None are overweight, of course; in this sense Miss World is immune to the fashionable diktats of equality. But she is multicultural by nature. Not all of them are dressed like Ivanka Trump, but most are; one is dressed like Joan Crawford as Mildred Pierce (Miss Italy in a black suit); another as Morticia Addams (Miss Peru in a bat cape). Later, one will wear a Russian-style fur hat; another a vast feathered headdress.</p> <p>A choreographer prods them into a line, and they retire to a press room for interviews. Some are attached to their telephones, making videos for MobStar; winning the social media category can process you onwards. There are other heats for talent, charity and sport; you can watch all this on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialMissWorld/videos?app=desktop\" title=\"\">YouTube</a>, where Miss World has its own channel. When they are needed for an interview, a Miss World employee shouts \u201cScotland!\u201d or \u201cSweden!\u201d or \u201cBelgium!\u201d Views across the social media platforms \u2013 Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and MobStar \u2013 are already above 1bn, and it is only the first day.</p> <p>I meet Julia Morley, Eric\u2019s widow of 19 years, in a room with huge windows overlooking the bridge. When I allude to Miss World in the 1950s she sighs slightly. \u201cThere was nothing wrong with it in those days,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to realise it was 1951, just after the war, London had been bombed to pieces.\u201d That is an odd defence \u2013 beauty pageants were necessary to recover from Hitler \u2013 and unnecessary, because the more time I spend here, the better I like it. It\u2019s odd, of course, like wandering up a Magic Faraway Tree. But we are in the middle of a fierce election, and this much politesse is soothing, wherever it comes from.</p> <p>If it is a pastiche of good manners, it is better than the original and I am fond of oddness of all kinds. \u201cToday, of course, you would say Women\u2019s Lib,\u201d Morley says, \u201cbut you have to look at the era.\u201d It was acceptable for silent women to wear bikinis on the stage. It was institutional sexism. I condemn my 11-year-old self for her sexism but, in my defence, I<strong> </strong>liked the evening gown round best.</p> <p>I think, behind her serenity \u2013 she sets an example \u2013 the sexism really bothered Morley; either that or she is the most cynical person who has ever lived, and I don\u2019t believe that. She describes her thoughts about the contest in 1970: \u201cI don\u2019t really have a strong view. I\u2019m not there to jump on anyone\u2019s bandwagon and get involved with things I didn\u2019t worry about too much at the time.\u201d She laughs. \u201cIt was a huge success,\u201d she says, \u201cand because it was so successful they continued to run it as a public relations exercise, and all the money raised went to the <a href=\"https://www.variety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Variety Club</a>. But that was then.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25b57fd4c34e8e397c8bfce7b3c32a466ba91e95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25b57fd4c34e8e397c8bfce7b3c32a466ba91e95/0_0_4950_4007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winning votes: the Morleys out canvassing with Margaret and Denis Thatcher in south London, where Eric stood as a Tory in 1979.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"809\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winning votes: the Morleys out canvassing with Margaret and Denis Thatcher in south London, where Eric stood as a Tory in 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morley tells me a story about a charity worker she met in Singapore, whom she saw tending to beggars from her hotel room. She tells the story in great detail, and slowly, because it is important: her creation story. \u201cI said to the woman: \u2018Don\u2019t you ever get tired of this?\u2019 It wasn\u2019t quite as I meant it to come out. \u2018Is it not better,\u2019 the woman replied, \u2018to light one candle in the darkness than not to see at all?\u2019 It\u2019s not usual,\u201d says Morley, \u201cfor me to jump at something like that, but it did mean a lot to me. I thought: that is what I should be doing. Was I comfortable seeing them wander about in swimsuits? They didn\u2019t really have a chance to show who they were\u2026 just their bodies. And,\u201d she adds carefully, \u201cthere was nothing wrong with that.\u201d</p> <p>She changed Miss World\u2019s course with a programme called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_with_a_Purpose\" title=\"\">Beauty with a Purpose</a>: what a pointed title. Today all the contestants promote a cause in their homeland, and a willingness to do so is essential to success; beauty pageantry reinvented as workaholism. Miss World is a job now, and the job is decency in silks. They are not social justice activists, although their impact, with their humanitarian work, is the same: they do it, rather, without anger and without politics.</p> <p>In 2011, to mark its 40th birthday, Nelson Mandela sent a message of congratulations.<strong> </strong>Morley spends the rest of the hour speaking about her causes: parasites in children\u2019s feet, easily cured if you care; an unstable bridge which maimed a child; the production of food. They are more interesting to her than the logistics of Miss World, which she has lived with for 60 years.</p> <p>I also meet the current Miss World, the former Miss Mexico, Vanessa Ponce. She seems extraordinarily alive; very emotionally porous; and winning; that is, she is the kind of person it is impossible not to love. There wasn\u2019t much money growing up \u2013 she applied for a scholarship to study international business in Germany and failed. \u201cI wanted to be free,\u201d she says. That had been her idea of freedom, but she knows better now; this is her considered narrative. Instead she won Mexico\u2019s <em>Next Top Model</em>: \u201cI started feeling very empty. People are not very nice to you. They treat you as a product.\u201d</p> <p>She did one last commercial for a migrant shelter. She stayed for three weeks; peeled carrots; helped a woman give birth. That, then, is her creation story. They all have one. She spends more time in airports than she does in Mexico now. She speaks about Miss World as if it is a spiritually transformative experience: \u201cIt makes you more patient, more tolerant, you start seeing everyone as an equal.\u201d She says she needs \u201cto feel useful\u201d. Then she says: \u201cThe job is to be there for people, to show them there is faith. People need to feel that warmth from you. That is what Miss World is \u2013 a light to guide you on.\u201d That looks ridiculous in print, but it wasn\u2019t from her mouth. \u201cI have never been the most beautiful,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m an average beauty.\u201d I\u2019m aghast by how she coolly measures it; it is the most mortal she sounds. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t really care about that.\u201d Her job is to \u201cbe that person that inspires all this. Imagine the figure of a woman that you admire. What are the qualities?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Certainly, they all seem happy, and who wants a depressed beauty queen?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I meet many others \u2013 pageant queens, lawyers, doctors, professional rugby players \u2013 and they all carefully, or dramatically, emit some version of this in unembarrassed rote, with varying degrees of intensity and eloquence; and it is soothing. It is narcotic and, though I don\u2019t believe in it all \u2013 some are simply models burnishing their brand, or holidaying in London \u2013 I like listening to them try to conjure it into being, even if they do sound a lot like the Duchess of Sussex; and I don\u2019t know what it costs them, and I don\u2019t know how long it will last. Certainly, they seem happy, and who wants a depressed beauty queen? Miss World is also a place in which they can exist online, protected from abuse; no such protections exist on Instagram.</p> <p>So, it was oddly pure in the end \u2013 and to a woman, unthreatening, which is probably why I left the hotel imagining I loved them. Miss World now is more like a religious movement with a commercial arm than something to excite the male gaze and devastate the female one with miserable comparisons. Morley has, with her obsessive focus on philanthropy, stripped all sex from the contest. I wonder if it is penance for the awful sexism that came before; or revenge on the men who performed it. Either way, Miss World is a glowing archetype; and how you view her, as ever, depends on where, exactly, on the feminist spectrum you stand.</p> <p><em>Miss World 2019 will be crowned on 14 December in London</em></p>",

The second-wave feminists hated Miss World; but the fourth wave don\u2019t even think about it. I don\u2019t think they know that here yet. Miss World began in 1951 at the Festival of Britain, the invention of the Mecca dance hall executive Eric Morley. It was the biggest annual show on earth, although it is no longer on the mainstream channels and will stream this year on London Live. If its reach has ebbed in western Europe \u2013 it is no longer a sign of nationhood, like a free press or a liberal democracy \u2013 it is huge in China and India, and satellites are booked to beam it across the world, timed to hit the US at breakfast and Asia at supper.

From 1970-76 they accepted both a black and a white candidate from South Africa. Almost all the contestants come from democracies. China does compete, but there is no Miss Saudi Arabia, no Miss Iran, and no Miss North Korea. There is instead a Miss Korea. In 1974, Marjorie Wallace, Miss America, was dethroned for immorality of the most thrilling kind: she was photographed kissing Tom Jones while engaged to a famous racing driver, although she is still on the website that functions as the wall of fame. In 1980, Gabriella Brum, Miss Germany, resigned after nude photographs emerged. The Pope complained, but he always does. There is no Miss Vatican City either, which is disappointing. They should send a nun. I watch this year\u2019s hopefuls walk out to the riverside by Tower Bridge for the press launch. They look both similar and various. Most are very young. None are overweight, of course; in this sense Miss World is immune to the fashionable diktats of equality. But she is multicultural by nature. Not all of them are dressed like Ivanka Trump, but most are; one is dressed like Joan Crawford as Mildred Pierce (Miss Italy in a black suit); another as Morticia Addams (Miss Peru in a bat cape). Later, one will wear a Russian-style fur hat; another a vast feathered headdress. A choreographer prods them into a line, and they retire to a press room for interviews. Some are attached to their telephones, making videos for MobStar; winning the social media category can process you onwards. There are other heats for talent, charity and sport; you can watch all this on YouTube, where Miss World has its own channel. When they are needed for an interview, a Miss World employee shouts \u201cScotland!\u201d or \u201cSweden!\u201d or \u201cBelgium!\u201d Views across the social media platforms \u2013 Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and MobStar \u2013 are already above 1bn, and it is only the first day. I meet Julia Morley, Eric\u2019s widow of 19 years, in a room with huge windows overlooking the bridge. When I allude to Miss World in the 1950s she sighs slightly. \u201cThere was nothing wrong with it in those days,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to realise it was 1951, just after the war, London had been bombed to pieces.\u201d That is an odd defence \u2013 beauty pageants were necessary to recover from Hitler \u2013 and unnecessary, because the more time I spend here, the better I like it. It\u2019s odd, of course, like wandering up a Magic Faraway Tree. But we are in the middle of a fierce election, and this much politesse is soothing, wherever it comes from. If it is a pastiche of good manners, it is better than the original and I am fond of oddness of all kinds. \u201cToday, of course, you would say Women\u2019s Lib,\u201d Morley says, \u201cbut you have to look at the era.\u201d It was acceptable for silent women to wear bikinis on the stage. It was institutional sexism. I condemn my 11-year-old self for her sexism but, in my defence, I liked the evening gown round best. I think, behind her serenity \u2013 she sets an example \u2013 the sexism really bothered Morley; either that or she is the most cynical person who has ever lived, and I don\u2019t believe that. She describes her thoughts about the contest in 1970: \u201cI don\u2019t really have a strong view. I\u2019m not there to jump on anyone\u2019s bandwagon and get involved with things I didn\u2019t worry about too much at the time.\u201d She laughs. \u201cIt was a huge success,\u201d she says, \u201cand because it was so successful they continued to run it as a public relations exercise, and all the money raised went to the Variety Club. But that was then.\u201d Morley tells me a story about a charity worker she met in Singapore, whom she saw tending to beggars from her hotel room. She tells the story in great detail, and slowly, because it is important: her creation story. \u201cI said to the woman: \u2018Don\u2019t you ever get tired of this?\u2019 It wasn\u2019t quite as I meant it to come out. \u2018Is it not better,\u2019 the woman replied, \u2018to light one candle in the darkness than not to see at all?\u2019 It\u2019s not usual,\u201d says Morley, \u201cfor me to jump at something like that, but it did mean a lot to me. I thought: that is what I should be doing. Was I comfortable seeing them wander about in swimsuits? They didn\u2019t really have a chance to show who they were\u2026 just their bodies. And,\u201d she adds carefully, \u201cthere was nothing wrong with that.\u201d She changed Miss World\u2019s course with a programme called Beauty with a Purpose: what a pointed title. Today all the contestants promote a cause in their homeland, and a willingness to do so is essential to success; beauty pageantry reinvented as workaholism. Miss World is a job now, and the job is decency in silks. They are not social justice activists, although their impact, with their humanitarian work, is the same: they do it, rather, without anger and without politics. In 2011, to mark its 40th birthday, Nelson Mandela sent a message of congratulations. Morley spends the rest of the hour speaking about her causes: parasites in children\u2019s feet, easily cured if you care; an unstable bridge which maimed a child; the production of food. They are more interesting to her than the logistics of Miss World, which she has lived with for 60 years. I also meet the current Miss World, the former Miss Mexico, Vanessa Ponce. She seems extraordinarily alive; very emotionally porous; and winning; that is, she is the kind of person it is impossible not to love. There wasn\u2019t much money growing up \u2013 she applied for a scholarship to study international business in Germany and failed. \u201cI wanted to be free,\u201d she says. That had been her idea of freedom, but she knows better now; this is her considered narrative. Instead she won Mexico\u2019s Next Top Model: \u201cI started feeling very empty. People are not very nice to you. They treat you as a product.\u201d She did one last commercial for a migrant shelter. She stayed for three weeks; peeled carrots; helped a woman give birth. That, then, is her creation story. They all have one. She spends more time in airports than she does in Mexico now. She speaks about Miss World as if it is a spiritually transformative experience: \u201cIt makes you more patient, more tolerant, you start seeing everyone as an equal.\u201d She says she needs \u201cto feel useful\u201d. Then she says: \u201cThe job is to be there for people, to show them there is faith. People need to feel that warmth from you. That is what Miss World is \u2013 a light to guide you on.\u201d That looks ridiculous in print, but it wasn\u2019t from her mouth. \u201cI have never been the most beautiful,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m an average beauty.\u201d I\u2019m aghast by how she coolly measures it; it is the most mortal she sounds. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t really care about that.\u201d Her job is to \u201cbe that person that inspires all this. Imagine the figure of a woman that you admire. What are the qualities?\u201d I meet many others \u2013 pageant queens, lawyers, doctors, professional rugby players \u2013 and they all carefully, or dramatically, emit some version of this in unembarrassed rote, with varying degrees of intensity and eloquence; and it is soothing. It is narcotic and, though I don\u2019t believe in it all \u2013 some are simply models burnishing their brand, or holidaying in London \u2013 I like listening to them try to conjure it into being, even if they do sound a lot like the Duchess of Sussex; and I don\u2019t know what it costs them, and I don\u2019t know how long it will last. Certainly, they seem happy, and who wants a depressed beauty queen? Miss World is also a place in which they can exist online, protected from abuse; no such protections exist on Instagram. So, it was oddly pure in the end \u2013 and to a woman, unthreatening, which is probably why I left the hotel imagining I loved them. Miss World now is more like a religious movement with a commercial arm than something to excite the male gaze and devastate the female one with miserable comparisons. Morley has, with her obsessive focus on philanthropy, stripped all sex from the contest. I wonder if it is penance for the awful sexism that came before; or revenge on the men who performed it. Either way, Miss World is a glowing archetype; and how you view her, as ever, depends on where, exactly, on the feminist spectrum you stand. Miss World 2019 will be crowned on 14 December in London",

For Brussels, the damage to the Iran deal has been a vivid illustration of how Trump undermines EU sovereignty. The EU sought to keep the deal alive by setting up a barter mechanism designed to allow Iran to continue selling oil and import other goods in exchange. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/01/six-more-countries-join-trump-busting-iran-barter-group\">more countries have joined the Instex barter group</a>, European companies have so far not used it, fearing US retaliation.</p>\n    <p><b>Brexit<br></b>For many in Brussels, Paris and Berlin, the British decision to quit the European Union is Trump\u2019s older twin.

But despite being one of Europe\u2019s biggest military powers, the UK could be blocked from taking part in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/19/eu-ministers-approve-spy-school-plan-in-raft-of-defence-initiatives\">EU military projects</a>.

Diplomats say this trip goes far beyond migration, an increasingly dominant issue, as Brussels seeks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/31/2bn-eu-africa-anti-migration-fund-too-opaque-say-critics\">deter would-be migrants</a> from coming to Europe and return those with no right to stay.</p>\n    <p><b>Syria<br></b>Syria has been wrecked by eight years of war: more than half the population have been forced to flee their homes, while an estimated 11.7 million people need humanitarian aid.

Now the power balance has shifted back to Russian-backed Bashar al-Assad, leaving the EU with a dilemma: whether to help fund reconstruction to ease suffering and help refugees return, but risk empowering Assad\u2019s regime. The International Crisis Group, which pinpointed the problem in <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/eastern-mediterranean/syria/209-ways-out-europes-syria-reconstruction-conundrum\">a recent report</a>, called on the EU to help fund basic public services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Borrell, the son of a baker from the Catalan Pyrenees, has acquired a reputation for being plain-spoken \u2013 or undiplomatic, depending on your point of view. In one of his first interviews as Spain\u2019s foreign minister last year, he lamented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/stranded-migrants-aquarius-to-be-taken-to-spain-says-french-charity\">Europe\u2019s \u201costrich politics\u201d</a> when it came to migration and demographics.</p> \n<p>Three months later, Borrell revealed that Donald Trump had suggested to him that Spain should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/19/donald-trump-urged-spain-to-build-the-wall-across-the-sahara\">tackle the migration crisis by building a wall across the Sahara</a> \u2013 apparently unaware that such a wall would have to be 3,000 miles long. In May this year, he accused the US of acting \u201clike the cowboys\u201d over the turmoil in Venezuela. A few months previously, he had apologised for downplaying the extermination of native Americans by claiming that the US had little in the way of history apart from \u201ckilling four Indians\u201d.</p> \n<p>Presumed to be in his last job, Borrell has one big task: to strengthen the EU\u2019s role in the world.

They tell us their sufferings, we express our condolences and concern \u2026 but no capacity for action comes out of it and we just move on to the next one.\u201d On Monday, this political survivor will walk into that valley for the first time since becoming the EU\u2019s diplomat-in-chief, a role previously held by Italy\u2019s Federica Mogherini and Britain\u2019s Cathy Ashton. Borrell, the son of a baker from the Catalan Pyrenees, has acquired a reputation for being plain-spoken \u2013 or undiplomatic, depending on your point of view. In one of his first interviews as Spain\u2019s foreign minister last year, he lamented Europe\u2019s \u201costrich politics\u201d when it came to migration and demographics. Three months later, Borrell revealed that Donald Trump had suggested to him that Spain should tackle the migration crisis by building a wall across the Sahara \u2013 apparently unaware that such a wall would have to be 3,000 miles long. In May this year, he accused the US of acting \u201clike the cowboys\u201d over the turmoil in Venezuela. A few months previously, he had apologised for downplaying the extermination of native Americans by claiming that the US had little in the way of history apart from \u201ckilling four Indians\u201d. Presumed to be in his last job, Borrell has one big task: to strengthen the EU\u2019s role in the world. Or as per the instructions of his boss, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen: \u201cThe European Union needs to be more strategic, more assertive and more united in its approach to external relations.\u201d Von der Leyen, who also took office this month, has declared she wants to lead \u201ca geopolitical commission\u201d, suggesting the EU should have the foreign policy clout to match its status as the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc. EU insiders worry about threats to European sovereignty, the risk of being a pawn on the global chessboard, swept aside by a capricious US president or an authoritarian China. \u201cThe EU has yet to fulfil its potential as a global actor,\u201d states a paper from nine EU member states, including France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, who warn that the \u201ctectonic plates underpinning the international rules-based order are shifting\u201d. These countries would like EU foreign policy to be characterised by faster decisions and more robust discussions. Easier said than done, especially when domestic weakness of some EU leaders combines with different world views of member states on issues such as the transatlantic relationship, Turkey or the Middle East. \u201cThe council is in a really low moment,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Torreblanca, the head of the Madrid office at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cNot only in its institutional shortcomings, but the political configuration of the leadership, the appetite for doing things. It is not really a place where a lot of things happen in terms of decision making.\u201d The problem, said Torreblanca, is that Germany is \u201cdivided\u201d and \u201cparalysed\u201d at home, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, tables proposals without discussing them with Berlin. \u201cThe Franco-German relationship is quite broken when it comes to foreign policy.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cBritain is lost\u201d, while countries like Hungary increasingly seek \u201cto block everything \u2013 they just don\u2019t want the body to work\u201d. Torreblanca, who conducted the \u201cvalley of tears\u201d interview, concludes that Borrell\u2019s frustrations were shaped by his experience with Venezuela, when the EU was split over whether to support opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, who sought to topple Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power. As Spain\u2019s foreign minister, Borrell helped craft the EU line on Venezuela, but failed to persuade Italy, Greece and others to support Guaid\u00f3, blunting the EU message. In the ECFR interview, Borrell said the EU was caught \u201csleeping on the job\u201d on Venezuela after \u201cinterminable discussions about minor bureaucratic matters\u201d. The EU has also struggled to maintain a united position on the Middle East. Hungary recently blocked an attempt by the EU to criticise Trump\u2019s decision that Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory should no longer be seen as illegal. The 28 countries issued a less punchy statement that EU policy was \u201cunchanged\u201d, calling on Israel to end all settlement activity. Counterintuitively, some EU diplomats think risking more arguments could help forge unity. Borrell\u2019s predecessor, Mogherini, has faced criticism for steering clear of some tricky issues, such as EU-Russia relations. \u201cWhat she wanted was to avoid conflict, and I think it was a mistake,\u201d one EU diplomat said. Borrell, aged 72, is not expected to be hopping on planes as often as Mogherini, so could play a stronger role in corralling common decisions. EU diplomats are hopeful that he might delegate EU foreign policy topics to a country or group of countries, an approach that has been used in a sporadic way, such dealing with Venezuela. Nathalie Tocci, a former adviser to Mogherini, thinks EU foreign policy is stronger than it appears. \u201cJust remember Iraq 2003, when the split was so debilitating that it completely paralysed the union,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we actually have positions on Russia and China. Obviously there are nuances \u2026 but it is not simply a lowest common denominator.\u201d Tocci, the director of Italy\u2019s Institute for International Affairs, cautions that a single European foreign policy may not be realistic or desirable. She would prefer Borrell to be like an orchestra conductor, seeking complex harmonies, rather than a one-note song. \u201cThe different instruments are playing different tunes, but ultimately what comes out of it is something that sounds quite nice and not a complete cacophony.\u201d \u201cIf that\u2019s the goal, yes, it is achievable.\u201d Additional reporting by Sam Jones in Madrid",

A report that year by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-sets-up-inquiry-into-labour-antisemitism-claims\">Shami Chakrabarti</a>&nbsp;exonerated the party of widespread antisemitism but reported an 'occasionally toxic atmosphere'.</p>\n    <p>Matters escalated in 2018 when it became evident that the party was receiving more and more complaints, to the extent that there was a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/20/jewish-labour-group-accuses-failing-act-antisemitism\">backlog of disciplinary cases</a>. Jeremy Corbyn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/05/corbyn-sorry-for-hurt-inflicted-on-jewish-people-by-antisemitism-row-labour\">apologised that April</a>&nbsp;for hurt caused to the Jewish community by problems in the process and pointed to only 0.1% of members being under investigation for alleged antisemitic comments.</p>\n    <p>But the party was also mired in a row about whether to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/04/labour-adopts-ihra-antisemitism-definition-in-full\">ended up ultimately approving</a>. Then accusations of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/02/new-labour-party-row-over-antisemitism-jeremy-corbyn\">political interference in the complaints process</a>&nbsp;by aides close to Corbyn began to emerge earlier this year, which the party strongly denies.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When did the complaints about antisemitism turn into a full-blown crisis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The resignations of some MPs and peers over antisemitism in February 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/28/labour-worst-day-shame-tom-watson-luciana-berger-resignation\">alarmed many Labour colleagues</a>. Then Chris Williamson, a Labour MP and ally of Corbyn, caused an outcry for saying that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/feb/27/chris-williamson-says-labour-has-been-too-apologetic-about-antisemitism-video\">&nbsp;the party had been 'too apologetic' about antisemitism complaints</a>. However, many of his supporters in the party backed a campaign saying he had been vilified and badly treated. Then came the announcement that the Equalities and Human Rights Commission was placing the party&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\">under formal investigation</a>&nbsp;over antisemitism.</p>\n    <p>In November 2019 the chief rabbi,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/labour-has-let-poison-of-antisemitism-take-root-says-chief-rabbi\">Ephraim Mirvis, said Jews are justifiably anxious</a>&nbsp;about the idea of Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, saying a \u201cpoison sanctioned from the top\u201d has taken root in Labour.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What allegations were made in the BBC Panorama documentary?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In a July 2019 programme, eight whistleblowers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">spoke to a BBC Panorama documentary</a>, with some saying they felt there was political meddling from Corbyn\u2019s office in the process for handling antisemitism complaints. Seumas Milne, one of Corbyn\u2019s closest aides, told officials the party was 'muddling up political disputes with racism' and must review processes. Jennie Formby, the general secretary, was accused of attempting to interfere in who sat on a panel examining the case of Jackie Walker, a high-profile activist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/labour-expels-jackie-walker-for-leaked-antisemitism-comments\">who was eventually expelled from the party</a>.<br></p>\n    <p>Labour&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">strongly denied the allegations</a>&nbsp;of political interference, and came out on the offensive, accusing the BBC of bias and calling for the documentary to be pulled. A Labour spokesman said the party had fully answered \u201ca number of questions\u201d put to it by the programme, and had also sent 50 pages of documents in response. The complaints to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\">BBC</a>&nbsp;had been made \u201cat various levels, including the director general\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Has Corbyn himself been criticised over antisemitism?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Yes, particularly his record when he was a backbencher. For example, Corbyn has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/jeremy-corbyn-says-he-regrets-calling-hamas-and-hezbollah-friends\">said he regrets</a>&nbsp;calling members of Hamas and Hezbollah \u201cfriends\u201d at a meeting in parliament in 2009. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/23/corbyn-criticised-after-backing-artist-behind-antisemitic-mural\">He accepted he had made a mistake</a>&nbsp;by supporting a graffiti artist after his work, featuring several known antisemitic tropes, was removed from a wall in east London after complaints. The UK\u2019s three most prominent Jewish newspapers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/25/jewish-newspapers-claim-corbyn-poses-existential-threat\">published a joint editorial</a>&nbsp;saying a government led by Corbyn would pose an existential threat to Jewish life in the UK.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How has Labour dealt with candidates accused of antisemitism?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Labour insists the a figure of 130 outstanding cases of antisemitism is inaccurate, and says it is \u201ctaking robust action\u201d, including quick suspensions, a process for rapid expulsions and an education programme. However, it has not yet provided its own up-to-date figure.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Some prospective candidates have been accused of antisemitism during the campaign. Gideon Bull stepped down in Clacton after denying he&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/08/gideon-bull-labour-candidate-pulls-out-of-election-over-shylock-remarks\">used the term \u201cShylock\u201d</a>&nbsp;in front of a Jewish councillor, while Kate Ramsden, who had been standing for Gordon, in Aberdeenshire, withdrew after it emerged she was being re-interviewed by Labour over posts&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/labour-candidate-kate-ramsden-steps-down-israel-comparison\">comparing Israel to \u201can abused child who becomes an abusive adult\u201d</a>. However, other candidates criticised for antisemitism have remained in place, including Apsana Begum, who shared a post referring to \u201cZionist masters\u201d. She later distanced herself from the post saying she did not share those views.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\"><b>Peter Walker</b></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason\"><b>Rowena Mason</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He added: \u201cI hope \u2026 having gone through this horrible, horrible period, we come out of it now actually showing respect to the Jewish community and tackling this issue and enabling the Labour party to tackle antisemitism in our wider society.\u201d</p> \n<p>His comments came after a leak of documents from Labour\u2019s disciplinary department to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/exposed-the-secret-labour-files-of-shame-mwhhfkknv\">the Sunday Times</a>, which included a recording of an official complaining that more than 130 cases were outstanding even though the majority were reported to the party 18 months ago and one had been on the books for more than three years.</p> \n<p>The cases included members likening Jewish people to killer viruses, labelling them \u201cbent nose manipulative liars\u201d and calling for the \u201cextermination of every Jew on the planet\u201d.</p> \n<p>It reportedly took 10 months for the party to expel a member in Nottingham who wrote that \u201cJews represent a viral infection that need to be completely eliminated\u201d and said he wanted the \u201ccomplete extinction of all Jews\u201d.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday morning, McDonnell said it was his understanding that the number of outstanding cases was \u201cwell below\u201d the 136 reported.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was a small number, but I don\u2019t care how many it was,\u201d he said. \u201cOne antisemite is too many, and what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve started kicking them out in numbers.

Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqia\u0121vik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. In the summer of 2019, an Arctic heatwave saw parts of Greenland reach temperatures 40C hotter than normal.</p>\n    <p>The Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at around 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect.</p>\n    <p>These \"rapid\" and \"unprecedented\" changes are transforming the Arctic and threatening traditional ways of life, according to US government scientists in a 2019 report card. The sea ice is younger, thinner, more fragile and less extensive, making hunting on the ice harder and more perilous. The marine ecosystem is shifting as warmer water forces fish species to retreat to more northern waters.</p>\n    <p>What is a major challenge to communities in the Arctic, is a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will get even simpler once the Arctic is ice free in summertimes, forecast as soon as 2040s.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>By drawing on satellite data and user-submitted tagging, Siku\u2019s developers hope to provide better and more up-to-date information to hunters.</p> \n<p>In one example, the society\u2019s executive director, Joel Heath, told how a hunter saw a narrow crack in sea ice.

      "body": "<h2>Soupe au pistou at Le Bistrot du Paradou, France</h2> <p><em>Rick Stein, chef and food writer</em></p> <p>My friend John Illsley, who was the bass guitarist in Dire Straits, recommended that we go to Le Bistrot du Paradou. The first thing I liked was that there was no choice on the menu: just one starter, one main course, one pud, and cheese. The menu changed every day. No choice, a very lovely part of France, and two dishes that I just love: soupe au pistou and then chicken cooked on a rotisserie \u2013 and then I think it was lemon tart. Soupe au pistou is one of my favourite soups in the world. The first time I ever tasted basil was not in Italy but in France, in soup au pistou. This arrived in a big tureen, and gosh, was it good. It was in September, so all the ingredients were in season: courgettes, tomatoes, green beans, peas, basil, flageolets \u2013 and loads of garlic. The thing about food for me is it\u2019s really an ancillary to great conversation and great atmosphere; and that restaurant was buzzing, it was very nice to see John, and there was local ros\u00e9 to drink. It all reinforced my belief that good food in restaurants is about the craic; it\u2019s sort of an art form that, when it works, has the effect of so cheering you up it takes you out of the everyday minute details and performs an artistic magic on you. But the soupe au pistou was just the best thing I\u2019ve eaten for so long. </p> <h2>Alaskan king crab with salted duck-egg sauce at Dynasty Seafood Restaurant, Vancouver</h2> <p><em>Nisha Katona, founder and CEO</em><em>, Mowgli Street Food</em></p> <p>Over the summer I went to Vancouver, where there is an incredible Asian food scene. At the Dynasty Seafood Restaurant, which is <em>the</em> place for Chinese families in Vancouver to gather, I had deep-fried Alaskan king crab with salted duck-egg sauce. Salted duck-egg is kind of like the parmesan of the Far East; it\u2019s a phenomenal thing. They brine the eggs, steam them, then mash the yolks with butter, sugar, salt and rice wine, and so there\u2019s this sweet, salty, quite granular coating that makes you actually want to suck the crab shells more than eat the flesh. It really hurts me that salted duck-egg sauce hasn\u2019t made an impact in London, though I think its time is coming. We need to get behind salted duck-eggs. That sweet umami is the ultimate flavour hit. </p> <h2>Steamed fresh flowery crab with aged Shaoxing wine, fragrant chicken oil and flat rice noodles at the Chairman, Hong Kong</h2> <p><em>Tomos Parry, chef-founder, Brat, London</em></p> <p>At Brat, we cook whole fish and crabs, so when we went to Hong Kong I was interested to see how they did it. This dish is a flower crab cooked in Shaoxing wine, it has chicken oil through it and comes with thick steamed noodles. You eat the crab and it creates its own sauce for the noodles. Flower crabs don\u2019t really have the depth of flavour of the head meat of British native crabs; it\u2019s much sweeter and more delicate, but it worked. The balance was amazing. We also had a steamed grouper head with fermented chilli and Chinese pickled olives. It was kind of sticky and umami and spicy \u2013 these really complex flavours were so different to anything I\u2019d tried before. I\u2019d never been to Asia before, so it was quite an eye-opener. The Chairman is in the World\u2019s 50 Best list, but it\u2019s not fussy, it looks like a kind of restaurant you\u2019re quite familiar with. They have a lazy susan on the table. I grew up with pretty rubbish food on lazy susans, but here the sharing element all made sense. It was an exciting place to eat. </p> <h2>Smoked eel, apple, caviar and white chocolate at the Angel, Hetton, Yorkshire</h2> <p><em>Gareth Ward , chef-</em><em>owner, Ynyshir</em><em>, south Wales</em></p> <p>The Angel is a beautiful old pub in a village in west Yorkshire that\u2019s been taken over by Michael Wignall, who was previously at the Latymer and Gidleigh Park. I knew it would be good but I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be so incredible. He\u2019s quite complicated in the way he cooks, but he makes it all work. The smoked eel and white chocolate was a standout, along with a strawberries, sweet pea and olive oil cake for dessert. They\u2019ve just opened, so it\u2019s early days, but the future is going to be huge for them. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Potted shrimp, haddock and egg, sticky toffee pudding, Welsh rarebit \u2013 we rolled out after three hours</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Lunch at Sweetings, London</h2> <p><em>Melanie Arnold, co-owner, Rochelle Canteen, London</em></p> <p>I finally got to Sweetings. I\u2019d been meaning to go for years but when I\u2019d been before they were full and I could never sit down. It was a gorgeous sunny day, and I tripped down the street thinking \u201cooh, this is going to be fun.\u201d And it was just lovely. Lovely decor, shared tables, and nice old wait staff in waistcoats. I started with a black velvet in a tankard, standing at the bar. First we were given a little plate of pre-buttered sliced bread, which was quite a surprise. Then I had potted shrimps, then smoked haddock with poached egg. The service was great, and the hum all around. It\u2019s quite City, quite blokey, and they\u2019re all tucking in like crazy. There\u2019s a real vim and vigour about it. And, I don\u2019t want to be rude, the food was better than I thought it was going to be. I\u2019d thought the food wasn\u2019t really what you go for, but I really enjoyed it. It\u2019s not modern, but you get why City men love it. The haddock and egg was perfect. A nice bit of frozen peas on the side \u2013 I love frozen peas. Then we had sticky toffee pudding and custard, and then Welsh rarebit with a bit of poire William. We rolled out after a good two and a half, three hours. It was one of those early midweek, naughty lunches, when you\u2019re in high spirits right from the off. It felt like a real treat. </p> <h2>Tuna sandwich at Taberna Muguruza Ardoak, Pasaia, Spain</h2> <p><em>Fozia Ismail , food anthropologist and c</em><em>ook, Arawelo Eats, Bristol</em></p> <p>For our 10th wedding anniversary we went to San Sebasti\u00e1n, which is lovely and has amazing food. But we also did a walk of about eight miles to a fishing village called Pasaia. It\u2019s a beautiful coastal walk, but quite hard going \u2013 up and down \u2013 and when we got there we found this dive bar, like a workers\u2019 bar, full of old men drinking lots of coffee and smoking loads. They told us to take a ferry to the posher bit of the village. But we thought we\u2019d just stay there because they had lovely wine, and we had the nicest tuna sandwich. It was on ciabatta-like bread; really good quality tinned tuna with a mild pickled chilli and a green olive. So simple, so honest, so delicious. And it cost \u20ac2. We went back a couple of days later for another and the woman at the bar was lovely, but also like: \u201cWhat are you doing? This is not a tourist place? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d It was hilarious, and still brilliant. </p> <h2><strong>Vegetable and pork dumplings at </strong><strong>One Kueh at a Time, Singapore</strong></h2> <p><em>Mauro Colagreco, chef-</em><em>owner, Mirazur, France</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f8e8c7cca824b228474a1a74ae2cdb0e098e76f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8e8c7cca824b228474a1a74ae2cdb0e098e76f8/0_29_1157_1610/719.jpg\" alt=\"Vegetable and pork dumplings chosen by Mauro Colagreco.\" width=\"719\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vegetable and pork dumplings chosen by Mauro Colagreco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Lehel Kov\u00e1cs/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was in Singapore in June for the World\u2019s 50 Best awards [at which Mirazur was voted the world\u2019s best restaurant]. The chef Julien Royer, of Odette in Singapore, recommended I go to One Kueh at a Time, and I\u2019m very glad I did. It\u2019s a casual, family-run place that specialises in dumplings. I had two different fillings: one was beetroot and burnt cabbage, which was so nice; the other was pork and cabbage. I was totally impressed by the dumpling itself and by the texture of the filling. </p> <h2>Organic spring onions from Laos</h2> <p><em>Bounsou \u201cKing\u201d Senathit, chef-owner</em><em>, Cook</em><em>Daily, London</em></p> <p>Whenever my mum goes to Laos, she brings back amazing produce. In October, she came back with some very long, thin spring onions from the weekly organic market in the capital Vientiane \u2013 an incredible place, with loads of greens that I\u2019ve never seen. I used the whole, unchopped spring onions, tail and all, to make a Korean pancake, or pajeon. I topped it off with some other produce my mum had brought back, including cherry tomatoes and some really fragrant holy basil, and served it with a dipping sauce of sesame oil, soy sauce, fresh ginger and chilli. It was the best pancake I\u2019ve ever had because of those amazing spring onions. </p> <h2>Eggs at Niddo, Mexico City</h2> <p><em>Ruth Rogers, chef-owner, </em><em>the River Caf\u00e9, London</em></p> <p>I lived in Mexico for four months this year, and I love the way Mexicans eat: they have a big breakfast and a late lunch and not very much in the evening. For breakfast, I would walk to a wonderful, really exceptional cafe called Niddo not far from my house, run by a woman called Karen Drijanski. Every day I would have eggs with tortillas and a rich tomato sauce with chilli, or Mexicanos, or rancheros. If friends were visiting for the first time I\u2019d recommend they have chilaquiles \u2013 corn tortillas with either green or red sauce. Having that with really good coffee would start the day. </p> <h2>Summer squash and cod at SingleThread Farm Restaurant, California</h2> <p><em>Clare Smyth, chef-owner, Core, London</em></p> <p>I eat a lot of amazing food all over the world, so it\u2019s very rare to actually be stopped by something. But at SingleThread I was, by the summer squash with black cod \u2013 it was outstanding. Some of the squash was cooked very lightly in salted water; the fish was cooked on a little Japanese barbecue and had a light smoke to it; and tama miso, which is an egg-yolk miso sauce, bound it all in richness. There was raw squash and blossoms too, so it was also very pure. Ridiculously good. The next day I was walking in the gardens with Kyle Connaughton, the chef and owner of SingleThread, and he said: \u201cYou know, these squashes are in my favourite dish at the moment\u201d, so he knew that the produce was just absolutely at its peak. </p> <h2>D\u00e9nia prawns at Mar do Inferno, Cascais, Portugal</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5e90bc08d1fb8de996c0cee941e94a1f543be27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5e90bc08d1fb8de996c0cee941e94a1f543be27/1900_0_3072_3071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The best thing I ate all year illustrations 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">D\u00e9nia prawns chosen by Robin Gill</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Lehel Kov\u00e1cs/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Robin Gill , chef-owner, </em><em>the Dairy</em><em> and Darby\u2019s, both London</em></p> <p>On a trip to Lisbon in March, I had D\u00e9nia prawns at a traditional restaurant in Cascais, half an hour west of the city. They prepare these monstrous red prawns very simply, just grilled over fire with a decent pinch of salt and some olive oil, and they were outrageously good. You suck the juices out of the heads and that intense flavour was like a freight train hitting me in the face. My wife and my friend Dan\u2019s wife wouldn\u2019t eat the heads, so and Dan and I managed to get double for our money. We had the prawns with some vinho verde, the super-light Portuguese wine \u2013 breakfast wine, I was calling it. When I went to Lisbon again in September, I went back to the restaurant twice, so I\u2019ve had them three times this year. That\u2019s how good they are. </p> <h2>Post-flight pickles at Baoshuan, New Delhi</h2> <p><em>Andrew Wong, chef-owner, A Wong and Kym\u2019s, both London</em></p> <p>Before flying to New Delhi, where I\u2019m a mentor at Baoshuan, I gave the chef a brief: \u201cMake me some pickles.\u201d And when I arrived after a nine-hour flight, Chef Sun put out this array of pickles: all cold dishes, Chinese dishes; very traditional, but each one very different. Having been on a long flight, it was great to eat something healthy but so delicious. One was a lightly poached edamame bean with a spicy peanut-sesame dressing. Another was a traditional pickled chilli and black-bean cucumber. And he did this okra dish with a light dressing \u2013 just a little bit of vinegar, Sichuan pepper and sugar \u2013 but a weird texture. Traditionally, in most cuisines, they blanch okra in oil to stop you getting the slime, but Chef Sun explained that where he\u2019s from in China they blanch it in water because they want the slime. And then there were French beans that he had blanched in a star anise stock; it still looked like a simple raw bean, but so much flavour had infused into it. Utterly delicious. Chef Sun is from northern China but he\u2019s been working in India for two years and he\u2019s learned to use his roots, but pump everything with more umami because the Indian palate requires constant stimulation. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This tiny hawker stall is open from early until they sell out, normally about 9.30am</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Roti prata at Mr &amp; Mrs Mohgan\u2019s Super Crispy Roti Prata, Singapore</h2> <p><em>Elizabeth Haigh, chef</em><em>-founder</em><em>, Kaizen House</em><em> pop-ups</em></p> <p>We went to Singapore for a research trip combined with a family holiday and loads of people recommended Mr &amp; Mrs Mohgan\u2019s. We were staying next door, so we went for breakfast pretty much every morning. It\u2019s a tiny hawker stall that\u2019s open from early until they sell out, normally about 9.30am. There\u2019s a lady who writes every order by hand, then screams out the number when it\u2019s ready. The roti came with an amazingly rich mutton curry dish, perfect for waking you up, especially in that humidity. But the roti itself was the star of the show: it was so crispy and buttery and flaky. I loved just watching them making roti after roti in the background. The entire meal cost about \u00a32.30. You see people from all walks of life there, tourists and locals. </p> <h2>Picanha with chimichurri</h2> <p><em>Sheila Dillon, presenter, BBC Radio 4\u2019s </em><em> The Food Programme</em></p> <p>For a barbecue programme, we had on the three best barbecuers in Britain: DJ BBQ (Christian Stevenson), Samantha Evans from Hang Fire Southern Kitchen, and Genevieve Taylor who\u2019s written various books on barbecue. I\u2019ve always been sceptical about barbecues but this was one of the most magnificent feasts of my life. One of the two dishes that Sam cooked was a Brazilian cut of beef called picanha; we call it rump cover in this country but we don\u2019t really much eat it as a steak. It was a big piece of beef, much thicker than a steak \u2013 about two or three inches thick \u2013 from a Hereford that had been dry-aged for 28 days. She barbecued it as whole chunk of meat, then sliced it and gave it a final two or three minutes on the barbecue, and served it with a divine chimichurri sauce. That\u2019s a very simple thing, but it was utterly, completely wonderful. </p> <h2>Fried langoustine at Trattoria al Gatto Nero, Venice</h2> <p><em>Angela Hartnett, chef-owner, Caf</em><em>e Murano, London</em></p> <p>I\u2019d been to Gatto Nero a few times before, but this was a new thing I\u2019d tried. It was a langoustine, wrapped in lardo and then I think it was fried in a light batter, but it may have just been in flour. It was just so delicious. I was with my husband and another chef, and we all went: \u201cOh my God, isn\u2019t that amazing.\u201d When you taste something and you want another plate right away, you know they\u2019re onto something good. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A pure, pleasurable moment of eating with your hands</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Chicken millefeuille at Somni, Los Angeles</h2> <p><em>David Gelb, creator, Chef\u2019s Table</em></p> <p>Somni is a terrific restaurant by chef Aitor Zabala in collaboration with Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s. They do a tasting menu that is innovative but it doesn\u2019t sacrifice that for yumminess. Sometimes when you go for a tasting menu, lots of dishes are more interesting than delicious. Millefeuille is normally a dessert; in this case he makes it out of chicken. They do a chicken confit and then they roast the skin in a panini press. They layer this chicken skin and inside is chicken liver, Iberico ham, roasted onion puree, bacon Chantilly, rosemary powder and rosemary flowers. And it\u2019s just awesome. As I was crunching through the layers of chicken skin I was getting it on my hands, because some of the filling was coming out a little bit, and I see Aitor across the room and he looks at me and smiles and does a kind of \u201cyeah, you can lick your fingers\u201d gesture. It was a pure, pleasurable moment of eating with your hands.</p> <h2>Celeriac, mushrooms and egg yolk, Fitzroy, Fowey, Cornwall</h2> <p><em>Blanche Vaughan, cook and food writer</em></p> <p>My friends took me here. Fowey is a centuries-old harbour town and the restaurant is in an old bank. We ordered a bunch of dishes. The first two were so standout \u2013 there was lamb sweetbreads with crown prince pumpkin and crisp sage, and pollock croquettes with aioli \u2013 I thought I had eaten the best things I would all night. But then we had a dish of braised celeriac with mushrooms and an egg yolk. The celeriac was sliced very thinly like handkerchiefpasta \u2013 fazzoletti. It had the same texture as freshly cooked pasta too, a silkiness with a really subtle bite. The celeriac was infused with mushroom flavour and it turns out they had braised the celeriac in a mushroom broth. The mushrooms had been foraged in a secret spot near Bodmin. When the egg yolk was stirred into the dish, it became this wonderful creamy emulsion. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We come home with a suitcase of pecorino bought from the men on the beach</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Seadas in Oristano, Sardinia</h2> <p><em>Florence Knight, chef and food writer, London</em></p> <p>Seadas are my \u201cI\u2019m on holiday food\u201d, they remind me of sunshine. They are Sardinian pastries filled with young pecorino (aged to go a little acidic) and lemon zest, smothered in honey and often served on a piece of orange. They look a bit like those sweets, flying saucers. I first went to Sardinia because of Luca, who I know through Polpetto[where Knight was head chef]. I hired him as a chef when he spoke barely any English but I could tell his passion for food. When you cut seadas, pecorino oozes out. Pecorino is a Sardinian cheese and in Luca\u2019s town, Oristano, men try and sell you pecorino on the beach. They don\u2019t have a licence so they try and get you to go back to their vans where they have loads of vacuum-packed cheeses and sausages in the boot. We always come home with a massive suitcase. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6f00cb69f2a30caefe844dd18603f620331d74c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f00cb69f2a30caefe844dd18603f620331d74c9/0_0_1157_1444/801.jpg\" alt=\"Pecorino pastries chosen by Florence Knight.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pecorino pastries chosen by Florence Knight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Lehel Kov\u00e1cs/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Creme brulee at the Folkestone Wine Company, Kent</h2> <p><em>Neil Borthwick, head </em><em>chef</em><em>, </em><em>the French House, London</em></p> <p>Nowadays, nine out of 10 chefs cook creme brulee in a bain-marie in the oven with milk, whole eggs and what have you. But traditionally it\u2019s just cream, egg yolks and sugar cooked on the stove. It\u2019s a lot harder to do, but creme brulee should be made like this, it should be decadent. David Hart, the chef at the Folkestone Wine Company does it this way. I do too but I have to say there is something he does that makes them so nice and light. His had a beautifully caramelised-crunchy top and a lovely, rich custard underneath. Everyone around the table agreed it was just fantastic. It didn\u2019t last long, I don\u2019t think it will be taken off the menu any time soon. </p> <h2>Roasted monkfish with crispy garlic, Casa C\u00e1mara, San Sebasti\u00e1n</h2> <p><em>Dan Smith, chef patron, Fordwich Arms, Kent</em></p> <p>In August, we went to San Sebasti\u00e1n for our first wedding anniversary. We first went on holiday there about six years ago. Tash, my wife, who does all of the pastry at the Fordwich Arms, is pregnant and this was our last chance to get away before the baby. We have an emotional attachment, it\u2019s our place. We ate baby monkfish with crispy garlic at Casa C\u00e1mara, a family-run restaurant set into the side of the sea. There\u2019s a lobster cage on a wheelie system that drops down into the ocean. They bring the fish roasted whole to the table, it\u2019s incredible. The secret is in the emulsified oil with monkfish juice. </p> <h2>Brussels sprouts with caramelised lemons at Hapuku Lodge, Kaikoura, New Zealand</h2> <p><em>Ravinder Bhogal, chef-owner, Jikoni, London</em></p> <p>I just came back from New Zealand where I stayed at Hapuku Lodge on the South Island. We weren\u2019t expecting incredible food, because hotel food sometimes isn\u2019t the best, but we were completely blown away by the chef Fiona Read. I had really bad laryngitis and her food was just so healing and comforting. She\u2019s not trying to show off, but is just using whatever is available locally and it\u2019s all really delicious. Every day we ate amazing food, but one dish stood out, which was brussels sprouts cooked with a lemon puree. She cooked them perfectly \u2013 the outer leaves were slightly charred and the insides were soft but still had bite \u2013 and they were served with caramelised lemons and some seeds. It was really simple but utterly compelling eating \u2013 like eating a plate of sweets, you just can\u2019t stop. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Soupe au pistou at Le Bistrot du Paradou, France Rick Stein, chef and food writer My friend John Illsley, who was the bass guitarist in Dire Straits, recommended that we go to Le Bistrot du Paradou. The first thing I liked was that there was no choice on the menu: just one starter, one main course, one pud, and cheese. The menu changed every day. No choice, a very lovely part of France, and two dishes that I just love: soupe au pistou and then chicken cooked on a rotisserie \u2013 and then I think it was lemon tart. Soupe au pistou is one of my favourite soups in the world. The first time I ever tasted basil was not in Italy but in France, in soup au pistou. This arrived in a big tureen, and gosh, was it good. It was in September, so all the ingredients were in season: courgettes, tomatoes, green beans, peas, basil, flageolets \u2013 and loads of garlic. The thing about food for me is it\u2019s really an ancillary to great conversation and great atmosphere; and that restaurant was buzzing, it was very nice to see John, and there was local ros\u00e9 to drink. It all reinforced my belief that good food in restaurants is about the craic; it\u2019s sort of an art form that, when it works, has the effect of so cheering you up it takes you out of the everyday minute details and performs an artistic magic on you. But the soupe au pistou was just the best thing I\u2019ve eaten for so long. Alaskan king crab with salted duck-egg sauce at Dynasty Seafood Restaurant, Vancouver Nisha Katona, founder and CEO, Mowgli Street Food Over the summer I went to Vancouver, where there is an incredible Asian food scene. At the Dynasty Seafood Restaurant, which is the place for Chinese families in Vancouver to gather, I had deep-fried Alaskan king crab with salted duck-egg sauce. Salted duck-egg is kind of like the parmesan of the Far East; it\u2019s a phenomenal thing. They brine the eggs, steam them, then mash the yolks with butter, sugar, salt and rice wine, and so there\u2019s this sweet, salty, quite granular coating that makes you actually want to suck the crab shells more than eat the flesh. It really hurts me that salted duck-egg sauce hasn\u2019t made an impact in London, though I think its time is coming. We need to get behind salted duck-eggs. That sweet umami is the ultimate flavour hit. Steamed fresh flowery crab with aged Shaoxing wine, fragrant chicken oil and flat rice noodles at the Chairman, Hong Kong Tomos Parry, chef-founder, Brat, London At Brat, we cook whole fish and crabs, so when we went to Hong Kong I was interested to see how they did it. This dish is a flower crab cooked in Shaoxing wine, it has chicken oil through it and comes with thick steamed noodles. You eat the crab and it creates its own sauce for the noodles. Flower crabs don\u2019t really have the depth of flavour of the head meat of British native crabs; it\u2019s much sweeter and more delicate, but it worked. The balance was amazing. We also had a steamed grouper head with fermented chilli and Chinese pickled olives. It was kind of sticky and umami and spicy \u2013 these really complex flavours were so different to anything I\u2019d tried before. I\u2019d never been to Asia before, so it was quite an eye-opener. The Chairman is in the World\u2019s 50 Best list, but it\u2019s not fussy, it looks like a kind of restaurant you\u2019re quite familiar with. They have a lazy susan on the table. I grew up with pretty rubbish food on lazy susans, but here the sharing element all made sense. It was an exciting place to eat. Smoked eel, apple, caviar and white chocolate at the Angel, Hetton, Yorkshire Gareth Ward , chef-owner, Ynyshir, south Wales The Angel is a beautiful old pub in a village in west Yorkshire that\u2019s been taken over by Michael Wignall, who was previously at the Latymer and Gidleigh Park. I knew it would be good but I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be so incredible. He\u2019s quite complicated in the way he cooks, but he makes it all work. The smoked eel and white chocolate was a standout, along with a strawberries, sweet pea and olive oil cake for dessert. They\u2019ve just opened, so it\u2019s early days, but the future is going to be huge for them. Lunch at Sweetings, London Melanie Arnold, co-owner, Rochelle Canteen, London I finally got to Sweetings. I\u2019d been meaning to go for years but when I\u2019d been before they were full and I could never sit down. It was a gorgeous sunny day, and I tripped down the street thinking \u201cooh, this is going to be fun.\u201d And it was just lovely. Lovely decor, shared tables, and nice old wait staff in waistcoats. I started with a black velvet in a tankard, standing at the bar. First we were given a little plate of pre-buttered sliced bread, which was quite a surprise. Then I had potted shrimps, then smoked haddock with poached egg. The service was great, and the hum all around. It\u2019s quite City, quite blokey, and they\u2019re all tucking in like crazy. There\u2019s a real vim and vigour about it. And, I don\u2019t want to be rude, the food was better than I thought it was going to be. I\u2019d thought the food wasn\u2019t really what you go for, but I really enjoyed it. It\u2019s not modern, but you get why City men love it. The haddock and egg was perfect. A nice bit of frozen peas on the side \u2013 I love frozen peas. Then we had sticky toffee pudding and custard, and then Welsh rarebit with a bit of poire William. We rolled out after a good two and a half, three hours. It was one of those early midweek, naughty lunches, when you\u2019re in high spirits right from the off. It felt like a real treat. Tuna sandwich at Taberna Muguruza Ardoak, Pasaia, Spain Fozia Ismail , food anthropologist and cook, Arawelo Eats, Bristol For our 10th wedding anniversary we went to San Sebasti\u00e1n, which is lovely and has amazing food. But we also did a walk of about eight miles to a fishing village called Pasaia. It\u2019s a beautiful coastal walk, but quite hard going \u2013 up and down \u2013 and when we got there we found this dive bar, like a workers\u2019 bar, full of old men drinking lots of coffee and smoking loads. They told us to take a ferry to the posher bit of the village. But we thought we\u2019d just stay there because they had lovely wine, and we had the nicest tuna sandwich. It was on ciabatta-like bread; really good quality tinned tuna with a mild pickled chilli and a green olive. So simple, so honest, so delicious. And it cost \u20ac2. We went back a couple of days later for another and the woman at the bar was lovely, but also like: \u201cWhat are you doing? This is not a tourist place? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d It was hilarious, and still brilliant. Vegetable and pork dumplings at One Kueh at a Time, Singapore Mauro Colagreco, chef-owner, Mirazur, France I was in Singapore in June for the World\u2019s 50 Best awards [at which Mirazur was voted the world\u2019s best restaurant].

Eggs at Niddo, Mexico City Ruth Rogers, chef-owner, the River Caf\u00e9, London I lived in Mexico for four months this year, and I love the way Mexicans eat: they have a big breakfast and a late lunch and not very much in the evening. For breakfast, I would walk to a wonderful, really exceptional cafe called Niddo not far from my house, run by a woman called Karen Drijanski. Every day I would have eggs with tortillas and a rich tomato sauce with chilli, or Mexicanos, or rancheros. If friends were visiting for the first time I\u2019d recommend they have chilaquiles \u2013 corn tortillas with either green or red sauce. Having that with really good coffee would start the day.

Roti prata at Mr &amp; Mrs Mohgan\u2019s Super Crispy Roti Prata, Singapore Elizabeth Haigh, chef-founder, Kaizen House pop-ups We went to Singapore for a research trip combined with a family holiday and loads of people recommended Mr &amp; Mrs Mohgan\u2019s. We were staying next door, so we went for breakfast pretty much every morning. It\u2019s a tiny hawker stall that\u2019s open from early until they sell out, normally about 9.30am.

Picanha with chimichurri Sheila Dillon, presenter, BBC Radio 4\u2019s The Food Programme For a barbecue programme, we had on the three best barbecuers in Britain: DJ BBQ (Christian Stevenson), Samantha Evans from Hang Fire Southern Kitchen, and Genevieve Taylor who\u2019s written various books on barbecue. I\u2019ve always been sceptical about barbecues but this was one of the most magnificent feasts of my life. One of the two dishes that Sam cooked was a Brazilian cut of beef called picanha; we call it rump cover in this country but we don\u2019t really much eat it as a steak. It was a big piece of beef, much thicker than a steak \u2013 about two or three inches thick \u2013 from a Hereford that had been dry-aged for 28 days. She barbecued it as whole chunk of meat, then sliced it and gave it a final two or three minutes on the barbecue, and served it with a divine chimichurri sauce. That\u2019s a very simple thing, but it was utterly, completely wonderful. Fried langoustine at Trattoria al Gatto Nero, Venice Angela Hartnett, chef-owner, Cafe Murano, London I\u2019d been to Gatto Nero a few times before, but this was a new thing I\u2019d tried. It was a langoustine, wrapped in lardo and then I think it was fried in a light batter, but it may have just been in flour. It was just so delicious. I was with my husband and another chef, and we all went: \u201cOh my God, isn\u2019t that amazing.\u201d When you taste something and you want another plate right away, you know they\u2019re onto something good. Chicken millefeuille at Somni, Los Angeles David Gelb, creator, Chef\u2019s Table Somni is a terrific restaurant by chef Aitor Zabala in collaboration with Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s. They do a tasting menu that is innovative but it doesn\u2019t sacrifice that for yumminess. Sometimes when you go for a tasting menu, lots of dishes are more interesting than delicious. Millefeuille is normally a dessert; in this case he makes it out of chicken. They do a chicken confit and then they roast the skin in a panini press. They layer this chicken skin and inside is chicken liver, Iberico ham, roasted onion puree, bacon Chantilly, rosemary powder and rosemary flowers. And it\u2019s just awesome. As I was crunching through the layers of chicken skin I was getting it on my hands, because some of the filling was coming out a little bit, and I see Aitor across the room and he looks at me and smiles and does a kind of \u201cyeah, you can lick your fingers\u201d gesture. It was a pure, pleasurable moment of eating with your hands. Celeriac, mushrooms and egg yolk, Fitzroy, Fowey, Cornwall Blanche Vaughan, cook and food writer My friends took me here. Fowey is a centuries-old harbour town and the restaurant is in an old bank. We ordered a bunch of dishes. The first two were so standout \u2013 there was lamb sweetbreads with crown prince pumpkin and crisp sage, and pollock croquettes with aioli \u2013 I thought I had eaten the best things I would all night. But then we had a dish of braised celeriac with mushrooms and an egg yolk. The celeriac was sliced very thinly like handkerchiefpasta \u2013 fazzoletti. It had the same texture as freshly cooked pasta too, a silkiness with a really subtle bite. The celeriac was infused with mushroom flavour and it turns out they had braised the celeriac in a mushroom broth. The mushrooms had been foraged in a secret spot near Bodmin. When the egg yolk was stirred into the dish, it became this wonderful creamy emulsion. Seadas in Oristano, Sardinia Florence Knight, chef and food writer, London Seadas are my \u201cI\u2019m on holiday food\u201d, they remind me of sunshine. They are Sardinian pastries filled with young pecorino (aged to go a little acidic) and lemon zest, smothered in honey and often served on a piece of orange. They look a bit like those sweets, flying saucers. I first went to Sardinia because of Luca, who I know through Polpetto[where Knight was head chef]. I hired him as a chef when he spoke barely any English but I could tell his passion for food. When you cut seadas, pecorino oozes out. Pecorino is a Sardinian cheese and in Luca\u2019s town, Oristano, men try and sell you pecorino on the beach. They don\u2019t have a licence so they try and get you to go back to their vans where they have loads of vacuum-packed cheeses and sausages in the boot. We always come home with a massive suitcase. Creme brulee at the Folkestone Wine Company, Kent Neil Borthwick, head chef, the French House, London Nowadays, nine out of 10 chefs cook creme brulee in a bain-marie in the oven with milk, whole eggs and what have you. But traditionally it\u2019s just cream, egg yolks and sugar cooked on the stove. It\u2019s a lot harder to do, but creme brulee should be made like this, it should be decadent. David Hart, the chef at the Folkestone Wine Company does it this way. I do too but I have to say there is something he does that makes them so nice and light. His had a beautifully caramelised-crunchy top and a lovely, rich custard underneath. Everyone around the table agreed it was just fantastic. It didn\u2019t last long, I don\u2019t think it will be taken off the menu any time soon. Roasted monkfish with crispy garlic, Casa C\u00e1mara, San Sebasti\u00e1n Dan Smith, chef patron, Fordwich Arms, Kent In August, we went to San Sebasti\u00e1n for our first wedding anniversary. We first went on holiday there about six years ago. Tash, my wife, who does all of the pastry at the Fordwich Arms, is pregnant and this was our last chance to get away before the baby. We have an emotional attachment, it\u2019s our place. We ate baby monkfish with crispy garlic at Casa C\u00e1mara, a family-run restaurant set into the side of the sea. There\u2019s a lobster cage on a wheelie system that drops down into the ocean. They bring the fish roasted whole to the table, it\u2019s incredible. The secret is in the emulsified oil with monkfish juice. Brussels sprouts with caramelised lemons at Hapuku Lodge, Kaikoura, New Zealand Ravinder Bhogal, chef-owner, Jikoni, London I just came back from New Zealand where I stayed at Hapuku Lodge on the South Island. We weren\u2019t expecting incredible food, because hotel food sometimes isn\u2019t the best, but we were completely blown away by the chef Fiona Read. I had really bad laryngitis and her food was just so healing and comforting. She\u2019s not trying to show off, but is just using whatever is available locally and it\u2019s all really delicious. Every day we ate amazing food, but one dish stood out, which was brussels sprouts cooked with a lemon puree. She cooked them perfectly \u2013 the outer leaves were slightly charred and the insides were soft but still had bite \u2013 and they were served with caramelised lemons and some seeds. It was really simple but utterly compelling eating \u2013 like eating a plate of sweets, you just can\u2019t stop.",

It makes us look twice, listen hard, think again. It entertains and moves and asks us, in particular, to consider who owns the commentary about race (food for thought for every white theatre critic).</p> <p>Nadia Latif at no point loses her nerve, and directs with revolutionary relish and aplomb. Nicola Hughes\u2019s superb Beverly peels carrots with the best of them. Naana Agyei-Ampadu\u2019s Jasmine is gloriously watchable, especially when hilariously attempting to rearrange the precise alignment of her eyebrows in a mirror. Rhashan Stone charms as frisky Dayton, the boyish father, and Donna Banya\u2019s Keisha is a steadfast and persuasive presence, a young woman on the edge of change and at the helm of a work of dazzling and disconcerting originality.</p> <p>Entertainment does not come lighter than Sandy Wilson\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.menierchocolatefactory.com/Online/default.asp?doWork::WScontent::loadArticle=Load&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::article_id=CEE444BE-30A6-4B42-86A5-0E7ED72AEF98&amp;sessionlanguage=&amp;SessionSecurity::linkName=\" title=\"\">The Boy Friend</a></strong> (1954), with a plot as insubstantial as Twiggy, who played Polly Browne in Ken Russell\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcFQGy5plqI\" title=\"\">1971 film</a>. This delicious pastiche of a 1920s musical is set in a finishing school on the French Riviera, and asks not much more of its audience than a willingness to yield to a dazzling display of Charlestoning (if the verb is allowable).

      "bodyText": "A woman is peeling carrots in an immaculate house decorated in ice-cream shades: raspberry, vanilla. An L-shaped sofa with plumped-up cushions fills one corner of the stage. A birthday party is being prepared for Grandma, who is said to be upstairs. There is mildly amusing dialogue about celeriac, burnt cakes and the wrong cutlery. Fairview\u2019s author, Jackie Sibblies Drury, is at home with entertainingly stressful domesticity, and we are comfortable in her comfort zone (additional cosiness credit to designer Tom Scutt). We are, it seems, about to watch a tame comedy: an African American contribution to theatre\u2019s gone-wrong dinners and birthday parties with varied menus by Harold Pinter, Mike Leigh and Shakespeare. But the party at Fairview is different again. To say how different would be to give too much away, but do not allow yourself to be lulled by the play\u2019s bland, suburban title. The winner of the 2019 Pulitzer prize for drama, Fairview persistently pulls the carpet out from under us. It is to drama what Claudia Rankine\u2019s outstanding writing is to poetry. It makes us look twice, listen hard, think again. It entertains and moves and asks us, in particular, to consider who owns the commentary about race (food for thought for every white theatre critic). Nadia Latif at no point loses her nerve, and directs with revolutionary relish and aplomb. Nicola Hughes\u2019s superb Beverly peels carrots with the best of them. Naana Agyei-Ampadu\u2019s Jasmine is gloriously watchable, especially when hilariously attempting to rearrange the precise alignment of her eyebrows in a mirror. Rhashan Stone charms as frisky Dayton, the boyish father, and Donna Banya\u2019s Keisha is a steadfast and persuasive presence, a young woman on the edge of change and at the helm of a work of dazzling and disconcerting originality.

In Austria, however, the figure of the Krampus has been part of pre-Christmas folklore for centuries, with men in costumes roaming the streets to scare children and grownups from the end of November to the middle of December. Yet in recent years the Krampus has developed to become an altogether very modern bogeyman, with a rising number of complaints about the demons acting in a drunkenly and disorderly fashion once they have donned their fearsome masks. In Carinthia, police recorded a number of violent incidents this year in the run-up to the official \u201cKrampus day\u201d on 5 December, with one person being hit in the face with a birch and an 11-year-old child being left with bloody cut on their thigh. In Klagenfurt, in Carinthia, the fire brigade complained that two of firefighters were set upon and beaten by a group of Krampuses, while in Salzburg last Sunday police were called out to deal with a number of drunken devils in the city centre. A video of Thursday\u2019s Krampus run in Sterzing in South Tyrol, on the Italian side of the border, shows spectators fleeing in panic as a group of devils start to beat and kick a person lying on the ground. In the town of Neumarkt in Lower Austria, a man dressed as a Percht, an Alpine pagan goddess, sustained severe neck injuries when a spectator yanked his mask by the horns. In Schwoich in the Tyrol region, three Krampuses set their costumes on fire and suffered burns after accidentally setting off a box of fireworks. According to Peter Wiesflecker, a historian of Austrian culture and customs, the spike in the number of complaints can be explained by how the cult of the Krampus has evolved into a mass spectacle. In its original form, Wiesflecker argues, Krampus was not so much a standalone devil figure but a domesticated sidekick of Sankt Nikolaus, the Father Christmas-like character who gifts German and Austrian children with presents on 6 December. In the 19th century, evil Krampus spirits began to accompany Sankt Nikolaus impersonators on home visits and would sometimes cross the threshold to scare children, but their anarchic energy was usually restrained and controlled by the benign man with the bushy white beard. Fuelled by political support for distinctly Austrian folk customs, Krampus began to emancipate from his master in the late 20th century, and in recent years the appetite for large-scale \u201cKrampus runs\u201d has grown across Austria: at an event Salzburg on 23 November this year, about 1,000 goat-demons roamed the streets of the city. Attempts to impose order on the chaos by assigning each Krampus with a starting number and setting up barriers between the evil spirits and spectators have not always been successful. An alcohol ban has also been difficult to enforce. \u201cIf large group of young men in masks roamed the streets on any other night of the year, the police would be called out in an instant,\u201d said Wiesflecker. \u201cIn an anonymous collective, we are always more likely to overstep our boundaries.\u201d Even smaller, more traditional Krampus associations have begun to enforce a codex that devil-impersonators are advised to follow. \u201cKrampus is meant to make spectators\u2019 skin crawl with his appearance and movement \u2013 not cause fear or even panic,\u201d state the guidelines issued by the Krampus association in the municipality of Anif, in Salzburg state.

      "body": "<p>Few actors could be said to have dominated a year as much as Adam Driver. The 36-year-old began 2019 with a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for <em>BlacKkKlansman</em> and will end it as the star of three of the year\u2019s most talked-about movies \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/17/the-report-review-adam-driver-annette-bening\" title=\"\"><em>The Report</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/22/the-final-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-trailer-kylo-ren-palpatine-c3po-jannah-rey\" title=\"\"><em>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/15/marriage-story-review-noah-baumbach-adam-driver-scarlett-johansson\" title=\"\"><em>Marriage Story</em></a>.</p> <p>In the months between, he has won rave reviews for his performance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/16/burn-this-review-adam-driver-keri-russell\" title=\"\"><em>Burn This</em></a> on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination (he missed out to Bryan Cranston), and been the focus of a series of adoring profiles. An article in the <em>New Yorker</em> alluding to <em>Girls</em>, the TV show that made Driver\u2019s name, branded him the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/28/adam-driver-the-original-man\" title=\"\">\u201cOriginal Man\u201d</a>.</p> <p>But none of this has happened by chance. Over the past six years, Driver, who has been compared to the great actors of the 70s from Robert De Niro to Dustin Hoffman, has been sought out by some of the world\u2019s most celebrated directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Soderbergh, the Coen brothers, Jim Jarmusch, Noah Baumbach and Spike Lee. Scorsese called him \u201cone of the finest, if not the finest [actor] of his generation\u201d. Lee kept it simpler still, saying he cast Driver in <em>BlacKkKlansman</em> because \u201cgame respects game\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c7570299e9244e623050866d24fc3217f729d93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c7570299e9244e623050866d24fc3217f729d93/0_62_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Driver on set with director Spike Lee and Topher Grace for BlacKkKlansman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Driver on set with director Spike Lee and Topher Grace for BlacKkKlansman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor does it hurt that those glowing magazine profiles have a propensity for shooting him with his shirt off. An infamous Annie Leibovitz shoot for <em>Vogue</em> in 2013 saw him<a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/things-you-didnt-know-adam-driver-star-wars-logan-lucky\" title=\"\"> topless with a goat</a> draped around his neck, his pecs appeal is regularly debated online while a writer on US website the Cut became \u201cso flustered by his quads [in <em>Burn This</em>] that \u2026 I spilled all of the contents of my purse on the floor\u201d. No wonder then that he is increasingly hailed as Hollywood\u2019s latest, if most unlikely, heartthrob.</p> <p>Not that Driver sees it that way. Instead, he has repeatedly stressed he has no interest in being a sex symbol, has no social media awareness and had no desire to court the kind of celebrity that a rapid rise to the Hollywood A-list brings.</p> <p>He has described himself as a very \u201cNew York actor\u201d, lives a low-key life in Brooklyn with his wife of six years, Joanne Tucker, and their son, and is increasingly picky about the work he accepts. \u201cThe stakes are different. It really has to be worth it, because you have to be gone a lot,\u201d he told <em>Rolling Stone</em> this month.</p> <p>That\u2019s true to an extent. But, as with most things involving Driver, there is an interesting ambiguity at play. Thus he might not wish to be seen as a heartthrob but he has never shied away from those close-ups of the hyper-buff, 6ft 2in body he first honed as a young man in the US Marines.</p> <p>That earlier career intrigues too. Driver has talked openly of the fact that he signed up to serve in the military after 9/11. admitting that \u201cI was not thinking of politics at all. That enemy was faceless in my mind \u2026 I put my faith in institutions. I wasn\u2019t until later in life that I had perspective.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b5edd24b58e2458bacf47e7a4c33b717d438d73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b5edd24b58e2458bacf47e7a4c33b717d438d73/717_179_2561_1537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Driver is Kylo Ren in Star Wars: the Rise of Skywalker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Driver is Kylo Ren in Star Wars: the Rise of Skywalker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucasfilm Ltd.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in San Diego, Driver\u2019s family moved to Mishawaka, Indiana, following his parent\u2019s divorce, a difficult experience which the actor has admitted he drew on for his performance in <em>Marriage Story</em> if only because that film\u2019s protagonist, Charlie, behaves in the opposite way to his own father, fighting for custody and making every effort to stay in his young son\u2019s life.</p> <p>His mother\u2019s second marriage to a Baptist preacher saw the young Driver increasingly rebelling against his upbringing. He chafed against the restrictions of the church, dreamed vaguely of becoming an actor and hung out with a similarly bored group of friends making camcorder action movies.</p> <p>Throughout all the teenage ennui, he watched movies made by the likes of Scorsese, Jarmusch and David Fincher, which told stories that challenged him and suggested that there was another world. \u201cThe first time I saw it I felt kind of sick,\u201d he would later say of Fincher\u2019s <em>Fight Club</em>. \u201cIt made me feel very strange. But then I watched it again almost immediately.\u201d</p> <p>Having repeatedly bristled against the authority of religion, he embraced the discipline of the marines, only for his career to end in an early discharge following an injury sustained while off-duty.

      "bodyText": "Few actors could be said to have dominated a year as much as Adam Driver. The 36-year-old began 2019 with a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for BlacKkKlansman and will end it as the star of three of the year\u2019s most talked-about movies \u2013 The Report, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Marriage Story. In the months between, he has won rave reviews for his performance in Burn This on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination (he missed out to Bryan Cranston), and been the focus of a series of adoring profiles. An article in the New Yorker alluding to Girls, the TV show that made Driver\u2019s name, branded him the \u201cOriginal Man\u201d. But none of this has happened by chance. Over the past six years, Driver, who has been compared to the great actors of the 70s from Robert De Niro to Dustin Hoffman, has been sought out by some of the world\u2019s most celebrated directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Soderbergh, the Coen brothers, Jim Jarmusch, Noah Baumbach and Spike Lee. Scorsese called him \u201cone of the finest, if not the finest [actor] of his generation\u201d. Lee kept it simpler still, saying he cast Driver in BlacKkKlansman because \u201cgame respects game\u201d. Nor does it hurt that those glowing magazine profiles have a propensity for shooting him with his shirt off. An infamous Annie Leibovitz shoot for Vogue in 2013 saw him topless with a goat draped around his neck, his pecs appeal is regularly debated online while a writer on US website the Cut became \u201cso flustered by his quads [in Burn This] that \u2026 I spilled all of the contents of my purse on the floor\u201d. No wonder then that he is increasingly hailed as Hollywood\u2019s latest, if most unlikely, heartthrob. Not that Driver sees it that way. Instead, he has repeatedly stressed he has no interest in being a sex symbol, has no social media awareness and had no desire to court the kind of celebrity that a rapid rise to the Hollywood A-list brings. He has described himself as a very \u201cNew York actor\u201d, lives a low-key life in Brooklyn with his wife of six years, Joanne Tucker, and their son, and is increasingly picky about the work he accepts. \u201cThe stakes are different. It really has to be worth it, because you have to be gone a lot,\u201d he told Rolling Stone this month. That\u2019s true to an extent. But, as with most things involving Driver, there is an interesting ambiguity at play. Thus he might not wish to be seen as a heartthrob but he has never shied away from those close-ups of the hyper-buff, 6ft 2in body he first honed as a young man in the US Marines. That earlier career intrigues too. Driver has talked openly of the fact that he signed up to serve in the military after 9/11. admitting that \u201cI was not thinking of politics at all. That enemy was faceless in my mind \u2026 I put my faith in institutions. I wasn\u2019t until later in life that I had perspective.\u201d Born in San Diego, Driver\u2019s family moved to Mishawaka, Indiana, following his parent\u2019s divorce, a difficult experience which the actor has admitted he drew on for his performance in Marriage Story if only because that film\u2019s protagonist, Charlie, behaves in the opposite way to his own father, fighting for custody and making every effort to stay in his young son\u2019s life. His mother\u2019s second marriage to a Baptist preacher saw the young Driver increasingly rebelling against his upbringing. He chafed against the restrictions of the church, dreamed vaguely of becoming an actor and hung out with a similarly bored group of friends making camcorder action movies. Throughout all the teenage ennui, he watched movies made by the likes of Scorsese, Jarmusch and David Fincher, which told stories that challenged him and suggested that there was another world. \u201cThe first time I saw it I felt kind of sick,\u201d he would later say of Fincher\u2019s Fight Club. \u201cIt made me feel very strange. But then I watched it again almost immediately.\u201d Having repeatedly bristled against the authority of religion, he embraced the discipline of the marines, only for his career to end in an early discharge following an injury sustained while off-duty. At a loose end again, he decided to take another chance on those acting dreams (an early audition at 17 had come to nothing), trying out for the prestigious Julliard school in New York. He was accepted \u2013 and became notorious for five-mile runs to college and endless push-ups in the hallways. And there was no holding back his talent. In Girls, his Adam Sackler could have been the archetypal bad boyfriend, a man with a propensity for pushing sexual boundaries while avoiding commitment. Yet Driver gave him a desperate yearning that transformed the character into something far more interesting. Similarly in Jarmusch\u2019s Paterson, his titular character commands the screen while barely uttering a word, his stillness creating an almost claustrophobic intimacy. Alongside the intriguing vulnerability that drives his best performances is an impressive versatility. He has convinced as a doubting Jesuit priest in Scorsese\u2019s Silence, as a goofy Jewish police officer in BlacKkKlansman and as the needy Kylo Ren in the Star Wars saga, a bravura turn which leaves you pitying a villain as much as despising him. In Marriage Story, an updated Kramer vs Kramer which follows playwright Charlie and his actor wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) as their marriage disintegrates, he delivers a performance both incredibly precise and beautifully loose, his heartbreaking performance of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Being Alive arguably the cinematic moment of the year. Far more than a pretty chest then, even if Driver remains agnostic about his success: \u201cDoubt is part of being committed to something,\u201d he told the New Yorker. \u201cI feel that with religion. I feel that with acting. I feel that with marriage. I feel that with being a parent. I\u2019m constantly filled with doubt, regardless of what I\u2019ve accomplished \u2026 You still don\u2019t know anything really.\u201d",

It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d On checks on goods heading into the Republic of Ireland and therefore the EU, Johnson said: \u201cSo the issue is how to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland and we can do that by making sure that there are \u2013 by having some checks on goods that might be proceeding into the Republic.\u201d Labour revealed on Thursday that the Treasury documents suggested there would be at the very least exit summary declarations when goods are exported from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, \u201cin order to meet EU obligations\u201d. A section headed \u201ceconomic impact on Northern Ireland\u201d suggests high street goods are \u201clikely to increase in price\u201d, and many exporters could struggle with the costs of disruptive border checks. On his \u201cAustralian-style, points-based\u201d immigration system, Johnson said immigrants would be sorted into three categories: those with exceptional talent, skilled workers, and a group who will not have the right to stay but will be allowed in to do time-limited specific jobs. He said he wanted to \u201cbear down\u201d on unskilled migration and there would be lower levels of immigration after Brexit. Johnson refused to say whether he would resign if he failed to win a majority at the general election on Thursday. The prime minister\u2019s decision to call the snap vote could hand Jeremy Corbyn the keys to No 10 \u2013 making Johnson one of the shortest-serving leaders in British history. He said he would not be drawn on his political future when asked three times if he would stand down if he failed to secure a majority. Johnson admitted he was nervous and \u201cfighting for every vote\u201d. On his manifesto promise to deliver 50,000 more nurses, he said there would be 31,000 new posts.",

Once internationally feted as a human rights champion, Myanmar\u2019s state counsellor is scheduled to lead a delegation to the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague. The claim that Myanmar\u2019s military carried out mass murder, rape and destruction of Rohingya Muslim communities has been brought by the Gambia, a west African state that belongs to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The contrast is repeatedly drawn between Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s 1991 peace prize win and 15 years spent under house arrest, and her present position as chief denier that any ethnic violence has been perpetrated against the Rohingya. Last year, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum revoked her Elie Wiesel award. Security around the court is expected to be tight. There has been speculation that undisclosed arrest warrants may have been issued in relation to other legal proceedings against Myanmar.

It is not the first time the tribunal, also known as the world court, has considered genocide cases \u2013 it dealt with several from the Balkan wars of the 1990s \u2013 but it is the first case involving countries that are not neighbours. The three-day hearing in the neo-Renaissance-style Peace Palace is what is known as a provisional measures procedure. The Gambia will urge the court to make an emergency declaration that Myanmar must halt a continuing genocide, and the court will consider whether it has jurisdiction and whether there is a plausible case to answer. This preliminary phase of the claim will not involve personal testimony from any of the estimated 700,000 Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh after the start of what are alleged to have been military clearance operations. The Gambia\u2019s submission states: \u201cThe genocidal acts committed during these operations were intended to destroy the Rohingya as a group, in whole or in part, by the use of mass murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, as well as the systematic destruction by fire of their villages, often with inhabitants locked inside burning houses.\u201d Its arguments rely on the findings of UN investigations that described \u201cgenocidal intent\u201d in the crimes. The UN special rapporteur Yanghee Lee related first-hand accounts of \u201cattacks in which homes were set ablaze by security forces, in many cases with people trapped inside, and entire villages razed to the ground\u201d.

Among the country\u2019s Buddhist majority, she retains overwhelming support. The international criminal court (ICC), elsewhere in The Hague, has launched a separate investigation into alleged crimes against humanity committed by Myanmar\u2019s leaders in forcibly deporting hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees to neighbouring Bangladesh.

      "body": "<p>Patrick Wilson\u2019s* heavy eyelids drop momentarily as he parks on a steep terraced street on the suburban edges of north Bristol. He raises a fist to cover a deep, primal yawn that makes his whole body shudder with exhaustion. He has been on the go since 7.30am, when he filled every bit of free space in his battered VW people carrier with packages and bags from the likes of Amazon, M&amp;S and Next. He hasn\u2019t had time to take a break or go to the toilet and it\u2019s now nearly 3pm.</p> <p>\u201cI picked up 220 parcels in the morning,\u201d he says, examining the chunky GPS device that records and dictates his every move. \u201cI\u2019ve done 77 but I\u2019ve got 143 left. That\u2019s a lot.\u201d</p> <p>As the 46-year-old takes the next tranche of parcels in his arms, his mobile buzzes in the pocket of his jeans. It\u2019s the delivery company office. Although he is supposedly self-employed and running his own business, his employer is constantly monitoring him. \u201cShe wants to know if I can make all the deliveries today,\u201d Wilson says wearily. \u201cThey have a graph on their computers that shows how you are doing. They are always watching. Whatever you are doing, someone in the office is checking.\u201d</p> <p>This is the gruelling reality behind the multibillion-pound festive spending spree which, up and down the country, is now in full swing. Lured by the seductive promise of same- and next-day delivery, increasing numbers of consumers shop online for apparent bargains from the season\u2019s super-hyped opener, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/16/black-friday-good-deals-amazon-fire-7-google-home-mini\" title=\"\">Black Friday</a>, through to the looming Christmas bonanza.</p> <p>Amazon UK has reported that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/29/mass-consumerism-black-friday-climate-catastrophe-consumption-shopping\" title=\"\">Black Friday </a>the week before last was its busiest day of the year, with millions of users ordering everything from smart speakers to TV streaming devices to the latest tablets.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/02/uk-retailers-outstanding-black-friday-sales\" title=\"\">Figures compiled last week by Barclays</a>, which processes \u00a31 of every \u00a33 spent in the UK, shows the value of transactions was up 16.5% on the previous Black Friday, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/26/what-is-black-friday-biggest-uk-shopping-day\" title=\"\">unknown in this country until </a> when the idea was imported from the US.</p> <p>For millions of people, the run-up to Christmas is now indelibly associated with gifts left in doorways, behind bins and nestling in hedges. However, the estimated 35,000 drivers and couriers rushing these purchases to our homes have little to celebrate.</p> <p>According to the GMB union, three-quarters are self-employed \u2013 a complete reversal of the situation in the early 2000s when most drivers were directly employed by the likes of Royal Mail. These days, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/couriers-delivery\" title=\"\">courier companies</a> expect drivers to use their own vehicles and pay their own maintenance and fuel costs. The drivers do not have any rights to sick or holiday pay, or any protection against unfair dismissal. If illness or hospital appointments prevent them working, they do not get paid. If they fall while unloading, or crash while rushing to meet their punishing schedules, it\u2019s their problem.</p> <p>Mick Rix, who organises thousands of couriers for the GMB, claims this race to the bottom is being driven by brutal cost-cutting by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/22/union-stages-final-protest-over-horrific-amazon-work-practices\" title=\"\">online behemoth Amazon</a>. \u201cIt has been driving down costs in the delivery sector for a long time now. The main courier companies have responding by squeezing the pay of directly employed workers and using more self-employed drivers.\u201d Amazon disputes this. \u201cNo evidence has been provided to support this unsubstantiated allegation,\u201d said a spokesperson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a59f1b2660faebf40c47fa66c8753f4f15ac8f03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a59f1b2660faebf40c47fa66c8753f4f15ac8f03/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon parcels ready for dispatch on Black Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon parcels ready for dispatch on Black Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although parcel volumes are growing in the UK, prices overall are going down. Ofcom figures show parcel volumes increased by 11% last year, while the average paid per item decreased by 5% \u2013 from \u00a34.19 in 2016-17 to \u00a33.98 in 2017-18.</p> <p>Rix argues the industry is built on bogus self-employment. \u201cThe majority of the couriers are working five or six days a week. They are wearing a uniform. They are under the direction and control of an app. They are virtually the same as a directly employed worker \u2013 other than that all the risks are transferred to them.\u201d</p> <p>Unions, including the GMB and the <a href=\"https://iwgb.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Independent Workers Union of Great Britain</a>, have won a string of high-profile cases against gig-economy employers since 2012. Last year an employment tribunal ruled that a group of self-employed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/04/hermes-to-offer-gig-economy-drivers-better-rights-under-union-deal\" title=\"\">Hermes couriers</a> were, in fact, workers entitled to basic employment rights such as minimum wage and holiday pay, rather than independent contractors. It follows similar judgments against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/25/uber-loses-licence-london-tfl\" title=\"\">Uber</a>, Addison Lee, City Sprint, Excel and e-Courier.</p> <p>Yet it has not led to a sea change in the industry because companies have not applied tribunal decisions to other workers and decisions have been repeatedly challenged. Uber is currently appealing against a ruling giving its drivers basic employment rights in the supreme court, with a decision expected next year.</p> <p>Rix says the burden of proof should be pushed on to companies. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be up to individuals and unions like ourselves to fund expensive litigation against companies that are worth billions of pounds. The dial should be switched so the companies should have to prove couriers are not directly employed.\u201d</p> <p>Unions such as the GMB would like to see a single status for all workers, rather than the current three ambiguous and sometimes overlapping categories, ranging from self-employment to direct employment. Labour has pledged to make these changes, leaving only those genuinely running their own businesses classed as self-employed. But the government\u2019s Good Work plan, which was alluded to in the last Queen\u2019s Speech before the election, merely seeks to clarify the difference between the self-employed and workers with minimal rights.</p> <p>In the south-east of Bristol, another self-employed driver is finishing a punishing non-stop 12-hour shift. Andrei Barbu has been on the road since 9am and now it\u2019s 9pm.

His supervisors expect him to make deliveries in nearly all circumstances as redeliveries are expensive and time-consuming for the company, which only receives a set fee for each package. \u201cToday I went to a farm with an electric gate.

I was really bad,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you can\u2019t afford to be off, you just have to do it.\u201d</p> <p>This can be a life-and-death matter.

According to his widow, Lane was worried about being fined if he did not cover his round in Dorset. His story partly inspired Ken Loach\u2019s latest film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/03/sorry-we-missed-you-review-ken-loach\" title=\"\"><em>Sorry </em><em>We Missed You</em></a>, which depicts the impact of the gig economy on a struggling working-class family.</p> <p>Barbu hasn\u2019t witnessed anything quite that extreme but he knows of drivers who work well over the six-day limit. \u201cThey say it is illegal to work seven days but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t put you under a different name and send you out. We had cases where people worked for more than 21 days in a row,\u201d he claims.</p> <p>If true, this is a dangerous ruse. Research by UCL has revealed that gig-economy drivers and riders are at heightened risk of traffic collisions, with 63% not receiving any safety training and two in five reporting collisions.</p> <p>The costs of self-employment soon eat up the money that initially attracts many to the industry. \u201cI can earn \u00a3120 a day but you have to deduct your fuel, and if your van breaks down you have to pay,\u201d says Barbu. \u201cYou end up getting the minimum wage for doing very hard work.\u201d</p> <p>Those who have to rent vans from courier firms for around \u00a3250 to \u00a3350 a week struggle to afford rents in the city. \u201cPeople used to sleep in the vans in the Bristol depot. I knew at least four people in the back car park,\u201d he says. Rix says some couriers need to claim benefits when times are lean. \u201cThere are couriers struggling to pay the rent, struggling to feed their families, using food banks and relying on benefits. Why should the taxpayer be subsidising these wealthy companies by paying in-work benefits?\u201d</p> <p>One hour later his colleague Daniel Eder arrives at his home elsewhere in the city. He has worked for 10 hours and travelled more than 200 miles.

      "bodyText": "Patrick Wilson\u2019s* heavy eyelids drop momentarily as he parks on a steep terraced street on the suburban edges of north Bristol. He raises a fist to cover a deep, primal yawn that makes his whole body shudder with exhaustion. He has been on the go since 7.30am, when he filled every bit of free space in his battered VW people carrier with packages and bags from the likes of Amazon, M&amp;S and Next. He hasn\u2019t had time to take a break or go to the toilet and it\u2019s now nearly 3pm. \u201cI picked up 220 parcels in the morning,\u201d he says, examining the chunky GPS device that records and dictates his every move. \u201cI\u2019ve done 77 but I\u2019ve got 143 left. That\u2019s a lot.\u201d As the 46-year-old takes the next tranche of parcels in his arms, his mobile buzzes in the pocket of his jeans. It\u2019s the delivery company office. Although he is supposedly self-employed and running his own business, his employer is constantly monitoring him. \u201cShe wants to know if I can make all the deliveries today,\u201d Wilson says wearily. \u201cThey have a graph on their computers that shows how you are doing. They are always watching. Whatever you are doing, someone in the office is checking.\u201d This is the gruelling reality behind the multibillion-pound festive spending spree which, up and down the country, is now in full swing. Lured by the seductive promise of same- and next-day delivery, increasing numbers of consumers shop online for apparent bargains from the season\u2019s super-hyped opener, Black Friday, through to the looming Christmas bonanza. Amazon UK has reported that Black Friday the week before last was its busiest day of the year, with millions of users ordering everything from smart speakers to TV streaming devices to the latest tablets. Figures compiled last week by Barclays, which processes \u00a31 of every \u00a33 spent in the UK, shows the value of transactions was up 16.5% on the previous Black Friday, which was unknown in this country until when the idea was imported from the US. For millions of people, the run-up to Christmas is now indelibly associated with gifts left in doorways, behind bins and nestling in hedges. However, the estimated 35,000 drivers and couriers rushing these purchases to our homes have little to celebrate. According to the GMB union, three-quarters are self-employed \u2013 a complete reversal of the situation in the early 2000s when most drivers were directly employed by the likes of Royal Mail. These days, courier companies expect drivers to use their own vehicles and pay their own maintenance and fuel costs. The drivers do not have any rights to sick or holiday pay, or any protection against unfair dismissal. If illness or hospital appointments prevent them working, they do not get paid. If they fall while unloading, or crash while rushing to meet their punishing schedules, it\u2019s their problem. Mick Rix, who organises thousands of couriers for the GMB, claims this race to the bottom is being driven by brutal cost-cutting by the online behemoth Amazon. \u201cIt has been driving down costs in the delivery sector for a long time now. The main courier companies have responding by squeezing the pay of directly employed workers and using more self-employed drivers.\u201d Amazon disputes this. \u201cNo evidence has been provided to support this unsubstantiated allegation,\u201d said a spokesperson. Although parcel volumes are growing in the UK, prices overall are going down. Ofcom figures show parcel volumes increased by 11% last year, while the average paid per item decreased by 5% \u2013 from \u00a34.19 in 2016-17 to \u00a33.98 in 2017-18. Rix argues the industry is built on bogus self-employment. \u201cThe majority of the couriers are working five or six days a week. They are wearing a uniform. They are under the direction and control of an app. They are virtually the same as a directly employed worker \u2013 other than that all the risks are transferred to them.\u201d Unions, including the GMB and the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, have won a string of high-profile cases against gig-economy employers since 2012. Last year an employment tribunal ruled that a group of self-employed Hermes couriers were, in fact, workers entitled to basic employment rights such as minimum wage and holiday pay, rather than independent contractors. It follows similar judgments against Uber, Addison Lee, City Sprint, Excel and e-Courier. Yet it has not led to a sea change in the industry because companies have not applied tribunal decisions to other workers and decisions have been repeatedly challenged. Uber is currently appealing against a ruling giving its drivers basic employment rights in the supreme court, with a decision expected next year. Rix says the burden of proof should be pushed on to companies. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be up to individuals and unions like ourselves to fund expensive litigation against companies that are worth billions of pounds. The dial should be switched so the companies should have to prove couriers are not directly employed.\u201d Unions such as the GMB would like to see a single status for all workers, rather than the current three ambiguous and sometimes overlapping categories, ranging from self-employment to direct employment. Labour has pledged to make these changes, leaving only those genuinely running their own businesses classed as self-employed. But the government\u2019s Good Work plan, which was alluded to in the last Queen\u2019s Speech before the election, merely seeks to clarify the difference between the self-employed and workers with minimal rights. In the south-east of Bristol, another self-employed driver is finishing a punishing non-stop 12-hour shift. Andrei Barbu has been on the road since 9am and now it\u2019s 9pm. He has dropped off 284 parcels for a subcontractor used by a major retailer, which sends out between 50,000 and 65,000 packages every day from its regional depot. \u201cWe are treated like slaves,\u201d he says in his van on the way home. \u201cI literally haven\u2019t eaten all day.\u201d The 26-year-old can\u2019t afford to take any breaks. \u201cYou have to use your vehicle as a toilet. You have to wee in bottles and poo in bags \u2013 it\u2019s humiliating,\u201d he says, with an understandable anger at the indignity inflicted on him and his fellow workers. \u201cYou get told off by your manager if you go to a petrol station with an actual toilet. They say \u2018why are you wasting half an hour?\u2019\u201d The pressure is relentless throughout the day, Barbu says. His supervisors expect him to make deliveries in nearly all circumstances as redeliveries are expensive and time-consuming for the company, which only receives a set fee for each package. \u201cToday I went to a farm with an electric gate. I had to walk all the way to the farmhouse and a German Shepherd attacked me,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to climb on top of the porch to get away.\u201d Like all self-employed drivers, Barbu is not entitled to sick pay. This means he frequently works when he is ill. \u201cOne day I had really bad toothache. My face was swollen. I couldn\u2019t swallow and I had a fever. I was really bad,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you can\u2019t afford to be off, you just have to do it.\u201d This can be a life-and-death matter. Last year a self-employed courier, Don Lane, died after missing appointments with diabetic specialists and working through the Christmas period. According to his widow, Lane was worried about being fined if he did not cover his round in Dorset. His story partly inspired Ken Loach\u2019s latest film Sorry We Missed You, which depicts the impact of the gig economy on a struggling working-class family. Barbu hasn\u2019t witnessed anything quite that extreme but he knows of drivers who work well over the six-day limit. \u201cThey say it is illegal to work seven days but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t put you under a different name and send you out.

This year, the elegantly clad form of Stephen Bayley, formerly of this newspaper, the man for whom the phrase \u201cdesign guru\u201d was <a href=\"http://www.stephenbayley.com/\" title=\"\">reportedly coined</a>, has stepped on to the stage, apparently happy to take on the role. Bayley, in his capacity as chair of the <a href=\"http://www.rfact.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Fine Arts Commission Trust</a>, a body that aims to promote \u201cdesign excellence in architecture and the built environment\u201d, has written to the <em>Times</em>. The object of his dislike is the Christmas market in Trafalgar Square, which he calls a \u201churdy-gurdy of kitsch\u201d and \u201can assembly of tat\u201d.</p> <p>He objects to the way its huddle of huts stands in front of the \u201cnoble view\u201d from the square to the National Gallery. Concerned citizens of (for example) Edinburgh and York have voiced similar concerns about such installations in the historic centres of their cities. Vox pops on Bayley\u2019s remarks mostly didn\u2019t share his view.

Some are promoted by the developers who control what are known as privately owned public spaces, or Pops. Others are mounted by private companies with the approval of local authorities in charge of long-established squares and parks.</p> <p>Trafalgar Square, whose role in the national consciousness seems to be that of some respected but not especially liked elderly relative, highlights the issues involved. It has a certain dignity and its statues of generals and kings claim it as a place of a particular version of national identity. But no one knows quite what to do with it. Once, before the then mayor of London Ken Livingstone banned the latter activity, it was a place mostly of political demonstrations and pigeon-feeding. Also of aimless daytime lassitude and, thanks to being a terminus for night buses, raucous small hours.</p> <p>In the nearly two decades since its north side was closed to traffic, in a scheme designed by Norman Foster and his team, London mayors have been keen to liven it up, using it as a stage for the multicultural city to display itself. Celebrations are held there for Diwali, for the Sikh festival of Vaisakhi, for St George\u2019s Day. <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/our-building-and-squares/trafalgar-square\" title=\"\">Applications are welcomed</a> by the mayor\u2019s office from anyone with a plausible idea for using the square.</p> <p>Most of this, in Trafalgar Square and elsewhere, is welcome. That people in this country are better able to enjoy their urban spaces is progress. The long-envied pavement cafes and lively piazzas of the continent have at last appeared here, in a fashion, if often in a ramshackle way. Not everything is or can be to everyone\u2019s taste \u2013 I\u2019m not personally in the market for a desultorily carved wooden owl, available at the Christmas market for \u00a313.50 \u2013 but no single aspect of a city can satisfy all people all the time.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s possible to see, when surveying the current state of Trafalgar Square, what Bayley is complaining about. It is not the presence of the market, precisely, that\u2019s the problem, so much as the cluelessness with which it and other temporary elements are jammed in among the stonework. These include a crib housed in something like a bus shelter and a makeshift health-and-safety skirt of crush barriers and green tarpaulin around the 25-metre Christmas tree, donated every year by Norway in thanks for British help during the Second World War. If the Norwegians are kind enough to give us a tree \u2013 and notwithstanding some <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/trafalgar-square-christmas-tree-gift-norway-ww2-a4306406.html\" title=\"\">gripes that this year\u2019s version is a bit scraggy</a> \u2013 we should at least put a tiny bit of thought into whatever goes around its base.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80d5488ac734c3bfda71d263e61f335607be4268\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80d5488ac734c3bfda71d263e61f335607be4268/0_196_5135_3081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Christmas tree in Trafalgar Square\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Christmas tree in Trafalgar Square, behind Nelson\u2019s Column.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A Christmas market should be something special, selling lovingly made products you can\u2019t get elsewhere. A Christmas market in Trafalgar Square should be exceptional, the best of its kind. Instead, we get two rows of predictable and generic chalets, too many of them selling the touristic junk that is available 365 days of the year. There is a hollowness to the jollity that comes from the sense that the primary aim is profit for the operators, not fulfilment for the buyers or vendors. Inevitable outlets for bratwurst and gl\u00fchwein gesture towards the concept\u2019s German and Austrian origins. A visitor from Berlin, interviewed by the <em>Times</em>, was underwhelmed.</p> <p>Sarah Gaventa, a champion of public space now working on the project to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/17/london-bridges-go-led-as-part-of-45m-longest-artwork-project-lighting-thames\" title=\"\">illuminate the Thames bridges</a>, says it is about \u201cgathering, sometimes protesting, not shops, about things you can do together and for free\u201d. One good test of a temporary use is therefore whether it can enjoyed without spending any money. Another is whether it dominates its setting to the exclusion of whatever else might be pleasurable about a place.</p> <p>As Gaventa also says, any intervention should \u201crespect\u201d where it is. In a park, this should exclude events that devastate the greenery. In Trafalgar Square, it should include the recognition that this is a special location, not another piece of land to be exploited. There are two other Christmas markets a short walk away, in Leicester Square and on the South Bank. Does anyone really, truly need another?</p> <p>At the very least, there needs to be more intelligence and design in the way that temporary elements go together and a more ambitious bar set for those who seek the privilege of holding events in famous places, but there is a bigger issue here than aesthetics. It is about the ownership of public space and the extent to which it may be colonised by business. The sane answer lies somewhere between zero and 100%. It would make no sense to ban all selling of anything in public squares, but neither do you want them to be year-round outdoor supermarkets and entertainment venues.</p> <p>Christmas markets may only come once a year, but they need to earn their right to occupy the hearts of great cities.</p> <p>\u2022 Rowan Moore is the Observer\u2019s architecture correspondent</p>",

They were along the lines of \u201cI think it just adds a bit of Christmas spirit\u201d or: \u201cIt\u2019s only going to stay here for like one month, so it doesn\u2019t really matter in my opinion.\u201d Christmas markets, along with big screens for World Cups and Wimbledon, temporary stages, ice rinks, film screenings and cultural and commercial pop-ups, are part of a wave of structured and sponsored events in the open spaces of British cities that have been growing in popularity for most of this century. Some are promoted by the developers who control what are known as privately owned public spaces, or Pops. Others are mounted by private companies with the approval of local authorities in charge of long-established squares and parks. Trafalgar Square, whose role in the national consciousness seems to be that of some respected but not especially liked elderly relative, highlights the issues involved. It has a certain dignity and its statues of generals and kings claim it as a place of a particular version of national identity. But no one knows quite what to do with it. Once, before the then mayor of London Ken Livingstone banned the latter activity, it was a place mostly of political demonstrations and pigeon-feeding. Also of aimless daytime lassitude and, thanks to being a terminus for night buses, raucous small hours. In the nearly two decades since its north side was closed to traffic, in a scheme designed by Norman Foster and his team, London mayors have been keen to liven it up, using it as a stage for the multicultural city to display itself. Celebrations are held there for Diwali, for the Sikh festival of Vaisakhi, for St George\u2019s Day. Applications are welcomed by the mayor\u2019s office from anyone with a plausible idea for using the square. Most of this, in Trafalgar Square and elsewhere, is welcome. That people in this country are better able to enjoy their urban spaces is progress. The long-envied pavement cafes and lively piazzas of the continent have at last appeared here, in a fashion, if often in a ramshackle way. Not everything is or can be to everyone\u2019s taste \u2013 I\u2019m not personally in the market for a desultorily carved wooden owl, available at the Christmas market for \u00a313.50 \u2013 but no single aspect of a city can satisfy all people all the time. Still, it\u2019s possible to see, when surveying the current state of Trafalgar Square, what Bayley is complaining about. It is not the presence of the market, precisely, that\u2019s the problem, so much as the cluelessness with which it and other temporary elements are jammed in among the stonework. These include a crib housed in something like a bus shelter and a makeshift health-and-safety skirt of crush barriers and green tarpaulin around the 25-metre Christmas tree, donated every year by Norway in thanks for British help during the Second World War. If the Norwegians are kind enough to give us a tree \u2013 and notwithstanding some gripes that this year\u2019s version is a bit scraggy \u2013 we should at least put a tiny bit of thought into whatever goes around its base. A Christmas market should be something special, selling lovingly made products you can\u2019t get elsewhere. A Christmas market in Trafalgar Square should be exceptional, the best of its kind. Instead, we get two rows of predictable and generic chalets, too many of them selling the touristic junk that is available 365 days of the year. There is a hollowness to the jollity that comes from the sense that the primary aim is profit for the operators, not fulfilment for the buyers or vendors. Inevitable outlets for bratwurst and gl\u00fchwein gesture towards the concept\u2019s German and Austrian origins. A visitor from Berlin, interviewed by the Times, was underwhelmed. Sarah Gaventa, a champion of public space now working on the project to illuminate the Thames bridges, says it is about \u201cgathering, sometimes protesting, not shops, about things you can do together and for free\u201d. One good test of a temporary use is therefore whether it can enjoyed without spending any money. Another is whether it dominates its setting to the exclusion of whatever else might be pleasurable about a place. As Gaventa also says, any intervention should \u201crespect\u201d where it is. In a park, this should exclude events that devastate the greenery. In Trafalgar Square, it should include the recognition that this is a special location, not another piece of land to be exploited. There are two other Christmas markets a short walk away, in Leicester Square and on the South Bank. Does anyone really, truly need another? At the very least, there needs to be more intelligence and design in the way that temporary elements go together and a more ambitious bar set for those who seek the privilege of holding events in famous places, but there is a bigger issue here than aesthetics. It is about the ownership of public space and the extent to which it may be colonised by business. The sane answer lies somewhere between zero and 100%. It would make no sense to ban all selling of anything in public squares, but neither do you want them to be year-round outdoor supermarkets and entertainment venues. Christmas markets may only come once a year, but they need to earn their right to occupy the hearts of great cities. \u2022 Rowan Moore is the Observer\u2019s architecture correspondent",

Stocks of fish on which local villages depend could become depleted and fishermen have to turn to something else. Sometimes the only thing on offer is a creature that is legally protected.\u201d</p> <p>This point was backed by Fran Cabada, a marine biologist at ZSL. \u201cFisherfolk across the world have a very close relationship with the sea,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you try to find them a different job, say in a factory, they will not want to take it. They prefer jobs that allow them to be at sea, even if the work there is illegal. So again, we have to include social and economic factors when understanding and tackling illegal wildlife trade, both at sea and on land.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, the illegal wildlife trade is often linked with organised crime so it may simply be that local people feel compelled to join in, added Cabada.</p> <p>Miller, who now works for ZSL, agreed. \u201cThe organised criminal is always looking for the next opportunity to hammer a particular species. We will see that in the next few months in the UK with the beginning of the fishing season for the European eel. Organised criminals will try to source elvers and ship them out of Europe to markets where they can be made into finished products and then sold round the world \u2013 not as endangered European eels but as Japanese eel or American eel. However, gene-testing techniques have recently been developed that allow us to tell very quickly if eel is arriving in a port but is not what it is claimed to be. It is all part of an ongoing battle.\u201d</p>",

One idea is to use technological fixes \u2013 such as drones which could be flown over ships to film crewmen in the act of dismembering sharks, said Letessier. \u201cThe development of increasingly accurate devices, such as synthetic aperture radar for satellites, would also allow authorities to monitor illegal fishing from space in real time,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, it is equally clear that we have to consider social factors when working out why people turn to illegal wildlife trade. Stocks of fish on which local villages depend could become depleted and fishermen have to turn to something else. Sometimes the only thing on offer is a creature that is legally protected.\u201d This point was backed by Fran Cabada, a marine biologist at ZSL. \u201cFisherfolk across the world have a very close relationship with the sea,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you try to find them a different job, say in a factory, they will not want to take it. They prefer jobs that allow them to be at sea, even if the work there is illegal. So again, we have to include social and economic factors when understanding and tackling illegal wildlife trade, both at sea and on land.\u201d In addition, the illegal wildlife trade is often linked with organised crime so it may simply be that local people feel compelled to join in, added Cabada. Miller, who now works for ZSL, agreed. \u201cThe organised criminal is always looking for the next opportunity to hammer a particular species. We will see that in the next few months in the UK with the beginning of the fishing season for the European eel. Organised criminals will try to source elvers and ship them out of Europe to markets where they can be made into finished products and then sold round the world \u2013 not as endangered European eels but as Japanese eel or American eel. However, gene-testing techniques have recently been developed that allow us to tell very quickly if eel is arriving in a port but is not what it is claimed to be. It is all part of an ongoing battle.\u201d",

Two days after being seriously injured in the collapse, he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and subsequently deported to Honduras, against the protests of immigration advocates and the head of a state labor agency.

A <a href=\"https://www.law.berkeley.edu/press-release/tulane-uc-berkeley-study-shows-katrina-rebuilding-leads-to-violations-of-workers-rights/\">2006 academic study</a> found about half of the reconstruction workforce was Latinx, and about half of that group was undocumented. The majority of Latinx workers relocated to New Orleans from other areas of the United States.</p> <p>\u201cSo many of the people that were gutting the moldy buildings, and tearing walls down and doing the dirty work that has to be done in mold-infested houses were Latino workers,\u201d said Longoria. \u201c[They] without a doubt, reconstructed and rebuilt New Orleans.\u201d</p> <p>In an effort to speed up construction after the storm, the federal government suspended enforcement of employee eligibility checks by employers and certain workplace protection measures.</p> <p>The result was widespread worker exploitation.</p> <p>\u201cThere was wage theft, there was underpayment of wages, there was abuse of the employees,\u201d said Longoria.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hurricane-katrina-anniversary/latino-workers-helped-rebuild-new-orleans-many-werent-paid-n417571\">Reports</a> from 2015 found day laborers were still waiting to get paid for post-Katrina work a decade after the storm.</p> <p>Many leading advocacy groups in the city \u2013 like the Congress of Day Laborers, an immigrant-led activism group affiliated with the New Orleans Center for Racial Justice \u2013 were created as a response to the rampant abuse of Latinx workers in the wake of the storm.</p> <p>Post-Katrina, the Latinx community developed a strong and growing presence in New Orleans.

      "bodyText": "The sight of the collapsed Hard Rock Hotel is impossible to escape on the busy Canal Street corridor downtown. Slabs of broken gray concrete form a frozen landslide 18 stories above the ground, and the arm of a massive crane stands almost upright after a botched removal effort left it embedded in the sidewalk below. Nearly three months after the deadly collapse, the bodies of two victims \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Ponce Arreola, from Mexico, and Quinnyon Wimberly, from New Orleans \u2013 still remain inside the wreckage. After Delmer Joel Ram\u00edrez Palma was deported just days after Thanksgiving, the Hard Rock ruins serve as a stunning visual reminder of the precarious situation of undocumented workers who hold a unique place in the history of post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans. Having helped rebuild New Orleans and much of the surrounding region after the hurricane, they now face being hounded out of the place many of them call home. Ram\u00edrez Palma, an undocumented construction worker at the Hard Rock, had tried to warn supervisors of construction safety concerns but was ordered to ignore the issues, according to his lawyers and family. Two days after being seriously injured in the collapse, he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and subsequently deported to Honduras, against the protests of immigration advocates and the head of a state labor agency. He had lived in New Orleans for 18 years. For many New Orleanians, the treatment of Ram\u00edrez Palma was both a stinging rebuff to the contributions of undocumented immigrants in New Orleans over the years, and yet another example in a long history of Latinx worker abuse in the city. \u201cIt\u2019s just unconscionable. It\u2019s unreal how evil sometimes their policies are,\u201d Salvador Longoria, executive director of Puentes New Orleans, said of Ice\u2019s decision to deport the Honduran father of three. Longoria co-founded Puentes, a local Latinx advocacy not-for-profit, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to help support and assimilate the thousands of workers who came to New Orleans to rebuild the city after it was flooded by a massive levee failure. In the New Orleans area, undocumented families have had to change the way they live in Ice\u2019s shadow, Longoria said. He knows of families that limit their outings to work and the grocery store, and of children who have memorized a plan of action, including who to call to post bail, in case their parents do not return home after work. \u201cThey\u2019re dealing with real dystopian scenarios,\u201d said Longoria. \u201cAfter the raids and after the detention of so many other people, that\u2019s what they\u2019re living with every day and it really is a constant fear and tension about what could happen,\u201d he said. Within the last six months his organization received an uptick in requests for \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d training from undocumented communities in neighborhoods across New Orleans to help protect themselves in case of an encounter with Ice. Latinx workers, many undocumented, were a pivotal force in the city\u2019s post-Katrina recovery. A 2006 academic study found about half of the reconstruction workforce was Latinx, and about half of that group was undocumented. The majority of Latinx workers relocated to New Orleans from other areas of the United States. \u201cSo many of the people that were gutting the moldy buildings, and tearing walls down and doing the dirty work that has to be done in mold-infested houses were Latino workers,\u201d said Longoria. \u201c[They] without a doubt, reconstructed and rebuilt New Orleans.\u201d In an effort to speed up construction after the storm, the federal government suspended enforcement of employee eligibility checks by employers and certain workplace protection measures. The result was widespread worker exploitation. \u201cThere was wage theft, there was underpayment of wages, there was abuse of the employees,\u201d said Longoria. Reports from 2015 found day laborers were still waiting to get paid for post-Katrina work a decade after the storm. Many leading advocacy groups in the city \u2013 like the Congress of Day Laborers, an immigrant-led activism group affiliated with the New Orleans Center for Racial Justice \u2013 were created as a response to the rampant abuse of Latinx workers in the wake of the storm. Post-Katrina, the Latinx community developed a strong and growing presence in New Orleans. Since 2010, the Hispanic population has grown by 24%, outpacing 7% total growth in the metro area, according to the latest statistics from the New Orleans Data Center. Most of the area\u2019s 114,000 Latinxs reside in the suburban areas of Jefferson Parish, outside New Orleans, and Hondurans represent about a third of the Latinx population in the area. While Ice maintained a steady rate of deportations under President Obama, the current administration\u2019s increasingly aggressive crackdown on immigration and asylum seekers has cast a new level of fear among Latinxs in New Orleans, like so many other cities and towns across the US. Louisiana has also recently emerged as a new hub of migrant detention. Over the past year, Ice has expanded its network of detention centers across the state with eight new facilities, all former state prisons and local jails. As of today, 7,513 people, or 17% of the 44,538 national detainees, are being held in Ice custody in Louisiana, according to an agency official. While Louisiana\u2019s converted jails are also housing detainees from out of state, the sharp rise in detention capacity and remote locations of the new facilities has alarmed local undocumented workers and immigration advocates. Bruce Hamilton, staff attorney of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Louisiana, said he drives up to five hours to reach clients detained in Ice facilities across the state. Remote detention centers add yet another layer of difficulty to an already complicated immigration system and has a tangible impact on the outcomes of asylum cases, lawyers and advocates say. \u201c[Asylum-seekers] are very much cut off from the resources that could help you with asylum,\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cYou don\u2019t have access to your papers, if they\u2019re in the care and custody of your family. You don\u2019t have access necessarily to an attorney. And you may have very limited access to the internet or to a law library.\u201d A spate of controversial cases in Louisiana this year \u2013 including the detention and deportation of Yoel Alono Leal, a Cuban man with cancer, and the suicide of another Cuban, Roylan Hern\u00e1ndez-D\u00edaz, while in a private Ice detention facility \u2013 have prompted popular outcry against Ice policies. The ACLU is pushing Ice to stop the use of solitary confinement in detention centers and grant bonds and parole for asylum seekers on humanitarian grounds. Granting of parole requests has dropped precipitously among certain Ice field offices, from more than 90% in 2011-2013 to 4% in February-September 2017, according to an ACLU lawsuit. Ice officials did not respond to a question on parole denials but said in an email statement: \u201cBond decisions are based on an alien\u2019s flight risk, and the potential threat to public safety. Each case is reviewed individually, taking into account factors like immigration history, criminal history and community ties.\u201d While New Orleans keeps a sanctuary city policy that prevents local police from aiding Ice, in suburban municipalities \u2013 where the Latinx population is concentrated \u2013 offer no such protections for the undocumented. Still, New Orleans, which exists in the mainstream imagination along a black/white racial binary, isn\u2019t immune to anti-Latino sentiment, says Longoria. His family emigrated to New Orleans from Cuba when he was four years old, and he noted that even while most New Orleanians are accepting of the Latinx community, he still perceives a gradual shift in racial anxieties. \u201cI grew up here and I never felt a tension about my Latino identity and my assimilation in the city. But, as the years have gone on, when certain people see the number of Latinos increasing \u2026 they feel that for some reason or another their way of life is threatened.\u201d Longoria still takes the long view: \u201cI hope that most New Orleanians realize that, you know, Latinos have actually been here since the city was founded,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just a new phase of that history that has always existed in New Orleans.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><em>Frost Fair </em>is a tiny book, about 4in x 4in, and might be alighted upon as a stocking filler, though, unlike most stocking fillers, it will surely survive Christmas Day.</p> <p>It is tempting to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/08/carol-ann-duffy-wish-i-d-written-harry-potter\" title=\"\">Carol Ann Duffy</a> for granted, in rather the same way that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/09/joyce-carol-oates-interview-people-think-i-write-quickly-but-i-actually-dont\" title=\"\">Joyce Carol Oates</a> is sometimes undervalued because of her productivity. But reading this small, icy, perfectly formed book \u2013 a ballad, a winter\u2019s tale \u2013 one is reminded of Duffy\u2019s consistent excellence. And here she is supported by <a href=\"https://www.daviddelasheras.net/en/about-me\" title=\"\">David de las Heras</a>\u2019s understatedly graceful illustrations. A solitary figure in rusty red walks through a sepia world of snow, flanked by feathery poplars. The ballad begins as an ordinary yarn: \u201cSo cold it was \u2013\u201d and then after you turn the page, becomes a singular story:</p> <p>by late December, ink had frosted<br>in its well; my breath was tinkling<br>on my lips, so everything I saw to tell<br>I had to memorise. I saw birds<br>fall from trees, too stiff to fly, like stones.<br>I saw a lass, her tongue stuck to a spoon.<br>I saw an ice-hare staring lifeless at no moon.</p> <p>The image of the frozen ink beguiles. The cold means the suspending of normal services for the imagined poet. Duffy\u2019s own ability to take us into a place of the past \u2013 London in the \u201cGreat Winter\u201d of 1683 \u2013 with minimum fuss is masterly and the detail of the tongue stuck to a spoon shows we are on no ordinary path. What a pity Heras\u2019s hare does not qualify as lifeless \u2013 he looks hale, furrily kempt, ready to run.</p> <p>Duffy is a curator of cold, and her penetrating transformations continue as if in a winter exhibition: \u201cMen\u2019s tears were jewels in their beards for wives to pluck.\u201d The poem is rooted in London and involves a walk from Spitalfields in which our \u201cpoet-spy\u201d is disguised as a boy \u2013 the gentle cross-dressing further enlivening the atmosphere. The poet spies St Paul\u2019s Cathedral.</p> <p>I found this line: \u201cLondon was snow. St Paul\u2019s, a talent of the snow/ to seem more grand\u201d a bit odd \u2013 the \u201ctalent\u201d top-heavy \u2013 but I loved the roll, a line or two later, of: \u201cI saw a clock too cold to tell the time\u201d. It rings out even if the clock doesn\u2019t. And there is a shivery moment (perhaps looking centuries ahead) when she writes:</p> <p>I mused on climate \u2013 how it could clench<br>the greatest city in its bitter fist<br>and squeeze.</p> <p>Later, comes a fleeting moment of romance:</p> <p>I met a wench who thought I was a man,<br>or didn\u2019t care, and stole a salty kiss.<br>I\u2019ve never seen her since.</p> <p>In lesser hands, a ballad of this kind might fall into repro folksiness, but Duffy knows how and where to let contemporary language ventilate the verse (\u201cTrees went to pieces; cracked\u201d). The rhymes are assured \u2013 and sometimes beautiful:</p> <p>\u2026 beside a bawd whose eyes were hard as gems.<br>My mouth as wide as one at Bethlehem\u2019s.</p> <p>Bethlehem feels momentarily unlikely and then inevitable. The characters she describes share a strangeness and are never hackneyed. And she knows how to change tone at the end, without strain, to a final vision \u2013 a gift to us:</p> <p>Two swans <br>alighted, swerving on the blazing glaze,<br>then flew, creaking, away. I spoke a prayer.<br>I saw my words freeze on the air<br>and hang, preserved, to thaw now in your ear.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Frost Fair </em>by Carol Ann Duffy (illustrations by David de las Heras) is published by Picador (\u00a37.99).

      "bodyText": "Frost Fair is a tiny book, about 4in x 4in, and might be alighted upon as a stocking filler, though, unlike most stocking fillers, it will surely survive Christmas Day. It is tempting to take Carol Ann Duffy for granted, in rather the same way that Joyce Carol Oates is sometimes undervalued because of her productivity. But reading this small, icy, perfectly formed book \u2013 a ballad, a winter\u2019s tale \u2013 one is reminded of Duffy\u2019s consistent excellence. And here she is supported by David de las Heras\u2019s understatedly graceful illustrations. A solitary figure in rusty red walks through a sepia world of snow, flanked by feathery poplars. The ballad begins as an ordinary yarn: \u201cSo cold it was \u2013\u201d and then after you turn the page, becomes a singular story: by late December, ink had frosted in its well; my breath was tinkling on my lips, so everything I saw to tell I had to memorise. I saw birds fall from trees, too stiff to fly, like stones. I saw a lass, her tongue stuck to a spoon. I saw an ice-hare staring lifeless at no moon. The image of the frozen ink beguiles. The cold means the suspending of normal services for the imagined poet. Duffy\u2019s own ability to take us into a place of the past \u2013 London in the \u201cGreat Winter\u201d of 1683 \u2013 with minimum fuss is masterly and the detail of the tongue stuck to a spoon shows we are on no ordinary path. What a pity Heras\u2019s hare does not qualify as lifeless \u2013 he looks hale, furrily kempt, ready to run. Duffy is a curator of cold, and her penetrating transformations continue as if in a winter exhibition: \u201cMen\u2019s tears were jewels in their beards for wives to pluck.\u201d The poem is rooted in London and involves a walk from Spitalfields in which our \u201cpoet-spy\u201d is disguised as a boy \u2013 the gentle cross-dressing further enlivening the atmosphere. The poet spies St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. I found this line: \u201cLondon was snow. St Paul\u2019s, a talent of the snow/ to seem more grand\u201d a bit odd \u2013 the \u201ctalent\u201d top-heavy \u2013 but I loved the roll, a line or two later, of: \u201cI saw a clock too cold to tell the time\u201d. It rings out even if the clock doesn\u2019t. And there is a shivery moment (perhaps looking centuries ahead) when she writes: I mused on climate \u2013 how it could clench the greatest city in its bitter fist and squeeze. Later, comes a fleeting moment of romance: I met a wench who thought I was a man, or didn\u2019t care, and stole a salty kiss. I\u2019ve never seen her since. In lesser hands, a ballad of this kind might fall into repro folksiness, but Duffy knows how and where to let contemporary language ventilate the verse (\u201cTrees went to pieces; cracked\u201d). The rhymes are assured \u2013 and sometimes beautiful: \u2026 beside a bawd whose eyes were hard as gems. My mouth as wide as one at Bethlehem\u2019s. Bethlehem feels momentarily unlikely and then inevitable. The characters she describes share a strangeness and are never hackneyed. And she knows how to change tone at the end, without strain, to a final vision \u2013 a gift to us: Two swans alighted, swerving on the blazing glaze, then flew, creaking, away. I spoke a prayer. I saw my words freeze on the air and hang, preserved, to thaw now in your ear. \u2022 Frost Fair by Carol Ann Duffy (illustrations by David de las Heras) is published by Picador (\u00a37.99).

      "body": "<h2>Anxiety</h2> <p>Much like the planet, people have a tipping point. Mine came last summer, when a respected scientist told me matter-of-factly that he thought it was \u201cat least highly <em>unlikely</em>\u201d that his teenage children would survive beyond late middle age. At that point, three decades of climate unease crystallised into debilitating dread, and I\u2019m far from alone.</p> <p>\u201cThere are hundreds of people contacting us, looking for support,\u201d says Caroline Hickman of the <a href=\"https://www.climatepsychologyalliance.org/\" title=\"\">Climate Psychology Alliance</a>. It\u2019s not just individuals either. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a level where organisations are asking for professional help to support their staff: civil servants, museums, universities\u2026 They\u2019re noticing massive increases in anxiety and concern.\u201d</p> <p>Eco anxiety isn\u2019t pathological: it\u2019s a legitimate reaction to the climate crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s mentally healthy to feel this way,\u201d says Hickman. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of empathy.\u201d The real problem is how we manage our feelings.</p> <h2>Biodiversity</h2> <p>We know that global species extinction \u2013 already at a rate that is unprecedented<strong> </strong>over the past 10m years \u2013 is accelerating, but here\u2019s a chilling example: the UK has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/07/hedgehog-numbers-plummet-by-half-in-uk-countryside-since-2000\" title=\"\">lost 97% of its hedgehog population since the 1950s</a>.</p> <p>\u201cYou look at these horrific headlines about habitats and mass extinctions,\u201d says Emma Mitchell, author of <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wild-Remedy-Nature-Mends-Diary/dp/1789290422\" title=\"\">The Wild Remedy: How Nature Mends Us</a></em>. \u201cPeople say, \u2018What can we do, we feel completely powerless?\u2019 My answer is: we can do a great deal.\u201d</p> <p>If you have outside space, follow gardener and author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-bradbury\" title=\"\">Kate Bradbury</a>\u2019s advice and plant native. \u201cNative plants have specific relationships with native moths, which lay their eggs on the leaves,\u201d she says. \u201cBirds then feed the caterpillars to their young, and hedgehogs, frogs, mice, wasps\u2026 pretty much everything eats caterpillars. So by planting native shrubs and trees you\u2019re creating a food chain in your garden and, literally, preventing further decline of species.\u201d</p> <p>Avoid peat-based compost: peat stores vast amounts of carbon and peat bogs are precious habitats for wildlife.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t already, support local campaigns to preserve habitat. An area of exceptional biodiversity near me is currently under threat, so I\u2019m signing petitions, protesting and sneaking it into articles (save <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-46781549%0D\" title=\"\">Askham Bog</a>!) . Incidentally, as Mitchell says, \u201cThere\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6277587/\" title=\"\">research that shows</a> that if the biodiversity in a green space is higher it has more of a positive impact on your mental health.\u201d</p> <h2>Community</h2> <p>The climate crisis is happening to all of us and experts agree the most effective responses to it are collective. Acting together helps us feel less powerless, but there are also real benefits to expressing our anxiety, anger or grief with others.</p> <p>\u201cMany people report that actually finding that they are not alone in this thinking, talking to other people about it, finding like-minded communities, is really powerful,\u201d says Dr Emma Lawrance, a fellow at Imperial College London\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/global-health-innovation/\" title=\"\">Institute of Global Health Innovation</a>. In the US, the <a href=\"https://www.goodgriefnetwork.org/\" title=\"\">Good Grief Network</a> hosts climate anxiety groups based loosely on the AA model, with a 10-step programme, from \u201cAccept the severity of the predicament\u201d to \u201cReinvest in meaningful effort.\u201d</p> <h2>Denial</h2> <p>Despite overwhelming evidence, truly terrifying institutional denial of the climate crisis continues. The Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/06/08/white-house-blocked-intelligence-aides-written-testimony-saying-human-caused-climate-change-could-be-possibly-catastrophic/\" title=\"\">blocked a congressional testimony warning </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/06/08/white-house-blocked-intelligence-aides-written-testimony-saying-human-caused-climate-change-could-be-possibly-catastrophic/\" title=\"\">about climate change</a>, suppressed peer-reviewed government-funded studies on its effects, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/25/trump-administration-climate-crisis-denying-scientist\" title=\"\">fired a scientist</a> who refused to alter reports to downplay its human causes.

Just when you think you have an answer (Cotton! Clothes rental! H&amp;M!), someone pops up to tell you it\u2019s problematic,\u201d says Lauren Bravo, whose book, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Break-Fast-Fashion-guilt-free/dp/1472267745\" title=\"\">How to Break Up with Fast Fashion</a></em>, is published soon. It\u2019s a funny, achievable guide to reducing our fabric footprint, and covers swapping, mending, washing less and, most importantly, resisting the urge to shop.</p> <h2>Greta</h2> <p>Does brilliant, furious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a> make you feel uncomfortable? She should. She should be making <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/en/\" title=\"\">TikToks</a> or something, not crossing oceans to shout at the UN, or becoming a beacon of misplaced \u201chope\u201d for a generation too feeble to acknowledge its catastrophic failures. No wonder she makes a certain type of middle-aged person incandescently angry and many of the rest of us profoundly guilty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de1cbae17ccb4c72cf27f59d943d05fbc3bf65d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de1cbae17ccb4c72cf27f59d943d05fbc3bf65d7/0_143_4519_4220/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a misshaped globe with pipes and smoke coming out of it and people standing around looking up at it, helpless\" width=\"1000\" height=\"934\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Demand for electricity is falling, so there is some good news.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Phil Hackett/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Hope</h2> <p>\u201cIs there <em>any</em> good news?\u201d I text my father, sorrowfully. An ecologist who predicted a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of food, water and energy shortage within our lifetime 10 years ago, he\u2019s not inclined to boundless optimism. Nostra-dad-mus flagged the <a href=\"https://www.un-redd.org/\" title=\"\">UN-REDD</a> programme, which is making real progress in fighting deforestation worldwide.

New biodiversity! I for one welcome our new yellow overlord.</p> <h2>Information</h2> <p>The onslaught of information on extreme weather events, dire research findings and ecological catastrophes fuels our sense of panic and powerlessness, every forest fire or starving polar bear is a jolt of stress. \u201cObviously people want and need to be informed and understand the facts, and it\u2019s normal to feel strong emotions in response to those facts,\u201d says Dr Emma Lawrance of Imperial College. \u201cBut it\u2019s important when people are finding it too much that they feel like they are able to step back and take breaks.\u201d</p> <p>Decide how and when to engage with climate-crisis information and seek out good environmental news: it is out there.</p> <h2>Jet anxiety</h2> <p>Feel sick on planes and not because of turbulence? You\u2019re not alone. The Swedish concept of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/09/flight-airline-travel-rail-family-environment\" title=\"\">flygskam</a></em>, flying shame, has gone mainstream, though we\u2019ve yet to assimilate the associated <em>t\u00e5gskryt</em> (train bragging) or find an equivalent for #<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/stayontheground-swedes-turn-to-trains-amid-climate-flight-shame\" title=\"\">jagstannarp\u00e5marken</a></em>, meaning \u201cI stay on the ground.\u201d Flygskam works: the number of domestic Swedish flights dropped by 8% in the first four months of this year. I wonder if there\u2019s a Swedish term for \u201cpaying a fortune for a terrible service provided by amoral weasels\u201d? Probably not\u2026 lucky Swedes.</p> <h2>Kids</h2> <p>In her work as a research fellow at the University of Bath, Caroline Hickman frequently talks to children (and their worried parents) about climate anxiety. Her advice? Resist the natural impulse to try to protect them. \u201cChildren are online and finding out about this stuff. You need to learn how to take them towards painful things, show them how to navigate, but not to get overwhelmed and terrified.\u201d It\u2019s important to tell the truth, but balance it with positive messages and activities. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/oct/28/how-to-talk-to-kids-about-the-climate-crisis%0D\" title=\"\">Hickman</a> says, \u201cReminders to still play, even though we\u2019re dealing with painful things, are absolutely crucial.\u201d</p> <h2>Loss</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/19/iceland-holds-funeral-for-first-glacier-lost-to-climate-change\" title=\"\">funeral that Iceland held for the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/19/iceland-holds-funeral-for-first-glacier-lost-to-climate-change\" title=\"\">Okjokull</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/19/iceland-holds-funeral-for-first-glacier-lost-to-climate-change\" title=\"\"> glacier</a> this summer, after it was lost to climate change, was a pure expression of \u201csolastalgia\u201d, a term coined by philosopher Glenn Albrecht and defined as \u201cThe pain or sickness caused by the loss of, or inability to derive solace from, the present state of one\u2019s home environment.\u201d In parts of the world where the impact of climate change is physically unavoidable, loss and grief are the dominant emotions: we\u2019re lucky we\u2019re just anxious.</p> <h2>Milk</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"981f8299b4d3ac95480b73f3a06569088d0820ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/981f8299b4d3ac95480b73f3a06569088d0820ef/0_260_2480_2978/833.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a glum looking man holding an ice cream, in which the ice cream is the globe, melting\" width=\"833\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Dairy is bad, but plant milks frequently mean destructive monocultures.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Phil Hackett/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ooh, tricky. Dairy is bad, but plant milks frequently mean destructive monocultures. Even oat milk, the current great off-white saviour, comes in hard-to-recycle Tetra Paks. Maybe just moisten your muesli with your own tears?</p> <h2>No kids?</h2> <p>Some view choosing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/give-up-having-children-couples-save-planet-climate-crisis%0D\" title=\"\">not to have children</a> as a positive act to reduce environmental impact: a Swedish study in 2017 estimated that having one fewer child per family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children\" title=\"\">can save an average of 58.6 tonnes of carbon</a> every year. Others consider it unethical to bring children into a world whose future is so terrifyingly compromised.</p> <p>For many more, it\u2019s a fraught question. On its website, <a href=\"https://www.birthstrikeforfuture.com/\" title=\"\">BirthStrike</a>collects testimony from those struggling with the issue: \u201cOver the past 10 years or so, all the accumulated knowledge around climate change and global warming has made me increasingly nervous to have children,\u201d says one.</p> <p>For eco-anxious parents, it\u2019s another source of guilt and worry: have we ruined the planet by having kids, or our kids by having them at such an awful time?</p> <h2>Oceans</h2> <p>We\u2019ve mistreated the ocean for decades and now it\u2019s coming for us: recent research has indicated that 300 million people (rather than the previous estimate of 80 million) are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/rising-sea-levels-pose-threat-to-homes-of-300m-people-study\" title=\"\">at risk from rising sea levels</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/\" title=\"\">IPCC</a> has also predicted that extreme events linked to sea level <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/25/extreme-sea-level-events-will-hit-once-a-year-by-2050\" title=\"\">will be annual by 2050</a>. Then there\u2019s acidification, plastics and bleaching of corals. How anyone still finds ocean sounds relaxing is beyond me: you might as well meditate to revving chainsaws.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c3497e490923e8bfb04b085ce505083dc022f152\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3497e490923e8bfb04b085ce505083dc022f152/0_258_1890_2390/791.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of an egg timer with fish swimming around in the top half and fish skeletons in the bottom half\" width=\"791\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019ve mistreated the ocean for decades and now.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Phil Hackett/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Paralysis</h2> <p>That feeling of helplessness is a common response to catastrophic ecological news. I often stand in the supermarket overwhelmed: is all fish terrible? How about bananas? It feels as if there are no simple decisions now, but according to <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/\" title=\"\">Imperial College\u2019s Grantham Institute</a>, there are a few, actually. The Institute (which is working towards \u201ca sustainable, resilient, zero-carbon future\u201d) has published a list of <a href=\"http://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/9-things-you-can-do-about-climate-change.php\" title=\"\">9 Things You Can Do About Climate Change</a>. They are things \u201cabsolutely everybody can do that can make a difference,\u201d according to Institute co-director Martin Siegert. Some are covered here (eat less meat, preserve green spaces, avoid flying); others \u2013 invest your money wisely, use your voice \u2013 aren\u2019t. \u201cThey are relatively small steps,\u201d says Siegert. \u201cIf anything, they\u2019re going to improve your life.\u201d</p> <h2>Quinoa</h2> <p>Gluten-free, high in protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals, the nubbly South American grain soared in popularity in the health-conscious 2000s. Soon, reports emerged that its cultivation was bad for Andean farmers, then there were counter-claims that it wasn\u2019t. There now seems to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/25/quinoa-good-evil-complicated\">consensus</a> that its \u201csuper food\u201d status contributes to unsustainable farming techniques, meaning fewer llamas. </p> <p>Can we finally stop eating Satan\u2019s cereal? Llamas are great and we need some good news.</p> <h2>Resilience</h2> <p>\u201cBuilding resilience is essential to address the physical and mental health impacts of climate change,\u201d said the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/03/mental-health-climate.pdf\" title=\"\">American Psychological Association</a> in 2017.</p> <p>But how? Experts agree on broad strategies: acknowledge your feelings, take action in ways that feel meaningful, be part of a community and occasionally run around screaming until you\u2019re hoarse (OK, not the last bit).</p> <h2>Single-use plastic</h2> <p>It\u2019s terrible, but guess what? It\u2019s also complicated. An Environment Agency report concluded you\u2019d have to use your cotton tote <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47027792\" title=\"\">131 times</a> to take its global warming potential below that of a plastic bag. Or what about cucumbers? 2011 research for the<em> Journal of Food Science and </em><em>Technology</em> indicated plastic wrapping increases shelf life by six days, so what\u2019s more important: avoiding waste or eliminating plastic?</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the opacity and inconsistency of recycling policies. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-45496884\" title=\"\">Recent BBC research</a> found that 47% of people argue about what plastic can be recycled, which seems low \u2013 I know 100% of my household is sick of me uncovering their recycling transgressions and complaining about them.</p> <h2>Tories</h2> <p>The UK Committee on Climate Change\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/reducing-uk-emissions-2019-progress-report-to-parliament/\" title=\"\">2019 report on progress</a> makes for dismal reading. The Government has implemented only one of the committee\u2019s 25 recommendations from 2018 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/10/uks-preparation-for-climate-crisis-like-dads-army\" title=\"\">runs its climate crisis preparations \u201clike Dad\u2019s Army\u201d</a>, according to committee chairman Lord Deben. The \u201cnet zero\u201d law promises to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and the fracking ban looks like good news (if it doesn\u2019t turn out to be a short-lived election stunt), but the CCC\u2019s prediction is that 2025 and 2030 targets will be missed by an even bigger margin than last year\u2019s.</p> <h2>Urgency</h2> <p>Greta said it: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/25/our-house-is-on-fire-greta-thunberg16-urges-leaders-to-act-on-climate\" title=\"\">our house is on fire</a>. But, of course, right now, your actual house isn\u2019t. It\u2019s quite chilly in mine and there\u2019s a blue tit pecking a fat ball outside. That\u2019s part of the problem: we \u2013 at least in the north \u2013 can ignore the climate crisis much of the time, which makes the eco-anxious feel like those chaps who march around wearing sandwich boards saying the end is nigh.</p> <h2>Veganism</h2> <p>Ah, veganism, the most emotive of dietary regimes\u2026 yes, worse than cannibalism. A recent <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/25/why-do-people-hate-vegans\">Guardian</a></em> investigation asked: \u201cWhy do people hate vegans?\u201d From <em>Waitrose Food</em> magazine editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/31/waitrose-magazine-editor-william-sitwell-steps-down-over-email-mocking-vegans\" title=\"\">William Sitwell\u2019s notorious \u201ckilling vegans\u201d email</a>, to Piers Morgan\u2019s boggle-eyed outrage at the launch of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj2x_NE_TNQ\" title=\"\">Greggs\u2019s vegan sausage roll</a>, there\u2019s a profound discomfort around vegans (they\u2019re better than us and we don\u2019t like it, basically), which often becomes open hostility.</p> <p>Plant-based eating isn\u2019t an environmental panacea, either. As the head of the <a href=\"https://www.fcrn.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Food Climate Research Network</a>, Dr Tara Garnett, brilliantly summarised in a recent article for <em>Brain </em><em>Food</em> magazine, recent concerns about intensive monocultures and highly processed vegan foods have led some eco-thinkers to conclude that \u201cVeganism is the vacuous entitled daughter of Big Food and Agribiz\u2026 Vegans are the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Should we be eating grass-fed beef and dumping facon and not-dogs? It\u2019s complicated, and many UK farmers are thoughtful stewards of native habitats and feel unfairly demonised. But eating fewer animal products is almost certainly a good thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"618edd93f6dabbf3308674ada65c943e3f6980f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/618edd93f6dabbf3308674ada65c943e3f6980f3/0_556_3270_1962/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a plate with a burger \u2013 with a face on it, tongue sticking out as if exhausted \u2013 and broccoli on it, and a knife and fork\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Eating fewer animal products is almost certainly a good thing\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Phil Hackett/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Wipes</h2> <p>They\u2019re not strictly a climate issue, but wipes are unequivocally terrible, changing the shape of rivers and threatening marine wildlife. We use an energy-gobbling 11bn a year, but they\u2019re easy to avoid. Let\u2019s just not, eh?</p> <h2>XR</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a> has only existed since October 2018, but swiftly shook off its \u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d reputation, with a series of high-profile protests showcasing its transformation into a global campaigning force.</p> <p>October\u2019s UK fortnight of protest had moments of controversy (the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/oct/17/protesters-dragged-off-dlr-train-as-extinction-rebellion-delay-commuters-in-london-video\" title=\"\">Canning Town tube protest</a> was widely considered a misstep), but it also showed that XR now attracts mass support, including from unexpected places: 77-year-old Rabbi Jeffrey Newman and 91-year-old John Lymes were arrested, and there are XR doctors, lawyers and farmers. </p> <p>Of course, that makes climate worriers who haven\u2019t become climate warriors feel even more guilty: why aren\u2019t we getting involved? Is it hypocritical to complain about government inaction from the comfort of our own homes? Almost certainly.</p> <h2>Youth</h2> <p>My teenage years were spent sulking to a Smiths sountrack and buying ra-ra skirts in Miss Selfridge (we didn\u2019t know about fast fashion then). Teenagers now don\u2019t have the luxury of solipsism: they\u2019re facing a world in crisis. A UK survey found 40% of 16-24-year-olds feel <a href=\"https://www.triodos.co.uk/articles/2019/how-is-the-environmental-crisis-making-us-feel\" title=\"\">\u201coverwhelmed\u201d by climate change</a>.</p> <p>For Jake Woodier of the <a href=\"https://ukscn.org/\" title=\"\">UK Student Climate Network</a>, the energy young people pour into activism is a product of the fear and anxiety they live with, from both the increasingly dire warnings in the media and from witnessing, \u201cThe destructive effects and consequences of climate breakdown suffered by their peers around the world.\u201d Taking action is an important outlet. \u201cI think that a lot of young people feel that they\u2019re suffering it alone,\u201d says Woodier. \u201cOrganising with a group and a movement gives quite a comforting sense, in a way.\u201d</p> <p>For the rest of us, it\u2019s a case of trying to understand what young people are going through and supporting them: and that means no muttering about not turning the lights out. We left the planetary lights on for decades; we\u2019re in no position to lecture them.</p> <h2>Zero waste</h2> <p>Zero waste is a seductive idea, but unsustainable unless you\u2019re an off-grid gardener-slash-engineer happy brushing your teeth with a twig. Limiting your food waste, however, is eminently achievable. Food and science writer Ann Storr turned her decades-long eco anxiety into an excellent, practical food waste blog, <a href=\"https://storrcupboard.com/\" title=\"\">the Storr Cupboard</a>.</p> <p>\u201cHalf of all the UK\u2019s food waste happens in the home,\u201d says Storr. (That\u2019s 7.1m tonnes a year, according to waste campaigners <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/food-waste-data\" title=\"\">W</a><a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/food-waste-data\" title=\"\">rap</a>.) \u201cMeal planning is the best way to reduce your waste: 10 minutes spent meal planning so that you know what to buy and when to eat it will save you money and reduce your food waste.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a small gesture; they all are. And that\u2019s OK, I think: for most of us, small change is all we have. \u201cThese most dire future scenarios are not set in stone,\u201d Emma Lawrance reminds me. \u201cThat means that even as the climate changes, at every step we can be looking at what world we want to create from that point. There\u2019s never a moment it\u2019s OK to give up; there are always steps to take towards the better trajectory.\u201d</p> <p>We can\u2019t save the world as individuals, but we can make it a tiny bit better; and perhaps save our sanity in the process.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Anxiety Much like the planet, people have a tipping point. Mine came last summer, when a respected scientist told me matter-of-factly that he thought it was \u201cat least highly unlikely\u201d that his teenage children would survive beyond late middle age. At that point, three decades of climate unease crystallised into debilitating dread, and I\u2019m far from alone. \u201cThere are hundreds of people contacting us, looking for support,\u201d says Caroline Hickman of the Climate Psychology Alliance. It\u2019s not just individuals either. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a level where organisations are asking for professional help to support their staff: civil servants, museums, universities\u2026 They\u2019re noticing massive increases in anxiety and concern.\u201d Eco anxiety isn\u2019t pathological: it\u2019s a legitimate reaction to the climate crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s mentally healthy to feel this way,\u201d says Hickman. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of empathy.\u201d The real problem is how we manage our feelings. Biodiversity We know that global species extinction \u2013 already at a rate that is unprecedented over the past 10m years \u2013 is accelerating, but here\u2019s a chilling example: the UK has lost 97% of its hedgehog population since the 1950s. \u201cYou look at these horrific headlines about habitats and mass extinctions,\u201d says Emma Mitchell, author of The Wild Remedy: How Nature Mends Us. \u201cPeople say, \u2018What can we do, we feel completely powerless?\u2019 My answer is: we can do a great deal.\u201d If you have outside space, follow gardener and author Kate Bradbury\u2019s advice and plant native. \u201cNative plants have specific relationships with native moths, which lay their eggs on the leaves,\u201d she says. \u201cBirds then feed the caterpillars to their young, and hedgehogs, frogs, mice, wasps\u2026 pretty much everything eats caterpillars. So by planting native shrubs and trees you\u2019re creating a food chain in your garden and, literally, preventing further decline of species.\u201d Avoid peat-based compost: peat stores vast amounts of carbon and peat bogs are precious habitats for wildlife. If you don\u2019t already, support local campaigns to preserve habitat. An area of exceptional biodiversity near me is currently under threat, so I\u2019m signing petitions, protesting and sneaking it into articles (save Askham Bog!) . Incidentally, as Mitchell says, \u201cThere\u2019s research that shows that if the biodiversity in a green space is higher it has more of a positive impact on your mental health.\u201d Community The climate crisis is happening to all of us and experts agree the most effective responses to it are collective. Acting together helps us feel less powerless, but there are also real benefits to expressing our anxiety, anger or grief with others. \u201cMany people report that actually finding that they are not alone in this thinking, talking to other people about it, finding like-minded communities, is really powerful,\u201d says Dr Emma Lawrance, a fellow at Imperial College London\u2019s Institute of Global Health Innovation. In the US, the Good Grief Network hosts climate anxiety groups based loosely on the AA model, with a 10-step programme, from \u201cAccept the severity of the predicament\u201d to \u201cReinvest in meaningful effort.\u201d Denial Despite overwhelming evidence, truly terrifying institutional denial of the climate crisis continues. The Trump administration has blocked a congressional testimony warning about climate change, suppressed peer-reviewed government-funded studies on its effects, and fired a scientist who refused to alter reports to downplay its human causes. Worse, the administration likes to have its climate cake and eat it, denying the science while simultaneously pointing to the advanced state of ecological devastation as justification for not blocking fossil-fuel projects, whose incremental impact, they argue, would be negligible. Meanwhile, President \u201cCome back global warming, we need you\u201d Trump has confirmed the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement if he\u2019s re-elected. Energy For the UK, at least, you can downgrade your anxiety on this score: things are improving. This year we went two weeks without using coal to generate electricity, and in the last quarter, for the first time, renewables generated more energy than fossil fuels. Increased efficiency and an evolving economy mean demand for electricity is falling, too, so there is some good news. Fast fashion We need clothes, but the fashion industry is regularly rated as one of the world\u2019s worst polluters, with textiles producing an estimated 1.2bn tonnes of greenhouse gases per year. \u201cSolving the problems of fast fashion can often feel like that puzzle where you\u2019re trying to get a fox, a chicken and a bag of grain across the river. Just when you think you have an answer (Cotton! Clothes rental! H&amp;M!), someone pops up to tell you it\u2019s problematic,\u201d says Lauren Bravo, whose book, How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, is published soon. It\u2019s a funny, achievable guide to reducing our fabric footprint, and covers swapping, mending, washing less and, most importantly, resisting the urge to shop. Greta Does brilliant, furious Greta Thunberg make you feel uncomfortable? She should. She should be making TikToks or something, not crossing oceans to shout at the UN, or becoming a beacon of misplaced \u201chope\u201d for a generation too feeble to acknowledge its catastrophic failures. No wonder she makes a certain type of middle-aged person incandescently angry and many of the rest of us profoundly guilty. Hope \u201cIs there any good news?\u201d I text my father, sorrowfully. An ecologist who predicted a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of food, water and energy shortage within our lifetime 10 years ago, he\u2019s not inclined to boundless optimism. Nostra-dad-mus flagged the UN-REDD programme, which is making real progress in fighting deforestation worldwide. Ethiopia, too, planted 350m trees in one day in July this year. And a new ocean clean-up device has shown promise in collecting plastic in the Pacific. If that\u2019s not cheering enough, how about \u201cle blob\u201d, the self-healing, problem-solving, 720-sexed organism no one understands? New biodiversity! I for one welcome our new yellow overlord. Information The onslaught of information on extreme weather events, dire research findings and ecological catastrophes fuels our sense of panic and powerlessness, every forest fire or starving polar bear is a jolt of stress. \u201cObviously people want and need to be informed and understand the facts, and it\u2019s normal to feel strong emotions in response to those facts,\u201d says Dr Emma Lawrance of Imperial College. \u201cBut it\u2019s important when people are finding it too much that they feel like they are able to step back and take breaks.\u201d Decide how and when to engage with climate-crisis information and seek out good environmental news: it is out there. Jet anxiety Feel sick on planes and not because of turbulence? You\u2019re not alone. The Swedish concept of flygskam, flying shame, has gone mainstream, though we\u2019ve yet to assimilate the associated t\u00e5gskryt (train bragging) or find an equivalent for #jagstannarp\u00e5marken, meaning \u201cI stay on the ground.\u201d Flygskam works: the number of domestic Swedish flights dropped by 8% in the first four months of this year. I wonder if there\u2019s a Swedish term for \u201cpaying a fortune for a terrible service provided by amoral weasels\u201d? Probably not\u2026 lucky Swedes. Kids In her work as a research fellow at the University of Bath, Caroline Hickman frequently talks to children (and their worried parents) about climate anxiety. Her advice? Resist the natural impulse to try to protect them. \u201cChildren are online and finding out about this stuff. You need to learn how to take them towards painful things, show them how to navigate, but not to get overwhelmed and terrified.\u201d It\u2019s important to tell the truth, but balance it with positive messages and activities. As Hickman says, \u201cReminders to still play, even though we\u2019re dealing with painful things, are absolutely crucial.\u201d Loss The funeral that Iceland held for the Okjokull glacier this summer, after it was lost to climate change, was a pure expression of \u201csolastalgia\u201d, a term coined by philosopher Glenn Albrecht and defined as \u201cThe pain or sickness caused by the loss of, or inability to derive solace from, the present state of one\u2019s home environment.\u201d In parts of the world where the impact of climate change is physically unavoidable, loss and grief are the dominant emotions: we\u2019re lucky we\u2019re just anxious. Milk Ooh, tricky. Dairy is bad, but plant milks frequently mean destructive monocultures. Even oat milk, the current great off-white saviour, comes in hard-to-recycle Tetra Paks. Maybe just moisten your muesli with your own tears? No kids? Some view choosing not to have children as a positive act to reduce environmental impact: a Swedish study in 2017 estimated that having one fewer child per family can save an average of 58.6 tonnes of carbon every year. Others consider it unethical to bring children into a world whose future is so terrifyingly compromised. For many more, it\u2019s a fraught question. On its website, BirthStrikecollects testimony from those struggling with the issue: \u201cOver the past 10 years or so, all the accumulated knowledge around climate change and global warming has made me increasingly nervous to have children,\u201d says one. For eco-anxious parents, it\u2019s another source of guilt and worry: have we ruined the planet by having kids, or our kids by having them at such an awful time? Oceans We\u2019ve mistreated the ocean for decades and now it\u2019s coming for us: recent research has indicated that 300 million people (rather than the previous estimate of 80 million) are at risk from rising sea levels. The IPCC has also predicted that extreme events linked to sea level will be annual by 2050. Then there\u2019s acidification, plastics and bleaching of corals. How anyone still finds ocean sounds relaxing is beyond me: you might as well meditate to revving chainsaws. Paralysis That feeling of helplessness is a common response to catastrophic ecological news. I often stand in the supermarket overwhelmed: is all fish terrible? How about bananas? It feels as if there are no simple decisions now, but according to Imperial College\u2019s Grantham Institute, there are a few, actually. The Institute (which is working towards \u201ca sustainable, resilient, zero-carbon future\u201d) has published a list of 9 Things You Can Do About Climate Change. They are things \u201cabsolutely everybody can do that can make a difference,\u201d according to Institute co-director Martin Siegert. Some are covered here (eat less meat, preserve green spaces, avoid flying); others \u2013 invest your money wisely, use your voice \u2013 aren\u2019t. \u201cThey are relatively small steps,\u201d says Siegert. \u201cIf anything, they\u2019re going to improve your life.\u201d Quinoa Gluten-free, high in protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals, the nubbly South American grain soared in popularity in the health-conscious 2000s. Soon, reports emerged that its cultivation was bad for Andean farmers, then there were counter-claims that it wasn\u2019t. There now seems to be a consensus that its \u201csuper food\u201d status contributes to unsustainable farming techniques, meaning fewer llamas. Can we finally stop eating Satan\u2019s cereal? Llamas are great and we need some good news. Resilience \u201cBuilding resilience is essential to address the physical and mental health impacts of climate change,\u201d said the American Psychological Association in 2017. But how? Experts agree on broad strategies: acknowledge your feelings, take action in ways that feel meaningful, be part of a community and occasionally run around screaming until you\u2019re hoarse (OK, not the last bit). Single-use plastic It\u2019s terrible, but guess what? It\u2019s also complicated. An Environment Agency report concluded you\u2019d have to use your cotton tote 131 times to take its global warming potential below that of a plastic bag. Or what about cucumbers? 2011 research for the Journal of Food Science and Technology indicated plastic wrapping increases shelf life by six days, so what\u2019s more important: avoiding waste or eliminating plastic? Then there\u2019s the opacity and inconsistency of recycling policies. Recent BBC research found that 47% of people argue about what plastic can be recycled, which seems low \u2013 I know 100% of my household is sick of me uncovering their recycling transgressions and complaining about them. Tories The UK Committee on Climate Change\u2019s 2019 report on progress makes for dismal reading. The Government has implemented only one of the committee\u2019s 25 recommendations from 2018 and runs its climate crisis preparations \u201clike Dad\u2019s Army\u201d, according to committee chairman Lord Deben. The \u201cnet zero\u201d law promises to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and the fracking ban looks like good news (if it doesn\u2019t turn out to be a short-lived election stunt), but the CCC\u2019s prediction is that 2025 and 2030 targets will be missed by an even bigger margin than last year\u2019s. Urgency Greta said it: our house is on fire. But, of course, right now, your actual house isn\u2019t. It\u2019s quite chilly in mine and there\u2019s a blue tit pecking a fat ball outside. That\u2019s part of the problem: we \u2013 at least in the north \u2013 can ignore the climate crisis much of the time, which makes the eco-anxious feel like those chaps who march around wearing sandwich boards saying the end is nigh. Veganism Ah, veganism, the most emotive of dietary regimes\u2026 yes, worse than cannibalism. A recent Guardian investigation asked: \u201cWhy do people hate vegans?\u201d From Waitrose Food magazine editor William Sitwell\u2019s notorious \u201ckilling vegans\u201d email, to Piers Morgan\u2019s boggle-eyed outrage at the launch of Greggs\u2019s vegan sausage roll, there\u2019s a profound discomfort around vegans (they\u2019re better than us and we don\u2019t like it, basically), which often becomes open hostility. Plant-based eating isn\u2019t an environmental panacea, either. As the head of the Food Climate Research Network, Dr Tara Garnett, brilliantly summarised in a recent article for Brain Food magazine, recent concerns about intensive monocultures and highly processed vegan foods have led some eco-thinkers to conclude that \u201cVeganism is the vacuous entitled daughter of Big Food and Agribiz\u2026 Vegans are the problem.\u201d Should we be eating grass-fed beef and dumping facon and not-dogs? It\u2019s complicated, and many UK farmers are thoughtful stewards of native habitats and feel unfairly demonised. But eating fewer animal products is almost certainly a good thing. Wipes They\u2019re not strictly a climate issue, but wipes are unequivocally terrible, changing the shape of rivers and threatening marine wildlife. We use an energy-gobbling 11bn a year, but they\u2019re easy to avoid. Let\u2019s just not, eh? XR Extinction Rebellion has only existed since October 2018, but swiftly shook off its \u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d reputation, with a series of high-profile protests showcasing its transformation into a global campaigning force. October\u2019s UK fortnight of protest had moments of controversy (the Canning Town tube protest was widely considered a misstep), but it also showed that XR now attracts mass support, including from unexpected places: 77-year-old Rabbi Jeffrey Newman and 91-year-old John Lymes were arrested, and there are XR doctors, lawyers and farmers. Of course, that makes climate worriers who haven\u2019t become climate warriors feel even more guilty: why aren\u2019t we getting involved? Is it hypocritical to complain about government inaction from the comfort of our own homes? Almost certainly. Youth My teenage years were spent sulking to a Smiths sountrack and buying ra-ra skirts in Miss Selfridge (we didn\u2019t know about fast fashion then). Teenagers now don\u2019t have the luxury of solipsism: they\u2019re facing a world in crisis. A UK survey found 40% of 16-24-year-olds feel \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by climate change. For Jake Woodier of the UK Student Climate Network, the energy young people pour into activism is a product of the fear and anxiety they live with, from both the increasingly dire warnings in the media and from witnessing, \u201cThe destructive effects and consequences of climate breakdown suffered by their peers around the world.\u201d Taking action is an important outlet. \u201cI think that a lot of young people feel that they\u2019re suffering it alone,\u201d says Woodier. \u201cOrganising with a group and a movement gives quite a comforting sense, in a way.\u201d For the rest of us, it\u2019s a case of trying to understand what young people are going through and supporting them: and that means no muttering about not turning the lights out. We left the planetary lights on for decades; we\u2019re in no position to lecture them. Zero waste Zero waste is a seductive idea, but unsustainable unless you\u2019re an off-grid gardener-slash-engineer happy brushing your teeth with a twig. Limiting your food waste, however, is eminently achievable. Food and science writer Ann Storr turned her decades-long eco anxiety into an excellent, practical food waste blog, the Storr Cupboard. \u201cHalf of all the UK\u2019s food waste happens in the home,\u201d says Storr. (That\u2019s 7.1m tonnes a year, according to waste campaigners Wrap.) \u201cMeal planning is the best way to reduce your waste: 10 minutes spent meal planning so that you know what to buy and when to eat it will save you money and reduce your food waste.\u201d It\u2019s a small gesture; they all are. And that\u2019s OK, I think: for most of us, small change is all we have. \u201cThese most dire future scenarios are not set in stone,\u201d Emma Lawrance reminds me. \u201cThat means that even as the climate changes, at every step we can be looking at what world we want to create from that point. There\u2019s never a moment it\u2019s OK to give up; there are always steps to take towards the better trajectory.\u201d We can\u2019t save the world as individuals, but we can make it a tiny bit better; and perhaps save our sanity in the process.",

      "body": "<p>Today, on the 70th anniversary of its founding, the UN Relief and Works Agency, the UN\u2019s main refugee agency serving Palestinians, is facing unprecedented challenges.</p> <p>It has become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/21/trump-cuts-un-agency-for-palestinian-refugees-millions-in-jeopardy-generation-radicalised\">key battleground</a> in Donald Trump\u2019s war against multilateralism and his unilateral attempts to redefine the Middle East peace process along a track proposed by Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the UNRWA has become embroiled in its own damaging scandals.</p> <p>The agency was born on the ashes of the 1948 Middle East war that saw the state of Israel established and Palestinian society dismantled with 750,000 people displaced and more than 500 Palestinian villages destroyed.</p> <p>Today, the UN general assembly mandates the UNRWA to deliver services to more than 5 million Palestinian refugees \u2013 the world\u2019s largest and arguably most vulnerable refugee population \u2013 until that historic injustice is redressed.</p> <p>While it has long been in the sights of Israel, with Netanyahu calling for the UNRWA to be \u201cdismantled\u201d as early as 2016, the Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/21/trump-cuts-un-agency-for-palestinian-refugees-millions-in-jeopardy-generation-radicalised\">gone further</a>, upending longstanding US support and ensnaring the agency in a wider campaign.</p> <p>In January 2018, Washington abruptly cut $365m (\u00a3278m) in funding to the agency, barely a month after Trump declared he was moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem \u2013 a cherished Israeli objective.</p> <p>Then, in March this year,the US recognised Israel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/13/us-describes-golan-heights-as-israeli-controlled-not-israeli-occupied\">illegal annexation</a> of the occupied Golan Heights. And in November the US \u201cdeclared\u201d that Jewish settlements were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/18/settlements-israeli-calls-for-takeover-palestinian-territories\">not inconsistent</a> with international law, thus condoning multiple violations of the Geneva conventions.</p> <p>These moves were cost-free to Israel: Washington demanded nothing in return. And just a few days ago Netanyahu reportedly urged US support for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/10/netanyahu-vows-annex-large-parts-occupied-west-bank-trump\">illegal annexation plans</a> for the Jordan valley, where an estimated 65,000 Palestinians live, alongside more than 10,000 Jewish settlers on land also seized in contravention of international law.</p> <p>Three divisive \u201cfinal status\u201d issues are being unilaterally \u201creshaped\u201d in Israel\u2019s favour: Jerusalem, refugees and settlements.</p> <p>If the UNRWA is an integral part of this ill-judged diplomacy, the news \u2013 while dispiriting \u2013 has not been entirely bleak. The international community, in the shape of the UN general assembly, has pushed back. No fewer than 170 members of the assembly recently voted to renew the UNRWA\u2019s mandate for three years.</p> <p>Only two countries voted against \u2013 the US and Israel \u2013 which had been hoping to use the mandate renewal debate to change the definition of Palestinian refugees, airbrushing them from history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44125a3d4e950c08145e9b13473cb197b6ff67d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44125a3d4e950c08145e9b13473cb197b6ff67d9/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students at a school run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in Gaza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students at a school run by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees take part in the Birds of Peace in the Land of Peace festival in Gaza.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: APA Images/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the UNRWA, victory at the assembly has specific significance.</p> <p>In the run-up to the vote the agency was plagued by allegations of mismanagement limited to a small group of officials in its executive office, which saw the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/06/pierre-krahenbuhl-steps-down-head-un-agency-palestinian-refugees-investigation\">executive head resign</a>.</p> <p> The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, appointed as interim chief one of the most senior British officials in the UN system, Christian Saunders, who was asked to set the UNRWA on a new path.</p> <p>The overwhelming result in the assembly is a sign that the UNRWA is turning the corner. Moreover, it is a vote of confidence in the agency\u2019s undeniable successes. Its schools for half a million students across the Middle East consistently outperform those of host governments; the UNRWA \u201cemergency education\u201d programme is being rolled out globally by Unicef; and the agency\u2019s internet-based postnatal care and immunisation work are trailblazing.</p> <p>So what\u2019s next for an agency whose mandate lies at the heart of the Middle East peace process \u2013 and to which Britain has become the fourth largest donor?</p> <p>After the twin shocks of US defunding and its internal crisis, the UNRWA must shore up the confidence of its main donors and secure an additional $167m to protect vital services, including emergency aid in wartorn Syria and educating 280,000 children in the illegally blockaded Gaza Strip.</p> <p>Just as important, the UNRWA must restore credibility with the Palestinians it serves, reconnecting the agency with its history and mandate. It must engage in rights-based protection advocacy, reminding the world community of the historic injustices that led to its creation.</p> <p>These are the most effective long-term answers to the ongoing political attacks on the UNRWA, and an essential response to Washington\u2019s bid to deprive millions of Palestinians of their rights, history and identity. Moreover, it is recognition of an inescapable conclusion, a truth anyone engaging in Middle East diplomacy should take to heart: Palestinian rights are not for sale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/27/the-palestinian-entrepreneur-bringing-power-to-gaza-majd-mashharawi\">The Palestinian entrepreneur bringing power to Gaza</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moving forward, a fully-funded UNRWA \u2013 supported by longstanding donors such as Britain \u2013 must continue to deliver a full range of human development and emergency services.

It has become a key battleground in Donald Trump\u2019s war against multilateralism and his unilateral attempts to redefine the Middle East peace process along a track proposed by Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Meanwhile, the UNRWA has become embroiled in its own damaging scandals. The agency was born on the ashes of the 1948 Middle East war that saw the state of Israel established and Palestinian society dismantled with 750,000 people displaced and more than 500 Palestinian villages destroyed. Today, the UN general assembly mandates the UNRWA to deliver services to more than 5 million Palestinian refugees \u2013 the world\u2019s largest and arguably most vulnerable refugee population \u2013 until that historic injustice is redressed. While it has long been in the sights of Israel, with Netanyahu calling for the UNRWA to be \u201cdismantled\u201d as early as 2016, the Trump administration has gone further, upending longstanding US support and ensnaring the agency in a wider campaign. In January 2018, Washington abruptly cut $365m (\u00a3278m) in funding to the agency, barely a month after Trump declared he was moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem \u2013 a cherished Israeli objective. Then, in March this year,the US recognised Israel\u2019s illegal annexation of the occupied Golan Heights. And in November the US \u201cdeclared\u201d that Jewish settlements were not inconsistent with international law, thus condoning multiple violations of the Geneva conventions. These moves were cost-free to Israel: Washington demanded nothing in return. And just a few days ago Netanyahu reportedly urged US support for his illegal annexation plans for the Jordan valley, where an estimated 65,000 Palestinians live, alongside more than 10,000 Jewish settlers on land also seized in contravention of international law. Three divisive \u201cfinal status\u201d issues are being unilaterally \u201creshaped\u201d in Israel\u2019s favour: Jerusalem, refugees and settlements. If the UNRWA is an integral part of this ill-judged diplomacy, the news \u2013 while dispiriting \u2013 has not been entirely bleak. The international community, in the shape of the UN general assembly, has pushed back. No fewer than 170 members of the assembly recently voted to renew the UNRWA\u2019s mandate for three years. Only two countries voted against \u2013 the US and Israel \u2013 which had been hoping to use the mandate renewal debate to change the definition of Palestinian refugees, airbrushing them from history. For the UNRWA, victory at the assembly has specific significance. In the run-up to the vote the agency was plagued by allegations of mismanagement limited to a small group of officials in its executive office, which saw the executive head resign. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, appointed as interim chief one of the most senior British officials in the UN system, Christian Saunders, who was asked to set the UNRWA on a new path. The overwhelming result in the assembly is a sign that the UNRWA is turning the corner. Moreover, it is a vote of confidence in the agency\u2019s undeniable successes. Its schools for half a million students across the Middle East consistently outperform those of host governments; the UNRWA \u201cemergency education\u201d programme is being rolled out globally by Unicef; and the agency\u2019s internet-based postnatal care and immunisation work are trailblazing. So what\u2019s next for an agency whose mandate lies at the heart of the Middle East peace process \u2013 and to which Britain has become the fourth largest donor? After the twin shocks of US defunding and its internal crisis, the UNRWA must shore up the confidence of its main donors and secure an additional $167m to protect vital services, including emergency aid in wartorn Syria and educating 280,000 children in the illegally blockaded Gaza Strip. Just as important, the UNRWA must restore credibility with the Palestinians it serves, reconnecting the agency with its history and mandate. It must engage in rights-based protection advocacy, reminding the world community of the historic injustices that led to its creation. These are the most effective long-term answers to the ongoing political attacks on the UNRWA, and an essential response to Washington\u2019s bid to deprive millions of Palestinians of their rights, history and identity. Moreover, it is recognition of an inescapable conclusion, a truth anyone engaging in Middle East diplomacy should take to heart: Palestinian rights are not for sale. Moving forward, a fully-funded UNRWA \u2013 supported by longstanding donors such as Britain \u2013 must continue to deliver a full range of human development and emergency services. This is an obligation, not a choice, for UN member states whose responsibilities to the Palestinians, given the UN\u2019s historic involvement, have no statute of limitation. Something greater than stability in the Middle East is at stake. Continued support for the UNRWA is a singularly important defence against attacks on multilateralism and human rights, both grounded in the values engendered by the atrocities of the second world war. This at a time when unilateral, populist forces in the US, Israel and elsewhere are attempting to erase the dignity and humanity of a people whose future is intimately bound up with peace in the Middle East and beyond. Timely support for the UNRWA \u2013 financial and diplomatic \u2013 is one area, one small area, where a crucial battle, if not the war, can and must be won. \u2022 Chris Gunness is a journalist and broadcaster, and a former UNRWA director of communications",

It was the first and only firm to run Britain\u2019s main intercity service since privatisation.</p> <p>Now, though, Virgin has been ejected in favour of First Trenitalia, some seven years after rival FirstGroup thought it had won the franchise. Instead, in 2012 Virgin \u2013 the champion of competition \u2013 cried foul and called the lawyers, and has sat prettily ever since on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/06/virgin-rail-west-coast-mainline\" title=\"\">a string of direct contract awards</a> from a befuddled Department for Transport.</p> <p>The ironies do not stop there.

In some respects this works for the nation, but in many ways it does not.</p> <p>Last week official figures showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/05/gap-between-rich-and-poor-grows-alongside-rise-in-uks-total-wealth\" title=\"\">the nation\u2019s wealth grew to a record high</a> in the two years to 2018, adding to strong gains made in the years since the 2008 financial crash and almost uninterrupted increases ever since the 1970s.</p> <p>In the mid-1970s, the UK\u2019s wealth equated to three times national annual income (GDP). By 2008, that ratio had risen to 5.5 times and now it stands at seven times GDP. In the 10 years to 2018, typical household incomes have increased by just 6% in real terms, while typical household wealth has gone up by 18%.</p> <p>The best that can be said for our wealth is that it provides an asset from which to borrow money. There has also been a trend for selling ever-inflating assets to fill the 4-5% <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/sep/18/fixing-a-hole-why-uk-current-account-deficit-needs-urgent-attention\" title=\"\">shortfall in the UK\u2019s balance of payments each year</a>.</p> <p>However, wealth is pernicious in the way it divides communities and rewards those who would profit from buying assets only to milk them for an income while paying a tax at a rate lower than the equivalent income tax. The emphasis on building up wealth and assets \u2013 and if possible extracting an income from them \u2013 is also a reflection of the low wage rises on offer to those who make their income from work.</p> <p>The situation has improved over the past couple of years, with a spread of wealth to millions of lower-income workers via their occupational pension schemes. The expansion has happened so rapidly that private pension wealth has become the largest component of overall wealth \u2013 marginally bigger than property wealth.</p> <p>To some extent this reflects a slight cooling in the housing market, but an extension of wealth to lower-income groups must be welcome.</p>",

Instead, in 2012 Virgin \u2013 the champion of competition \u2013 cried foul and called the lawyers, and has sat prettily ever since on a string of direct contract awards from a befuddled Department for Transport. The ironies do not stop there. Virgin later proved to have overbid to win the east coast franchise, and its default on payments led to it being taken over by the UK state operator, LNER. And the death of Virgin Trains also marks the end of transport firm Stagecoach\u2019s interests in rail, as it follows National Express back to busland. The founding myths of private rail \u2013 of the efficiency and flair that would vanquish British Rail\u2019s curled-up sandwiches and associated public sector failings \u2013 are still aired. Yet with the handover of West Coast, as few as 7% of domestic journeys will take place on trains operated entirely by private firms. First\u2019s partner Trenitalia is run by the Italian state, and state-owned firms from Germany, France, the Netherlands and beyond have a hand in virtually all British franchises, bar just two operated by First alone. Virgin and Stagecoach extracted more than \u00a3600m in dividends. That is money that Labour argues the taxpayer could keep if services were renationalised \u2013 and unless the remaining private operations demonstrate a spectacular improvement, the question might increasingly be: why not? Britain gets wealthier, and more divided Britain has for decades lived off its wealth. In some respects this works for the nation, but in many ways it does not. Last week official figures showed that the nation\u2019s wealth grew to a record high in the two years to 2018, adding to strong gains made in the years since the 2008 financial crash and almost uninterrupted increases ever since the 1970s. In the mid-1970s, the UK\u2019s wealth equated to three times national annual income (GDP). By 2008, that ratio had risen to 5.5 times and now it stands at seven times GDP. In the 10 years to 2018, typical household incomes have increased by just 6% in real terms, while typical household wealth has gone up by 18%. The best that can be said for our wealth is that it provides an asset from which to borrow money. There has also been a trend for selling ever-inflating assets to fill the 4-5% shortfall in the UK\u2019s balance of payments each year. However, wealth is pernicious in the way it divides communities and rewards those who would profit from buying assets only to milk them for an income while paying a tax at a rate lower than the equivalent income tax. The emphasis on building up wealth and assets \u2013 and if possible extracting an income from them \u2013 is also a reflection of the low wage rises on offer to those who make their income from work. The situation has improved over the past couple of years, with a spread of wealth to millions of lower-income workers via their occupational pension schemes. The expansion has happened so rapidly that private pension wealth has become the largest component of overall wealth \u2013 marginally bigger than property wealth. To some extent this reflects a slight cooling in the housing market, but an extension of wealth to lower-income groups must be welcome.",

In fact they are shots of an off-grid punk community in the Yukon, almost unreachably remote, hidden like snow leopards in plain sight. Some of the films here are striking for their brevity and punch, particularly Louis Blue Newby\u2019s outstandingly eerie remake of a scene from David Cronenberg\u2019s Crash from a queer perspective. But the outstanding film work here is almost static, and intentionally so \u2013 Louiza Ntourou\u2019s exquisitely contemplative closeup of a single leaf pictured against a glowing sky between two trees. It scarcely moves in time or space, held aloft by the breeze like a detail in a Japanese watercolour. It\u2019s titled Once Upon a Time, a Time That Never Was and Always Is. Ntourou is Greek. The 45 artists in this exhibition come from Russia, Hong Kong, Japan, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Brazil, as well as Northallerton and Ipswich. Never forget how international is the British art scene. Nearly all are still in their early 20s and they come from dozens of art schools around the country. Of course there are callow and unfulfilled works in this show. And of course the range depends not just upon the taste of the selectors \u2013 in this case the artists Rana Begum, Ben Rivers and Sonia Boyce \u2013 but on those who appointed the panel. But what\u2019s remarkable is just how rapidly you cease to think of these Bloomberg New Contemporaries as recent students at all, seeing them instead as independent minds producing compelling new art. Bloomberg New Contemporaries 2019 is at the South London Gallery (Peckham Road, London SE5 and Fire Station, SE15) until 23 February 2020",

New data collected over the past nine years by the Sambhavna Trust suggests that even after three decades, the mortality rate for gas-exposed victims is still 28% higher than average. They are twice as likely to die of cancers, diseases of the lungs and tuberculosis, three times as likely to die from kidney diseases and 63% more likely to have illnesses. The Trust\u2019s data also highlights the fact that over the past three years, almost a quarter of gas exposed victims were diagnosed with an under-active thyroid, which can have devastating long term health impacts. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9db1927edd1af9275292a3af474d9b9fc98ab738\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9db1927edd1af9275292a3af474d9b9fc98ab738/0_27_3726_2237/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hundreds of thousands of people were exposed to toxic chemicals as a result of the disaster, leading to cases of cancer, stillbirths, miscarriages, lung and heart disease.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hundreds of thousands of people were exposed to toxic chemicals as a result of the disaster, leading to cases of cancer, stillbirths, miscarriages, lung and heart disease.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Indranil Mukherjee/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The data also suggests that the explosion has had a particularly adverse effect on women exposed to the gas, even as babies just days old, causing high rates of infertility, stillbirths, abortions, early menopause and wreaking havoc on menstrual cycles. As a result, many women in Bhopal continue to be abandoned by their husbands, believed not to be capable of fulfilling the familial duties expected of them.</p> <p>Yet it is the lasting impact on the second and third generation, and on those yet unborn that haunts those in Bhopal the most. The Chingari children\u2019s centre, established for those born with disabilities as a consequence of the disaster, has registered over 1,000 children, with most affected by cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, autism, intellectual disabilities and severe learning difficulties. \u201cThis is the terrible legacy of Bhopal: all of these children were born to parents, or even grandparents, who were in contact with the gas that night,\u201d said Rashida Bee, the centre\u2019s founder. \u201cThe situation is getting worse, not better. We are seeing more and more second and third generation children being born with such disabilities and coming here.

Proof of the lasting damage of the gas exposure could have major legal implications for Union Carbide and its current owner Dow Chemicals, who took ownership of the company and its legal responsibilities in 2001, in terms of compensation liability. A civil court case, begun in 2010, is ongoing in the supreme court, which is arguing to re-open the compensation case for victims of Bhopal.</p> <p>Indeed, one recent rare study authorised by government medical body the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), found that between 2016-2017, 9% of the babies born to gas-exposed mothers had birth defects compared to 1.3% born to mothers with no exposure. However, the study was subsequently discredited by the ICMR, who ordered it not to be published or disclosed.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the beginning the government has protected the corporations at the cost of human lives,\u201d says Satinash Sarangi, founder of the Sambhanva Trust which runs an medical clinic that has treated over 300,000 Bhopal victims. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the trust, which was established entirely on the basis of donations given by thousands of Guardian readers who responded to a newspaper advert by the <a href=\"http://www.bhopal.org/donate/\">Bhopal Medical Appeal</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"616e539a41dd4d7cf0557e7ec77c09400edbe532\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/616e539a41dd4d7cf0557e7ec77c09400edbe532/0_0_4005_2658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A machine inside one of the buildings at the now-defunct Union Carbide pesticide factory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A machine inside one of the buildings at the defunct Union Carbide pesticide factory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Indranil Mukherjee/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sarangi set up the clinic after several incidents convinced him the government were not giving Bhopal victims the correct treatment or information in a bid to disguise the lasting scale of the tragedy.

Walking into the hut where where Yikas, 21, and Aman, 19, lie side-by-side on the floor on a pink woven mat, she breaks down.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every day we are punished while the companies and the government have got away with doing nothing for 35 years</p> <footer> <cite>Sanjay Yadav</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Both born severely disabled by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the severity of the boys\u2019 condition is on stark display. They are unable to walk, talk or eat without assistance; their frail limbs splay out at awkward angles. Their grandmother sits in between them, strokes their heads and whispers gently in their ears. Looking up Yadav gestures at the boys, \u201cIs this a life?\u201d she asks, furiously wiping away her tears.</p> <p>Their mother Sharda Yadav, 41, who was 12 years old when she was exposed to the gas from the explosion, fiddles with her canary yellow sari in distress. \u201cDoctors told us secretly this is because of the gas,\u201d she whispers. \u201cThey are adult men, they should be standing shoulder to shoulder with their father, but look at them.

I feel a pain in my soul when I look at them.\u201d</p> <p>A tsunami of grief engulfs the small hut, as mother, father, grandmother and grandfather all quietly sob. Lying on the floor before them, Yikas lets out a gentle wail, his only means of communicating with his family. Their father Sanjay Yadav shook his head. \u201cEvery day we are punished,\u201d he says, \u201cwhile the companies and the government have got away with doing nothing for 35 years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6367685e66a6e0662727ce749bcc0d096fe09c7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6367685e66a6e0662727ce749bcc0d096fe09c7b/0_30_3130_1877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No cleanup operation of the chemical contamination around the former factory has ever been conducted.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No cleanup operation of the chemical contamination around the former factory has ever been conducted.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Indranil Mukherjee/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Justice has indeed remained elusive for the victims of Bhopal.

On six separate occasions between 2014 and 2019, the US Department of Justice has simply not passed on the summons for Dow Chemical to appear in the Bhopal Court on criminal charges of sheltering a fugitive, their subsidiary company Union Carbide. This is seen by campaigners as a direct violation of the treaty of mutual legal assistance between the US and India, and has ensured Dow Chemical has never appeared in the courts to answer the criminal charges.</p> <p>In a statement, the department of justice said they did not \u201cpublicly comment on communications with foreign governments on investigative matters, including confirming or denying the very existence of such communications.\u201d</p> <p>The Indian government has also been accused of working against the victims by kowtowing to corporate interests.

Surveys done by the Bhopal campaign groups have shown this toxic waste, which according to their tests contains six of the persistent organic pollutants banned by the UN for their highly poisonous impacts on the environment and human health, has now reached 42 areas in Bhopal and continues to spread. The pond where Union Carbide used to dump the chemicals sits festering and untouched, with children and wild pigs running on about on its banks. State officials have long disputed that this waste has any harmful impact, accusing activists of inventing it to get charity funding; offers by the UN and the German government to carry out tests and clear it up have been refused by the Indian government. However, SR Mohanty, chief secretary of the energy department for the state government, told the Guardian that plans have finally been made to carry out a toxicity assessment in the coming months. The Guardian can also reveal the role the US government has played \u2013 and continues to play \u2013 in obstructing justice for the Bhopal victims, in order to protect American corporate giants Union Carbide and its now owner Dow Chemicals. Those who did not initially perish in the blast live with a toxic sword of Damocles over their heads. New data collected over the past nine years by the Sambhavna Trust suggests that even after three decades, the mortality rate for gas-exposed victims is still 28% higher than average. They are twice as likely to die of cancers, diseases of the lungs and tuberculosis, three times as likely to die from kidney diseases and 63% more likely to have illnesses.

As a result, many women in Bhopal continue to be abandoned by their husbands, believed not to be capable of fulfilling the familial duties expected of them. Yet it is the lasting impact on the second and third generation, and on those yet unborn that haunts those in Bhopal the most. The Chingari children\u2019s centre, established for those born with disabilities as a consequence of the disaster, has registered over 1,000 children, with most affected by cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, autism, intellectual disabilities and severe learning difficulties. \u201cThis is the terrible legacy of Bhopal: all of these children were born to parents, or even grandparents, who were in contact with the gas that night,\u201d said Rashida Bee, the centre\u2019s founder. \u201cThe situation is getting worse, not better. We are seeing more and more second and third generation children being born with such disabilities and coming here. Bhopal\u2019s tragedy has not stopped.\u201d Activists allege that there has been a deliberate suppression by the Indian government of any research which proves the long term systemic or genetic damage caused by the gas explosion, to protect the corporations involved. Proof of the lasting damage of the gas exposure could have major legal implications for Union Carbide and its current owner Dow Chemicals, who took ownership of the company and its legal responsibilities in 2001, in terms of compensation liability. A civil court case, begun in 2010, is ongoing in the supreme court, which is arguing to re-open the compensation case for victims of Bhopal. Indeed, one recent rare study authorised by government medical body the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), found that between 2016-2017, 9% of the babies born to gas-exposed mothers had birth defects compared to 1.3% born to mothers with no exposure. However, the study was subsequently discredited by the ICMR, who ordered it not to be published or disclosed. \u201cFrom the beginning the government has protected the corporations at the cost of human lives,\u201d says Satinash Sarangi, founder of the Sambhanva Trust which runs an medical clinic that has treated over 300,000 Bhopal victims. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the trust, which was established entirely on the basis of donations given by thousands of Guardian readers who responded to a newspaper advert by the Bhopal Medical Appeal. Sarangi set up the clinic after several incidents convinced him the government were not giving Bhopal victims the correct treatment or information in a bid to disguise the lasting scale of the tragedy. Even today, in government-run hospitals, doctors will not acknowledge if victim\u2019s diseases or disabilities are gas-related. \u201cIt has become obvious to me this is never about medicine and people, it is about politics and power,\u201d Sarangi says. Omwati Yadav\u2019s two grandsons, born to a mother and father who were both exposed to the gas, are among the second generation victims of Bhopal. Walking into the hut where where Yikas, 21, and Aman, 19, lie side-by-side on the floor on a pink woven mat, she breaks down. Both born severely disabled by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the severity of the boys\u2019 condition is on stark display. They are unable to walk, talk or eat without assistance; their frail limbs splay out at awkward angles. Their grandmother sits in between them, strokes their heads and whispers gently in their ears. Looking up Yadav gestures at the boys, \u201cIs this a life?\u201d she asks, furiously wiping away her tears. Their mother Sharda Yadav, 41, who was 12 years old when she was exposed to the gas from the explosion, fiddles with her canary yellow sari in distress. \u201cDoctors told us secretly this is because of the gas,\u201d she whispers. \u201cThey are adult men, they should be standing shoulder to shoulder with their father, but look at them. The do not even know if it is day or night, I have spent my whole life taking care of them but I get sick most of the time. I feel a pain in my soul when I look at them.\u201d A tsunami of grief engulfs the small hut, as mother, father, grandmother and grandfather all quietly sob. Lying on the floor before them, Yikas lets out a gentle wail, his only means of communicating with his family. Their father Sanjay Yadav shook his head. \u201cEvery day we are punished,\u201d he says, \u201cwhile the companies and the government have got away with doing nothing for 35 years.\u201d Justice has indeed remained elusive for the victims of Bhopal. A 1989 compensation deal, now widely panned as shamefully inadequate, saw most victims given just 25,000 rupees (\u00a3275), while some received nothing at all. None of the nine Indian officials who were convicted in 2010 for their role in the disaster served any time behind bars, while Union Carbide has never appeared in court. Lingering behind the scenes has been the shadowy hand of the US government, who, throughout three decades of administrations, have repeatedly intervened to shade Union Carbide and more recently its owner Dow Chemicals, from legal liability, according to documents seen by the Guardian. In 2003, when an extradition request was sent to the US for Union Carbide CEO Warren Anderson to be extradited to India to face trial, emails released through freedom of information reveal that secretary of state Colin Powell and figures at the state department emphasised \u201cthe importance of this issue to the US business community\u201d and various officials at Union Carbide met with officials at the US state department. The extradition request was later declined. Classified emails released as part of WikiLeaks show that in 2010, when the Indian government pushed to reopen the compensation settlement for Bhopal victims, Robert Hormats, who served as President Obama\u2019s under secretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment, met with then Indian cabinet minister Montek Ahluwalia to communicate that it would \u201clook really bad to reopen a settlement\u201d. Hormats is now vice president of Kissinger Associates, the geopolitical consulting firm set up by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, who took on Union Carbide as a client following the disaster and lobbied on their behalf for years after. State department documents also reveal that in his 2010 visit to India, President Barack Obama specifically did not meet with NGOs dealing with Bhopal out of fear of stoking the issue and that a key objective of the visit was instead to stress his \u201csupport for Dow\u2019s business in India.\u201d US government intervention continues to this day. On six separate occasions between 2014 and 2019, the US Department of Justice has simply not passed on the summons for Dow Chemical to appear in the Bhopal Court on criminal charges of sheltering a fugitive, their subsidiary company Union Carbide. This is seen by campaigners as a direct violation of the treaty of mutual legal assistance between the US and India, and has ensured Dow Chemical has never appeared in the courts to answer the criminal charges. In a statement, the department of justice said they did not \u201cpublicly comment on communications with foreign governments on investigative matters, including confirming or denying the very existence of such communications.\u201d The Indian government has also been accused of working against the victims by kowtowing to corporate interests. In 2015, while on a visit to the US, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi met with officials from Dow Chemicals. Contacted by the Guardian for this story, Dharmendra Kumar Madan, joint secretary at the ministry of chemicals, which is responsible for Bhopal, refused to comment, stating simply: \u201cI am not concerned with this issue.\u201d Even the smaller indignities suffered by Bhopal victims are relentless in their absurdity. A rare state government scheme to assist victims saw a series of yoga centres built to encourage a holistic approach to helping their pain. But no yoga teachers were ever hired and the centres now operate as high end wedding venues. There are ongoing plans to clear only a small portion of the toxic waste so a high-end Delhi architecture firm can build a Bhopal memorial. Each anniversary brings a smaller onslaught of attention to Bhopal but the tragedy remains the same. In JP Nagar, eight people have died in the past two months of diseases related to gas exposure, including two of the key activists who have led the fight for justice for Bhopal. Sitting in her small home, furnished only with a wardrobe and a single plastic chair, Leela Bai Ahivwar, 70, still remembers the night of the explosion with anguish and said the past 35 years since has been \u201conly pain\u201d. She lost both her son and daughter to diseases connected to their gas exposure. \u201cI no longer have any hope for justice. We walked to Delhi twice in protest, and for what,\u201d says Ahivwar. \u201cAlmost everyone is gone now. Maybe at last it will be my turn next.\u201d Another Bhopal life then, defined only by death.

That Labour government happened only in his dreams and our abandoned page plans. This reminds us that the results of all of our recent elections have surprised expectations. This is not just because pollsters find it harder to get an accurate read on the electorate, pundits are often poor at deciphering the runes and voters have become less anchored to traditional allegiances. It is also because Britain\u2019s archaic electoral system means that fluctuations in the intentions of small numbers of people can have a wildly disproportionate impact on the outcome.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/06/johnson-v-corbyn-who-won-the-day\">Johnson v Corbyn: who won the final debate?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shift of a few percentage points of vote share either way between now and Thursday can make the difference between Boris Johnson being returned to Number 10 with something looking like a Tory landslide or Jeremy Corbyn negotiating with the Scottish Nationalists to cobble together support for a minority Labour government.</p> <p>If we take a step back from the campaign frenzy and try to contemplate this from a longer perspective, a Conservative victory will be the more remarkable result in the context of history. The Tories are making a very big ask. They are seeking a fourth consecutive term in power. This is a request that the British electorate has granted only once in the history of universal suffrage. The Conservatives have been in office for nearly a decade. That would be a patience-sapping age in reasonably good times. These have been hard times. Economic growth has been anaemic, real incomes have been largely stagnant and an austerity has been imposed on Britain that even some Tories now concede was overdone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mr Corbyn comes up on the doorstep more often than Brexit as the reason among traditional Labour voters to withhold their support</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since 2017, there have been a record number of ministerial resignations, a symptom of the uncivil war that has racked the Tories throughout the period. They have done little else than wrangle over Brexit while infecting the rest of the country with their party\u2019s toxic divisions. Many of their moderates have been purged or fled. Sir John Major, the longest-serving living Tory prime minister, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/06/john-major-backs-three-ex-tory-independents-in-election-campaign\" title=\"\">effectively disowned</a> his party. Michael Heseltine, deputy prime minister in Sir John\u2019s government, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/michael-heseltine-lib-dems-tactical-voting-plea-chuka-umunna\" title=\"\">campaigning</a> for the Lib Dems. In Boris Johnson, the Tories have a leader who can\u2019t or won\u2019t say precisely how many children he has fathered, a frontman with a fat back catalogue of incendiary and offensive remarks about key electoral groups and a candidate for the premiership who is laughed at by television audiences whenever the topic under discussion is trust. In normal circumstances, such a government under such a leader would be preparing itself for defeat and a well-earned stretch in opposition. Yet as we head into the climactic days of the campaign, it is the Tories who are the bookies\u2019 and pollsters\u2019 favourite to win. An obvious element of the explanation is Brexit, which has played better for the Conservatives than it has for their opponents. The most important structural development of the entire campaign came early when Nigel Farage, under great pressure from within his own faction, declared that the Brexit party was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/nov/11/nigel-farage-reveals-brexit-party-will-not-stand-in-317-tory-seats-video\" title=\"\">standing down</a> in all seats which had a Conservative MP. This accelerated the migration of Brexit party supporters towards the Conservatives, uniting most of the Leave tribe behind Boris Johnson.</p> <p>Of all the propagandising of this campaign, \u201cget Brexit done\u201d has cut through to the electorate more powerfully than anything else. This is an example of the potency of duplicitous tunes. As I\u2019ve written before, it is the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/24/there-is-no-more-deceptive-slogan-of-this-campaign-than-get-brexit-done\" title=\"\">mendacious slogan</a> of the entire campaign. The Brexit agony endures if Mr Johnson secures a majority. It will be the voters who have been deceived into thinking that the nightmare will be over who will end up being done. The most difficult chapters of the negotiations about the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU lie ahead of us, with a no-deal outcome a very live possibility. But in order to win a British election you don\u2019t have to be able to fool all of the people all of the time. You only have to fool enough of the people at election time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7c052a265f95001f7b44c38ecb112779520d727\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7c052a265f95001f7b44c38ecb112779520d727/0_34_986_592/500.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson: \u2018A candidate for the premiership who is laughed at by television audiences whenever the topic under discussion is trust.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Doing the fooling is always so much easier if you are up against an opponent with even less credibility than yourself. In Jeremy Corbyn, Labour offers a candidate for Number 10 who has achieved the astonishing feat of being even less trusted with the premiership than the incumbent. If the Tories win this election, no account of their victory will be complete without analysing the critical role played in that outcome by their greatest collaborators, the Corbynite cadre who control the Labour party. After nearly a decade of often chaotic, frequently failing and bitterly divided Conservative government that has presided over an era of austerity, this ought to have been an election the principal party of opposition had confident hopes of winning. Yet Labour ends this campaign as it began: trailing the Tories. Its fantastical wishlists of promises are not believed and it has a candidate for Downing Street who plumbs depths of unpopularity never previously visited by any British opposition leader.</p> <p>Labour has put on some vote share since the beginning of the campaign, mainly, it appears, by squeezing Remain support away from the Greens and the Lib Dems, but it has risen only slowly and from a low base. The positive reassessment of Mr Corbyn that his cheerleaders claimed would happen has yet to materialise. Unlike in 2017, his personal ratings have registered little improvement. Two and a half years on, he is no longer the novelty that he was to many voters last time around. They have got to know him a lot better and what they have got to know they have generally disliked. I have talked to Labour candidates, especially those trying to defend against the Tory assault in the \u201cred wall\u201d seats in the Midlands, the north of England and Wales. They report that Mr Corbyn comes up on the doorstep more often than Brexit as the reason among traditional Labour voters to withhold their support. This bleeds into attitudes towards Labour as a whole, as voters ask themselves what kind of party would persist with having a leader who has allowed the poisonous spread of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/seventy-labour-staffers-give-statements-to-antisemitism-inquiry\" title=\"\">antisemitism</a> and tells <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/05/jeremy-corbyn-defended-lie-watches-queens-speech-11275031/\" title=\"\">silly fibs</a> about watching the Queen\u2019s Christmas Day broadcast \u201cin the morning\u201d.</p> <p>Mr Corbyn and his friends have failed to turn Labour into a party capable of marshalling an election-winning coalition of support. Nor have they made it a party that non-partisan voters feel comfortable about seeing in office. An important consequence of this has been to weaken the potential effectiveness of anti-Tory tactical voting. At the election of 1997, tactical voting was sufficiently powerful to cost the Tories around 50 seats. Lib Dem supporters and swing voters were willing to lend a hand to Labour candidates because they didn\u2019t have serious problems with the idea of Tony Blair as prime minister. Encouraging tactical voting is much tougher when moderate voters have several extremely large problems with the idea of Jeremy Corbyn and his cabal getting their hands on the levers of power. The data suggest that a majority of Tory Remainers will stick with the Conservatives at this election. You have to suspect that these anti-Brexit Tories, a significant proportion of the electorate, might have been a lot more biddable to the Labour party were it under a more attractive kind of leadership with a more credible suite of policies.</p> <p>We should not rule out the possibility that there will be a swing to Labour in the closing days of the campaign, although it will have to be even more spectacular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2017/jun/08/live-uk-election-results-in-full-2017\" title=\"\">than in 2017</a> to deny a majority to the Conservatives. A late Labour surge may be more likely if the final polls suggest that the Tories are on their way to a substantial win. That might trigger a recoil against the spectre of a Johnson landslide that works to the benefit of Labour.</p> <p>Yet there is nothing to celebrate about Labour having to rely on this sort of desperate calculation to give itself any grounds for optimism. Against a near-decade-old Tory government led by a man regarded as a charlatan even by many of those who are about to vote for him, Labour should be ending this election with high hopes of forming a majority government. It is instead frantically hoping that it might mitigate the scale of its defeat or squeak into office as a minority government thanks to the vagaries of our antique electoral system. And if the Tories win a majority they have done nothing to deserve, the lasting legacy of Labour\u2019s Corbynite era will be another five years of Conservative government.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of my colleagues recently recalled that, in advance of the 2015 general election, we spent quite a lot of time preparing a run of spreads about what to expect from the Ed Miliband premiership. That Labour government happened only in his dreams and our abandoned page plans. This reminds us that the results of all of our recent elections have surprised expectations. This is not just because pollsters find it harder to get an accurate read on the electorate, pundits are often poor at deciphering the runes and voters have become less anchored to traditional allegiances. It is also because Britain\u2019s archaic electoral system means that fluctuations in the intentions of small numbers of people can have a wildly disproportionate impact on the outcome. The shift of a few percentage points of vote share either way between now and Thursday can make the difference between Boris Johnson being returned to Number 10 with something looking like a Tory landslide or Jeremy Corbyn negotiating with the Scottish Nationalists to cobble together support for a minority Labour government. If we take a step back from the campaign frenzy and try to contemplate this from a longer perspective, a Conservative victory will be the more remarkable result in the context of history. The Tories are making a very big ask. They are seeking a fourth consecutive term in power. This is a request that the British electorate has granted only once in the history of universal suffrage. The Conservatives have been in office for nearly a decade. That would be a patience-sapping age in reasonably good times. These have been hard times. Economic growth has been anaemic, real incomes have been largely stagnant and an austerity has been imposed on Britain that even some Tories now concede was overdone. Since 2017, there have been a record number of ministerial resignations, a symptom of the uncivil war that has racked the Tories throughout the period. They have done little else than wrangle over Brexit while infecting the rest of the country with their party\u2019s toxic divisions. Many of their moderates have been purged or fled. Sir John Major, the longest-serving living Tory prime minister, has effectively disowned his party. Michael Heseltine, deputy prime minister in Sir John\u2019s government, is campaigning for the Lib Dems. In Boris Johnson, the Tories have a leader who can\u2019t or won\u2019t say precisely how many children he has fathered, a frontman with a fat back catalogue of incendiary and offensive remarks about key electoral groups and a candidate for the premiership who is laughed at by television audiences whenever the topic under discussion is trust. In normal circumstances, such a government under such a leader would be preparing itself for defeat and a well-earned stretch in opposition. Yet as we head into the climactic days of the campaign, it is the Tories who are the bookies\u2019 and pollsters\u2019 favourite to win. An obvious element of the explanation is Brexit, which has played better for the Conservatives than it has for their opponents. The most important structural development of the entire campaign came early when Nigel Farage, under great pressure from within his own faction, declared that the Brexit party was standing down in all seats which had a Conservative MP. This accelerated the migration of Brexit party supporters towards the Conservatives, uniting most of the Leave tribe behind Boris Johnson. Of all the propagandising of this campaign, \u201cget Brexit done\u201d has cut through to the electorate more powerfully than anything else. This is an example of the potency of duplicitous tunes. As I\u2019ve written before, it is the most mendacious slogan of the entire campaign. The Brexit agony endures if Mr Johnson secures a majority. It will be the voters who have been deceived into thinking that the nightmare will be over who will end up being done. The most difficult chapters of the negotiations about the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU lie ahead of us, with a no-deal outcome a very live possibility. But in order to win a British election you don\u2019t have to be able to fool all of the people all of the time. You only have to fool enough of the people at election time. Doing the fooling is always so much easier if you are up against an opponent with even less credibility than yourself. In Jeremy Corbyn, Labour offers a candidate for Number 10 who has achieved the astonishing feat of being even less trusted with the premiership than the incumbent. If the Tories win this election, no account of their victory will be complete without analysing the critical role played in that outcome by their greatest collaborators, the Corbynite cadre who control the Labour party. After nearly a decade of often chaotic, frequently failing and bitterly divided Conservative government that has presided over an era of austerity, this ought to have been an election the principal party of opposition had confident hopes of winning. Yet Labour ends this campaign as it began: trailing the Tories. Its fantastical wishlists of promises are not believed and it has a candidate for Downing Street who plumbs depths of unpopularity never previously visited by any British opposition leader. Labour has put on some vote share since the beginning of the campaign, mainly, it appears, by squeezing Remain support away from the Greens and the Lib Dems, but it has risen only slowly and from a low base. The positive reassessment of Mr Corbyn that his cheerleaders claimed would happen has yet to materialise. Unlike in 2017, his personal ratings have registered little improvement. Two and a half years on, he is no longer the novelty that he was to many voters last time around. They have got to know him a lot better and what they have got to know they have generally disliked. I have talked to Labour candidates, especially those trying to defend against the Tory assault in the \u201cred wall\u201d seats in the Midlands, the north of England and Wales. They report that Mr Corbyn comes up on the doorstep more often than Brexit as the reason among traditional Labour voters to withhold their support. This bleeds into attitudes towards Labour as a whole, as voters ask themselves what kind of party would persist with having a leader who has allowed the poisonous spread of antisemitism and tells silly fibs about watching the Queen\u2019s Christmas Day broadcast \u201cin the morning\u201d. Mr Corbyn and his friends have failed to turn Labour into a party capable of marshalling an election-winning coalition of support. Nor have they made it a party that non-partisan voters feel comfortable about seeing in office. An important consequence of this has been to weaken the potential effectiveness of anti-Tory tactical voting. At the election of 1997, tactical voting was sufficiently powerful to cost the Tories around 50 seats. Lib Dem supporters and swing voters were willing to lend a hand to Labour candidates because they didn\u2019t have serious problems with the idea of Tony Blair as prime minister. Encouraging tactical voting is much tougher when moderate voters have several extremely large problems with the idea of Jeremy Corbyn and his cabal getting their hands on the levers of power. The data suggest that a majority of Tory Remainers will stick with the Conservatives at this election. You have to suspect that these anti-Brexit Tories, a significant proportion of the electorate, might have been a lot more biddable to the Labour party were it under a more attractive kind of leadership with a more credible suite of policies. We should not rule out the possibility that there will be a swing to Labour in the closing days of the campaign, although it will have to be even more spectacular than in 2017 to deny a majority to the Conservatives. A late Labour surge may be more likely if the final polls suggest that the Tories are on their way to a substantial win. That might trigger a recoil against the spectre of a Johnson landslide that works to the benefit of Labour. Yet there is nothing to celebrate about Labour having to rely on this sort of desperate calculation to give itself any grounds for optimism. Against a near-decade-old Tory government led by a man regarded as a charlatan even by many of those who are about to vote for him, Labour should be ending this election with high hopes of forming a majority government. It is instead frantically hoping that it might mitigate the scale of its defeat or squeak into office as a minority government thanks to the vagaries of our antique electoral system. And if the Tories win a majority they have done nothing to deserve, the lasting legacy of Labour\u2019s Corbynite era will be another five years of Conservative government. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

      "bodyText": "The truth about Christmas past is that the vegan was often sent to the Siberian end of the dining table with a nut roast for one. Happily, we\u2019re in 2019 and it doesn\u2019t have to be this way any more. These bold but comforting little dumplings are the perfect way to cut the ribbon on the Christmas meal, and are something that the whole family can both help to make and eat together. Christmas, after all, is about sharing \u2013 well, until it comes to the last dumpling, at least. Kimchi and tofu dumplings with dipping sauce Don\u2019t worry about your pleating skills: you can just press these little dumplings shut and they\u2019ll still look lovely. You\u2019ll need a food processor to make the filling, though. You can find gyoza wrappers in the freezer section of most Chinese shops or big supermarkets \u2013 I use Happy Belly gyoza skins, which are round and 10cm in diameter. If you can find only square ones, they\u2019ll work, too. Prep 30 min Cook 1 hr Makes About 30 For the dipping sauce 2 tbsp soy sauce 2 tbsp rice-wine vinegar 1 tbsp white-wine vinegar 1cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated For the dumplings 280g firm tofu, drained 250g good-quality vegan kimchi 1 tbsp rapeseed oil 10 spring onions, finely chopped Salt 30 gyoza (or wonton) wrappers, defrosted Black sesame seeds, to serve First, make up the dipping sauce by mixing all the ingredients in a small bowl, then put to one side. Cut the tofu into large pieces, then put in a food processor. Weigh out the kimchi \u2013 both cabbage and juice \u2013 add to the tofu, then blitz until the mixture resembles mince. Over a medium flame, heat the oil in a nonstick frying pan for which you have a lid. Once hot, add all but a small handful of the spring onions. Stir-fry for four to five minutes, until soft, then add the kimchi and tofu mixture and cook for 10 minutes, until the water disappears. Taste \u2013 you may need to add up to a teaspoon of salt, but this will depend on your kimchi, so add it bit by bit. Tip the mixture into a bowl, and wipe out the frying pan. For the dumplings, fill a small bowl with water. Take one wonton wrapper (cover the rest with a damp tea towel to stop them drying out). Wet the outside of the wrapper with a (clean) finger dipped in the water bowl. Put two heaped teaspoons of filling in the centre of the wrapper (or enough to be generous, but not so much that you can\u2019t handle the dumpling). Fold over the wrapper to enclose the filling, then press closed or pinch and pleat the wrapper, working from one side to the other, pressing out as much air as possible as you go. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling (congratulating yourself on the improvement of your pleating skills as time goes on). To cook the dumplings, heat a tablespoon of oil in the frying pan over a low flame. Once it\u2019s hot, add as many dumplings as will fit in a single layer on the base of the pan and fry for a minute or two, until their bottoms are golden. Gently flip over, turn down the heat, add five tablespoons of water and cover the pan with a lid. Steam for six to seven minutes, until the pastry is soft and the water has evaporated. Repeat with the remaining dumplings. Throw the reserved spring onions into the dipping sauce, then arrange the dumplings on plates, sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve with saucers of dipping sauce.

On a grey Thursday in the Welsh valleys, he is thoughtful and reflective as he ponders his unlikely journey to the top of a sport he barely played until adulthood. Six years ago, he was a professional rugby player for Neath, throwing a few arrows in his spare evenings. This week, however, he will step out at Alexandra Palace in London as the coming force of darts: the two-time Grand Slam champion, the provisional world No 2 and one of the most electrifying and controversial characters in the sport.</p> <p>How it all happened is the question everyone wants to ask. He does not quite know the answer, but what he does know is that when he pulls that shiny shirt over his tightly coiled frame, it may as well be a superhero\u2019s cape, awakening something in him. The adrenalin begins to course. He is prone to bellow in opponents\u2019 faces at full volume. And he starts playing devastating darts. In a game dominated by psyche, Price has created a feared character with no apparent ceiling.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people can throw darts,\u201d explains Price. \u201cIt\u2019s just how they think about the game. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve improved. My mind is different.\u201d</p> <p>As recently as 18 months ago, the 34-year-old Price was still essentially a journeyman player with a few notable wins to his name. That all changed at last year\u2019s Grand Slam of Darts, when he beat double world champion Gary Anderson in a heated final \u2013 more on that in a sec \u2013 to win his first major TV title.</p> <p>Even more incredibly, he defended it last month, brushing aside the formidable world No 1, Michael van Gerwen, in the process. The Dutchman, still overwhelmingly the man to beat, firmly denies the upstart challenger has got into his head. Which is probably an admission that he has, a little bit.</p> <p>For Price, who turned professional in 2014, it comes down to ambition. \u201cEighteen months ago,\u201d he says, \u201cyou turn up and you\u2019re like: \u2018Just get through the first round.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t bothered about winning tournaments at the beginning. I just wanted to win enough money so I could stay on the tour, earn a living for my family. But then when you start to win, you just want more and more.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone has been thrilled by Price\u2019s rise. That first Grand Slam title was marred by a spat with Anderson, taking umbrage at his aggressive, extravagant celebrations. Price\u2019s first major trophy was awarded in a hailstorm of boos from the Wolverhampton crowd, his antics earning him the biggest fine issued in darts \u2013 \u00a321,500, later halved on appeal. His family have been targeted by social-media abuse. Fellow rising star Michael Smith has warned Price that he needs to \u201clearn when to shut up\u201d. Put it this way: in every walk of life, there are certain people who just seem calibrated to put noses out of joint. In darts, Price seems to be one of them.</p> <p>Very little of this abrasive stage persona survives the transition back to the real world. As we talk at his local golf club near Caerphilly, he reckons now that the whole bad boy of darts thing got a little out of hand. \u201cI\u2019m not the only person that shows emotion,\u201d he says. \u201cThe majority do and it\u2019s hard to hold back. People think I do it to put people off. I just need it to get myself going. It didn\u2019t really bother people when they were beating me.\u201d</p> <p>The great Sid Waddell once compared darts to a Christmas cracker: you need the wrapping on the outside just as much as the bang in the middle and for a sport still trying to fill its Phil Taylor-shaped void and desperately in search of new heroes and antiheroes, perhaps Price was just a handy heel. \u201cYou were turning up to games and one or two people would boo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThen a few more would join in. I was painted as the villain of darts. I accepted it to a certain extent. But it got a bit over the top.\u201d</p> <p>The low point came at last year\u2019s world championship, when Price was relentlessly barracked during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/21/pdc-world-darts-championship-day-nine-roundup-petersen-white-price-klaasen\" title=\"\">his second-round defeat to Nathan Aspinall</a>, his missed doubles cheered. Did it affect him? \u201cObviously you notice,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind booing through games. The crowd pay their money, and that\u2019s how you earn a living. I can take a bit of the pantomime villain. But if you\u2019re going for a double, that\u2019s when you should just get a little bit of respect.\u201d</p> <p>The irony is that taken in its entirety, Price\u2019s story is a rather uplifting tale: a testament to vision and opportunity, the courage to jack in one dream and pursue another. Having left school at 16 with aspirations of playing international rugby, Price represented Wales at all the age-group levels without quite fulfilling his potential at senior level. Aged 30, and with injuries piling up, he began to plot his next move. That was when a side door unexpectedly opened to him.</p> <p>Price hadn\u2019t thrown a dart until leaving school. There was a board in the bar of the local rugby club where he worked and occasionally if it was a quiet morning Price would have a little throw. He wasn\u2019t particularly good, but later he would start playing in the pub on Friday nights, and discovered he had a natural aptitude for the game.</p> <p>He won a cluster of local tournaments against grizzled veterans, went down to the PDC\u2019s qualifying school on a whim and to everyone\u2019s surprise, not least his own, scythed through the draw and won a tour card. </p> <p>Price hung up his boots, kissed goodbye to his modest Neath salary of around \u00a325,000, and threw himself into the arrows. He quickly found his first sporting career a valuable asset. Not only had it taught him the knack of raising his game under pressure, as well as the dangers of over-practice, but in a world of pot bellies and poor diets, Price\u2019s front-row physique actually provided him with something of an edge.</p> <p>\u201cOn Pro Tours [smaller weekend tournaments], it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when it comes to the big TV events, the longer formats, that\u2019s when it matters. It\u2019s hard to be carrying a lot of weight in the heat. You\u2019re going to be sweaty, your hands are going to be sweaty, you\u2019re not throwing the same darts because you haven\u2019t got the same grip. If you\u2019re overweight, those factors can put you off your game.\u201d</p> <p>With the world championship comprising a three-week slog in north London over the festive period, only the strongest will survive. Price has never gone beyond the last 16 at the Palace, but such has been his hot streak that bookmakers make it virtually a two-horse race between him and the redoubtable Van Gerwen, going for his fourth world crown. \u201cHe\u2019s the best player in the world, but he\u2019s there to be knocked off,\u201d Price insists. \u201cOn his day, he\u2019s practically unbeatable. But on my day, so am I.\u201d</p> <p>There are times, he admits, when the ex-rugby player line rankles with him slightly. \u201cThis rugby thing has got to be parked now,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing darts for six or seven years. I\u2019m a professional. That\u2019s how I\u2019d rather be known.\u201d</p> <p>If he ends up lifting the world championship trophy on 1 January, you suspect he\u2019ll get his wish.</p>",

Notices announced that no trains would be stopping there.</p> <p>In nearby villages, school buses continued their rounds, carrying only a handful of pupils to classes not cancelled by striking teachers, as thick fog descended over icy fields.</p> <p>While schools and colleges are expected to be open again this week, nobody can predict when normal public transport services will be resumed. Rail workers have declared their strikes \u201crenewable\u201d on an open-ended daily basis.</p> <p>Last Friday Philippe pointed out that the government had been consulting union and business leaders over pensions changes for almost two years in an attempt to clear the way for an agreement. Instead, like the freezing fog in the Yonne, the talks had left people cold and apprehensive.</p> <p>Recent opinion polls clouded the issue further, suggesting 76% of French people support the pensions overhaul but 64% say have no confidence in Macron to deliver it, while more than 50% believe the strikes are justified.</p> <p>On Friday, an Elys\u00e9e spokesman told journalists the president was anxious to \u201cdispel the fog\u201d surrounding the pension issue, an aim not helped by contradictory statements from ministers.</p> <p>Macron made shaking up France\u2019s arcane pension system a pillar of his 2017 presidential campaign. Now half-way through his five-year mandate, he has already faced down protests against his labour reforms and the overhaul of the state railway SNCF last year, and more than 12 months of <em>gilets jaunes</em> protests; but pension reform is the hill on which his administration has chosen to go down in history \u2013 in ignomy or glory.</p> <p>Macron wants to replace France\u2019s 42 pension schemes with a single \u201cuniversal\u201d points system that he argues will be fairer. At the heart of the dispute are the \u201cspecial regimes\u201d that afford certain public sector workers \u2013 including railway and other public transport staff \u2013 a number of <em>acquis</em> (rights) including early retirement and other benefits.</p> <p>Philippe said the new system would mean more equality between workers and would exchange \u201cthe solidarity with certain professions with a national solidarity\u201d. \u201cIt will enable each French person to pay in the same way and benefit from the same rights,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cFrance cannot accept in future these schemes that allow some to leave (work) earlier and with more than others.\u201d</p> <p>Janvier admitted the government\u2019s messages over pension reform had been confused and often contradictory, but said there was a determination to get the job done. \u201cThere\u2019s a willingness to carry out this reform, but we know it will be complicated. We said we would reform and reform we will, but there has to be agreement.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cThe approach has to be collective and not conflictual and it needs time and reasonable solutions. It\u2019s not something that can be delivered by forceps. But it has to be done.\u201d</p> <p>Grosset agreed that the current pension system was unjust, but added: \u201cThe government wants the same system for everyone, and why not? But there are people who stand to lose \u2013 not just transport workers, but teachers and nurses too. Their concerns must be addressed. Mr Macron promised to reform pensions in his election manifesto, but he also promised there would be no losers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d78f33bf3d4e31b28e20aee1c70b6197cd3628b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d78f33bf3d4e31b28e20aee1c70b6197cd3628b/0_0_5443_3267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors at a rally near the Place de la R\u00e9publique, Paris, in support of the national strike on 5 December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors at a rally near the Place de la R\u00e9publique, Paris, in support of the national strike on 5 December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kiran Ridley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He added the situation was unlike 1995, when plans to change France\u2019s welfare and pensions systems brought two million people onto the streets in almost a month of protests against President Jacques Chirac and his prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9. The reform was dropped.</p> <p>\u201cIn 1995, there wasn\u2019t Marine Le Pen waiting in the wings,\u201d Grosset said. \u201cThe ball is in the government\u2019s court. It may succeed in forcing the reforms though but if there is no dialogue, no attempt to compromise, just force, it will leave traces of rancour in the country, which it will pay for one day or another and most likely through the ballot box.\u201d</p> <p>France\u2019s biggest union, the CFDT, is broadly open to the idea of a points-based system if it applies only to those joining the workforce after 2025. Some government officials have hinted this could be pushed back even further to 2035. The more hardline CGT and Force Ouvri\u00e8re unions, which are stronger in the public sector, reject the reform wholesale and are preparing for a long fight.</p> <p>Daniel Fert\u00e9 of the FO railway workers\u2019 section said union members had the impression the government had \u201cheard nothing\u201d from last week\u2019s protests.</p> <p>The hard left leader of La France Insoumise, Jean Melenchon, was also in a fighting mood: \u201cPeople aren\u2019t demanding to be billionaires, they want to retire from work and be able to live with good health and dignity. It\u2019s really not that difficult.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday Joigny station was still deserted and the normally packed commuter car park dotted with few vehicles. Jean, a retired wholesale executive, was on his way to buy bread. He had no idea how the pension issue would play out. \u201cYou want me to predict what will happen next week in France? Can you predict what will happen with Brexit?\u201d he said. \u201cNo, me neither.\u201d</p> <p><strong>A Sisyphean task</strong><br></p> <p>Attempting to reform France\u2019s pension system has been likened to the job of poor Sisyphus, the mythical Greek king tasked with rolling an immense boulder up a hill only for it to roll back down again when it neared the top.</p> <p>For the Socialists, President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand lowered the retirement age from 65 to 60 when he took office in 1981.</p> <p>In 1995, President Jacques Chirac and his prime minister Alain Jupp\u00e9 tried to introduce a universal system and end the \u201cspecial regimes\u201d enjoyed by public sector workers. The attempt saw 2 million people take to the streets in almost a month protests. The reform was dropped.</p> <p>In 2010, President Nicolas Sarkozy raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, but only after a week of strikes, the blockading of oil refineries and nationwide protests.</p> <p>Emmanuel Macron\u2019s predecessor, the Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande promised to tackle the deficit in the pensions system, but ended up shying away from major changes after tens of thousands protested in Paris.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Emmanuel Macron will seek to placate angry strikers this week while honouring his election pledge to shake up France\u2019s pension system in a delicate balancing act that will define his political future. Ministers are looking at possible concessions that could defuse the strikes and protests that have paralysed the country since last week. Transport chaos continued this weekend and unions have called for another day of industrial action on Tuesday, putting further pressure on the government. After last-minute consultations, the prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe will give full details of the controversial changes to the country\u2019s pension schemes at midday on Wednesday. As hardline union leaders vowed to continue striking indefinitely, there were warnings that the country was entering a dangerous period. Caroline Janvier, who entered parliament as one of Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique en Marche \u201ccitizen\u201d MPs in the 2017 general election, denied the government was panicked but admitted it was \u201ca moment of apprehension for everyone\u201d. \u201cEveryone in the country is still traumatised by the gilets jaunes (yellow vest protesters) and concerned the violence will start again,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody wants a repeat of that.\u201d Jean Grosset, director of the social dialogue observatory at the Jean-Jaur\u00e8s Foundation, a left-wing think-tank, feared that if the government refused to compromise there would be long-term consequences. \u201cIf there\u2019s a hardening of attitudes in France it could create a perilous situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to have a social crisis because it results in people turning to more populist parties.\u201d In the town of Joigny \u2013 93 miles (150km) south-east of Paris in Yonne, the heart of the outer commuter belt around the French capital known as la France p\u00e9ripherique \u2013 the local railway station, like many in rural France, was deserted last Thursday. Notices announced that no trains would be stopping there. In nearby villages, school buses continued their rounds, carrying only a handful of pupils to classes not cancelled by striking teachers, as thick fog descended over icy fields. While schools and colleges are expected to be open again this week, nobody can predict when normal public transport services will be resumed. Rail workers have declared their strikes \u201crenewable\u201d on an open-ended daily basis. Last Friday Philippe pointed out that the government had been consulting union and business leaders over pensions changes for almost two years in an attempt to clear the way for an agreement. Instead, like the freezing fog in the Yonne, the talks had left people cold and apprehensive. Recent opinion polls clouded the issue further, suggesting 76% of French people support the pensions overhaul but 64% say have no confidence in Macron to deliver it, while more than 50% believe the strikes are justified. On Friday, an Elys\u00e9e spokesman told journalists the president was anxious to \u201cdispel the fog\u201d surrounding the pension issue, an aim not helped by contradictory statements from ministers. Macron made shaking up France\u2019s arcane pension system a pillar of his 2017 presidential campaign. Now half-way through his five-year mandate, he has already faced down protests against his labour reforms and the overhaul of the state railway SNCF last year, and more than 12 months of gilets jaunes protests; but pension reform is the hill on which his administration has chosen to go down in history \u2013 in ignomy or glory. Macron wants to replace France\u2019s 42 pension schemes with a single \u201cuniversal\u201d points system that he argues will be fairer. At the heart of the dispute are the \u201cspecial regimes\u201d that afford certain public sector workers \u2013 including railway and other public transport staff \u2013 a number of acquis (rights) including early retirement and other benefits. Philippe said the new system would mean more equality between workers and would exchange \u201cthe solidarity with certain professions with a national solidarity\u201d. \u201cIt will enable each French person to pay in the same way and benefit from the same rights,\u201d he said. \u201cFrance cannot accept in future these schemes that allow some to leave (work) earlier and with more than others.\u201d Janvier admitted the government\u2019s messages over pension reform had been confused and often contradictory, but said there was a determination to get the job done. \u201cThere\u2019s a willingness to carry out this reform, but we know it will be complicated. We said we would reform and reform we will, but there has to be agreement.\u201d She added: \u201cThe approach has to be collective and not conflictual and it needs time and reasonable solutions. It\u2019s not something that can be delivered by forceps. But it has to be done.\u201d Grosset agreed that the current pension system was unjust, but added: \u201cThe government wants the same system for everyone, and why not? But there are people who stand to lose \u2013 not just transport workers, but teachers and nurses too. Their concerns must be addressed. Mr Macron promised to reform pensions in his election manifesto, but he also promised there would be no losers.\u201d He added the situation was unlike 1995, when plans to change France\u2019s welfare and pensions systems brought two million people onto the streets in almost a month of protests against President Jacques Chirac and his prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9. The reform was dropped. \u201cIn 1995, there wasn\u2019t Marine Le Pen waiting in the wings,\u201d Grosset said. \u201cThe ball is in the government\u2019s court. It may succeed in forcing the reforms though but if there is no dialogue, no attempt to compromise, just force, it will leave traces of rancour in the country, which it will pay for one day or another and most likely through the ballot box.\u201d France\u2019s biggest union, the CFDT, is broadly open to the idea of a points-based system if it applies only to those joining the workforce after 2025. Some government officials have hinted this could be pushed back even further to 2035. The more hardline CGT and Force Ouvri\u00e8re unions, which are stronger in the public sector, reject the reform wholesale and are preparing for a long fight. Daniel Fert\u00e9 of the FO railway workers\u2019 section said union members had the impression the government had \u201cheard nothing\u201d from last week\u2019s protests. The hard left leader of La France Insoumise, Jean Melenchon, was also in a fighting mood: \u201cPeople aren\u2019t demanding to be billionaires, they want to retire from work and be able to live with good health and dignity. It\u2019s really not that difficult.\u201d On Friday Joigny station was still deserted and the normally packed commuter car park dotted with few vehicles. Jean, a retired wholesale executive, was on his way to buy bread. He had no idea how the pension issue would play out. \u201cYou want me to predict what will happen next week in France? Can you predict what will happen with Brexit?\u201d he said. \u201cNo, me neither.\u201d A Sisyphean task Attempting to reform France\u2019s pension system has been likened to the job of poor Sisyphus, the mythical Greek king tasked with rolling an immense boulder up a hill only for it to roll back down again when it neared the top. For the Socialists, President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand lowered the retirement age from 65 to 60 when he took office in 1981. In 1995, President Jacques Chirac and his prime minister Alain Jupp\u00e9 tried to introduce a universal system and end the \u201cspecial regimes\u201d enjoyed by public sector workers. The attempt saw 2 million people take to the streets in almost a month protests. The reform was dropped. In 2010, President Nicolas Sarkozy raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, but only after a week of strikes, the blockading of oil refineries and nationwide protests. Emmanuel Macron\u2019s predecessor, the Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande promised to tackle the deficit in the pensions system, but ended up shying away from major changes after tens of thousands protested in Paris.",

Graham\u2019s play offers a compromise, since the playwright will be asked to read out the exit poll results the minute the play finishes at 10pm.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not your average Christmas show, but the peculiarly twee way we run elections in this country means that many polling stations are in the same places that carol concerts and nativity plays are being staged,\u201d said Graham.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to bring people together and Josie and I also felt that the arts often departs too quickly from the political scene and just hands the baton to journalists and pundits.\u201d </p> <p>The play is again set in real time on the final 90 minutes of polling on election night in a marginal seat. In 2015, the original Donmar Warehouse production, labelled \u201ca glorious night at the polling station\u201d by the<em> Observer</em>, was broadcast live on More4 and nominated for a Bafta.</p> <p>\u201cWe enjoyed it so much the first time, we wanted to restage the whole exercise again,\u201d said Rourke.</p> <p>\u201cBut it was fascinating to see what had changed.\u201d</p> <p>The core mechanics of the play, its elements of farce, have endured, she added, because the key characters, the three clerks in the polling station and those who come in to vote, are limited in time and space.</p> <p>\u201cYet not only was the last time pre-European referendum, it was also at a time when people were still wondering about the possibility of a hung parliament and imagining what chaos that might bring,\u201d said Rourke this weekend ahead of the performance in the auditorium at Bush House on The Aldwych. \u201cJames is not looking to write a stinging political satire. He wants instead to be fair to all sides and so he remains hidden in the text.\u201d</p> <p>Graham agrees that the aim is to include people rather than divide them. \u201cIt is not all about Brexit this time, but of course it\u2019s there in the shadows, behind everything. It\u2019s why we are all here now.</p> <p>\u201cIn the 2015 version there was concern about the chaos that would come from a tight election result, with no majority. In the end, that didn\u2019t happen then, but we were still right because it was all to come.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The play The Vote, a 2015 theatrical experiment that also went out live on television on election night in 2015, is to be revived in updated form this week, the playwright James Graham and his co-creator and producer, Josie Rourke, have told the Observer. Stars Catherine Tate and Mark Gatiss will be back together on the evening of the general election this Thursday to perform Graham\u2019s 2019 version, along with a full cast including Bill Paterson and Nina Sosanya, for one night only in central London. Election night parties are thin on the ground and many voters will be looking for distraction. Graham\u2019s play offers a compromise, since the playwright will be asked to read out the exit poll results the minute the play finishes at 10pm. \u201cIt is not your average Christmas show, but the peculiarly twee way we run elections in this country means that many polling stations are in the same places that carol concerts and nativity plays are being staged,\u201d said Graham. \u201cWe wanted to bring people together and Josie and I also felt that the arts often departs too quickly from the political scene and just hands the baton to journalists and pundits.\u201d The play is again set in real time on the final 90 minutes of polling on election night in a marginal seat. In 2015, the original Donmar Warehouse production, labelled \u201ca glorious night at the polling station\u201d by the Observer, was broadcast live on More4 and nominated for a Bafta. \u201cWe enjoyed it so much the first time, we wanted to restage the whole exercise again,\u201d said Rourke. \u201cBut it was fascinating to see what had changed.\u201d The core mechanics of the play, its elements of farce, have endured, she added, because the key characters, the three clerks in the polling station and those who come in to vote, are limited in time and space. \u201cYet not only was the last time pre-European referendum, it was also at a time when people were still wondering about the possibility of a hung parliament and imagining what chaos that might bring,\u201d said Rourke this weekend ahead of the performance in the auditorium at Bush House on The Aldwych. \u201cJames is not looking to write a stinging political satire. He wants instead to be fair to all sides and so he remains hidden in the text.\u201d Graham agrees that the aim is to include people rather than divide them. \u201cIt is not all about Brexit this time, but of course it\u2019s there in the shadows, behind everything. It\u2019s why we are all here now. \u201cIn the 2015 version there was concern about the chaos that would come from a tight election result, with no majority. In the end, that didn\u2019t happen then, but we were still right because it was all to come.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>From the stream of misinformation to the absurd pledges, the 2019 election was the campaign that shame forgot \u2013 and the electorate wished they could do likewise.</p> <p>It has seen Labour and the Tories fight over whether antisemitism or Islamophobia was the less appealing quality in a potential party of government.

Having promised not to send a letter asking for a Brexit delay, which proved to be untrue, Boris Johnson piled into the election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/29/boris-johnson-makes-13bn-hospital-pledge-as-tory-party-conference-looms\" title=\"\">pledging 40 new hospitals</a> \u2013 untrue. He then made the untrue claim that there would be no checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, before stating that Labour would spend \u00a31.2 trillion, a claim that proved to be\u2026 you get the picture. Since then, many others have warmed to the theme. The top effort came from </em><em>Tory chairman James Cleverly,</em><em> who defended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/05/tories-unrepentant-about-doctored-video-of-keir-starmer-tv-appearance\" title=\"\">a video of Keir Starmer,</a> doctored to make it look </em><em>as if he couldn\u2019t answer questions on Brexit, by saying it was a joke. Cleverly\u2019s outrageous claim was never going to convince anyone \u2013 Labour\u2019s Brexit policy was a joke long before Tory HQ got involved.</em></p> <h2>Interview of the campaign</h2> <p><em>Look no further than Johnson\u2019s magisterial interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. He ducked, he swerved. Johnson ghosted past Neil like he wasn\u2019t even there! Because he wasn\u2019t. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/bbcs-andrew-neil-lays-down-gauntlet-to-boris-johnson-over-interview\" title=\"\">The interview hasn\u2019t happened,</a> owing to No 10\u2019s view that scrutiny is a quaint throwback to a time when prime ministers were expected to know the size of their immediate family. If Napoleon\u2019s advice was never to disrupt one\u2019s enemy when they are making a mistake, Tory advisers certainly aren\u2019t going to bother the electorate when they\u2019re on the cusp of a faceplant. Those inside the CCHQ bunker are terrified that even breathing out too conspicuously risks disrupting the inexplicable universal imbalance that has Johnson on course for Downing Street.</em></p> <h2>Policy of the campaign</h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/15/free-broadband-essential-uk-compete-john-mcdonnell-labour-policy-openreach\" title=\"\">Free broadband!</a> Billions for pensioners! </em><em>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell</em><em> has thrown the kitchen sink at convincing voters to back Labour \u2013 though the offer of free kitchen sinks is being held back for the last few days of the campaign.</em></p> <p><em>Should Labour win the election, Britain is either on course for socialist utopia \u2013 or it\u2019s about to become the nation-state version of the Fyre Festival. For the uninitiated, that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/apr/28/bahamas-drama-luxury-fyre-festival-turns-into-chaos\" title=\"\">a botched music event</a> which promised wealthy millennials the party of a lifetime on a paradise island. They arrived to find dystopian scenes of uninhabitable tents, sodden beds and shortages of food and water. The disaster was created by a messianic leader promising the earth, getting in way over his head and failing to change course when it was obvious his plans were unachievable. So there really aren\u2019t any obvious comparisons with Labour here.</em></p> <p><em>The sorry saga ends with the wealthy fleeing in their private jets, while the locals \u2013 who had hoped it would bring much needed prosperity \u2013 are left footing a big bill. I\u2019m still talking about Fyre Festival, obviously.</em></p> <h2>Claim of the campaign</h2> <p><em>Get Brexit Done.

      "bodyText": "From the stream of misinformation to the absurd pledges, the 2019 election was the campaign that shame forgot \u2013 and the electorate wished they could do likewise. It has seen Labour and the Tories fight over whether antisemitism or Islamophobia was the less appealing quality in a potential party of government. So divorced from reality have some protagonists become that one Tory minister said he didn\u2019t know whether Jeremy Corbyn actually planned to shoot rich people (it seems unlikely \u2013 the Labour leader has pledged to grow 2 billion extra trees and they aren\u2019t going to plant themselves). And while it is not unknown for anti-social behaviour to become an election issue, when one of the candidates is caught urinating in the street, it\u2019s probably time to pack the political class into a cab and send them home for their own good. If only that were an option. With the election days away, the result remains as unpredictable as a headcount of prime ministerial offspring. So, in the spirit of electoral masochism, the Observer looks back at the lowlights of the campaign in full. Theme of the campaign Disinformation. There was a time when the purveyors of fake news used sophisticated algorithms, rogue states and armies of online bots to propagate misleading nonsense. This was the election that proved they needn\u2019t have bothered. Much quicker to make the untruths front and centre of the campaign, pushed by a crack team of ministers chosen for their pliability, lack of wit and jaw-dropping shamelessness. Let\u2019s recap. Having promised not to send a letter asking for a Brexit delay, which proved to be untrue, Boris Johnson piled into the election pledging 40 new hospitals \u2013 untrue. He then made the untrue claim that there would be no checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, before stating that Labour would spend \u00a31.2 trillion, a claim that proved to be\u2026 you get the picture. Since then, many others have warmed to the theme. The top effort came from Tory chairman James Cleverly, who defended a video of Keir Starmer, doctored to make it look as if he couldn\u2019t answer questions on Brexit, by saying it was a joke. Cleverly\u2019s outrageous claim was never going to convince anyone \u2013 Labour\u2019s Brexit policy was a joke long before Tory HQ got involved. Interview of the campaign Look no further than Johnson\u2019s magisterial interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. He ducked, he swerved. Johnson ghosted past Neil like he wasn\u2019t even there! Because he wasn\u2019t. The interview hasn\u2019t happened, owing to No 10\u2019s view that scrutiny is a quaint throwback to a time when prime ministers were expected to know the size of their immediate family. If Napoleon\u2019s advice was never to disrupt one\u2019s enemy when they are making a mistake, Tory advisers certainly aren\u2019t going to bother the electorate when they\u2019re on the cusp of a faceplant. Those inside the CCHQ bunker are terrified that even breathing out too conspicuously risks disrupting the inexplicable universal imbalance that has Johnson on course for Downing Street. Policy of the campaign Free broadband! Billions for pensioners! Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has thrown the kitchen sink at convincing voters to back Labour \u2013 though the offer of free kitchen sinks is being held back for the last few days of the campaign. Should Labour win the election, Britain is either on course for socialist utopia \u2013 or it\u2019s about to become the nation-state version of the Fyre Festival. For the uninitiated, that was a botched music event which promised wealthy millennials the party of a lifetime on a paradise island. They arrived to find dystopian scenes of uninhabitable tents, sodden beds and shortages of food and water. The disaster was created by a messianic leader promising the earth, getting in way over his head and failing to change course when it was obvious his plans were unachievable. So there really aren\u2019t any obvious comparisons with Labour here. The sorry saga ends with the wealthy fleeing in their private jets, while the locals \u2013 who had hoped it would bring much needed prosperity \u2013 are left footing a big bill. I\u2019m still talking about Fyre Festival, obviously. Claim of the campaign Get Brexit Done. It\u2019s cobblers, of course, given that even if Johnson passes his Brexit agreement (aka the easy bit), it begins the painful business of deciding what life outside the EU will actually look like. But being untrue has morphed from a political problem to an absolute prerequisite in the Conservative soundbite stakes. The problem with Johnsonian misinformation is that it can take a long time to catch up with him. Take his comments from 1995, in which he described the children of single mothers as \u201cignorant, aggressive and illegitimate\u201d. We\u2019re still waiting for an apology for that one, after Johnson concluded that an election campaign \u201cisn\u2019t the time\u201d to discuss what he actually thinks of the electorate. Cue sighs of relief from his team. On that timeline, we should still be waiting for an apology over Johnson\u2019s Brexit pledges in 2043 \u2013 which, incidentally, is likely to coincide with the latest round of talks over Britain\u2019s EU trade deal. Gaffe of the campaign Kudos to Sinn F\u00e9in candidate John Finucane, who got a ticking off from police for urinating in the street, thereby handing us a useful metaphor for the election. But the win goes to the Lib Dems, who have proved that there is no opportunity so big that it cannot be, in the parlance of the prime minister, \u201cspaffed up the wall\u201d. Their pledge to revoke Brexit should they win a majority was so toxic on the doorstep that candidates have been busy reassuring voters that no one would be stupid enough to elect that many of them. Let\u2019s not forget that it was the Lib Dems who precipitated this election all those six weeks ago. A case of turkeys not only voting for Christmas, but offering to turn on the oven and spend the night soaking in a bath of sage and aromatics. Revelation of the campaign Huge news as some of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party MEPs quit over their party\u2019s strategy. The notion that Farage had a strategy was a shock.

      "body": "<p>The British electoral system is both cruel and crude. In a winner-takes-all, first-past-the-post setup, many votes are wasted, the main parties are overrepresented in the House of Commons and if people want to make a difference, they often have to ignore their first preference and vote tactically for their second. It\u2019s a third-rate system, but it\u2019s the one we have.</p> <p>Twenty two years ago, when I edited the <em>Observer</em>, we published polls in 20 key constituencies on the Sunday before the 1997 general election, urging voters to put aside their first preference and vote tactically for the most likely challenger to the incumbent Conservative party. Our work did make a difference, triggering the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/sep/12/conservatives.uk\" title=\"\">Michael Portillo moment</a>, for example, when one of the leading Eurosceptics lost his ultra-safe seat as Lib Dem voters set aside their first preference because of the evidence that Labour was the challenger.</p> <p>Today, the stakes are much higher. Again, the <em>Observer</em> is publishing a guide, compiled by the eminent pollster Peter Kellner, to which party lies second, this time in 50 seats; without tactical voting to create more Portillo moments, Britain will face another five years of Conservative government. We need tactical voting to have as great an impact on Thursday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/08/tactical-voting-guide-2019-keep-tories-out-remain-voter-general-election\">Tactical voting guide 2019: the 50 seats where it is vital to keep the Tories out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today\u2019s Tory party is not that of John Major or even David Cameron. To destroy Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, it has cynically and ruthlessly killed off its liberal wing. It has made a Faustian pact with a leader it knows to be callow and untrustworthy; Boris Johnson is Britain\u2019s version of Trump or Berlusconi. This Brexit party in all but name has deployed the Tory brand and widespread contempt for Jeremy Corbyn to consolidate the Leave vote while the Remain vote fractures. It has every prospect of winning a comfortable working majority \u2013 maybe to win big.</p> <p>In which case, relative economic decline and social distress are guaranteed to intensify while the bonds between governors and governed will become ever more toxically distrustful. Abroad, the country will become a leper on its own continent as it ruptures the benign trading, security and co-operative relationships built up with our neighbours over 46 years of EU membership, a rupture justified by lies, evasions and half-truths on an industrial scale that have so tragically polluted our public life. To oppose this, we only have days to marshal tactical voting power.</p> <p>The Labour party has suffered predictable derision for its economic plans and it made a strategic mistake in promising so much, so fast and so expensively through a new network of untried, top-down statist institutions, justifying some of the derision. But at least it is an attempted solution to Britain\u2019s problems of low growth, poor productivity and profound spatial, income and wealth inequalities \u2013 and it steps up to meet the climate crisis and environmental challenge head-on. Above all, Labour offers to reshape Brexit so there is a second referendum choice between a minimally economically damaging exit or none at all. There could be a way out of the conundrum that offers national resolution in a less self-destructive way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hopes that a US trade deal will offset the damage are moonshine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead, Johnson\u2019s Tory party promises to complete the rightwing coup that Brexit constitutes, along with deepening economic, social and cultural division. Johnson wants the break complete by the end of next year, an impossible timetable. But with a parliamentary majority, he can push through a no deal if it is not met.</p> <p>The best that could be hoped for if we leave the safe harbour of the EU\u2019s economic area is years of little economic growth as our businesses reel from broken supply chains, time-consuming customs checks, choked-off inward investment and only expensive access to our closest markets in Europe. Meanwhile, world markets become a wild west of growing trade protection as <a href=\"https://www.centreonconstitutionalchange.ac.uk/news-and-opinion/collapse-wto-court\" title=\"\">WTO rules collapse in the wake of the closure of its appellate court </a><a href=\"https://www.centreonconstitutionalchange.ac.uk/news-and-opinion/collapse-wto-court\" title=\"\">last week</a>. At worst, there will be an economic slump that will threaten the viability of our already rickety financial system.</p> <p>Hopes that a US trade deal will offset the damage are moonshine. Apart from how long it will take to negotiate, it involves necessarily working with a uniquely predatory capitalism along with its industrialised, inhuman agricultural sector \u2013 some steps away from the values Britain holds dear. The Tory manifesto is conspicuous for not going near any reset of capitalism so that it works more for social benefit; nor is there an industrial strategy. Britain is to trust in the magic of US-style rapacious business and cripplingly unfair labour markets, alleviated by the magic wand of infrastructure spending.</p> <p>This can only deliver low and unbalanced growth. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/23/why-is-life-expectancy-falling\" title=\"\">Life expectancy is declining</a> in the Brexit-voting parts of the north-west, north-east, Yorkshire, Humberside and East and West Midlands. As deindustrialisation accelerates with Brexit and without any agency to bring back economic life, the relative decline of these regions will accelerate, as will the fall-away in life expectancy. No determined effort to alleviate soul-destroying poverty, especially for an estimated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/16/new-study-finds-45-million-uk-children-living-in-poverty\" title=\"\">4.5 million children</a>, or to radically enhance skills and life chances is planned by the Tories. Instead, expect more of the same against the darkening background of Brexit.</p> <p>Yet the tribe will cement its hold on the state. Already, the prior qualification for any public appointment \u2013 from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/05/labour-criticises-tories-key-nhs-roles-going-party-peers\" title=\"\">chair of NHS England</a> to a trusteeship of the British Museum \u2013 is to have lent active support to the Tory party. It now wants to extend its grip to the upper echelons of the civil service and judiciary.</p> <p>Pressures will grow in Scotland and Northern Ireland to leave the union. Public service broadcasting will be diminished, with the BBC forced to retrench as it unfairly funds free TV licences for the over-75s. The attack dogs of the rightwing press will be offered ongoing permission to act as surrogates of government newspapers. Civic and political life will become a democratic charade.</p> <p>Only a hung parliament can save Britain from this fate. Labour, whatever it may say now, with fewer votes in the House of Commons than the Conservatives, will only be able to pass the most feasible and least contentious elements of its programme \u2013 but will deliver the vital second referendum on EU membership.</p> <p>The Tories may have made their Faustian pact with Johnson. There is no need for the country to do so too. Vote tactically this Thursday.</p> <p>\u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "The British electoral system is both cruel and crude. In a winner-takes-all, first-past-the-post setup, many votes are wasted, the main parties are overrepresented in the House of Commons and if people want to make a difference, they often have to ignore their first preference and vote tactically for their second. It\u2019s a third-rate system, but it\u2019s the one we have. Twenty two years ago, when I edited the Observer, we published polls in 20 key constituencies on the Sunday before the 1997 general election, urging voters to put aside their first preference and vote tactically for the most likely challenger to the incumbent Conservative party. Our work did make a difference, triggering the Michael Portillo moment, for example, when one of the leading Eurosceptics lost his ultra-safe seat as Lib Dem voters set aside their first preference because of the evidence that Labour was the challenger. Today, the stakes are much higher. Again, the Observer is publishing a guide, compiled by the eminent pollster Peter Kellner, to which party lies second, this time in 50 seats; without tactical voting to create more Portillo moments, Britain will face another five years of Conservative government. We need tactical voting to have as great an impact on Thursday. Today\u2019s Tory party is not that of John Major or even David Cameron. To destroy Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, it has cynically and ruthlessly killed off its liberal wing. It has made a Faustian pact with a leader it knows to be callow and untrustworthy; Boris Johnson is Britain\u2019s version of Trump or Berlusconi. This Brexit party in all but name has deployed the Tory brand and widespread contempt for Jeremy Corbyn to consolidate the Leave vote while the Remain vote fractures. It has every prospect of winning a comfortable working majority \u2013 maybe to win big. In which case, relative economic decline and social distress are guaranteed to intensify while the bonds between governors and governed will become ever more toxically distrustful. Abroad, the country will become a leper on its own continent as it ruptures the benign trading, security and co-operative relationships built up with our neighbours over 46 years of EU membership, a rupture justified by lies, evasions and half-truths on an industrial scale that have so tragically polluted our public life. To oppose this, we only have days to marshal tactical voting power. The Labour party has suffered predictable derision for its economic plans and it made a strategic mistake in promising so much, so fast and so expensively through a new network of untried, top-down statist institutions, justifying some of the derision. But at least it is an attempted solution to Britain\u2019s problems of low growth, poor productivity and profound spatial, income and wealth inequalities \u2013 and it steps up to meet the climate crisis and environmental challenge head-on. Above all, Labour offers to reshape Brexit so there is a second referendum choice between a minimally economically damaging exit or none at all. There could be a way out of the conundrum that offers national resolution in a less self-destructive way. Instead, Johnson\u2019s Tory party promises to complete the rightwing coup that Brexit constitutes, along with deepening economic, social and cultural division. Johnson wants the break complete by the end of next year, an impossible timetable. But with a parliamentary majority, he can push through a no deal if it is not met. The best that could be hoped for if we leave the safe harbour of the EU\u2019s economic area is years of little economic growth as our businesses reel from broken supply chains, time-consuming customs checks, choked-off inward investment and only expensive access to our closest markets in Europe. Meanwhile, world markets become a wild west of growing trade protection as WTO rules collapse in the wake of the closure of its appellate court last week. At worst, there will be an economic slump that will threaten the viability of our already rickety financial system. Hopes that a US trade deal will offset the damage are moonshine. Apart from how long it will take to negotiate, it involves necessarily working with a uniquely predatory capitalism along with its industrialised, inhuman agricultural sector \u2013 some steps away from the values Britain holds dear. The Tory manifesto is conspicuous for not going near any reset of capitalism so that it works more for social benefit; nor is there an industrial strategy. Britain is to trust in the magic of US-style rapacious business and cripplingly unfair labour markets, alleviated by the magic wand of infrastructure spending. This can only deliver low and unbalanced growth. Life expectancy is declining in the Brexit-voting parts of the north-west, north-east, Yorkshire, Humberside and East and West Midlands. As deindustrialisation accelerates with Brexit and without any agency to bring back economic life, the relative decline of these regions will accelerate, as will the fall-away in life expectancy. No determined effort to alleviate soul-destroying poverty, especially for an estimated 4.5 million children, or to radically enhance skills and life chances is planned by the Tories. Instead, expect more of the same against the darkening background of Brexit. Yet the tribe will cement its hold on the state. Already, the prior qualification for any public appointment \u2013 from the chair of NHS England to a trusteeship of the British Museum \u2013 is to have lent active support to the Tory party. It now wants to extend its grip to the upper echelons of the civil service and judiciary. Pressures will grow in Scotland and Northern Ireland to leave the union. Public service broadcasting will be diminished, with the BBC forced to retrench as it unfairly funds free TV licences for the over-75s. The attack dogs of the rightwing press will be offered ongoing permission to act as surrogates of government newspapers. Civic and political life will become a democratic charade. Only a hung parliament can save Britain from this fate. Labour, whatever it may say now, with fewer votes in the House of Commons than the Conservatives, will only be able to pass the most feasible and least contentious elements of its programme \u2013 but will deliver the vital second referendum on EU membership. The Tories may have made their Faustian pact with Johnson. There is no need for the country to do so too. Vote tactically this Thursday. \u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",

Such deals have been in existence for years but have ballooned in number recently, with consumers being offered initial interest-free periods before typically being charged high interest rates. Former pensions minister and debt campaigner Ros Altmann said cooling-off periods and more stringent affordability checks should be introduced before people took on new debts. Her call comes amid mounting concern about the number of credit options available to shoppers and fears that people are taking on so many different debts that they lose track of how much money they owe and when they have to repay it. Altmann said: \u201cThe rise of buy now, pay later retailing is of great concern, as more people are being enticed into high-cost debt that they may struggle to repay.

It\u2019s not a reference to the quality of drinking water (about which polemic abounds because it is so dirty) but to the beguiling lure of this dusty and dangerous yet strong and charismatic city. It\u2019s a dictum that might be applied to the whole 2,000-mile Mexico-US borderland of which Ju\u00e1rez and its sister city on the US side, El Paso, form the fulcrum.</p> <p>Ten years ago, I returned from several months\u2019 immersion along that frontier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/23/mexico-drug-wars-cartels\" title=\"\">reporting</a> on a narco-cartel war for this newspaper and eventually writing a book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/07/amexica-ed-vulliamy-review\" title=\"\">Amexica</a></em>, about the terrain astride the border, land that has a single identity \u2013 that belongs to both countries and yet to neither. A frontier at once porous and harsh: across which communities live and a million people traverse every day, legally, as do hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods annually.</p> <p>In the past 10 years I\u2019ve returned scores of times and even lived there for a while, but now the border crisis is so urgent \u2013 with regard to narco-traffic and migration \u2013 that I felt I needed to go back and revisit voices and themes, try to measure what has changed and what has not since I wrote the book. <em>Amexica </em>+ 10, if you like. This is now a frontier on which US president Donald Trump fixates, pledging a wall to run its length as a rampart against an \u201cinvasion\u201d. Thousands die or disappear trying to cross it, desperate migrants gather on its southern side, with dreams and illusions of America, only to be incarcerated, separated from family and deported when they get there.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In what is supposed to be peacetime, a new kind of war rages across this\u00a0enthralling country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What were lonely desert byways 10 years ago now host traffic jams of reporters and TV crews, as the border becomes a place of humanitarian disaster, main mast of Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.

Homicides then waned, only to spike again now: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/23/mexico-crime-homicides-violence-up-report\" title=\"\">last year was the bloodiest yet in Mexico</a>, and 2019 is set to overtake it, with the government last week counting <a href=\"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/homicide-numbers-up-only-slightly/\" title=\"\">29,574 reported homicides to the end of </a><a href=\"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/homicide-numbers-up-only-slightly/\" title=\"\">October</a>.</p> <p>Ten years ago, the task was to report how Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Sinaloa cartel supplanted rivals along the border west of Ju\u00e1rez, for export mainly of cocaine; then downriver, less successfully, confronting the Zetas and Gulf cartels in Coahuila and Tamaulipas. Now, with Guzm\u00e1n jailed and his cartel fragmented, the <em>plaza</em> \u2013 the drug traffic turf \u2013 is unquiet again, as the C\u00e1rtel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n stakes its claim, trafficking mainly in synthetic drugs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/04/fentanyl-drug-heroin-new-hampshire-mexico-cartels\" title=\"\">fentanyl</a> to fill a vacuum left by the clawback on prescribed opioids in the US. Violence increases when the plates shift, and while it used to be worst along the border, now \u2013 though Tijuana is Mexico\u2019s, and the world\u2019s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/26/migrants-violence-tijuana-murder-capital\" title=\"\">murder capital</a> \u2013 killing is across the country, through Jalisco, Colima, Guerrero and Veracruz in particular.</p> <p>What happens along this frontier is a prism through which to examine a world where the illicit economy bleeds into the supposedly legal one, to render the border between them a sieve like the physical border itself, as high street banks launder profits of drug traffic with impunity. <em>Amexica</em> ended with the story of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs\" title=\"\">Wachovia bank moving $37</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs\" title=\"\">8bn</a> from Mexico, much of it from the Sinaloa cartel, without adequate checks. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/hsbcholdings\" title=\"\">HSBC</a>, too, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/17/hsbc-executive-resigns-senate\" title=\"\">caught moving El Chapo\u2019s money</a>. No one from either bank has been arrested, let alone jailed.

I call it the lie of legality.</p> <p>And so, in what is supposed to be peacetime, a new kind of 21st-century war rages across this enthralling country. The official <a href=\"https://www.inegi.org.mx/sistemas/olap/consulta/general_ver4/MDXQueryDatos.asp?#Regreso&amp;c=\" title=\"\">number of homicides</a> in Mexico since 2007 \u2013 307,624, excluding the disappeared, until October this year \u2013 stands at a level akin to that in some of the worst wars in recent history, yet effervescent Ju\u00e1rez is not like, say, besieged Sarajevo. Part of my book\u2019s aim was to describe unspeakable violence in places where life goes on and daily encounters were generally a delight. This does not change: in no place I know are the ready smile, the unnecessary chat, the twinkle-in-the-eye so pervasive. Uber works fine, people go to mass and to market, shopping centres open, burritos and pastries are delicious, restaurants full again. \u201cIt looks normal,\u201d says Juli\u00e1n Cardona, who took the photographs in Ju\u00e1rez for this article, \u201cbut it\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>Cardona has coined the term \u201curban Frankenstein\u201d to describe his adoptive city. Last January, the bodies of a family running a grocery in Ju\u00e1rez were discovered only after stray dogs found and started eating them. In Tijuana, I reported on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/16/tijuana-migrant-child-murders-mexico-us-asylum\" title=\"\">the abduction and murder of two Honduran migrant boys</a> \u2013 Jasson Ricardo Acu\u00f1a and Jorge Alexander Ru\u00edz \u2013 and the testimony of a third, who survived and led police to the scene. Jos\u00e9 Alberto \u00c1lavarez, Tijuana\u2019s district attorney, showed me photographs of the victims, aged 16 and 17: \u201cI fear to note that one of the deceased was dressed in women\u2019s clothes,\u201d he says, showing a lifeless body, bloodied and strangled, wearing a brassiere and red skirt. \u201cNot only that, but when the survivor took us to the house, one of the killers was still wearing the clothes and shoes of the deceased. Two days later. That\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d</p> <h2>Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f9f3e5dd433d6b70bc2e0642515faa62056052d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f9f3e5dd433d6b70bc2e0642515faa62056052d/0_0_3000_2018/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pastor Jos\u00e9 Antonio Galvan with Yogi and other residents of the Visi\u00f3n En Acci\u00f3n centre in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pastor Jos\u00e9 Antonio Galvan with Yogi and other residents of the Visi\u00f3n En Acci\u00f3n centre in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Cardona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First stirrings precede first light in the Chihuahua desert, beyond the frayed edges of Ju\u00e1rez. Mumbling, moaning, crashing of pans heating coffee and the odd scream, at <a href=\"https://www.visioninactionrescueasylum.com/\" title=\"\">Visi\u00f3n En Acci\u00f3n</a> rehabilitation centre, or \u201crescue asylum\u201d. As the sun\u2019s fiery rays break over the scrub, residents emerge from their sleeping quarters around a courtyard, deranged but dutifully carrying soiled blankets to be bleached in the heat. Rafael heaves his pungent load, saying first that he was a missionary from Veracruz, but then again, he was a dealer from Ju\u00e1rez; actually, he\u2019s a millionaire from Zacatecas \u2013 he\u2019s not sure.</p> <p>This sanctuary for the abandoned mentally ill and other vulnerable people has been run for 24 years by pastor Jos\u00e9 Antonio Galv\u00e1n, who joked 10 years ago that the city out there \u2013 full of <em>yonkes</em>, junkyards of cars totalled in America, refitted for the road \u2013 was actually a \u201chuman junkyard\u201d, while this was \u201ca haven of peace\u201d. Which it is, in a way: where recovering addicts, penitent cartel sicarios (hitmen) and their mistresses, psychos, street dealers and those discarded by the city\u2019s assembly plant economy are refitted for life. Last time I was here, I spent a few nights sharing quarters with a man called Josu\u00e9, who told me he had been \u201cdead when I got here\u201d, from street-gang life in Los Angeles and heroin in Ju\u00e1rez. Today, all that remains of him here is his degree certificate, framed on the pastor\u2019s wall \u2013 Josu\u00e9 is now a practising nurse.</p> <p>Galv\u00e1n still looks like the teddy boy he once was \u2013 in a purple paisley jacket that seems, and doesn\u2019t seem, out of place here \u2013 and greets me with the poised fists of the boxer he also was. \u201cThe Lord is on my side,\u201d he says, punching the air. I feel 10 years older, I tell him, yet he seems younger. \u201cHave passion, have faith, have life,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThese are my people, under my wing. I feel part of this desert now, like a lizard \u2013 you\u2019ve got to look carefully, know what you\u2019re doing and move fast.\u201d Threats from cartels and gangs seeking out patients to enact vengeance have eased, he reports, but \u201cthey never go away\u201d.</p> <p>An estimated 40,000 people have disappeared since 2006 in Mexico \u2013 one of the most outrageous aspects of this war \u2013 and some are found by Peludo, the centre\u2019s pet dog. \u201cHe keeps finding legs, then a head, different bodies in different places, of people who have been kidnapped and disappeared in the desert,\u201d says Galv\u00e1n. \u201cSometimes when it rains, bodies surface, and come floating.\u201d</p> <p>In the yard, \u201chis people\u201d greet Galv\u00e1n, hugging his waist while he pats their matted hair, strokes their scars, each precious to him. Things change, and they don\u2019t. Becky, former pole dancer and crackhead, is dead now, as is big Oscar, former sicario for the Barrio Azteca gang, street affiliate of the old Ju\u00e1rez cartel. But Yogi is still here, shaven-headed 10 years ago, now sporting a jester\u2019s hat. He has Down\u2019s syndrome and schizophrenia.</p> <p>There\u2019s been impressive building work in recent years; what were timeworn breeze-blocks are now whitewashed walls; there\u2019s air conditioning, even a TV area for telenovelas and baseball.

Born to a middle-class family in Guanajuato, Vera had \u201centered a life of prostitution and pole dancing \u2013 pregnant at 15,\u201d she says. \u201cI attracted bad people: narcos, sicarios, <em>jefes</em>\u2026\u201d Before long, she was one of them, selling and moving drugs for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/10/mexico-drug-cartels-soldiers-military\" title=\"\">Knights Templar cartel</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI saw everything: murder, kidnappings. So much violence, so many drugs, so much sex, you don\u2019t see it for what it is. I admired the power of these people, and respected their authority.\u201d But such proximity was also dangerous, as the Knights were overrun by the Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n: \u201cThey kill women because they have so much information; the favoured women know everything.\u201d</p> <p>After a disastrous relationship, Vera attempted suicide, but was rescued by her parents and placed in a psychiatric hospital. Her parents sold their house to pay for treatment at a shelter and finally Vera arrived at Visi\u00f3n En Acci\u00f3n.</p> <p>\u201cVera has a keen sense for things,\u201d Galvan comments, \u201cand [while helping in the office] she spotted something wrong with the cheques. She suspected a man called Beto, who was my right-hand man. She was right \u2013 Beto was stealing from us. He quit and I gave Vera the job. \u201cYou see,\u201d he adds, \u201cmy job is to find the treasure in people they don\u2019t even know is there themselves.\u201d</p> <p>That must have been difficult in the case of Neor (not his real name), host for my overnight stay. He had had a \u201cbad life\u201d with his father \u201ctaking drugs, whipping us all \u2013 no money, no food\u201d. Neor started on crystal, crack and solvents at the age of 12, then started \u201crobbing and killing for money\u201d, and inevitably did so for a major cartel. \u201cI was a sicario,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cOnce you\u2019ve killed the first time, it gets easy \u2013 I was taking so much crystal, I could handle it.\u201d</p> <p>Then one day the time came for him to kill a man who had been given the task of selling a large amount of meth, but had kept and spent the money. \u201cIt was a big hit. For some reason I didn\u2019t want to do it, but they said if I didn\u2019t, they\u2019d kill me.\u201d After a shootout at his house \u2013 \u201cI took a bullet in the leg\u201d, Neor shows me the scar \u2013 he escaped and went on the run. He had heard about a former drug dealer now working at Visi\u00f3n En Acci\u00f3n, and was brought here. How long ago?

A torch is applied, flame spreads across the hillock of drugs, black smoke billows skywards \u2013 and a platoon of agents from the Agencia de Investigaci\u00f3n Criminal line up for a team photo against the backdrop of the inferno.

Last year, a report by the Citizens\u2019 Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice, which measures homicides per capita, found six of the world\u2019s 10 most murderous cities to be in Mexico, and Tijuana top of the list.</p> <p>The epilogue to my book was an interview with Antonio Ir\u00e1n \u201cHiram\u201d Mu\u00f1oz, whose macabre expertise at the prosecutor\u2019s office was to analyse the mutilations of cartel victims to decode any messages they might contain \u2013 he called it \u201cnecropsia\u201d rather than \u201cautopsia\u201d: severed feet or toes if someone walked from a cartel, the sliced tongue of a snitch. A forensic expert, but also a philosopher, Mu\u00f1oz was furious at how few prosecutions resulted from his work.</p> <p>We meet now at the Ateneo de Ciencias Universitarias y Artes. Mu\u00f1oz himself founded this college \u201cto train young people to blend the \u2018criminalistic\u2019 \u2013 what is found at a crime scene, scientifically \u2013 and the \u2018criminological\u2019, which is psychological, why the criminal did what he did\u201d, he says. \u201cTen years ago, we talked about terrible things happening in this city.

That still happens in the south, but no longer here. In Tijuana now, they just shoot each other on street corners like dogs. Now you just find bodies \u2013 usually killed in one place, and dumped in another.\u201d Before, he posits, \u201cthe narco only killed who he needed to kill. Now, anyone can be a narco \u2013 and they kill anyone.\u201d</p> <p>This change has come about because Mexico\u2019s domestic drug market \u2013 the so-called <em>narcomenudeo</em> \u2013 has increased further since <em>Amexica</em> and is now believed to account for even more violence than that caused by competition for \u201cexport\u201d <em>plazas</em>. \u201cThe drugs don\u2019t just fly to the north,\u201d says Mu\u00f1oz, \u201cthey also stay here, so that now there\u2019s a war for the streets here \u2013 and this contributes to the general collapse. There is no message to send now: I just erase you from the point of sale. Kill one, and I have four more waiting to replace you.\u201d</p> <p>Mu\u00f1oz notes the arrival of fentanyl on the domestic and export markets: \u201cIt\u2019s cheap to make and easy to smuggle. I also come across it in my forensic investigations \u2013 more deaths from fentanyl, often mixed with cocaine, without the addict knowing. Dealers cut other drugs with fentanyl to make them even more addictive.</p> <p>\u201cHuman beings are addicts, addicts of pleasure and power \u2013 coffee, alcohol, sex, extreme sports \u2013 and drugs are the most addictive of all. It\u2019s never going to go away, and what makes this war pure stupidity is that we are never going to win it unless we see the addict as a sick person, not a criminal.\u201d</p> <h2>Brownsville/Matamoros, Rio Grande valley</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1398b042b7c14d0aaa20ceaf1e6a2d34a368c421\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1398b042b7c14d0aaa20ceaf1e6a2d34a368c421/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Migrants from Guatemala cross the Rio Bravo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Migrants from Guatemala cross the Rio Bravo (as the Rio Grande is known in Mexico) to request asylum in El Paso, Texas.

A decade ago, Michael Seifert had recently left the priesthood at his parish of San Felipe de Jes\u00fas in Cameron Park, Brownsville, fallen in love with a paediatrician and married her. But he continued to work for the community in a post-pastoral role, until this poorest, entirely Hispanic, quarter of town became the last to be \u201cincorporated\u201d, with running water and electricity in almost every home. Still devout, but a radical theologian, Seifert posited 10 years ago that the Virgin of Guadalupe portrays a dancing Madonna, pregnant with the <em>mestizo</em> Mexican race \u2013 mixed because it was the product of rape by Spanish conquistadors. We meet again: \u201cI had Mexican seminarians walk out on me for that,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cShe\u2019s supposed to be immaculate.\u201d</p> <p>Seifert remains \u201cplugged in to Cameron Park, all the better to keep people connected\u201d, but has adapted his work to the migration crisis, for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), with an \u201cintegrated advocacy\u201d team guiding migrants as they cross from Matamoros into Brownsville in the US, and writing regular internet reports entitled <a href=\"https://alongsideaborder.com/\" title=\"\">Views </a><a href=\"https://alongsideaborder.com/\" title=\"\">from Alongside a Border</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThese people came here,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause they wanted to be safe. Yet over in Matamoros, they are prey to deadly criminals, and here they are met with a system carefully designed to fail them.

The Mexican government of leftwing president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has given full support, earning compliments from Trump for \u201cspectacular\u201d results: some 58,000 asylum seekers are now reported returned to, and waiting in, Mexico.</p> <p>Immigration courts on the US side are perfunctory and dysfunctional. I was forbidden entry to the huge tent \u2013 or \u201csoft-sided facility\u201d as the government calls it \u2013 erected on the Brownsville side of the river to hear pleas by video link. But I did visit two courts dealing with detained migrants at nearby McAllen and Port Isabel: rows of shackled, confused, weary people hustled through production-line \u201cjustice\u201d, with, in some cases, no more exchange with the bench than a nod to indicate understanding of their \u201crights\u201d, before deportation.</p> <p>Beside the Gateway bridge connecting Matamoros to downtown Brownsville, across a few yards of river and reed bank, is a tent city of around 1,000 people, encamped for safety in numbers, mostly \u201cwaiting in Mexico\u201d for the date on their crumpled but clasped Notice to Appear given to them before they were sent back under Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy. A higher proportion are returned to Matamoros than anywhere else on the border, for all the dangers.</p> <p>My book <em>Amexica</em> ended with the story of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/25/mexico-massacre-central-american-migrants\" title=\"\">massacre of 72 migrants at San Fernando</a>, Tamaulipas, in 2010. Migrant massacres and disappearances have become increasingly common. On Christmas Eve 2011, 15 migrants were dragged from a diocesan shelter in Matamoros, and never seen again; scores of disappearances have followed. Staff at the bus station have witnessed, on many occasions, the macabre arrival of baggage belonging to migrants on board coaches from the interior, with no one to claim them. In Nuevo Laredo last month, Aar\u00f3n M\u00e9ndez, manager of a Presbyterian shelter, was abducted after refusing to hand over those in his care to a unit of gunmen. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"993fa0b2d6bf5336cf60b478648367eb8acfd5ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/993fa0b2d6bf5336cf60b478648367eb8acfd5ec/0_105_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glady Ca\u00f1as Aguilar, advocate for refugees, waiting in Matamoros to cross to the US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glady Ca\u00f1as Aguilar, advocate for refugees, waiting in Matamoros to cross to the US in October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo by Ed Vulliamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seifert had put me in touch with his opposite number on the Matamoros side of the border, the kind of person these situations throw up, hurricane heroines and heroes of the hour. Glady Ca\u00f1as Aguilar is in her \u201coffice\u201d in a small row of shops. A crowd awaits her; everyone wants a piece of her \u2013 a moment with her. About 80% of migrants, she says, come from Honduras, fleeing gang violence \u2013 also from El Salvador, Guatemala, Cuba, and some from Africa. \u201cPeople often stay for months,\u201d she says, crossing in groups of 15 according to a system operated by the border patrol known as \u201cmetering\u201d, which limits the number of people who may apply, creating numbered waiting lists on the Mexican side. \u201cMore than 250 tents and we cope,\u201d she says, \u201cjust about, but they\u2019ve been here too long and it\u2019s all too much \u2013 chicken pox, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and waiting, waiting\u2026 Here, they\u2019re safe, but out in the town, absolutely not.\u201d Ca\u00f1as Aguilar blames a \u201cfalta de amor\u201d \u2013 lack of love \u2013 in the world. But she must go now: a group of Tzotzil Mayans has arrived from the Mexican town of San Juan Chamula, evicted by fighting between rival political militias; she takes control of the chaotic scene, distributing sanitary kit and clothes \u2013 including a silver-sequined tunic for a girl called Flora.</p> <h2>Back to Ju\u00e1rez</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8c0193dd14a80403560964fcb8b72bbcb61efb07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c0193dd14a80403560964fcb8b72bbcb61efb07/0_310_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.

Armando Rodr\u00edguez was shot dead in his car as he prepared to take his daughter to school in November 2008. Sandra Rodr\u00edguez took the same risks, wrote the same kind of stories for which her friend died. She was preoccupied by what she called \u201cthe culture of impunity in this city, from its very design, to the way the economy works; from the street to the top\u201d. She published an important book of reportage from the city in 2012, <em>La F\u00e1brica del Crimen</em> (The Crime Factory), which was published in English as <em><a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2473-the-story-of-vicente-who-murdered-his-mother-his-father-and-his-sister\" title=\"\">The Story of Vicente, Who Murdered His Mother, His Father and His Sister</a></em>, which he did.</p> <p>Rather than write about capos and sicarios, Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s subject is the brutalisation of Mexican society. Vicente did what he did, he said, <em>\u201cporque puedo\u201d</em>, because I can.</p> <p>Over the past decade, Rodr\u00edguez reflects, \u201cthe story of Mexico is as Vicente predicted: you can do whatever you want, with impunity. You can kill whoever you want, kill in broad daylight, kill a journalist, disappear 43 students \u2013 and get away with it. Vicente has become a metaphor for the whole country.\u201d</p> <p>As news editor, Rodr\u00edguez faces a dilemma. \u201cWe have a picture,\u201d she says, \u201cof two people walking past a corpse, and they don\u2019t even glance at it \u2013 this is Ju\u00e1rez after 10 years. I want it on the front page, but we don\u2019t have a story to go with it. Or we have a 16-year-old killed, without a birth certificate or school record. Again, this should be front-page news. But it\u2019s not: people being killed is no longer news in Ju\u00e1rez, or the rest of Mexico \u2013 killing has become normal and crime has become a habit.\u201d</p> <p>Rodr\u00edguez has since lost another colleague, Miroslava Breach, an investigative journalist from her home town of Chiuhuahua, murdered in 2017 when leaving home, like Armando. Twelve journalists have been killed in Mexico so far this year, so that \u2013 according to a report on US National Public Radio last month, Mexico has overtaken Syria as the most dangerous country in the world for journalists. On the day I crossed from El Paso to Ju\u00e1rez this time, a correspondent from <em>National Geographic</em> was shot and wounded.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d says Rodr\u00edguez. \u201cIt comes from the same disease, impunity. They do it because they know they can, to silence the press.\u201d And yet, for all this, when a friend in our company asks: \u201cHave you ever been really happy?\u201d Rodr\u00edguez does not hesitate: \u201cYes, my city makes me happy. I love Ju\u00e1rez; it kills people, but it gives me a sense of life, unconnected to the killings, to do with its complexity, and its people.\u201d</p> <p>Kill it certainly does. The culture of impunity, says Rodr\u00edguez, has its roots in the 90s, \u201cwith the killing of 300 women in this city, when we realised nothing would happen to the killers\u201d. The so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/14/mexico-murders-women-rise-sharply-drug-war-intensifies\" title=\"\">\u201cFemicidio\u201d</a> brought Ju\u00e1rez to the attention of the world, and me back to the city in 1999. The misogynist \u201cstyle\u201d of killing \u2013 a word used \u201cnot lightly\u201d by anthropologist Cecilia Ball\u00ed in <em>Amexica</em> \u2013 seemed to take the violence to another level.

My chapter on the Femicidio opened with Paula imploring the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which Sagrario wore around her neck: \u201cWhere were you when they did this to my little girl?\u201d</p> <p>Flores\u2019s face has changed remarkably little since I last saw her 10 years ago, or indeed since I first interviewed her in 1999 and again in 2002. It carries that same wounded but indomitable fortitude. She lives in the same house, attached to the family\u2019s grocery store at the top of the Anapra barrio, a quarter called Lomas de Poleo, on the north-western outskirts of town, right against the border. An old, repainted American school bus grinds up the dusty slope, with the mountains behind El Paso as backdrop.</p> <p>\u201cTime passes,\u201d Flores says. \u201cIt\u2019s been 21 years now and everything is the same \u2013 nothing has happened. We are marked for life, and will remain so while there is no reckoning with what happened. There can be no recovery. And it continues: women keep disappearing, keep being murdered.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, \u201cI have my store, and my family. At weekends we are all together, all from Durango, though my grandchildren were born here. Eleven of them now, some of the age Maria Sagrario was, and that can be traumatic.\u201d</p> <p>In 2005, a man called Jos\u00e9 Luis Hern\u00e1ndez was jailed for the murder of Maria Sagrario \u2013 sentenced for 28 years. \u201cBut I fear he will be out much sooner,\u201d says Flores. That is not the end of the matter: \u201cHe said he was paid $800 to be part of this. But by whom? Who else was involved, and why? We have always said that everything rests with the authorities, that the authorities were complicit in the murder of women in Ju\u00e1rez.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"014cd0801f7ee28e95beb6fd3a8695bda757d9bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/014cd0801f7ee28e95beb6fd3a8695bda757d9bd/0_0_4500_3027/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paula Flores\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We are marked for life\u2019: Paula Flores, whose daughter Mar\u00eda Sagrario, was murdered in 1998, photographed earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Cardona/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEvery year, on the anniversary \u2013 16 April \u2013 we get together and repaint the crosses,\u201d says Flores \u2013 they are black on a pink background, painted or placed on walls, lamp-posts and public spaces around the city. In 2012, the mayor of Ju\u00e1rez, Hector Murgu\u00eda, announced he would ban this practice and \u201capply the law\u201d on defacement of public space. \u201cHe threatened us, but we did it,\u201d says Flores, though \u201cthis year only four of us turned up.\u201d</p> <p>The mothers of six murdered women, including Flores, filed a suit \u2013 Silvia Elena Rivera Morales et al vs Mexico \u2013 through the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, over the authorities\u2019 abrogation of responsibility. A hearing was held in Washington DC on 29 September. \u201cThough my daughter\u2019s case is from 21 years ago,\u201d Flores told the commission, \u201cI still feel the same pain of my daughter not being here. She deserves justice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says now in her kitchen, \u201cwith the other mothers, we\u2019re still pushing this. It was all very nice there in Washington, and the president of the court offered his sympathies. But they\u2019ve had this case since 2007, and it\u2019s a verdict we need, not sympathy. I don\u2019t think they have any idea of the emotional toll, the pain involved.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/07/amexica-ed-vulliamy-review\">Amexica: War Along  the Borderline by Ed Vulliamy \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Flores seems rightly exhausted with trying to find words for the unspeakable. Two of her other daughters arrive, and there\u2019s a delicious lunch of spicy beans, cheese and tortillas, a portrait of Maria Sagrario staring down from the back wall. There\u2019s discussion of music, grandchildren, climate crisis and life around the barrio. We\u2019re done for today with what Edgar Allan Poe called \u201cthe hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed\u201d.</p> <p>But there\u2019s one final question: where was the Virgin of Guadalupe when they did that? \u201cI asked the same question to the cross on her coffin, and the virgin on her locket: why didn\u2019t she protect her?\u201d says Flores, \u201cand I\u2019ve asked it every day since, and I hear no answer. I still believe. But how can it be? Maria Sagrario was not against God; she was a believer, she sang in church, and helped at Sunday school. During Lent that year, I prayed for the protection of my daughters. Three days later, Maria Sagrario disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cI try to ask myself not so much \u2018Why did she die?\u2019 but \u2018For what?\u2019 Maybe for the school. Maybe so that with the help of the other mothers, I can raise awareness about what is happening here.

      "bodyText": "If you drink the water in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, there you\u2019ll stay, goes the saying \u2013 Se toma agua de Ju\u00e1rez, all\u00ed se queda. It\u2019s not a reference to the quality of drinking water (about which polemic abounds because it is so dirty) but to the beguiling lure of this dusty and dangerous yet strong and charismatic city. It\u2019s a dictum that might be applied to the whole 2,000-mile Mexico-US borderland of which Ju\u00e1rez and its sister city on the US side, El Paso, form the fulcrum. Ten years ago, I returned from several months\u2019 immersion along that frontier, reporting on a narco-cartel war for this newspaper and eventually writing a book, Amexica, about the terrain astride the border, land that has a single identity \u2013 that belongs to both countries and yet to neither. A frontier at once porous and harsh: across which communities live and a million people traverse every day, legally, as do hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods annually. In the past 10 years I\u2019ve returned scores of times and even lived there for a while, but now the border crisis is so urgent \u2013 with regard to narco-traffic and migration \u2013 that I felt I needed to go back and revisit voices and themes, try to measure what has changed and what has not since I wrote the book. Amexica + 10, if you like. This is now a frontier on which US president Donald Trump fixates, pledging a wall to run its length as a rampart against an \u201cinvasion\u201d. Thousands die or disappear trying to cross it, desperate migrants gather on its southern side, with dreams and illusions of America, only to be incarcerated, separated from family and deported when they get there. What were lonely desert byways 10 years ago now host traffic jams of reporters and TV crews, as the border becomes a place of humanitarian disaster, main mast of Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. Back then, you had to explain who and what Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n and his Sinaloa cartel were. Since that time, we\u2019ve had TV series Narcos ad nauseam, the films Sicario 1 and 2, some wonderful journalism and El Chapo\u2019s trial-as-theatre in New York. Ten years ago, the story along the borderline was narco-traffic, to which the theme of migration played an accompanying role, as the cartels moved in on human trafficking. Now the world is on the move, and much of it has converged on \u201cAmexica\u201d. While 10 years ago, most migrants at the border were in flight from violence and poverty in Mexico, now thousands flee gangland violence in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras; in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, a \u201clittle Havana\u201d of waiting Cubans is established; they come from eastern Europe and Asia; Haitians arrive in Tijuana; migrants gather in Ciudad Acu\u00f1a from the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa. A decade ago, the administration of Barack Obama began a clampdown on criminal immigrants, and accelerated deportations to record levels. Now, Trump has shocked his own country, collided with federal courts and outraged the world with policies separating children from parents, appalling conditions of incarceration, wholesale roundups of immigrants without papers \u2013 or criminal records \u2013 and the sending back ofasylum seekers to \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d (rather than wait for their initial hearings in the country where asylum has been claimed as per international law). But drug violence, cartels and their conviviality with government are perennial and ubiquitous. Amexica was published after the government of Felipe Calder\u00f3n declared war on the cartels in late 2006, after which murder rates hit the highest since the Mexican revolution, and Ju\u00e1rez was the most dangerous city in the world. Homicides then waned, only to spike again now: last year was the bloodiest yet in Mexico, and 2019 is set to overtake it, with the government last week counting 29,574 reported homicides to the end of October. Ten years ago, the task was to report how Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Sinaloa cartel supplanted rivals along the border west of Ju\u00e1rez, for export mainly of cocaine; then downriver, less successfully, confronting the Zetas and Gulf cartels in Coahuila and Tamaulipas. Now, with Guzm\u00e1n jailed and his cartel fragmented, the plaza \u2013 the drug traffic turf \u2013 is unquiet again, as the C\u00e1rtel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n stakes its claim, trafficking mainly in synthetic drugs and fentanyl to fill a vacuum left by the clawback on prescribed opioids in the US. Violence increases when the plates shift, and while it used to be worst along the border, now \u2013 though Tijuana is Mexico\u2019s, and the world\u2019s, murder capital \u2013 killing is across the country, through Jalisco, Colima, Guerrero and Veracruz in particular. What happens along this frontier is a prism through which to examine a world where the illicit economy bleeds into the supposedly legal one, to render the border between them a sieve like the physical border itself, as high street banks launder profits of drug traffic with impunity. Amexica ended with the story of the Wachovia bank moving $378bn from Mexico, much of it from the Sinaloa cartel, without adequate checks. HSBC, too, was caught moving El Chapo\u2019s money. No one from either bank has been arrested, let alone jailed. Following Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s conviction, US government forfeiture of his alleged $14bn value is all \u201cback in Mexico\u201d \u2013 money sent to be laundered south of the border \u2013 the small change; none of the hundreds of billions sent into the \u201clegal\u201d economy by Wachovia or HSBC are in their sights. I call it the lie of legality. And so, in what is supposed to be peacetime, a new kind of 21st-century war rages across this enthralling country. The official number of homicides in Mexico since 2007 \u2013 307,624, excluding the disappeared, until October this year \u2013 stands at a level akin to that in some of the worst wars in recent history, yet effervescent Ju\u00e1rez is not like, say, besieged Sarajevo. Part of my book\u2019s aim was to describe unspeakable violence in places where life goes on and daily encounters were generally a delight. This does not change: in no place I know are the ready smile, the unnecessary chat, the twinkle-in-the-eye so pervasive. Uber works fine, people go to mass and to market, shopping centres open, burritos and pastries are delicious, restaurants full again. \u201cIt looks normal,\u201d says Juli\u00e1n Cardona, who took the photographs in Ju\u00e1rez for this article, \u201cbut it\u2019s not.\u201d Cardona has coined the term \u201curban Frankenstein\u201d to describe his adoptive city. Last January, the bodies of a family running a grocery in Ju\u00e1rez were discovered only after stray dogs found and started eating them. In Tijuana, I reported on the abduction and murder of two Honduran migrant boys \u2013 Jasson Ricardo Acu\u00f1a and Jorge Alexander Ru\u00edz \u2013 and the testimony of a third, who survived and led police to the scene. Jos\u00e9 Alberto \u00c1lavarez, Tijuana\u2019s district attorney, showed me photographs of the victims, aged 16 and 17: \u201cI fear to note that one of the deceased was dressed in women\u2019s clothes,\u201d he says, showing a lifeless body, bloodied and strangled, wearing a brassiere and red skirt. \u201cNot only that, but when the survivor took us to the house, one of the killers was still wearing the clothes and shoes of the deceased. Two days later. That\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez First stirrings precede first light in the Chihuahua desert, beyond the frayed edges of Ju\u00e1rez. Mumbling, moaning, crashing of pans heating coffee and the odd scream, at Visi\u00f3n En Acci\u00f3n rehabilitation centre, or \u201crescue asylum\u201d. As the sun\u2019s fiery rays break over the scrub, residents emerge from their sleeping quarters around a courtyard, deranged but dutifully carrying soiled blankets to be bleached in the heat. Rafael heaves his pungent load, saying first that he was a missionary from Veracruz, but then again, he was a dealer from Ju\u00e1rez; actually, he\u2019s a millionaire from Zacatecas \u2013 he\u2019s not sure. This sanctuary for the abandoned mentally ill and other vulnerable people has been run for 24 years by pastor Jos\u00e9 Antonio Galv\u00e1n, who joked 10 years ago that the city out there \u2013 full of yonkes, junkyards of cars totalled in America, refitted for the road \u2013 was actually a \u201chuman junkyard\u201d, while this was \u201ca haven of peace\u201d. Which it is, in a way: where recovering addicts, penitent cartel sicarios (hitmen) and their mistresses, psychos, street dealers and those discarded by the city\u2019s assembly plant economy are refitted for life. Last time I was here, I spent a few nights sharing quarters with a man called Josu\u00e9, who told me he had been \u201cdead when I got here\u201d, from street-gang life in Los Angeles and heroin in Ju\u00e1rez. Today, all that remains of him here is his degree certificate, framed on the pastor\u2019s wall \u2013 Josu\u00e9 is now a practising nurse. Galv\u00e1n still looks like the teddy boy he once was \u2013 in a purple paisley jacket that seems, and doesn\u2019t seem, out of place here \u2013 and greets me with the poised fists of the boxer he also was. \u201cThe Lord is on my side,\u201d he says, punching the air. I feel 10 years older, I tell him, yet he seems younger. \u201cHave passion, have faith, have life,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThese are my people, under my wing. I feel part of this desert now, like a lizard \u2013 you\u2019ve got to look carefully, know what you\u2019re doing and move fast.\u201d Threats from cartels and gangs seeking out patients to enact vengeance have eased, he reports, but \u201cthey never go away\u201d. An estimated 40,000 people have disappeared since 2006 in Mexico \u2013 one of the most outrageous aspects of this war \u2013 and some are found by Peludo, the centre\u2019s pet dog. \u201cHe keeps finding legs, then a head, different bodies in different places, of people who have been kidnapped and disappeared in the desert,\u201d says Galv\u00e1n. \u201cSometimes when it rains, bodies surface, and come floating.\u201d In the yard, \u201chis people\u201d greet Galv\u00e1n, hugging his waist while he pats their matted hair, strokes their scars, each precious to him. Things change, and they don\u2019t. Becky, former pole dancer and crackhead, is dead now, as is big Oscar, former sicario for the Barrio Azteca gang, street affiliate of the old Ju\u00e1rez cartel. But Yogi is still here, shaven-headed 10 years ago, now sporting a jester\u2019s hat. He has Down\u2019s syndrome and schizophrenia. There\u2019s been impressive building work in recent years; what were timeworn breeze-blocks are now whitewashed walls; there\u2019s air conditioning, even a TV area for telenovelas and baseball. Across the patio, the mazed eyes, mind-sickness, and poignant affection between Galv\u00e1n and what he calls \u201cmy family\u201d, echo down 10 years on different faces. The drugs, too, are different, says Galv\u00e1n \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re seeing less crack, more crystal meth, and synthetics\u201d \u2013 but their ravages are the same. The shelter\u2019s nurse, Imelda Castro, explains that it takes \u201ca balance between miracles and medication\u201d. The place is staffed, as it always has been, by former patients, and Galv\u00e1n feels that the story of his last decade can best be told through their example; they are disarmingly open about where they\u2019ve come from. When Vera, the accountant at the centre, arrived four years ago, she was \u201ccompletely wild\u201d, says Galv\u00e1n. Born to a middle-class family in Guanajuato, Vera had \u201centered a life of prostitution and pole dancing \u2013 pregnant at 15,\u201d she says. \u201cI attracted bad people: narcos, sicarios, jefes\u2026\u201d Before long, she was one of them, selling and moving drugs for the Knights Templar cartel. \u201cI saw everything: murder, kidnappings. So much violence, so many drugs, so much sex, you don\u2019t see it for what it is. I admired the power of these people, and respected their authority.\u201d But such proximity was also dangerous, as the Knights were overrun by the Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n: \u201cThey kill women because they have so much information; the favoured women know everything.\u201d After a disastrous relationship, Vera attempted suicide, but was rescued by her parents and placed in a psychiatric hospital. Her parents sold their house to pay for treatment at a shelter and finally Vera arrived at Visi\u00f3n En Acci\u00f3n. \u201cVera has a keen sense for things,\u201d Galvan comments, \u201cand [while helping in the office] she spotted something wrong with the cheques. She suspected a man called Beto, who was my right-hand man. She was right \u2013 Beto was stealing from us. He quit and I gave Vera the job. \u201cYou see,\u201d he adds, \u201cmy job is to find the treasure in people they don\u2019t even know is there themselves.\u201d That must have been difficult in the case of Neor (not his real name), host for my overnight stay. He had had a \u201cbad life\u201d with his father \u201ctaking drugs, whipping us all \u2013 no money, no food\u201d. Neor started on crystal, crack and solvents at the age of 12, then started \u201crobbing and killing for money\u201d, and inevitably did so for a major cartel. \u201cI was a sicario,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve killed the first time, it gets easy \u2013 I was taking so much crystal, I could handle it.\u201d Then one day the time came for him to kill a man who had been given the task of selling a large amount of meth, but had kept and spent the money. \u201cIt was a big hit. For some reason I didn\u2019t want to do it, but they said if I didn\u2019t, they\u2019d kill me.\u201d After a shootout at his house \u2013 \u201cI took a bullet in the leg\u201d, Neor shows me the scar \u2013 he escaped and went on the run. He had heard about a former drug dealer now working at Visi\u00f3n En Acci\u00f3n, and was brought here. How long ago? He beams: \u201cFour months ago.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m strict,\u201d says Galv\u00e1n, \u201cafraid of nothing.\u201d One recent morning, though, Neor found himself out on the highway, planning to return to Guanajuato. \u201cI started shaking,\u201d he says, \u201cand a voice in me said: \u2018Don\u2019t. Go back to work\u2019.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a devil waiting to lure them back any time,\u201d says Galv\u00e1n, \u201cand I gotta beat that devil up.\u201d I had for a moment forgotten that the pastor himself was once an addict on the street. \u201cI learned that,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen I was living among the trash cans \u2013 when I was one of them.\u201d Tijuana On a rainy September morning in Tijuana, at the border\u2019s western edge, an ostentatious but imposing ceremony was arranged: an incineraci\u00f3n de droga by combined law enforcement agencies, where they set fire to 26,000 kilos of heroin, cocaine, crystal meth and other drugs. A torch is applied, flame spreads across the hillock of drugs, black smoke billows skywards \u2013 and a platoon of agents from the Agencia de Investigaci\u00f3n Criminal line up for a team photo against the backdrop of the inferno. It\u2019s been a while since this was done publicly here, but everyone knows it won\u2019t be the last time, and that \u2013 gallant though the choreography is \u2013 this pyre represents but a grain among millions, on the move, out there. My journey through Amexica 10 years ago began and ended here when Tijuana was second only to Ju\u00e1rez in its murder rate. Last year, a report by the Citizens\u2019 Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice, which measures homicides per capita, found six of the world\u2019s 10 most murderous cities to be in Mexico, and Tijuana top of the list. The epilogue to my book was an interview with Antonio Ir\u00e1n \u201cHiram\u201d Mu\u00f1oz, whose macabre expertise at the prosecutor\u2019s office was to analyse the mutilations of cartel victims to decode any messages they might contain \u2013 he called it \u201cnecropsia\u201d rather than \u201cautopsia\u201d: severed feet or toes if someone walked from a cartel, the sliced tongue of a snitch. A forensic expert, but also a philosopher, Mu\u00f1oz was furious at how few prosecutions resulted from his work. We meet now at the Ateneo de Ciencias Universitarias y Artes. Mu\u00f1oz himself founded this college \u201cto train young people to blend the \u2018criminalistic\u2019 \u2013 what is found at a crime scene, scientifically \u2013 and the \u2018criminological\u2019, which is psychological, why the criminal did what he did\u201d, he says. \u201cTen years ago, we talked about terrible things happening in this city. But I was failing to change things at the prosecutor\u2019s office, so decided to create my own university and impart what I knew to the next generation. \u201c[Back then] mutilations were a controlled way of communicating messages. That still happens in the south, but no longer here. In Tijuana now, they just shoot each other on street corners like dogs. Now you just find bodies \u2013 usually killed in one place, and dumped in another.\u201d Before, he posits, \u201cthe narco only killed who he needed to kill. Now, anyone can be a narco \u2013 and they kill anyone.\u201d This change has come about because Mexico\u2019s domestic drug market \u2013 the so-called narcomenudeo \u2013 has increased further since Amexica and is now believed to account for even more violence than that caused by competition for \u201cexport\u201d plazas. \u201cThe drugs don\u2019t just fly to the north,\u201d says Mu\u00f1oz, \u201cthey also stay here, so that now there\u2019s a war for the streets here \u2013 and this contributes to the general collapse. There is no message to send now: I just erase you from the point of sale. Kill one, and I have four more waiting to replace you.\u201d Mu\u00f1oz notes the arrival of fentanyl on the domestic and export markets: \u201cIt\u2019s cheap to make and easy to smuggle. I also come across it in my forensic investigations \u2013 more deaths from fentanyl, often mixed with cocaine, without the addict knowing. Dealers cut other drugs with fentanyl to make them even more addictive. \u201cHuman beings are addicts, addicts of pleasure and power \u2013 coffee, alcohol, sex, extreme sports \u2013 and drugs are the most addictive of all. It\u2019s never going to go away, and what makes this war pure stupidity is that we are never going to win it unless we see the addict as a sick person, not a criminal.\u201d Brownsville/Matamoros, Rio Grande valley The road bends, along stretches of new fence, to the river\u2019s end, where the twin towns of Brownsville and Matamoros, one of six bi-national metropolitan border areas, face one another. A decade ago, Michael Seifert had recently left the priesthood at his parish of San Felipe de Jes\u00fas in Cameron Park, Brownsville, fallen in love with a paediatrician and married her. But he continued to work for the community in a post-pastoral role, until this poorest, entirely Hispanic, quarter of town became the last to be \u201cincorporated\u201d, with running water and electricity in almost every home. Still devout, but a radical theologian, Seifert posited 10 years ago that the Virgin of Guadalupe portrays a dancing Madonna, pregnant with the mestizo Mexican race \u2013 mixed because it was the product of rape by Spanish conquistadors. We meet again: \u201cI had Mexican seminarians walk out on me for that,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cShe\u2019s supposed to be immaculate.\u201d Seifert remains \u201cplugged in to Cameron Park, all the better to keep people connected\u201d, but has adapted his work to the migration crisis, for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), with an \u201cintegrated advocacy\u201d team guiding migrants as they cross from Matamoros into Brownsville in the US, and writing regular internet reports entitled Views from Alongside a Border. \u201cThese people came here,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause they wanted to be safe. Yet over in Matamoros, they are prey to deadly criminals, and here they are met with a system carefully designed to fail them. They can have no idea of the evil genius of our immigration and asylum apparatus, satanic in its cleverness in keeping them out, and in danger.\u201d In January 2019, despite an outcry over child separation, the Trump administration introduced \u201cMigrant Protection Protocols\u201d, whereby asylum seekers, rather than wait for their \u201ccredible fear\u201d interview in the US (as per the 1939 Montevideo treaty on political asylum), are sent back to wait in Mexico. The Mexican government of leftwing president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has given full support, earning compliments from Trump for \u201cspectacular\u201d results: some 58,000 asylum seekers are now reported returned to, and waiting in, Mexico. Immigration courts on the US side are perfunctory and dysfunctional. I was forbidden entry to the huge tent \u2013 or \u201csoft-sided facility\u201d as the government calls it \u2013 erected on the Brownsville side of the river to hear pleas by video link. But I did visit two courts dealing with detained migrants at nearby McAllen and Port Isabel: rows of shackled, confused, weary people hustled through production-line \u201cjustice\u201d, with, in some cases, no more exchange with the bench than a nod to indicate understanding of their \u201crights\u201d, before deportation. Beside the Gateway bridge connecting Matamoros to downtown Brownsville, across a few yards of river and reed bank, is a tent city of around 1,000 people, encamped for safety in numbers, mostly \u201cwaiting in Mexico\u201d for the date on their crumpled but clasped Notice to Appear given to them before they were sent back under Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy. A higher proportion are returned to Matamoros than anywhere else on the border, for all the dangers. My book Amexica ended with the story of the massacre of 72 migrants at San Fernando, Tamaulipas, in 2010. Migrant massacres and disappearances have become increasingly common. On Christmas Eve 2011, 15 migrants were dragged from a diocesan shelter in Matamoros, and never seen again; scores of disappearances have followed. Staff at the bus station have witnessed, on many occasions, the macabre arrival of baggage belonging to migrants on board coaches from the interior, with no one to claim them. In Nuevo Laredo last month, Aar\u00f3n M\u00e9ndez, manager of a Presbyterian shelter, was abducted after refusing to hand over those in his care to a unit of gunmen. Seifert had put me in touch with his opposite number on the Matamoros side of the border, the kind of person these situations throw up, hurricane heroines and heroes of the hour. Glady Ca\u00f1as Aguilar is in her \u201coffice\u201d in a small row of shops. A crowd awaits her; everyone wants a piece of her \u2013 a moment with her. About 80% of migrants, she says, come from Honduras, fleeing gang violence \u2013 also from El Salvador, Guatemala, Cuba, and some from Africa. \u201cPeople often stay for months,\u201d she says, crossing in groups of 15 according to a system operated by the border patrol known as \u201cmetering\u201d, which limits the number of people who may apply, creating numbered waiting lists on the Mexican side. \u201cMore than 250 tents and we cope,\u201d she says, \u201cjust about, but they\u2019ve been here too long and it\u2019s all too much \u2013 chicken pox, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and waiting, waiting\u2026 Here, they\u2019re safe, but out in the town, absolutely not.\u201d Ca\u00f1as Aguilar blames a \u201cfalta de amor\u201d \u2013 lack of love \u2013 in the world. But she must go now: a group of Tzotzil Mayans has arrived from the Mexican town of San Juan Chamula, evicted by fighting between rival political militias; she takes control of the chaotic scene, distributing sanitary kit and clothes \u2013 including a silver-sequined tunic for a girl called Flora. Back to Ju\u00e1rez In Amexica I quoted the great writer of the borderland Charles Bowden: \u201cIf the Pulitzer [prize] stands for publishing the truth against the might of governments and at risk of your life, then this year the nabobs of American journalism have it easy: give all the newspaper prizes to the people of El Diario.\u201d Ten years ago, Sandra Rodr\u00edguez was mourning the loss of her colleague on Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s daily newspaper, El Diario. Armando Rodr\u00edguez was shot dead in his car as he prepared to take his daughter to school in November 2008. Sandra Rodr\u00edguez took the same risks, wrote the same kind of stories for which her friend died. She was preoccupied by what she called \u201cthe culture of impunity in this city, from its very design, to the way the economy works; from the street to the top\u201d. She published an important book of reportage from the city in 2012, La F\u00e1brica del Crimen (The Crime Factory), which was published in English as The Story of Vicente, Who Murdered His Mother, His Father and His Sister, which he did. Rather than write about capos and sicarios, Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s subject is the brutalisation of Mexican society. Vicente did what he did, he said, \u201cporque puedo\u201d, because I can. Over the past decade, Rodr\u00edguez reflects, \u201cthe story of Mexico is as Vicente predicted: you can do whatever you want, with impunity. You can kill whoever you want, kill in broad daylight, kill a journalist, disappear 43 students \u2013 and get away with it. Vicente has become a metaphor for the whole country.\u201d As news editor, Rodr\u00edguez faces a dilemma. \u201cWe have a picture,\u201d she says, \u201cof two people walking past a corpse, and they don\u2019t even glance at it \u2013 this is Ju\u00e1rez after 10 years. I want it on the front page, but we don\u2019t have a story to go with it. Or we have a 16-year-old killed, without a birth certificate or school record. Again, this should be front-page news. But it\u2019s not: people being killed is no longer news in Ju\u00e1rez, or the rest of Mexico \u2013 killing has become normal and crime has become a habit.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez has since lost another colleague, Miroslava Breach, an investigative journalist from her home town of Chiuhuahua, murdered in 2017 when leaving home, like Armando. Twelve journalists have been killed in Mexico so far this year, so that \u2013 according to a report on US National Public Radio last month, Mexico has overtaken Syria as the most dangerous country in the world for journalists. On the day I crossed from El Paso to Ju\u00e1rez this time, a correspondent from National Geographic was shot and wounded. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d says Rodr\u00edguez. \u201cIt comes from the same disease, impunity. They do it because they know they can, to silence the press.\u201d And yet, for all this, when a friend in our company asks: \u201cHave you ever been really happy?\u201d Rodr\u00edguez does not hesitate: \u201cYes, my city makes me happy. I love Ju\u00e1rez; it kills people, but it gives me a sense of life, unconnected to the killings, to do with its complexity, and its people.\u201d Kill it certainly does. The culture of impunity, says Rodr\u00edguez, has its roots in the 90s, \u201cwith the killing of 300 women in this city, when we realised nothing would happen to the killers\u201d. The so-called \u201cFemicidio\u201d brought Ju\u00e1rez to the attention of the world, and me back to the city in 1999. The misogynist \u201cstyle\u201d of killing \u2013 a word used \u201cnot lightly\u201d by anthropologist Cecilia Ball\u00ed in Amexica \u2013 seemed to take the violence to another level. In her thesis, Ball\u00ed explored this \u201csexual murder\u201d in the light of a \u201chypermasculinity in US-Mexico border zones, informed by the history, style and logic of militarisation and organised crime\u201d. Among the mothers who suffered unfathomable grief at the abduction, violation and murder of a daughter was Paula Flores, the body of whose 17-year-old daughter Maria Sagrario Gonz\u00e1lez was found dumped in the desert in April 1998. She had disappeared after leaving home early to take a bus to work in one of Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s hundreds of maquiladora assembly plants, bedrock of the city\u2019s economy. My chapter on the Femicidio opened with Paula imploring the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which Sagrario wore around her neck: \u201cWhere were you when they did this to my little girl?\u201d Flores\u2019s face has changed remarkably little since I last saw her 10 years ago, or indeed since I first interviewed her in 1999 and again in 2002. It carries that same wounded but indomitable fortitude. She lives in the same house, attached to the family\u2019s grocery store at the top of the Anapra barrio, a quarter called Lomas de Poleo, on the north-western outskirts of town, right against the border. An old, repainted American school bus grinds up the dusty slope, with the mountains behind El Paso as backdrop. \u201cTime passes,\u201d Flores says. \u201cIt\u2019s been 21 years now and everything is the same \u2013 nothing has happened. We are marked for life, and will remain so while there is no reckoning with what happened. There can be no recovery. And it continues: women keep disappearing, keep being murdered.\u201d On the other hand, \u201cI have my store, and my family. At weekends we are all together, all from Durango, though my grandchildren were born here. Eleven of them now, some of the age Maria Sagrario was, and that can be traumatic.\u201d In 2005, a man called Jos\u00e9 Luis Hern\u00e1ndez was jailed for the murder of Maria Sagrario \u2013 sentenced for 28 years. \u201cBut I fear he will be out much sooner,\u201d says Flores. That is not the end of the matter: \u201cHe said he was paid $800 to be part of this. But by whom? Who else was involved, and why? We have always said that everything rests with the authorities, that the authorities were complicit in the murder of women in Ju\u00e1rez. \u201cEvery year, on the anniversary \u2013 16 April \u2013 we get together and repaint the crosses,\u201d says Flores \u2013 they are black on a pink background, painted or placed on walls, lamp-posts and public spaces around the city. In 2012, the mayor of Ju\u00e1rez, Hector Murgu\u00eda, announced he would ban this practice and \u201capply the law\u201d on defacement of public space. \u201cHe threatened us, but we did it,\u201d says Flores, though \u201cthis year only four of us turned up.\u201d The mothers of six murdered women, including Flores, filed a suit \u2013 Silvia Elena Rivera Morales et al vs Mexico \u2013 through the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, over the authorities\u2019 abrogation of responsibility. A hearing was held in Washington DC on 29 September. \u201cThough my daughter\u2019s case is from 21 years ago,\u201d Flores told the commission, \u201cI still feel the same pain of my daughter not being here. She deserves justice.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she says now in her kitchen, \u201cwith the other mothers, we\u2019re still pushing this. It was all very nice there in Washington, and the president of the court offered his sympathies. But they\u2019ve had this case since 2007, and it\u2019s a verdict we need, not sympathy. I don\u2019t think they have any idea of the emotional toll, the pain involved.\u201d Flores seems rightly exhausted with trying to find words for the unspeakable. Two of her other daughters arrive, and there\u2019s a delicious lunch of spicy beans, cheese and tortillas, a portrait of Maria Sagrario staring down from the back wall. There\u2019s discussion of music, grandchildren, climate crisis and life around the barrio. We\u2019re done for today with what Edgar Allan Poe called \u201cthe hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed\u201d. But there\u2019s one final question: where was the Virgin of Guadalupe when they did that? \u201cI asked the same question to the cross on her coffin, and the virgin on her locket: why didn\u2019t she protect her?\u201d says Flores, \u201cand I\u2019ve asked it every day since, and I hear no answer. I still believe. But how can it be? Maria Sagrario was not against God; she was a believer, she sang in church, and helped at Sunday school. During Lent that year, I prayed for the protection of my daughters. Three days later, Maria Sagrario disappeared. \u201cI try to ask myself not so much \u2018Why did she die?\u2019 but \u2018For what?\u2019 Maybe for the school. Maybe so that with the help of the other mothers, I can raise awareness about what is happening here. So the world would take notice \u2013 maybe.\u201d A 10th anniversary edition of Amexica by Ed Vulliamy will be published by Vintage books next year.

Labour, among a welter of policy initiatives, offers comprehensive improvements to public services with one hand, but takes away from most older people with promises of higher capital gains tax and a lower inheritance tax threshold. It\u2019s true that outside London and the south-east the wealth stashed in property and savings declines sharply. Yet in an uncertain world, where so many postwar certainties are broken, greed and fear should never be discounted as a motivation for voting, wherever people live and no matter how small their savings. You would think, in this atmosphere, that one of the parties would have stepped forward with a comprehensive social care plan, one that took away the fear of old age. With a reliable social care in place, older voters could afford to be more optimistic, and maybe share some of their wealth to tackle issues like climate change. Labour has a partial plan in its manifesto that would pay for at-home personal care but nothing else, leaving the claimant having to cover other facilities and residential care. Labour says it will help with these costs \u2013 though, crucially, it hints at means testing, which would make the better-off pay \u00a3100,000 or more towards their care. By contrast, Boris Johnson has simply said that no one will need to sell their home. Why did he say this? Because No 10 plays to the fears of older voters while Labour almost denies their existence. The Tories know they are working with a group who want to pass on their unearned gains from property and shares to their family while limiting how much they pay in tax towards their care. Labour was in a position before the election to chart a way through this mess. It still should.",

Putney, Southport and Guildford all elected Conservative MPs last time, despite voting heavily to remain in the 2016 referendum. Currently, the Conservatives lead Labour in Putney (by 3%) and Southport (by 8%). Guildford is almost neck-and-neck between the Lib Dems (41%) and the Conservatives (40%). Given margins of error on local surveys with samples of 500, all three seats are in play.

The 50 seats include 33 in England and Wales that elected Tory MPs last time. The Lib Dems are recommended in 18 seats, Labour in 13 and former Conservatives in two: Dominic Grieve and David Gauke, now standing as independents and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/06/john-major-backs-three-ex-tory-independents-in-election-campaign\" title=\"\">backed this weekend by John Major</a>.

Major\u2019s support risks siphoning votes from the Lib Dems, and letting the Conservatives retain the seat.)</p> <p>It should be stressed that there are many other marginals where Labour is the clear challenger to the Conservatives, but in almost all of these seats the Lib Dems are out of the running. There is little need here for a tactical guide to recommend Labour.</p> <p>In general, where the incumbent MP is Labour, they are the best placed to keep out the Tories. There are four exceptions: two in Scotland and one each in England and Wales. Here, without tactical support for the best-placed non-Labour candidate, Conservative gains are a real possibility. However, in two three-way marginals, Labour needs to win over local supporters of the Lib Dems (Portsmouth South) and Plaid Cymru (Ynys M\u00f4n) to be sure of defeating the Conservatives.</p> <p>Scotland presents a specific challenge. A number of traditional Labour strongholds went SNP in 2015 and then Conservative in 2017.

      "bodyText": "On current trends, voters will deliver a contradictory verdict on Thursday night. The Conservatives are on course for an overall majority in parliament \u2013 but most voters will back parties that want to block an early Brexit. If turnout is similar to last time, the 14 to 15 million who will support the Conservatives or Brexit party will be outnumbered by the 16 to 17 million who will vote Labour, Liberal Democrat, Green, SNP or Plaid Cymru. Tactical voting is not new, but it has a special significance this week. If it happens in enough constituencies, it can ensure that the two-million majority opposed to Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan is reflected in the new House of Commons. The map below shows 50 seats where tactical voting could keep the Conservatives out. Most tactical voting websites draw on one or two sets of polling data, which risk ignoring the specific circumstances of individual constituencies. The guide draws on a wider range of information \u2013 detailed big-sample national polls, but also constituency surveys (including those reported week by week in the Observer), past election results and local activity, such as the recent student registration drives in some key seats (one is Brunel University, in Johnson\u2019s own constituency, Uxbridge). The three latest constituency surveys underline the potential impact of tactical voting. Putney, Southport and Guildford all elected Conservative MPs last time, despite voting heavily to remain in the 2016 referendum. Currently, the Conservatives lead Labour in Putney (by 3%) and Southport (by 8%). Guildford is almost neck-and-neck between the Lib Dems (41%) and the Conservatives (40%). Given margins of error on local surveys with samples of 500, all three seats are in play. Enough tactical votes for Labour in Putney and Southport, and the Lib Dems in Guildford, could defeat the Tories in all three seats. However, without tactical voting, these three seats \u2013 like many others \u2013 may well return pro-Brexit MPs, despite having clear Remain majorities, because of the way the anti-Conservative vote divides. In the map, each choice is briefly explained. The 50 seats include 33 in England and Wales that elected Tory MPs last time. The Lib Dems are recommended in 18 seats, Labour in 13 and former Conservatives in two: Dominic Grieve and David Gauke, now standing as independents and backed this weekend by John Major. (Another former Tory backed by Major, Anne Milton in Guildford, has only 7% support in our latest poll. Major\u2019s support risks siphoning votes from the Lib Dems, and letting the Conservatives retain the seat.) It should be stressed that there are many other marginals where Labour is the clear challenger to the Conservatives, but in almost all of these seats the Lib Dems are out of the running. There is little need here for a tactical guide to recommend Labour. In general, where the incumbent MP is Labour, they are the best placed to keep out the Tories. There are four exceptions: two in Scotland and one each in England and Wales. Here, without tactical support for the best-placed non-Labour candidate, Conservative gains are a real possibility. However, in two three-way marginals, Labour needs to win over local supporters of the Lib Dems (Portsmouth South) and Plaid Cymru (Ynys M\u00f4n) to be sure of defeating the Conservatives. Scotland presents a specific challenge. A number of traditional Labour strongholds went SNP in 2015 and then Conservative in 2017. In these \u2013 as well as Gordon, a former Lib Dem seat, and Moray, once an SNP bastion \u2013 the SNP are now best placed to see off the Conservatives.

The surprise outcomes of the 2016 Brexit referendum and 2017 general election stung pollsters and pundits alike.</p> <p>Last week, the polling expert Sir John Curtice said Boris Johnson was by no means home and dry, pointing out that if Labour could increase its share of Remain voters by polling day it could yet spring a surprise.</p> <p>Broadly, he and others will go no further than to say there are three possible outcomes: a Tory majority, another hung parliament, or (by far the least likely at this stage) a Labour majority.</p> <p>So what will each of these mean for the party leaders, for Brexit, the economy and government spending, and for the union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/dec/05/election-polls-uk-2019-latest-opinion-poll-tracker\">Election polls UK 2019: Tories maintain lead over Labour with one week to go</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>A Tory majority</h2> <p><strong>Party leaders</strong></p> <p>Johnson will be secure in No 10 for the foreseeable future, at least until another Brexit crisis erupts (which could happen by the end of next year). But Jeremy Corbyn, having failed to beat the Tories for a second time, will almost certainly be on the way out. The big question will be when. Will he stay on for a short time to allow a \u201cperiod of reflection\u201d as Len McCluskey, the boss of Unite, suggests?</p> <p>At some point before the autumn a succession battle will ensue between candidates from the Corbynite left, soft left and moderate wings. If the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, fails to win more seats for her party, or loses some, she could be in trouble too, though most Lib Dems think she will cling on (assuming she wins her own seat) so long as her party avoids a total flop.</p> <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p> <p>Johnson will get his deal through parliament and the UK will leave the EU on 31 January. But that will not be the end of the Brexit saga. The UK will then enter the transition period, during which it must agree a trade deal with the EU to avoid leaving with no agreement at the end of 2020.</p> <p>If Johnson wants to extend the transition he can ask the EU, but he must do so by the end of June next year. He has said he will not ask for an extension under any circumstances. But trade deals usually take several years to negotiate and ratify, not a few months. A Johnson government could be in another full-blown Brexit crisis \u2013 with familiar arguments raging about the merits of a further extension and the danger of a no-deal exit \u2013 very soon.</p> <p><strong>The economy/tax/spending</strong></p> <p>One key Tory campaign message has been that austerity is now over. Johnson\u2019s Tories will loosen the purse strings. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has promised a \u00a313.8bn spending surge across departments by 2021, with more for the NHS, schools and police.</p> <p>Johnson has pledged to cut national insurance, business rates, construction tax and research and development tax. A planned 2% reduction in corporation tax has been put off to pay for extra NHS funding. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies says the Tory plans do not add up.</p> <p><strong>The future of the union</strong></p> <p>Brexit has already fired up the debate about Scottish independence. If the Tories form a majority government \u2013 and the anti-Brexit SNP do well north of the border \u2013 the pressure for a second referendum will intensify. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, says her country\u2019s opposition to Brexit has reinforced the case for independence and she wants another referendum either in 2020 or 2021.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, which would establish a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, has also led to calls from Irish nationalists for a referendum on unification of the north and south of the island.</p> <h2>A hung parliament</h2> <p><strong>Party leaders</strong></p> <p>If the Tories fail to win a majority, Johnson will be down but not necessarily out. As the sitting prime minister (assuming he does not resign) he will get the first shot at forming a minority government, whether his party has the most seats or not. But finding partners to prop him up will be difficult.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/06/how-credible-jeremy-corbyn-boris-johnson-claims-bbc-debate\">How credible are Corbyn and Johnson's BBC debate claims?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The DUP detest Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal and the Lib Dems say they won\u2019t go near the Tories, not least because they want to reverse Brexit, and because they are still recovering from the 2010-15 Tory/Lib Dem coalition. If Johnson fails to form a government and Labour does, he will be in big trouble. If Labour gets its chance, it could team up with the SNP and agree to back a second independence referendum, two years or more down the line. The Lib Dems have said they would not think of propping up a Labour government if it were led by Corbyn. So he may be pressured to step aside.</p> <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p> <p>A hung parliament is likely to halt Johnson\u2019s plan to leave the EU on 31 January and could open a route to the UK staying in the EU. Without a majority, and with the DUP opposed, it is hard to see how he could get his Brexit deal through parliament, unless he agreed to make approval of it subject to a second referendum, with the other option being to remain in the EU. This could be his only hope. If a Labour minority government were formed then Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP would all favour a second referendum as the way to break the impasse, though the details of what question would be asked would be the subject of difficult negotiation.</p> <p><strong>The economy/tax/spending</strong></p> <p>Money will be at the heart of negotiations between parties haggling over arrangements for a minority government. And the spending plans of both the Tories and Labour as revealed during the campaign will be unlikely to survive any deal-making. After the 2017 election the DUP struck a hard bargain as the price of its support for Theresa May\u2019s government, winning \u00a31bn more for Northern Ireland in return for its participation in a \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d arrangement. If the Lib Dems or SNP were to back a Labour-led government, both would demand a financial price.</p> <p><strong>The future of the union</strong></p> <p>A hung parliament could advance or damage the cause of Scottish independence. If more deadlock in the Commons leads to a second Brexit referendum and a Remain vote meaning the UK stays in the EU, support for independence could dwindle somewhat. But if the SNP can act as kingmakers for a Labour minority government, they would only do so with the guarantee that Labour would back another independence vote. Jeremy Corbyn has said he would not support another Scottish independence referendum for at least two years, suggesting he could do so after that.</p> <h2>A Labour majority</h2> <p><strong>Party leaders</strong></p> <p>If Labour wins outright, Corbyn will be installed in Downing Street, probably until another general election in five years\u2019 time, unless he decides to hand over earlier. But Johnson will almost certainly be out after just five months in No 10, and the Conservative party will be plunged into a huge battle over its future direction. Swinson\u2019s future will depend on how well or badly her party has performed, but a poor performance that has contributed to a Corbyn government will be hard for Lib Dems to stomach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/06/honk-if-you-support-corbyn-have-you-been-following-the-election-this-week\">Honk if you support Corbyn: have you been following the election this week?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p> <p>Labour will try to renegotiate its own Brexit deal with Brussels and then make that the subject of a second referendum, with the other option being to remain.

      "bodyText": "After five weeks of campaigning, the Tories are ahead of Labour in the polls \u2013 but few experts dare predict the result. The surprise outcomes of the 2016 Brexit referendum and 2017 general election stung pollsters and pundits alike. Last week, the polling expert Sir John Curtice said Boris Johnson was by no means home and dry, pointing out that if Labour could increase its share of Remain voters by polling day it could yet spring a surprise. Broadly, he and others will go no further than to say there are three possible outcomes: a Tory majority, another hung parliament, or (by far the least likely at this stage) a Labour majority. So what will each of these mean for the party leaders, for Brexit, the economy and government spending, and for the union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? A Tory majority Party leaders Johnson will be secure in No 10 for the foreseeable future, at least until another Brexit crisis erupts (which could happen by the end of next year). But Jeremy Corbyn, having failed to beat the Tories for a second time, will almost certainly be on the way out. The big question will be when. Will he stay on for a short time to allow a \u201cperiod of reflection\u201d as Len McCluskey, the boss of Unite, suggests? At some point before the autumn a succession battle will ensue between candidates from the Corbynite left, soft left and moderate wings. If the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, fails to win more seats for her party, or loses some, she could be in trouble too, though most Lib Dems think she will cling on (assuming she wins her own seat) so long as her party avoids a total flop. Brexit Johnson will get his deal through parliament and the UK will leave the EU on 31 January. But that will not be the end of the Brexit saga. The UK will then enter the transition period, during which it must agree a trade deal with the EU to avoid leaving with no agreement at the end of 2020. If Johnson wants to extend the transition he can ask the EU, but he must do so by the end of June next year. He has said he will not ask for an extension under any circumstances. But trade deals usually take several years to negotiate and ratify, not a few months. A Johnson government could be in another full-blown Brexit crisis \u2013 with familiar arguments raging about the merits of a further extension and the danger of a no-deal exit \u2013 very soon. The economy/tax/spending One key Tory campaign message has been that austerity is now over. Johnson\u2019s Tories will loosen the purse strings. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has promised a \u00a313.8bn spending surge across departments by 2021, with more for the NHS, schools and police. Johnson has pledged to cut national insurance, business rates, construction tax and research and development tax. A planned 2% reduction in corporation tax has been put off to pay for extra NHS funding. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies says the Tory plans do not add up. The future of the union Brexit has already fired up the debate about Scottish independence. If the Tories form a majority government \u2013 and the anti-Brexit SNP do well north of the border \u2013 the pressure for a second referendum will intensify. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, says her country\u2019s opposition to Brexit has reinforced the case for independence and she wants another referendum either in 2020 or 2021. Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, which would establish a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, has also led to calls from Irish nationalists for a referendum on unification of the north and south of the island. A hung parliament Party leaders If the Tories fail to win a majority, Johnson will be down but not necessarily out. As the sitting prime minister (assuming he does not resign) he will get the first shot at forming a minority government, whether his party has the most seats or not. But finding partners to prop him up will be difficult. The DUP detest Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal and the Lib Dems say they won\u2019t go near the Tories, not least because they want to reverse Brexit, and because they are still recovering from the 2010-15 Tory/Lib Dem coalition. If Johnson fails to form a government and Labour does, he will be in big trouble. If Labour gets its chance, it could team up with the SNP and agree to back a second independence referendum, two years or more down the line. The Lib Dems have said they would not think of propping up a Labour government if it were led by Corbyn. So he may be pressured to step aside. Brexit A hung parliament is likely to halt Johnson\u2019s plan to leave the EU on 31 January and could open a route to the UK staying in the EU. Without a majority, and with the DUP opposed, it is hard to see how he could get his Brexit deal through parliament, unless he agreed to make approval of it subject to a second referendum, with the other option being to remain in the EU. This could be his only hope. If a Labour minority government were formed then Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP would all favour a second referendum as the way to break the impasse, though the details of what question would be asked would be the subject of difficult negotiation. The economy/tax/spending Money will be at the heart of negotiations between parties haggling over arrangements for a minority government. And the spending plans of both the Tories and Labour as revealed during the campaign will be unlikely to survive any deal-making. After the 2017 election the DUP struck a hard bargain as the price of its support for Theresa May\u2019s government, winning \u00a31bn more for Northern Ireland in return for its participation in a \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d arrangement. If the Lib Dems or SNP were to back a Labour-led government, both would demand a financial price. The future of the union A hung parliament could advance or damage the cause of Scottish independence. If more deadlock in the Commons leads to a second Brexit referendum and a Remain vote meaning the UK stays in the EU, support for independence could dwindle somewhat. But if the SNP can act as kingmakers for a Labour minority government, they would only do so with the guarantee that Labour would back another independence vote. Jeremy Corbyn has said he would not support another Scottish independence referendum for at least two years, suggesting he could do so after that. A Labour majority Party leaders If Labour wins outright, Corbyn will be installed in Downing Street, probably until another general election in five years\u2019 time, unless he decides to hand over earlier. But Johnson will almost certainly be out after just five months in No 10, and the Conservative party will be plunged into a huge battle over its future direction. Swinson\u2019s future will depend on how well or badly her party has performed, but a poor performance that has contributed to a Corbyn government will be hard for Lib Dems to stomach. Brexit Labour will try to renegotiate its own Brexit deal with Brussels and then make that the subject of a second referendum, with the other option being to remain. Corbyn has said he will stay neutral in those circumstances, though members of his shadow cabinet are likely to be given the freedom to campaign as they wish. Experts believe Labour will struggle to negotiate a new deal and hold a referendum within six months, but if it wins power it will not worry too much if that timetable has to be stretched. Labour has promised that the result of a second referendum would be legally binding, meaning parliament would have to enforce it.

      "bodyText": "A 23-year-old rape victim, on the way to a court hearing, is doused in kerosene and set alight. She dies in hospital with 95% burns. Four men accused of the brutal gang rape of a young vet in Hyderabad are shot dead by police, supposedly after they tried to escape. The two incidents sum up the horrors of rape and of police extrajudicial killings in India. Violence against women has become a volatile issue in the country. Government figures show that 33,658 cases of rape were reported to the police in 2017, an average of 92 rapes every day. At the same time, the justice system in India moves exceptionally slowly. In 2017, the courts opened 18,300 new rape-related cases, but more than 127,800 remained pending at the end of the year. The length of time that court cases take often leads to a failure of prosecution. If rape and the failure of the judicial system is an issue, so is police brutality. \u201cEncounters\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for extrajudicial police killings of suspects \u2013 have become increasingly frequent. In Telangana alone, the state in which the latest killings took place, there have been seven other \u201cencounters\u201d over the past decade. In the words of one high court judge: \u201cThere is not a single lawless group in the country whose record of crime comes anywhere near that of the single organised unit called the Indian police force.\u201d The depth of anger about violence against women has led many in India to cheer the killings. Vengeance, though, is no substitute for justice. And allowing the police to kill with impunity is no cause for celebration, least of all for women. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been another stellar season for the WBBL and it ends with deserving champions. The standalone format has been a success, the quality of the cricket continues to improve, and the crowds and TV audiences tell their own story. Thanks for joining us throughout the campaign, and especially during this finals weekend. Beth Mooney has just been named as the player of the match for her 56 from 45 balls, not to mention an excellent stint behind the stumps. For the second year running Laura Harris hits the winning run. For the second year running Beth Mooney\u2019s composure leads her side to victory. The best side of the regular season, the best side in the finals. Brisbane Heat take a bow. 19.1 overs: Brisbane Heat 162-4 (Mooney 56, L Harris 19) Harris hits the winning run, drilling Bates through mid-on and sparking wild celebrations around Allan Border Field. Brisbane Heat, back-to-back WBBL champions. What a team. 18th over: Brisbane Heat 161-4 (Mooney 56, L Harris 18) Coyte with the ball for the Strikers. The Heat fans gathering in the stands ready to celebrate. Harris nudges them one run closer to a party before Mooney is miles out running for a second but McPharlin can\u2019t make the simple gather with the gloves. The target falls to just two when Mooney strokes a single before the over ends with Harris nurdling the scores level. It will all be over very very soon. Two years in a row, just magnificent. So composed, calmly rotating the strike. A WBBL legend. 17th over: Brisbane Heat 156-4 (Mooney 53, L Harris 16) Schutt returns for her final over, but it\u2019s to no avail and she ends her day wicketless. Just six runs left for Brisbane to go back-to-back. 16th over: Brisbane Heat 148-4 (Mooney 52, L Harris 12) Pressure, what pressure? Laura Harris strides out and plonks a mow to cow corner for four then pulls a full-toss to square-leg for four more. For good measure she guides a late cut over the leaping gully to make it three boundaries for the over. McGrath ends with 2/34. Harris never looked in during her six-ball stay and it ends when she misses with an ugly swipe at a canny McGrath cutter. 15th over: Brisbane Heat 133-3 (Mooney 51, G Harris 2) Mooney brings up her ninth half-century of the season, taking her WBBL5 tally beyond 700 runs in the process. It arrives in a good over of Wellington legspin though, one that is full of uncertainty at the crease and worth just five runs. 14th over: Brisbane Heat 128-3 (Mooney 47, G Harris 1) Terrific over from Coyte, including the wicket of Jonassen, but Adelaide let themselves down at the end by allowing Harris a needless single that Mooney punishes by driving serenly through the covers for four. Schutt couldn\u2019t force a breakthrough but Coyte could! In the slot for Jonassen but she deposits a lusty swipe straight to Patterson on the midwicket fence and she holds on to a smart chance. Can Adelaide capitalise? 13th over: Brisbane Heat 121-2 (Mooney 41, Jonassen 33) Can Schutt provide that miracle? The international superstar is brought back for her third over much earlier than scheduled, but her team needs her golden arm right now. It\u2019s a tight and testing over, but no breakthrough. 12th over: Brisbane Heat 114-2 (Mooney 38, Jonassen 32) McGrath has bowled well so far today but her third over begins with a short and wide long-hop that Mooney guides through third for four. After rotating the strike Jonassen then finds the fence, just waiting in the crease and helping the ball on its way to the square-leg boundary. The run-rate is now exactly a run a ball. Adelaide need a miracle. 11th over: Brisbane Heat 103-2 (Mooney 32, Jonassen 27) Devine returns to the attack, and after falling cheaply with the bat and suffering that Johnson assault earlier on, her day somehow gets worse. A shorter ball gets big on Jonassen and the Heat batter mistimes it tamely straight to Wellington at cover, but the allrounder drops the simplest of catches. This is Archer to Williamson to Denly territory. Heartbreaking for the bowler. Of course Jonassen drills consecutive boundaries to rub salt into the wound. 10th over: Brisbane Heat 91-2 (Mooney 30, Jonassen 17) Just the four from a tight Coyte over. Heat happy just to knock the ball around and take the singles when offered. Brisbane cruising at the halfway stage of their chase. 9th over: Brisbane Heat 87-2 (Mooney 28, Jonassen 15) The legspin of Amanda-Jade Wellington is now called upon and the star of Adelaide\u2019s batting begins promisingly, before Jonassen holds her shape nicely through a lofted straight drive for four. She follows that up by whipping one behind square on the on side for four more and Brisbane continue their canter to consecutive titles. 8th over: Brisbane Heat 75-2 (Mooney 25, Jonassen 6) Suzie Bates brings herself on and she beats Jonassen with her opening couple of deliveries angling across the left-hander from over the wicket. It almost prompts a dismissal but Jonassen\u2019s release shot down the ground bounces just short of the diving long-on fielder. Bates ends her over well, beating Mooney for bounce, then conceding a couple behind point. 7th over: Brisbane Heat 70-2 (Mooney 23, Jonassen 3) Sarah Coyte\u2019s turn to have a bowl but she opens with five legside wides. The Heat milk six singles thereafter to keep up their march to the WBBL title. 6th over: Brisbane Heat 59-2 (Mooney 20, Jonassen 0) Johnson may have departed but the runs keep on flowing, Mooney cue-ending a four through the vacant cordon at the start of McGrath\u2019s second over. McGrath fights back well though, beating Mooney\u2019s outside edge and pinning both Heat batters on the crease to limit the damage. 5th over: Brisbane Heat 54-2 (Mooney 15) That\u2019s what Johnson has been stuck in to do! Boy oh boy! The first ball of Devine\u2019s second over is length on leg stump and Johnson timed it sweet as you like, flicking it onto the roof of the temporary stand behind square leg. Yeah, she does it again two deliveries later. Monstrous hitting. AND AGAIN! Three sixes in four balls, all landing on the roof of the camera gantry over square leg. AND ANOTHER ONE! Straighter this time, whacking a full half-volley over long-on. This is incredible. Devine getting a taste of her own big-hitting medicine. But she gets her own back, deceiving Johnson with a slower ball to round the over out and taking a simple return catch off a leading edge. What an over: 6-0-6-6-6-W. Johnson 27 from just 11 balls. 4th over: Brisbane Heat 30-1 (Mooney 15, Johnson 3) Brisbane have sent in Sammy-Jo Johnson as a pinch-hitter but she can\u2019t get any of her first three deliveries off the square. Superb over from McGrath, slowing the Heat\u2019s momentum. McGrath botched a catch an over ago but she\u2019s redeemed herself with the ball in hand. Her first delivery is chipped tamely to mid-on by Green and the Strikers are jubilant. 3rd over: Brisbane Heat 27-0 (Mooney 15, Green 11) Oh dear. The opening delivery of Schutt\u2019s second over is skied by Green off a leading edge but McGrath struggles to steady herself coming in from midwicket and what should have been a routine chance goes begging. No dot-balls in another good over for Brisbane. 2nd over: Brisbane Heat 20-0 (Mooney 11, Green 8) Sophie Devine shares the new ball and she almost earns a wicket from her first delivery but Green\u2019s top-edged swat to leg lands safely. There\u2019s nothing edgy about Green a couple of balls later, lofting a flick through midwicket for four that sounded delightfully crisp off the bat. Another over worth 10 runs and the Heat continue their march. 1st over: Brisbane Heat 10-0 (Mooney 9, Green 1) Schutt\u2019s tournament economy rate before this final is just 4.61 but Mooney pays her international colleague no respect, advancing down the pitch and driving her second delivery for four. Schutt responds by going around the wicket to the left-hander and sending down the ball of the match, an away swinger that moved even further off the pitch; think Flintoff v Gilchrist in 2005. Mooney adjusts by taking a leg stump guard, giving herself more width and square driving through the packed offside field for four, superb duel. A couple of singles take the tally to ten. Brisbane are off and running. Beth Mooney and Maddy Green are out in the middle preparing for what would be the biggest successful run-chase in WBBL grand final history. The formidable Megan Schutt has the ball in her hand. Game on again at Allan Border Field. A real rollercoaster of an innings from Adelaide ends with this WBBL final intriguingly poised. 161 feels about par and the Strikers have a lot to thank Amanda-Jade Wellington for. Her 55 rescued the Strikers from 93-5 and set up a fascinating run-chase. For Brisbane the early wicket of Sophie Devine was crucial and they chipped away consistently. The spin twins Amelia Kerr and Jess Jonassen were probably the pitck of the attack but it was Georgia Prestwidge that bagged the wicket of Devine. 20th over: Adelaide Strikers 161-6 (Wellington 55, Coyte 0) Kimmince bowls the final delivery of the innings and Wellington begins it by reverse-sweeping for four then picking a gap in the legside for two more. A canny slower ball earns dot before Wellington runs hard for a couple then slog sweeps for yet another boundary. Her innings ends along with her team when she tries to pinch a single from the final ball after playing and missing. Mooney and Kimmince make no mistake of the simple dismissal. 19th over: Adelaide Strikers 149-6 (Wellington 43) Wellington is flying now, reverse-sweeping Jonassen for four then lofting the spinner over her head for four more. A third boundary in a row arrives with another straight drive, forcing Jonassen to switch from around to over the wicket. Wellington responds by middling a switch hit that is superbly fielded in the ring. Adelaide run a single, bringing McPharlin on strike, but she perishes soon after, giving herself too much room, showing all three stumps, and Jonassen\u2019s dart hits the base of leg. 18th over: Adelaide Strikers 135-5 (Wellington 30, McPharlin 17) Amanda-Jade Wellington is doing a superb job for her team, batting Adelaide to something approaching competitive. She pushes the Strikers above 130 with a powerful cover drive off Sammy-Jo Johnson, which is backed up by Tegan McPharlin who straight drives for four more. Johnson ends with 1/35 from her four overs. 17th over: Adelaide Strikers 124-5 (Wellington 25, McPharlin 11) The experienced Jonassen is back for her third over and she expertly manipulates her pace and length to concede just four singles. 16th over: Adelaide Strikers 120-5 (Wellington 23, McPharlin 10) Kimmince returns with just four overs of the innings remaining and she is unfortunate to concede a boundary when McPharlin slices high over gully for four. There\u2019s much more control to Wellington\u2019s boundary a couple of deliveries later, the Strikers batter just timing the ball sweetly over long-off. And Wellington rounds out a 15-run over with another four, this time swatted like a line drive just over the diving fingertips of mid-off. A welcome burst from Adelaide. Can they post a defendable total? 15th over: Adelaide Strikers 105-5 (Wellington 14, McPharlin 4) Kerr finishes her spell with another excellent over to finish with figures of 1/22. She bowls with admirable flight and bravery - and no little turn both into and away from the right-handed Strikers. 14th over: Adelaide Strikers 99-5 (Wellington 12, McPharlin 0) The remainder of Prestwidge\u2019s over leaks down the legside. Wellington tickles one for four, another for a single, and in between there\u2019s a wide. Brisbane well on top of this fifth WBBL final. Prestwidge has been a revelation today and her third over, largely of shorter deliveries of different paces, again causes Adelaide difficulties. It\u2019s the change-up that bags her a second wicket, Patterson seizing on a rare fuller delivery but slapping a slog sweep straight to Kimmince at deep square leg. 13th over: Adelaide Strikers 92-4 (Patterson 12, Wellington 6) Kerr\u2019s third over is a beauty. It begins with a couple of dots that are followed by a wrong \u2018un that should have resulted in a stumping. Another dot and a single precede a nervy two courtesy of an overthrow after a direct hit from fine leg richochets away from the fielder backing up. 12th over: Adelaide Strikers 89-4 (Patterson 10, Wellington 5) Ten off Johnson\u2019s third over in a welcome fillip for Adelaide. Wellington leads the fightback with a crunching cover drive for four from her opening delivery. Jonassen\u2019s second over is another tip-and-run fest but the Heat have set their field well, building the pressure on the Strikers. That pressure eventually tells when Mack tries to pinch a single without realising Mooney had already collected a ball that dribbled into the legside, so as soon as the Strikers batter set off for the run the Heat keeper dived to smash over the stumps. Brilliant fielding. 11th over: Adelaide Strikers 79-4 (Patterson 5) 10th over: Adelaide Strikers 76-3 (Patterson 4, Mack 5) Prestwidge is back on and it\u2019s the first middle-overs spell of the day with the Strikers happy to tap and run for singles, half a dozen of them. That LBW shout, by the way, looked pretty good on replay, with a question mark over whether it struck Mack outside the line of off-stump. Not a shocker by any means to decline the appeal. 9th over: Adelaide Strikers 70-3 (Patterson 1, Mack 2) Brave over form Kerr, throwing the ball up and landing it wide of off stump, tempting the Strikers right-handers into a number of loose drives. The one exception is a wrong-un that strikes Mack bang in front but what looks a stone dead LBW is not given. Replays are slow to arrive but that looked like a huge let-off for Adelaide at first glance. Kerr\u2019s leggys get another whirl and she strikes second ball, tempting Kerr into a drive outside off stump but all the New Zealander can do is toe-end a catch to a diving Jonassen at point. Brisbane are right back on top of this contest once again. 8th over: Adelaide Strikers 65-2 (Bates 25, Patterson 0) Superb over from Sammy-Jo Johnson. As well as the wicket of McGrath she concedes just three runs and beats Bates\u2019 outside edge with a beautiful outswinger. Johnson\u2019s back for her second over and McGrath again escapes with a top-edged pull into no-man\u2019s land. She has no such luck next ball though, skewing a lofted off drive straight to Hinkley at mid-off. A much needed wicket for Brisbane. 7th over: Adelaide Strikers 62-1 (Bates 24, McGrath 31) Amelia Kerr is the sixth Heat bowler to join the fray, and the first legspinner. Adelaide continue to go hard at the ball but there\u2019s a lack of timing and placement, until Bates skips down the track and mows a tracer bullet to cow corner. The Strikers are on course for a massive total. 6th over: Adelaide Strikers 54-1 (Bates 18, McGrath 29) Kimmince is back but Adelaide\u2019s up-and-at-\u2019em approach continues. Bates charges the quick repeatedly without piercing the infield, while McGrath aims a huge heave to the onside that is lucky to land safely after looping into the air off a thick edge. 5th over: Adelaide Strikers 49-1 (Bates 14, McGrath 28) A new over a new bowler, this time Jess Jonassen, but Adelaide refuse to allow one of the premier spin bowlers in women\u2019s cricket to settle. Four singles, full of intent, are joined by a sweetly struck six over long-on, Bates proving she\u2019s not the only Strikers batter capable of clearing the fence. 4th over: Adelaide Strikers 39-1 (Bates 6, McGrath 26) Sammy-Jo Johnson makes it four different bowlers in a row to start the innings but she finds McGrath in serious touch. Three line and length dots are bookended by fours smashed though midwicket and cover and a straight-driven three that was hauled in superbly on the fence by Laura Harris. Despite losing Devine Adelaide will be delighted with their fast start. 3rd over: Adelaide Strikers 28-1 (Bates 6, McGrath 15) Spin into the attack early in the form of Grace Harris, but it\u2019s an inauspicious start with boundaries on both sides of the wicket in an over that goes for 12. 2nd over: Adelaide Strikers 16-1 (Bates 1, McGrath 8) What a start for Brisbane and Georgia Prestwidge. The wicket of the dangerous Devine in a powerplay over so early in the innings. Adelaide begin the rebuilding job with a free-hit six from the final delivery of the over after Prestwidge oversteps and then lobs down a leg-stump full toss that McGrath swats over the square-leg rope. Georgia Prestwidge shares the new ball - and she\u2019s not a powerplay bowler, so this is a bit of a funky play. AND IT WORKS! Would you believe it? The opening two deliveries of the over are short and wide outside off stump, the second of which is slashed hard by Devine, but all the way to the fielder on the third fence. A huge huge moment in this final and it means Devine cannot overhaul Ellyse Perry\u2019s all-time record for most runs in a WBBL season. 1st over: Adelaide Strikers 5-0 (Bates 0, Devine 5) Delissa Kimmince opens the bowling for Brisbane and her right-arm pace over the wicket causes some early problems for the right-handed Sophie Devine. A couple of dots - one full, one short - precede a genuine nick that carries through the vacant slip region for four. A couple more dots and a single complete an excellent start for the hosts. The Heat have just burst through a haze of smoke (artificial I should add) and onto Allan Border Field. They have been joined by Adelaide\u2019s Kiwi openers Suzie Bates and the peerless Sophie Devine. Play will be underway in a matter of seconds. Australian star Megan Schutt is delighted how the 2019 season has panned out. When I first heard how the WBBL season was going to be structured this year, I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical. I was worried there wasn\u2019t going to be the kind of effort going into creating a great atmosphere to generate the crowds for festival weekends. But the competition has delivered in every way possible and I couldn\u2019t be happier to be proven wrong. Megan Maurice was confident the Heat were the team to beat before yesterday\u2019s semi-finals. Presumably that opinion hasn\u2019t changed overnight. There\u2019s little to choose between the finalists though, Heat have won nine of their last 10, the Strikers seven of their last eight. Pitch: It\u2019s the same track as yesterday that performed unremarkably (which is no bad thing). There could be a bit of swing early on and the grass coverage means we\u2019re unlikely to see much deterioration. Whoever bats first would want to set a target in excess of 150. Weather: We\u2019re talking Brisbane in December, so would it shock you to find out it\u2019s hot and dry? Probably not. There\u2019s a fair amount of cloud obscuring the full force of the sun, and there\u2019s also an easterly breeze that is set to stiffen as the afternoon wears on and may become a factor. Both XIs are unchanged from the ones that performed so strongly yesterday. Brisbane chased well yesterday and they\u2019re looking to repeat the trick in the final. It\u2019s going to be a packed house in Queensland. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of the WBBL final between Brisbane Heat and Adelaide Strikers from Allan Border Field. Play will get underway around 2.40pm AEDT. It promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a standout standalone season for the WBBL. On display will be the top two sides on the regular season ladder, comprehensive semi-final victors, and in Sophie Devine and Beth Mooney the two players to dominate the competition this summer. For Brisbane it\u2019s a chance to go back-to-back following last year\u2019s upset of Sydney Sixers. For Adelaide it\u2019s a debut in the decider. Two evenly-matched sides who shared their two home-and-away matches earlier in the season. It promises to be a cracker.

Democrats elected the most diverse candidates yet in the 2018 midterms, including the first two Muslim women in Congress. Their presidential primary also broke new ground: last June it featured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/26/theres-white-male-bias-democrat-hopefuls-vie-for-african-american-votes\">six women, six people of colour and an openly gay man</a>.</p> <p>But the debate qualifying rules set by Tom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman who two years ago coined the \u201cbackbone\u201d claim, are said by critics to have disadvantaged candidates of colour by putting too much emphasis on access to financial support. So far only white aspirants have met the polling and donor thresholds to participate in the 19 December debate.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible look for the Democratic party,\u201d Allison said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a party that\u2019s half people of colour and 25% black. Women of colour are six times more likely to vote Democrat than a white guy. Women of colour are more likely to vote Democrat than white women because a majority of white women voted for Trump.</p> <p>\u201cSo we need a standard bearer for the Democratic party who speaks the language of solidarity, who\u2019s able to organise a multiracial coalition, and when you have an all-white stage you\u2019re missing lived experience, expertise and policy that helps to both inspire and speak to the very people we need to turn out to win in 2020. It\u2019s a terrifying prospect.\u201d</p> <p>Harris and Cory Booker, two African American senators, are both in their 50s and should be in their prime. Yet they have trailed three white septuagenarians \u2013 Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 as well as Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of a small city who would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/22/south-bend-mayor-presidential-candidate-2020\">the first US president under 40</a>.</p> <p>Harris made a flying start in January, drawing more than 22,000 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/27/kamala-harris-2020-campaign-oakland-rally-democrats\">a rally in Oakland</a> and raising a not-to-be-sneezed-at $12m in the first three months. Some dubbed her the \u201cfemale Obama\u201d and hoped she could rebuild the former president\u2019s coalition, which may be essential to beating Trump.</p> <p>But some observers argue that like other candidates of colour, Harris found herself subject to double standards. She was hammered for at first suggesting she supported abolishing private health insurance, then executing a U-turn and releasing a plan that preserved it.

In a parting shot at rivals Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, who are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/fe4ef751a4aeddb6ca5555e231fae7ce\">spending tens of millions of dollars</a> on TV ads, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not a billionaire. I can\u2019t fund my own campaign.

Allison added: \u201cRemember, we black women were never acknowledged as the backbone of anything until it was irrefutable that we delivered the victory two weeks before Christmas in the special election in Alabama, in the deep south, where the Republicans had dominated for 25 years.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s Republican party has leaned into white identity politics. Democrats elected the most diverse candidates yet in the 2018 midterms, including the first two Muslim women in Congress. Their presidential primary also broke new ground: last June it featured six women, six people of colour and an openly gay man. But the debate qualifying rules set by Tom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman who two years ago coined the \u201cbackbone\u201d claim, are said by critics to have disadvantaged candidates of colour by putting too much emphasis on access to financial support. So far only white aspirants have met the polling and donor thresholds to participate in the 19 December debate. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible look for the Democratic party,\u201d Allison said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a party that\u2019s half people of colour and 25% black. Women of colour are six times more likely to vote Democrat than a white guy. Women of colour are more likely to vote Democrat than white women because a majority of white women voted for Trump. \u201cSo we need a standard bearer for the Democratic party who speaks the language of solidarity, who\u2019s able to organise a multiracial coalition, and when you have an all-white stage you\u2019re missing lived experience, expertise and policy that helps to both inspire and speak to the very people we need to turn out to win in 2020. It\u2019s a terrifying prospect.\u201d Harris and Cory Booker, two African American senators, are both in their 50s and should be in their prime. Yet they have trailed three white septuagenarians \u2013 Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 as well as Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of a small city who would be the first US president under 40. Harris made a flying start in January, drawing more than 22,000 to a rally in Oakland and raising a not-to-be-sneezed-at $12m in the first three months. Some dubbed her the \u201cfemale Obama\u201d and hoped she could rebuild the former president\u2019s coalition, which may be essential to beating Trump. But some observers argue that like other candidates of colour, Harris found herself subject to double standards. She was hammered for at first suggesting she supported abolishing private health insurance, then executing a U-turn and releasing a plan that preserved it. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, performed arguably an even bigger reversal with considerably less blowback. Harris also came under fire over a June debate in which she upbraided frontrunner Biden over his past opposition to school desegregation busing with an anecdote about her own experience that culminated: \u201cThat little girl was me.\u201d Leah Greenberg, the co-executive director of the grassroots movement Indivisible, said: \u201cWhen there was a very memorable exchange between Harris and Biden, a lot of the readout was about how Joe Biden was very hurt that he had been personally criticised on the debate stage, which is a very odd direction to go in considering that it is a debate. \u201cWhen you look at things like the way that some of the post-debate spin has been covered, you definitely see some of the ways in which candidates of colour end up being received differently from white candidates.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m not a billionaire\u2019 Throwing in the towel, Harris explained to supporters that she had run out of cash. In a parting shot at rivals Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, who are spending tens of millions of dollars on TV ads, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not a billionaire. I can\u2019t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it\u2019s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete.\u201d It was a theme taken up by Booker, who pointed out that currently more billionaires than black people have qualified for this month\u2019s debate. \u201cIt is a problem when an immensely qualified, widely supported, truly accomplished black woman running to lead the party, a party that is significantly empowered by black women voters, didn\u2019t have the resources that she needed to continue here to Iowa,\u201d Booker said at a campaign event. \u201cWhat message is that sending that we heralded the most diverse field in our history, and now we\u2019re seeing people like her dropping out of this campaign \u2013 not because Iowa voters had the voice? Voters did not determine her destiny.\u201d People of colour, and women of colour in particular, face unique barriers to political fundraising and have to work harder to win over sceptical donors, Greenberg said. \u201cWe see across the board that people raise concerns about candidates who do not fit the mould of what they think of as an electable candidate and given the biases of our society, given the ways that power is structured, we\u2019re often thinking about electability in the mould of who\u2019s come before and that usually looks like a white guy with good hair and a lot of money. \u201cFundamentally, we\u2019ve seen that in races at every level, that really talented and really impressive candidates can struggle when people are trying to apply their own inner pundit lens and say, \u2018Are they electable?\u2019 rather than \u2018Am I excited about this candidate?\u2019\u201d The vicious circles include media commentary, second guessing whether a woman of colour is seen as a \u201cviable\u201d commander-in-chief, all but one of whom have been white men since 1789. LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said: \u201cI think America has the image of a president that is traditionally a white male. We have been trained in this patriarchal framework to think we are in a crisis with Trump and the only way to beat him is with another white male.\u201d Harris told New York magazine: \u201cAre there four words who would describe who I am? There\u2019s no frame of reference. Like, we have terms for that guy. He\u2019s the boy next door. That\u2019s your uncle, who\u2019s at the Thanksgiving dinner, who does this thing and that. There are images. The girl next door, there\u2019s an image for that, too.\u201d \u2018We should change who starts our primary\u2019 An additional factor is that the first caucus is held in Iowa and the first primary in New Hampshire, both overwhelmingly white states, skewering early polling and warping expectations. Candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro, a former US housing secretary who is Latino, has demanded reform. Coby Owens, a civil rights activist and candidate for city council in Wilmington, Delaware, said: \u201cWhite candidates are going to do better in polling in Iowa and New Hampshire. We should change who starts our primary, not only so it looks more like the Democratic party but more like America.\u201d In Harris\u2019s absence, the candidates who have qualified for the final debate of the year are Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders, Warren, Steyer and Amy Klobuchar \u2013 all of them white. Booker, Castro, Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang are still striving to make it. By contrast, a Republican debate in December 2015 included Ben Carson, who is African American, and the US senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, both Latino. Owens said: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge slap in the face to different demographics in the base of the party. It makes the Democratic party look weak if we\u2019re not utilising our diversity of different identities and ideologies. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a single vote cast yet so to exclude people is really going to handicap the party. The party is going back to its \u2018good ol\u2019 boys\u2019 era and I think it\u2019s going to hurt us in the long run.\u201d Greenberg summed up the feelings of many in a tweet. \u201cNo matter your candidate, you have to recognize that going from the most diverse field ever in January to a potentially all-white debate stage in December is catastrophic,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe implicit racism and sexism of \u2018electability\u2019 is deeply damaging to democracy.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Brexit party\u2019s decision to stand aside for the Tories in hundreds of seats curtailed the electoral ambitions of the Liberal Democrats, its leader Jo Swinson has said.</p> <p>In an interview with the <em>Observer</em>, Swinson said that her party\u2019s strategy had been affected by a \u201ccosy stitch-up\u201d that saw Nigel Farage\u2019s party stand down in Tory-held seats. She said the party was now concentrating on \u201cdozens of byelections across the country\u201d that could still deliver new Lib Dem MPs and topple some big-name Conservatives on election night. She also predicted that Johnson would be toppled as Tory leader should he fail to win a majority.</p> <p>Swinson\u2019s remarks come as concerns build within the Lib Dems over the party\u2019s prospects on polling day.

      "bodyText": "The Brexit party\u2019s decision to stand aside for the Tories in hundreds of seats curtailed the electoral ambitions of the Liberal Democrats, its leader Jo Swinson has said. In an interview with the Observer, Swinson said that her party\u2019s strategy had been affected by a \u201ccosy stitch-up\u201d that saw Nigel Farage\u2019s party stand down in Tory-held seats. She said the party was now concentrating on \u201cdozens of byelections across the country\u201d that could still deliver new Lib Dem MPs and topple some big-name Conservatives on election night. She also predicted that Johnson would be toppled as Tory leader should he fail to win a majority. Swinson\u2019s remarks come as concerns build within the Lib Dems over the party\u2019s prospects on polling day. Insiders were hoping in the summer that a major breakthrough could be possible, with well over 100 seats in play. \u201cWe had polling internally \u2013 but there was public polling as well \u2013 that showed that in a scenario where you have the Lib Dems, Labour, the Tories and the Brexit party all around 20% with a few of the other parties, then in a first-past-the-post system that can create a lot of volatility,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cosy stitch-up between Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson told us two things. It did make the electoral arithmetic much more difficult. The second thing is it shows quite how far Boris Johnson\u2019s party has moved to the extreme.

      "body": "<p>John Legend springs up from his mahogany grand piano in the high-ceilinged, light-drenched living room of his Hollywood home and greets me with a grin, a hello, and one of those very smooth handshakes that seamlessly morph into an extremely brief hug. My palms are sweaty and my face is flushed. Until a moment ago, I\u2019d been running up the road that leads to Legend\u2019s hilltop house, late because of the traffic. And now I\u2019m sweatily, awkwardly apologising to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/johnlegend\" title=\"\">John Legend</a> in his beautiful living room as he gestures towards another room where there\u2019s a long table by the window that overlooks the morning haze and the distant ridges of the Santa Monica mountains.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just zen out in this zen dining room,\u201d John Legend says, before looking around the room as if for the first time, running his hands over the dark-wood table, leaning back in his chair, lifting his head. He inhales, exhales, beams. And then he laughs \u2013 a long, deep, rich baritone. The laugh alone is like a song. And the traffic? What traffic? We are in Legend-land. Troubles are distant memories. </p> <p>Legend has this effect on almost everybody, and it has brought him great success. His debut album, 2004\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/dec/10/popandrock.shopping2\" title=\"\">Get Lifted</a></em>, sold 3m copies worldwide, and its single, Ordinary People, was so ubiquitous that for a solid chunk of the mid-aughts it was inescapable. His 2013 release, All of Me, written for the model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/09/trump-chrissy-teigen-john-legend-twitter-criminal-justice-reform\" title=\"\">Chrissy Teigen</a>, his then-fianc\u00e9e-now-wife, who he met on a music video shoot, has been played on Spotify more than 1bn times. Legend is still mainly a musician. He goes into the studio most days, and he has his seventh album coming out next year. But lately he\u2019s transformed into something more. He\u2019s on TV all the time, not just as a coach on <em>The Voice</em>, but subbing for Ellen DeGeneres on her show, and playing Jesus in a live on-air version of <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em>. It makes sense that Legend played Jesus: few entertainers are so broadly popular, and fewer still are the kind of politically engaged moral arbiter of our troubled times that he has become.</p> <p>And yet, despite (or because of) all of that, he has another effect, too. There is something about him, his family, his way of being in the world, that pisses certain people off. In September, Donald Trump tweeted at Legend (\u201cboring musician\u201d) and Teigen (\u201cfilthy mouthed wife\u201d) after the pair appeared at an event focused on criminal justice held at New York\u2019s notorious Sing Sing prison. Last month, after the release of Legend\u2019s Christmas album, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/14/john-legend-a-legendary-christmas-review-tasteful-covers-need-a-tot-of-sherry\" title=\"\">A Legendary Christmas</a></em>, a collection of originals and classic covers, Piers Morgan described him as \u201cHollywood\u2019s self-appointed Virtue-Signaller-in-Chief\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0216e931fe47715c67e55ef963e9d96f64517a6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0216e931fe47715c67e55ef963e9d96f64517a6d/0_492_828_497/500.jpg\" alt=\"Family man: John Legend in an Instagram post with his daughter Luna and wife Chrissy Teigen.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Family man: John Legend in an Instagram post with his daughter Luna and wife Chrissy Teigen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @johnlegend</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I mention how I\u2019d been listening to the album that morning. \u201cIt\u2019s a mood-enhancer,\u201d Legend says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re humming Christmas songs all summer, it\u2019s very therapeutic.\u201d Yet there is one song on the album that a lot of people found not very therapeutic at all, and that song is a cover of Baby It\u2019s Cold Outside. Legend has changed some of the song\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/29/baby-its-cold-outside-rewritten-by-john-legend-to-remove-date-rape-lyric\" title=\"\">lyrics</a> to be more modern and less \u2013 some would say \u2013 rapey.</p> <p>He knew there was controversy around the original: some radio stations had banned it last winter and it had been cancelled by various factions on the internet. But he thought that changing some lyrics to better reflect our more evolved era, where people are supposed to ask for consent, and include a few other fun modern flourishes, like a plotline featuring an impatient Uber driver named Murray, would be, well: \u201cIt would be fun, and it would be newsworthy. And \u2013 yeah \u2013 it was both.\u201d</p> <p>Legend is downplaying here. Ever since his version was released last month, people \u2013 from Morgan to Dean Martin\u2019s daughter \u2013 have lost their minds about it, exclaiming that the rewritten song is a travesty, an affront, a war on culture or the end of culture itself. This, to Legend, is absurd and exasperating. \u201cThe song was supposed to be silly!\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be preachy at all. I never disparaged the old version. And, by the way, the original writer, or his family, gets paid for my version, too.\u201d</p> <p>Normally, that would be the final word in that particular controversy. But Legend isn\u2019t done with it. He grows thoughtful and leans forward in his seat. He speaks now in a lower, nearly hushed tone. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d he says, \u201cthis whole backlash to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo</a> movement. People thinking we\u2019ve gone too far speaking up for a woman\u2019s right to not get raped or sexually harassed, when some would argue we\u2019ve not gone far enough, when we have an admitted sexual assailant in the highest office in the land. People think that because some people have lost their jobs, or have been expelled from Hollywood, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/harvey-weinstein\" title=\"\">Weinstein</a>, that we\u2019ve gone too far. I don\u2019t agree. But people wanted the Baby It\u2019s Cold Outside war to be a proxy war for all that.\u201d</p> <p>Weird, how that silly, funny song suddenly got very serious. It says a lot about where we are as a hyper-polarised, extremely online society in 2019. It also says quite a lot about who Legend is, not just as a politically engaged entertainer or as a hyper-talented youngest ever EGOT-getter (that\u2019s his Emmy and 10 Grammys and Oscar and Tony ); or as a father of two; or as a husband to the supermodel-slash-Queen of Twitter-slash-disarmingly honest lifestyle guru Teigen. No, the way to understand why it is that Legend can suddenly turn a silly song serious is that these are serious, fearful times. And the only way to match all the fear in our world is with a kind of radical, all encompassing love.</p> <p>But, first, give him a minute to explain what he means by love, exactly. To get there, you must first understand a criticism Legend receives, which is nicely summarised by Trump\u2019s tweet. Here\u2019s a popular singer, on TV, talking about criminal justice. What does he know? What right does he have?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b73adbb88d468e95304256e8e3c0eec05977624\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b73adbb88d468e95304256e8e3c0eec05977624/46_324_2666_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Legend on the Kelly Clarkson show with a screen behind the guests showing the People front, picturing him with the banner \u2018sexiest man alive\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man of the people: on the Kelly Clarkson show as the \u2018sexiest man alive\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The thing is, Legend has been involved in prison reform for years. Also: education, poverty, HIV/Aids, disaster relief, food security, drug policy, childcare, military aid\u2026 People look at Legend, see all this do-gooder activism, and think to themselves: he can\u2019t be for real, he can\u2019t <em>mean</em> all this. Isn\u2019t this just so much virtue signalling?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what virtue signalling is supposed to be,\u201d he says. \u201cI get that people don\u2019t like people who are overly preachy or overly moralising. But, in my humble opinion, if you care about people who are often undervalued and overlooked in society, what\u2019s so negative about that? There seem to be some who think that standing up for immigrants whose kids are getting locked up in cages is\u2026 some might call that virtue signalling and some might think speaking up against it is absolutely right.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a certainty to what he says and the way he says it that is absolutely correct and totally annoying. That\u2019s the thing with people who have such a firm grip on their moral compass: they shame the rest of us. Legend is <em>good</em>. While the rest of us are just trying to catch our breath, flushed and sweaty and jittery. But then he reaches out a hand for a shake and pulls you right in and soothes you. Maybe you recoil. Or maybe you just give in.</p> <p><em><strong>Fifteen years ago,</strong></em> I saw Legend on stage for the first time, belting out the backups and choruses at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\" title=\"\">Kanye West</a> concert, already clearly en route to becoming a star. A year earlier he had been performing under his given name, John Stephens, in tiny jazz clubs throughout Philadelphia and New York as he worked a day job at the Boston Consulting Group. Then he and Kanye met, Kanye gave him the name Legend, and the rest, as they say, is history. But what is most striking about Legend back then versus Legend now is that the two people \u2013 John Legend and John Stephens \u2013 seem one and the same.</p> <p>Legend remembers that night as if it was yesterday, correcting me on some details, describing it as \u201cthe beginning\u201d. I ask him about his and Kanye\u2019s divergent paths, both artistically and politically, and offer up a theory I heard from another Kanye collaborator: that Kanye\u2019s core beliefs in music and art and politics and everything, all of it, stems from the relentless pursuit of freedom. His quest for freedom is what led him to fashion, to Jesus, to supporting Trump.</p> <p>Legend agrees. \u201cHe wants to do what he thinks is the boldest, most unexpected and free thing,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously I vehemently disagreed with the turn it took when it came to Trump, but I think that\u2019s a common thread when it comes to the creative and life choices he\u2019s made.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"385d10bc344a92a6db0db6a745e0effd8bc91819\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/385d10bc344a92a6db0db6a745e0effd8bc91819/0_105_2278_1367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I vehemently disagreed with the turn it took when it came to Trump\u2019: with former collaborator Kanye West.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I vehemently disagreed with the turn it took when it came to Trump\u2019: with former collaborator Kanye West.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Polk/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does Legend have a core belief like that? Something that can be summed up in a word? \u201cI think, yes, I do,\u201d he says. \u201cI think about love.\u201d He takes a beat. \u201cLove as a public virtue.\u201d He shifts in his seat now, getting serious again. \u201cLove in public is what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/cornel-west\" title=\"\">Cornel West</a> called justice, the idea that you value people\u2019s lives no matter who they are or where they live or how different they are from you. All the differences we have, if you have the ability to love your neighbour, or not just your neighbour but \u2013 in church they defined neighbour as broadly as possible. And so I feel like \u2013 and I don\u2019t always get it right \u2013 it\u2019s that we should love our neighbour, which is everyone, as we love ourselves.\u201d This is a radical thing, a radical love. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to do.\u201d</p> <p>Legend has talked about this philosophy before, in a 2014 graduation speech he delivered at the University of Pennsylvania, his alma mater. \u201cThe key to success, the key to happiness, is opening your mind and your heart to love,\u201d he told the graduates. He went on to tell the story of his upbringing in Springfield, Ohio \u2013 a small, blue-collar city where he was surrounded by family: four siblings and two parents \u201cwho cared so much about our education that they home-schooled us for several years during grade school.\u201d</p> <p>His parents took in foster kids, helped the homeless, and were, Legend says, \u201clike a model family in our church and local community.\u201d But when Legend was 10, things fell apart. His grandmother died and his mother fell into a depression that would tear the family apart. His parents eventually divorced. His mother disappeared from his life for more than a decade, addicted to drugs and sinking ever further into depression. \u201cMy world was shattered,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He coped by deciding that \u201cif I didn\u2019t fall in love, no one could ever betray me like that again.\u201d The only thing he allowed himself to love fully and without reservation was music and it was this love that gave him his career, the success and the money and the beautiful zen dining room with a view of the mountains. More than all of that, the love gave him the ability to forgive his mother. It was the love that gives him daily the capacity to take a deep breath and cooly and with great strength and certainty dive into the fray, haters be damned.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you actually care about something, you want to lead. Apathy\u2019s not so cool any more,\u201d he told the graduates. Which is another way of explaining why, even when talking about a silly old Christmas song and its modern rewrite, things can quickly turn so serious. It\u2019s love.</p> <p>This core philosophy resides most fully in his life here at home. If you follow either Legend or, especially, Teigen on social media, you already have quite a good sense of what this life looks like. Even stepping into their home is like entering a bizarre world you\u2019ve seen online and in magazine spreads. There\u2019s no facade. There\u2019s no mask.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d000141e57c39778ee3309d60a933b1bbfca174\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d000141e57c39778ee3309d60a933b1bbfca174/0_344_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Legend as a judge on America\u2019s The Voice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">TV judge: on America\u2019s The Voice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Legend wakes up at 6.30am, hangs out with his kids, works out, takes the kids to preschool (Luna, three) and music class (Miles, one), goes to the studio around noon, works until dinner, comes home, tucks the kids into bed. \u201cThen I sit at home with Chrissy and watch reality shows and drink wine and live to face another day.\u201d On Sundays he watches a lot of American football. He\u2019s pretty sure the only surprise people would have about his life is that he rarely hangs out with other celebrities.</p> <p>There\u2019s something radical in this, too \u2013 this normal, good, loving life lived openly and transparently. When we\u2019re talking about his Christmas album, Legend mentions one of his biggest musical influences and in many ways the model for his career: the great jazz pianist and singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/12/nat-king-cole-attacked-on-stage-archive-1956\" title=\"\">Nat King Cole</a>. Legend covers Cole\u2019s immortal Christmas Song on the album, but the influence goes far beyond just vocal stylings and keyboard chops. Cole was a trailblazer, the first black man ever to host a variety show on TV.</p> <p>He might not have been as outspoken as Legend, but to see him as apolitical is to read him, and history, wrong. The racism he faced as one of the most popular entertainers in America was relentless and horrific. When he moved his family into a wealthy all-white neighbourhood in Los Angeles in 1948, the neighbours burned the N-word in his lawn and killed his dog. His show was cancelled after a year because no major sponsor wanted to touch it. \u201cNat King Cole\u2019s very existence was controversial,\u201d Legend says.</p> <p>There is no escaping the fact that Legend\u2019s existence, this life he is leading so happily and openly and successfully, is controversial to certain groups of people, too. Controversial is possibly too nice a word for it. Nobody is more aware of this uneasy truth than Legend himself. He reads his Twitter mentions. He is reminded daily, in the messages he receives online, of the haters, the racists, the bile spewed towards him and his family.</p> <p>Even today, on this nice zenned-out morning, he is bracing for the onslaught. Later on, he will be named <em><a href=\"https://people.com/tag/sexiest-man-alive/\" title=\"\">People</a></em><a href=\"https://people.com/tag/sexiest-man-alive/\" title=\"\">\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive</a>. He says this offhandedly, like, can you believe it? I ask him if he\u2019s happy about it and he says he is, but he immediately adds that, truly, \u201cthis is a double- edged sword\u201d. For the next several weeks he\u2019ll be hearing all about all the other, sexier men who deserved the title more than he. And that is honestly sort of funny, but there\u2019s a more sinister edge to it that he would rather not think about. All the gross hate that bubbles up when he triumphs in just about anything. \u201cMaybe this is a day I don\u2019t check my mentions,\u201d he says.</p> <p>And yet, he goes on. \u201cI see what\u2019s happening and I feel compelled to say something. I could choose not to wade into these controversies. I realise it comes at some risk. But I just\u2026\u201d He stops. For the first time in our conversation it feels as if the flow has been interrupted, like he\u2019s searching for the right word. \u201cI just feel like \u2013 I can\u2019t not.\u201d He laughs at himself, at the honesty betrayed by the inarticulate phrase. He\u2019s right, of course. Not an hour after I leave that morning, just a few hours before he\u2019s officially crowned Sexiest Man Alive, he\u2019s tweeting about White House senior advisor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/24/stephen-miller-white-nationalist-trump-immigration-guru\" title=\"\">Stephen Miller</a>\u2019s recently uncovered racist emails. Of course he would be. He can\u2019t not.</p> <p><em>John Legend\u2019s album A Legendary Christmas is out now</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "John Legend springs up from his mahogany grand piano in the high-ceilinged, light-drenched living room of his Hollywood home and greets me with a grin, a hello, and one of those very smooth handshakes that seamlessly morph into an extremely brief hug. My palms are sweaty and my face is flushed. Until a moment ago, I\u2019d been running up the road that leads to Legend\u2019s hilltop house, late because of the traffic. And now I\u2019m sweatily, awkwardly apologising to John Legend in his beautiful living room as he gestures towards another room where there\u2019s a long table by the window that overlooks the morning haze and the distant ridges of the Santa Monica mountains. \u201cLet\u2019s just zen out in this zen dining room,\u201d John Legend says, before looking around the room as if for the first time, running his hands over the dark-wood table, leaning back in his chair, lifting his head. He inhales, exhales, beams. And then he laughs \u2013 a long, deep, rich baritone. The laugh alone is like a song. And the traffic? What traffic? We are in Legend-land. Troubles are distant memories. Legend has this effect on almost everybody, and it has brought him great success. His debut album, 2004\u2019s Get Lifted, sold 3m copies worldwide, and its single, Ordinary People, was so ubiquitous that for a solid chunk of the mid-aughts it was inescapable. His 2013 release, All of Me, written for the model Chrissy Teigen, his then-fianc\u00e9e-now-wife, who he met on a music video shoot, has been played on Spotify more than 1bn times. Legend is still mainly a musician. He goes into the studio most days, and he has his seventh album coming out next year. But lately he\u2019s transformed into something more. He\u2019s on TV all the time, not just as a coach on The Voice, but subbing for Ellen DeGeneres on her show, and playing Jesus in a live on-air version of Jesus Christ Superstar. It makes sense that Legend played Jesus: few entertainers are so broadly popular, and fewer still are the kind of politically engaged moral arbiter of our troubled times that he has become. And yet, despite (or because of) all of that, he has another effect, too. There is something about him, his family, his way of being in the world, that pisses certain people off. In September, Donald Trump tweeted at Legend (\u201cboring musician\u201d) and Teigen (\u201cfilthy mouthed wife\u201d) after the pair appeared at an event focused on criminal justice held at New York\u2019s notorious Sing Sing prison. Last month, after the release of Legend\u2019s Christmas album, A Legendary Christmas, a collection of originals and classic covers, Piers Morgan described him as \u201cHollywood\u2019s self-appointed Virtue-Signaller-in-Chief\u201d. I mention how I\u2019d been listening to the album that morning. \u201cIt\u2019s a mood-enhancer,\u201d Legend says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re humming Christmas songs all summer, it\u2019s very therapeutic.\u201d Yet there is one song on the album that a lot of people found not very therapeutic at all, and that song is a cover of Baby It\u2019s Cold Outside. Legend has changed some of the song\u2019s lyrics to be more modern and less \u2013 some would say \u2013 rapey. He knew there was controversy around the original: some radio stations had banned it last winter and it had been cancelled by various factions on the internet. But he thought that changing some lyrics to better reflect our more evolved era, where people are supposed to ask for consent, and include a few other fun modern flourishes, like a plotline featuring an impatient Uber driver named Murray, would be, well: \u201cIt would be fun, and it would be newsworthy. And \u2013 yeah \u2013 it was both.\u201d Legend is downplaying here. Ever since his version was released last month, people \u2013 from Morgan to Dean Martin\u2019s daughter \u2013 have lost their minds about it, exclaiming that the rewritten song is a travesty, an affront, a war on culture or the end of culture itself. This, to Legend, is absurd and exasperating. \u201cThe song was supposed to be silly!\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be preachy at all. I never disparaged the old version. And, by the way, the original writer, or his family, gets paid for my version, too.\u201d Normally, that would be the final word in that particular controversy. But Legend isn\u2019t done with it. He grows thoughtful and leans forward in his seat. He speaks now in a lower, nearly hushed tone. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d he says, \u201cthis whole backlash to the #MeToo movement. People thinking we\u2019ve gone too far speaking up for a woman\u2019s right to not get raped or sexually harassed, when some would argue we\u2019ve not gone far enough, when we have an admitted sexual assailant in the highest office in the land. People think that because some people have lost their jobs, or have been expelled from Hollywood, like Weinstein, that we\u2019ve gone too far. I don\u2019t agree. But people wanted the Baby It\u2019s Cold Outside war to be a proxy war for all that.\u201d Weird, how that silly, funny song suddenly got very serious. It says a lot about where we are as a hyper-polarised, extremely online society in 2019. It also says quite a lot about who Legend is, not just as a politically engaged entertainer or as a hyper-talented youngest ever EGOT-getter (that\u2019s his Emmy and 10 Grammys and Oscar and Tony ); or as a father of two; or as a husband to the supermodel-slash-Queen of Twitter-slash-disarmingly honest lifestyle guru Teigen. No, the way to understand why it is that Legend can suddenly turn a silly song serious is that these are serious, fearful times.

He\u2019s pretty sure the only surprise people would have about his life is that he rarely hangs out with other celebrities. There\u2019s something radical in this, too \u2013 this normal, good, loving life lived openly and transparently. When we\u2019re talking about his Christmas album, Legend mentions one of his biggest musical influences and in many ways the model for his career: the great jazz pianist and singer Nat King Cole. Legend covers Cole\u2019s immortal Christmas Song on the album, but the influence goes far beyond just vocal stylings and keyboard chops. Cole was a trailblazer, the first black man ever to host a variety show on TV. He might not have been as outspoken as Legend, but to see him as apolitical is to read him, and history, wrong. The racism he faced as one of the most popular entertainers in America was relentless and horrific. When he moved his family into a wealthy all-white neighbourhood in Los Angeles in 1948, the neighbours burned the N-word in his lawn and killed his dog. His show was cancelled after a year because no major sponsor wanted to touch it. \u201cNat King Cole\u2019s very existence was controversial,\u201d Legend says. There is no escaping the fact that Legend\u2019s existence, this life he is leading so happily and openly and successfully, is controversial to certain groups of people, too. Controversial is possibly too nice a word for it. Nobody is more aware of this uneasy truth than Legend himself. He reads his Twitter mentions. He is reminded daily, in the messages he receives online, of the haters, the racists, the bile spewed towards him and his family. Even today, on this nice zenned-out morning, he is bracing for the onslaught. Later on, he will be named People\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive. He says this offhandedly, like, can you believe it? I ask him if he\u2019s happy about it and he says he is, but he immediately adds that, truly, \u201cthis is a double- edged sword\u201d. For the next several weeks he\u2019ll be hearing all about all the other, sexier men who deserved the title more than he. And that is honestly sort of funny, but there\u2019s a more sinister edge to it that he would rather not think about. All the gross hate that bubbles up when he triumphs in just about anything. \u201cMaybe this is a day I don\u2019t check my mentions,\u201d he says. And yet, he goes on. \u201cI see what\u2019s happening and I feel compelled to say something. I could choose not to wade into these controversies. I realise it comes at some risk. But I just\u2026\u201d He stops. For the first time in our conversation it feels as if the flow has been interrupted, like he\u2019s searching for the right word. \u201cI just feel like \u2013 I can\u2019t not.\u201d He laughs at himself, at the honesty betrayed by the inarticulate phrase. He\u2019s right, of course. Not an hour after I leave that morning, just a few hours before he\u2019s officially crowned Sexiest Man Alive, he\u2019s tweeting about White House senior advisor Stephen Miller\u2019s recently uncovered racist emails. Of course he would be. He can\u2019t not. John Legend\u2019s album A Legendary Christmas is out now",

In 2007 it spent $5.7m, then $10.4m in 2009 and $17.5m in 2010 That year, the Citizens United supreme court ruling removed many restrictions on corporate cash, making it possible for the Kochs and their allies to purchase the climate position of Congress. After the House passed a comprehensive carbon control measure at the beginning of the Obama administration, the Kochs made sure it died in the Senate. Because the Kochs are nothing if not thorough, they did the same on the state level, lobbying legislatures to eliminate incentives for renewable fuels. This ensured constant growth in the huge family fortune. Leonard writes: \u201cDuring the Obama years \u2013 the years when Americans for Prosperity warned repeatedly about the threat of creeping socialism \u2013 Charles and David Koch\u2019s fortune more than doubled once again. At the end of the Obama administration, Charles Koch was worth $42bn. Together, Charles and David were worth $84bn, a fortune larger than Bill Gates\u2019.\u201d Kochland makes it abundantly clear that everything that has been great for Koch industries has been catastrophic for America. And yet Leonard seems oddly ambivalent. After spending hundreds of pages describing horrors inflicted on the environment and the body politic, Leonard tells us Charles Koch is finally finding \u201ca sense of contentment\u201d through a new book project. His close friend Leslie Rudd tells us: \u201cI think Charles is doing just exactly what he wants to do, which is trying to do good.\u201d Leonard concludes that Koch will show his \u201cmarket-based management\u201d philosophy was not just a guidebook for operating companies, \u201cbut for operating entire societies. The proper shape of American society was the shape of Kochland.\u201d This is a very strange way to end a book about the wholesale pollution of land, air and water and the evisceration of American democracy.",

      "bodyText": "Firefighters have taken advantage of less extreme conditions to try to contain blazes burning across New South Wales ahead of worsening conditions and soaring temperatures expected on Tuesday. More than 100 fires were still burning across NSW on Sunday, including the massive Gospers Mountain blaze, which is expected to burn for weeks. Meanwhile, on Kangaroo Island, a bushfire burning at Newland was also posing a threat to lives. Amid the ongoing bushfire crisis, which has claimed six lives and more than 1,000 homes, the federal opposition restated its call for an emergency Council of Australian Governments meeting to discuss a national response to the bushfire emergency. Conditions eased on Sunday as a result of slackening winds and more moisture in the air, which allowed fire crews to conduct backburning before conditions deteriorate again. Monday will bring very high fire danger for parts of the state as temperatures build again toward heatwave conditions the Bureau of Meteorology (Bom) has forecast for Tuesday. Victoria has also declared a total fire ban for some parts of the state on Monday ahead of very high temperatures and strong winds. In Queensland, conditions also eased on Sunday morning but were flaring again by the afternoon. A prepare to leave warning was issued for the West Kinkuna/Goodwood bushfire on Sunday afternoon. On Tuesday, a number of districts in southern and central NSW \u2013 including the Greater Hunter, the southern and central ranges, and the Illawarra and Shoalhaven regions \u2013 are expected to experience severe fire danger. Temperatures in some parts of the state, including western Sydney, will soar into the 40s. The Bom said some inland areas, such as Bathurst and Orange, could see record temperatures for December. \u201cIt looks likely we\u2019ll see the next big peak day on Tuesday, with a number of districts likely to experience severe fire danger,\u201d Bom meteorologist Diana Eadie said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see another wind change move across the area, we\u2019ll see winds ahead of that change strengthening in combination with very warm temperatures and dry conditions.\u201d Eadie said that because the fires across the state were now so large, severe conditions of the kind expected on Tuesday could intensify the situation. By Wednesday and Thursday, she said, the focus would shift again to north-eastern parts of NSW where fires have been burning for weeks. She said westerly winds could also again increase the smoke haze around areas such as Sydney later in the week. The NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, told Seven News that crews working to contain fires on Sunday had been dealing with \u201cmore benign\u201d conditions across most of the fire grounds compared with previous days. \u201cWhich means hundreds \u2013 as a matter of fact more than 1,600 \u2013 firefighters are around again today doing really important and critical backburning and containment line consolidation to try and gain the upper hand before we see those conditions deteriorate into Tuesday.\u201d However, despite the easing conditions, many firefighters were still up against hard-to-control blazes, including the Green Wattle Creek blaze, south-west of Sydney. Victoria\u2019s Mallee, Wimmera and Northern Country districts will be under a total fire ban on Monday, with very high to severe fire danger expected. Gusts of up to 70km/h are also forecast for the north-west, with an expected high of 43C in Mildura and 42C in Swan Hill. Melbourne is forecast to reach a top of 39C. In Queensland, a high fire danger rating was in place on Sunday for the Darling Downs and Granite Belt to Cape York Peninsula, and severe fire danger was forecast for the Northern Goldfields and Upper Flinders on Monday. Late on Sunday the Kangaroo Island blaze at Harriet Road was uncontrolled while burning under severe weather conditions.

His Brexit withdrawal agreement paves the way for, at best, a bare-bones free trade relationship with the EU that would necessitate a customs border in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/16/the-irish-sea-border-what-does-it-mean-for-businesses-brexit\" title=\"\">Irish Sea</a> and would impose more of the same economic pain Britain has suffered through a decade of austerity, while turning us into a rule taker. It is the culmination of the hard Eurosceptic right\u2019s ascendancy within the Tory party. A vote for Johnson is a vote for its vision of Britain: a low-tax, low-regulation state in which worker and consumer rights are sacrificed in the name of corporate profit.</p> <p>At the heart of Johnson\u2019s appeal is the myth that a vote for the Conservatives is a vote to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, as if our exit would not be followed by long and tortuous negotiations about the final relationship. But the worst of it lies in the casual indifference a prime minister has shown to a peace process that ended decades of bloody conflict in Northern Ireland. The Stormont assembly chamber has sat vacant for years, putting the principle of governing by cross-community consent in grave jeopardy. That Johnson would endanger it further by imposing a customs border on Northern Ireland in order to enhance his re-election prospects is reprehensible.</p> <p>Reprehensible, but perhaps unsurprising, given his record. Long happy to deploy racist stereotypes and dogwhistles when he has judged them to benefit his career, he shrugs them off under questioning as irrelevant relics from the past. His hypocrisy is breathtaking: compare his vile comments on single mothers with his evasiveness about whether he takes parental responsibility for the child he fathered while married to someone else. His rank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jun/30/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-richard-ratcliffe-boris-johnson-gaffes\" title=\"\">incompetence</a> at the Foreign Office has had tragic consequences for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who languishes in an Iranian jail.</p> <h2>Evading democratic scrutiny<br></h2> <p>Johnson has defined his campaign by running against the record of a government of which he was part; a government that delivered billions in tax cuts for more affluent families while cutting tax credits to support children living in poverty; that starved schools and hospitals of the resources they needed, with little thought for the young and the seriously ill. The Tory manifesto stops far short of reversing the cuts of the last decade, despite what Johnson would have us believe: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/29/from-40-hospitals-to-six-tories-nhs-numbers-dont-add-up\" title=\"\">he lied</a> about the number of extra hospitals a Conservative government would fund and misled voters about the number of extra nurses it would train.</p> <p>The Conservatives have also fabricated figures about the cost of Labour\u2019s policies. While Labour has also put out misleading numbers, it was joining a race to the bottom initiated by the Conservatives. Johnson has thought nothing of refusing to subject himself to the scrutiny of set-piece interviews the other leaders have faced. But perhaps the lowest moment of the campaign was Johnson\u2019s disgraceful politicisation of a terrorist attack, deliberately deploying inaccuracies in order to blame Labour.</p> <p>This is the sort of campaign we could expect from a man who has gone to such lengths to evade democratic scrutiny. He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/24/johnson-avoiding-scrutiny-cancelled-appearances-says-senior-mp\" title=\"\">cancelled numerous appearances</a> before parliament\u2019s liaison committee and unlawfully tried to shut down parliament. MPs had to force Johnson to comply with the will of parliament by passing the Benn act. The Conservative manifesto threatens to strengthen the executive in relation to parliament and the courts, risking fresh disruption to our constitutional principle of parliamentary sovereignty.</p> <h2>Corbyn\u2019s disgraceful antisemitism crisis<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe3d1bc05ade851720f4232319deb441ef3b9277\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe3d1bc05ade851720f4232319deb441ef3b9277/434_82_2414_1449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn: \u2018His tenure as Labour leader has been mired in factionalism and division.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vickie Flores/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite a poor campaign centred around a widely unpopular pledge to revoke article 50 without a second referendum, the Liberal Democrats have started the painful process of recovery from their disastrous spell in coalition government. They have strong policies in particular on the critical issue of the climate crisis. But our first-past-the-post electoral system is unforgiving. In our two-party democracy, ejecting Johnson from Downing Street almost certainly means Jeremy Corbyn will become prime minister.</p> <p>We have made no secret of our reservations about his character and capacity to lead Britain. His tenure as Labour leader has been mired in factionalism and division. His re-energising of Labour\u2019s membership has not been matched by his capacity to inspire the wider electorate. Opinion polls rank him the <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/jeremy-corbyn/news/106687/jeremy-corbyn-most-unpopular\" title=\"\">most unpopular</a> opposition leader for decades. He has abdicated leadership by not being straightforward about an obvious truth \u2013 that Brexit would make delivering Labour\u2019s agenda for Britain so much harder. But the party is at least in favour of a confirmatory referendum on our place in Europe; in many constituencies, a vote for Labour is the best chance of delivering such an outcome. The <em>Observer</em> has expressed reservations about aspects of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/28/ifs-manifesto-verdict-neither-tories-nor-labour-have-credible-spending-plan\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s manifesto</a>: we cannot understand why it prioritises the needs of affluent pensioners over children living in poverty; we are concerned about its faith that any nationalised industry or service run by the state will be unfailingly excellent; we do not believe that the cost of restoring first-class public services and a humane welfare state can be met solely by the wealthiest 5%. But there is no question that Labour\u2019s manifesto envisages a kinder, greener, fairer Britain and that there is much within it that deserves our support.</p> <p>But Labour\u2019s gravest failing lies in the way Corbyn has handled the antisemitism crisis in his own party. Over three years, evidence has mounted of the institutional antisemitism, as defined by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/institutional-racism-britain-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-20-years\" title=\"\">Macpherson inquiry,</a> that afflicts the party from the top down. The Jewish Labour Movement\u2019s leaked submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) includes sworn statements from more than 70 former staff members and details a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/seventy-labour-staffers-give-statements-to-antisemitism-inquiry\" title=\"\">horrifying allegations</a>, including interference in the disciplinary process by Corbyn\u2019s office. Corbyn himself has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43523445\" title=\"\">questioned the removal of an antisemitic mural</a> and Jewish MPs have been bullied out of the party. During this campaign, Corbyn has made assertions about Labour\u2019s processes that leaked documents appear to contradict. Corbyn has displayed a staggering lack of contrition or empathy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5757f6e80aaa645e3a7c2852c7f0d7d159ba314\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5757f6e80aaa645e3a7c2852c7f0d7d159ba314/0_128_2098_1259/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Swinson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo Swinson: \u2018The Liberal Democrats have started the painful process of recovery from their disastrous spell in coalition government.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A chance to strip power from a charlatan<br></h2> <p>Labour is, of course, not the only party to face the charge of institutional racism. There has been far less scrutiny of the misleading statements from Johnson and his ministers that the Conservative party takes a \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach to Islamophobia. On the contrary, four ministers have gone campaigning with candidates facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/06/tory-ministers-back-candidates-accused-of-islamophobia\" title=\"\">accusations</a> of Islamophobia. Conservative councillors suspended for posting Islamophobic content have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/24/tory-islamophobia-row-15-suspended-councillors-quietly-reinstated\" title=\"\">quietly reinstated</a>, sometimes days later. Nearly half of Conservative members say they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/24/tory-members-would-not-want-muslim-prime-minister-islamophobia-survey\" title=\"\">do not want a Muslim</a> prime minister. The EHRC is in the process of <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/fresh-calls-equalities-watchdog-launch-islamophobia-inquiry-tory-party-11207328/\" title=\"\">assessing</a> whether to launch an official investigation into the party on the basis of the available evidence. The Conservative government\u2019s track record of racist policies speaks for itself, from the shocking deportation of members of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/16/windrush-era-citizens-row-timeline-of-key-events\" title=\"\">Windrush generation</a>, who had lived legally in Britain for decades, to its \u201cright to rent\u201d policy that was ruled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/03/the-observer-view-on-the-uk-right-to-rent-shame\" title=\"\">racially discriminatory</a> by the high court.</p> <p>It is disgraceful that more than 40 years after the Race Relations Act, both main parties are stained by charges of institutional racism. Many of our readers will be grappling with their consciences about voting for Labour. This is a sign that they take racism seriously, not that they care little about child poverty and homelessness.</p> <p>Our political honour code is breaking down. This post-truth election is a taster of what could be to come; Johnson would take us further into the abyss. That is why he has succeeded in achieving the extraordinary: uniting a former Conservative prime minister, John Major, with his Labour successor, Tony Blair, in a call to voters<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-general-election-campaign-john-major-conservatives-vote-a9235436.html\" title=\"\"> to turf him out</a>.</p> <p>On Thursday voters have the chance to strip power from a dangerous charlatan. We abhor Corbyn\u2019s failures on antisemitism; we recall Lib Dem complicity in the dreadful policies of the coalition government; we are no allies of the cause of Scottish and Welsh independence. But we urge our readers to exercise their judgment and, as their conscience allows, vote for the pro-referendum, progressive candidate most likely to deny Johnson the opportunity to wreak existential damage on our country.</p>",

But perhaps the lowest moment of the campaign was Johnson\u2019s disgraceful politicisation of a terrorist attack, deliberately deploying inaccuracies in order to blame Labour. This is the sort of campaign we could expect from a man who has gone to such lengths to evade democratic scrutiny. He has cancelled numerous appearances before parliament\u2019s liaison committee and unlawfully tried to shut down parliament. MPs had to force Johnson to comply with the will of parliament by passing the Benn act. The Conservative manifesto threatens to strengthen the executive in relation to parliament and the courts, risking fresh disruption to our constitutional principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Corbyn\u2019s disgraceful antisemitism crisis Despite a poor campaign centred around a widely unpopular pledge to revoke article 50 without a second referendum, the Liberal Democrats have started the painful process of recovery from their disastrous spell in coalition government. They have strong policies in particular on the critical issue of the climate crisis. But our first-past-the-post electoral system is unforgiving. In our two-party democracy, ejecting Johnson from Downing Street almost certainly means Jeremy Corbyn will become prime minister. We have made no secret of our reservations about his character and capacity to lead Britain. His tenure as Labour leader has been mired in factionalism and division. His re-energising of Labour\u2019s membership has not been matched by his capacity to inspire the wider electorate. Opinion polls rank him the most unpopular opposition leader for decades. He has abdicated leadership by not being straightforward about an obvious truth \u2013 that Brexit would make delivering Labour\u2019s agenda for Britain so much harder. But the party is at least in favour of a confirmatory referendum on our place in Europe; in many constituencies, a vote for Labour is the best chance of delivering such an outcome. The Observer has expressed reservations about aspects of Labour\u2019s manifesto: we cannot understand why it prioritises the needs of affluent pensioners over children living in poverty; we are concerned about its faith that any nationalised industry or service run by the state will be unfailingly excellent; we do not believe that the cost of restoring first-class public services and a humane welfare state can be met solely by the wealthiest 5%. But there is no question that Labour\u2019s manifesto envisages a kinder, greener, fairer Britain and that there is much within it that deserves our support. But Labour\u2019s gravest failing lies in the way Corbyn has handled the antisemitism crisis in his own party. Over three years, evidence has mounted of the institutional antisemitism, as defined by the Macpherson inquiry, that afflicts the party from the top down. The Jewish Labour Movement\u2019s leaked submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) includes sworn statements from more than 70 former staff members and details a series of horrifying allegations, including interference in the disciplinary process by Corbyn\u2019s office. Corbyn himself has questioned the removal of an antisemitic mural and Jewish MPs have been bullied out of the party. During this campaign, Corbyn has made assertions about Labour\u2019s processes that leaked documents appear to contradict. Corbyn has displayed a staggering lack of contrition or empathy. A chance to strip power from a charlatan Labour is, of course, not the only party to face the charge of institutional racism. There has been far less scrutiny of the misleading statements from Johnson and his ministers that the Conservative party takes a \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach to Islamophobia. On the contrary, four ministers have gone campaigning with candidates facing accusations of Islamophobia. Conservative councillors suspended for posting Islamophobic content have been quietly reinstated, sometimes days later. Nearly half of Conservative members say they do not want a Muslim prime minister. The EHRC is in the process of assessing whether to launch an official investigation into the party on the basis of the available evidence. The Conservative government\u2019s track record of racist policies speaks for itself, from the shocking deportation of members of the Windrush generation, who had lived legally in Britain for decades, to its \u201cright to rent\u201d policy that was ruled racially discriminatory by the high court. It is disgraceful that more than 40 years after the Race Relations Act, both main parties are stained by charges of institutional racism. Many of our readers will be grappling with their consciences about voting for Labour. This is a sign that they take racism seriously, not that they care little about child poverty and homelessness. Our political honour code is breaking down. This post-truth election is a taster of what could be to come; Johnson would take us further into the abyss. That is why he has succeeded in achieving the extraordinary: uniting a former Conservative prime minister, John Major, with his Labour successor, Tony Blair, in a call to voters to turf him out. On Thursday voters have the chance to strip power from a dangerous charlatan. We abhor Corbyn\u2019s failures on antisemitism; we recall Lib Dem complicity in the dreadful policies of the coalition government; we are no allies of the cause of Scottish and Welsh independence. But we urge our readers to exercise their judgment and, as their conscience allows, vote for the pro-referendum, progressive candidate most likely to deny Johnson the opportunity to wreak existential damage on our country.",

Gluing, trapping, netting, poisoning and shooting of birds are endemic throughout the Mediterranean region. While your report focuses on France, where half a million birds are killed annually, <a href=\"https://www.birdlife.org/sites/default/files/attachments/BL_ReportENG_V11_spreads.pdf\" title=\"\">Birdlife International </a>reports that Italy kills 5.6m a year, Cyprus 2.3m.

This breathtaking lack of respect, time or ceremony afforded to mothers, babies and midwives is a direct result of the maternity tariff, which is too low. As a consequence, all maternity hospitals and units are unviable, which explains why clinical commissioning groups are so keen to shut/reduce maternity units. Chief midwives and obstetricians have long campaigned for the tariff to be raised but their voices are not heeded.There are too many episodes involved in comprehensive maternity care and the commissioning number-crunchers have responded with a system that sets targets on time and bed occupancy regardless of long-term consequences. A healthy and confident mother determines the health and wellbeing of the family. It is the foundation stone of our nation\u2019s health. The inadequate maternity tariff fundamentally undermines this.<br><strong>Penny Griffiths</strong><br>Winkleigh, Devon<br></p> <h2>Plymouth comes up trumps<br></h2> <p>Plymouth is fortunate to be the focal point for celebrations surrounding the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower\u2019s journey to America.

None of the \u201cpilgrims\u201d came from the region, neither did the ship or its captain. And it\u2019s arguable whether the ship can be said to have set sail from there.</p> <p>In July 1620, the Speedwell sailed from the Dutch port of Delfshaven carrying 35 members of the English Separatist church, originally from the East Midlands. They had fled England in 1608 to escape imprisonment for their beliefs. Now they were on their way to America. At the same time, the Mayflower set sail from London with 67 merchant adventurers on board, heading for Southampton and a rendezvous with the Speedwell. The two ships were to sail in tandem to the New World. But the Speedwell was taking on water and had to put in for repairs in Plymouth. There, she was abandoned and the Separatists joined the merchant adventurers on board the Mayflower.</p> <p>The focal point for celebrations should surely be the Dutch city of Leiden, which in a spirit of tolerance and generosity provided a refuge for the Separatists for 12 years.<br><strong>Mick Catmull</strong><br>Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex<br></p> <h2>Jamesian wit<br></h2> <p>Clive James once described Barbara Cartland\u2019s eyes as \u201clike the corpses of two small crows that had crashed into a chalk cliff\u201d (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/dec/01/clive-james-last-interview-philip-larkin-rachel-cooke\" title=\"\">Clive James: the last interview</a>\u201d, Focus; and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/01/jonathan-miller-clive-james-playful-pair-pricked-grim-respectability-of-postwar-british-culture\" title=\"\">The playful pair who pricked the grim respectability of postwar British culture</a>\u201d, Comment).<br><strong>Robert Kelso</strong><br>Milton Abbas, Dorset<br></p>",

Geoff Naylor Colden Common, Winchester Hampshire End this songbird slaughter Your report on the killing of songbirds is a depressing indictment of EU member states\u2019 failure to enforce the EU birds directive and the egregious exceptionalism permitted to \u201crural traditions\u201d that governments, pressured by vested interests, insist upon (\u201cSlaughter of the songbirds: the fight against France\u2019s \u2018barbaric\u2019 glue traps\u201d, Focus). Gluing, trapping, netting, poisoning and shooting of birds are endemic throughout the Mediterranean region. While your report focuses on France, where half a million birds are killed annually, Birdlife International reports that Italy kills 5.6m a year, Cyprus 2.3m. Greece, Croatia and Malta also kill vast numbers. Across the Mediterranean, including North Africa, an estimated 25m birds are killed each year. With populations of almost all birds in freefall, this abomination must be outlawed and effectively policed. Sadly, post-Brexit, the UK voice in opposition to the barbaric persecution of wild birds will no longer be heard. Dr Simon Sweeney Sheriff Hutton, York New mothers deserve better Margaret Jones (Letters) echoes my despair at the relentless deterioration of our maternity services, which are predicated on a return home six hours after birth. This breathtaking lack of respect, time or ceremony afforded to mothers, babies and midwives is a direct result of the maternity tariff, which is too low. As a consequence, all maternity hospitals and units are unviable, which explains why clinical commissioning groups are so keen to shut/reduce maternity units. Chief midwives and obstetricians have long campaigned for the tariff to be raised but their voices are not heeded.There are too many episodes involved in comprehensive maternity care and the commissioning number-crunchers have responded with a system that sets targets on time and bed occupancy regardless of long-term consequences. A healthy and confident mother determines the health and wellbeing of the family. It is the foundation stone of our nation\u2019s health. The inadequate maternity tariff fundamentally undermines this. Penny Griffiths Winkleigh, Devon Plymouth comes up trumps Plymouth is fortunate to be the focal point for celebrations surrounding the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower\u2019s journey to America. (\u201cBehind the scenes\u201d, The New Review). None of the \u201cpilgrims\u201d came from the region, neither did the ship or its captain. And it\u2019s arguable whether the ship can be said to have set sail from there. In July 1620, the Speedwell sailed from the Dutch port of Delfshaven carrying 35 members of the English Separatist church, originally from the East Midlands. They had fled England in 1608 to escape imprisonment for their beliefs. Now they were on their way to America. At the same time, the Mayflower set sail from London with 67 merchant adventurers on board, heading for Southampton and a rendezvous with the Speedwell. The two ships were to sail in tandem to the New World. But the Speedwell was taking on water and had to put in for repairs in Plymouth. There, she was abandoned and the Separatists joined the merchant adventurers on board the Mayflower. The focal point for celebrations should surely be the Dutch city of Leiden, which in a spirit of tolerance and generosity provided a refuge for the Separatists for 12 years. Mick Catmull Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex Jamesian wit Clive James once described Barbara Cartland\u2019s eyes as \u201clike the corpses of two small crows that had crashed into a chalk cliff\u201d (\u201cClive James: the last interview\u201d, Focus; and \u201cThe playful pair who pricked the grim respectability of postwar British culture\u201d, Comment).

Three-course lunch \u00a318; five-course dinner \u00a335; wines from \u00a320</strong></p> <p>This one must start at the end: with a treacle tart that tastes of all the good things, including attention to detail and a determined eagerness to please. The tart case is thin and crisp and dark; just the right amounts of brown sugar, butter and flour have been introduced to each other and have then decided to shack up together. It\u2019s a virtuous platform for the filling. Unlike some treacle tarts, which you know will sit so heavily in your stomach they appear to have claimed squatter\u2019s rights, this one is light and almost fluffy. There is a burst of citrus in there, pointed up by a separate bowl of lemon jelly. Next to that is a jug of warm, frothy cream, flavoured with Earl Grey tea. Both of those, however crowd-pleasing, are here only to stand in the service of the tart. As I fork it away, I mutter sagely to my companion that it is a treacle tart made by someone who has made an awful lot of them.</p> <p>I\u2019m not wrong. That person is Mary-Ellen McTague. She made her name at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/28/restaurant-review-aumbry-prestwich\" title=\"\">Aumbry</a> in Prestwich before eventually opening the <a href=\"https://www.thecreameries.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Creameries</a> on a shopping parade here in the Manchester suburb of Chorlton in 2018. Originally, it was a retail bakery, which also served a few other things to nibble on. McTague stepped away for a while and only returned in September. Now there is a tight \u00a318, three-course menu at lunchtime with a couple of choices at each stage, and a five-course menu in the evenings at \u00a335. Both change regularly. \u201cThe lunch menu sometimes changes during service if we run out of something, or if something else comes in,\u201d she tells me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"385e3ccb542df1b21f55bd6bced6e5affb4df995\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/385e3ccb542df1b21f55bd6bced6e5affb4df995/692_687_4227_2536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A slice of treacle tart on a round white plate, with a small round pot of lemon jelly and another of Earl Grey cream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Tastes of all the good things\u2019: treacle tart, lemon jelly and Earl Grey cream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaw &amp; Shaw/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask McTague when she first made that treacle tart. She tells me it would have been in 2004, when she was first with Heston Blumenthal at the <a href=\"https://www.thefatduck.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Fat Duck</a>, where she worked for many years. The Creameries looks so damn casual, as if there could be little to see here beyond a well-frothed cappuccino. The space is big on hard surfaces: polished concrete floors, gunmetal-grey painted walls, softened by foliage allowed to grow hither and yon from hanging baskets. There are sturdy wooden tables and benches that, in busy times, you will be required to share. Those menus are scratched up on blackboards, the better to change them at speed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are only two choices at each course, so we have the entire menu</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s the reverse of one of those flash outfits that does the restaurant equivalent of kissing a bicep in the mirror, through over-engineered glassware and menus that are so embossed you can feel the letters under your fingertips. The Creameries will never bang on about taking you on a journey. McTague doesn\u2019t want to take you anywhere except to your happy place. None of that, however, should obscure the vast amounts of technique involved here. Split peas are cooked down to a soft, savoury pur\u00e9e that is allowed to cool then cut into chips and deep fried. They arrive stacked as if for a game of Jenga you\u2019ll never play, alongside a long, thick teardrop of a hugely savoury mushroom ketchup. There\u2019s also a tiny bowl of what used to be called chipsticks: matchstick-thin crisps, seasoned with lime pickle that has been dehydrated and ground down to a powder. They are powerfully salty, but that doesn\u2019t stop us finishing them, until the sides of our tongues are vibrating.</p> <p>They do, of course, still make bread here. It\u2019s the best of sourdoughs. There is both a nutty scoop of brown butter and another of butter churned up with a sauerkraut liquor to become a big old dollop of boisterous tang. You may wonder about a person who stands staring at a lump of butter and thinks: \u201cWhat this really needs is some of the liquor from that sauerkraut over there.\u201d Instinctively, I like that person.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c98e53a5f45701e831fac3954de81986815c644\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c98e53a5f45701e831fac3954de81986815c644/887_683_4081_2449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Split-pea chips with a swirl of mushroom ketchup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Stacked for a game of Jenga you\u2019ll never play\u2019: split-pea chips.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaw &amp; Shaw/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are only two choices at each course, so we have the entire menu. Two meaty pieces of their own lightly smoked mackerel have been seared and then served up with both a pur\u00e9e of pickled beetroot and a mustard cream. There are crunchy black pebbles of fried rye bread for texture. A thick cauliflower soup is swirled through with a <a href=\"https://killeenfarmhousecheese.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Killeen</a> cheese sauce. Bobbing in the middle is a cheese beignet. It\u2019s cauliflower cheese in soup form. Across the top is sprinkled a little cumin salt.</p> <p>Meat makes only rare appearances. In this case it is a savoury deep pastry tart case filled with a glossy parsnip pur\u00e9e and then laid with pink pieces of partridge and pheasant to make what she calls a game pie. There is a heap of buttered kale on the side. Some people will look at pictures of this and complain about its compact size. They will make jokes about needing a burger on the way home that are so damn funny your sides will require suturing. As ever, I insist you take a look at me, take in the full 360 degrees of this adult male with shoulders so broad they\u2019re in different time zones, and recognise that if I\u2019m not complaining about portion size, you shouldn\u2019t either.

      "bodyText": "The Creameries, 406 Wilbraham Road, Chorlton, Manchester M21 0SD (0161 312 8328). Three-course lunch \u00a318; five-course dinner \u00a335; wines from \u00a320 This one must start at the end: with a treacle tart that tastes of all the good things, including attention to detail and a determined eagerness to please. The tart case is thin and crisp and dark; just the right amounts of brown sugar, butter and flour have been introduced to each other and have then decided to shack up together. It\u2019s a virtuous platform for the filling. Unlike some treacle tarts, which you know will sit so heavily in your stomach they appear to have claimed squatter\u2019s rights, this one is light and almost fluffy. There is a burst of citrus in there, pointed up by a separate bowl of lemon jelly. Next to that is a jug of warm, frothy cream, flavoured with Earl Grey tea. Both of those, however crowd-pleasing, are here only to stand in the service of the tart. As I fork it away, I mutter sagely to my companion that it is a treacle tart made by someone who has made an awful lot of them. I\u2019m not wrong. That person is Mary-Ellen McTague. She made her name at the Aumbry in Prestwich before eventually opening the Creameries on a shopping parade here in the Manchester suburb of Chorlton in 2018. Originally, it was a retail bakery, which also served a few other things to nibble on. McTague stepped away for a while and only returned in September. Now there is a tight \u00a318, three-course menu at lunchtime with a couple of choices at each stage, and a five-course menu in the evenings at \u00a335. Both change regularly. \u201cThe lunch menu sometimes changes during service if we run out of something, or if something else comes in,\u201d she tells me. I ask McTague when she first made that treacle tart. She tells me it would have been in 2004, when she was first with Heston Blumenthal at the Fat Duck, where she worked for many years. The Creameries looks so damn casual, as if there could be little to see here beyond a well-frothed cappuccino. The space is big on hard surfaces: polished concrete floors, gunmetal-grey painted walls, softened by foliage allowed to grow hither and yon from hanging baskets. There are sturdy wooden tables and benches that, in busy times, you will be required to share. Those menus are scratched up on blackboards, the better to change them at speed. It\u2019s the reverse of one of those flash outfits that does the restaurant equivalent of kissing a bicep in the mirror, through over-engineered glassware and menus that are so embossed you can feel the letters under your fingertips. The Creameries will never bang on about taking you on a journey. McTague doesn\u2019t want to take you anywhere except to your happy place. None of that, however, should obscure the vast amounts of technique involved here. Split peas are cooked down to a soft, savoury pur\u00e9e that is allowed to cool then cut into chips and deep fried. They arrive stacked as if for a game of Jenga you\u2019ll never play, alongside a long, thick teardrop of a hugely savoury mushroom ketchup. There\u2019s also a tiny bowl of what used to be called chipsticks: matchstick-thin crisps, seasoned with lime pickle that has been dehydrated and ground down to a powder. They are powerfully salty, but that doesn\u2019t stop us finishing them, until the sides of our tongues are vibrating. They do, of course, still make bread here. It\u2019s the best of sourdoughs. There is both a nutty scoop of brown butter and another of butter churned up with a sauerkraut liquor to become a big old dollop of boisterous tang. You may wonder about a person who stands staring at a lump of butter and thinks: \u201cWhat this really needs is some of the liquor from that sauerkraut over there.\u201d Instinctively, I like that person. There are only two choices at each course, so we have the entire menu. Two meaty pieces of their own lightly smoked mackerel have been seared and then served up with both a pur\u00e9e of pickled beetroot and a mustard cream. There are crunchy black pebbles of fried rye bread for texture. A thick cauliflower soup is swirled through with a Killeen cheese sauce. Bobbing in the middle is a cheese beignet. It\u2019s cauliflower cheese in soup form. Across the top is sprinkled a little cumin salt. Meat makes only rare appearances. In this case it is a savoury deep pastry tart case filled with a glossy parsnip pur\u00e9e and then laid with pink pieces of partridge and pheasant to make what she calls a game pie. There is a heap of buttered kale on the side. Some people will look at pictures of this and complain about its compact size. They will make jokes about needing a burger on the way home that are so damn funny your sides will require suturing. As ever, I insist you take a look at me, take in the full 360 degrees of this adult male with shoulders so broad they\u2019re in different time zones, and recognise that if I\u2019m not complaining about portion size, you shouldn\u2019t either. Eat three courses here and you will not go hungry. The other main is buttery, seared chunks of cabbice cabbage, on a big mess of more long-cooked split peas.

      "body": "<p><strong>Gusbourne Estate Brut Reserve, Kent, England 2015 (\u00a339, <a href=\"http://gusbourne.com\">gusbourne.com</a>) </strong>Whatever our political persuasion, and whether it\u2019s to provide commiseration or celebration, many of us will be opening a bottle or two come Thursday evening and Friday morning. In a climate of bitter division, we may well look to wines that feel like they\u2019re safely on our side. That\u2019s easy enough for the Tories, since they have what will feel like some ready-made merchandise in the shape of one of the very finest champagnes around: the gorgeously rich and silky-moussed Pol Roger Cuv\u00e9e Winston Churchill 2008 (from \u00a3179.95, <a href=\"http://leaandsandeman.co.uk\">leaandsandeman.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://laithwaites.co.uk\">laithwaites.co.uk</a>), which is made in special years as a homage to Sir Winston, a noted Pol Roger fan. For those Conservatives (and Brexit Party-goers) not wanting to sully their election night with anything French, there\u2019s a very fine English alternative: the exquisite Gusbourne sparkler hails from an estate whose majority owner is Tory peer Lord Ashcroft.</p> <p><strong>Cave de St Verny Puy de D\u00f4me Pinot Noir, France 2018 (\u00a39.50, <a href=\"http://thewinesociety.com\">thewinesociety.com</a>) </strong>There may be no Cuvee Clement Atlee available for Labour voters. But any fully automated luxury communist fully committed to the luxury part of their creed may want to seek out and share an old bottle of Piedmontese producer Bartolo Mascarello\u2019s No Barrique No Berlusconi. These are collector\u2019s items now, but the original bottles, made, by the late Bartolo Mascarello, as a protest against the floridly devious, buffoonish right-wing ex-Italian PM will surely strike a chord for this election. If that\u2019s impossible to find, you could seek out one of the hauntingly elegant, traditional-style wines made by Bartolo\u2019s daughter, Maria-Teresa, such as the Bartolo Mascarello Barbera d\u2019Alba 2016 (\u00a365, <a href=\"http://handford.net\">handford.net</a>). The Bartolo wines are not exactly priced for the many, but Cave de St Verny\u2019s pinot from The Wine Society ticks a lot of Labour boxes: it\u2019s a gorgeously vibrant red that is both made and sold by co-operatives.</p> <p><strong>Ciello Catarratto Baglio Bianco, Sicily, Italy 2018 (from \u00a314.75, <a href=\"http://shop.vinoteca.co.uk\">shop.vinoteca.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://forestwines.com\">forestwines.com</a>) </strong>The SNP has spent much of this election talking about their desire for Scotland to stay in Europe. Made by Norrel Roberson, a Scottish master of wine based in Calatayud in north eastern Spain, the exuberantly bramble fruity, soft but powerful red El Escoces Volante La Multa Garnacha, Calatayud, Spain 2017 (\u00a39.75, <a href=\"http://thewhiskyeschange.com\">thewhiskyeschange.com</a>) therefore has obvious allegorical appeal. Also trying to present a cosmopolitan pro-European but fiscally responsible image, the Lib Dems could go for any EU-made wine \u2013 but ideally something with a touch of austerity like Morrisons The Best Petit Chablis 2017 (\u00a311), a lean, crisp classic chardonnay from northern Burgundy. Or, if they want to push the button on something explosively tasty and more literally metaphorical, the orange bookers could go for an orange wine such as Ciello\u2019s with its Cox\u2019s apple, mandarin and subtle spice \u2013 a wine that, thanks to its organic credentials, should also appeal to Greens.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Gusbourne Estate Brut Reserve, Kent, England 2015 (\u00a339, gusbourne.com) Whatever our political persuasion, and whether it\u2019s to provide commiseration or celebration, many of us will be opening a bottle or two come Thursday evening and Friday morning. In a climate of bitter division, we may well look to wines that feel like they\u2019re safely on our side. That\u2019s easy enough for the Tories, since they have what will feel like some ready-made merchandise in the shape of one of the very finest champagnes around: the gorgeously rich and silky-moussed Pol Roger Cuv\u00e9e Winston Churchill 2008 (from \u00a3179.95, leaandsandeman.co.uk; laithwaites.co.uk), which is made in special years as a homage to Sir Winston, a noted Pol Roger fan. For those Conservatives (and Brexit Party-goers) not wanting to sully their election night with anything French, there\u2019s a very fine English alternative: the exquisite Gusbourne sparkler hails from an estate whose majority owner is Tory peer Lord Ashcroft. Cave de St Verny Puy de D\u00f4me Pinot Noir, France 2018 (\u00a39.50, thewinesociety.com) There may be no Cuvee Clement Atlee available for Labour voters. But any fully automated luxury communist fully committed to the luxury part of their creed may want to seek out and share an old bottle of Piedmontese producer Bartolo Mascarello\u2019s No Barrique No Berlusconi. These are collector\u2019s items now, but the original bottles, made, by the late Bartolo Mascarello, as a protest against the floridly devious, buffoonish right-wing ex-Italian PM will surely strike a chord for this election. If that\u2019s impossible to find, you could seek out one of the hauntingly elegant, traditional-style wines made by Bartolo\u2019s daughter, Maria-Teresa, such as the Bartolo Mascarello Barbera d\u2019Alba 2016 (\u00a365, handford.net). The Bartolo wines are not exactly priced for the many, but Cave de St Verny\u2019s pinot from The Wine Society ticks a lot of Labour boxes: it\u2019s a gorgeously vibrant red that is both made and sold by co-operatives. Ciello Catarratto Baglio Bianco, Sicily, Italy 2018 (from \u00a314.75, shop.vinoteca.co.uk; forestwines.com) The SNP has spent much of this election talking about their desire for Scotland to stay in Europe. Made by Norrel Roberson, a Scottish master of wine based in Calatayud in north eastern Spain, the exuberantly bramble fruity, soft but powerful red El Escoces Volante La Multa Garnacha, Calatayud, Spain 2017 (\u00a39.75, thewhiskyeschange.com) therefore has obvious allegorical appeal. Also trying to present a cosmopolitan pro-European but fiscally responsible image, the Lib Dems could go for any EU-made wine \u2013 but ideally something with a touch of austerity like Morrisons The Best Petit Chablis 2017 (\u00a311), a lean, crisp classic chardonnay from northern Burgundy. Or, if they want to push the button on something explosively tasty and more literally metaphorical, the orange bookers could go for an orange wine such as Ciello\u2019s with its Cox\u2019s apple, mandarin and subtle spice \u2013 a wine that, thanks to its organic credentials, should also appeal to Greens.

There\u2019s a final act of showing off, which includes national dances, solos for Aurora, the spirit of dawn (danced with musicality to her fingertips by <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/fumi-kaneko\" title=\"\">Fumi Kaneko</a>) and a character called Prayer. There\u2019s also some deeply beautiful choreography for Swanilda and her friends, who have a pretty habit of trailing around the stage holding hands, and a score by Delibes that lifts the heart.</p> <p>It\u2019s essentially a domestic ballet, rooted in village life, evoked with wit by Osbert Lancaster\u2019s picture-book settings and costumes that add embroidered bodices and pinnies for the women and dashing cloaks for the men to the more conventional tutus and tights. The strangeness in the story comes from the inventor Dr Copp\u00e9lius, who fills his locked workshop with human-sized dolls and tries to steal the life out of Franz\u2019s body to bring Copp\u00e9lia to life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ac5b6d5bf1d3f2f0482d748b39ef20dab47ddc2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac5b6d5bf1d3f2f0482d748b39ef20dab47ddc2f/0_0_4552_3105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Campbell (Franz) and Francesca Hayward (Swanilda) in Copp\u00e9lia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexander Campbell (Franz) and Francesca Hayward (Swanilda) in Copp\u00e9lia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gary Avis plays Copp\u00e9lius as one of life\u2019s loners; slightly sinister in his obsessions, but neither as frightening nor as tormented as he can be when Swanilda breaks into his workshop and takes Copp\u00e9lia\u2019s place, in dances of jerky virtuosity. In this, as in everything, <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/francesca-hayward\" title=\"\">Francesca Hayward</a> is a picture of utter charm, making dancing look as if it is the most natural way to communicate. From her very first solo, when she pouts and sulks as the doll in the window refuses to return her cheery greeting, she turns Swanilda into a young woman who knows her own mind; her disappointment when Franz (a lively <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/alexander-campbell\" title=\"\">Alexander Campbell</a>) fails to pay her enough attention is touching, her eventual capitulation to love entrancing.</p> <p>She finds, too, the grace notes in the dancing: perfectly placed arabesques, quick jumps, and \u2013 most gorgeous of all \u2013 little turns in attitude when she twists under Campbell\u2019s arm while staying elegantly balanced on pointe. Hayward is about to become very famous as a star of the film version of <em>Cats</em>. If you want to see her in her natural element, head for the Opera House.

      "bodyText": "Dance has a strange relationship with its past. No art form looks back more, fretting away at keeping the detail of past performances alive. Yet in no other sphere is it so difficult to preserve exactly what a creator intended: styles and tastes change, steps get forgotten, embellishments are added. Look at Alexei Ratmansky\u2019s new production of Giselle for the Bolshoi; it incorporates touches from a production documented in 1860, as well as adding a new section of his own choreography, in pursuit of something that seems authentic. Or take the Royal Ballet\u2019s production of Copp\u00e9lia, first danced at the Paris Opera in 1870, which arrived in Britain in 1933 in a version that had been reimagined by Lev Ivanov and Enrico Cecchetti, brought from Russia by Nicholas Sergeyev and then restaged by the company\u2019s founder, Ninette de Valois, in 1940. Her version of this story of a lively lass called Swanilda and her errant fiance, Franz, who falls in love with a doll called Copp\u00e9lia, was once a staple of the repertory \u2013 it often felt like the only ballet I saw as a child \u2013 emphasising as it did the quick feet and characterful drama of De Valois\u2019s company as they established an English style. But it\u2019s 13 years since the Royal last danced it. Its arrival on the Christmas stage is a gift for dancers and audiences alike, an old-fashioned package full of glorious oddity. There\u2019s a final act of showing off, which includes national dances, solos for Aurora, the spirit of dawn (danced with musicality to her fingertips by Fumi Kaneko) and a character called Prayer. There\u2019s also some deeply beautiful choreography for Swanilda and her friends, who have a pretty habit of trailing around the stage holding hands, and a score by Delibes that lifts the heart. It\u2019s essentially a domestic ballet, rooted in village life, evoked with wit by Osbert Lancaster\u2019s picture-book settings and costumes that add embroidered bodices and pinnies for the women and dashing cloaks for the men to the more conventional tutus and tights. The strangeness in the story comes from the inventor Dr Copp\u00e9lius, who fills his locked workshop with human-sized dolls and tries to steal the life out of Franz\u2019s body to bring Copp\u00e9lia to life. Gary Avis plays Copp\u00e9lius as one of life\u2019s loners; slightly sinister in his obsessions, but neither as frightening nor as tormented as he can be when Swanilda breaks into his workshop and takes Copp\u00e9lia\u2019s place, in dances of jerky virtuosity. In this, as in everything, Francesca Hayward is a picture of utter charm, making dancing look as if it is the most natural way to communicate. From her very first solo, when she pouts and sulks as the doll in the window refuses to return her cheery greeting, she turns Swanilda into a young woman who knows her own mind; her disappointment when Franz (a lively Alexander Campbell) fails to pay her enough attention is touching, her eventual capitulation to love entrancing. She finds, too, the grace notes in the dancing: perfectly placed arabesques, quick jumps, and \u2013 most gorgeous of all \u2013 little turns in attitude when she twists under Campbell\u2019s arm while staying elegantly balanced on pointe. Hayward is about to become very famous as a star of the film version of Cats. If you want to see her in her natural element, head for the Opera House. She\u2019s one for the ages, a dancer who can take the ballets of the past and make them live for today. \u2022 Copp\u00e9lia is at the Royal Opera House, London, until 7 January 2020",

In that series we met Matthew Heawood and Kennedy Fisher, the two hosts of Mystery Machine, a podcast about, yes, unsolved or unusual true-life mysteries.

It\u2019s the companion series to The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, one of my absolute favourite shows of last year. In that series we met Matthew Heawood and Kennedy Fisher, the two hosts of Mystery Machine, a podcast about, yes, unsolved or unusual true-life mysteries. They followed up a story about a man who seemed to disappear from a locked room in a sanatorium, and that tale led them, twistily, to a strange and scary occult world, where strange and scary things happened.

NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said overnight conditions had improved. \u201cWe\u2019ve got much more benign conditions, particularly a dominant easterly influence which will stretch pretty much right across most of our fire grounds,\u201d he told Seven News. \u201cWhich means hundreds - as a matter of fact more than 1600 - firefighters are around again today doing really important and critical back burning and containment-line consolidation to try and gain the upper hand before we see those conditions deteriorate into Tuesday.\u201d Already this fire season, six people have died and more than 1,000 homes have been lost across NSW and Queensland.

Temperatures will also soar in the state\u2019s north-west, where they are forecast to hit 44C in Bourke and 43C in Colbar. In Queensland late on Saturday, a shipping container filled with fireworks exploded and residents were forced to flee their homes as an unpredictable fire threatened homes in Bundamba, on the outskirts of the state capital, Brisbane. Residents within an three-kilometre-squared exclusion zone were ordered out as the firefront was waterbombed but fire crews warned they might not be able to stop the fast-moving blaze. Conditions have eased off, a spokeswoman for Queensland\u2019s Fire and Emergency Services said on Sunday morning, however are expected to pick up later in the day. A high fire danger rating is in place for the Darling Downs and Granite Belt to Cape York Peninsula, and will ramp up to severe in the Northern Goldfields and Upper Flinders on Monday. One home was reportedly destroyed in the Bundamba fire on Saturday night. The chief scientist at the Australian Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Dr Bidda Jones, said that, beyond the human cost of the fires, the widespread blazes would have a \u201cmajor impact of biodiversity\u201d. \u201cDepending on the intensity of the fire, it will have had a massive impact on wildlife,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd not just on those iconic species like koalas.

The stunt on Saturday afforded a whole new meaning to gallery founder Emmanuel Perrotin\u2019s comments earlier this week, when he said: \u201cMaurizio\u2019s work is not just about objects, but about how objects move through the world.\u201d All is not lost for the buyer, who, let\u2019s face it, was going to have to deal with the demise of the banana at some point. The work apparently comes with a certificate of authenticity, and owners can replace the banana. \u201c[Datuna] did not destroy the art work. The banana is the idea,\u201d Lucien Terras, a director at the gallery, told the Miami Herald. The idea soon lived on, with a fresh banana affixed by Perrotin minutes later. \u201cThis has been interesting,\u201d said Miami Beach police captain Steven Feldman, who was called in to maintain order as the crowd swelled. The artwork was originally hailed by Perrotin as \u201ca symbol of global trade, a double entendre, as well as a classic device for humour\u201d. Cattelan \u2013 who bought the banana at a local fruit market \u2013 is known for his comic pieces, including a fully functional 18-carat gold toilet titled America, which visitors to the Guggenheim were encouraged to use. The toilet was recently stolen from an exhibition in England. In a 1999 piece, Cattelan duct-taped famed Italian gallerist Massimo De Carlo to the walls of his own gallery.",

      "bodyText": "Senior Morrison government ministers have continued to downplay suggestions the government could accept the New Zealand offer to resettle refugees in offshore detention, amid ongoing speculation about the terms of an arrangement made with Senate crossbencher Jacqui Lambie. Mathias Cormann reiterated on Sunday that the government had made no deal with Lambie in exchange for her support in repealing the medevac laws earlier this week. Lambie said previously she chose to support the government after it agreed to an \u201coutcome\u201d following prolonged negotiations. Lambie has refused to lay out the terms of the deal, citing national security concerns, but told parliament: \u201cWe\u2019ve worked to an outcome I believe we both want \u2026 I am more than satisfied that the conditions are now in place to allow medevac to be repealed.\u201d The government insists it has struck no deal. Cormann appeared on the ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday and was asked repeatedly if the government was examining the New Zealand resettlement option as part of Lambie\u2019s proposal, a policy it had previously rejected. \u201cIt\u2019s current government policy to resettle people from Nauru and to resettle as many as possible,\u201d Cormann said. \u201cIt is currently the government\u2019s position, as it has been all the way through, to resettle people on Nauru [in a way] that doesn\u2019t give the people, the green light to people smugglers.
