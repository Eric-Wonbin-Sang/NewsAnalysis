They had recently travelled to the UK from China. They were staying at a hotel in York when they fell ill and were taken to Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary for treatment.</p> \n  <p><strong>6 February </strong>A third person in the UK is diagnosed in Brighton and transferred to Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 in London. It later emerges that the patient, businessman Steve Walsh, contracted the virus at a conference in Singapore. On his way back to the UK, he stopped off for several days at a French ski chalet, where five Britons were subsequently infected with the virus.</p> \n  <p><strong>9 February </strong>Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says a fourth person has been diagnosed in the UK, believed to be a contact of Walsh. It is later confirmed that the virus was passed on in France.</p> \n  <p><strong>10 February </strong>Four more patients in England test positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to eight. Those infected are all contacts of Walsh and Public Health England (PHE) confirms two are healthcare workers. The four newly diagnosed people had contracted the virus in France.</p> \n  <p><strong>13 February </strong>A woman in London becomes the ninth person to test positive for the illness in the UK - the first confirmed case in the capital. The patient, also moved to Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019, contracted the virus in China, Whitty says. As with previously confirmed cases, officials work to identify people who had been in recent contact with the woman.</p> \n  <p><strong>23 February </strong>Four Britons rescued from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan test positive for the illness in the UK, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 13. They were among a group of 30 Britons and two Irish citizens who arrived at a quarantine block at Arrowe Park hospital in Merseyside a day earlier. Whitty said the virus was passed on when all four were on board the vessel.</p> \n  <p><strong>27 February </strong>The first case of Covid-19 is diagnosed in Northern Ireland, while two more people tested positive across the rest of the UK. The patient in Belfast had recently returned from northern Italy and had previously been in Dublin. Another of the new cases, a parent at a Buxton primary school in Derbyshire, contracted the virus in Tenerife. The third patient also contracted the virus in Italy.</p> \n  <p><strong>28 February </strong>The number of confirmed UK cases jumps to 20 after Wales reports its first patient and three more are identified in England. Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales confirmed a man had been diagnosed with the virus after travelling back to Wales from Italy.</p> \n  <p>Two of the new cases identified in England had recently travelled back from Iran. Meanwhile, a patient identified in Surrey becomes the first to catch the illness within the UK. Prof Whitty says it is not clear if the patient had contracted the virus \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from somebody who had recently travelled abroad.</p> \n  <p><strong>29 February </strong>Three more patients are identified in England. Two of the patients had recently travelled back from Italy while the other had returned from Asia.</p> \n  <p><strong>1 March </strong>The UK total climbs to 36 after 13 new patients are identified, with Scotland reporting its first case. Three of the latest cases in England are family members of a man from Surrey who was the first to catch the illness within the UK. All four are adults, including one more from Surrey and two from West Sussex, and are not GPs or health workers, acting regional director for the south of England for PHE says.</p> \n  <p>Another new patient, from Essex, had no relevant travel to an affected area, according to Whitty, and it was unclear whether the patient had contracted it \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from somebody who had recently travelled abroad.</p> \n  <p>The eight remaining cases include one from Bury, Greater Manchester, who was infected in Italy, two new patients from Hertfordshire and one in London. Three cases were confirmed in West Yorkshire, including two Leeds residents \u2013 who became infected in Iran \u2013 while one is from Bradford who had been in Italy.</p> \n  <p>Another is from Gloucestershire and is linked to a member of staff at a school in the Cotswolds, identified the day before. Meanwhile, the first person in Scotland to be diagnosed is a Tayside resident who recently travelled from Italy.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5c20158f0811db2fb01a78\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-01T21:08:28.434Z\">9.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: \u2018Scottish coronavirus case not unexpected\u2019</strong></p> \n  <p>Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first confirmed case in Scotland was \u201cnot unexpected\u201d. </p> \n  <p>In an interview with Sky News a few minutes ago, said they had been preparing for this occasion \u201cfor some time\u201d and that she was expecting more cases in the coming days and weeks.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon reiterated much of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/01/coronavirus-latest-updates-coronavirus-live-updates-latest-news-china-wuhan-stock-markets-update-china-iran-us-australia-south-korea-japan?page=with:block-5e5c13dd8f086a28115b5a36#block-5e5c13dd8f086a28115b5a36\">earlier statement</a>, and said the Scottish coronavirus patient is clinically well. </p> \n  <p><strong>Confident in the NHS response</strong></p> \n  <p>The first minister also assured the public that the UK was well-equipped to deal with a rise in cases. \u201cAll the things that should be done are being done\u201d, she said. \u201cWe have to be prepared for a significant outbreak fo coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She said that Scotland remained in the containment phase, and was focusing on trying to limit and contain spread of infection -

As yet the number of cases in the UK who have no relevant travel history remains small but even a couple of such cases indicates community spread here. The current containment strategy is still appropriate for now but we can expect to see further increases in the next few days and consequently the UK\u2019s response will move more towards the next phase of delaying rather than containing infections.

It means that every single case that is found here gets immediate treatment, but also we contact all of the people that that person has been in close contact with. Largely most of the cases so far, are from people who\u2019ve caught the virus elsewhere and brought it here, and we\u2019re then able to contain it.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve put \u00a340m into trying to find a vaccine and also trying to improve the treatments for people who do have the disease. The experts say that a vaccine, even accelerated as fast as possible, is still many months off. But the potential for treatments that make the virus less of a problem if you\u2019ve got it, they are more optimistic. The final plan is to prepare for mitigation should this become endemic in this country and making sure that not only the NHS is prepared, but also all parts of society.

Here\u2019s the latest summary of the key events: Scotland has confirmed its first case of coronavirus, bringing the UK total up to 36. Thirteen of those have been confirmed today alone. A man in Essex became the second person in the UK to be infected with the virus without traveling abroad. A group of Britons who have been on lockdown in a hotel in Tenerife since Tuesday have arrived at the airport to fly home. Dozens of Brits remain inside. The number of cases in Germany has doubled in the last day, and a further 30 cases were announced in France since Saturday, bringing its total up to 130. In Italy, the head of the country\u2019s civil protection agency has confirmed the death toll now stands at 34, five more than a yesterday, while the number of infections has risen 50% to 1,694. New cases have appeared in Chicago and Rhode Island in the US. Non-essential British embassy staff have been withdrawn from Tehran with immediate effect. The death toll in Iran is currently at 54, with 978 confirmed cases. The husband of British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is being held on spying charges in Iran, believes she has contracted coronavirus in prison but says officials are refusing to test her. Australia\u2019s number of confirmed cases has been increased to 29, after a ninth case appeared in Victoria. Israel has confirmed another three cases, two of which were patients who recently returned from Italy but the other was caught locally. This bring\u2019s the country\u2019s total number to 10. The first case of coronavirus has been confirmed in the Dominican Republic, a tourist visiting from Italy. A fifth case has appeared in Mexico \u2013 a young woman who was studying in Milan, Italy, but reportedly returned home to Mexico when her school was shut down because of the virus. You can follow our latest liveblog here: Christopher Betts, 73, is a British holidaymaker who is still in lockdown in the hotel in Tenerife. He arrived at the hotel with his wife on the 18th, and was due to be leaving on the morning the hotel went into quarantine. Christopher told the Guardian he has been tested for coronavirus but hasn\u2019t received his results, and has no idea when he\u2019ll be able to fly home. One of his friends in the hotel is in regular contact with the Foreign Office, and says he\u2019s being told different things depending on which member of staff he speaks to there. \u201cOne branch of Foreign Office says that when you\u2019re negative you can go, another branch says you have to stay for the full isolation period, until March 10,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re operating on a Chinese whispers system. If we have to stop til next Tuesday, fine, we\u2019ll accept it. all we need is clarification.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re getting conflicting stories from our government. Finish and Dutch people in the hotel have said their government have been clear about them staying until the 10th, but we don\u2019t know,\u201d he added. Those who test negative will have to retest when the time comes to fly home, and must leave 24 hours after their negative result. Christopher is concerned that if the remaining Brits are allowed to leave the hotel, they won\u2019t be able to get transport to the airport. He praised the staff at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace for their hospitality during the quarantine period. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t wish for a better hotel,\u201d he said. \u201cStaff and guests were dancing in the restaurant last night, they brought us entertainment. I know people whinge, but you couldn\u2019t wish for anything more under the circumstances. They\u2019re even giving us free drinks.\u201d Israel has confirmed three more cases of coronavirus, bringing its total number to 10. Two of the new cases had recently returned from a trip to Italy, and the third is thought to have been infected within Israel. The three patients have \u201clight\u201d symptoms, Israel\u2019s health ministry said. PA have produced a helpful overview of the UK coronavirus cases, which might help to map out what\u2019s happened so far: 31 January The first cases are reported in the UK when two members of the same family test positive for the virus. They had recently travelled to the UK from China. They were staying at a hotel in York when they fell ill and were taken to Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary for treatment. 6 February A third person in the UK is diagnosed in Brighton and transferred to Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 in London. It later emerges that the patient, businessman Steve Walsh, contracted the virus at a conference in Singapore. On his way back to the UK, he stopped off for several days at a French ski chalet, where five Britons were subsequently infected with the virus. 9 February Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says a fourth person has been diagnosed in the UK, believed to be a contact of Walsh. It is later confirmed that the virus was passed on in France. 10 February Four more patients in England test positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to eight. Those infected are all contacts of Walsh and Public Health England (PHE) confirms two are healthcare workers. The four newly diagnosed people had contracted the virus in France. 13 February A woman in London becomes the ninth person to test positive for the illness in the UK - the first confirmed case in the capital. The patient, also moved to Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019, contracted the virus in China, Whitty says. As with previously confirmed cases, officials work to identify people who had been in recent contact with the woman. 23 February Four Britons rescued from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan test positive for the illness in the UK, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 13. They were among a group of 30 Britons and two Irish citizens who arrived at a quarantine block at Arrowe Park hospital in Merseyside a day earlier. Whitty said the virus was passed on when all four were on board the vessel. 27 February The first case of Covid-19 is diagnosed in Northern Ireland, while two more people tested positive across the rest of the UK. The patient in Belfast had recently returned from northern Italy and had previously been in Dublin. Another of the new cases, a parent at a Buxton primary school in Derbyshire, contracted the virus in Tenerife. The third patient also contracted the virus in Italy. 28 February The number of confirmed UK cases jumps to 20 after Wales reports its first patient and three more are identified in England. Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales confirmed a man had been diagnosed with the virus after travelling back to Wales from Italy. Two of the new cases identified in England had recently travelled back from Iran. Meanwhile, a patient identified in Surrey becomes the first to catch the illness within the UK. Prof Whitty says it is not clear if the patient had contracted the virus \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from somebody who had recently travelled abroad. 29 February Three more patients are identified in England. Two of the patients had recently travelled back from Italy while the other had returned from Asia. 1 March The UK total climbs to 36 after 13 new patients are identified, with Scotland reporting its first case. Three of the latest cases in England are family members of a man from Surrey who was the first to catch the illness within the UK. All four are adults, including one more from Surrey and two from West Sussex, and are not GPs or health workers, acting regional director for the south of England for PHE says. Another new patient, from Essex, had no relevant travel to an affected area, according to Whitty, and it was unclear whether the patient had contracted it \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from somebody who had recently travelled abroad. The eight remaining cases include one from Bury, Greater Manchester, who was infected in Italy, two new patients from Hertfordshire and one in London. Three cases were confirmed in West Yorkshire, including two Leeds residents \u2013 who became infected in Iran \u2013 while one is from Bradford who had been in Italy. Another is from Gloucestershire and is linked to a member of staff at a school in the Cotswolds, identified the day before. Meanwhile, the first person in Scotland to be diagnosed is a Tayside resident who recently travelled from Italy. Nicola Sturgeon: \u2018Scottish coronavirus case not unexpected\u2019 Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first confirmed case in Scotland was \u201cnot unexpected\u201d. In an interview with Sky News a few minutes ago, said they had been preparing for this occasion \u201cfor some time\u201d and that she was expecting more cases in the coming days and weeks. Sturgeon reiterated much of her earlier statement, and said the Scottish coronavirus patient is clinically well. Confident in the NHS response The first minister also assured the public that the UK was well-equipped to deal with a rise in cases. \u201cAll the things that should be done are being done\u201d, she said. \u201cWe have to be prepared for a significant outbreak fo coronavirus.\u201d She said that Scotland remained in the containment phase, and was focusing on trying to limit and contain spread of infection - which was \u201cparticularly important given the lack of coronavirus vaccine\u201d. The first minister said that wider planning for a significant outbreak in coming weeks was underway, including escalation plans for the NHS. \u201cI have a lot of confidence in the plans and procedures that are in place,\u201d she said. She said that steps that will be taken will be informed and guided by best possible advice, and that she wouldn\u2019t rule anything out at this stage. However, she also said that the public \u201chave a big part to play\u201d in stopping the spread of the virus by following public health guidelines. Sturgeon said that Scotland was working with other UK nations, and described it as \u201cvital\u201d to have a co-ordinated, UK wide response. \u201cThis is a virus that will not respect boundaries,\u201d she said. You can read more about the new cases in the US from my colleague Amanda Holpuch in New York. Brazil has so far confirmed only two cases of coronavirus - both Brazillian citizens who had been in Italy. But a report in one of the country\u2019s leading newspapers this Sunday says there are now 252 suspected cases - 136 of them in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo and 19 in Rio de Janeiro. According to the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper, the suspected cases are people who have not just symptoms but have also had contact with a suspected case or a travel history connected to coronavirus. Angola has announced that it will ban citizens from China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, Nigeria, Egypt and Algeria from entering the country. The ban will only apply to those who have travelled directly from those countries, and has been implemented to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Mexico have confirmed a fifth case of the virus - an 18-year-old woman who had been studying in Milan and had recently returned to Chiapas state. The woman tested positive for the virus on Saturday but is asymptomatic, state health authorities said. Authorities said she had returned to Mexico after her school in Italy closed because of the crisis. Two of Mexico\u2019s confirmed cases are in the capital, Mexico City, where schools and nurseries are already starting to adopt special measures to guard against a potential outbreak. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said there were currently no plans to cancel major public events or gatherings because of coronavirus. A nursing home near Seattle is on lockdown after a 70 year old resident and a worker in her 40s tested positive for coronavirus, officials at the home have said. State officials said that an additional 27 residents of the nursing home and 25 staff members are reporting symptoms of the virus, which can be similar to that of the common flu. The Life Care Center of Kirkland is not accepting new patients or allowing visitors, family or vendors into the facility. \u201cConcerned family members or responsible parties may call our facility,\u201d the release posted on its website said. \u201cThe facility is currently placing a hold on admissions as well to fully focus on our current residents and associates.\u201d The two cases were confirmed on Saturday by Washington state officials. The resident is in a serious condition, whilst the worker is in a \u2018satisfactory\u2019 condition. There are around 70 cases in the US. A woman who recently returned from Iran has today been confirmed as the ninth case of coronavirus in the Australian state of Victoria. Australia recorded its first death from Covid-19 on Sunday when a man in his late 70s, who had been evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, died in hospital in Perth. Seven cases from Victoria have recovered and are no longer in isolation. The eighth confirmed case is in a stable condition and is isolated and recovering in hospital. The ninth case, a woman in her 30s from Victoria who returned from Tehran, is recovering in isolation at home. The woman became unwell on February 27 while travelling to Melbourne from Tehran, via Kuala Lumpur and Bali. She travelled on Malindo Air on flight number OD177 and landed in Melbourne on 28 February at 6.04am. The Victorian department of health is following up close contacts on the plane. Across Australia, there have now been 29 confirmed cases: 9 in Queensland 6 in New South Wales 9 in Victoria 3 in South Australia 2 in Western Australia Out of these, 15 have recovered, one has died and the rest are in a stable condition. A coach of Britons who have been in lockdown in a hotel in Tenerife since Tuesday have arrived at an airport terminal to fly home. It is understood that the Brits have been booked on two different flights back to the UK, and they will have to self-isolate on their return. There are still dozens of Brits still inside the hotel, and it is unclear who has been allowed to leave and why. One told Sky News that it was based on \u201cpotluck\u201d according to travel providers. Tests for coronavirus on Brits in the hotel began yesterday and continued in to today. According to Sky New, the Brits were told that if they tested negative, they had 24 hours to get on a flight. One of those leaving said at the airport that he was feeling \u201crelieved\u201d and another praised the hotel staff as \u201cfantastic.\u201d The first person in Scotland has tested positive for coronavirus. The announcement brings the total number of UK cases to 36, 13 of which have been confirmed today. The patient, who is a resident of the Tayside area and had recently travelled from Italy, has now been admitted to hospital and is receiving treatment in isolation. Clinicians have also started to gather details of the places they have visited and the people they have been in contact with since they returned to the UK. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has chaired a meeting of the Scottish government resilience committee this evening, and will be taking part in a similar one chaired by Boris Johnson tomorrow morning. Sturgeon said: \u201cOur first thoughts must be with the patient diagnosed with coronavirus, I wish them a speedy recovery. \u201cScotland is well-prepared for a significant outbreak of coronavirus but there is currently no treatment or vaccine. Early detection measures will continue to be vital in helping to prevent the spread of the virus. \u201cPeople have a vital role to play in helping us contain any outbreak by following the latest health and travel advice, and following basic hygiene precautions, such as washing hands frequently, not touching their face and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.\u201d There have been a total of 698 negative test results in Scotland since the outbreak began. According to Reuters, organisers have said that a conference on the world economy due to take in Italy later this month with Pope Francis taking part has been postponed until November because of the outbreak. Some Britons in the hotel in Tenerife have been allowed to leave, Sky News have said. The number of people in Germany infected rose to 129 on Sunday, up from 66 on Saturday, DW has reported. Nine of Germany\u2019s 16 states now have cases of COVID-19, with Frankfurt, Hamburg and Bremen among the cities reporting their first infections, Germany\u2019s centre for disease control and prevention, the Robert Koch Institute, said. Almost half of the cases, 74 in total, have been confirmed in North Rhine-Westphalia, which is Germany\u2019s most populous state. Bavaria has the next highest number of confirmed cases, with 23, followed by Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg with 15. The Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said people should \u201cstill go about their business\u201d, but that the government was \u201cconsidering all options\u201d. In an interview with Sky News a few minutes ago, he insisted the government\u2019s plan was \u201cvery clear\u201d. What are the government\u2019s steps? Firstly, the government are trying to contain the virus, he said. This meant that \u201cevery single case found here gets immediate treatment\u201d, with their contacts tracked down and given medical advice or checks. Hancock said that the government were trying to delay the onset of the virus, having determined that the UK would be better able to cope with a mass spread of coronavirus in the summer. He also said that the government had invested \u00a340 million into finding a vaccine and treatments for disease. He warned that a vaccine was \u201cstill many months off\u201d even with an accelerated process, but treatments for those who have virus already were \u201cmore optimistic\u201d. What should the public do? When asked if people should follow World Health Organisation advice to other parts of the world that over 60s should avoid shared spaces, he said no, as the cases were still \u201crelatively low\u201d. \u201cIf we get to a position where this is endemic around the world and large scale here, we will change advice,\u201d he added. He also said that stopping flights from China was not the answer, comparing it to Italy, who did stop flights and have much higher numbers of cases than the UK. He echoed Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s earlier statement that the best thing the public can do is wash their hands for 20 seconds. As Johnson referenced earlier, albeit slightly less clearly, the government are telling children to sing \u2018happy birthday\u2019 whilst washing their hands to ensure they wash for long enough. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said there needed to be \u201cmore direction from the Prime Minister\u201d and accused him of being slow to organise COBRA meetings - the government\u2019s emergency response committee. He said that the NHS were \u201creally doing their best\u201d and that clinicians would \u201calways rise to the challenge\u201d. However, he alleged that 80% of the beds needed for coronavirus were already taken up, saying that years of austerity meant resources to tackle the spread of the virus are stretched. Non-essential British embassy staff in Tehran are being withdrawn with immediate effect due to the virus, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has confirmed. The FCO also warned that the embassy\u2019s help to British nationals in Iran would be limited. A statement said: \u201cAs of 1 March, dependants and some staff from the British Embassy are being withdrawn from Iran due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Essential staff needed to continue critical work will remain. \u201cIn the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy to provide assistance to British nationals from within Iran may be limited.\u201d The director general of France\u2019s health service, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, has given the latest figures and there\u2019s another leap on Sunday. The number of confirmed cases has risen to 130, from 100. Of that, 116 people are in hospital \u2013 nine of them in a serious condition \u2013 and 12 people recovered. There have been two deaths New cases include two children, a one-year-old and a five-year-old, who have been hospitalised in Strasbourg in eastern France along with their 27-year-old mother who also tested positive. Their condition has been described as not worrying. Salomon says French travellers should avoid journeys abroad outside the European Union \u201cunless strictly necessary\u201d. Nevertheless, he pointed out the death rate worldwide is 3.4% of confirmed cases. The Manga and Sci-Fi Show salon planned for next week in Paris, which was to have featured giant karaoke and K Pop concerts, has been cancelled. The Trump administration has accused the public of overreacting to the impact of the coronavirus on the economy, and insisted that stocks would bounce back. The S&amp;P 500 index dropped 11.5% last week as coronavirus spread - the worst weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis. \u201cThe stock market that saw some downturns this week, it will come back,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the government\u2019s response to the virus, told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cThe fundamentals of this economy are strong.\u201d he added. Pence also said the government was doing \u201ceverything possible\u201d to prevent the virus from spreading and that he was \u201cconfident\u201d the United States was prepared. U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar told Fox News Sunday that the public was over-reacting to the current threat. The situation in the US A Washington man in his 50s with underlying health conditions was the first American to die from the virus, officials confirmed on Saturday. How the man contracted the virus is still not known. Over the weekend, new cases were confirmed in Chicago and Rhode Island. Morocco is set to postpone sports and cultural events over coronavirus fears, the government health committee has announced. It\u2019s currently unclear how widespread this measure will be. Morocco says it has tested 25 people suspected of having the coronavirus but all have been negative, and the country does not have any confirmed cases. Oman has suspended Italian tourist flights from Salala airport for a month, in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus. Qatar has also announced a temporary ban on visitors from Egypt via intermediate points, the state news agency reported on Sunday. Two new cases were confirmed in Qatar on Sunday, bringing its total to 3. A school in Dublin is set to close for two weeks after a student tested positive for coronavirus, according to the Irish Times. The teenager is the first person in the Republic of Ireland to test positive for the virus, and the case was announced on Saturday evening. The individual became ill in recent days after returning from Italy and is currently in isolation in a Dublin hospital. Students at the school are being told to self-isolate at home if they start presenting symptoms. Andrew Tatem, professor within geography and environmental science at the University of Southampton, has warned that the recent imported cases of coronavirus into China are indicative of a \u201cmove towards a global pandemic\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a stage now where China\u2019s major efforts to stop the outbreak within its borders have meant that it likely has stronger coronavirus surveillance and detection capabilities than anywhere else in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that China is now detecting and reporting imported cases that are coming from Iran and the UK is an indication of how the geographical balance of this outbreak is shifting as we seemingly move towards a global pandemic.\u201d The Dominican Republic has confirmed its first case of coronavirus \u2013 a tourist visiting the country from Italy. The patient is a 62-year-old man, who is in a stable condition. He has been taken to an isolation room in a military hospital near the capital, the country\u2019s health minister, Rafael Sanchez, said at a press conference. Another tourist, a 56-year-old man from France, is under observation at hospital and awaiting test results for coronavirus. On Friday, the Dominican Republic cancelled all flights from Milan for 30 days. The government also said that all travellers retuning from Italy would have to undergo epidemiological reviews at airports. Speaking at a laboratory at the Public Health England national infection service in Colindale, north London, Boris Johnson praised the work of PHE. He said there were likely to be more cases of coronavirus but said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great plan to tackle the spread of coronavirus and I\u2019m confident that in the NHS we\u2019ve got professionals who are able to cope with it.\u201d He also gave tips for stopping the spread of coronavirus: \u201cThe best way we can help the NHS and help ourselves to stop the spread of the illness is to wash our hands. It\u2019s 20 seconds, it\u2019s two times happy birthday. With hot water and soap.\u201d The prime minister will be chairing another Cobra meeting on coronavirus on Monday. \u201cWe will be setting out the various measures in the way public should be responding, and public bodies should be responding.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t be drawn on the details of what these measures might look like. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go now into the kind of things that might be necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be questions we might need to consider about very big public events.\u201d Johnson also said the government may need to consider closing schools, but expressed that he wanted them to remain open and did not want children to be sent home \u201cunnecessarily\u201d. \u201cCoronavirus is of concern, but we amply have the resources to deal with it. Believe me, we are going to beat this,\u201d he said. The number of confirmed cases in Italy has risen to almost 1,700, and the death toll has increased by five to 34, Reuters reports. There were 1,128 cases and 29 death as of last night. This is the largest jump the spread of the virus in one day, Sky News says. Good evening, I\u2019m Molly Blackall, taking over the live coverage of coronavirus for the next few hours. If you spot something I miss, do drop me a tweet: @mollyblackall. Boris Johnson has been on a visit to laboratory at the Public Health England National Infection Service in Colindale, north London. Iraq has reported six new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of cases there to 19, Reuters reports citing the health ministry. The ministry said two of the six are in the capital Baghdad and the other four in Sulaimaniya in the north east of the country. All had recently returned from neighbouring Iran, which has had the highest number of deaths from coronavirus outside of China, where the outbreak originated. The WHO\u2019s director of pandemic diseases, Sylvie Briand, is endorsing the elbow bump and footshakes as safer alternatives to shaking hands. A patient who has tested positive for coronavirus in Rotterdam, had been staying for a week at another hospital in the Netherlands, the news site Nu.nl reports. The patient had stayed at the Beatrix hospital in nearby Gorchem, for a week without being tested, the site said. The hospital did not respond to comment but said it is closed to visitors and new patients. The reason the Louvre in Paris was forced to close on Sunday (see earlier) was that staff refused to work due to coronavirus fears, AFP reports. Around 300 staff met in the morning and voted \u201calmost unanimously\u201d not to open, Christian Galani of the CGT labour union told AFP, leaving many would-be visitors disappointed.. Louvre management later confirmed the museum was closed for the entire day, and said it would refund ticket-holders. \u201cWe apologise for any inconvenience and will keep you informed as the situation develops,\u201d the museum said on its website. On Saturday, the government announced several measures to try and curb the outbreak in France, including cancelling all gatherings of more than 5,000 people in confined spaces. \u201cThe Louvre is a confined space which welcomes more than 5,000 people a day,\u201d said Galani, adding: \u201cthere is real concern on the part of staff.\u201d One of the people who has tested positive for the virus was a resident of Bradford who had travelled to Italy while two others are from Leeds and had travelled to Iran. Dr Simon Padfield, consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health England Yorkshire and the Humber, said: \u201cPublic Health England is contacting people who had close contact with three cases of Covid-19 confirmed in West Yorkshire. \u201cOne of the cases is a resident of Bradford who became infected whilst in Italy and the other two cases are residents of Leeds who both became infected whilst in Iran.\u201d And after a case of Covid-19 was confirmed in Essex, Public Health England (PHE) East said \u201cclose contacts\u201d of the patient were being given health advice about symptoms. Dr David Edwards, consultant in health protection, said: \u201cPublic Health England is contacting people who had close contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19 who is an Essex resident. The Czech Republic has confirmed its first three cases of coronavirus, Health Minister Adam Vojtech said on Sunday. Health officials said at a news conference the three patients showed mild symptoms and had travelled from places in northern Italy. China has confirmed two new cases on Covid-19 from people who had travelled to Iran. All of a sudden, things have rather changed. If the ongoing floods have seemed to leave too many people at the top untroubled, the decisive arrival in the UK of the coronavirus has highlighted two things that were in danger of being forgotten: the most basic responsibilities of any government, and the necessity of seriousness. As cases increase, anxiety mounts and both the human and economic consequences of the virus\u2019s spread start to become clear, the smirk attached to the face of this government will need to go. Preventing a Covid-19 epidemic in the UK is looking increasingly unlikely, according to Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, University of East Anglia. Today\u2019s sharp increase in confirmed cases in the UK shows the country is entering the \u201cnext stage of the epidemic\u201d he said. In remarks distributed by the Science Media Centre, Prof Hunter added: \u201cThe recent sharp increase in the number of reported cases in the UK is a reminder, if any were needed, that we are moving into the next stage of the epidemic. The recent sharp increases in the number of new cases in Italy and then France, Spain and Germany confirm that COVID-19 is spreading in Europe. As yet the number of cases in the UK who have no relevant travel history remains small but even a couple of such cases indicates community spread here. The current containment strategy is still appropriate for now but we can expect to see further increases in the next few days and consequently the UK\u2019s response will move more towards the next phase of delaying rather than containing infections. Although it may still be possible to prevent a community wide epidemic this is looking increasingly unlikely and we should be prepared to cope with a more widespread epidemic on our shores.\u201d Swansea council says its schools will open as normal on Monday despite a confirmd case of covid-10 case in the city - the first in Wales. In a statement it the risk of catching the virus remains low and \u201cno extra measures\u201d need to be taken beyond those set out by Public Health Wales. Here\u2019s the latest summary: Twelve more people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, including the second case of someone who caught the virus within the country. The case will fuel concerns that the virus is circulating undetected. Health authorities are trying to trace people who had come into contact with a 35-year man from Shenzhen who had been working in Bristol and tested positive for coronavirus. He took a Cathay Pacific flight from London Heathrow to Hong Kong on Thursday. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said it may be necessary to follow China\u2019s example by shutting down cities to prevent the spread of coronavirus. He also confirmed plans to bring doctors and nurses out of retirement if the outbreak escalates in the UK. Iran has said its death toll from coronavirus has reached 54 and the number of infected cases is 978. It comes just days after the ministry categorically denied reports 50 people had died from the disease. A top Italian health official has warned of a \u201ctsunami\u201d effect on the hospital system as confirmed coronavirus cases in Italy rose to 1,128. The number killed by the virus in Italy has increased to 29. The authorities in France have announced the number of confirmed cases has jumped to 100, with two deaths. The country has banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people. The Louvre in Paris was closed on Sunday afternoon as staff held a meeting about the virus. The number of confirmed cases in Spain has increased to 73. A fifth person has tested positive for the virus at the hotel in Tenerife that has been locked down after four other people staying there were diagnosed with coronavirus. Donald Trump has said all travellers from at risk areas will be screened for coronavirus after they arrive in the US. The US, Thailand and Australia have all both reported their country\u2019s first deaths from the virus. Japan reported its second death on Sunday \u2013 a man in his 70s on the island of Hokkaido. Two more doctors have died in China and the country\u2019s death tally has risen by 35 to 2,870. Infections have risen 573 to 79,824 (of which 41,825, or 52%, are listed as recovered). Italy\u2019s Serie A football season runs the risk of not finishing if more matches are postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak, Inter Milan\u2019s chief executive Giuseppe Marotta said on Sunday. Reuters reports: Inter\u2019s match at Juventus, which was to have been played later on Sunday, was one of five which were postponed by the league. The games, all in regions where sporting events have been banned by the government, had been due to be played behind closed doors. Italy has registered more than 1,100 confirmed cases and at least 29 deaths. Inter\u2019s match at home to Sampdoria was one of four which were postponed last Sunday and Marotta said a crowded fixture list meant they were running out of dates to reschedule the games. Serie A called an emergency meeting for Wednesday to discuss the consequences of the government measures and the rescheduling of matches. \u201cIf more matches are called off then, yes, we run that risk,\u201d Marotta told Gazzetta dello Sport when asked if the championship might not finish. Serving and former NHS doctors have reacted with scepticism to the idea of bringing former health professionals out of retirement as part of government plans to combat the spread of coronavirus. PA Media has further details about some of the 12 new cases in the UK. Six of the people involved had recently travelled from Italy, while two had been in Iran. These patients are from London, West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire. One of the confirmed cases is in Bury, according to Bury council, which said the patient had been taken to a specialist NHS infection centre. The news comes after the health secretary conceded it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that the deadly virus would continue to spread across the UK. A pub in Haslemere, Surrey, has been closed until further notice for deep cleaning after a customer \u201ctested positive for coronavirus\u201d. A patient in the county was confirmed as the first to catch the illness within the UK on Friday. The landlords of the Prince of Wales pub said on Facebook that they had no symptoms of the virus and that it was a \u201cprecautionary measure only\u201d. On Sunday, the Department of Health and Social Care announced every department would have a ministerial lead on the virus, and a cross-Whitehall \u201cwar room\u201d is being set up to roll out an enhanced public information campaign. Government lawyers are assessing the possibility of delaying the local authority, mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections in May if the coronavirus outbreak continues to escalate, the Guardian can disclose. An email sent to board members of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners on Saturday by its chief executive, Susannah Hancock, reveals that measures to contain the spread of the disease would also include potentially delaying the forthcoming elections. She said that the Home Office, in discussions with the Cabinet Office, had sought legal advice on postponing the elections. South Korea has reported four more coronavirus deaths in the south-eastern city of Daegu, bringing the country\u2019s death toll to 21, the Yonap news agency reports. South Korea has 3,736 confirmed cases of the disease. A widely visited church in Rome has closed over coronavirus fears. The move to shut Rome\u2019s Church of San Luigi dei Francesi, which hosts Caravaggio\u2019s The Calling of St Matthew masterpiece, came after a priest in Paris tested positive for the virus after returning from Italy. Chuang Shuk-kwan, the director of the infectious disease division of the centre for health protection, confirmed the details of the new positive case in a man in Shenzhen who had travelled from London and worked in Bristol. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Chuang said the passenger had been in the business class of flight CX250. The ferry the patient had taken, 3A109, had about 70 passengers, most of whom were Chinese nationals. Chuang advised all passengers on that flight or ferry to call the centre\u2019s hotline and to be \u201caware of the health situation\u201d, and seek medical help or quarantine if necessary. Cathay Pacific is helping authorities trace all passengers who flew from London to Hong Kong, after a passenger on one of its flights, who had been working in Bristol, tested positive. In a statement, it said: Cathay Pacific received notification from the health authorities in Hong Kong regarding a passenger who was recently confirmed to have contracted severe respiratory disease with Novel Infectious Agent. We were informed that the passenger had flown from London to Hong Kong via CX250 on 27 February and arrived Hong Kong on 28 February. We are following the health authorities\u2019 prescribed procedures in conducting disinfection of the aircraft and informing the operating crew and employees, as well as assisting the authorities\u2019 efforts in tracing people who were in close contact with the concerned passenger. We will continue to work closely with the authorities on the case. The man who tested positive for coronavirus in Shenzhen after flying from London last Thursday had been working in Bristol, the Chinese authorities have confirmed. A statement from the Guangdong Health Commission late on Sunday said authorities in Shenzhen had reported an \u201cimported case\u201d of the coronavirus infection, in a 35 year old male from Shenzhen who had been working in Bristol. According to the statement, the patient had travelled to Hong Kong from London on 28 February, on flight CX250 on Cathay Pacific. He landed in Hong Kong at 13:27 and at 15:30 took the ferry 3A109 to Shekou port in Shenzhen arriving at 16:32. His temperature was normal at the time of his arrival. At 16:45 he left from Shekou port and took a taxi to his home in Futian, a district of Shenzhen. \u201cThe patient wore a face mask the entire time,\u201d the statement said. On 29 February around 7am, the patient suffered from symptoms including a cough and fever. Around 10am he was driven to the hospital by family. That evening he tested positive for the virus and around 11pm he was transferred to Shenzhen no 3 hospital for treatment and quarantine. The statement said that at the moment the patient\u2019s condition was \u201cstable.\u201d The statement said that the patient had no history of travel to Hubei and that two of his colleagues in the UK had shown symptoms of cough and fever. Health authorities said that 93 close contacts of the patient had been identified. While 35 people have now tested positive for the virus in the UK, 11,715 have tested negative. One of the 12 people who have tested positive for the virus contracted it from within the UK, according to the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty. In a statement, he said: \u201cOne patient, resident in Essex, had no relevant travel and it is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an individual who had recently returned from abroad; investigations are ongoing.\u201d On Friday, a man from Surrey became the first to test positive to test positive for Covid-19 without having recently been abroad. In his statement, Prof Whitty added: Three patients were close contacts of a known case, transmitted in the UK, identified as part of contact tracing. The patients who have recently travelled are from London, West Yorkshire, Great Manchester, Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire. All are being investigated and contract tracing has begun. The total number of confirmed cases in England is now 33. Following previously reported confirmed cases in Northern Ireland and Wales, the total number of UK cases is 35. The number of confirmed cases in the UK has leaped by 12 to 35. Read the full report here: The Louvre museum in Paris shut on Sunday afternoon, leaving visitors queueing up outside in the rain as staff and management held a meeting about coronavirus. A spokesperson for the museum said it was expected to open after the meeting, held with the staff doctor. Museums are not covered by government instructions for venues or events with more than 5,000 in a confined space to close until further notice. Donald Trump says all travellers from at risk areas will be screened for coronavirus after they arrive in the US. David and Sally Abel, the British passengers who caught coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off Yokohama, are still being treated in an isolation unit in a Japanese hospital. In a video update on Sunday, they said they were recovering well, but Sally said she had tested positive again for the virus, after testing negative last week. David said that by next Friday they will have served four weeks in quarantine. Meanwhile, all crew members from the cruise ship off Japan have now disembarked, the country\u2019s health minister said, AFP reports. The crew began leaving the Diamond Princess on Thursday for quarantine ashore after the last of the passengers had departed. \u201cIncluding the captain, all crew members disembarked,\u201d health minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters late Sunday. Around 130 people \u2013 including the captain and 98 health ministry officials who were working aboard \u2013 tested negative for the virus as they left the vessel, he said. They will spend 14 days at government-designated dormitories before being allowed to leave Japan, while the vessel will be disinfected before sailing again. At least six people who were hospitalised after being taken off the ship have died, including a British male passenger, the health ministry said. On Sunday, a 78-year-old man evacuated from the vessel died at a Perth hospital, becoming Australia\u2019s first fatality from the disease. The quarantine has been heavily criticised after more than 700 people onboard tested positive for the virus. Here\u2019s video of what Hancock said about shutting down cities in the UK. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said it may be necessary to follow China\u2019s example by shutting down cities to prevent the spread of coronavirus. He also confirmed plans to bring doctors and nurses out of retirement if the outbreak escalates in the UK. A man who has tested positive for coronavirus in Shenzhen, China, travelled there after flying into Hong Kong from London. The 35-year-old man had been working in the UK, according to local reports. Iran has said its death toll from coronavirus has reached 54 and the number of infected cases is 978. It comes just days after the ministry categorically denied reports 50 people had died from the disease. A top Italian health official has warned of a \u201ctsunami\u201d effect on the hospital system as confirmed coronavirus cases in Italy rose to 1,128. The number killed by the virus in Italy has increased to 29. The authorities in France have announced the number of confirmed cases has jumped to 100, with two deaths. The country has banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people. The number of confirmed cases in Spain has increased to 73. A fifth person has tested positive for the virus at the hotel in Tenerife that has been locked down after four other people staying there were diagnosed with coronavirus. Australia, Thailand and the US have all both reported their country\u2019s first deaths from the virus. Japan reported its second death on Sunday \u2013 a man in his 70s on the island of Hokkaido. Two more doctors have died in China and the country\u2019s death tally has risen by 35 to 2,870. Infections have risen 573 to 79,824 (of which 41,825, or 52%, are listed as recovered). Labour is calling on Matt Hancock to fully explain the emergency powers the government is planning in response to a coronavirus outbreak in a Commons update on Monday. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \u201cThere are growing concerns about our part-time prime minister\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and serious questions about capacity in our overstretched NHS. \u201cThe health secretary should come to the Commons on Monday to explain fully the emergency powers he is planning to bring in, and to update MPs on the government\u2019s response so that we can properly scrutinise it.\u201d Iran\u2019s health ministry has said the death toll from coronavirus has now reached 54 as the number of infected cases jumped overnight to 978. It comes days after the ministry categorically denied reports that 50 people had died from the disease. AP reports: The ministry\u2019s spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said new cases were confirmed in a number of cities, including Mashhad, which is home to Iran\u2019s most important Shia shrine that attracts pilgrims from across the region. Calls by Iran\u2019s civilian government to clerics to close such shrines to to the public have not been uniformly followed. The shrine in Mashhad is among those that have remained open. The new figures represent 11 more deaths than reported on Saturday and 385 new cases of infections. Health experts have warned that based on the known mortality rate of Covid-19, the number of confirmed cases is likely to be much higher than the Iranian authorities are reporting. A parent and child who attended the minor injuries unit at Sevenoaks hospital in Kent on Saturday afternoon have been advised to self-isolate at home and call NHS 111 in case they require testing for the coronavirus. The parent grew concerned when the child, who had been at school with pupils who recently returned from Italy, developed a mild temperature. As a precautionary measure, Sevenoaks hospital closed the minor injuries unit at 6.30pm on Saturday, about 90 minutes early. Existing patients continued with their treatment as normal. The unit was deep-cleaned overnight, as a further precaution, and opened as usual on Sunday morning. The rest of the hospital was unaffected. The Department of Health and Social Security did not provide further details on whether the child had been tested or was awaiting a test. A \u201csurveillance network\u201d of GP practices in Scotland will test patients with coughs and fevers and submit samples, even if patients have not travelled to an area affected by coronavirus, as part of the Scottish government plans. The measure was described as an \u201cearly warning\u201d system to alert health professionals to the possible spread of the virus. The chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said: \u201cHospitals and GP surgeries will now conduct tests on some patients with coughs, fevers or shortness of breath \u2013 regardless of whether they have travelled to a place where the virus is known to be spreading. \u201cNot everyone with flu will be tested, but this is a sensible step to take as a precautionary measure to give us an early warning of community transmission.\u201d A \u201cdrive through\u201d testing centre for coronavirus has also opened at the Western General hospital, Edinburgh, where patients with appointments can be tested for the virus in their cars. The Scottish government also announced that in the coming days it will jointly publish an updated action plan with the UK government, as well as the welsh and Northern Irish administrations, outlining the steps that will be taken to manage coronavirus if there is a sustained epidemic. A top Italian health official has warned of a \u201ctsunami\u201d effect on the hospital system as confirmed coronavirus cases in Italy rose to 1,128. \u201cThe situation is, frankly, an emergency from the point of view of health system organisation,\u201d Massimo Galli, a professor and director of infectious diseases at Milan\u2019s Sacco hospital, told Corriere della Sera on Sunday. \u201cIt is the equivalent of a tsunami for the number of patients with major diseases being hospitalised all together. For example, on Friday, before the new wave of cases arrived in Lombardy, there were 85 beds occupied by patients intubated for Covid-19, that\u2019s a significant share of those available.\u201d Authorities in the Lombardy region, where 552 people are infected, have asked for a hospital to be made available solely for treating coronavirus and to be able to hire retired doctors and nurses to help with the workload. There have been 29 deaths in Italy, the latest eight victims ranging between the ages of 79 and 90. Those who have died so far were suffering other serious health problems. Some 401 people have been hospitalised \u2013 105 of them in intensive care \u2013 and 543 are at home. Fifty people have recovered. Schools in Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, where there are 213 cases, and Veneto, where there 189, will be closed for another week. The virus has spread to 11 out of 20 Italian regions over the past week, wreaking havoc on the country\u2019s already fragile economy. The financial hub of Milan is endeavouring to return to normal, reopening museums and its famous Duomo, but the city was dealt a further blow after American Airlines announced it was suspending flights to Milan following the US State Department raising it travel warning for parts of Italy. Other airlines have also scrapped or reduced flights due to low demand for travel to Italy. On Friday, the government announced financial relief for those living in 11 towns still under lockdown, businesses and the tourism sector while new measures worth \u20ac3.6bn to help the economy withstand the worst outbreak of coronavirus in Europe, and the third worst in the world, will be introduced this week, finance minister Roberto Gualtieri told La Repubblica on Sunday. A man who has tested positive for coronavirus in Shenzhen, travelled there after flying into Hong Kong from London on Thursday, according to local reports. The news site Caixin reported that a 35-year-old man who had been working in the UK flew from London to Hong Kong on 27 February and arrived at noon on 28 February. He then took a ferry to Shekou, near Shenzhen and then drove to Shenzen, it reported. On Saturday he developed symptoms of a cough and fever and went to the hospital where he was confirmed positive for the virus, it said. He is being treated in isolation in a hospital in Shenzhen. According to documents seen by Caixin, health authorities in Shenzhen notified provincial officials in Guangdong as well as health authorities in Hong Kong on Sunday. 1. The public broadcaster RTHK reported that the Centre for Health Protection is appealing to anyone who travelled business class on Cathay Pacific flight CX250 from London to Hong Kong on Friday to get in touch. It said it had received notice from Guangdong authorities that a passenger on that flight was confirmed to have Covid-19. The health authorities in France have announced the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country has jumped to 100 as the government took measures to limit the spread of the virus. Of the reported cases so far, two people have died, 86 are in hospital - nine of whom are in a \u201cserious\u201d condition - and 12 people have recovered. The number of contaminations has leapt in France from 38 on Friday. Three health workers at a Paris hospital have tested positive for the coronavirus, as well as a firefighter in Rennes. In the Haute-Savoie region, where there has been a cluster of cases thought to have originated from a person who had returned from northern Italy , the mayor of La Balme-de-Sillingy, Fran\u00e7ois Daviet announced he had tested positive. France has banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people in \u201cconfined spaces\u201d and outside demonstrations in areas where the virus has been reported. Today\u2019s Paris half marathon is cancelled as well as the last day of the Agriculture Salon and the carnival at Annecy. However some sporting events going ahead. Around 2,000 schoolchildren are in self-imposed quarantine at home following advice from health officials to those who visited infected areas during the half term holidays to stay away from classes. Priests in some dioceses, including Paris, have been instructed not to put the \u2018host\u2019 into communicants\u2019 mouths but in their hands. Air France has imposed a freeze on hiring new staff and announced cost-cutting measures last week to offset the economic impact of the virus on the travel industry. People over 6o and those with underlying health conditions should try to avoid \u201ccrowded areas\u201d and \u201cplaces where you might interact with people who are sick\u201d, according to the head of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Spain now has 73 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to the head of the country\u2019s Centre for the Coordination of Health Emergencies and Alerts. Speaking on Sunday morning, Fernando Sim\u00f3n said that 90% of the cases were imported or related to imported cases of the virus, adding that Spain would not be raising its alert level for the time being. Nor, he said, would it be enacting the drastic measures seen in France and Italy. A fifth person has tested positive for the virus at the hotel in Tenerife that has been locked down after four other people staying there were diagnosed with the coronavirus. The Italian national, part of the same group as the four original cases at the island\u2019s H10 Costa Adeje Palace Hotel, is now in hospital. The Canary Islands\u2019 regional health authorities said the man had been in isolation in a hotel room since 24 February and was \u201cin good state of health\u201d. Meanwhile, it appears that Ecuador\u2019s first case of the virus could have originated in Spain after a 70-year-old Ecuadorian woman living in Spain tested positive for the virus after flying from Madrid to Ecuador\u2019s second city, Guayaquil, on 14 February. According to Ecuadorian health authorities, the woman showed no symptoms of the illness on the flight. The American Physical Society has announced the cancellation of one of the world\u2019s major international scientific conferences, little more than a day before it was due to start. An announcement on its website said: \u201cDue to rapidly escalating health concerns relating to the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the 2020 APS March Meeting in Denver, Colorado, has been canceled. Please do not travel to Denver to attend the March Meeting.\u201d Around 10,000 physicists and scientists from around the world were due to attend the conference this week, and the late cancellation has caught many overseas delegates in the middle of travelling. Isolating UK cities, as the Chinese authorities did to Wuhan where coronavirus was first detected, may be necessary to stop the the spread of the outbreak, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has conceded. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Hancock also confirmed that the NHS was planning to bring doctors out of retirement if the coronavirus becomes more widespread. Marr asked Hancock: \u201cChina, of course, isolated entire cities. Is it conceivable under any circumstance, you try and cut off the city in this country?\u201d Hancock replied: \u201cThere\u2019s clearly a huge economic and social downside to that. But we don\u2019t take anything off the table at this stage, because you\u2019ve got to make sure that you have all the tools available, if that is what\u2019s necessary. But I want to minimise the social and economic disruption.\u201d He said the government would be publishing its battle plan for the measures it would take under a worst case scenario for the outbreak. He said: \u201cIt may be necessary to close some schools, but right now, people should not be closing schools if there isn\u2019t a positive case.\u201d Hancock confirmed that other \u201cpopulation distancing measures\u201d could include banning public gatherings of more than 5,000 people as the French government has announced. He said: \u201cWe are looking at all those sorts of things, we do not rule them out.\u201d Asked if retired doctors and nurses would be asked to come out of retirement, Hancock said: \u201cWe may do. That isn\u2019t something we need right now. But the big challenge for the NHS in the event of this becoming widespread here is NHS staff themselves not being able to come to work because they\u2019re because they\u2019re ill or they\u2019re self-isolating. So it\u2019s about having the people available.\u201d He also played down a report in the Guardian that England only has 15 available beds for adults to treat the most severe respiratory failure. He said: \u201cI saw those figures published in the Guardian and they are wrong and out of date. We have 50 now, and we can ramp that up to 500. And then if necessary 5,000 beds that are able to cope with the worst impact of this virus but of course. Hancock also confirmed that non-emergency surgery, including hip and knee replacements, may be cancelled. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that. But these have to be clinical decisions. Clinicians have to make decisions about what is the most important and effective use of NHS resources. They do this all the time.\u201d Hancock also denied Labour claims Boris Johnson was shirking his responsibility by delaying chairing a Cobra emergency committee on the outbreak until Monday. He told Sky: The prime minister has been all over this. I have daily calls with him often more than once a day. And I\u2019ve been updating cabinet weekly. I\u2019ve been chairing those Cobra meetings across government \u2013 a case of ministers and officials working incredibly well together. And the prime minister is fully on top of all of this, and and that\u2019s the way it should be. Last week he did a night shift at a hospital to find out what it\u2019s really like on the frontline at two o\u2019clock in the morning. I applaud him for doing that Clearly, I\u2019m leading the operational response and working incredibly closely with him and every other member of the government. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the government is considering \u201call options\u201d for tackling the spread of coronavirus. Speaking on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge programme, he described the outbreak as \u201ca very, very significant challenge\u201d. He said: \u201cWe are planning in case this gets much worse\u201d. Hancock insisted ministers would put the safety of people first, but they did not want to unnecessarily hit the economy and society. He said: We\u2019re considering all options. At the moment the number of cases in this country is 23. And that means that so long as people are washing hands and taking the precautions that are set out that is the right thing to do. We don\u2019t rule out taking any of these other measures. We will advice on those measures when it is right to take them because we want to minimise the economic and social disruption subject to keeping people safe. It\u2019s a balancing act, where I place the greatest weight on keeping people safe. But there\u2019s no point in doing things that aren\u2019t clinically effective. We have to be guided by the science. He added: The plan is very clear, firstly, to contain this virus, that\u2019s the stage we\u2019re in now. It means that every single case that is found here gets immediate treatment, but also we contact all of the people that that person has been in close contact with. Largely most of the cases so far, are from people who\u2019ve caught the virus elsewhere and brought it here, and we\u2019re then able to contain it. We\u2019ve put \u00a340m into trying to find a vaccine and also trying to improve the treatments for people who do have the disease. The experts say that a vaccine, even accelerated as fast as possible, is still many months off. But the potential for treatments that make the virus less of a problem if you\u2019ve got it, they are more optimistic. The final plan is to prepare for mitigation should this become endemic in this country and making sure that not only the NHS is prepared, but also all parts of society. The government has got a huge role to play, but so does every single person. At the moment, the best thing people can do is make sure that they wash their hands for 20 seconds or more. We\u2019re telling children that you\u2019ve got to wash your hands whilst you sing happy birthday to make sure that gets through very simply. If we get to a position where this is much more widespread, then of course we\u2019re we we will change the advice to deal with that. There\u2019s a danger to doing things too early because they wouldn\u2019t be effective. We are looking at every single option \u2026 with a clear battle plan for how we rise to the challenge of this. Hancock noted that stopping all flights from China, as pushed by some, had not proved successful for Italy, which is the worst affected country in Europe. Kuwait has confirmed a new case of coronavirus infection, bringing the total number of people diagnosed with the disease in the country to 46, a health ministry official told a press conference on Sunday, Reuters reports. The majority of the cases, including the one identified in the past 24 hours, are either people who had travelled to Iran or been in contact with people who were there, the official said. For the first time, Japan\u2019s professional baseball teams staged pre-season opening games behind closed doors after the country dramatically escalated its response to coronavirus by closing schools and cancelling mass events. The condition of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman detained in Iran, is getting \u201cworse and worse\u201d but the Iranian authorities are still refusing to test her for coronavirus, her family has said. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Richard said his wife\u2019s guards were \u201ckeeping away\u201d from her in case she has caught the disease. He said her \u201ccold like symptoms that have got worse and worse and they\u2019re not going away\u201d. He said: \u201cI\u2019m sure the prison is not testing partly because there\u2019s not many testing kits and partly because they don\u2019t want to know\u201d. The US, Australia and Thailand have reported their first deaths from coronavirus as two frontline doctors in China died and more countries put in place bans on large gatherings and travel restrictions. A 35-year-old male retail worker in Thailand died from Covid-19, according to the country\u2019s department of disease control on Sunday. The man had also tested positive for dengue fever. In Australia, a 78-year-old man who was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship died in a hospital in western Australia. His wife has also contracted the virus. On Saturday, US officials said a man in his 50s in Washington state had died, after being tested for the disease on Thursday. Authorities said they did not know how he had contracted the virus because he did not have any history of travel to affected areas or contact with known Covid-19 cases. On Sunday, China reported its sharpest increase in new infections in a week with 573 new cases, the highest daily rise in a week. Chinese health authorities reported 35 new deaths on Sunday, a drop from the previous day\u2019s toll of 47. A 32-year old doctor named Zhong Jinxing in the southern province of Guangxi who reportedly died from \u201coverwork\u201d on Friday after working for 33 consecutive days. Another doctor, Jiang Xueqing, 55, died on Sunday after having been infected with Covid-19, according to Chinese state media. Good morning from London, where the main news is that former health professionals could be brought out of retirement under emergency plans to combat the spread of coronavirus. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is expected to give more details about the plans in a round of Sunday morning broadcast interviews. It comes after a further three people in England tested positive for the virus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 23. Two of the patients had recently travelled back from Italy, while the other had returned from Asia, according to the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. Thailand has reported its first death from the virus - a 35-year-old retail worker who was also diagnosed with dengue fever. Japan reported its second death on Sunday - a man in his 70s on the island of Hokkaido. Australia recorded its first Covid-19 death on Sunday \u2013 a 78-year-old man who had been a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. He died in Perth and his wife is infected with the virus. The US has recorded its first death from Covid-19. A man in his 50s in Washington state, who had underlying health issues but with no travel history to affected areas. Two more doctors have died in China and the country\u2019s death tally has risen by 35 to 2,870. Infections have risen 573 to 79,824 (of which 41,825, or 52%, are listed as recovered). A second person in Australia has tested positive to the virus after returning from Iran. The government imposed travel restrictions on passengers coming from Iran. South Korea has recorded 376 more Covid-19 cases, taking the country\u2019s total to 3,526. Seventeen people have died. France and Italy have imposed strict bans on public gatherings. Ireland reported its first case of the virus, as did Ecuador, Luxembourg and Armenia. China has reported 573 new confirmed cases and 35 deaths. World stock markets are expected to fall further next week, after reports indicated China\u2019s factory output had plunged and the country\u2019s service sectors have contracted.

All cases are linked to recent travel to Italy. The woman, from northern Coahuila, was not showing symptoms. She had recently traveled to Milan. An alarming story from our Beijing correspondent, Lily Kuo, on citizen journalist Li Zehua who is missing, presumed detained. He\u2019s one of many for whom the coronavirus crisis has led to a political awakening and a demand for free speech. \u201cI don\u2019t want to remain silent, or shut my eyes and ears. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t have a nice life, with a wife and kids. I can. I\u2019m doing this because I hope more young people can, like me, stand up,\u201d he says. The live stream, posted on Weibo, where it was later deleted, and on YouTube, shows two men in plain clothes entering the apartment and then cuts out. An interesting report from Reuters, about Indonesia, which continues to say it has seen no cases, despite some infections around the world linked to travel to or through Bali: Indonesia has the resources to cope with a coronavirus outbreak, the director of its leading infectious diseases hospital said, defending detection procedures in the Southeast Asian nation of more than 260 million, where no cases have been reported. The world\u2019s fourth most populous nation has tested 141 suspected cases, a small figure for its population, sparking concern among some medical professionals of a lack of vigilance and a risk of undetected cases. Neighbouring Malaysia has reportedly run about 1,000 tests, and Britain more than 10,000. \u201cWe can\u2019t doubt our skills and the facts we gather,\u201d said Muhammad Syahril, director of the Sulianti Saroso hospital in Jakarta, the capital, when asked why Indonesia had detected no cases. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have cases, we don\u2019t have cases,\u201d he said in an interview at the hospital on Friday. \u201cWhy would we cover it up?\u201d Reuters: A man in his 70s died on Japan\u2019s northernmost island of Hokkaido on Saturday night after testing positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, local authorities said on Sunday. The municipal government of Hokkaido said the patient was hospitalised on Jan. 17 for another disease, but started to show flu-like symptoms a few weeks later and tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb. 25. Public broadcaster NHK and other local media said authorities suspect the man may have caught the virus while in hospital. The man\u2019s death marks the sixth fatality from Covid-19 in Japan, excluding six deaths among those aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess. The coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong has not reached its peak yet, he Dean of the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Faculty of Medicine, Professor Gabriel Leung, warned on Sunday. RTHK reports Leung said it was too soon to tell when the outbreak would be end, and people should remain vigilant. \u201cThe rest of the world actually views Hong Kong, along with Singapore, as the gold standard in epidemic control,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at these two places, we have very similar absolute numbers of confirmed cases, yet we have a population that is one third bigger then Singapore, so - on a per capita basis - we\u2019re not doing too badly.\u201d Hong Kong has reported 95 cases and two deaths. Samsung Electronics has closed one of its factories in South Korea, according to Yonhap news agency. The mobile device factory in Gumni, near Davey, was closed after a worker tested positive for the coronavirus. It has been closed for a short time last month after an earlier case was discovered. From Reuters: Churches were closed in South Korea on Sunday with many holding online services instead, as authorities fought to rein in public gatherings, with 376 new coronavirus infections taking the tally to 3,526 cases. That came a day after the biggest daily jump of 813 cases in South Korea\u2019s battle with the largest virus outbreak outside China, said the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), which will update numbers later in the day. The death toll of 17 was unchanged from Saturday, it added. In Seoul, the capital, about a dozen worshippers were turned away from the Yoido Full Gospel Church, which put a sermon for its 560,000 followers on YouTube, filmed with a small choir instead of all 200 members and 60-strong orchestra. \u201cI had heard there would be no service, but just came to check as I live nearby, but yes, it is so empty,\u201d said one of them, Song Young-koo, as he left South Korea\u2019s biggest church. \u201cIt\u2019s a wise decision to do it online, since the virus would easily spread at mass gatherings and churches can be no exception.\u201d Some more details on that death in Thailand. Dr. Teerawat Hemachutha, Thiravat Hemachudha, Head of Emerging Disease Health Science Center Faculty of Medicine Chulalongkorn Hospital, the Thai Red Cross, posted on Facebook earlier today that the victim was a 35-year-old male retail worker who also tested positive to dengue fever. Citing an unnamed health official, Reuters is reporting that Thailand has seen its first Covid-19 death. I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleague, Helen Davidson, shortly, but before that, here\u2019s a summary of the top points so far. Australia recorded its first Covid-19 death on Sunday \u2013 a 78-year-old man who had been a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. He died in Perth and his wife is infected with the virus. The US also recorded its first death, a man in his 50s from Seattle who had underlying medical issues. Washington state\u2019s governor declared a state of emergency. The man had no history of travel to affected areas or contact with a known COVID-19 case Two more doctors have died in China and the country\u2019s death tally has risen by 35 to 2,870. Infections have risen 573 to 79,824 (of which 41,825, or 52%, are listed as recovered). South Korea has recorded 376 more Covid-19 cases, taking the country\u2019s total to 3,526. Seventeen people have died. WHO has raised the global risk level to \u201cvery high\u201d over coronavirus. Thailand reports 42nd case of Covid-19. Armenia has reported its first case of Covid-19. Thailand now has 42 cases of Covid-19, after a 21-year-old man tested positive on Saturday, the Bangkok Post reports. Sukhum Kanchanaphimai, the permanent secretary for public health, said the man\u2019s job brought him into contact with foreign tourists and he fell ill on 24 February, before seeking treatment the following day. He\u2019s currently in hospital in Bangkok. The country has not reported any deaths from the virus but, as of Sunday, authorities will have greater powers to act after the Public Health Ministry designated Covid-19 a dangerous communicable disease. Tourism in many parts of Thailand has suffered, with travellers curtailing their journeys amid fears of the virus\u2019s spread. American Airlines will suspend all US flights to Milan. It announced the move just hours after the US State Department said it was raising its travel warning for parts of Italy due to the coronavirus outbreak to Level 4 or \u201cdo not travel\u201d. This covers travel to Lombardy and Veneto, in Italy\u2019s north. American said it will suspend flights to and from Milan, from New York-JFK and Miami until 24 April, citing a reduction in demand. Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the US response to the virus, said on Saturday that the State Department will work with Italy to coordinate medical screening of any individuals coming to the United States. Chinese state media is reporting that a doctor \u2013 32-year-old Zhong Jinxing \u2013 has died \u201cfrom overwork\u201d. The People\u2019s Daily repots that another doctor, Jiang Xueqing, 55, also died on Sunday. I\u2019m just doubling back on those Chinese figures announced today, that I mentioned at the start of the blog. Another 35 deaths were reported on Sunday, and 573 new confirmed cases. Of the deaths, all but one were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. All but three of the new confirmed cases were also in Hubei. The total confirmed cases in China is 79,824, of which 41,825 (or 52%) are listed as recovered, and a total of 2,870 deaths have been recorded. Based on those figures, the case fatality rate for Covid-19 is 3.6%, which is something Chinese state media is also reporting. However, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that there is a direct link between deaths and the number of cases reported in calculating that rate, so if people are having mild symptoms and don\u2019t go through the testing process, there\u2019s a likelihood that the eventual rate case fatality rate will be lower. We will only know this in hindsight. You may have seen reports last week that a dog in Hong Kong had tested \u201cweak positive\u201d to Covid-19. Experts in the UK told the Guardian they thought it was unlikely to be an actual infection, and that one possible explanation was that a dog had produced a false positive test as a result of close contact with a human who had the virus, or from coming in contact with the virus via touch. The dog showed no relevant symptoms of the virus authorities said and Hong Kong health authorities advised that it had no evidence that pets can be infected with Covid-19 or a source of the infection. But a spokesman from the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), said: \u201cTo ensure public and animal health, the department strongly advise mammalian pets of patients confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19 virus to be put under quarantine by the AFCD.\u201d The WHO says it is working with its partner agencies for human/animal health and is \u201cwaiting for further tests from Hong Kong\u201d, but the WHO boss, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said past experience with coronavirus and \u201cour current understanding of Covid-19 does not indicated that common household pets spread the disease or make people sick\u201d. If you\u2019re just catching up with the latest news on the virus, outbreak, a reminder that the World Health Organization has raised the risk assessment \u201cvery high\u201d globally. It also said the risk within #China remains unchanged as \u201cvery high.\u201d The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the risk level had been elevated for two reasons difficulty in identifying cases due to non-specific symptoms &amp; the potential of undetected transmission potential for major impact on healthcare systems in some affected &amp; potentially affected countries. The WHO also released virus advice on the social media app, TikTok, in an effort it said to beat the \u201cinfodemic\u201d. South Korea has recorded 376 more Covid-19 cases, taking the country\u2019s total to 3,526. Seventeen people have died. Of the 376 new cases, 333 were in Daegu, 300km southeast of Seoul, which has been at the centre of the outbreak linked to the. Shincheonji Church of Jesus. The Yonhap agency says there were also 26 new cases reported in neighbouring North Gyeongsang Province. As of Sunday morning, South Korea was carrying out tests on 32,422 people nationwide, while 61,037 people have tested negative in total. Still on Australia, and on Sunday, the country\u2019s Home Affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said it was not possible to extend travel bans to all countries affected by the coronavirus outbreak, but he defended Australia\u2019s decision to restrict entry to people who had travelled from Iran, but not South Korea, which has many more cases. \u201cIf you look at the underreporting or the lack of reporting coming out of Iran ... there was a real concern as to whether they had a handle on the numbers,\u201d Dutton said, adding that South Korea has a more advanced health system. We are hearing a news conference from Australia, where officials have confirmed that a Western Australian man has confirmed the country\u2019s first death from Covid-19. Dr Andrew Robertson, Western Australia\u2019s chief health officer, confirms that the man travelled back to Australia from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. The man was diagnosed in the Howard Springs quarantine facility outside Darwin 9 or 10 days ago. The man, in his late 70s, passed away in the early hours of Sunday morning in intensive care in a West Australian hospital. His wife is also infected with Covid-19. Robertson who is giving the news conference, has confirmed that there is still no community transmission in Australia. The man\u2019s wife is in isolation in hospital and being monitored. Robertson is asked what Australians can do to protect themselves from the virus. He says handwashing is important but also says people should consider getting the flu shot this year. We are getting unconfirmed reports that an Australian man has died in Western Australia from Covid-19 \u2013 the country\u2019s first fatality. We are waiting for official confirmation, but media reports say he is a 78-year-old passenger from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, and was one of the 164 Australians to be repatriated from the ship around two weeks ago. We will bring you confirmation on this as soon as we have it \u2013 we are expecting a news conference shortly. First to the US where the first death from Covid-19 has been recorded. The man was in his 50s and had underlying health issues. He died at a hospital in Kirkland, near Seattle. Officials are unsure how he was exposed to the virus. Washington state has two other presumed cases at a long-term care facility in Kirkland where more than 50 residents and staff could be showing symptoms, according to Jeffrey Duchin, head of the Washington health department\u2019s communicable disease unit. \u201cAt this point we do not have widespread community-wide transmission locally. We have transmission that\u2019s associated with an outbreak at this long-term care facility,\u201d Duchin said. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. Before we get underway with this blog, here are the main points making news right now. The US has recorded its first death from Covid-19. A man in his 50s in Washington state, who had underlying health issues but with no travel history to affected areas. A second person in Australia has tested positive to the virus after returning from Iran. The government imposed travel restrictions on passengers coming from Iran. France and Italy have imposed strict bans on public gatherings. Ireland reported its first case of the virus, as did Ecuador and Luxembourg. China has reported 573 new confirmed cases and 35 deaths. World stock markets are expected to fall further next week, after reports indicated China\u2019s factory output had plunged and the country\u2019s service sectors have contracted.

The S&amp;P/ASX200 index was 144.2 points down at the start of trade on Monday. The decline means the ASX has now gone down over 10% in the last seven trading days. The Australian dollar was at its lowest point in a decade on Monday morning, buying 64.69 US cents. It came after a spike in coronavirus cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea over the weekend, and the first confirmed deaths from the virus in the United States and Australia. IG market analyst Kyle Rodda said the biggest impact would come from the latest PMI surveys from China. \u201cThe data [shows] business activity in the Chinese economy fell to an all-time low last month.\u201d Among the biggest drops at the opening of trade were Bega down 10% and Fortescue down 9.92%. As economic uncertainty grows in Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia were set to meet on Tuesday ahead of an announcement on interest rates. Australian National University\u2019s shadow RBA \u2013 a group of experts who analyse Reserve Bank policy \u2013 has said the official cash rate should remain at 0.75% \u201cFears about a global coronavirus pandemic are already taking their toll on world financial markets and are likely to impose significant economic costs on the Australian economy, should the crisis worsen,\u201d RBA shadow board chair Timo Henckel said. \u201cThe fear surrounding this crisis has clearly battered financial markets worldwide although the likely cost to the Australian economy remains highly uncertain,\u201d Henckel said. A survey of 39 experts and economists by Finder reported that while 90% of the experts predict another rate cut this year, just 15% believe the cut will come on Tuesday. Last week almost $200bn was wiped from the stockmarket after a week of falls.",

It\u2019s also increasingly clear that this modus operandi is being led by No 10 and those around the prime minister,\u201d he said. Rutnam quit on Saturday after accusing Patel of orchestrating a \u201cvicious\u201d campaign against him, of lying about her involvement in it and of creating a climate of fear in her department. He plans to take his case to an employment tribunal, which could call Patel, Johnson and Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s chief aide, as witnesses. Amid mounting pressure upon the home secretary to step down, the BBC claimed that another formal complaint about Patel was made when she was an employment minister at the Department for Work and Pensions between 2015 and 2016. The alleged complaint was made by a member of her private office \u2013 a team of six to eight civil servants that works closely with an individual minister. A spokesman for Patel did not respond to a request for a comment from the Guardian. Patel could well face questions in parliament about her behaviour. The Labour leadership candidate Keir Starmer called on the home secretary to address the explosive allegations when parliament resumes on Monday. \u201cThe home secretary has a duty to come to parliament on Monday to explain the allegations made about her own conduct,\u201d Starmer said. He has also called for the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, to launch an immediate investigation into the circumstances surrounding Rutnam\u2019s departure. Asked if Patel could stay in post, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge programme: \u201cI can\u2019t see it, it\u2019s bizarre.\u201d The row comes two weeks after Sajid Javid quit as chancellor when Johnson ordered him to fire his team of aides.

It has been loaned a handful of times over the past 100 years to exhibitions but is thought never to have been on public display in the abbey itself.</p> <p>\u201cIt is one of the finest works of art which the abbey has,\u201d said curator Susan Jenkins. \u201cWe are very excited.\u201d</p> <p>The 1749 painting, <a href=\"https://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canalett/7/canal711.html\">Westminster Abbey with a procession of the Knights of the Bath</a>, is the earliest work of art to depict the abbey\u2019s famous west towers, which were completed in 1745.</p> <p>The knights were a military order revived by George I in 1725 and its members were the great and good of Britain\u2019s armed forces. Every four years they have a ceremony if there is a new knight to be installed, and in the 18th century they would process from the abbey to to the Prince\u2019s Chamber in parliament.</p> <p>It is that arcane scene which Canaletto has painted. Jenkins said: \u201cIt\u2019s beautifully painted and I always think the more you know about it, the more fascinating the painting it is.\u201d</p> <p>For example, in the doorway of the abbey is a table behind which the sovereign\u2019s master cook stands, wearing an apron and brandishing a chopping knife.</p> <p>His job, according to an account in the London Gazette, was to say to each of the knights processing past: \u201cSir! You know what great oath you have taken, which if you keep it will be a great honour to you, but if you break it I shall be compelled, by my office, to hack off your spurs from your heel.\u201d</p> <p>The painting was commissioned by Joseph Wilcocks, the dean of Westminster, and was bequeathed to the Abbey by his son in 1792. </p> <p>Planned refurbishment of the deanery and the opening of purpose-built gallery spaces in 2018 has now allowed the abbey to put one of its jewels on public display.</p> <p>Jenkins said there would have been drummers and trumpeters playing at the 1749 procession and the painting conveys that sense of spectacle and excitement.</p> <p>\u201cI love the fact that the people watching the scenes in 1749 are very like now, the abbey has always been a place which drew crowds and put on wonderful spectacles. [It] still has that national focus.</p> <p>\u201cIt is beautifully painted and it is almost as if you are hovering above in a drone, your focus is on the top of the towers but you\u2019re aware of this great red procession going on. It lifts your spirits up.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/13/new-exhibition-of-canalettos-british-paintings-at-compton-verney-gallery\">Canaletto remains one of the most celebrated painters of the 18th century.</a> Mainly known for his pictures of Venice, he lived in England during 1746-55 and painted many London views, the majority of which were bought by George III and remain in the Royal Collection.</p> <p>\u2022 Westminster Abbey with a procession of the Knights of the Bath will be on display from 5 March until autumn 2020 in the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee Galleries.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A spectacular but rarely seen Canaletto painting of Westminster Abbey is to go on public display in the building it depicts for probably the first time in more than two centuries. Since 1792 it has hung in the the private living and entertaining quarters of the dean. It has been loaned a handful of times over the past 100 years to exhibitions but is thought never to have been on public display in the abbey itself. \u201cIt is one of the finest works of art which the abbey has,\u201d said curator Susan Jenkins. \u201cWe are very excited.\u201d The 1749 painting, Westminster Abbey with a procession of the Knights of the Bath, is the earliest work of art to depict the abbey\u2019s famous west towers, which were completed in 1745. The knights were a military order revived by George I in 1725 and its members were the great and good of Britain\u2019s armed forces. Every four years they have a ceremony if there is a new knight to be installed, and in the 18th century they would process from the abbey to to the Prince\u2019s Chamber in parliament. It is that arcane scene which Canaletto has painted. Jenkins said: \u201cIt\u2019s beautifully painted and I always think the more you know about it, the more fascinating the painting it is.\u201d For example, in the doorway of the abbey is a table behind which the sovereign\u2019s master cook stands, wearing an apron and brandishing a chopping knife. His job, according to an account in the London Gazette, was to say to each of the knights processing past: \u201cSir! You know what great oath you have taken, which if you keep it will be a great honour to you, but if you break it I shall be compelled, by my office, to hack off your spurs from your heel.\u201d The painting was commissioned by Joseph Wilcocks, the dean of Westminster, and was bequeathed to the Abbey by his son in 1792. Planned refurbishment of the deanery and the opening of purpose-built gallery spaces in 2018 has now allowed the abbey to put one of its jewels on public display. Jenkins said there would have been drummers and trumpeters playing at the 1749 procession and the painting conveys that sense of spectacle and excitement. \u201cI love the fact that the people watching the scenes in 1749 are very like now, the abbey has always been a place which drew crowds and put on wonderful spectacles. [It] still has that national focus. \u201cIt is beautifully painted and it is almost as if you are hovering above in a drone, your focus is on the top of the towers but you\u2019re aware of this great red procession going on. It lifts your spirits up.\u201d Canaletto remains one of the most celebrated painters of the 18th century. Mainly known for his pictures of Venice, he lived in England during 1746-55 and painted many London views, the majority of which were bought by George III and remain in the Royal Collection. \u2022 Westminster Abbey with a procession of the Knights of the Bath will be on display from 5 March until autumn 2020 in the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee Galleries.",

Even before Bloomberg began speaking, it was clear his presence at the black church, which was the epicenter of the civil rights movement in Selma, was controversial. Pastor Leodis Strong prefaced the mayor\u2019s speech by saying that when he first invited Bloomberg, he rebuffed the invitation only to later change his mind. \u201cIt shows a willingness on his part to change,\u201d Strong said, adding that he wanted Bloomberg to come to Selma to listen to people. But several in the audience could be heard whispering in contempt \u2013 referencing the stop-and-frisk policing policy he pursued in New York and his immense wealth. One of the people who turned his back to the mayor was Ryan Haygood, president and chief executive of the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice. As Bloomberg spoke, Haygood said, he thought about the kind of police brutality the civil rights organizers faced in the chapel 55 years ago as they protested for equal voting rights.

Biden and Warren were fresh off the South Carolina primary, which Biden won handily, confirming his strength with the black community.

      "body": "<p>\u2018I\u2019m here for two years, tops, so don\u2019t get attached to me,\u201d says DCI Lauren McDonald (Tala Gouveia) at the start of McDonald and Dodds (ITV). Which is no way to launch a TV cop franchise, but still. \u201cBut, while I\u2019m here, I\u2019m gonna solve cases in half the time with half the manpower.\u201d Talking about it won\u2019t make it happen.</p> <p>Imagine Simon Pegg from Hot Fuzz as a crime-solving woman of colour with sarcastic eyebrows and you\u2019ll get the picture. McDonald has been transferred from south London\u2019s mean streets to Bath, a city where the worst crimes are usually the prices for cream teas.</p> <p>Well, not quite. There\u2019s a corpse at a millionaire\u2019s mansion, plugged with two slugs from a military-issue sidearm. Despite the panama hat and expensive shirt, the vic had prison tats and a rap sheet as long as the elegant Regency staircase down which he fell to his death.</p> <p>The mansion is owned by Robert Lindsay\u2019s oleaginous entrepreneur, Max Crockett. He made a \u00a330m fortune from making steam irons which, as one cop puts it, are \u201cthe best things to come out of Bath since Plasticine\u201d. Plasticine was indeed invented in Bath by William Harbutt. No, not William Hardbutt. He invented chair cushions.</p> <p>Crockett is planning to retire. But to which of his three daughters will he leave his fortune? If the premise sounds like King Lear or Succession, let me say this: Brian Cox didn\u2019t give anything away in Succession. And is Crockett\u2019s artisanal-baker daughter, Ellie, who does such a good Cordelia impression all she seems? Not if I know my crime dramas she isn\u2019t.</p> <p>Whodunnit? \u201cMost murder victims are killed by a member of their own family,\u201d McDonald tells the Crocketts. \u201cMaybe where you come from. But not here,\u201d scoffs Crockett\u2019s Goneril-like daughter, Megan, who is not only vice-chair of Bath\u2019s police oversight committee, but the answer to the question: \u201cWho ate all the lemons?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re nice, middle-class people who go glamping,\u201d says her no-less-citrus-filled barrister husband. \u201cWe play boules at the weekend. Where are we going to get a firearm?\u201d</p> <p>McDonald rightly figures she has a family of suspects, all with motives, but no alibis. But how is she going to prove some or all of them are guilty before the sixth and final ad break? Step forward her new partner, DS Dodds. Like Morse, if he has a first name no one has used it for decades. Dodds hasn\u2019t been deployed in a non-desk-related crime scenario for 11 years. The brass so want him to take early retirement that they have put his desk under the air-conditioning, which means he has to wear a scarf.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I\u2019m here for two years, tops, so don\u2019t get attached to me,\u201d says DCI Lauren McDonald (Tala Gouveia) at the start of McDonald and Dodds (ITV). Which is no way to launch a TV cop franchise, but still. \u201cBut, while I\u2019m here, I\u2019m gonna solve cases in half the time with half the manpower.\u201d Talking about it won\u2019t make it happen. Imagine Simon Pegg from Hot Fuzz as a crime-solving woman of colour with sarcastic eyebrows and you\u2019ll get the picture. McDonald has been transferred from south London\u2019s mean streets to Bath, a city where the worst crimes are usually the prices for cream teas. Well, not quite. There\u2019s a corpse at a millionaire\u2019s mansion, plugged with two slugs from a military-issue sidearm. Despite the panama hat and expensive shirt, the vic had prison tats and a rap sheet as long as the elegant Regency staircase down which he fell to his death. The mansion is owned by Robert Lindsay\u2019s oleaginous entrepreneur, Max Crockett. He made a \u00a330m fortune from making steam irons which, as one cop puts it, are \u201cthe best things to come out of Bath since Plasticine\u201d. Plasticine was indeed invented in Bath by William Harbutt. No, not William Hardbutt. He invented chair cushions. Crockett is planning to retire. But to which of his three daughters will he leave his fortune? If the premise sounds like King Lear or Succession, let me say this: Brian Cox didn\u2019t give anything away in Succession. And is Crockett\u2019s artisanal-baker daughter, Ellie, who does such a good Cordelia impression all she seems? Not if I know my crime dramas she isn\u2019t. Whodunnit? \u201cMost murder victims are killed by a member of their own family,\u201d McDonald tells the Crocketts. \u201cMaybe where you come from. But not here,\u201d scoffs Crockett\u2019s Goneril-like daughter, Megan, who is not only vice-chair of Bath\u2019s police oversight committee, but the answer to the question: \u201cWho ate all the lemons?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re nice, middle-class people who go glamping,\u201d says her no-less-citrus-filled barrister husband. \u201cWe play boules at the weekend. Where are we going to get a firearm?\u201d McDonald rightly figures she has a family of suspects, all with motives, but no alibis. But how is she going to prove some or all of them are guilty before the sixth and final ad break? Step forward her new partner, DS Dodds. Like Morse, if he has a first name no one has used it for decades. Dodds hasn\u2019t been deployed in a non-desk-related crime scenario for 11 years. The brass so want him to take early retirement that they have put his desk under the air-conditioning, which means he has to wear a scarf. Monsters. I don\u2019t want to endorse the stereotype that Dodds is pale, male and stale, but he wears a tie under a tank top, which is so wrong I don\u2019t know where to start. He may have eyebrows, but they are sneaky ones, so blond that they pass unnoticed on his pasty face. As a result, Jason Watkins, who plays Dodds, has to use not his eyebrows but minimal eye movement to suggest his character\u2019s default mode of existential bewilderment. Watkins was so adorable as W1A\u2019s floral-shirted BBC drone who was literally good for nothing but folding Hugh Bonneville\u2019s Brompton (not a euphemism) that he surprises here as someone with unexpected professional gifts. Dodds breaks the case by spotting a peregrine falcon near the Crockett mansion. Its nest in a nearby church tower, he realises, will be ringed with RSPB-installed cameras, which will show who broke in to the Crocketts\u2019 mansion and offed the stiff. \u201cGood work with the penguin falcon,\u201d says McDonald, still not convinced her new partner isn\u2019t a chump. \u201cPeregrine,\u201d he corrects, saddened by her ignorance of local fauna.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has said he will drive a hard bargain as the UK outlined its negotiating objectives for the forthcoming trade talks with the US. Despite fears that disagreements between London and Washington could obstruct the launch of the negotiations, a government press release claimed the prime minister wanted to open up opportunities for British businesses and investors while also ensuring the NHS was not for sale via the desired free trade agreement. In an acknowledgement of deep concerns among the British electorate that the US will demand access to the NHS, the government stated once again that it remains committed to keeping the health service universal and free at the point of use. The British team also wants to guarantee high standards and protections for British consumers and workers, including on animal welfare. Johnson said: \u201cTrading Scottish smoked salmon for Stetson hats, we will deliver lower prices and more choice for our shoppers. \u201cMost importantly, this transatlantic trade deal will reflect the unique closeness of our two great nations.\u201d A major point of conflict between the two countries has been Johnson\u2019s decision to give Huawei access to the UK\u2019s 5G system. Ministers have repeatedly faced demands to rule out chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef being imported from the US in any deal, with animal welfare and environmental concerns raised. The government are preparing to publish its negotiation mandate with the US on Monday. The talks will take place in parallel alongside negotiations with the EU over a post-Brexit relationship. Trade union leaders have urged Downing Street not to \u201ccosy up\u201d to Donald Trump during the talks, calling on the prime ministers to block any US manoeuvring to lower food standards. The Department for International Trade said it expected manufacturers of ceramics, cars, food and drink, and professional services to be among the British industries to benefit the most from tariff-free access to the US market. Crawford Falconer, a senior DIT adviser and formerly New Zealand\u2019s chief negotiator, will oversee talks on the UK side. Negotiating rounds will alternate between the two countries. Following Britain\u2019s divorce from Brussels in January, it is now free to strike global trade deals. It remains to be seen if the US and the UK can end their differences over a planned digital services tax or the fate of the Iranian nuclear deal. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, said striking ambitious free trade agreements was one of the key opportunities of Britain becoming an independent trading nation. \u201cThis deal with our biggest single trading partner will cut red tape for our small businesses, cut tariffs for our great products from dairy to cars and increase growth in all four nations.\u201d Carolyn Fairbairn, the Confederation of British Industry\u2019s director general, said: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see the government\u2019s ambitions to make it easier for skilled people to move between the UK and US, support small business exporters and future-proof any agreement around industries of the future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI don\u2019t really want to talk about it for obvious reasons, my position and his position now but \u2026 yes we had a lot of interaction because he was very much present in the press room,\u201d says a smiling Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida, the EU\u2019s new and first ambassador to the UK. Thirty years ago, Vale de Almeida, 63, was a young spokesman for the European commission catering to a press corps in Brussels of which Boris Johnson of the Daily Telegraph was a preeminent member. \u201cHe was one of the leading journalists and I don\u2019t think anyone disputes that \u2026 so the likelihood of me replying to his questions was high.\u201d Tall tales about EU condom regulations, and Jacques Delors\u2019 plans to \u201crule Europe\u201d and build the world\u2019s tallest building to house the European commission would fuel Johnson\u2019s journalistic career and feather-bed the Euroscepticism that would eventually take the UK out of the EU and put him in Downing Street. Vale de Almeida, whose career includes spells as chief-of-staff to a European commission president and ambassadorial roles to the US and the UN, can perhaps thank Johnson for his new posting. There has never been an EU ambassador to the UK, because there was no need. Vale de Almeida\u2019s new embassy is at 32 Smith Square in Westminster, previously the site of the commission\u2019s UK delegation. Before that it had been the Conservative party\u2019s headquarters, from where Margaret Thatcher would wave down to the crowds to celebrate her election victories. \u201cIt was from one of them,\u201d he says, gesturing across his as-yet bare office to the windows looking out on to the square. \u201cI think she would not object, because she believed in the relationship between the UK and European Union, and she contributed a lot,\u201d said Vale de Almeida, who transitioned from journalism himself shortly after the fall of Portugal\u2019s dictatorship. He joined the European commission in the early 1980s as his country acceded to what was then the European Economic Community. Among his tasks is to ensure the UK implements the withdrawal agreement, particularly the provisions on EU citizens\u2019 rights and the compromise reached on avoiding a border on the island of Ireland. The UK is committed to establishing an independent monitoring group by 1 January 2021 for protection of the rights of EU citizens in the UK, for whom there is no certain figure, but they are likely to number around 3.8 million. Vale de Almeida, however, says Brussels also needs to take responsibility. He says the settled status scheme the Home Office has established is digital and requires \u201ca computer to get there\u201d, creating potential difficulties for \u201ceveryone that is for some reason outside of the mainstream\u201d, be they from the Roma community, elderly or in prison or pre-trial detention. The deadline for applications is June 2021. \u201cWe have a few lawyers working with us but other entities as well. But I think we need to step up our action. We have to go deeper into the British society to try and reach out to all these citizens,\u201d Vale de Almeida said in an interview to mark the launch of a new Guardian series on Europe. On the Irish border, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, expressed his frustration last week at suggestions from the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, and others that the UK will not check goods crossing the Irish Sea, as stipulated in the compromise found for avoiding such checks on the island of Ireland. \u201cWe will have to follow that very closely,\u201d Vale de Almeida said. His other main role will be to keep the 27 member states\u2019 unity, which he says is in the UK\u2019s interest to maintain, and gather intelligence and insight for the EU\u2019s negotiators as they engage in talks this month with Britain over the future relationship. Both sides are in posturing mode. Barnier felt the need to bash his lectern at a press conference in Brussels last week when discussing Britain\u2019s opening position. Johnson\u2019s government says it wants a \u201czero tariff, zero quota\u201d deal with regulatory alignment no more onerous than that of countries such as Canada. It counters Barnier\u2019s insistence that the intensity of the UK\u2019s trade with the EU and its proximity requires a greater obligation to stick close to the EU rulebook by evoking Britain\u2019s need to regain its economic and political sovereignty by the end of the transition period, when the UK leaves the single market and customs union. The narrative has not gone down well with the EU. \u201cI think, in today\u2019s world, the concept of sovereignty has evolved to a large extent, but it goes without saying that national sovereignty should be respected,\u201d Vale de Almeida said. \u201cWe believe here it\u2019s not about black and white \u2018are we sovereign or not sovereign\u2019. It\u2019s about, in full respect of sovereignty, how much can we do together.\u201d Vale de Almeida played a role negotiating the ill-fated trade deal with the US known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which Donald Trump ultimately killed off. It was, he says, the first trade negotiation to become highly politicised based largely on \u201cmisinformation and on manipulation\u201d of facts by its critics. \u201cAnd it is never going to change\u201d, he said. \u201cWe will never go back to a situation where a trade deal between the EU and the US would be out of the front pages or a trade deal between the EU and the UK will be out of the front pages.\u201d He predicts a busy year at 32 Smith Square. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 March 2020.

There are concerns that thousands of EU nationals will fail to apply to the Home Office to stay because they lack information or the means to see the digital application process through. The new EU ambassador to the UK, Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida, said Brussels and the embassies of the bloc\u2019s 27 member states in London needed to step up efforts to reach those on the fringes of British society. EU nationals need to apply before 31 June 2021 to remain in the UK but there is uncertainty about the number of citizens affected and the level of success in information getting through to the most cut-off groups. Vale de Almeida said a special focus was on \u201ceveryone that is for some reason outside the mainstream for socioeconomic [reasons] or age or ethnic or otherwise\u201d.

Is it, as they seem to believe in Spain, that he just doesn\u2019t care that much?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s probably a bit of everything. The last two years have been terrible, as you say, and I\u2019ve no idea why he didn\u2019t leave last summer.

      "bodyText": "Sid Lowe\u2019s match report has landed so I\u2019ll leave you with that. Thanks for your company - goodnight! Real go back to the top of the table with an ultimately deserved victory in the clasico. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve beaten Barcelona in La Liga since 2016. That\u2019s quite an introduction. It was all Mariano\u2019s own work. He ran to receive a long throw down the right, then let the ball run past him and sped away from his marker Umtiti. Mariano kept going, all the way into the area, and screwed a shot over ter Stegen from a tight angle. I think he mishit the shot, but who cares: he\u2019s in tears of joy! Mariano scores immediately to seal victory for Madrid! 90+1 min The superb Benzema is replaced by Mariano Diaz. 90+1 min Three minutes of added time. Barcelona win a free-kick on the left; ter Stegen comes forward, but Messi curls it straight into Courtois\u2019 hands. 90 min Casemiro has had a marvellous game against Messi, giving him no space at all. 89 min Ramos\u2019s free-kick hits the wall. 88 min Busquets fouls Lucas in the D. Sergio Ramos is over the ball. 87 min \u201cAs a proud Dane I need to point out that Braithwaite made his debut against Eibar a week ago,\u201d says Rikke Slot Johnsen. \u201cHe replaced Griezman for the last 18 minutes and was involved in the to last Barca goals. I know the signing was a surprise in many ways, but of course we wish him det best!\u201d Oh lord. I resign. 86 min Lucas Vazquez replaces Fede Valverde. Incidentally, the Madrid goal may go down as a Pique own goal; I\u2019m not certain Vinicius Jr\u2019s shot was on target. 85 min Messi is booked for a petulant hack at Casemiro. 84 min The relentlessly positive Vinicius Jr. produces a brilliant bit of skill to beat three Barcelona players just inside the area, and ter Stegen flies out to dive at his feet and push the ball away. 83 min: Excellent chance for Barcelona! Messi\u2019s free-kick from the left is headed wide at the near post by the unmarked Pique. That was a superb chance. He completely mistimed his header and the ball went well wide. 81 min A double change for Barcelona: Ansu Fati and Rakitic replace Arthur and Griezmann. 79 min Modric replaces Isco for Real Madrid. 78 min Vinicius Jr. is off target with a flick behind his standing leg, although Carvajal had been flagged offside just before that. 77 min It started slowly, but this is pulsating stuff now. 75 min Messi scampers onto de Jong\u2019s pass, and for a split-second it looks like he\u2019s going to clear on goal. But Marcelo strains desperately to stay with him and makes a vital tackle in the D. When the danger is fully over, Marcelo celebrates by punching the air to the Real fans! 74 min If it stays like this Real will go back to the top of La Liga, a point ahead of Barcelona. Vinicius Jr. has given Real the lead! It was made by Kroos, who slid a lovely pass down the inside-left channel that took out two defenders and found Vinicius Jr. in space. He moved into the area, opened his body and sidefooted a shot that took a big deflection off the sliding Pique and beat ter Stegen at the near post. Real are ahead! 70 min Braithwaite almost scores immediately! Semedo, in his own half, curled a superb long pass around the defence towards Braithwaite. He bounced Varane (I think) off the ball just outside the area and poked a shot that was blocked by Courtois, with Ramos (I think) completing the clearance in the six-yard box. 69 min Of all the gin joints in all the world, Martin Braithwaite had to make his Barcelona debut in the Bernabeu. He has come on to replace Arturo Vidal. 69 min ter Stegen makes a fine save with his feet from Sergio Ramos, although he was miles offside and it wouldn\u2019t have counted. 67 min \u201cThe Booze XI are managed by Dick Advocaat, I presume?\u201d says Sean Clayton. 65 min It was Arthur who caught him, in fact, but Vinicius had already played the ball across the area and I don\u2019t think that was a penalty. 64 min Real appeal unsuccessfully for a penalty when Vinicius goes over under a challenge from Pique (I think). We haven\u2019t seen a replay yet. 63 min: Another chance for Real! That was brilliant play from Carvajal. He charged through the inside-left channel, cut back on his right foot and clipped a lovely angled pass to find Benzema in space in the area. He watched the ball carefully onto his right foot... and then volleyed it over the bar. 61 min: Pique clears off the line! Real are really pressing now. Carvajal does really well to stand up a cross from the byline. Isco strains his neck muscles to plan a downward header that beats the diving ter Stegen and is blocked on the line by the backpedalling Pique. 60 min Benzema is having a terrific game for Real. Vinicius has also been a big threat, even if his decision-making hasn\u2019t always been great. 58 min \u201cEnjoying the not-so-classic (as of yet) cl\u00e1sico?\u201d asks Oliver Stewart, I presume rhetorically. \u201cI\u2019d like to submit Bacardi Sagna as a much-needed defensive addition to the Booze XI.\u201d I want Marc-Andre turps Stegen in goal. 56 min: Excellent save from ter Stegen! Real took a short corner on the left, with Kroos and Marceloa moving the ball to Isco on the edge of the area. He bent a right-footed curler towards the far top corner, and ter Stegen leapt to his left to flap it behind. Barcelona were asleep at a corner, again. 53 min Real break through Benzema, who finds Vinicius on the left wing. He runs at Semedo, beating him on the left of the area, but his cutback is intercepted by the well-positioned Pique at the near post. 51 min Lots of Barcelona possession at the start of the second half. Madrid look content to play on the counter-attack. 48 min Messi plays a give-and-go with de Jong, moves into the area and hits a shot that is blocked. The ball rebounds to Alba, who wins a corner on the left. 47 min \u201cI had a couple too many last night, and am feeling a little tender today, so I made you a Booze XI,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cFun Fact: it says here that the author of \u2018The Name of the Rose\u2019 was a marauding, box-to-box midfielder in his youth. Ben Fosters Ryan Sauvignon Lewis Drunk Danny Ros\u00e9 Didier Deschampers Marc Hungovermars Zinfandele Alli Umberto Prosecco Grenadine Zidane Edinson Cava-ni IPA van Hooijdonk 46 min Peep peep! Half-time reading \u201cI take your point but from what I have seen of Barca this year their midfield creativity has been poor &amp; Messi has had to do the job,\u201d says Mike Nagle. \u201cI think Eriksen would have been a good creator for Messi &amp; co.\u201d They already have loads of central midfielders, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s enough of an upgrade to justify buying him. He would have been a computer-game signing for Barcelona, I think. Peep peep! No goals, but the match improved after a really scruffy start. Thibaut Courtois made an excellent save from Arthur and a decent save one from Lionel Messi. At the other end, Madrid got into some good positions only to pick the wrong option. 44 min The last time both clasicos finished goalless in the same league season was ... never, as far as I can tell.. There were consecutive goalless draws in 1973 but they spanned the 1972-73 and 1973-74 seasons. 42 min \u201cArthur is meh (in my opinion) and Modric is getting on,\u201d says Christopher Faherty. \u201cIsco is also meh. I\u2019m not sure Eriksen is good enough for either of them but there\u2019s a logic to the suggestion.\u201d I take your point, I just don\u2019t think that position is a priority for either team. 41 min It\u2019s all happening now. At the other end, Vinicius underhits a cutback to Isco in the area. That was a decent chance as well. 40 min Semedo beats Ramos on the right, surges into the area and cuts the ball back for Vidal. His shot from the edge of the area is really well blocked by Carvajal. 38 min Messi misses a decent chance. He beat Varane to a bouncing ball on the edge of the area and hammered it towards goal, but the shot was nowhere near the corner and Courtois was able to beat it away. 37 min Vinicius Jr. leads a Real break, charging down the inside-left channel. He gets to the edge of the area but then picks the wrong option, lofting a tame curling shot straight at ter Stegen. He should have tried to take on Pique or find a teammate. 35 min \u201cIs Tony Pulis in charge of Barca?\u201d says Stephen Carr. \u201cWorkmanlike doesn\u2019t even come close...\u201d 34 min: Good save from Courtois! Barcelona almost stole the lead on the break. Griezmann, on the halfway line, played a pass infield from the left to Arthur, who charged away from Kroos and kept going, all the way into the area with Varane and Ramos nowhere to be seen. Arthur tried to shape the ball into the far corner, but Courtois stayed big and diverted it wide of the far post. 33 min Alba, who was harshly booked earlier, gets away with a dodgy tackle on Valverde. The referee didn\u2019t give a free-kick; had he done so, Alba might have walked. 30 min Courtois makes a comfortable save from Messi. It was good play from Barcelona, with Arthur, Vidal and Griezmann combining well before Messi clipped a low right-footed shot from 15 yards that was held by the crouching Courtois. 30 min \u201cGiven their respective problems I don\u2019t quite understand why either of these sides did not try to sign Eriksen,\u201d says Mike Nagle. \u201cAny thoughts?\u201d As much as I love Eriksen, I\u2019m not sure either team needs another midfield schemer, do they? It\u2019s in wide positions and/or up front that they are a bit short. 29 min Some more nice play from Madrid. Vinicius drives a low cross from the right to Benzema, who lovingly tees up Kroos for a first-time shot from 25 yards. It whistles over the bar. 28 min Messi is starting to threaten. He plays a one-two with Griezmann and tries to scurry into the area, with Casemiro doing well to track him all the way. 27 min Valverde\u2019s superb cross from the right flashes across the six-yard line, just in front of Benzema. 26 min \u201cRegarding Brathwaite, even as a Barca fan I find the whole deal stinks but I think we\u2019ll keep him next year and then he either gets loaned out or moved on the following summer, presumably back to the lower trenches of La Liga,\u201d says Simon Emmett. \u201cI just feel the whole rule needs reviewing, as if I was a Leganes fan I\u2019d be livid! More worrying for me though is Barca\u2019s ongoing recruitment strategy \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re up to! I can\u2019t wait for the new president and the return of Xavi, hopefully all by 2021!\u201d 25 min Messi is dropping deeper in an attempt to make the play. There aren\u2019t that many mobile players around him, although the return of his beloved Jordi Alba gives him a few more options. 23 min The last few minutes have been a bit better. It\u2019s still pretty cagey, though, and the first goal feels really important. 21 min Lovely play from Barcelona. Alba, found by Messi on the left side of the area, fizzes a low pass towards Griezmann near the penalty spot. He takes the shot first time but sweeps it high over the bar. 20 min Courtois is almost dispossessed by Griezmann. He gets away with it and Real scoot down the other end, where Marcelo\u2019s low cross is pushed away by the diving ter Stegen. Marcelo should have cut it back to Isco, who was unmarked 10 yards from goal. 20 min \u201cAs you point out, pouring down here in Madrid - first rain in weeks and weeks,\u201d says John Alford. \u201cWatching in a bar with some Spanish mates - curiously subdued atmosphere - nobody is expecting RM to do anything! \u2018Bring on Bale\u2019, cue howls of derision.\u201d 19 min Carvajal and Alba have a bit of a slanging match and are both booked. Carvajal can have no complaints, as he pushed Alba. I\u2019m not sure what Alba did wrong though. 18 min Griezmann plays a good one-two with de Jong and surges into the area before being crowded out by Varane and Ramos. 17 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Kishalay Banerjee. \u201cRegarding Barcelona\u2019s signing of Braithwaite, it is hard to see him staying at Camp Nou after this season, even if he performs decently. What happens next for such \u2018emergency signings\u2019 who are then left on the bench? I don\u2019t imagine his stock will be particularly high among other clubs, despite having Barcelona on his CV.\u201d Yes, good point. I don\u2019t blame Braithwaite \u2013 how do you turn down Barcelona \u2013 but the whole thing stinks. 16 min The clasico used to be the best game in the world, but the first game this season ended 0-0 and so far this has been poor. What happened to this thing? 15 min Good play from Vinicius, who cuts back inside Semedo and tees up Kroos on the edge of the area. He curls a first-time shot high and wide. 14 min \u201cBale\u2019s situation is complex and perplexing,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cAs a Welshman, however, and given his injury history over recent seasons, I\u2019m happy to see him spend as much time on the Real bench as possible. Ideally, just give him a few games at the end of the season to ease himself into form ready to storm the Euros.\u201d Good luck with that. The Euros are going to be cancelled, aren\u2019t they? 12 min Vinicius Jr. beats Semedo with ease but overhits his cross. It hasn\u2019t been the greatest start to the game. 11 min It\u2019s absolutely pouring down at the Bernabeu. Slide tackles please! 10 min Vinicius Jr. is booked for a foul on Semedo. 8 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Alex Netherton. \u201cDo you mind giving the MBM to a better writer? Cheers.\u201d I\u2019d love to. Missing bloody Last Tango in Halifax for this. 6 min Barcelona have had most of the ball in the early minutes, although Madrid have won the only corners. A cross from Vinicius Jr. is put behind for their third. It\u2019s played short to Marcelo, whose cross is headed away to the edge of the area by Semedo. The backpedalling Benzema volleys high over the bar. 4 min It\u2019s pouring down in Madrid. The formations, are far as I can see, are 4-4-2 for Barcelona (Vidal right, de Jong left) and a loose 4-1-4-1 for Madrid, with Isco pushing up to support Benzema when they have the ball. 2 min Isco wins an early corner for Madrid, though nothing comes of it. It looks like he\u2019s playing in a central position, with Valverde on the right. 1 min Peep peep! Madrid kick off from left to right as I watch. The captains, Sergio Ramos and Lionel Messi, embrace at the coin toss. It\u2019s time for another clasico. \u201cIf the emergency signing is only on the bench,\u201d says Justin Horton, \u201chow much of an emergency can it have been?\u201d It was mes que un emergencia. Tacticswatch Arturo Vidal played on the right in a 4-3-3 against Napoli in the week. I suspect that\u2019s what will happen here, though Barcelona could also play a diamond midfield. It looks like the usual 4-3-3 for Real, with Isco roaming from the right wing. \u201cBale again on the bench,\u201d says Peter Van. \u201cWhat\u2019s your take on Bale\u2019s woes? He was hired as Real\u2019s successor to Ronaldo; those are impossible shoes to fill, but Bale certainly seemed to have the potential to be a superstar. But his last couple of seasons have been a disaster. Is it just a mental block? Injury problems? Is it, as they seem to believe in Spain, that he just doesn\u2019t care that much?\u201d It\u2019s probably a bit of everything. The last two years have been terrible, as you say, and I\u2019ve no idea why he didn\u2019t leave last summer. But I suspect history will be kinder to his overall Real career. Pre-match reading Two changes apiece. Marcelo and Toni Kroos return for Real, with Ferland Mendy and Luka Modric dropped. Jordi Alba and Arthur are back for Barcelona in place of Junior Firpo and Ivan Rakitic. The new signing Martin Braithwaite is on the bench. Real Madrid (4-3-3) Courtois; Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Marcelo; Valverde, Casemiro, Kroos; Isco, Benzema, Vinicius Jr. Substitutes: Areola, Militao, Modric, Bale, Lucas Vazquez, Mendy, Mariano. Barcelona (4-3-3) ter Stegen; Semedo, Pique, Umtiti, Alba; de Jong, Busquets, Arthur; Vidal, Messi, Griezmann. Substitutes: Neto, Rakitic, Lenglet, Braithwaite, Junior, Collado, Ansu Fati. Hello and welcome to live coverage of Real Madrid v Barcelona in La Liga. El Clasico may not have the glamour or quality of its recent golden age, but the stakes are as high as ever. One of these teams will win La Liga this season, and tonight\u2019s result may ultimately decide which one. Barcelona are two points clear of Real with 13 games to go. This match, in all probability, is Madrid\u2019s season entire. They are out of the Copa del Rey and almost certainly on their way out of the Champions League. They had regrouped impressively under Zinedine Zidane, having had such a desperate 2018-19, but defeats to Levante and Manchester City in the past week have set them back a long way. They still have every chance of beating a Barcelona side that have been diminished by injuries and infighting. Jordi Alba is back in the squad for tonight\u2019s game, though, and the controversial signing Martin Braithwaite could make his debut. Kick off is at 8pm GMT, 9pm in Madrid.",

      "bodyText": "Kids TV and Australian drama will be devastated if commercial networks follow through with threats to abandon local content quotas, producers and children\u2019s media advocates have warned. After posting a $67m loss for the first half of the 2020 financial year, Seven West Media chief executive James Warburton threatened to stop producing new children\u2019s programs and local drama because the cost of doing so was unsustainable and the audience was dwindling. Nine Entertainment chief executive Hugh Marks, who reported a 9% slump in profits this week and announced $100m in cuts to broadcast TV, immediately joined the call to abandon quotas. The minister for communications, Paul Fletcher, confirmed Warburton had written to him to push for the ongoing review of quotas to be sped up but said no discussions with Seven had been held yet. The Australian screen content review, which examined the adequacy of quotas for Australian content and tax incentives for local production, was completed in 2017 but has yet to be released, which has frustrated the commercial networks. The Australian Communications and Media Authority told Guardian Australia a failure by any network to meet its obligations under the TV licence would result in a series of \u201cformal enforcement options\u201d, escalating to civil penalties. Under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the Australian Content Standard 2016 and Children\u2019s Television Standards 2009, networks Seven, Nine and Ten are obliged to provide a minimum of 260 hours of children\u2019s (C) programs annually, of which half must be first release, and a minimum of 130 hours of Australian preschool (P) programs annually. Elizabeth Handsley, president of the Australian Council on Children and the Media, said the amount of money the broadcasters put into making these programs was relatively small. Acma has reported that the commercial networks spend up to 1.6% of their programming budgets on children\u2019s content \u2013 including foreign programming \u2013 and that new Australian production amounts to 0.5%. \u201cIf they abandoned their obligations we\u2019d be at the mercy of the ABC and hoping that streaming services started making local children\u2019s content,\u201d Handlsey told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt would all be a wish and a prayer.

The screen industry has argued that left to their own devices, networks would abandon children\u2019s content and the younger generation would be robbed of the opportunity to be educated and entertained by local artists and to see Australian stories on the screen. The content that is profitable for the networks in the age of Netflix and streaming video-on-demand is marquee reality TV shows like Married at First Sight, news and current affairs and live sport. The chief executive of Screen Producers Australia, Matthew Deaner, said it is nonsense that well-made and properly marketed children\u2019s television can\u2019t find an audience. \u201cWhat the broadcasters are doing to children\u2019s content is equivalent to wrapping it up in a brown paper bag and putting it on the bottom of the shelf at the back of the store, moving it every other week to another hidden spot and then acting surprised when it doesn\u2019t sell,\u201d Deaner said. \u201cAustralian parents have a right to freely access quality Australian content specifically designed for the needs of their children across trusted brands such as Seven, Nine and Ten. \u201cA thoughtless removal of quotas would act as a reward to what has been a steady decline in investments, promotion and marketing of quality Australian children\u2019s content, and destroy so much of the ecology of the sector.\u201d Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said it was disappointing to see the networks try to escape their obligations to make high-quality children\u2019s programs. \u201cIf children\u2019s TV is going to survive in the modern, competitive media landscape then there needs to be reform,\u201d Hanson-Young said. \u201cNew players like Netflix, Stan and Disney have changed the way we consume media and children\u2019s TV cannot be left behind. \u201cLocally made kids TV is a vital part of telling our Australian stories.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s summers are getting longer and winters have become shorter as a result of global heating, according to a new report from the Australia Institute. The discussion paper, to be released on Monday, said that trend was \u201chighly likely\u201d to continue and would bring with it longer and hotter bushfire seasons, more heatwaves, while agricultural crops will be damaged, livestock will suffer and entire ecosystems will be placed at risk. \u201cIf it feels like Australian summers are getting longer and hotter, that is probably because they are,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe summers many Australians grew up with no longer exist.\u201d The researchers Tom Swann and Mark Ogge examined Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) temperature data from 70 weather stations across the country to compare daily average temperatures over the past two decades with an earlier mid-20th century benchmark. They found that between 1999 and 2018 Australia experienced summer temperatures for a full 31 days longer, compared to a benchmark between 1950 and 1969, while winter temperatures lasted 23 fewer days over the same comparative periods. Over the past two decades, summer was on average a month longer than it was in the mid-20th century. The report said temperatures that \u201cmarked the start of summer now come around two weeks earlier\u201d, and \u201ctemperatures that marked the end of summer now come around two weeks later\u201d. Last month, the Bureau of Meteorology confirmed 2019 was Australia\u2019s hottest year on record, although the Australia Institute report was unable to include 2019 data in its analysis. The researchers also narrowed in on temperatures over the past five years, measured against that same 1950-1969 benchmark, and found that summers were now on average close to 50% longer. \u201cThese most recent summers were twice as long as the most recent winters,\u201d the report added. Examining the data, the discussion paper said that while in \u201cevery capital city, summers have grown longer and winters have grown shorter\u201d, there was evidence of even larger changes in regional areas. For example, the report said that summers were 48 days or seven weeks longer in Port Macquarie, and that the length of winter had halved in seven areas across the country. Meanwhile, summers were now 38 days longer in Melbourne, 36 days longer in Adelaide, and 35 days longer in Hobart and Perth. In Sydney, summer was now 118 days, 28 days longer than it had been on average in the mid-20th century. Although they say that \u201ccaution is needed extrapolating to the future from past observations, especially over short time frames\u201d, the researchers said it is \u201chighly likely over the medium and longer them that summers will continue to get longer and hotter\u201d. \u201cThese trends are likely to continue indefinitely unless greenhouse gas emissions are decisively reduced, ultimately to net-zero,\u201d the report said. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute\u2019s climate and energy program director, said longer summers and shorter winters would leave less time for authorities to enforce bushfire management strategies. He said that Australia was currently experiencing 1C of global warming, but that the government\u2019s current emissions reduction targets are \u201caligned with 3 to 4C of warming, which leaves young Australians facing ever lengthening summers with significant consequences\u201d. The researchers drew on data from weather stations in subtropical and temperate areas across southern Queensland and Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Tasmania. The discussion paper adds to analysis showing the impact of the climate crisis on Australia\u2019s summers. A Victorian CFA and BoM study released last year found that global heating was in part responsible for the increased length of bushfire seasons, while a 2017 ANU study found that even if the Paris agreement targets were met, summer heatwaves in major Australian cities were likely to reach highs of 50C by 2040.",

His talent has never been in doubt. It is more the question of whether he has those hard edges to bring it to bear, or indeed whether he will get the air to breath in this winning machine. How much football is enough football? Have his horizons been preserved, or even shrunk by that extended apprenticeship? One thing is clear after this performance. He really does need to be out there, being stretched and refined, finding the outer limits of his own extraordinary talent.</p> <p>There were some lovely moments. With 26 minutes gone Foden ran towards a pass from Rodri on the edge of the area and took a touch of the ball that is best described as supernatural \u2013 killing it, stunning it, tasering it, leaving the ball nuzzled on the edge of his toe as he ran, then shifted sideways to shoot past the far post.</p> <p>Foden had already helped to make Manchester City\u2019s opening goal on 19 minutes, heading Rodri\u2019s floated pass inside for Sergio Ag\u00fcero to bundle the ball home. Rodri scored the second soon afterwards, nodding in from Ilkay Gundogan\u2019s corner, a goal scored with no resistance, no friction, no sense of other bodies on the pitch.</p> <p>At which point the game died on its gurney for 20 minutes. Villa sat deep. The black shirts moved, threading their patterns. There was a sense of mild sadism about all this. How long is a football match? I mean, really, how <em>long</em>? To see a world in a grain of sand. To feel the endless deserts of all recorded time stretching out either side of you while Fernandinho plays a sideways pass to John Stones and Jack Grealish runs around looking for imaginary space, an opening, a way into the day.</p> <p>Wembley had been a boisterous place at kick-off, as it always is on these flag-day Cup finals, for all the talk about sterile grey corporate husks (see for detail: any England game). Guardiola had rotated his team again here, replacing some very good players with some other very good players. Here come the fill-ins: a \u00a350m centre\u2011half and the best young ball-playing midfielder in England.</p> <p>And yet for a while there was a sense City\u2019s players wanted this game to be over. There was a slackening of air, a sense of the day congealing. As half-time approached Villa were playing with more rage and more edge. They deserved their goal, scored by Mbwana Samatta.</p> <p>Foden was City\u2019s best player throughout all this, running the game at times from inside right. He looks leaner, stronger and more athletic. He has a lovely medium\u2011range passing ability, the feel for weight and pace and trajectory that lets him roll the ball into the feet of a runner or find the space behind the space between the moving bodies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/01/aston-villa-v-manchester-city-carabao-cup-final-live\">Aston Villa 1-2 Manchester City: Carabao Cup final \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With seven minutes gone he did something delightful, spinning away from two players in midfield, somehow retaining the ball, weaving inside, yawning off a pass. Later he sprinted 30 yards with the ball, gliding left and right with that pond-skater style. There was a casual, clever, too-intricate touch, something a bit \u201cacademy ground\u201d as Gundogan found him with a long pass on the edge of the box.</p> <p>Understandably perhaps. Before this game Foden had played 120 minutes of football since 4 January. Will he be ready for the summer and a return to Wembley at the Euros? The answer, of course, is yes. Foden looks made for the rhythms, the slow technical style of international tournament football.</p> <p>Without context, to the first-time Martian viewer, it might come as a surprise that Raheem Sterling, the man on the other wing, is seen as a certainty to start England\u2019s opening game, Foden just a callow outsider. Foden has his best days all ahead of him, has none of Sterling\u2019s numbers, his proven weight. But he also has a dizzying range of gears to his game, that sense, seen in glimpses, that this is a player who can pretty much do anything with a ball at his feet.</p> <p>As the final whistle blew City were holding on a little. The players sank to the turf. There was a tableau of familiar bobbing-huddle domestic trophy joy. Foden will remember this more than most.</p> <p>As with everything City do right now his performance also felt like a kind of rebuke, a statement of defiance \u2013 so, so much defiance \u2013 in self-made adversity. Look! We can make players, too. Behold the human face of our nation-state endeavours. Whatever happens from here, wherever this strange, uncharted, oddly furious journey leads, the future looks Foden-coloured.</p>",

Here come the fill-ins: a \u00a350m centre\u2011half and the best young ball-playing midfielder in England. And yet for a while there was a sense City\u2019s players wanted this game to be over. There was a slackening of air, a sense of the day congealing. As half-time approached Villa were playing with more rage and more edge. They deserved their goal, scored by Mbwana Samatta. Foden was City\u2019s best player throughout all this, running the game at times from inside right. He looks leaner, stronger and more athletic. He has a lovely medium\u2011range passing ability, the feel for weight and pace and trajectory that lets him roll the ball into the feet of a runner or find the space behind the space between the moving bodies. With seven minutes gone he did something delightful, spinning away from two players in midfield, somehow retaining the ball, weaving inside, yawning off a pass. Later he sprinted 30 yards with the ball, gliding left and right with that pond-skater style. There was a casual, clever, too-intricate touch, something a bit \u201cacademy ground\u201d as Gundogan found him with a long pass on the edge of the box. Understandably perhaps. Before this game Foden had played 120 minutes of football since 4 January. Will he be ready for the summer and a return to Wembley at the Euros? The answer, of course, is yes. Foden looks made for the rhythms, the slow technical style of international tournament football. Without context, to the first-time Martian viewer, it might come as a surprise that Raheem Sterling, the man on the other wing, is seen as a certainty to start England\u2019s opening game, Foden just a callow outsider. Foden has his best days all ahead of him, has none of Sterling\u2019s numbers, his proven weight. But he also has a dizzying range of gears to his game, that sense, seen in glimpses, that this is a player who can pretty much do anything with a ball at his feet. As the final whistle blew City were holding on a little. The players sank to the turf. There was a tableau of familiar bobbing-huddle domestic trophy joy. Foden will remember this more than most. As with everything City do right now his performance also felt like a kind of rebuke, a statement of defiance \u2013 so, so much defiance \u2013 in self-made adversity. Look! We can make players, too. Behold the human face of our nation-state endeavours. Whatever happens from here, wherever this strange, uncharted, oddly furious journey leads, the future looks Foden-coloured.",

Harshly booked for tackle on Guilbert. 4 Sergio Ag\u00fcero Predatory instincts as sharp as ever to dart in front of Mings to fire City into lead with early goal. 7 Subs De Bruyne (for G\u00fcndogan 58); B Silva (for D Silva 77); Jesus (Ag\u00fcero 83). Not used Ederson, Mendy, Mahrez, Otamendi.",

Azar told Fox News Sunday the Chicago case was one of 23 to be diagnosed in a person who had not been repatriated from Japan or China. \u201cOf those individuals, we\u2019ve got cases in Chicago as well as Washington and Oregon and two in California where we do not yet know why they contracted the novel coronavirus,\u201d Azar said. Two other people in Illinois have tested positive for coronavirus: a husband and wife who traveled to Wuhan, China, to care for a relative. They have made a full recovery. Rhode Island\u2019s health department said a presumptive case was identified there in a person in their 40s who had recently traveled to Italy. The person\u2019s family have been in self-quarantine and efforts are under way to contact others who have been in close contact with them. Washington governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency on Saturday. The man who died was in his 50s and had underlying health conditions and no history of travel or contact with a known coronavirus case. Eight people have tested positive in Washington, according to the state\u2019s health department. Two of those cases were reported on Sunday as men in their 60s with underlying health conditions. Another 50 people with symptoms of respiratory illness were being tested at a nursing home in Washington state, where a worker in her 40s and a resident in her 70s tested positive.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s no such thing as a closed casket in my culture. In Samoa, the dead are still part of the living until they are buried. Growing up on the island of Savai\u2019i, one of my earliest memories was being thrust into a coffin to kiss one of my great-uncles goodbye. This may sound horrific, but for Samoans, this is the norm, and at any given funeral, you will witness a child being held over the face of a dead relative, a mother trying to pull the body of their loved one out of a casket or an adult son or daughter being physically removed from the casket of their parent. We grieve openly and the body of the dead is usually on full display, with people welcome to touch, kiss and even hug the body in an open casket. We talk to them as if they hear us, families sing hymns, pray, have family meetings and dine with the casket in the fale (house) for days before the burial. But at my mother\u2019s funeral, I found myself apologising to her as I covered her face with a fine, white lace and closed her casket. It hurt every part of me to do so, because in life, she never hid from anything. She was proud, fierce and an extraordinary orator and High Chief. My mother Vaasiliifiti Moelagi Jackson, was a passionate advocate for the environment, a fashion icon and a pioneer of indigenous women\u2019s rights in Samoa and the Pacific. The woman found ways to stand out, even at funerals, and yet here I was covering her face at her own. But it was for the very fact that she was the strong, dignified and fiercely proud woman that she was that I covered her face on the occasion of her own funeral. I did not want her to be photographed in death and I did not want such images of her to be posted and shared on Facebook, a now common practice among Samoans. Our open grief practices have taken a different turn in the age of social media as the practice of interacting with the dead has extended to filming \u201cgrief TikToks\u201d with the dead, and the sharing on Facebook of photographs of the dead in hospital beds, on mortuary slabs and in their coffins.

This series finale takes audacious flights, rewriting Doctor Who lore to extravagant degrees, creating an alternative backstory for the creation of Gallifrey and a <em>completely</em> new backstory for the Doctor, that reveals her as the fabled Timeless Child: not the last of the Timelords, but the first. Jodie Whittaker gives one of her most visceral performances, as the Doctor learns the truth about her origins \u2013 and her part in the much-storied malevolence of the Timelords. Everything changes ... and yet as is always the case with this show, nothing <em>really </em>changes. The Doctor is still an unknowable force of nature with a shady past. And, just when it looks like things might really get shaken up, the Doctor is once again prevented from committing genocide by kindly terrorist Ko Shamur.</p> <p>Because a finale needs pace as well as tension, there\u2019s an amusing subplot by the Cybermen advance back on the ship, as Yaz, Graham and the rest of the humans come up with the ruse of disguising themselves in Cyber armour (human remains and all). It\u2019s a pretty dim Cyber-army that falls for that if you ask me, but it works, reuniting Team Tardis on Gallifrey. All setting up a zinger of a cliffhanger, which sees the Doctor\u2019s past lives come home to roost as she\u2019s carted off as a fugitive by the Judoon to spend forever on a prison ship.

It has made the character even madder to discover that his nemesis, the Doctor, is intrinsically bound up in his DNA. And all the more deliciously horrible to take such delight in her being indirectly culpable for genocide. I\u2019m going to say it out loud \u2013 this could be the most malevolent Master the show has yet seen. Fittingly, the guy has not only a wet room but a torture chamber in the basement.

Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said the patient \u201chad no relevant travel\u201d and an investigation was under way to determine whether the patient contracted the virus directly or indirectly from someone who had recently returned from overseas. The case suggests the country is edging closer to the point where containment becomes impossible because the virus is being spread by people who are either unaware they are infected, or are diagnosed too late to prevent onward transmission. The Essex patient was among 13 new cases reported on Sunday, bringing the total UK infections to 36. It is the largest single-day increase of new cases in the UK so far. One of the new cases is the first to be reported in Scotland, while two cases in total had previously been reported in Northern Ireland and Wales. The patient in Scotland, who is a resident of the Tayside area and had recently travelled from Italy, has been admitted to hospital and is receiving treatment in isolation. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, chaired a meeting of the Scottish government resilience committee on Sunday evening and will be taking part in a similar meeting chaired by Boris Johnson on Monday morning. Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said: \u201cThis really adds to the supposition that many are now making that this one is going to be very hard to put back in the box. It makes it particularly difficult to control any outbreak if there are people who don\u2019t know they\u2019re spreading it.\u201d Johnson will chair a Cobra meeting on Monday to review the next steps aimed at containing the virus, and he will tell those signing off the strategy that the government will \u201cstop at nothing\u201d to fight the disease. The meeting will be attended by senior ministers as well as Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance in order to ratify the government\u2019s proposed countermeasures. The prime minister is set to tell those at the meeting: \u201cThe number of coronavirus cases around the world is rising every day \u2013 and the UK is no exception.

A spokesperson for Cathay Pacific said the plane was being disinfected and the airline was helping authorities trace passengers who came into close contact with the man. Among measures announced by the Department of Health and Social Care on Sunday were a ministerial lead on the virus in every department and a cross-Whitehall \u201cwar room\u201d to coordinate a beefed-up public information campaign. One of the newly confirmed cases is a patient from Bury in Greater Manchester, who is being treated at a specialist NHS infection centre, according to Bury council.

      "bodyText": "Moses Kamaras stands at the foot of Lesbos\u2019 Statue of Liberty, holding a pair of sodden shoes in his left hand, a rucksack hoisted over his right shoulder. The sun is in early ascent but the boat that has brought him \u2013 and 59 others \u2013 to this first bit of soil they will know as Europe is already the fourth to have landed on the island\u2019s southern shores. By midday on Sunday two more vessels will have crossed from Turkey, carrying 127 Afghans to the north of the Aegean isle. \u201cI was really scared,\u201d Kamaras, 34, from Sierra Leone, says, dazed and disoriented from the journey, his face covered by a surgical mask handed to him by the Greek police. \u201cOur engine was really weak, we were in the boat for four hours and all the time I thought, what if I die,\u201d he murmurs, raising a right hand with all five fingers missing, the price he says he has paid in torture for political opposition. \u201cBut I had spent six months in Istanbul. I had waited a long time for this day.\u201d Kamaras\u2019 chance to traverse the sea came last week when, in a move of unexpected brinkmanship, Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, vowed to \u201copen the doors\u201d for migrants to enter Europe in retaliation for the EU failing to support Ankara in Syria. While thousands headed towards Greece\u2019s land frontier others, like Kamaras, made for the Turkish coast. In echoes of the 2015 refugee crisis, when close to a million displaced Syrians entered Europe via Lesbos and adjacent Aegean isles, as many as 150,000 are now thought to have gathered on the country\u2019s western shores in the hope of crossing. By nightfall, ever growing numbers of women and children had reportedly joined those grouped on beaches opposite the outposts, despite the Greek government rushing to make a defensive ring of naval vessels and coastguard ships around the isles. An all-out drive to create crudely made inflatables has also been launched as traffickers amass in the area. Sgt Panaghiotis Fykias, a veteran of that crisis, fears the worst. Seconded to the local police department\u2019s immigration sector, Fykias makes countless trips patrolling Lesbos\u2019 sealine every day in his battered Citro\u00ebn. On Sunday, what greeted him barely an hour after his 6.30am shift began was a surprise even for him. \u201cOne after the other the boats were coming in,\u201d he says stopping at a beach strewn with the remains of rubber dinghies, life jackets, the inner tubes of tyres, blankets, food and clothes. \u201cTo be honest I am not hopeful. Today, for the first time, I was taken back to 2015. The winds had dropped, the weather was perfect [for the crossing] but if these flows continue, the omens aren\u2019t good. It\u2019s explosive. There are 27,000 migrants here and residents have lost patience. The situation could easily get out of control.\u201d The first officer to arrive at the scene when reports emerged of a boat landing close to the Statue of Liberty \u2013 the showpiece sculpture within metres of the harbour of Mytilene, the island\u2019s capital \u2013 Fykias encountered people as much elated as exhausted. \u201cThere were pregnant women among them, lots of children, faces that looked so very tired,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with coronavirus we have a procedure now, to hand out face masks, head count and put them on buses for Moria camp.\u201d In a sign of the brewing tensions on the island, that now appears to be anything but easy. Enraged at the sight of more migrants arriving locals moved to set up road blocks to prevent them even getting to the vastly overcrowded holding facility. In other unprecedented scenes, assailants rounded on volunteers with an aid organisation, beating them up in broad daylight. \u201cIf we let one bus through, it will be the beginning of the end,\u201d Yannis Mastroyiannis, the community head of Moria\u2019s hilltop village insisted. Fourteen hours after landing in Lesbos, Kamaras had not moved further than a few meters away from the statue. His bus, like others carrying the newly arrived, had been held up by roadblocks and returned to a guarded area in the harbour. It was his first taste of Europe\u2019s promised land.",

Pep Guardiola and his players deal only in the hard currency of domestic silverware and they extended their grip on it via a performance of near suffocating control.</p> <p>It was important to add the qualification. Goals from Sergio Aguero and Rodri had put City in charge and, although Mbwana Samatta halved the deficit against the run of play at the end of the first-half, it looked as though Villa would be some way from the equaliser. Guardiola\u2019s team called the tune for so long that it was almost impossible to foresee the drama at the very end.

It was their fifth League Cup, destined to squeeze into their trophy cabinet alongside their seven league titles, seven FA Cups and one European Cup. That season they finished fourth in the league while Manchester City were relegated on goal difference, after an infamous final-day 2-2 draw with Liverpool in which they timewasted towards the end in the mistaken belief that a point would see them safe. in 1996 City had two league titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups and the European Cup-Winners\u2019 Cup to their name. Judge it any way you like (except head-to-head results, to be fair - City only won nine games that season but two of them were against Villa), at that point in their history Villa were the better club. </p> <p>Fast forward 24 years, time in which Villa haven\u2019t won anything and City have won it all and on multiple occasions (domestically, at least), and everything has changed. City won the two league meetings this season by an aggregate score of 9-1, and Villa are the side fighting relegation. Villa have lost their last three; City have just beaten Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u. You can get odds of 14-1 against a Villa win, while City are 1-6 if you\u2019re lucky.</p> <p>Anything could happen at Wembley today, but one outcome seems by a margin the most likely. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/29/watford-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Watford\u2019s logic-defying 3-0 thumping of Liverpool</a> last night might have given the underdogs some hope; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/18/manchester-city-win-treble-watford-fa-cup-final-match-report\">Watford\u2019s 6-0 thrashing by City</a> in last season\u2019s FA Cup final might have given them some nightmares.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. For all that it was won by the overwhelming favourites after they scored a couple of earlyish goals, it was a fine and compelling final. I leave you with some reminders of a few previous belting League Cup climaxes, and a reminder that the match report can be found here. Bye! Raheem Sterling has a chat: It\u2019s always a pleasure coming to Wembley and even better to win it. Can never get enough. It was good. I thought we made it difficult for ourselves at times, but we\u2019ve done the job and we were professional. The league was difficult this year. We\u2019ve won one title so far but we\u2019re still in the running for two more. We\u2019re fully focused and ready to do the business. We know as a team, if we\u2019re not in the running for one there\u2019s always a couple more. We\u2019ve just got to keep focused and that what we\u2019ve done here. It\u2019s so hard to do that for three years on the bounce and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done, so we\u2019ll just keep doing it, keep trying to win trophies. David Hytner has filed his match report from Wembley: Manchester City had no time for the romance of Aston Villa\u2019s Carabao Cup final story. Pep Guardiola and his players deal only in the hard currency of domestic silverware and they extended their grip on it via a performance of near suffocating control. It was important to add the qualification. Goals from Sergio Aguero and Rodri had put City in charge and, although Mbwana Samatta halved the deficit against the run of play at the end of the first-half, it looked as though Villa would be some way from the equaliser. Guardiola\u2019s team called the tune for so long that it was almost impossible to foresee the drama at the very end. But as City failed to score again, the drama did come. Much more here: Pep Guardiola is pleased: Three times in a row is a big success. It\u2019s a consistency, incredible. It was awesome. We struggled in the first minutes, they had two clear chances. But we played really well, especially second half with 2-1, sometimes you don\u2019t know if you attack or stick with the result. We had to score more, but the game was good. We didn\u2019t know if they played with five at the back or four at the back, with four you can do it [overload on the flanks]. We try to win every competition. Being here, winning means a lot. City go up to take their medals and lift the trophy! It looks like Phil Foden comes back down with the Alan Hardaker Trophy, as the man-of-the-match award in this match is otherwise known, after a fine display in an unfamiliar position on the right flank. Villa trudge up to collect their runners-up medals. The match stats paint a one-sided picture, but Villa clung on and kept scrapping to the last. Villa\u2019s squad huddle while Dean Smith delivers a post-match morale-boosting address. They showed plenty of fight and heart here, and will have to produce a lot more of both in their pursuit of Premier League survival. Manchester City win their third successive League Cup, their fourth in five years and their fifth in seven. But Villa emerge with dignity not just intact but enhanced by a close and tense final, with a particularly exciting second half. 90+6 mins: De Bruyne leads and messes up a five-on-two break, but time\u2019s up for Villa, and it\u2019s City\u2019s trophy! 90+4 mins: City win the header, and eventually clear. The ball is flung back into the mixer, and two Hourihane crosses pick out black shirts. 90+4 mins: With 90 seconds of stoppage time to play, Villa win another corner. The keeper\u2019s coming up! 90+2 mins: Villa win the ball, hit it long, and then don\u2019t even challenge Fernandinho for the header. De Bruyne is then pushed to the ground by Mings on the halfway line, leading to another yellow card. 90+2 mins: City have the ball by the left-hand corner flag, and them seem happy for it to stay there. 90+1 mins: Into stoppage time, and there\u2019ll be five minutes of it! 90 mins: Save! Sterling slides the ball across from the right, and Bernardo Silva\u2019s low shot is straight at Nyland, who saves with his legs! 89 mins: Blue Moon rings out around Wembley. Can City still be denied? 88 mins: They hit the post! It\u2019s an excellent cross, and from the six-yard line Engels heads, Bravo pushes it onto the woodwork, and City clear! 87 mins: Villa are now playing with a front five, and they combine to win a corner. 85 mins: Sterling cuts onto his right foot and shoots high from the edge of the area. Villa have five minutes to work out how to get the ball into the City half and then keep it there for long enough for someone to score. 84 mins: Gabriel Jesus replaces Aguero, who hasn\u2019t moved freely since that foot-slipping, side-net-hitting incident. 83 mins: All the action is at the wrong end from Villa\u2019s point of view. A Foden cross brings another corner. 82 mins: Bernardo Silva gets to the byline again. This time he cuts back, but hits his cross into Mings. 81 mins: Aguero hits the side netting! Bernardo Silva surges to the byline on the left and chips into the penalty area, where Aguero volleys just wide! His standing leg seems to slide from underneath him as he does so, which doesn\u2019t help. 80 mins: Ten minutes to go and Villa are still in this, which didn\u2019t look likely for much of the first half. They\u2019re not really creating, but there\u2019s time. 79 mins: A final change for the Villa, with Samatta going off and Keinan Davis coming on. 78 mins: City win a corner, and then another corner. From the second one De Bruyne crosses and Nyland completely fails to take a straightforward catch at waist height, spilling the ball only just out of Sterling\u2019s bootspace. 76 mins: A Silva swap for City, with David off and Bernardo on. Fernandinho takes the armband. 75 mins: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the font. City\u2019s kit says \u2018Carabao Cup Final v Aston Villa\u2019. That\u2019s just bad and/or lazy writing, not to mention confusing to the casual observer,\u201d writes Leo Addor. Indeed. Carabao Cup Final aren\u2019t even playing in this match. 74 mins: Save! City win a corner, and Rodri meets it at the far post and heads low towards the near corner, by Nyland pushes it round the post! 73 mins: Replays show it wasn\u2019t all that two-footed after all. Full-throttle, for sure, but a fair challenge in my book. 72 mins: Nakamba challenges Aguero for the ball. It looks quite two-footed, but he gets all of the ball before any of the man. The crowd bay for a red card, the referee gives a yellow. 69 mins: A double change for Villa: Elmohamady is replaced by Trezeguet, and Conor Hourihane comes on for El Ghazi. 68 mins: Elmohamady runs 30 yards just to kick David Silva\u2019s ankles, and is booked. 68 mins: Villa are committing more numbers to attack, which is giving City space to attack. De Bruyne has a pretty easy pass to Sterling as City break, but Mings intercepts. 66 mins: Never mind the football, Villa have definitely won the font-size match. Still lots of words, but less obtrusive. 65 mins: Villa win a free-kick on the right, but Grealish lifts it over everyone and out for a goal-kick. 64 mins: I was very picky about Villa\u2019s pre-match footwear earlier, but I haven\u2019t yet complained about the font size of the match-specific blurb on City\u2019s kit. It\u2019s just wildly excessive, and makes the whole shirt look overcrowded and messy and all-round bad. 62 mins: Mings slides across to stop Aguero tapping in De Bruyne\u2019s low cross from the right! There\u2019s a goal in the air right now. 60 mins: Rodri is booked for stopping Douglas Luiz from leading a Villa break, after De Bruyne fell over when in possession. 59 mins: A cross from the left comes through to Foden beyond the far post, and Targett comes across to block his goalbound shot! 58 mins: City bring De Bruyne on for Gundogan. 57 mins: Yellow card! When Guilbert gets the ball a minute later Sterling comes across to challenge, runs into him and gets booked! 56 mins: Guilbert shoves the ball into Sterling\u2019s chest as City prepare to take a throw-in. Weird, and not very gentlemanly conduct, which the referee sees but doesn\u2019t punish. 53 mins: Nearly another! Mings wins the header but the ball bounces to Foden, whose half-volley bounces just wide! 52 mins: City break, and Villa make various attempts to foul various members of their team before the referee finally gives one. They have a free-kick, 30 yards out. 51 mins: Decent, battling, high-tempo play by Villa, but Elmohamady overhits his cross from the right at the end of it. 48 mins: Foden still seems to be in a permanent pocket of space, worryingly. He cuts infield, using Walker\u2019s storming run as a decoy, and then shoots into a defender from 20-odd yards. 46 mins: Peeeeep! It\u2019s on! And within 30 seconds Sterling is released down the left, but Guilbert throws himself to the ground and the referee gives the free-kick. The players are back out and ready for more. Villa stand 45 minutes (and a couple of unanswered goals) from history. Can they possibly do it? Time to carpe this diem. It\u2019s still hard, on balance of play, to see anything other than a City win here. But half-time gives Villa a chance to tighten a listing defensive ship, and from there all it takes is another stumble. 45+1 mins: Villa make it to the interval without further drama, and thanks to Stones\u2019 stumble are neither dead nor buried at the break. 45 mins: \u201cI don\u2019t think VAR checks these kinds of decisions, but surely reviewing that incorrect corner decision that led to City\u2019s second goal would have taken only a few seconds, and would instantly have corrected a clear and obvious error?\u201d says Fraser Leggat. It\u2019s a nastily complicated business, this VAR, and I sympathise with all those tasked with deciding the rules, but some of the boundary-setting does seem a little puzzling. 42 mins: Villa were looking forlorn, but suddenly they\u2019re back in it, and have given themselves a perfect half-timely boost (subject to them holding out until half-time, obviously). John Stones should deal with a bouncing throw-in, but instead he falls over, leaving El Ghazi free to run down the left and cross. It\u2019s a good one, and Samatta dives to send it past Bravo! 40 mins: Villa need to be playing with a back six when they\u2019re out of possession, with left and right midfielders dropping back to cover the space on the flanks that the full-backs are leaving as they\u2019re dragged infield. 38 mins: Zinchenko is found in space on the left. His pull-back finds Sterling, but instead of just shooting he tries to dribble past a few defenders, and eventually loses the ball. 37 mins: Fed up with all the fancy passing and clever angles, Kyle Walker blasts a shot high and wide from 35 yards. 36 mins: Gundogan lifts a lovely 40-yard pass to Foden, who has made another untracked run from the right, but City can\u2019t convert the chance. 34 mins: This is tough on Villa, but they have been far too passive, and in particular are completely failing to track Foden\u2019s runs off the right. 30 mins: Grealish challenges Gundogan on the right. The ball rebounds off him, back into Gundogan and out of play, definitely a goal kick. The officials mess up the decision, and then Villa mess up their marking. Rodri runs from the far post to the near and heads unchallenged into the far corner! A second, as City score from a corner that should have been a goal kick! 29 mins: Foden\u2019s cross from the right comes through to Sterling, who lays off to Aguero. Engels absolutely flings himself in the way of the shot, which hits his back and rebounds to (temporary) safety. 27 mins: Sterling has a shot from 20 yards or so, which zips wide of the near post. 25 mins: As Gary Neville points out on Sky, Aguero keeps taking up a position on the left of City\u2019s forward line, forcing Guilbert infield to track him, and leaving Sterling in space on the flank. 23 mins: A decent if not wildly threatening spell of possession for Villa, who twice get the ball to the left-hand edge of the penalty area but can\u2019t work a chance, and in the end El Ghazi has a shot from wide on the left that Bravo saves easily. 20 mins: Sterling runs down the left and the attention of the Villa defence goes with him. He plays infield to Rodri, who chips over the defence into the path of Foden\u2019s excellent and untracked run on the right side of the area, and he heads back to Aguero, who volleys into Mings\u2019 calf as the defender tries to block. The ball bounces down and past Nyland! A lovely opening goal from Manchester City! 17 mins: Villa are an eighth of the way to a penalty shoot-out. 15 mins: Villa are sitting very deep, letting City play in front of them while they sit in two banks of loads on the edge of their penalty area. So far, so good. 12 mins: Rodri pokes a pass to Sterling that forces the Englishman to turn back instead of running into the area. He is absolutely furious about it, and makes his anger clear even before the ball arrives at his feet, and more so when it\u2019s taken off him and booted clear by a defender. 10 mins: The corner is cleared but City send the ball back in, and Aguero\u2019s header drifts onto the roof of the net. 8 mins: Foden does brilliantly to stay on his feet as various Villa players tried to take his legs out from underneath him, and City\u2019s counter-attack ends with David Silva laying back to Zinchenko, whose 20-yarder was pretty rubbish but cleared behind for a corner. 6 mins: Positive play from Villa, for whom Samatta sends in a low cross from the left, but Fernandinho is the only player who anticipated it and he clears. 5 mins: City win their first corner. Gundogan takes it and Rodri wins the header, sending the ball looping up, away from goal, and out for a goal kick. 3 mins: Chance! Villa work the ball back towards the box, where Ahmed Elmohamady chips in a cross and El Ghazi heads just over the bar! It would have taken a very good header to score from there, and that was not one. 3 mins: Targett swings it towards the far post, where Bravo punches away. 2 mins: Frederic Guilbert takes a long throw, which Rodri heads behind for a corner. Set pieces could be key for them, you\u2019d have thought. 1 min: Peeeeeep! It\u2019s on! Manchester City\u2019s captain, David Silva, has won the coin toss. Looks like Villa are going to kick off. The national anthem has been sung, led by a pair of identical-twin sopranos. Like you do. They surely can\u2019t think of many more reasons to put off the football, so I\u2019m expecting kick-off to happen any moment now. Mr Carabao and some of his friends are also getting in on the handshake act. The players are on their way out! Action will be under way just as soon as the enormous pitch-coverings have been rolled away and everybody\u2019s had a little handshake. \u201cI would say the more finals you play the more comfortable you are, but every final is different,\u201d says Pep Guardiola, for whom this is final No25. Dean Smith has a chat about why he felt the need to remodel his defence: I just felt we needed to. We\u2019d conceded too many chances in our last two games, and were toying with changing back from a three to a four. We did it after 60 minutes and it was better against Southampton, so I just feel as a group they\u2019re more comfortable in that system. \u201c\u2018Amazing players out, amazing players in\u2019? Let me fix that for you. \u2018Amazing players out, amazing players and Claudio Bravo in,\u2019\u201d writes JR. \u201cBut seriously, I always look forward to seeing Bravo play. I love the feeling of knowing that anything is possible. (And I\u2019m with you on the footwear. It\u2019s shocking. I don\u2019t know who decided that\u2019s okay because it isn\u2019t.)\u201d Anyway, those teams then. Manchester City have made eight changes to the team that started at Real Madrid in midweek, with Ederson, Nicolas Otamendi, Aymeric Laporte, Benjamin Mendy, Riyad Mahrez, Kevin de Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus and Bernardo Silva all dropping out, and Claudio Bravo, John Stones, Fernandinho, Phil Foden, Oleksandr Zinchenko, David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling coming in. So, in short, amazing players out, amazing players in. Aston Villa, meanwhile, have Orjan Nyland in goal instead of Pepe Reina, and Bjorn Engels and Ahmed Elmohamady both come in, replacing Kortney Hause, who has started (and indeed finished) their last 11 league games and all but one match of their League Cup run, and Ezri Konsa, who has started their last nine league games and played every minute of their cup run. Hause was interviewed by the Birmingham Express &amp; Star this week and seemed to think he would be involved (\u201cAll we can do is try our best and show character and try not to respect them as much. If you look at the matches we have done well in we have outrun the opposition, played more intent and enthusiasm. You have to do the dirty, nasty side of the game. That gives you the platform\u201d), but today he\u2019s not even on the bench. City\u2019s players have indeed turned up. No suits for them: I haven\u2019t seen any evidence that the Manchester City team has turned up yet, but I guess I\u2019d have heard about it if they hadn\u2019t. Terry: Yeah, but have you seen what they\u2019ve got on their feet? Take my sartorial advice at your absolute peril, but I\u2019m really thrown by that footwear decision. The team sheets have been handed in, and these were the names upon them: Aston Villa: Nyland, Guilbert, Engels, Mings, Targett, Nakamba, Douglas Luiz, Elmohamady, Grealish, El Ghazi, Samatta. Subs: Taylor, Lansbury, Hourihane, Konsa, Trezeguet, Reina, Davis. Man City: Bravo, Walker, Stones, Fernandinho, Zinchenko, Gundogan, Rodri, Silva, Sterling, Aguero, Foden. Subs: Gabriel Jesus, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Mendy, Mahrez, Otamendi, Ederson. Referee: Lee Mason. Cup final matchday attire is a big question for occasional finalists. It looks like it\u2019s suits yes, socks no for Aston Villa: Hello world! It is nearly a quarter of a century since Aston Villa thumped Leeds United to win what was then known as the Coca-Cola Cup. It was their fifth League Cup, destined to squeeze into their trophy cabinet alongside their seven league titles, seven FA Cups and one European Cup. That season they finished fourth in the league while Manchester City were relegated on goal difference, after an infamous final-day 2-2 draw with Liverpool in which they timewasted towards the end in the mistaken belief that a point would see them safe. in 1996 City had two league titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups and the European Cup-Winners\u2019 Cup to their name. Judge it any way you like (except head-to-head results, to be fair - City only won nine games that season but two of them were against Villa), at that point in their history Villa were the better club. Fast forward 24 years, time in which Villa haven\u2019t won anything and City have won it all and on multiple occasions (domestically, at least), and everything has changed. City won the two league meetings this season by an aggregate score of 9-1, and Villa are the side fighting relegation. Villa have lost their last three; City have just beaten Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u. You can get odds of 14-1 against a Villa win, while City are 1-6 if you\u2019re lucky. Anything could happen at Wembley today, but one outcome seems by a margin the most likely. Watford\u2019s logic-defying 3-0 thumping of Liverpool last night might have given the underdogs some hope; Watford\u2019s 6-0 thrashing by City in last season\u2019s FA Cup final might have given them some nightmares. Does this Villa team have one massive upset in them? We\u2019re about to find out.",

      "bodyText": "At least 80,000 Uighurs have been transferred from Xinjiang province, some of them directly from detention centres, to factories across China that make goods for dozens of global brands, according to a report from the Canberra-based Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). Using open-source public documents, satellite imagery, and media reports, the institute identified 27 factories in nine Chinese provinces that have used labourers transferred from re-education centres in Xinjiang since 2017 as part of a programme known as \u201cXinjiang aid\u201d. In conditions that \u201cstrongly suggest forced labour\u201d, the report says, workers live in segregated dormitories, are required to study Mandarin and undergo ideological training. They are frequently subjected to surveillance and barred from observing religious practices. According to government documents analysed by the ASPI, workers are often assigned minders and have limited freedom of movement. The factories were part of supply chains providing goods for 83 global brands, the report found, including Apple, Nike and Volkswagen among others. China has come under mounting international scrutiny for its policies toward Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, where as many as 1.5 million people have been sent to re-education and internment camps. Beijing, which says these facilities are voluntary vocational training centres, has said in recent months that most \u201cstudents\u201d of such centres have \u201cgraduated\u201d and returned to society. The report from the ASPI adds to growing evidence that even after being released from the camps, former detainees are still subject to severe controls and in some cases forced labour. The report\u2019s authors said the actual number of those sent to other parts of China as part of the work programme was \u201clikely to be far higher\u201d than 80,000. \u201cThis report exposes a new phase in China\u2019s social re-engineering campaign targeting minority citizens, revealing new evidence that some factories across China are using forced Uighur labour under a state-sponsored labour transfer scheme that is tainting the global supply chain,\u201d the researchers concluded. Case studies highlighted in the report, titled Uyghurs for Sale, include Qingdao Taekwang Shoes, a factory in eastern China that produces shoes for Nike. The workers were mostly Uighur women from the prefectures of Hotan and Kashgar in southern Xinjiang, and attended night classes whose curriculum was similar to that of the re-education camps. According to government notices, workers were required to attend the \u201cPomegranate Seed\u201d night school, named after a policy that aims to make ethnic minorities and the majority Han Chinese ethnic group as close as the seeds of a pomegranate. At the school, workers study Mandarin, sing the Chinese national anthem and receive \u201cpatriotic education\u201d. Public security and other government workers were to give daily reports on the \u201cthoughts\u201d of the Uighur workers. Advertisements for \u201cgovernment-sponsored Uighur labour\u201d have begun to appear more frequently online, according to the researchers. One ad read: \u201cThe advantages of Xinjiang workers are: semi-military style management, can withstand hardship, no loss of personnel \u2026 minimum order 100 workers!\u201d The report called on China to allow multinational companies unfettered access to investigate any potential instances of abusive or forced labour in factories in China, and for companies to conduct audits and human rights due-diligence inspections. \u201cIt is vital that, as these problems are addressed, Uighur labourers are not placed in positions of greater harm or, for example, involuntarily transferred back to Xinjiang, where their safety cannot necessarily be guaranteed,\u201d it said. An Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, told the Washington Post: \u201cApple is dedicated to ensuring that everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. We have not seen this report but we work closely with all our suppliers to ensure our high standards are upheld.\u201d A Volkswagen spokesman told the paper: \u201cNone of the mentioned supplier companies are currently a direct supplier of Volkswagen.\u201d He said: \u201cWe are committed to our responsibility in all areas of our business where we hold direct authority.\u201d A Nike spokeswoman told the Post: \u201cWe are committed to upholding international labour standards globally,\u201d adding that its suppliers are \u201cstrictly prohibited from using any type of prison, forced, bonded or indentured labour\u201d. Kim Jae-min, the chief executive of Taekwang, the QingdaoTaekwang factory\u2019s South Korean parent company, said about 600 Uighurs were among 7,100 workers at the plant, adding that the migrant workers had been brought in to offset local labour shortages.",

It\u2019s going to keep on being present because her brand, I think, exceeds her tennis achievements.\u201d The fascination with Sharapova\u2019s money has always been curious because, as her first Wimbledon experiences showed, so much of it is a simple reflection of a society that values and promotes a certain look. As she has grown into herself the Russian has assumed agency for her brand and harnessed it into new ventures that will keep her busy for long after her career; but she also had opportunities that many other players didn\u2019t. The duality of Sharapova\u2019s image is that while she presents her manicured image away from the courts, what she has brought to the sport is so specific. She burst on to the tour playing vicious, precise tennis and winning the 2004 Wimbledon, 2006 US Open and 2008 Australian Open titles by the time she was 21. Although her shock win against Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final was always hoisted up as her signature victory, even more impressive was the consistency she quickly established as a teenager and how she twice dismantled Justine Henin en route to subsequent titles. Sharapova hit the ball hard and flat and instinctively knew how to construct an aggressive point, but her game was already limited before she returned to the tour in 2009 after shoulder surgery and with her serve diminished. It is difficult to think of many players who would have continued to thrive after a weapon as essential as her serve was affected. No longer able to consistently strike the ball as cleanly, Sharapova simply leaned heavily on her love of a brawl and her street-fighting instincts, battling back to the No 1 ranking after winning the French Open in 2012. Glimpses of the real Sharapova are visible in the long looks down the court, the clenched fist tapping against her thigh, in the way her refusal to make friends enraged. In the midst of an epic three-set match against Agnieszka Radwanska she buried a forehand and bellowed \u201crun, run\u201d across the court. After the French Open crowd booed her in 2008 for no reason she crunched a forehand winner, pivoted on one foot and bellowed \u201cAllez up your fucking ass\u201d. What she brought to the table inspired devotion and loathing, but she made most people feel something. Even as her head-to-head with Serena Williams descended to 2-20 the Russian was a rare player whose presence heightened a moment, who made the most important matches feel even more essential and tense. Sharapova was always a divisive figure but her doping ban cast a shadow over her career. The case itself falls into the grey moral areas of sport \u2013 she was legally taking meldonium for 10 years when it was added to the banned list in 2016 and she immediately committed a doping violation with her first test at the 2016 Australian Open. At the tribunal her agent\u2019s explanation of how they failed to note meldonium\u2019s status change deserved a laugh track. Max Eisenbud explained he usually checked the list while on his annual holiday during the off-season but, because of his divorce, he had forgone that holiday and so he forgot to check.

Everton\u2019s manager was shown a red card after the final whistle by the referee, Christopher Kavanagh, for demanding an explanation over the decision to disallow Harry Maguire\u2019s own goal in the third minute of stoppage time. The prone Gylfi Sigurdsson was clearly in an offside position when Dominic Calvert-Lewin\u2019s shot struck the United defender but lifted his legs out of the way of the ball as the deflection wrong\u2011footed David de Gea. The assistant referee initially awarded the goal only for VAR to rule that Sigurdsson was in De Gea\u2019s line of sight and therefore interfering with play.

Under current rules, sellers pay only 10% on lifetime gains of up to \u00a310m, comparedwith the 20% capital gains tax paid by higher-rate taxpayers.</p> <p>Scrapping the relief would give Sunak extra room for manoeuvre in a budget that is expected to include expensive pledges such as an increase in spending on railways and electric car chargers.</p> <p>The relief is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/scrap-tax-relief-used-by-britains-richest-urges-former-hmrc-head\">aimed at incentivising </a>people to create new businesses. It was introduced by Gordon Brown\u2019s Labour government in 2008, and was expanded by the Conservative government after 2010.</p> <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank has previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/21/entrepreneurs-tax-break-fails-to-boost-investment-says-ifs\">strongly criticised the relief</a>, saying it was not well targeted and that it caused distortions in the tax system.</p> <p>The IFS said last week that scrapping it would make the tax system \u201cmore equitable and more efficient\u201d. It said 5,000 individuals made an average tax saving of \u00a3350,000 in 2017\u201318 tax year \u2013 meaning they gained three-quarters of the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/837766/191009_Bulletin_FINAL.pdf\">\u00a32.3bn cost</a> of the relief. The Resolution Foundation last month said <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/press-releases/new-chancellor-set-for-a-modest-fiscal-windfall-but-tough-choices-remain/\">\u00a33bn could be raised</a> by scrapping it.</p> <p>\u201cThere are plenty of tax rises which would both raise revenue from better off individuals and improve the coherence of the tax system,\u201d said Paul Johnson, director at the IFS. \u201cTop of the list should be the abolition of the misleadingly named entrepreneurs\u2019 relief.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the plans to scrap it have alarmed some business groups.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor is planning to scrap a \u00a33bn tax relief that mainly benefits the wealthy in a bid to raise cash for an expected increase in public spending in the budget on 11 March. Rishi Sunak is expected to target entrepreneurs\u2019 relief, a tax break which halves the capital gains tax paid when people sell their businesses. Under current rules, sellers pay only 10% on lifetime gains of up to \u00a310m, comparedwith the 20% capital gains tax paid by higher-rate taxpayers. Scrapping the relief would give Sunak extra room for manoeuvre in a budget that is expected to include expensive pledges such as an increase in spending on railways and electric car chargers. The relief is aimed at incentivising people to create new businesses. It was introduced by Gordon Brown\u2019s Labour government in 2008, and was expanded by the Conservative government after 2010. The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank has previously strongly criticised the relief, saying it was not well targeted and that it caused distortions in the tax system. The IFS said last week that scrapping it would make the tax system \u201cmore equitable and more efficient\u201d. It said 5,000 individuals made an average tax saving of \u00a3350,000 in 2017\u201318 tax year \u2013 meaning they gained three-quarters of the \u00a32.3bn cost of the relief. The Resolution Foundation last month said \u00a33bn could be raised by scrapping it. \u201cThere are plenty of tax rises which would both raise revenue from better off individuals and improve the coherence of the tax system,\u201d said Paul Johnson, director at the IFS. \u201cTop of the list should be the abolition of the misleadingly named entrepreneurs\u2019 relief.\u201d However, the plans to scrap it have alarmed some business groups. Mike Cherry, the national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said scrapping the relief would make \u201ceveryday entrepreneurs\u201d poorer. \u201cOnly around 10% of people who claim this relief are selling businesses worth more than \u00a31m. The vast majority of those who benefit from this incentive \u2013 38,000 each year \u2013 are everyday entrepreneurs.\u201d The Treasury declined to comment.",

To name only two: \u201ctaxing wealth at the same rate as income\u201d \u2013 one doesn\u2019t need to trawl through Thomas Piketty\u2019s monumental works to know that extreme wealth hides and multiplies outside visible income \u2013 and \u201clowering the threshold for union recognition\u201d. These are not mere apple-pie commitments aimed at achieving unity in the party, but specific policies. She even dares to praise the last Labour government\u2019s achievement in poverty reduction. Anyone who has watched Channel 4\u2019s hustings programme should have been delighted by the courtesy, humour and sheer intelligence of the contenders, both in response to the audience and towards each other. Remember the nasty inanity of the Conservative leadership debate last year? Diana Birkett Balham, London \u2022 Attending the Labour hustings in Manchester last Tuesday has encouraged me to stay a member of the party. Although there is no other party I was tempted to join, I was feeling somewhat unsure what my membership was supporting. While my constituency, Warrington North, has stayed Labour, we have lost all those around us. Both Warrington South and Leigh, previously Andy Burnham\u2019s seat, are now Tory. Not only am I staying with Labour, I am certain that voting for Lisa Nandy will make the Labour party exactly what it should be, and hopefully in government. She is keen to have Labour relocate its headquarters to Warrington \u2013 surely a good way to make somewhere other than London he focus of political engagement. Alison Winterburn Warrington \u2022 At last someone in the Labour party has grasped the nettle. \u201cSoon, all politics will be climate politics,\u201d says Rebecca Long-Bailey (The climate should be at the centre of the next election, Journal, 25 February). Here in Mytholmroyd, where our lives are dominated by water, waterworks, roadworks, traffic lights, diggers and skips full of flood-damaged white goods, that day has already arrived. Calderdale council (Labour-controlled) has pledged to run every new policy past climate-based criteria; local Labour groups are talking in detail about semi-permeable dams and upland management, and phrases like \u201ccarbon literacy\u201d and \u201cclimate justice\u201d are in common usage. Please can those who have a vote on the Labour leadership support a candidate with a vision for facing the massive turnaround we must accomplish within the next decade. Alison Leonard Mytholmroyd, West Yorkshire \u2022 As a Labour member, I\u2019ve been receiving emails from the candidates for leadership and deputy. The first email from a leadership candidate was from Rebecca Long-Bailey on 19 February, with messages over the next two days from Lisa Nandy and Keir Starmer respectively. I then received an email on 25 February from John McDonnell (subject line \u201cI\u2019m voting for Rebecca Long-Bailey\u201d), followed the next day by one from Team Labour, explaining that McDonnell\u2019s email had come from them and correcting the Long-Bailey weblink. This was just the day before I received my email voting form. Three emails sent for Long-Bailey, the candidate favoured by Jeremy Corbyn, McDonnell and Momentum; only one sent for the other two candidates. Team Labour have been far from independent and even-handed.

Another Home Office permanent secretary, Sir John Gieve, lost the trust of his boss, Charles Clarke, after a series of institutional failings in the early 2000s, with both Gieve and later Clarke moving on from the department. Then there was the departure of Brodie Clark, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/nov/08/brodie-clark-resigns-theresa-may\" title=\"\">resigned</a> as head of the Border Agency after falling out with the then-home secretary, Theresa May.

It is not unknown for a permanent secretary and secretary of state to fall out, even when it\u2019s as badly as Patel and Rutnam seem to have done. But it really is unknown for it to end up in quite such an explosive resignation statement, let alone for an outgoing permanent secretary to bring a case of constructive dismissal.</p> <p>The war of words will doubtless continue.

In turn, Rutnam has been accused of failures in managing the department, and his leadership is expected to come under heavy criticism in the forthcoming review of the Windrush scandal.

      "bodyText": "As Chris Froome and his Team Ineos colleagues flew home from the coronavirus lockdown at the UAE Tour after being given the all-clear, a decision was expected on Monday on whether the major Italian races scheduled for this month will go ahead. Italy is struggling to contain the outbreak which has resulted in several towns in the Lombardy region being placed in quarantine. The UAE Tour race caravan was placed in lockdown from Thursday until Sunday as more than 600 riders, team staff, officials, and media were tested, after reports that two members of one of the teams had tested positive for the virus. The race was cancelled two days before the finish with the overall title awarded to Adam Yates. The Italian races under threat include the opening one-day Classic of the season, Milan-San Remo, on 21 March, the Strade Bianche one\u2011day race on 7 March and the Tirreno\u2011Adriatico stage race on 11-17 March. \u201cWe cannot officially say yet that the races are cancelled,\u201d said the Belgian official Tom Van Damme, head of the Union Cycliste Internationale\u2019s road race commission. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say that but the teams will be informed in good time. There\u2019s no doubt an official decision will be taken on Monday. It\u2019s not really a matter for the race organisers RCS, it\u2019s the public bodies that are looking after the situation who will take the decision.\u201d To complicate the picture, key members of the Italian organisers RCS remained stuck in the United Arab Emirates where they also run the national Tour. Although Froome and others had been placed in the clear, it was reported that four teams \u2013 Groupama-FDJ, Cofidis, Deceuninck-Quickstep and Gazprom-RusVelo \u2013 were being kept in quarantine pending further tests. Team UAE Emirates, who are sponsored by the Gulf nation, stated all their riders and staff had tested negative for the virus but the team had chosen to remain in the UAE to be examined further. \u201cDespite being given the green light to travel home and the last tests carried out coming back negative, our team has decided to extend their stay in the UAE to continue testing everyone\u2019s conditions and go home only with the safety of non-contagion,\u201d read the statement. \u201cIn light of some known cases of flu within our group and other teams, we will be tested again in the next few days.\u201d Meanwhile, at the world track championships in Berlin, Great Britain closed out a frustrating week with a gold medal on the final day when Elinor Barker gained two laps to score a clear victory in the points race. It was her second win in the event in four years and means the Welshwoman has been GB\u2019s only gold medallist at the past two world track championships. Barker was the exception in a week when many of the British team looked outgunned, a situation summed up by a single moment just after halfway through the men\u2019s Madison relay on Sunday when the British team of Ethan Hayter and Ollie Wood were painfully unable to hang on to the winning Danish team of Lasse-Norman Hansen and Michael Markov \u2013 the latter just in from the UAE Tour and riding after a period of quarantine in his Berlin hotel \u2013 when they piled on the pressure with the Spanish, Dutch and Germans. In the final women\u2019s sprint event, Katie Marchant was edged out in the semi-final of the keirin, finishing eighth. While the women\u2019s team pursuit and men\u2019s team sprint posted silver-medal rides that bode well for the run-in to Tokyo, Matt Walls secured a bronze in the omnium and Jack Carlin finished just outside the medals in the keirin, there is obvious ground to make up for much of the team. Great Britain proved unable to win a gold medal at the world championships in any of the 12 Olympic events for the second year running, but this is in ominous contrast to the past three world championships in Olympic years when the team scored nine, five and three golds in Olympic disciplines.

The US is also committed to work with allies to reduce the number of coalition forces, if the Taliban adheres to security guarantees and ceasefire. If so, a full withdrawal of all US and coalition forces will occur within 14 months.</p> <p>The Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and imposed draconian restrictions on women\u2019s rights and activities it deemed un-Islamic. After being ousted in a US-led invasion following the 9/11 attacks engineered by al-Qaida forces harboured by the Taliban, the Taliban led a long and violent insurgency.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/29/us-taliban-agreement-reaction-pompeo-trump-allies\">Trump ally Graham and ex-aide Bolton voice concerns over Taliban deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe Bush administration and the Obama administration both tried to get the words that were on the paper yesterday that the Taliban would break from al-Qaida publicly,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWe got that.

Pompeo gave no date for a Trump meeting with Taliban leaders, which the president promised at the White House on Saturday. The deal faces criticism at home but in Kabul, Ghani told reporters: \u201cThe government of Afghanistan has made no commitment to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners.\u201d Under the accord, the US and the Taliban are committed to work expeditiously to release combat and political prisoners as a confidence-building measure, with the coordination and approval of all sides. The agreement calls for up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners to be released in exchange for up to 1,000 Afghan government captives by 10 March. Ghani said it was \u201cnot in the authority of United States to decide\u201d about the swap, because it was \u201conly a facilitator\u201d. Speaking to CNN, the Afghan president said Trump had not asked for the release of the prisoners and the issue should be discussed as part of a comprehensive peace deal. \u201cThe political consensus \u2026 that would be needed for such a major step does not exist today,\u201d he said. Ghani said key issues need to be discussed first, including the Taliban\u2019s ties with Pakistan and other countries that had offered it sanctuary, its ties with what he called terrorist groups and drug cartels, and the place of Afghan security forces and its civil administration. \u201cThe people of Afghanistan need to believe that we\u2019ve gone from war to peace, and not that the agreement will be either a Trojan horse or the beginning of a much worse phase of conflict,\u201d he said. Pompeo said that though the Taliban \u201chave an enormous amount of American blood on their hands\u201d, they \u201chave now made the break. They\u2019ve said they will not permit terror to be thrust upon anyone, including the United States, from Afghanistan.\u201d Saturday\u2019s accord was signed in Doha by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, witnessed by Pompeo. Pompeo said he met \u201ca senior Taliban negotiator\u201d. Baradar met foreign ministers from Norway, Turkey and Uzbekistan and diplomats from Russia, Indonesia and other nations. \u201cThe dignitaries who met Mullah Baradar expressed their commitments towards Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction and development \u2026 the US-Taliban agreement is historical,\u201d said Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid. In the US, Republicans in Congress expressed concerns about the logistics of the deal and trusting the Taliban, while Democrats demanded congressional involvement. In a Saturday briefing at the White House, Trump rejected all criticism and said he would meet Taliban leaders. Aides to Ghani said Trump\u2019s decision to meet the Taliban could pose a challenge to Afghanistan\u2019s government at a time when the US troop withdrawal is imminent. Washington is committed to reducing troops to 8,600 from 13,000 within 135 days of signing the deal. The US is also committed to work with allies to reduce the number of coalition forces, if the Taliban adheres to security guarantees and ceasefire. If so, a full withdrawal of all US and coalition forces will occur within 14 months. The Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and imposed draconian restrictions on women\u2019s rights and activities it deemed un-Islamic. After being ousted in a US-led invasion following the 9/11 attacks engineered by al-Qaida forces harboured by the Taliban, the Taliban led a long and violent insurgency. \u201cThe Bush administration and the Obama administration both tried to get the words that were on the paper yesterday that the Taliban would break from al-Qaida publicly,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWe got that. That\u2019s important. Now, time will tell if they\u2019ll live up to that commitment is our expectation. They have promised us they will do so and we\u2019ll be able to see on the ground everything they do or choose not to do.\u201d The Afghan war, easily America\u2019s longest, has been a stalemate for more than 18 years. More than 2,400 Americans have been killed and more than 20,000 wounded. As of October 2019, more than 43,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed. Talks between Afghan government and Taliban groups will be \u201crocky and bumpy\u201d, Pompeo said. \u201cNo one is under any false illusion that this won\u2019t be a difficult conversation. But that conversation for the first time in almost two decades will be among the Afghan people.\u201d",

Many besides Johnson, Blair and Cameron have been prime ministers with relatively young children. Even those who came into No 10 with children in their 20s such as Harold Macmillan liked to fill the house with children\u2019s parties, just to lighten the sombre mood the place can exude, especially at weekends.</p> <p>Not that these celebrations with the progeny of politicians always go smoothly. In her new memoir, Kate Fall, David Cameron\u2019s deputy chief of staff, recalls a weekend at Chequers where one of Michael Gove\u2019s children marched into the room followed by a flustered Cameron child saying: \u201cIt\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it, this will be our house when Daddy become prime minister?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbcd6da8e4aa025ef9f5dd857c3c9184254005dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbcd6da8e4aa025ef9f5dd857c3c9184254005dc/1_191_3538_2124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron leaving No 10 for the last time as prime minister with Samantha and their children\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron leaving No 10 for the last time as prime minister with Samantha and their children on 13 July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Dempsey/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sajid Javid\u2019s 10-year-old daughter, Maya, has also left some pointed advice hidden in a book in Dorneywood, the government grace and favour mansion in Buckinghamshire, on how prime ministers should treat their chancellors.</p> <p>However, some children such as Carol Thatcher did suffer but whether that was the mother or the home can be disputed. Lord Butler, once Margaret Thatcher\u2019s principal private secretary, recently recalled vividly \u201cgoing up to the flat and into the sitting room to discuss some point with Margaret Thatcher and in the course of our discussions I heard a rustling in a cupboard in the corner of the room.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I said: \u2018What is that? Are there mice up here?\u2019 And she said: \u2018No, that\u2019s Carol.\u2019 I said, \u2018Why is Carol in that cupboard?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, you know, she was wearing jeans so I told her to hide herself while you were coming in.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Thatcher\u2019s whole approach to motherhood was flawed, according to her admirer Lord Powell, who served as her foreign policy adviser and private secretary.

      "bodyText": "Days after a shocked Tony Blair, aged 46, and his wife, Cherie, 45, announced that they were to be the parents of the first child born in wedlock to a serving prime minister in more than 150 years, this reporter found himself in the prime minister\u2019s office asking him about his choice of contraceptive. It is probably the first and last time the issue had come up in an interview with a serving prime minister. But my strong memory is that my editor at the time had absolutely no interest in the 2000 London mayoral elections, the ostensible subject of the interview, and only in how Blair, three years into his first term and racked by Northern Ireland, had inadvertently become a father for the fourth time, and what it would mean for his prime ministership. The impact of the patter of tiny feet on the inner workings of No 10 and the decisionmaking of a stressed prime minister has since become a matter of growing curiosity as Britain\u2019s prime ministers, or their wives, have become younger. The Blairs\u2019 surprise fourth child, Leo, delivered by the royal surgeon, Marcus Setchell, managed to survive seven years in No 10 despite a querulous neighbour lobbying for his father to leave the house, and by all accounts is now a well-adjusted boy. He attended his father\u2019s speech last week on 120 years of the Labour party and is, in his dad\u2019s judgment, already an excellent political strategist. So whatever progeny emerges from the union between Boris Johnson and his fianc\u00e9e, Leo is proof that children need not be scarred by being raised in a minor stately home in central London in which abnormality is the rule, and privacy largely dependent on the judgment of newspaper editors. Leo was an exception only in that he, and subsequently Florence, the youngest child of David and Samantha Cameron, were born to serving prime ministers. Many besides Johnson, Blair and Cameron have been prime ministers with relatively young children. Even those who came into No 10 with children in their 20s such as Harold Macmillan liked to fill the house with children\u2019s parties, just to lighten the sombre mood the place can exude, especially at weekends. Not that these celebrations with the progeny of politicians always go smoothly. In her new memoir, Kate Fall, David Cameron\u2019s deputy chief of staff, recalls a weekend at Chequers where one of Michael Gove\u2019s children marched into the room followed by a flustered Cameron child saying: \u201cIt\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it, this will be our house when Daddy become prime minister?\u201d Sajid Javid\u2019s 10-year-old daughter, Maya, has also left some pointed advice hidden in a book in Dorneywood, the government grace and favour mansion in Buckinghamshire, on how prime ministers should treat their chancellors. However, some children such as Carol Thatcher did suffer but whether that was the mother or the home can be disputed. Lord Butler, once Margaret Thatcher\u2019s principal private secretary, recently recalled vividly \u201cgoing up to the flat and into the sitting room to discuss some point with Margaret Thatcher and in the course of our discussions I heard a rustling in a cupboard in the corner of the room. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018What is that? Are there mice up here?\u2019 And she said: \u2018No, that\u2019s Carol.\u2019 I said, \u2018Why is Carol in that cupboard?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, you know, she was wearing jeans so I told her to hide herself while you were coming in.\u2019\u201d Thatcher\u2019s whole approach to motherhood was flawed, according to her admirer Lord Powell, who served as her foreign policy adviser and private secretary. He recently recalled: \u201cThe challenges of being a mother and prime minister were considerable and, to be perfectly frank, she rather failed. She didn\u2019t have time enough for her children. She rather overindulged Mark when she perhaps underindulged Carol.\u201d Some prime ministers never tried to blend No 10 as an office and a family home. Mary Wilson, for instance, installed a doorbell in her second-floor rooms to make sure no civil servant intruded. The only informality came from a dog called Paddy and a cat named Nemo.

In the case of Cameron, this transition was helped by a short whisky and Game of Thrones episode.

Instead, the Drummonds boarded the ship without her, leaving her at the station with \u00a31 in her pocket.</p> <p>The experience of this nameless woman, dumped in a strange country in June 1908, may be shocking, but she was not exceptional. She was one of hundreds, perhaps thousands of <em>ayahs</em> \u2013 Indian nannies (though the name came to refer to other nationalities too) who were brought to Britain by wealthy families as cheap travelling childcare between the 18th and mid-20th centuries. Many were able to make their way home again, but others, discharged on disembarking, found themselves in perilous circumstances \u2013 and in many cases, what became of them is unknown.</p> <p>Eight decades after the <em>ayah</em> system petered out with the collapse of the British empire, an event at Hackney Museum in east London hopes to focus attention once again on these women, and a chapter of Britain\u2019s colonial and migrant history that has been all but forgotten.</p> <p>The initiative behind the event was launched by Farhanah Mamoojee, a 28-year-old from east London who, after hearing a passing mention of the subject on a documentary, was surprised to discover that she lived close to a building that had once served as a hostel for destitute <em>ayahs</em>. The <a href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/ayahs-home\">Ayahs\u2019 Home</a> was established in east London in the 19th century by concerned philanthropists, and two buildings in which it was housed still stand in Hackney.</p> <p>Mamoojee applied to English Heritage for blue plaque recognition (her application has been shortlisted and is under consideration), \u201cbut I thought: it can\u2019t just be me. There must be other people who want to learn about this.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually she reached Rozina Visram, a retired historian who moved to the UK from Zanzibar in the 1970s and began <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/asians/about/aboutaib.html\">researching </a><em><a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/asians/about/aboutaib.html\">ayahs</a></em> after she too became intrigued by brief passing mentions of often nameless Indian childcare workers. She remains the acknowledged authority on the subject.</p> <p>Though the women \u2013 up to 140 of whom are thought to have come to Britain every year \u2013 were extremely isolated and vulnerable, they were not only victims, notes Visram. \u201cYou can imagine how resilient they were. Enterprising, adventurous.\u201d One <em>ayah</em>, Minnie Green, <a href=\"https://womenshistorynetwork.org/black-history-month-ayahs-at-sea/\">took her abusive employers to court and won</a>. Another, Mrs Anthony Pareira, is recorded as making the months-long voyage between India and Britain <a href=\"https://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/oms/a-home-for-the-ayahs-\">54 times</a>, choosing to make a career out of onboard childcare.</p> <p>\u201cBut of course we don\u2019t have their voices,\u201d says Visram. \u201cThey were working-class, and working-class people always disappear from history because they don\u2019t write things down. And being women, there are also gender issues. So we just don\u2019t know much about their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Inspired by Mamoojee\u2019s enthusiasm, staff at Hackney Museum have begun their own research into the <em>ayahs\u2019</em> history, in the hope of expanding on the material the museum currently displays about the home. \u201cIt has presented quite a challenge, because what information is out there?\u201d says the museum manager, Niti Acharya.</p> <p>She has begun systematically scanning passenger lists and landing cards from the early 20th century for mentions of accompanying <em>ayahs</em>. \u201cOver 95% of those listed are treated almost as possessions of the family they are travelling with \u2013 Ayah Smith, Ayah Leggatt,\u201d says Acharya.</p> <p>Intriguingly, her research so far shows that more came into the country than left. \u201cWhich leads me to ask: of those who did stay, what happened? How did their lives pan out? Did they stay with their families, did they find love and have their own families?\u201d Ironically, when the women did start using a name of their own \u2013 usually an Anglicised given name \u2013 they are impossible to identify any longer as <em>ayahs</em> and often disappear from history.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m ever so pleased that younger people want to know about this,\u201d says Visram, \u201cBut for me, this is not just for Indians. Because after all, this is not immigrant history \u2013 it is British history, and it should be taught to everybody.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/lost-histories-ayahs-in-london-tickets-89568480737\">Lost </a><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/lost-histories-ayahs-in-london-tickets-89568480737\">Histories: Ayahs in London is at Hackney Museum on 7 March</a></p>",

The experience of this nameless woman, dumped in a strange country in June 1908, may be shocking, but she was not exceptional. She was one of hundreds, perhaps thousands of ayahs \u2013 Indian nannies (though the name came to refer to other nationalities too) who were brought to Britain by wealthy families as cheap travelling childcare between the 18th and mid-20th centuries. Many were able to make their way home again, but others, discharged on disembarking, found themselves in perilous circumstances \u2013 and in many cases, what became of them is unknown. Eight decades after the ayah system petered out with the collapse of the British empire, an event at Hackney Museum in east London hopes to focus attention once again on these women, and a chapter of Britain\u2019s colonial and migrant history that has been all but forgotten. The initiative behind the event was launched by Farhanah Mamoojee, a 28-year-old from east London who, after hearing a passing mention of the subject on a documentary, was surprised to discover that she lived close to a building that had once served as a hostel for destitute ayahs. The Ayahs\u2019 Home was established in east London in the 19th century by concerned philanthropists, and two buildings in which it was housed still stand in Hackney. Mamoojee applied to English Heritage for blue plaque recognition (her application has been shortlisted and is under consideration), \u201cbut I thought: it can\u2019t just be me. There must be other people who want to learn about this.\u201d Eventually she reached Rozina Visram, a retired historian who moved to the UK from Zanzibar in the 1970s and began researching ayahs after she too became intrigued by brief passing mentions of often nameless Indian childcare workers. She remains the acknowledged authority on the subject. Though the women \u2013 up to 140 of whom are thought to have come to Britain every year \u2013 were extremely isolated and vulnerable, they were not only victims, notes Visram. \u201cYou can imagine how resilient they were. Enterprising, adventurous.\u201d One ayah, Minnie Green, took her abusive employers to court and won. Another, Mrs Anthony Pareira, is recorded as making the months-long voyage between India and Britain 54 times, choosing to make a career out of onboard childcare. \u201cBut of course we don\u2019t have their voices,\u201d says Visram. \u201cThey were working-class, and working-class people always disappear from history because they don\u2019t write things down. And being women, there are also gender issues. So we just don\u2019t know much about their lives.\u201d Inspired by Mamoojee\u2019s enthusiasm, staff at Hackney Museum have begun their own research into the ayahs\u2019 history, in the hope of expanding on the material the museum currently displays about the home. \u201cIt has presented quite a challenge, because what information is out there?\u201d says the museum manager, Niti Acharya. She has begun systematically scanning passenger lists and landing cards from the early 20th century for mentions of accompanying ayahs. \u201cOver 95% of those listed are treated almost as possessions of the family they are travelling with \u2013 Ayah Smith, Ayah Leggatt,\u201d says Acharya. Intriguingly, her research so far shows that more came into the country than left. \u201cWhich leads me to ask: of those who did stay, what happened? How did their lives pan out? Did they stay with their families, did they find love and have their own families?\u201d Ironically, when the women did start using a name of their own \u2013 usually an Anglicised given name \u2013 they are impossible to identify any longer as ayahs and often disappear from history. \u201cI\u2019m ever so pleased that younger people want to know about this,\u201d says Visram, \u201cBut for me, this is not just for Indians. Because after all, this is not immigrant history \u2013 it is British history, and it should be taught to everybody.\u201d \u2022 Lost Histories: Ayahs in London is at Hackney Museum on 7 March",

Offensive banners insulting Hopp were unveiled by Union Berlin fans just before half-time prompting the referee to stop the game and order the players back into the dressing rooms. Union\u2019s players went over to the home tribune to plead with fans to take down the banners, with captain Christopher Trimmel seen in direct conversation to one of the ultras in a bid to get the game re-started. A later protest against the Deutscher Fu\u00dfball-Bund\u2019s (DFB) position on collective punishments and a perceived \u2018currying of favour\u2019 with Hopp saw the game stopped again as fans were warned that another indiscretion would lead to match being called off. The incidents occurred after similar scenes at Hoffenheim\u2019s Rhein-Neckar-Arena during Bayern Munich\u2019s 6-0 win on Saturday. There Bayern players and executives also tried to intervene to get banners insulting Hoop taken down as the game was held up for 20 minutes.

      "body": "<p>When the cross-party Treasury committee is officially appointed on Monday, one of its first tasks will be to question Andrew Bailey over his role as the next governor of the Bank of England, which he is due to start on 16 March.</p> <p>This is standard procedure for the influential group of MPs, but comes at a time of great challenge for an incoming governor, not least amid the unfolding economic collapse caused by the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>Bailey, who replaces Mark Carney and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/20/andrew-bailey-appointed-head-of-bank-of-england\">chosen as his successor in December by the former chancellor Sajid Javid</a>, will face several urgent tasks in his opening weeks and months as governor to address \u2013 as well as some potentially awkward questions. Here are some of the key subjects the committee is likely to quiz him on.</p> <p><strong>His record<br></strong>When Bailey was appointed he was widely hailed as a \u201csafe pair of hands\u201d. However, critics of his time at the Financial Conduct Authority beg to differ.

      "bodyText": "When the cross-party Treasury committee is officially appointed on Monday, one of its first tasks will be to question Andrew Bailey over his role as the next governor of the Bank of England, which he is due to start on 16 March. This is standard procedure for the influential group of MPs, but comes at a time of great challenge for an incoming governor, not least amid the unfolding economic collapse caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Bailey, who replaces Mark Carney and was chosen as his successor in December by the former chancellor Sajid Javid, will face several urgent tasks in his opening weeks and months as governor to address \u2013 as well as some potentially awkward questions. Here are some of the key subjects the committee is likely to quiz him on. His record When Bailey was appointed he was widely hailed as a \u201csafe pair of hands\u201d. However, critics of his time at the Financial Conduct Authority beg to differ. Gina Miller, the businesswoman best known for her legal challenge to the government\u2019s attempt to push through Brexit without parliamentary approval, is leading a group calling for a review of Bailey\u2019s appointment and has welcomed the Treasury committee\u2019s opportunity to examine his record. Miller has highlighted his reaction to the collapse of investments run by London Capital &amp; Finance, and the liquidation of Neil Woodford\u2019s once-popular flagship investment fund, among other things. \u201cThe hundreds of thousands of Britain\u2019s depositors, savers, investors and pensioners whose lives have been ruined and savings squandered, on Mr Bailey\u2019s watch as CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority, deserve no less,\u201d Miller said. Bailey has argued on many of the issues that the FCA\u2019s statutory powers were limited. However, the scandals have overshadowed his time at the regulator. Coronavirus There are questions about how much the Bank can do to support the economy given the global nature of the coronavirus outbreak and the limited firepower central banks have at their disposal to combat an economic downturn. Bailey arrives with interest rates still close to the lowest levels in the Bank\u2019s 325-year history, at 0.75%, only 0.25 percentage points higher than when Carney started at the Bank almost seven years ago and limiting the scope for further cuts if deemed necessary. Whether Bailey will be able to make much of an inroad into returning rates to more normal levels will be closely watched. Brexit The British economy could be put under renewed strain later this year as the Brexit negotiations gather pace ahead of the deadline for the UK\u2019s exit from the transition period at the end of December, which Boris Johnson has warned he will not extend. Once the dust from the coronavirus outbreak has settled, the path for interest rates and the continued stability of the financial system will partly depend on the nation\u2019s new trading relationship with the EU, and the extent to which there are tougher barriers, friction at Britain\u2019s borders and whether there is a smooth or abrupt transition. Carney had been accused of bringing the central bank\u2019s independence into question, given his repeated warnings about the threat posed by Brexit to the UK economy and banking system. Serving under the government of Boris Johnson, the new governor could face more questions about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU. Climate As governor, Mark Carney brought to the top of the agenda the importance of global heating as a problem for central bankers to address, warning about the existential crisis facing the world financial system. Threadneedle Street is preparing to run a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d climate-related stress test next year, a landmark moment. Bailey will need to show early on that he will take the issue as seriously as his predecessor. Hedge fund scandal Bailey is likely to face questions about the embarrassing revelation about a backup audio feed that without the Bank\u2019s knowledge potentially allowed traders early access to an audio feed of market-moving Bank press conferences. The answers to those questions could have broader implications for how the Bank protects key national infrastructure, amid criticisms of where accountability lies for failures at the institution. Diversity Bailey is set to become the 121st governor \u2013 and the 121st man to take the role. That imbalance is mirrored throughout the top levels of the Bank, with a lack of gender or ethnic diversity in top jobs. There is only one woman, Silvana Tenreyro, on the Bank\u2019s nine-member rate-setting monetary policy committee. Across the Bank Bailey will be pressured to close ethnicity and gender pay gaps, as well as increase representation, which sometimes went backwards during Carney\u2019s tenure. Independence The Bank of England is run at arm\u2019s length from the government to preserve its independence at setting interest rates and producing economic forecasts. As the government expands its spending \u2013 boosting the economy \u2013 the Bank of England may feel the need to raise interest rates to stop inflationary pressures building. That could bring the Bank into conflict with the government and Johnson\u2019s choice as chancellor, Rishi Sunak. How Threadneedle Street and Downing Street work together will be a key question of Bailey\u2019s regime \u2013 and potentially his legacy as governor.",

      "bodyText": "Racism, as Mel Pennant\u2019s new play explores, does not come from nowhere. It is planted by society, its roots extending through soil nurtured by bigoted jokes and casual slurs. A xenophobic gag and a racist murder might not be comparable, but Pennant suggests that they lie on the same continuum. Jackie (Penny Layden) angrily insists that the R-word, as she calls it, does not apply to her and her family.

      "body": "<p>The writer Fiona MacCarthy, who has died aged 80, believed fervently, like her adored William Morris, that design was about the power of choice \u2013 not just what to buy and use, but what to do, how to live; that actively choosing was the core of life.</p> <p>In that belief, she wrote mighty biographies about outsider creators and their difficult choices. Her first major book, which calmly revealed the devout artist Eric Gill as an extreme sexual predator, was an outrageous success in 1989, yet her work most likely to last is the 1994 Morris biography, subtitled A Life for Our Time. She wrote it in <a href=\"https://www.davidmellordesign.com/the-round-building/\" title=\"\">the Round Building complex</a>, Hathersage, near Sheffield, the home and perfect factory that she and her partner, the industrial designer <a href=\"https://www.davidmellordesign.com/david-mellor-biography/\" title=\"\">David Mellor</a>, built in 1990, an exemplar of the balance of craft, domesticity and community Morris had longed for but never quite achieved.</p> <p>MacCarthy tramped Morris\u2019s landscapes (\u201cthings dawn on you just being in the place\u201d), made pilgrimage to his minor works, and understood the contradictions of his politics. The book both recreates his period peculiarity, and is a manifesto for his perpetual modernity; MacCarthy, like Morris, wanted to find out the proper occupation for humans in a mechanical age. She knew purposelessness makes people unhappy.</p> <p>As she explained in her memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/14/highereducation.history\" title=\"\">The Last Curtsey</a> (2006), she had crashed into this world of aesthetic choices from an unlikely height. Her great-grandfather was Sir Robert McAlpine, self-made builder and engineering contractor, whose daughter Agnes married a diplomat, the Baron de Belabre. Their socialite daughter, Yolande, wed a Royal Artillery officer, Gerald MacCarthy, who was killed in action in the North African desert in 1943, leaving adrift Yolande and two children \u2013 Fiona, still a toddler, and her baby sister Karin \u2013 and their nanny.</p> <p>They lived in Kensington, London, then in Scotland and eventually the unfashionable end of Chelsea, camping out during wartime flying bomb attacks in the Dorchester hotel, which McAlpine had built, and where Agnes lived in style. MacCarthy\u2019s earliest memories were of roaming the corridors of \u201cthe Dorch\u201d, observing other well-heeled shelterers.</p> <p>She grew into a natural swot, who set herself alight reading Charlotte Bront\u00eb by the nursery fire and realised that words would be her way out of her stultified world. Her peers believed education superfluous for girls (\u201cfrightfully brainy\u201d was no compliment) but she passed easily from Wycombe Abbey school to Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. Between the two was a term in a Paris flat being \u201cfinished\u201d, plus taking curtsey lessons and making wardrobe purchases (ballgowns, 24 pairs of nylons, five pairs of gloves), before she became one of the 1,400 debutantes presented at court in 1958 in the last official season of cocktail parties, balls and dances.</p> <p>Only four debs went on to university, among them a relieved MacCarthy. After graduation she retained enough conventionality to marry, in 1961, a business executive from a county military family, only to realise at a drunken hunt ball in Chelmsford that being Mrs Ian White-Thompson was \u201clike the season, only worse\u201d, its duration interminable. They later divorced.</p> <p>However, the season had taught her initiative, sociability and networking, useful qualifications for journalism. Besides shrewd words, MacCarthy had an acute visual sense; she had once dumped a teen suitor on seeing his family\u2019s art gallery: \u201cI could never love a boy whose mother dealt in paintings of drinking cardinals.\u201d At Oxford she enjoyed the lectures of its first professor of art history, <a href=\"https://www.hoa.ox.ac.uk/professor-edgar-wind\" title=\"\">Edgar Wind</a>.</p> <p>That commended her to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/02/pressandpublishing1\" title=\"\">Robert Harling</a>, editor of Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s House &amp; Garden, a magazine then less about consumption than intelligent design as a mode of living. He ran the office as \u201can amiable harem, extracting his mini-skirted girl assistants \u2026 for a cappuccino in a nearby coffee bar\u201d, but he recognised talent, and MacCarthy soon moved up from merchandise editor (unwisely advising her readers that cabbages could be deep-frozen) to interviewing smart buyers of decor for \u201cwhat would soon be known as lifestyle features\u201d.</p> <p>The Guardian, then in transition from its Manchester origins to a London-based national, and in want of female readers, recruited her in 1963. She was design correspondent, dispatched to interview <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/feb/12/architecture\" title=\"\">Alvar Aalto</a> in Helsinki or investigate the classic Isokon Long Chair, but she defined her job as \u201cswinging 60s correspondent\u201d, and extended her interviewees to include David Hockney, John Lennon and the feminist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/06/guardianobituaries.gender\" title=\"\">Betty Friedan</a>.</p> <p>The paper promoted her ferocious opinion column in an ad with her picture, captioned \u201cFiona MacCarthy may look like a fashion model but she writes like a sabre-toothed tiger\u201d. She produced so many pieces that she adopted an alternative byline so her name would not appear twice in the same edition.</p> <p>Many of her subjects came from backgrounds she had never previously encountered (her first crush, after all, had been the master of the Eton beagles), working-class heroes such as Mellor. In 1964 she interviewed him in his native habitat, the modernist studio-workshop with bedsit he had designed in Park Lane, Sheffield.</p> <p>The city was then an environment of making \u2013 steelworks and cutlery \u2013 where design was fought for, and over. Mellor and MacCarthy shared compatible aesthetics; she espoused his philosophy of design and democracy, then him. They married in 1966, and he added domestic quarters to the Park Lane premises. She inspired Mellor\u2019s advance into retail in 1969, with a shop off Sloane Square, in Chelsea, selling utensils for the new posh cooking.</p> <p>MacCarthy left the Guardian in 1969, and was briefly women\u2019s editor of the London Evening Standard before migrating to Sheffield, becoming, as her mother had hoped, a lady of the manor, albeit a manor with heavy machinery, when the family moved, in 1973, into the magnificent Broom Hall, converted to office, workshop and home. Their children, Corin and Clare, were pushed in the buggy to local art galleries, where MacCarthy re-evaluated the Pre-Raphaelites.</p> <p>Sheffield connections with metal crafters brought her to biography. She had interviewed Mellor\u2019s friend, the silversmith Robert Welch, in the Cotswold village of Chipping Campden, where the arts and crafts designer CR Ashbee set up a utopian community in 1902. It had quickly failed but she could still feel and identify with its dreams, and Ashbee, gay leader of its rurally relocated East End craftsmen, who later married and had four children, was an irresistible subject.</p> <p>She rated the resulting The Simple Life (1981) lightweight and under-researched, although, as a first attempt at managing frankness about sexuality, it prepared her for the Gill biography. Harling had introduced her to Gill\u2019s typography, and she admired his art and the principles of his commune, but she hesitated not a moment over including his diary entries about affairs with commune women and abuse of his sisters and daughters. MacCarthy innocently intended only to tell the truth, as exactly as she could establish it. She was shaken to tears when rebuked by critics, readers and friends for her refusal to condemn Gill and repudiated by his family for the disclosures.</p> <p>Stanley Spencer\u2019s kin, too, were unhappy about her clear-eyed and tender 1997 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/11/art.art\" title=\"\">account of him</a> and his sexy art, An English Vision. By the time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/nov/16/featuresreviews.guardianreview13\" title=\"\">Byron, Life and Legend</a>, was published in 2002, her carefully documented case for his homosexuality seemed almost mainstream; the book was respected for its years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview33\" title=\"\">deep research</a>, with none of the many scraps of his handwriting left unread.

If I had thought it was depressing by day, by night it was the stuff of nightmares. The youngest woman after me was in her late 60s. The women were so unhappy they used to wail at night. You had to shout if you wanted a nurse; the nurses came intermittently and, when they did, regularly complained that the women were disturbing them.</p> <p>For all the faults in the system I have helped to expose as a journalist, I honestly thought it would have been better to be an older woman in the NHS today than it was 50 years ago. Yet my own experience shows that there is still massive prejudice against older people, including women.</p> <p>I have an auto-immune disease that older people get: <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/temporal-arteritis/\" title=\"\">giant cell arteritis</a> (GCA). It\u2019s at least three times more common in women than men. It\u2019s the most common form of adult vasculitis \u2013 inflammation of blood vessels \u2013 and affects thousands of people. It often starts with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/nov/01/healthandwellbeing.health#maincontent\" title=\"\">terrible headaches</a> and scalp tenderness, and sometimes with disturbance in the eyes. The cause is abnormally large cells that develop in the arteries, most commonly in the temporal arteries on the side of the head. As the inflammation moves up the head, the jaw can become severely stiff. If the inflammation goes higher, it can press on the optic nerve at the back of the eye, causing permanent sight loss or even complete blindness.</p> <p>I have met elderly women who lost their sight through this illness, which is treatable, because the NHS failed them. In the past year, I have learned of two older people who took their own lives after they learned their total blindness could have been prevented with the right treatment. Going blind is terrible. Going blind when it didn\u2019t need to happen is unbearable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have met elderly women who have lost their sight through this illness, which is treatable, because the NHS failed them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The correct treatment is to give a patient with the recognised symptoms an immediate high dose of steroids to bring down the inflammation and protect their eyesight. Blood tests should be taken and the patient referred very quickly on a fast-track system to a rheumatology hospital department, ideally on the same day, but definitely within three days so that diagnosis can be confirmed and treatment started. If a patient has suffered any sight loss, they should be referred the same day to hospital. But this is often not what happens.</p> <p>Regularly GPs fail to diagnose or, if they do, they fail to give a high dose of steroids. That\u2019s what happened to me. When I developed severe symptoms, my GP told me, after looking the condition up on Google, to take a lower dose of steroids and gave me her phone number on a piece of paper to ring her if I started losing my sight. Of course, if I had started going blind, you might wonder how I would have been able to read that piece of paper.</p> <p>Luckily, my sister is a doctor and, as I had a steroid prescription for a related condition, she told me to take a large dose at once. Within less than an hour the inflammation went down. My sight was saved but I was so appalled that I became a trustee of <a href=\"http://www.pmrgca.co.uk/content/home-page\" title=\"\">the charity for the disease</a>. What I have discovered as a result is nothing less than a national scandal but, because it is mainly older women who are affected, it is just accepted.</p> <p>Few places in the UK have a fast-track system to hospital, so even if the GP diagnoses it, people can wait weeks to get to hospital and proper treatment. Where a fast track exists, only a small percentage of sufferers lose their sight. Otherwise, around <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/53/suppl_2/i5/1819986\" title=\"\">20% of people lose some or all of their sight</a>. That is hundreds of people a year losing their sight for no good medical reason. I have talked to one woman, who was a fit woman in her 70s, who went to her GP after going blind suddenly in one eye. He diagnosed GCA, gave her no treatment, and sent her to A&amp;E. They kept her waiting for five hours, despite the GP\u2019s letter with the diagnosis, by which time she had gone completely and irreversibly blind.</p> <p>If hundreds of children were losing their sight for no good medical reason, it would be on the front page of every paper. Somehow, old women losing their sight doesn\u2019t seem to be a scandal. Hey, we\u2019re getting on; we should expect horrible things to happen to us medically. It\u2019s not like most of us are economically active, so who cares? Of course, the extra scandal about all of this is that elderly people who lose sight become a burden on health and care services. A study showed that saving the sight of people with GCA actually saves the health service money.</p> <p>This makes me so angry. We patients are given constant excuses as to why it isn\u2019t happening. But we know we would get the right treatment if we were younger. Fifty years on from when I lay in that ghastly ward watching old women lie untreated until they died, I see the same prejudice and ageism in the health system today.</p> <p>\u2022 Dorothy Byrne is head of news and current affairs at Channel 4 and vice-chair of <a href=\"http://www.pmrgca.co.uk/content/home-page\" title=\"\">PMRGCAuk</a></p>",

You had to shout if you wanted a nurse; the nurses came intermittently and, when they did, regularly complained that the women were disturbing them. For all the faults in the system I have helped to expose as a journalist, I honestly thought it would have been better to be an older woman in the NHS today than it was 50 years ago. Yet my own experience shows that there is still massive prejudice against older people, including women. I have an auto-immune disease that older people get: giant cell arteritis (GCA). It\u2019s at least three times more common in women than men. It\u2019s the most common form of adult vasculitis \u2013 inflammation of blood vessels \u2013 and affects thousands of people. It often starts with terrible headaches and scalp tenderness, and sometimes with disturbance in the eyes. The cause is abnormally large cells that develop in the arteries, most commonly in the temporal arteries on the side of the head. As the inflammation moves up the head, the jaw can become severely stiff. If the inflammation goes higher, it can press on the optic nerve at the back of the eye, causing permanent sight loss or even complete blindness. I have met elderly women who lost their sight through this illness, which is treatable, because the NHS failed them. In the past year, I have learned of two older people who took their own lives after they learned their total blindness could have been prevented with the right treatment. Going blind is terrible. Going blind when it didn\u2019t need to happen is unbearable. The correct treatment is to give a patient with the recognised symptoms an immediate high dose of steroids to bring down the inflammation and protect their eyesight. Blood tests should be taken and the patient referred very quickly on a fast-track system to a rheumatology hospital department, ideally on the same day, but definitely within three days so that diagnosis can be confirmed and treatment started. If a patient has suffered any sight loss, they should be referred the same day to hospital. But this is often not what happens. Regularly GPs fail to diagnose or, if they do, they fail to give a high dose of steroids. That\u2019s what happened to me. When I developed severe symptoms, my GP told me, after looking the condition up on Google, to take a lower dose of steroids and gave me her phone number on a piece of paper to ring her if I started losing my sight. Of course, if I had started going blind, you might wonder how I would have been able to read that piece of paper. Luckily, my sister is a doctor and, as I had a steroid prescription for a related condition, she told me to take a large dose at once. Within less than an hour the inflammation went down. My sight was saved but I was so appalled that I became a trustee of the charity for the disease. What I have discovered as a result is nothing less than a national scandal but, because it is mainly older women who are affected, it is just accepted. Few places in the UK have a fast-track system to hospital, so even if the GP diagnoses it, people can wait weeks to get to hospital and proper treatment. Where a fast track exists, only a small percentage of sufferers lose their sight. Otherwise, around 20% of people lose some or all of their sight. That is hundreds of people a year losing their sight for no good medical reason. I have talked to one woman, who was a fit woman in her 70s, who went to her GP after going blind suddenly in one eye. He diagnosed GCA, gave her no treatment, and sent her to A&amp;E. They kept her waiting for five hours, despite the GP\u2019s letter with the diagnosis, by which time she had gone completely and irreversibly blind. If hundreds of children were losing their sight for no good medical reason, it would be on the front page of every paper. Somehow, old women losing their sight doesn\u2019t seem to be a scandal. Hey, we\u2019re getting on; we should expect horrible things to happen to us medically. It\u2019s not like most of us are economically active, so who cares? Of course, the extra scandal about all of this is that elderly people who lose sight become a burden on health and care services. A study showed that saving the sight of people with GCA actually saves the health service money. This makes me so angry. We patients are given constant excuses as to why it isn\u2019t happening. But we know we would get the right treatment if we were younger. Fifty years on from when I lay in that ghastly ward watching old women lie untreated until they died, I see the same prejudice and ageism in the health system today. \u2022 Dorothy Byrne is head of news and current affairs at Channel 4 and vice-chair of PMRGCAuk",

Some have lost their life savings to fraudsters.</p> <p>Details of the operation have been leaked by a whistleblower who provided the Swedish daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter with secretly filmed footage, internal company documents and testimony about its practices.

      "bodyText": "An army of more more than 200 fake \u201ctraders\u201d based in Ukraine have been persuading victims all over the world to part with their savings, according to a whistleblower from the operation who describes it as a huge investment scam. British and Australian victims of a sophisticated enterprise were apparently lured by fake ads posted on Facebook and mobile phone games featuring celebrities such as Gordon Ramsay, Hugh Jackman and the moneysaving expert Martin Lewis. After responding to the ads, the whistleblower alleges that unsuspecting victims were contacted by call-centre workers operating in a building in the heart of Kyiv\u2019s business district, promising lucrative investment opportunities. But the investments in bitcoin, commodities and foreign currencies all appear to be fake, as do the follow-up calls from companies telling victims that they could help them recover the losses. Investors in the UK and Australia are among thousands of people caught up in the apparent scam, which is allegedly being run from two floors of a respectable office building in the Ukrainian capital. Some have lost their life savings to fraudsters. Details of the operation have been leaked by a whistleblower who provided the Swedish daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter with secretly filmed footage, internal company documents and testimony about its practices. The material has been seen by the Guardian and other partners in the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). According to the whistleblower, the fraudulent investment operation made $70m (\u00a355m) last year. The information he supplied also suggests that: \u2022 Victims of the scam were persuaded to install software on their computers and phones that gave fraudsters access to their bank details. \u2022 Accounts were faked showing huge returns to encourage people to trust the company and invest more. \u2022 Fake traders were disparaging about their victims in internal company postings, repeatedly remarking how they had \u201cfucked\u201d unsuspecting investors. \u2022 Members of the \u201cretention\u201d team at the firm, which was tasked with making 300 calls a day to extract more money from investors, were rewarded by commission-based payments according to how much money they persuaded victims to hand over. The whistleblower said the purpose of the retentions department, which he worked in, was to \u201csqueeze the money\u201d from clients until they were down to \u201cthe last cent\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s money from accounts, it\u2019s money from their wages, even they push the clients to borrow money from the banks.\u201d The whistleblower identified a Ukrainian company called Milton Group as the firm behind the alleged scheme. It has no links to UK companies of the same or similar names. According to leaked documents, it operates a number of front companies including CryptoMB, Cryptobase and Vetoro Banc, which it portrays as a UK bank with its head office in Brighton. Milton Group did not respond to a request for comment. In a telephone call, Milton Group\u2019s CEO, Jacob Keselman, told Dagens Nyheter that the information on the firm was \u201cincorrect\u201d and that it was a software company that provided IT support for other companies. Keselman describes himself as \u201cthe wolf of Kiev\u201d on his Instagram profile, in an apparent nod to the Hollywood film The Wolf of Wall Street, about a penny-stock scam.

After being persuaded by traders to invest, victims said they saw their savings vanish, with losses ranging from $50 to several thousand pounds.

Mitie has declined to comment. A spokesperson for Central North West London NHS Foundation Trust, who provide healthcare at Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre, said: \u201cWe are sorry for Mr Shaw\u2019s distress and share the concern about delays. Healthcare provide help within the IRC and staff have no power to take people out of the IRC (the IRC\u2019s Care and Custody Team make those arrangements). \u201cMr Shaw was seen immediately by healthcare staff after the fall but staff were unsure about the extent of his ankle injury; he was given analgesia, his leg elevated and kept under review. \u201cThe following day he was seen by the GP who recommended an x-ray.The IRC\u2019s care and custody team were unable to take him so he was given more analgesia and a registered nurse kept him under review. The care and custody team took him for an x-ray on Thursday. We have no further update on Mr Shaw\u2019s injury.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Right I think that\u2019s about your lot. I\u2019ll leave you with Andy Hunter\u2019s report \u2013 but stay tuned for more reaction on our site. Thanks for joining me. It was fun. Cheerio! Here\u2019s Carlo Ancelotti: \u201cI spoke with the referee, I\u2019d like to keep that private. It was borderline, Gylfi was offside but we don\u2019t think he interfered with the goalkeeper\u2019s vision. \u201cHe was on the floor, so De Gea\u2019s vision was clear. But, it was offside. Everyone knows the referee\u2019s decision is very difficult.\u201d Ancelotti says he doesn\u2019t know if he will appeal. As it stands, he\u2019ll miss Everton\u2019s trip to his former club, Chelsea. \u201cSigurdsson is almost directly between Calvert-Lewin and De Gea when Calvert-Lewin shoots, and before it deflected off Maguire,\u201d says Graeme Thorn. Entirely true, and that\u2019s the reason it was ruled out. I think the goal being disallowed is fair enough; I don\u2019t know if there would be outrage if it hadn\u2019t been given. My improptu poll below has it 60-40 in favour of giving the goal. Which shows how tough a call it was \u2013 but I\u2019m still surprised VAR felt confident enough to overturn it. Ancelotti is apparently in the referee\u2019s room, discussing the decision. Oh to be a fly on the wall, etc. Here\u2019s Nick Ames\u2019 report from Tottenham, where Wolves flexed their Champions League muscles. Still waiting to see if Ancelotti is going to make an appearance, or whether he\u2019s still lost in a cloud of steam in the home dressing room. Here\u2019s Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r: \u201cFirst half, we were excellent after a very strange start. David was too slow there, he knows that. \u201cSecond half, they threw everything at us. We had that late chance, but we\u2019re pleased with the point. Fantastic save at the end there, [and] he\u2019s said he got distracted by the boy in front of him there.\u201d Here\u2019s Andy Hunter\u2019s first take from Goodison. That last four minutes will have been rough on the press box: In the studio, Souness and Keane say the goal shouldn\u2019t have counted, and don\u2019t miss an opportunity to lambast Sigurdsson for not putting the first chance away. On De Gea\u2019s save, Keane says \u201cthat\u2019s his job\u201d. Souness on Pickford: \u201cHe\u2019s the England goalkeeper!\u201d Keane follows up with: \u201cKeepers train for that every day.\u201d The hardest working man in sports broadcasting, David Jones, eventually forces some praise out of them. Here\u2019s Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who says that goal should have stood: \u201cGylfi moves his legs out the way, the keeper\u2019s never gonna save it ... he\u2019s not in his line of sight\u201d. The official verdict from VAR is that Sigurdsson was in De Gea\u2019s line of sight. Anyway, I\u2019ll throw it over to you, readers: VAR? Huh! What is it good for? Overturning late winners that probably shouldn\u2019t have stood, in this case. That goal was the type that would have been flagged before, an incorrect decision costing United a deserved point \u2013 and it would have been particularly harsh on Maguire, who was otherwise brilliant. I\u2019m still a bit confused as to how interfering with play \u2013 an extremely subjective call \u2013 was so quickly overturned. FT: Tottenham 2-3 Wolves What a result for Wolves, who fought back from 1-0 and 2-1 down to leapfrog Spurs and go sixth. Ancelotti is livid, and remonstrates at length with Chris Kavanagh, who shows him a red card! That\u2019ll be a touchline ban for Carlo. One more Everton corner after that drama, but Richarlison heads over. And with that, the boos ring out around Goodison. The replays show that Sigurdsson didn\u2019t touch the ball, but lifted his legs to let it roll in. He\u2019s a mile offside, and interfering with play \u2013 even if I\u2019m not sure a wrong-footed De Gea would have stopped it anyway. Have Everton just won it?! What utter, utter scenes. Richarlison finds himself in space, and lays the ball back to Sigurdsson, four yards out ... but now De Gea turns it away with his boot! Narrative. But it\u2019s turned back in by Calvert-Lewin, hits Maguire\u2019s heel, trickles past Sigurdsson on the deck \u2013 and in! The place erupts, but this is going to a VAR check, post-haste ... 90 mins: Pickford saves Everton! United come again, and Mata plays in Fernandes. He gets a looping shot away under pressure and Pickford gets a glove to it. It\u2019s dropping right into Ighalo\u2019s path though \u2013 but somehow, Pickford springs across goal and gets a boot to it! 89 mins: At the other end, Sigurdsson gives away a cheap corner, but Mata\u2019s low effort is risible, and Sidibe clears. 88 mins: Sidibe\u2019s tired-looking cross is cleared by Maguire. From Everton\u2019s 800th corner of the second half ... Maguire heads clear. 87 mins: Richarlison shimmies past Wan Bissaka and Fred down the left, but his cut back is turned behind by Lindel\u00f6f. The Swede also meets the corner, but the whistle goes for a push, by Davies on De Gea. 85 mins: Everton corner, and you guess which slab-shaped head gets to the ball first. Fernandes may get man of the match but Maguire has been fantastic. Two contrasting performances, in fairness. 83 mins: Another promising Everton free kick as Fred fouls Davies close to the byline. Maguire heads it clear again! 82 mins: Moise Kean is on for the final stages, replacing Andre Gomes, who has come through an 80-minute workout unscathed. Carlo\u2019s going for the win! 81 mins: Sidibe has been booked for coming back on without the referee\u2019s permission. He can\u2019t quite get the hang of the whole \u201cgetting on the field\u201d thing, can he? 80 mins: Fernandes finds space on the edge of the area, but his low shot lacks power and Pickford gathers. 79 mins: Carragher said Baines was lucky not to have scored an own goal there which seemed a) harsh and b) a bit rich, coming from him. Team news is in from Wembley, where Phil Foden starts for City. Kevin De Bruyne is on the bench. Join Simon Burnton here: 77 mins: United break at speed, Fernandes absolutely roasting Gomes for pace, then firing a low cross towards Ighalo \u2013 but Baines gets back to cut it out! Superb work, stopping what looked a certain goal. 76 mins: Another Everton corner, this time taken by Baines from De Gea\u2019s left \u2013 and it\u2019s the best delivery so far, dipping right in front of goal, where Maguire thrusts a knee at it to clear. Tottenham 2-3 Wolves: Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez has put Wolves ahead! As it stands, they\u2019ll be going level on points with United ... 72 mins: Two changes for United; Odion Ighalo and Juan Mata are on, Greenwood and McTominay off. 71 mins: Sigurdsson\u2019s free kick is slammed into the United wall. Perhaps it\u2019s for the best: Fred didn\u2019t handle the ball, so we\u2019d all have to talk about VAR again. 70 mins: Maguire wins a couple of big headers to clear the danger, but Everton get a free kick right in the Sigurdsson zone from a Fred handball. He\u2019s booked, then gives the referee a nudge, and Maguire has to make another timely intervention, dragging the midfielder away. 69 mins: Calvert-Lewin canters onto a Davies through-ball, but is shepherded wide by Maguire. He gets a low shot away, which De Gea saves with his feet. 68 mins: Halfway through the second half, and this game is very much up for grabs. 66 mins: A couple of corners from Sigurdsson, but he can\u2019t find that killer delivery. 64 mins: So much of Everton\u2019s attacking play has involved the two strikers making a nuisance of themselves on the edge of the box. Here, Richarlison turns smartly but his shot is charged down by Maguire ... 63 mins: Another Everton corner, as Matic continues an efficient afternoon by cutting out Baines\u2019 cross. It\u2019s cleared but the hosts come again, until Gomes\u2019 aimless through ball rolls behind. 62 mins: Walcott, who\u2019s been largely peripheral, is replaced by Bernard. 61 mins: Fernandes plays the corner short, takes it back, dances past two defenders and has a shot hurriedly closed down by Tom Davies. This guy is absolute box office. 60 mins: More magic from Fernandes, a clever dummy playing in Greenwood, who finds Martial to his left. His shot is closed down, deflecting behind for a corner. 59 mins: Lindelof gets the better of Calvert-Lewin this time, holding the striker off smartly. Tottenham 2-2 Wolves: Diogo Jota has got Wolves level again against Spurs, turning in Doherty\u2019s cross. 56 mins: Everton hit the post! It\u2019s Sigurdsson who takes it, from a fair way out wide \u2013 but he goes for goal, and curls a terrific effort onto the near post! De Gea wasn\u2019t getting there \u2013 I reckon an inch to the right, and that\u2019s pinging in. 55 mins: Calvert-Lewin gets some change from the United defence, a quick switch of direction outfoxing Lindelof, who brings him down. Dangerous free kick ... 53 mins: It\u2019s been a bit of a slow, scrappy start to the second half. 51 mins: Fernandes tries to set Martial free down the left with the outside of his boot, but Sidibe gets back to clear, and the corner is dealt with. 50 mins: United look to break from an Everton corner, but Fred\u2019s pass is mishit and the hosts scurry back. Gomes draws a foul to give them some breathing space. As many, many people are pointing out on Twitter, it\u2019s been a very good afternoon for Manchester United and England\u2019s Dean Henderson so far. 47 mins: Scott McTominay wins a foul after muscling past Gylfi Sigurdsson. Bruno Fernandes lifts it towards Harry Maguire but he\u2019s in \u201cdouble coverage\u201d, to borrow an NFL expression. We\u2019re back under way. We\u2019ve had goalkeeping errors, big-money signings impressing, and a few dodgy tackles. A solid 8 on the Barclays-o-meter so far. \u201cWith Bruno in the team, all the United players seem more confident in possession and in their movements off the ball. Plus he\u2019s absolute mustard isn\u2019t he?\u201d writes Duncan Edwards, who was always going to a United fan. Half-time reading: Tottenham 2-1 Wolves: It won\u2019t be level at the break in the other top-flight game. Serge Aurier\u2019s stunner has put Spurs back in front! After a nightmare start, United were much the better side, and were good value for their equaliser \u2013 even if it came after more iffy goalkeeping. Things then turned scrappy and spiky, with both teams in need of the break to clear their heads. 46 mins: Oof! This is Everton\u2019s best chance since the first five minutes. Baines whips in a tempting outswinger from near the corner flag and Richarlison flings himself at it \u2013 but just can\u2019t connect with the header! 44 mins: Maguire goes in the book for a foul on Calvert-Lewin. Four yellow cards in the last five minutes. \u201cThat was a lovely goal by Bruno. He has single-handedly saved Ole\u2019s job,\u201d says Mary Waltz. I don\u2019t know about single-handed \u2013 players like Fred have improved immensely, too \u2013 but he\u2019s been quite the January signing. 42 mins: Davies does go in the book now, for a ragged tackle on Matic. He got a let-off, and he wasted it. 40 mins: Things are getting a bit spicy all of a sudden, with Calvert-Lewin upending Shaw, and Tom Davies then getting involved. It\u2019s all threatening to boil over, with Ancelotti and Duncan Ferguson (!) trying to drag Davies away. Calvert-Lewin is booked, and Shaw gets a yellow for his reaction. 39 mins: Everton fans are unhappy as United fail to return possession from the throw-in. Richarlison is still on but moving awkwardly \u2013 and now takes another knock from Maguire ... 37 mins: It\u2019s the second time Richarlison has spent time on the deck in this half, and he\u2019s looking fragile. He goes down again soon after play restarts, and may have to come off ... Tottenham 1-1 Wolves: A leveller at Spurs too, as Matt Doherty gets Wolves on terms. 35 mins: Richarlison is down after a stray boot from Fred catches him on the knee. Fernandes collected Matic\u2019s short pass in midfield, was given time and space 20 yards out, and fired a low, swerving shot towards the near post. It was certainly moving, but Pickford will be disappointed. He gets down to it, but the ball zips under his arm and in! Bruno Fernandes strikes again, and United are deservedly level! 30 mins: United win a corner, which Fernandes whips in. Holgate\u2019s looping header has Pickford back tracking, before Maguire is penalised for a foul ... 28 mins: Gareth Southgate is here, principally to keep tabs on Jordan Pickford. Surely Calvert-Lewin has earned a shot with England, particularly given their injuries up front? 27 mins: Seamus Coleman is going off, having taken a knock to his ankle. Djibril Sidibe has his socks on, and comes on to replace him at right-back. 25 mins: Calvert-Lewin finds Richarlison on the edge of the area, and he controls well before sending it left to Sigurdsson. It\u2019s a touch overhit though, and the move fizzles out. 24 mins: Free kick wide left for Everton, with Baines and Sigurdsson over it. It\u2019s the latter who whips it in, and it drops into an awkward area for United, but it\u2019s scrambled clear before Calvert-Lewin can react. 22 mins: Fernandes with a cheeky nutmeg for the YouTube compilation, then a low cross that only troubles the side netting. 20 mins: More attacking intent from United, Fernandes linking things up nicely before Shaw\u2019s curious cross-shot goes nowhere. 62% possession so far. \u201cAs a Everton fan I will take the goal as credit even though it was due to De Gea\u2019s brain cramp,\u201d says Mary Waltz. Hey, they all count. 18 mins: Gomes gets the better of compatriot Bruno Fernandes, shrugging him off and proceeding into the box, where his shot is blocked. An Everton fan screams \u201csecond ball!!\u201d loud enough for everyone in the ground to hear. 17 mins: Fred is making useful inroads on the left of that diamond; his cross is perfect for Mason Greenwood, who should probably have done better with a free header from 10 yards, which he puts over the bar. Tottenham 1-0 Wolves: Over in North London, Steven Bergwijn has fired Spurs ahead, following up after Dele Alli\u2019s effort was saved. 14 mins: Everton haven\u2019t been able to build on that early gift; they\u2019re sitting deep and struggling to build attacks just now. 12 mins: United fans appeal for a penalty as Fred\u2019s powerful shot is charged down by Richarlison, standing about six inches away. It struck his arm, but thankfully we\u2019re not seeing those given these days. 11 mins: Although to be fair, they\u2019ve responded really well \u2013 and Matic tests Pickford with another rocket from the edge of the box. He gets down well to turn it away. Well, quite. There was absolutely zero danger when De Gea got the ball; they\u2019ve basically given Everton a goal start ... 9 mins: Shaw gets upfield and picks out Martial with a pass to feet. The striker turns, but scuffs his shot well wide. 6 mins: United hit the bar! This game is being played at a fair old whip, with United getting forward at pace. Fred cuts in from the left and cuts back to Matic, whose effort from 20 yards crashes off the crossbar! 5 mins: Calvert-Lewin almost adds a second! A long ball upfield puts him in behind, but De Gea begins making up for that error with a fine, low save to his left. What was that about making a good start? United play the ball around at the back, and De Gea lines up a hoof downfield \u2013 but he takes too long, Calvert-Lewin closes him down \u2013 and the ricochet flies into the net! OH. MY. WORD. What a mistake from David de Gea! 1 min: Everton charge forward and Richarlison is felled by a firm, but fair challenge from Lindel\u00f6f. He stays down for a moment or two, but is OK to carry on. Here we go! The teams are in the tunnel, the sirens from \u201cZ-Cars\u201d warming things up outside. This could be a cracker; let\u2019s hope for some more thrikers like these: Souness and Keane, football\u2019s own Statler and Waldorf, are at it again while talking about Andr\u00e9 Gomes: \u201ctakes too long on the ball\u201d; \u201cunbelievably slow\u201d. \u201cI like him,\u201d Souey adds, somewhat unconvincingly. Solskj\u00e6r has had a quick pre-match chat with MUTV. He says Dan James is out as a \u201cprecaution\u201d but should be back next week. \u201cThis is a tough place to play, if you don\u2019t get off to a good start,\u201d he adds. There\u2019s another 2pm kick-off in the Premier League today, with Spurs facing Wolves. Defeat for United here would allow the winner of that game to jump into fifth. Here\u2019s a bit of team news, and I\u2019ll do my best to keep you abreast of any goals there. Tottenham: Gazzaniga; Aurier, Sanchez, Tanganga, Davies; Dier, Winks; Bergwijn, Alli, Lo Celso; Lucas Moura. Subs: Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Vorm, Ndombele, Skipp, Fernandes, Parrott. Wolves: Rui Patricio; Boly, Coady, Saiss; Doherty, Neves, Joao Moutinho, Ruben Vinagre; Traore, Jimenez, Jota. Subs: Pedro Neto, Daniel Podence, Gibbs-White, Ruddy, Dendoncker, Kilman, Rasmussen. It\u2019s a Manchester United game, televised by Sky, so time for Graeme Souness to have a pop at Paul Pogba. \u201cThe cynic in me wonders if he\u2019ll be back playing again when the Euros come around. We\u2019ve seen him dancing at a wedding, shooting hoops ...\u201d Roy Keane is slightly more measured, instead suggesting United are no longer missing Pogba\u2019s presence on the field. It would be fun to see him linking up with Fernandes though, surely. Only four of United\u2019s starting XI started that 4-0 defeat at Goodison: David de Gea, Victor Lindel\u00f6f, Nemanja Matic and Fred. There are six Everton players in today\u2019s line-up that started back in April: Pickford, Coleman, Keane, Sigurdsson, Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin. So, Andre Gomes makes his first start since that awful ankle injury he suffered against Spurs. Carlo Ancelotti is ringing the changes from the 3-2 defeat at Arsenal, with Michael Keane, S\u00e9amus Coleman, Theo Walcott and Tom Davies also coming in. For United, Anthony Martial is ruled fit enough to start the game, in what looks like a possible diamond formation, with Bruno Fernandes tucked in behind Martial and Mason Greenwood. Interesting ... Everton: Pickford; Coleman, Keane, Holgate, Baines; Walcott, Gomes, Davies, Sigurdsson; Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison. Subs: Delph, Mina, Iwobi, Sidibe, Bernard, Kean, Virginia. Manchester United: De Gea; Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw; Matic, McTominay, Fred, Bruno Fernandes; Greenwood, Martial. Subs: Bailly, Mata, Lingard, Pereira, Romero, Ighalo, Williams. Referee: Chris Kavanagh (Lancashire) Goodison Park used to hold happy memories for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. As a Manchester United player, he won five matches here, scoring a couple of goals to boot. Just look at this slice of vintage Barclays from 1997. Lovely stuff. That all changed last April when United got thrashed 4-0 here, a rare highlight in Marco Silva\u2019s deeply underwhelming tenure. \u201cThat performance is difficult to describe because it was so bad,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said afterwards. Our own Andy Hunter came up with a few suggestions: shambles, humiliation, pathetic, spineless. It\u2019s been a long road back, but United now finally appear to have upward momentum. They\u2019re unbeaten in seven since losing to Burnley last month, and have signed a potential superstar in Bruno Fernandes. Win today, and they\u2019ll be a point behind Chelsea. The trouble is, Everton have got better too. Under Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s steady hand, they are rebuilding the identity that became so muddled under Ronald Koeman, Sam Allardyce and Silva. A home win would put Everton two points behind United, a raised eyebrow firmly in Ole\u2019s rear-view mirror. Kick-off is at 2pm (GMT). Team news and buildup to come.",

He was assigned a lawyer who was allowed a one-hour session with my father in-person prior to the trial. My father was given one hour to consult with his lawyer after being subject to investigation for 11 months.</p> <p>\u201cNeither the media nor family members were allowed access to the courtroom. The trial was wrapped in four hours, in what was a wholesale, predetermined verdict. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.\u201d</p> <p>He said his father\u2019s physical and mental health had deteriorated dramatically over 13 months in prison, and he had been isolated from his family. Dennis Chau said he feared his father could not survive his prison sentence.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s held in a cell for 23 hours of the day with one hour of exercise permitted. We\u2019ve made requests for family visitation, none of which have been granted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy father turned 70 last year, and so with a 12-year sentence, he\u2019ll be 82 when he is released.

      "bodyText": "The trial of a retired Australian baker sentenced to 12 years in jail in Vietnam on terrorism charges was a \u201ccharade\u201d, his son says, saying he fears his father will die in jail as he faces his final appeal on Monday. Political prisoner Chau Van Kham, 70, was arrested in Vietnam in January 2019, accused of meeting with fellow members of Viet Tan, a pro-democracy advocacy group proscribed by Vietnam\u2019s communist government, and of helping finance the organisation. Chau\u2019s single-day judge-only trial, held simultaneously with four other people, saw him tried and convicted on charges of \u201cfinancing terrorism\u201d, and sentenced to 12 years in jail, all within four hours. The court was effectively closed \u2013 open only for approved people, his family was excluded \u2013 for the entirety of the trial. Speaking at the United Nations\u2019 Geneva summit for human rights and democracy in February, Chau\u2019s son, Dennis, described his father\u2019s 12-year sentence as \u201ceffectively a death sentence\u201d. \u201cThe entire charade was rushed and improper. He was assigned a lawyer who was allowed a one-hour session with my father in-person prior to the trial. My father was given one hour to consult with his lawyer after being subject to investigation for 11 months. \u201cNeither the media nor family members were allowed access to the courtroom. The trial was wrapped in four hours, in what was a wholesale, predetermined verdict. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.\u201d He said his father\u2019s physical and mental health had deteriorated dramatically over 13 months in prison, and he had been isolated from his family. Dennis Chau said he feared his father could not survive his prison sentence. \u201cHe\u2019s held in a cell for 23 hours of the day with one hour of exercise permitted. We\u2019ve made requests for family visitation, none of which have been granted.\u201d \u201cMy father turned 70 last year, and so with a 12-year sentence, he\u2019ll be 82 when he is released. Factoring in prison conditions and poor access to medical treatments, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll ever see him alive, a free man. It\u2019s effectively a death sentence.\u201d Chau\u2019s appeal against his conviction and sentence will be heard early Monday morning in Ho Chi Minh City. In response to his appeal, the prosecution have added to their indictment a request he be deported from Vietnam after he serves his sentence. Sources close to Chau say they have little faith in the appeals process, and little hope for a quashing or reduction in his sentence. A US citizen, Michael Nguyen, convicted on identical charges, and also sentenced to 12 years in jail, had his sentence confirmed in a recent appeal. Chau\u2019s family and supporters say the Australian government needs to more aggressively pressure the Vietnamese government over what they argue is clearly a political prosecution. He has been allowed one meeting with his lawyer ahead of his appeal. Previously, Chau had been granted one consular visit a month \u2013 always observed by Vietnamese security officials \u2013 but Australian consular officials were denied a meeting in February, with authorities citing concerns over coronavirus for cancelling all consular visits for prisoners. Chau, an Australian citizen, was born in Vietnam and served in the army of the Republic of Vietnam before 1975. After the war, he was sent to a re-education camp for three years, before he fled Vietnam by boat, arriving in Australia in 1983. In Sydney, he worked as a baker for decades, rising before dawn to work at a modest suburban bakery. In 2010, he became a member of the Viet Tan pro-democracy organisation, and became a key Australian organiser of pro-reform rallies and an outspoken advocate for democratisation in Vietnam. In the 1980s, Viet Tan had advocated for the toppling of the communist government through popular uprising, but in recent years it has explicitly \u201crejected the use of violence\u201d, stating the organisation is \u201cconvinced that nonviolent means are most effective for generating maximum civic participation \u2026 to contribute to Vietnam\u2019s modernisation and reform\u201d. The United Nations describes Viet Tan as \u201ca peaceful organisation advocating for democratic reform\u201d, but it was formally proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the Vietnamese government in 2016, which said it was \u201ca reactionary and terrorist organisation, always silently carrying out activities against Vietnam\u201d. Chau sought to return to Vietnam in 2019 to meet fellow pro-democracy advocates but was refused a visa by the Vietnamese government. He chose to cross into Vietnam via a land border with Cambodia in January, carrying false identity documents. He was later arrested after meeting with a democracy activist who, it is believed, was under surveillance, along with Vietnamese nationals Nguyen Van Vien and Tran Van Quyen, who were sentenced to 11 and 10 years in prison respectively. Chau was initially charged with participating in activities aimed at overthrowing the government, but in July this was downgraded to \u201cterrorism to oppose the people\u2019s government\u201d. Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Public Security said in a statement Chau was convicted of holding a senior position in the New South Wales chapter of Viet Tan, for \u201cfinancing terrorism\u201d and for recruiting new members to the movement. Dennis Chau said his father was a peaceful man, committed to campaigning for a more democratic Vietnam. \u201cMy father came to Australia with nothing but the clothes on his back as a refugee after the Vietnam war. He worked hard all his life to make something for him and his family in his new adopted home. He grew to be a proud Australian, proud of the freedoms we take for granted. \u201cI feel as though when my father left the land he loved, he left something behind \u2026 he felt for the people of Vietnam \u2026 he felt compelled to advocate and affect change. He\u2019d never abandon his sense of duty to call for a more open, free society in Vietnam.\u201d Dennis Chau said he hoped the international community would continue to raise his father\u2019s case as a matter of concern with the Vietnamese government. And he said the Australian government must do more to pressure Vietnam, a significant trading partner. \u201cThe Australian government must be held to a higher standard, as a western democracy, to not put trade relations above basic human rights \u2013 the ones that we hold so dear. \u201cIt is silence that breeds inaction. It is silence that lets these governments know that it is OK to continue with their ways.\u201d",

At the international level, Australia was falling behind its rivals \u2013 Australian men\u2019s teams were not qualifying for major tournaments at youth level, and young players were not getting the minutes they needed.</p> <p>For Football Federation Australia there was a desperate need to incentivise clubs to invest in the nation\u2019s youth; but from the clubs\u2019 perspective protections first needed to be in place. And so, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/02/football-federation-australia-governance-stoush-resolved-after-two-year-struggle\">with the two-year power struggle over the leadership of the game resolved</a>, behind the scenes key parties started important conversations.</p> <p>Crucially, as the chief executive of Professional Footballers Australia, John Didulica, told Guardian Australia, the \u201ctripartite discussions\u201d proceeded without rancour. \u201cIt was a really good discussion, we all landed in the right place - there was no, what you\u2019d consider to be orthodox \u2018negotiation\u2019 \u2013 the parties sat side-by-side in signing off on it.\u201d</p> <p>The outcome of these particular discussions was a series of regulatory reforms signed off ahead of the 2019/20 A-League season. The first, a rule <a href=\"https://www.a-league.com.au/news/hyundai-a-league-clubs-able-add-additional-u-23-players-substitute-bench-upcoming-season\">extending bench sizes for local under-23 players</a>, the second, <a href=\"https://www.a-league.com.au/salary-cap-system\">adjustments to the salary cap</a> allowing up to nine under-20 players on scholarship deals as well as up to four under-23 academy graduates as \u201chomegrown players\u201d \u2013 all on contracts counted outside the cap. For clubs in a closed system battling both salary and squad-size restrictions the competitive advantages of investing in youth became significant.</p> <p>Across the league, the success of the rule changes is already in the numbers \u2013 35 scholarship players and 23 homegrown players contributed to a record number of young Australian (and New Zealand) talent signing professional contracts this season \u2013 the A-League now boasts 89 players under-21.</p> <p>For PFA, bridging the abyss between the semi-professional and professional level has been a huge success of the expanded scholarship provisions.</p> <p>\u201cA big deficiency historically has been that when young players leave the A-League, the other young players behind them haven\u2019t been ready to step up,\u201d said Didulica.</p> <p>\u201cThe gap between the young kids who are basically part-timers earning $60 a week, trying to juggle football and other demands, that gap was way too great. Now, with the scholarship players being able to train alongside pros you\u2019ll see those players over time be able to be integrated into first-team squads a lot more effectively.\u201d</p> <p>Tilio and Van der Saag were two such scholarship recipients \u2013 and without the regulatory changes the story above may never have unfolded.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9225b23d5f1959da9fda5df1b4dd8cdc131dfdd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9225b23d5f1959da9fda5df1b4dd8cdc131dfdd9/0_78_3312_2358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Van der Saag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Van der Saag has risen through the ranks at Sydney FC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Pateman/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The elixir of youth \u2013 marketing the A-League</strong></p> <p>Another fairytale from the 2019-20 A-League season has been Adelaide United\u2019s Mohamed Toure.

But having earned his break during round 18, the following week the 15-year-old became the competition\u2019s youngest ever goalscorer \u2013 another headline-grabbing story \u2013 after an action-packed 13-minute cameo.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/01/2020-vision-needed-for-australian-football-as-james-johnson-era-begins\">2020 vision needed for Australian football as James Johnson era begins | Richard Parkin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For FFA\u2019s head of leagues, Greg O\u2019Rourke, such headlines and resulting global attention have untold commercial value for the competition as a whole.

A pathway \u2013 reaching forward potentially seven years. It\u2019s a far cry from the days when an emerging player like Isaka Cernak might bounce back and forth along the periphery of the professional game, collecting six different A-League clubs between the age of 18-25.</p> <p>For Adelaide fans there\u2019s the added bonus of knowing that this kid \u2013 a talent their club developed \u2013 remains theirs.

      "bodyText": "It was a football fairytale. A local kid rising through the ranks at his hometown club, scoring a first senior goal 75 seconds into his debut. As his team flagged badly, Sydney FC\u2019s Steve Corica knew they needed a spark. In the 88th minute he turned to Marco Tilio. Seven touches into his professional career the 18-year-old found the net, controlling a cross from Harry Van der Saag before firing past Mark Birighitti. His Sydney FC teammates mobbed him \u2013 not just the young ones, senior figures like Alex Wilkinson \u2013 exhausted after playing nearly 90 minutes in energy-sapping conditions and the exertions of an arduous return journey to Japan midweek \u2013 sprinted 50 metres to congratulate the academy graduate. Milos Ninkovic got in Tilio\u2019s ear at the restart. His head was spinning, his heart beating out of his chest, but calming words from a seasoned pro helped him quickly refocus. Less than 90 seconds later the teen turned provider \u2013 this time it was fellow homegrown hope Van der Saag who lashed home a third goal to secure the points. The stuff of fables, but one that would never have been written had Australian football\u2019s warring factions not learned to cooperate. The Youth Development Conundrum The A-League clubs had a problem. Some, like Western Sydney Wanderers, Melbourne City or Sydney FC, had invested millions into their youth facilities. But how to prevent rival clubs poaching players they had poured untold time, money and energy into developing? The players\u2019 union had a problem. At the end of the past two A-League seasons nearly two-thirds of players came off contract \u2013 the vast majority of whom were younger players, struggling to make the leap from academy to first team. The governing body had a problem. At the international level, Australia was falling behind its rivals \u2013 Australian men\u2019s teams were not qualifying for major tournaments at youth level, and young players were not getting the minutes they needed. For Football Federation Australia there was a desperate need to incentivise clubs to invest in the nation\u2019s youth; but from the clubs\u2019 perspective protections first needed to be in place. And so, with the two-year power struggle over the leadership of the game resolved, behind the scenes key parties started important conversations. Crucially, as the chief executive of Professional Footballers Australia, John Didulica, told Guardian Australia, the \u201ctripartite discussions\u201d proceeded without rancour. \u201cIt was a really good discussion, we all landed in the right place - there was no, what you\u2019d consider to be orthodox \u2018negotiation\u2019 \u2013 the parties sat side-by-side in signing off on it.\u201d The outcome of these particular discussions was a series of regulatory reforms signed off ahead of the 2019/20 A-League season. The first, a rule extending bench sizes for local under-23 players, the second, adjustments to the salary cap allowing up to nine under-20 players on scholarship deals as well as up to four under-23 academy graduates as \u201chomegrown players\u201d \u2013 all on contracts counted outside the cap. For clubs in a closed system battling both salary and squad-size restrictions the competitive advantages of investing in youth became significant. Across the league, the success of the rule changes is already in the numbers \u2013 35 scholarship players and 23 homegrown players contributed to a record number of young Australian (and New Zealand) talent signing professional contracts this season \u2013 the A-League now boasts 89 players under-21. For PFA, bridging the abyss between the semi-professional and professional level has been a huge success of the expanded scholarship provisions. \u201cA big deficiency historically has been that when young players leave the A-League, the other young players behind them haven\u2019t been ready to step up,\u201d said Didulica. \u201cThe gap between the young kids who are basically part-timers earning $60 a week, trying to juggle football and other demands, that gap was way too great. Now, with the scholarship players being able to train alongside pros you\u2019ll see those players over time be able to be integrated into first-team squads a lot more effectively.\u201d Tilio and Van der Saag were two such scholarship recipients \u2013 and without the regulatory changes the story above may never have unfolded. The elixir of youth \u2013 marketing the A-League Another fairytale from the 2019-20 A-League season has been Adelaide United\u2019s Mohamed Toure. Like his brother Al Hassan, whose heroics lit up the FFA Cup final, the younger Toure might never have enjoyed an A-League debut but for a run of injuries. But having earned his break during round 18, the following week the 15-year-old became the competition\u2019s youngest ever goalscorer \u2013 another headline-grabbing story \u2013 after an action-packed 13-minute cameo.

The international dimension \u2013 competing in the global marketplace The revenue challenges facing the A-League have been well-documented. A lucrative broadcast deal is approaching its end amid a disrupted media landscape, and major sponsors \u2013 including the naming rights partner Hyundai \u2013 are reportedly considering their options. Within this context, new FFA chief executive James Johnson has identified a key area for future revenues. \u201cIf you look at the international transfer market, which is upwards of $10bn [Australia is] generating less than $2m of that\u201d, he told Fox Sports. It\u2019s an area in which A-League clubs have regressed badly since the days when Central Coast Mariners nurtured players like Mat Ryan, Trent Sainsbury and Mustafa Amini before recouping significant sums for their young stars. Relative to Asian rivals \u2013 where clubs in the K-League can boast a revenue flow of $50m-plus through player transfer sales over the past five years \u2013 it\u2019s an area that O\u2019Rourke concedes A-League clubs are losing ground. \u201cMore sales will fuel the entire financial ecosystem, and that\u2019s somewhere where we\u2019ve fallen behind.\u201d Rather than putting more rules in place \u2013 such as the K-League\u2019s imposition of one mandatory under-22 player in the starting XI and on the bench before clubs can make three substitutes \u2013 the issue from FFA\u2019s perspective is one of education and incentives and, at the end of the day, basic competitive instinct. \u201cThe primary driver is the owners\u2019 peripheral vision to their peers.

That some clubs are slow to embrace the incentives could be, as Didiluca suggests, an issue of \u201cregulatory lag\u201d \u2013 with the full effect of the changes better judged ahead of the next A-League season. But if Australian clubs are to look to player sales as a means of attracting significant new revenue sources in the future, as indeed Melbourne City have built their business model upon, they have to keep a firm eye on what\u2019s happening overseas, and not just what\u2019s happening around Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s not about whether our young players are getting better year on year,\u201d said Didiluca, \u201cit\u2019s about whether we\u2019re getting better relative to the rest of the world.

The missing \u2018lilypad\u2019 \u2013 an extended Y-League Regulatory adjustments in and of themselves do not create instant successes. In the case of a player like Tilio there are years of effort and sacrifice away from the spotlight to consider \u2013 from the player, from their families, and from numerous backroom staff within club environments. For Sydney FC\u2019s assistant coach, Rob Stanton, it\u2019s a journey that started several years ago. \u201cTechnically, Marco is tremendously talented \u2013 we\u2019ve known that for years inside the Sydney environment,\u201d Stanton told Guardian Australia. \u201cBut it\u2019s taken him a few years to adjust physically \u2013 to make that leap from academy to first team\u201d.

He was sacked as chief executive of Ten by the board \u2013 then chaired by Lachlan Murdoch \u2013 in 2013.</p> <p>That means he can\u2019t be blamed for Ten\u2019s subsequent collapse, in 2017, after two key shareholders, Murdoch and Bermuda-based billionaire Bruce Gordon, refused to continue their guarantee of a $200m loan.</p> <h2>The Prime deal \u2013 and Antony Catalano</h2> <p>The Prime deal was an obvious play for Warburton because just before becoming CEO of Seven, he was <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/warburton-cvc-limited-eye-prime-media-20190624-p520ls\">reportedly</a> leading a private equity-backed consortium that mulled taking over Prime.</p> <p>Sources say the Seven board was initially attracted to Warburton as a contrast to the previous CEO, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/aug/16/tim-worner-resigns-as-seven-west-media-ceo\">Tim Worner</a>, who had been wounded by a scandal over his affair with a staffer.</p> <p>\u201cAll of a sudden you\u2019ve got what a board wants to hear \u2013 someone who unlike Tim has creative ways to build momentum,\u201d an industry source said.</p> <p>However, there is no doubt that under Warburton Seven invested heavily in the Prime deal \u2013 the company estimated it would spend $2.8m just to pull it off, in an industry where every penny counts.</p> <p>The rewards would also have been great, with $11m in cost savings a year to be made by combining the company\u2019s operations.</p> <p>Seven would also have been bolstered by Prime\u2019s financial strength \u2013 unlike its big city cousin, the regional broadcaster\u2019s balance sheet is all but free from debt.</p> <p>The deal was endorsed by Prime\u2019s board, headed at the time by former News Corp executive John Hartigan.</p> <p>But in December it fell apart after opposition from two key shareholders \u2013 Gordon, who controlled 11% of the stock, and a company called WA Chess, controlled by mini-mogul Antony Catalano and billionaire Alex Waislitz.</p> <p>Catalano, a former journalist from Melbourne, made his name \u2013 and fortune \u2013 by building a rival group of glossy local newspapers after leaving Fairfax.

      "bodyText": "When he arrived in August last year, new Seven West Media boss James Warburton promised to enlarge the ailing media company by hunting down and buying businesses. But now, just six months later, the veteran media executive is dealing with the fallout from the failure of his first takeover bid, an effort to take control of regional affiliate Prime that would have transformed Seven\u2019s dismal finances. After being stymied in their bid for Prime, Warburton and Seven\u2019s biggest shareholder, West Australian billionaire Kerry Stokes, would be painfully aware that time is ticking to repay or refinance the $683m it owes to a syndicate of banks. The first instalment is due in November next year, and if it cannot satisfy its lenders, Seven could go the way of fellow broadcaster Ten and fall into administration. Warburton\u2019s freedom to move is also constricted by his pledge to rip $100m in costs out of Seven, a move taken with at least one eye on the need for the company to stay within strict financial constraints set by its banks as a condition of their loans. This, along with the ratings failure of this year\u2019s season of My Kitchen Rules and the possibility that this year\u2019s Olympics could be cancelled due to the coronavirus crisis, will make it harder for him to achieve his other ambition, restoring Seven to its place as the TV network with the most viewers. All this is taking place in a commercial TV industry that is in a grim situation, as demonstrated by financial results released by Seven and its long-time rival Nine over the past fortnight, and a broader media landscape that isn\u2019t much better. Seven declared a loss for the half-year to the end of December of $67.4m, a dramatic fall from the $117m booked for the same period in the previous year, after writing down the value of its broadcasting licence. Warburton has been through the commercial TV mill before. He was sacked as chief executive of Ten by the board \u2013 then chaired by Lachlan Murdoch \u2013 in 2013. That means he can\u2019t be blamed for Ten\u2019s subsequent collapse, in 2017, after two key shareholders, Murdoch and Bermuda-based billionaire Bruce Gordon, refused to continue their guarantee of a $200m loan. The Prime deal \u2013 and Antony Catalano The Prime deal was an obvious play for Warburton because just before becoming CEO of Seven, he was reportedly leading a private equity-backed consortium that mulled taking over Prime. Sources say the Seven board was initially attracted to Warburton as a contrast to the previous CEO, Tim Worner, who had been wounded by a scandal over his affair with a staffer. \u201cAll of a sudden you\u2019ve got what a board wants to hear \u2013 someone who unlike Tim has creative ways to build momentum,\u201d an industry source said. However, there is no doubt that under Warburton Seven invested heavily in the Prime deal \u2013 the company estimated it would spend $2.8m just to pull it off, in an industry where every penny counts. The rewards would also have been great, with $11m in cost savings a year to be made by combining the company\u2019s operations. Seven would also have been bolstered by Prime\u2019s financial strength \u2013 unlike its big city cousin, the regional broadcaster\u2019s balance sheet is all but free from debt. The deal was endorsed by Prime\u2019s board, headed at the time by former News Corp executive John Hartigan. But in December it fell apart after opposition from two key shareholders \u2013 Gordon, who controlled 11% of the stock, and a company called WA Chess, controlled by mini-mogul Antony Catalano and billionaire Alex Waislitz. Catalano, a former journalist from Melbourne, made his name \u2013 and fortune \u2013 by building a rival group of glossy local newspapers after leaving Fairfax. He sold the group to Fairfax, which spun it into the Domain group, where he was CEO until leaving in 2018. Waislitz, the former son-in-law of box king Richard Pratt, is Catalano\u2019s financial backer. He bankrolled Catalano\u2019s purchase of Australian Community Media, a string of former regional papers Nine sold after taking over Fairfax Media in 2018. These include mastheads in WA, sparking a stoush over printing with Seven\u2019s West Australian News, which has newspapers in the state including the West Australian and a string of regionals. As part of the ACM deal, Catalano acquired a printing press in Mandurah that was geared up for the big page counts \u2013 200 or more for the Mandurah Mail \u2013 and large circulations of print\u2019s golden era. \u201cIt was tremendously profitable and booming in those halcyon days of 2012-13,\u201d a source with knowledge of Fairfax Media\u2019s operations in WA said. \u201cThey\u2019d be struggling now, like all printing operations.\u201d Industry sources say Catalano would like to save money by closing Mandurah and printing on Seven\u2019s presses. \u201cIt was not considered a poor performer but clearly any consolidation with WAN would save costs for both sides,\u201d another source with deep knowledge of Fairfax\u2019s former regional network said. Unfortunately, Catalano\u2019s role in the Prime caper appears to have soured Stokes on the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kerry\u2019s inclined to do anything for him,\u201d one senior industry source said. \u201cThe way that was left after the failed takeover \u2026 I just can\u2019t see them doing any favours for Antony.\u201d Asked whether there had been any discussions about a print deal with ACM, Seven\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cAny commercial discussions SWM is having with any party are confidential.\u201d Catalano didn\u2019t respond to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for comment. But a source close to Catalano played down his responsibility for the collapse of the Prime deal. \u201cI reckon ego got in the way of closing it,\u201d the source said. \u201cBruce and Ant were probably sellers at the right price.\u201d Warburton is not without options. He has already sold the WA radio business, Redwave, for $28m in much-needed cash. Also in the works is the sale of Pacific Magazines, home of titles including New Idea, to rival Bauer, which will reap $40m but is opposed by the competition regulator. Seven is also looking at selling its production studio, which makes programs including soap opera Home &amp; Away. UBS analyst Eric Choi thinks it could fetch as much as $400m. In a note to clients, Choi also said Seven could reap $75m by flogging off land belonging to WAN and leasing it back. These sales would \u201coffset a large portion\u201d of the company\u2019s debt pile, he said. Critics say the sales program will shrink the company\u2019s earnings because much of what is on the block makes money. And it is not clear how much debt Seven needs to get rid of to satisfy its bankers. Seven\u2019s spokesman refused to say how much of the pile falls due in November next year, or clarify the debt covenants to which it has agreed with the banks. \u201cThey\u2019ve got all sorts of banking restrictions they\u2019re going to hit soon,\u201d a well-placed source said. Seven\u2019s spokesman said the media market was \u201cuncertain\u201d. \u201cTo counter uncertainties the directors approved actions to ensure adequate covenant headroom,\u201d he said. \u201cSWM remains well within covenant levels.\u201d At the same time, industry sources insist the psychological blow of losing the spot as number one network to Nine has real consequences. \u201cThe most significant thing is that they\u2019ve been usurped as the number one network,\u201d one source said. \u201cThat can change the whole sense of their performance. \u201cNine has all the momentum, even though it\u2019s a pretty narrow lead.\u201d",

That Cook may have visited the cottage in Great Ayton, North Yorkshire \u2013 home to his parents, James and Grace, in their later years \u2013 is supposition. Historians have found no empirical evidence to support this proposition. There is no definite physical link between the great man and the building. A frenzy of commemoration of the 250th anniversary of Cook\u2019s arrival is about to take place in Australia. Festivities include a $6.7m continental circumnavigation in the replica Endeavour (incidentally Cook never circumnavigated Australia) and $48m to update the Kurnell site (new visitor centre and another memorial) where Cook first set foot, his first act to shoot an Aboriginal man. There\u2019ll be all sorts of hyperbole about Cook from his many prominent boosters, who include the prime minister, Scott Morrison \u2013 the member for Cook \u2013 who says of Cook\u2019s arrival in 1770: \u201cThat voyage is the reason Australia is what it is today and it\u2019s important we take the opportunity to reflect on it.\u201d Let the discussion begin. \u2022 Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist",

I wish I could feel and function normally like anyone else but I find this very hard.</p>\n    <p>I can\u2019t say I have a typical day because some are good, not many, clouded by very bad days. I get up as late as I can so that the day doesn\u2019t seem too long. On a good day I open my curtains, but mostly they stay shut.</p>\n    <p>I find it hard to leave the house on bad days. I don\u2019t want to see anyone or talk to anyone. It\u2019s not nice living this way.</p>\n    <p>I\u2019m afraid to put my heating on and sit with a quilt around me to keep me warm. I dread any mail coming, frightened of what it might be because I don\u2019t have the means to pay and this is very distressing. Most days I go to bed hungry and I feel I\u2019m not even surviving how I should be. Little things that people brush off are big things to me.</p>\n    <p>I have come on my own today because I have been unable to share how I feel with anyone because I don\u2019t think they would understand. It has made me ill to come here today. It is a big ordeal for me.</p>\n    <p>My nerves are terrible and coping with this lifestyle wears me out. Sometimes I can\u2019t stand to even hear the washing machine and I wish I knew why.</p>\n    <p>Being locked away in my flat I feel I don\u2019t have to face anyone. At the same time, it drives me insane. I think I feel more secure on my own with my own company, but wish it wasn\u2019t like that.</p>\n    <p>I\u2019m not a drinker and have never been so don\u2019t think that I\u2019m here to abuse the system. Please judge me fairly. I am a good person but overshadowed by depression. All I want in life is to live normally. That would be the answer to my prayers.</p>\n    <p>Thank you to all for taking the time to read this letter, I really appreciate it. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll cope when I see you all.

But there was plenty to project on to now: an illness that had wildly different effects on people and laid waste to some places while leaving others relatively unscathed, and the way the pandemic triggered social and political changes. \u201cIt influenced the course of the first world war and, arguably, contributed to the second,\u201d writes Spinney. \u201cIt pushed India closer to independence, South Africa closer to apartheid, and Switzerland to the brink of civil war. It ushered in universal healthcare and alternative medicine, our love of fresh air and our passion for sport, and it was probably responsible, at least in part, for the obsession among 20th century artists with all the myriad ways in which the human body can fail.\u201d War, illness and disease are often the locomotive of history, dragging things in no end of unexpected directions. Whatever the vanities of politicians, this is a fact for which there is no antidote. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

Other TV credits include Doc Martin, The Honourable Woman, Humans and Defending the Guilty. She now stars in EV Crowe\u2019s new play Shoe Lady at the Royal Court in London and will soon appear as Barbara Good in the stage revival of sitcom The Good Life in Bristol. What\u2019s Shoe Lady, about? It\u2019s a brilliant piece of writing by Emma Crowe that\u2019s impressionistic and poetic \u2013 which probably makes it sound incredibly worthy but it\u2019s really funny. Essentially, it\u2019s about an estate agent who loses her shoe on the way to work and everything escalates from there because she can\u2019t seem to fit into the world any more. It\u2019s about how close we all are to the edge and the surprising fragility of things the middle classes take for granted. Are you close to the edge yourself? Oh my God, I\u2019m over the edge.

His replacement, Julian Lynch, slotted into the band seamlessly, and the following year\u2019s album, In Mind, picked up where they had left off, showing no dip in form. Which just makes The Main Thing all the more bafflingly anticlimactic. It isn\u2019t that there is very much wrong with it. The elegant guitar lines still evoke Yo La Tengo, and producer Kevin McMahon has coaxed perfectly fine performances from Real Estate and their collaborators (most notably Sylvan Esso\u2019s Amelia Meath on Paper Cup).

But Buttigieg, who has pitched himself as the best moderate candidate, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday he would not quit. \u201cI think the most important thing right now is to look at what we can do to make sure that we put forward a campaign that is going to end the Trump presidency,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cEverywhere I go, Americans are focused on ensuring that we not only get better policies, that we turn the page on all of the things that this president is doing and has done to our country, to our democracy, but also that we turn the page on the tone in our politics and that we move on from this divisive and toxic season in American public life and that continues to be my focus, as it has every day since the campaign began.\u201d On Sunday Biden\u2019s campaign said the former vice-president had raised $5m in donations in the past 24 hours, a record for most online donations in one day for his campaign. He also picked up a string of endorsements, including from former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe and former Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Speaking to CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Biden said he hadn\u2019t had any conversations with other candidates about the need for them to drop out and back him. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a decision for the rest of the field to make as they move forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI think everyone knows it\u2019s going to be much more difficult to win back the Senate and keep control of the House if Bernie\u2019s at the top of the ticket. But that\u2019s a judgment for them to make and I think that will work itself out in the near term.\u201d",

At a White House press conference on Saturday, Trump was forced to defend his use of the word \u201choax\u201d in reference to the outbreak. Strongly criticised by contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, Trump said he had been referring to politicisation of coronavirus, not the outbreak itself. On Sunday, NBC host Chuck Todd played Pence clips of Trump allies discussing the outbreak, which on Saturday claimed its first US death, a man in Washington state. Rush Limbaugh, the conservative shock jock to whom Trump gave the presidential medal of freedom, said: \u201cThe coronavirus is being weaponized, as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump.\u201d Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel said: \u201cDemocrats are using this for their political gain to try and stoke fear in the American people, which is shameful, wrong, and I think un-American.\u201d And Donald Trump Jr, appearing on Fox News, said: \u201cFor them to try to take a pandemic and seemingly hope that it comes here and kills millions of people so that they could end Donald Trump\u2019s streak of winning is a new level of sickness.\u201d On CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday, host Jake Tapper twice asked Pence if he agreed with Trump Jr\u2019s claim that Democrats want coronavirus to \u201ckill millions of people\u201d. Pence avoided the question, instead saying people need to set politics aside in the response to the outbreak and insisting Trump, who at his Friday rally claimed \u201cthe Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans\u201d, was directing all sides to take politics out of the equation. Pence is in charge of White House efforts in response to the outbreak. Saying he was leading \u201cdecisive action to protect the American people\u201d, he told NBC: \u201cAnd when you see voices on our side pushing back on outrageous and irresponsible rhetoric on the other side, I think that\u2019s important, and I think it\u2019s justified.\u201d Todd said: \u201cIt seems like people are taking nervousness and turning it into a political wedge issue.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d Pence replied, \u201cthat\u2019s why my friends that you just played clips of are pushing back as hard as they\u2019re pushing. It is time for the other side to turn down the volume.\u201d The column in question, by Gail Collins, ran on Wednesday under the headline \u201cLet\u2019s call it Trumpvirus\u201d and with a standfirst which read: \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling awful, you know who to blame.\u201d A critical take on Trump\u2019s response to the virus, its first line read: \u201cSo, our Coronavirus Czar is going to be \u2026 Mike Pence. Feeling more secure?\u201d Pence has faced criticism for his record on public health while governor of Indiana, and for his view of science-based policy as a strict Christian. On Saturday night, the Washington Post published a deeply reported account of what it called \u201cthe administration\u2019s slapdash and often misleading attempts to contain not just the virus, but also potential political damage from the outbreak \u2013 which has tanked financial markets, slowed global commerce and killed some 3,000 people worldwide\u201d. A man in his 50s in Washington state is the first person known to have died from coronavirus in the US, but officials said on Saturday they did not know how he contracted the virus. Twenty-two Americans have coronavirus that is either travel-related or was spread from another person, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Of the Americans repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and Wuhan, China, 47 have tested positive for coronavirus. According to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) situation report, there have been reports of 83,652 cases of coronavirus and nearly 2,800 deaths worldwide. The majority of cases are in China but severe outbreaks have been reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy. On Saturday, Pence announced measures including new travel restrictions on Iran and screening of passengers coming to the US from other countries.",

Even the well known concerto for oboe and violin BWV 1060R was recovered from a harpsichord version; Faust played this with the Akademie\u2019s oboist Xenia L\u00f6ffler, and partnered the group\u2019s leader Bernhard Forck in the concerto for two violins. Occasional portamentos and rubatos seemed a little self-conscious, but the lightness and clarity of the performances were exemplary. Between the concertos the Akademie included a symphony (Wq 182/3 in C) written half a century later by Bach\u2019s second surviving son Carl Philipp Emanuel, while Faust and Forck played a trio sonata for two violins and continuo (BWV 529) by Johann Sebastian. For the first of two encores L\u00f6ffler swapped her oboe for a recorder to partner Faust in the opening sonata from Bach\u2019s Cantata No 182, while the second was the final Badinerie from the Suite No 2, with Faust playing the solo part usually heard on a flute, and certainly taking it at a speed that few flautists could even contemplate.",

      "body": "<p>A former interior minister was sworn in as Malaysia\u2019s prime minister on Sunday amid questions over his legitimacy and protests from the country\u2019s former leader Mahathir Mohamad, 94, who lost a battle for power.</p> <p>The appointment of Muhyiddin Yassin, who once described himself as \u201ca Malay first\u201d and who is backed by parties dominated by the country\u2019s ethnic Malay Muslim majority, is likely to cause anxiety among minority communities.</p> <p>Muhyiddin was named as prime minister after a week of political chaos in which the ruling coalition collapsed, alliances were reversed and rival camps rushed to forge backroom deals. Muhyiddin was named prime minister by the king, who the palace had earlier said would meet individually with all 222 MPs to find a way out of the crisis.</p> <p>Mahathir, once the world\u2019s oldest leader, described Muhyiddin\u2019s appointment as illegal and said the palace has refused to hear him out. \u201cWe are going to see a man who does not have majority support become prime minister,\u201d he said, calling for an urgent sitting of parliament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eeb2accd850466f952a83f246e650173ddb61081\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eeb2accd850466f952a83f246e650173ddb61081/0_104_5136_3082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Muhyiddin Yassin signs a document during his swearing-in ceremony\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muhyiddin Yassin during his swearing-in ceremony at the National Palace in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maszuandi Adnan/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Muhyiddin relies on support from Umno, a party mired in corruption scandals, as well as a fundamentalist Islamic party that backs strict Islamic laws. His appointment follows growing dissatisfaction among many in the Malay majority, who accused the previous ruling alliance of caving in to Chinese interests.</p> <p>About 60% of Malaysia\u2019s population are ethnic Malay Muslims, while the country also has large ethnic Chinese and Indian communities. In his previous decades in power Mahathir had prioritised Malay interests, but the coalition he formed with his more liberal rival Anwar Ibrahim in 2018 was unprecedented in its diversity. Muhyiddin\u2019s government is expected to feature more Malays back in key positions and to be more religiously conservative.</p> <p>Power struggles are likely to continue, however. Mahathir is seeking to move a motion of no confidence against Muhyiddin in parliament.</p> <p>\u201cFor Mahathir, it\u2019s not over. Mahathir as a politician has never left politics, even when he retired. The opposition is mobilising,\u201d said Bridget Welsh, an honorary research fellow at the University of Nottingham Malaysia\u2019s Asia research institute.</p> <p>As prime minister, Muhyiddin has the power to dish out cabinet positions and so has an advantage in winning support from MPs. But his government remains fragile and he will face an uphill battle to prove his legitimacy as a leader, added Welsh. \u201cHe comes in with clouds over the process, and questions over whether he really had the numbers,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The political turmoil began on Monday when Mahathir unexpectedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/anwar-ibrahim-decries-traitors-amid-cracks-in-deal-to-make-him-malaysias-next-pm\">resigned as prime minister</a>, causing the government to implode.</p> <p>His resignation followed moves by some in his party to break from the ruling alliance and form a new government. The coalition had long been fraught with tensions and involved an unlikely partnership between Mahathir and Anwar. Anwar was once jailed for sodomy charges under Mahathir but the two united before the 2018 election to oust the government of Najib Razak, which was entangled in the 1MDB graft saga \u2013 often referred to as the world\u2019s biggest case of financial fraud.</p> <p>Anwar was due to succeed Mahathir as prime minister, but Mahathir had refused to set a date for doing so and his supporters had sought to block a handover.</p> <p>Just hours after stepping down on Monday, Mahathir was appointed by the king as interim prime minister, and appeared well placed to launch his own bid for power.

      "bodyText": "A former interior minister was sworn in as Malaysia\u2019s prime minister on Sunday amid questions over his legitimacy and protests from the country\u2019s former leader Mahathir Mohamad, 94, who lost a battle for power. The appointment of Muhyiddin Yassin, who once described himself as \u201ca Malay first\u201d and who is backed by parties dominated by the country\u2019s ethnic Malay Muslim majority, is likely to cause anxiety among minority communities. Muhyiddin was named as prime minister after a week of political chaos in which the ruling coalition collapsed, alliances were reversed and rival camps rushed to forge backroom deals. Muhyiddin was named prime minister by the king, who the palace had earlier said would meet individually with all 222 MPs to find a way out of the crisis. Mahathir, once the world\u2019s oldest leader, described Muhyiddin\u2019s appointment as illegal and said the palace has refused to hear him out. \u201cWe are going to see a man who does not have majority support become prime minister,\u201d he said, calling for an urgent sitting of parliament. Muhyiddin relies on support from Umno, a party mired in corruption scandals, as well as a fundamentalist Islamic party that backs strict Islamic laws. His appointment follows growing dissatisfaction among many in the Malay majority, who accused the previous ruling alliance of caving in to Chinese interests. About 60% of Malaysia\u2019s population are ethnic Malay Muslims, while the country also has large ethnic Chinese and Indian communities. In his previous decades in power Mahathir had prioritised Malay interests, but the coalition he formed with his more liberal rival Anwar Ibrahim in 2018 was unprecedented in its diversity. Muhyiddin\u2019s government is expected to feature more Malays back in key positions and to be more religiously conservative. Power struggles are likely to continue, however. Mahathir is seeking to move a motion of no confidence against Muhyiddin in parliament. \u201cFor Mahathir, it\u2019s not over. Mahathir as a politician has never left politics, even when he retired. The opposition is mobilising,\u201d said Bridget Welsh, an honorary research fellow at the University of Nottingham Malaysia\u2019s Asia research institute. As prime minister, Muhyiddin has the power to dish out cabinet positions and so has an advantage in winning support from MPs. But his government remains fragile and he will face an uphill battle to prove his legitimacy as a leader, added Welsh. \u201cHe comes in with clouds over the process, and questions over whether he really had the numbers,\u201d she said. The political turmoil began on Monday when Mahathir unexpectedly resigned as prime minister, causing the government to implode. His resignation followed moves by some in his party to break from the ruling alliance and form a new government. The coalition had long been fraught with tensions and involved an unlikely partnership between Mahathir and Anwar. Anwar was once jailed for sodomy charges under Mahathir but the two united before the 2018 election to oust the government of Najib Razak, which was entangled in the 1MDB graft saga \u2013 often referred to as the world\u2019s biggest case of financial fraud. Anwar was due to succeed Mahathir as prime minister, but Mahathir had refused to set a date for doing so and his supporters had sought to block a handover. Just hours after stepping down on Monday, Mahathir was appointed by the king as interim prime minister, and appeared well placed to launch his own bid for power. But rival factions raced to prove to the king that they commanded enough support from MPs, and on Saturday Muhyiddin was named prime minister. In a statement, the palace said the process of appointing a leader \u201ccannot be delayed because the country needs a government for the wellbeing of the people and the nation\u201d. Some would welcome the appointment and hope simply for an end to the political upheaval, said Welsh, but she added that it would cause deep concern in other quarters. \u201cThey have returned power to people who were kicked out. Ironically this has been done by someone who was sacked [from Umno] and now has come back to the fold,\u201d she added. Muhyiddin, 72, was a member of Umno for decades and was deputy prime minister in Najib\u2019s government. Najib sacked him after he questioned the then prime minister\u2019s handling of allegations surrounding the 1MDB scandal. With Muhyiddin reliant on support from the former regime, there are questions over whether those implicated in the saga will be held to account.",

There would be structures for intelligence-sharing and involvement in joint defence research and innovation. UK: The issue of defence cooperation does not emerge once in the UK\u2019s negotiating mandate. And on foreign policy, the UK merely suggests \u201cfriendly dialogue and cooperation\u201d. These areas \u201cdo not require an institutionalised relationship\u201d, the paper adds. The UK is the pre-eminent actor in European defence in terms of intelligence and defence spending. It is not offering to give the EU anything before seeing how the trade talks develop. Transport EU: British lorry drivers would no longer have the same rights as their EU counterparts to deliver goods between EU member states, although they would be able to transport items between the UK and EU. However, this access would depend on the government maintaining EU-level standards on workers\u2019 rights. In contrast, the UK wants British hauliers to be able to provide services without restrictions, which it acknowledges has no direct EU precedent, although it argues that some EU countries have similar bilateral treaties. UK: British aviation companies should be able to operate flights between the UK and EU, without barriers. In an attempt to protect British Airways and its owner IAG, the UK argues against \u201cunnecessary restrictions\u201d on the nationality of who can control a British or EU airline. The EU stresses that the UK cannot have the same rights and benefits as an EU member state. Science and research EU: Brussels is playing hard to get. The UK is the third most popular country of destination for Erasmus students and its scientific hubs are a major driver of EU research programmes. Involvement will all come down to hard cash \u2013 of which the EU is decidedly short following the UK\u2019s exit. UK: The British government is equally coy and says it will \u201cconsider a relationship in line with non-EU member state participation\u201d in key research programmes such as Horizon Europe, which brings together European scientists, Euratom Research and Training, and Copernicus, the programme for monitoring the Earth from space. The two sides will have to engage in a tough negotiation in terms of payments into the programmes and the level of leadership UK actors will have.",

The latest bout of extreme weather comes after the country experienced the wettest February since records began. Data from the Met Office shows that an average of 202.1mm of rainfall fell last month, surpassing records for February 1990 when 193.4mm fell. By lunchtime on Sunday, 84 flood warnings remained in place across England, including many in east Yorkshire. In Snaith, where residents were evacuated from their homes earlier in the week, the Environment Agency has deployed a further four pumps in addition to the 18 already installed to reduce flooding in the town. East Riding council has urged residents living in affected areas to \u201cremain vigilant\u201d as the deluge continues, although there were no evacuations in the region for the first night since flooding started. Overwhelmed flood barriers at Ironbridge in Shropshire, which also led to an emergency evacuation, were fixed on Friday, while a severe weather warning \u2013 meaning danger to life \u2013 was also downgraded. On Sunday, the Environment Agency reported that water levels in the area were rising again and were expected to peak between 5.4 and 5.7 metres on Monday afternoon. Telford and Wrekin council said levels would hopefully be at least a metre lower than last week, while more local businesses were reopening. On Saturday, when many yellow Met Office warnings for rain remained in place, several flooded roads were closed in Wiltshire and people were rescued from cars stranded in both Devon and Somerset. The area surrounding the River Ouse, along which some flood warnings remained in place on Sunday, was also temporarily closed to high-sided vehicles in Humberside as winds reached up to 70mph. In south Wales, police declared a critical incident during Britain\u2019s fourth weekend of downpours, with Pontypridd and the Ely area of Cardiff among the worst affected areas. Residents were advised to stay indoors to avoid winds of up to 70mph and were told water levels could rise further, but the incident was no longer in place by mid-morning on Saturday. A number of flights were diverted to Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic because of high winds across the island, while a lorry overturned as winds battered the N59 in Galway. On Sunday, only one yellow weather warning for snow was in place across parts of Scotland, while ice is expected to form overnight in north-western England and Scotland, bringing disruption to commuters on Monday morning. National Rail said many services were still disrupted because of damage caused by the storm. Trains between Sheffield and Worksop were likely to be delayed on Sunday because of a landslip north of the city. A bus replacement will be in place between Aberdare and Pontypridd until Wednesday after the line was damaged, while a section of the Conwy Valley line between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Llandudno, is still closed due to damage caused by Storm Ciara.

They\u2019re all at war.\u201d That \u201cwar\u201d emerged in public in a most surprising manner last week when the high court heard that Sir Frederick had been bugged at the Barclays-owned Ritz hotel by one of Sir David\u2019s sons with the apparent complicity of his two brothers. That legal case, which involves allegations of the misuse of private information, breaches of confidence and data protection, will play itself out at some future date. But there is now no doubt about the significance of the fraternal dispute. It is Sir David\u2019s sons \u2013 Aidan and Howard \u2013 who have been responsible for the day-to-day running of TMG, but their attempts to ready it for sale, as the clumsy management tactics illustrate, have been anything but successful. Nor does the paper\u2019s editorial line help. Having hitched itself to the Johnson bandwagon, it was all very well campaigning for him and for Brexit. But he is in Downing Street now and, like all prime ministers, at the mercy of events, dear boy, events. All governments become unpopular in the end, and defending the prime minister will prove altogether more tricky than attacking on his behalf. What price then for the Daily Boris?",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

Alabama has restrictive policies: people have to show a photo ID to vote and there is no early voting. People with felonies also face severe hurdles to regaining their voting rights. Selma, the birthplace of voting rights as we know them, is grappling with such policies and with economic distress. \u201cSelma is stagnant, we can\u2019t move forward,\u201d said Jesse Marvin, of the unemployment and challenges in his hometown. For him, fighting for civil rights was a family affair: he and his older siblings protested regularly, often landing in jail. And while his parents \u201cdidn\u2019t get involved with anything to do with white folks\u201d, his mom helped in church kitchens where activists gathered. Reflecting on Selma and the election, Marvin said the state of politics and civil rights today was hard to stomach, especially given the history he witnessed and the rights for which he marched. He was carefully researching the candidates before going to vote. At the high school cafeteria on Saturday, and throughout the weekend, conversation oscillated between the past and present \u2013 a narrative the people of Selma know well. But unlike the political debates, or the televised press conferences, the living memory of marching for, and receiving, civil rights seemed to underlie the fear and frustration. Charles Mauldin, who marched as a 17 year old on Bloody Sunday, said the fact young people had come to listen to the stories gave him a sense of hope. \u201cAs desperate as the political climate seems,\u201d he said, \u201cI feel very optimistic that young people will rise up like we did.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Before Susan Fowler was a whistleblower she was a violinist, and before she was a violinist she fed fruit flies to spiders that were milked for their venom at a small Arizona business known as Spider Pharm. In February 2017, Fowler was thrown into the public eye after she published a damning blogpost exposing the toxic sexism she experienced working as a software engineer at Uber. And in her new memoir, <em>Whistleblower</em>, she explains how she came to shake up one of the world\u2019s most valuable startups. But, despite the title of her book, Fowler defies one-word labels. She is a musician, a writer, a physicist, a philosopher: a person who demands to be seen, she has written, as more than \u201cthat woman who was sexually harassed\u201d.</p> <p>Six million people read <a href=\"https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber\" title=\"\">Fowler\u2019s blogpost</a> in which she chronicled her time at what was then the No 1 disrupter in Silicon Valley. In the post \u2013 titled \u201cReflecting On One Very, Very Strange Year At Uber\u201d \u2013 Fowler recounted how she was pestered by her new boss on her first official day at the company. \u201cHe was in an open relationship, he said, and his girlfriend was having an easy time finding new partners but he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Fowler recalled. \u201cIt was clear that he was trying to get me to have sex with him.\u201d Fowler immediately reported the conversation to HR.</p> <p>The manager was let off the hook because he was a \u201chigh performer\u201d. That was just the beginning of the sexism Fowler would face there. Over the course of her year at Uber, she was given negative performance reviews by another boss, who wanted to prevent her being promoted and thus keep her and other women on his team, and was told she was \u201cthe common theme\u201d in all the reports she made to HR about sexist comments. In one bizarre incident, 120 male engineers were rewarded with official leather jackets, while the six women engineers were told that jackets for them were unaffordable.</p> <p>Fowler\u2019s blogpost was instantly explosive. It was shared about 22,000 times on Twitter alone, and Fowler recalls going to a book shop a few hours after posting and overhearing two people \u201carguing about whether I was telling the truth\u201d. A day after the post, former US attorney general Eric Holder was hired to conduct an independent review on Uber\u2019s working environment; the investigation was to be overseen by Arianna Huffington and Uber\u2019s chief HR officer. Fowler\u2019s post inspired the tech industry\u2019s MeToo half a year before the #MeToo hashtag even existed, as other women came forward with stories of sexism in Silicon Valley. In the summer, venture capitalist Dave McClure resigned and wrote a blogpost called \u201cI\u2019m a Creep. I\u2019m Sorry\u201d after the <em>New York Times</em> reported he had sent sexually inappropriate messages to a potential employee. In December 2017, Fowler and four other women (among them Taylor Swift) were chosen as <em>Time</em> magazine\u2019s people of the year, \u201cthe silence breakers\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91e50f6a0eb9db0984c249cb41be2aafc5cc9778\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91e50f6a0eb9db0984c249cb41be2aafc5cc9778/0_0_2363_3150/750.jpg\" alt=\"Fowler (second right) was one of the \u2018silence breakers\u2019 made Time magazine\u2019s people of the year 2017\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fowler (second right) was one of the \u2018silence breakers\u2019 who were <em>Time </em>magazine\u2019s people of the year 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Fowler says over the phone from New York, when I ask why her post gained such traction. \u201cAt the time no information I had told me that my story would be treated differently from anyone else\u2019s.\u201d Fowler had spent a year at Uber trying to get the company to care about sexism and bullying \u2013 her complaints had always fallen on deaf ears. \u201cI was speaking the truth in a system that doesn\u2019t value the truth, but as soon as you go out of it, then speaking the truth actually has an impact. It turns out a lot of people care\u2026 not everybody is interested in ignoring bad behaviour. I learned I had to go outside the system.\u201d</p> <p>In truth, it is likely that the response to Fowler\u2019s post was connected to a wider backlash against Uber that was occurring at the time (the \u201cCriticism\u201d section on Uber\u2019s Wikipedia page now includes 21 separate items). A month before Fowler\u2019s expos\u00e9, Uber agreed to pay $20m to the US government after the Federal Trade Commission accused the company of misleading drivers about potential earnings, while six months before that, the press had begun to uncover sexual harassment by Uber drivers. After a BuzzFeed News investigation, Uber revealed there had been 170 customer reports (by English-speaking users) with a \u201clegitimate claim of sexual assault\u201d between December 2012 and August 2015, while a freedom of information request by the <em>Sun </em>found 32 London drivers had been accused of assault between 2015 and 2016.</p> <p>Holder\u2019s investigation into Uber concluded that the company\u2019s culture was broken and advised improved HR training and better complaint tracking procedures. Holder also recommended that Uber \u201creview and reallocate the responsibilities of Travis Kalanick\u201d, Uber\u2019s CEO at the time. Kalanick reportedly had knowledge of sexual harassment allegations within the company and failed to act, and had a reputation himself for inappropriate behaviour (in 2014, he boasted about his status in the company attracting women \u2013 \u201cWe call that Boob-er\u201d). On 21 June 2017, he resigned as CEO.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was hard to  revisit. These were some of the most extreme and painful experiences of my life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On her first day at Uberversity \u2013 Uber\u2019s three-day-long training programme for new recruits \u2013 Fowler and her class were told that they weren\u2019t allowed to date \u201cTK\u201d. Confusion abounded as the instructor told them \u201cthat she knew all of us wanted to date TK, but it was, she said with a sigh, against the rules\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until later that Fowler realised TK was Kalanick \u2013 in <em>Whistleblower</em> she recounts a brief interaction where she encouraged him to dance to improve the mood at a Christmas party. How much does Fowler believe Kalanick\u2019s resignation solved the problems at Uber? While she believes a culture of workplace bullying originated from the top, she also describes the company\u2019s problems as \u201csystemic\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAt Uber, every time something happened I would escalate it, and eventually got to the point where I was sitting across from the CTO [chief technology officer], and telling him everything that was going on. He promised to fix it and promised to take it seriously, just like all the HR people before,\u201d Fowler says. \u201cAnd then he sent someone from HR to speak to me and it was the same thing: this is their first offence, they\u2019re a high performer, we don\u2019t feel comfortable punishing them, we\u2019ve given them a stern warning. I remember thinking: \u2018This isn\u2019t just one manager, this is every HR person here and everyone up my management chain\u2026\u2019 I had to leave.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/22/uber-cto-thuan-pham-susan-fowler-travis-kalanick\">Uber criticized for standing by executive accused of ignoring discrimination claim</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That chief technology officer is Thuan Pham, still Uber\u2019s CTO today. According to an investigation by digital media company the Information, Pham was allowed to keep his job after sharing evidence with Holder that proved he took Fowler\u2019s case seriously after their meeting. She describes feeling hopeful after their conversation and angry and tearful when she finally heard from Pham\u2019s HR liaison, who said Uber would not fire a manager who threatened her job after she reported him to HR. Fowler had told Pham how that manager had blocked her transfer to another department so he could earn kudos for having women on his team (when Fowler joined Uber, 25% of its engineers were women \u2013 by the time she left, they made up just 6%).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3716b122d2c3039ba108dda5720a16bd9c2e78f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3716b122d2c3039ba108dda5720a16bd9c2e78f7/0_0_5528_3685/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Fowler is honoured at the 22nd Annual Webby awards in New York, 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fowler is honoured at the 22nd Annual Webby awards in New York, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Kropa/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When asked how she feels about the fact that Pham is still employed by Uber, Fowler is diplomatic. \u201cWhat I do hope is things have changed, and that what happened to me won\u2019t happen to anyone else again,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Most of Fowler\u2019s friends have now left Uber, and she says she has no insight into how it is run today. \u201cI hope that things are getting better \u2013 it\u2019s been three years!\u201d she laughs. When she wrote her blogpost, she was working at another startup, Stripe, but just over year and a half later, she joined the <em>New York Times</em> as a technology editor. She sounds very happy when she speaks of her career in journalism, and seems pleased to declare herself \u201coutside\u201d the tech industry now. In <em>Whistleblower</em>\u2019s epilogue she describes her new priorities: writing, learning languages, reading <em>Go, Dog. Go!</em> to her infant daughter.</p> <p>\u201cIt was hard to revisit,\u201d she says of writing <em>Whistleblower</em>, \u201cThese were some of the most extreme and painful experiences of my life.\u201d It\u2019s no wonder that Fowler is so happy to have moved on \u2013 after her blogpost exploded, private investigators began prying into her personal life, attempting to discredit her. Strangers would ring her family and friends and ask questions about her past, rumours spread that Uber competitor Lyft had paid her to write her post, men followed her on foot and in cars. \u201cIt was terrifying because I didn\u2019t know what they were looking for or what their goal was, or what they wanted to do with the information,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was very, very scary.\u201d</p> <p>Yet despite these experiences, Fowler wants readers to go away thinking not that she is \u201cthe woman who was harassed at Uber\u201d but rather \u201cthe woman who stood up and spoke out about harassment at Uber\u201d. Less the story of how Fowler became a victim, <em>Whistleblower</em> is more of a guide to how she became a hero. She is most animated during our conversation when talking about the philosophers she read as a teen who informed her moral code \u2013 Plato, Epictetus, Isaiah Berlin.</p> <p>\u201cI did not have control over my circumstances but I did have control over my character, the decisions I made, the actions I took, and the things that I said. And that was so important for me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The most powerful way to tell the truth is with documentation. Then nobody can say it\u2019s a \u2018he says, she says\u2019 situation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fowler\u2019s determination to blow the whistle on Uber had its roots in an incident in her past when she felt she had \u201cvery much been morally obligated to speak out and didn\u2019t\u201d. While studying physics at the University of Pennsylvania, Fowler befriended a student named Tim, who became suicidal. When she sought help from the administration, she was told that Tim was her problem. Tim grew increasingly erratic, and threatened to kill himself if Fowler did not return his romantic affections. When Fowler sought help again, the university blamed her for upsetting Tim and tried to remove her from classes she shared with him before rescinding her master\u2019s degree. When she pursued her complaints, the university claimed to have \u201cevidence\u201d that she lied about her relationship with Tim (they wouldn\u2019t show her this evidence). Though she contacted lawyers and considered suing, she ultimately \u201cdecided to move on with my life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how everything that happened in my life then was preparing me for this moment,\u201d Fowler says today. \u201cI learned all these big lessons so when the time came to blow the whistle on Uber, I was ready.\u201d By the time she worked at Uber, Fowler says, it was \u201csecond nature\u201d to screenshot, report, and forward any \u201cweird\u201d interactions, as well as save this evidence to the cloud and print off hard copies. She says her book is a way to share those lessons with others. \u201cThe most powerful thing you can do is tell the truth, and the most powerful way you can tell the truth is with all this documentation. Then nobody can say it\u2019s a \u2018he says, she says\u2019 situation because look, I have the evidence.\u201d</p> <p>Though these lessons are universal, Fowler\u2019s account is intensely personal. She doesn\u2019t reference #MeToo or write at any length about accusations of sexual assault by Uber drivers. Her story is very much her own \u2013 she documents living in poverty, falling in love with the violin, getting her first job at Spider Pharm aged 11, and home-schooling herself. She paints a picture of a ferociously independent and determined person: as a student at Penn, she would fall asleep immersed in her textbooks, eager to teach herself the science and maths she needed to keep up. She also admits to things that private investigators would no doubt have loved to dig up \u2013 after her father died of brain cancer when she was a student, she checked herself into a mental health facility.</p> <p>\u201cI almost didn\u2019t include that\u2026 but I realised I didn\u2019t want people who\u2019d been through something similar to think they couldn\u2019t speak up too,\u201d she says. Her book is a way to provide a \u201cfuller picture\u201d than a magazine cover, she adds, to show that you don\u2019t have to be the perfect victim to blow the whistle.</p> <p>\u201cI want to encourage people to speak up no matter what, and the best way for me to do that is to be open about my life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33ba44e8a5c4683a22f6cb91da4d52c13fa7dd55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33ba44e8a5c4683a22f6cb91da4d52c13fa7dd55/0_169_5832_3696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fowler with a festival goer following her Power of a Story session at the 2019 SXSW conference in Austin, Texas,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fowler with a festival goer following her Power of a Story session at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, last year,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rita Quinn/Getty Images for SXSW</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Can we really expect individual women to find solutions to the problem of systemic harassment?

Uber isn\u2019t even the first startup where Fowler faced discrimination. After university, she was hired by the financial services company Plaid, where she learned her male peers were being paid $50,000 more than she was. After that, she worked at software company PubNub, where her boss made gasp-inducing statements that led Fowler to believe he \u201ctruly, deeply, passionately hated women\u201d.</p> <p>All in all, it paints a depressing picture of life as a female engineer. Fowler says she \u201crealised I really wasn\u2019t welcome in those environments\u201d, but also says she doesn\u2019t want to dissuade other women from entering the field. \u201cI don\u2019t want to discourage any young women from pursuing their dreams. I think the best thing they can do is understand what their rights are and stand up for themselves and advocate for themselves, and then when things start to go wrong just speak out. The more of us who speak out, the louder our voices will be, until they just can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d</p> <p>Fowler\u2019s memoir ends with her riding in a Lyft \u2013 Uber\u2019s rival in the US. Is it a final \u201cfuck you\u201d to Uber? Evidence for conspiracy theorists to pounce upon?</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re the only ones who will drive me around!\u201d she laughs. \u201cUber banned me, so I can\u2019t sign up.

      "bodyText": "Before Susan Fowler was a whistleblower she was a violinist, and before she was a violinist she fed fruit flies to spiders that were milked for their venom at a small Arizona business known as Spider Pharm. In February 2017, Fowler was thrown into the public eye after she published a damning blogpost exposing the toxic sexism she experienced working as a software engineer at Uber. And in her new memoir, Whistleblower, she explains how she came to shake up one of the world\u2019s most valuable startups. But, despite the title of her book, Fowler defies one-word labels. She is a musician, a writer, a physicist, a philosopher: a person who demands to be seen, she has written, as more than \u201cthat woman who was sexually harassed\u201d. Six million people read Fowler\u2019s blogpost in which she chronicled her time at what was then the No 1 disrupter in Silicon Valley. In the post \u2013 titled \u201cReflecting On One Very, Very Strange Year At Uber\u201d \u2013 Fowler recounted how she was pestered by her new boss on her first official day at the company. \u201cHe was in an open relationship, he said, and his girlfriend was having an easy time finding new partners but he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Fowler recalled. \u201cIt was clear that he was trying to get me to have sex with him.\u201d Fowler immediately reported the conversation to HR. The manager was let off the hook because he was a \u201chigh performer\u201d. That was just the beginning of the sexism Fowler would face there. Over the course of her year at Uber, she was given negative performance reviews by another boss, who wanted to prevent her being promoted and thus keep her and other women on his team, and was told she was \u201cthe common theme\u201d in all the reports she made to HR about sexist comments. In one bizarre incident, 120 male engineers were rewarded with official leather jackets, while the six women engineers were told that jackets for them were unaffordable. Fowler\u2019s blogpost was instantly explosive. It was shared about 22,000 times on Twitter alone, and Fowler recalls going to a book shop a few hours after posting and overhearing two people \u201carguing about whether I was telling the truth\u201d. A day after the post, former US attorney general Eric Holder was hired to conduct an independent review on Uber\u2019s working environment; the investigation was to be overseen by Arianna Huffington and Uber\u2019s chief HR officer. Fowler\u2019s post inspired the tech industry\u2019s MeToo half a year before the #MeToo hashtag even existed, as other women came forward with stories of sexism in Silicon Valley. In the summer, venture capitalist Dave McClure resigned and wrote a blogpost called \u201cI\u2019m a Creep. I\u2019m Sorry\u201d after the New York Times reported he had sent sexually inappropriate messages to a potential employee. In December 2017, Fowler and four other women (among them Taylor Swift) were chosen as Time magazine\u2019s people of the year, \u201cthe silence breakers\u201d. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d Fowler says over the phone from New York, when I ask why her post gained such traction. \u201cAt the time no information I had told me that my story would be treated differently from anyone else\u2019s.\u201d Fowler had spent a year at Uber trying to get the company to care about sexism and bullying \u2013 her complaints had always fallen on deaf ears. \u201cI was speaking the truth in a system that doesn\u2019t value the truth, but as soon as you go out of it, then speaking the truth actually has an impact. It turns out a lot of people care\u2026 not everybody is interested in ignoring bad behaviour. I learned I had to go outside the system.\u201d In truth, it is likely that the response to Fowler\u2019s post was connected to a wider backlash against Uber that was occurring at the time (the \u201cCriticism\u201d section on Uber\u2019s Wikipedia page now includes 21 separate items). A month before Fowler\u2019s expos\u00e9, Uber agreed to pay $20m to the US government after the Federal Trade Commission accused the company of misleading drivers about potential earnings, while six months before that, the press had begun to uncover sexual harassment by Uber drivers. After a BuzzFeed News investigation, Uber revealed there had been 170 customer reports (by English-speaking users) with a \u201clegitimate claim of sexual assault\u201d between December 2012 and August 2015, while a freedom of information request by the Sun found 32 London drivers had been accused of assault between 2015 and 2016. Holder\u2019s investigation into Uber concluded that the company\u2019s culture was broken and advised improved HR training and better complaint tracking procedures. Holder also recommended that Uber \u201creview and reallocate the responsibilities of Travis Kalanick\u201d, Uber\u2019s CEO at the time. Kalanick reportedly had knowledge of sexual harassment allegations within the company and failed to act, and had a reputation himself for inappropriate behaviour (in 2014, he boasted about his status in the company attracting women \u2013 \u201cWe call that Boob-er\u201d). On 21 June 2017, he resigned as CEO. On her first day at Uberversity \u2013 Uber\u2019s three-day-long training programme for new recruits \u2013 Fowler and her class were told that they weren\u2019t allowed to date \u201cTK\u201d. Confusion abounded as the instructor told them \u201cthat she knew all of us wanted to date TK, but it was, she said with a sigh, against the rules\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until later that Fowler realised TK was Kalanick \u2013 in Whistleblower she recounts a brief interaction where she encouraged him to dance to improve the mood at a Christmas party. How much does Fowler believe Kalanick\u2019s resignation solved the problems at Uber? While she believes a culture of workplace bullying originated from the top, she also describes the company\u2019s problems as \u201csystemic\u201d. \u201cAt Uber, every time something happened I would escalate it, and eventually got to the point where I was sitting across from the CTO [chief technology officer], and telling him everything that was going on. He promised to fix it and promised to take it seriously, just like all the HR people before,\u201d Fowler says. \u201cAnd then he sent someone from HR to speak to me and it was the same thing: this is their first offence, they\u2019re a high performer, we don\u2019t feel comfortable punishing them, we\u2019ve given them a stern warning. I remember thinking: \u2018This isn\u2019t just one manager, this is every HR person here and everyone up my management chain\u2026\u2019 I had to leave.\u201d That chief technology officer is Thuan Pham, still Uber\u2019s CTO today. According to an investigation by digital media company the Information, Pham was allowed to keep his job after sharing evidence with Holder that proved he took Fowler\u2019s case seriously after their meeting. She describes feeling hopeful after their conversation and angry and tearful when she finally heard from Pham\u2019s HR liaison, who said Uber would not fire a manager who threatened her job after she reported him to HR. Fowler had told Pham how that manager had blocked her transfer to another department so he could earn kudos for having women on his team (when Fowler joined Uber, 25% of its engineers were women \u2013 by the time she left, they made up just 6%). When asked how she feels about the fact that Pham is still employed by Uber, Fowler is diplomatic. \u201cWhat I do hope is things have changed, and that what happened to me won\u2019t happen to anyone else again,\u201d she says. Most of Fowler\u2019s friends have now left Uber, and she says she has no insight into how it is run today. \u201cI hope that things are getting better \u2013 it\u2019s been three years!\u201d she laughs. When she wrote her blogpost, she was working at another startup, Stripe, but just over year and a half later, she joined the New York Times as a technology editor. She sounds very happy when she speaks of her career in journalism, and seems pleased to declare herself \u201coutside\u201d the tech industry now. In Whistleblower\u2019s epilogue she describes her new priorities: writing, learning languages, reading Go, Dog. Go! to her infant daughter. \u201cIt was hard to revisit,\u201d she says of writing Whistleblower, \u201cThese were some of the most extreme and painful experiences of my life.\u201d It\u2019s no wonder that Fowler is so happy to have moved on \u2013 after her blogpost exploded, private investigators began prying into her personal life, attempting to discredit her. Strangers would ring her family and friends and ask questions about her past, rumours spread that Uber competitor Lyft had paid her to write her post, men followed her on foot and in cars. \u201cIt was terrifying because I didn\u2019t know what they were looking for or what their goal was, or what they wanted to do with the information,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was very, very scary.\u201d Yet despite these experiences, Fowler wants readers to go away thinking not that she is \u201cthe woman who was harassed at Uber\u201d but rather \u201cthe woman who stood up and spoke out about harassment at Uber\u201d. Less the story of how Fowler became a victim, Whistleblower is more of a guide to how she became a hero. She is most animated during our conversation when talking about the philosophers she read as a teen who informed her moral code \u2013 Plato, Epictetus, Isaiah Berlin. \u201cI did not have control over my circumstances but I did have control over my character, the decisions I made, the actions I took, and the things that I said. And that was so important for me.\u201d Fowler\u2019s determination to blow the whistle on Uber had its roots in an incident in her past when she felt she had \u201cvery much been morally obligated to speak out and didn\u2019t\u201d. While studying physics at the University of Pennsylvania, Fowler befriended a student named Tim, who became suicidal. When she sought help from the administration, she was told that Tim was her problem. Tim grew increasingly erratic, and threatened to kill himself if Fowler did not return his romantic affections. When Fowler sought help again, the university blamed her for upsetting Tim and tried to remove her from classes she shared with him before rescinding her master\u2019s degree. When she pursued her complaints, the university claimed to have \u201cevidence\u201d that she lied about her relationship with Tim (they wouldn\u2019t show her this evidence). Though she contacted lawyers and considered suing, she ultimately \u201cdecided to move on with my life\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how everything that happened in my life then was preparing me for this moment,\u201d Fowler says today. \u201cI learned all these big lessons so when the time came to blow the whistle on Uber, I was ready.\u201d By the time she worked at Uber, Fowler says, it was \u201csecond nature\u201d to screenshot, report, and forward any \u201cweird\u201d interactions, as well as save this evidence to the cloud and print off hard copies. She says her book is a way to share those lessons with others. \u201cThe most powerful thing you can do is tell the truth, and the most powerful way you can tell the truth is with all this documentation. Then nobody can say it\u2019s a \u2018he says, she says\u2019 situation because look, I have the evidence.\u201d Though these lessons are universal, Fowler\u2019s account is intensely personal. She doesn\u2019t reference #MeToo or write at any length about accusations of sexual assault by Uber drivers. Her story is very much her own \u2013 she documents living in poverty, falling in love with the violin, getting her first job at Spider Pharm aged 11, and home-schooling herself. She paints a picture of a ferociously independent and determined person: as a student at Penn, she would fall asleep immersed in her textbooks, eager to teach herself the science and maths she needed to keep up. She also admits to things that private investigators would no doubt have loved to dig up \u2013 after her father died of brain cancer when she was a student, she checked herself into a mental health facility. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t include that\u2026 but I realised I didn\u2019t want people who\u2019d been through something similar to think they couldn\u2019t speak up too,\u201d she says. Her book is a way to provide a \u201cfuller picture\u201d than a magazine cover, she adds, to show that you don\u2019t have to be the perfect victim to blow the whistle. \u201cI want to encourage people to speak up no matter what, and the best way for me to do that is to be open about my life.\u201d Can we really expect individual women to find solutions to the problem of systemic harassment? It\u2019s one thing to inspire women to speak out; quite another to persuade them try to change the conditions in which harassment occurs. \u201cI know, that\u2019s the paradox, right?\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the painful part\u2026 because we know it\u2019s very scary and we know what happens to women who speak out.\u201d In the end, though, she says: \u201cYou have to do what\u2019s right for you \u2013 in myself I felt a deep moral obligation.\u201d The jury is still out on whether meaningful changes have occurred in Silicon Valley in the three years since Fowler\u2019s blogpost (another memoir released in January, Uncanny Valley by Anna Wiener, also describes an industry rife with sexual harassment). Uber isn\u2019t even the first startup where Fowler faced discrimination. After university, she was hired by the financial services company Plaid, where she learned her male peers were being paid $50,000 more than she was. After that, she worked at software company PubNub, where her boss made gasp-inducing statements that led Fowler to believe he \u201ctruly, deeply, passionately hated women\u201d. All in all, it paints a depressing picture of life as a female engineer. Fowler says she \u201crealised I really wasn\u2019t welcome in those environments\u201d, but also says she doesn\u2019t want to dissuade other women from entering the field. \u201cI don\u2019t want to discourage any young women from pursuing their dreams. I think the best thing they can do is understand what their rights are and stand up for themselves and advocate for themselves, and then when things start to go wrong just speak out. The more of us who speak out, the louder our voices will be, until they just can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d Fowler\u2019s memoir ends with her riding in a Lyft \u2013 Uber\u2019s rival in the US. Is it a final \u201cfuck you\u201d to Uber? Evidence for conspiracy theorists to pounce upon? \u201cThey\u2019re the only ones who will drive me around!\u201d she laughs. \u201cUber banned me, so I can\u2019t sign up. I tried signing up and it said they can\u2019t complete my registration, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeaa\u2013aah, I wonder why!\u201d \u2022 Whistleblower: My Journey to Silicon Valley and Fight for Justice at Uber by Susan Fowler is published by Viking (\u00a320).

Decades later, while interviewing Ulv\u00e6us, his hunch is confirmed. If there\u2019s a weak area of the book, it is in the rare moments when Paphides introduces non-music asides that involve a leap forward in time. There\u2019s mention of Brexit and Boris Johnson, tangents that jar. But \u2013 to repurpose a joke from Paphides \u2013 it\u2019s small fry. Because, as well as producing writing that conjures some visually stunning images (a mass of school pupils is a \u201cmurmuration of green blazers\u201d), Paphides is funny: \u201cI didn\u2019t know who Lulu was, but I knew she was important, because like Sting, Odysseus and Kojak, she only had one name.\u201d Broken Greek isn\u2019t all about the transcendent joy of discovering new bands. There are flashes of racism; and Paphides\u2019s parents spend much of the time miserable, largely from working themselves too hard \u2013 in the case of Victoria, to the point of a hospital stay. But they clearly love their children (even if Dad isn\u2019t always good at showing it) and incidents of kindness and friendship abound, despite economic and marital struggles. Paphides points out, rightly, that great pop should require no effort from the listener. I don\u2019t believe this is entirely true of literature, but this is a memoir that carries you along with all the breeziness and addictive properties of, appropriately, a Dexys Midnight Runners track. A smash hit. \u2022 Broken Greek: A Story of Chip Shops and Pop Songs by Pete Paphides is published by Quercus (\u00a320). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com. Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315",

      "body": "<p>The physicist Freeman Dyson, who has died aged 96, became famous within science for mathematical solutions so advanced that they could only be applied to complex problems of atomic theory and popular with the public for ideas so far-fetched they seemed beyond lunacy.</p> <p>As a young postgraduate student, Dyson devised \u2013 while taking a Greyhound bus ride in America \u2013 the answer to a conundrum in quantum electrodynamics that had stumped giants of physics such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/feynman\" title=\"\">Richard Feynman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/08/guardianobituaries.nuclear\" title=\"\">Hans Bethe</a>. As an author, guru and apostle for science, Dyson also cheerfully proposed that humans might genetically engineer trees that could grow on comets, to provide new habitats for genetically altered humans.</p> <p>He had already proposed the ultimate solution to the energy crisis: a sufficiently advanced civilisation would, he argued, crunch up all the unused planets and asteroids to form a giant shell around its parent star, to reflect and exploit its radiation. Science fiction writers were delighted. The first suggestion became known as the Dyson tree. The second is called the Dyson sphere.</p> <p>He was born in Crowthorne, Berkshire. His father, George Dyson, was a musician and composer, and his mother, Mildred Atkey, a lawyer. The young Dyson reported that his happiest ever school holiday \u2013 from Winchester college \u2013 was spent working his way, from 6am to 10pm, through 700 problems in Piaggio\u2019s Differential Equations. \u201cI intended to speak the language of Einstein,\u201d he said in his 1979 memoir Disturbing the Universe. \u201cI was in love with mathematics and nothing else mattered.\u201d</p> <p>He graduated from Cambridge and in 1943 became a civilian scientist with <a href=\"https://www.rafbf.org/bomber-command-memorial/about-bomber-command\" title=\"\">RAF Bomber Command</a>, which experienced hideous losses with each raid over Germany. Dyson and his colleagues suggested that the Lancaster bomber\u2019s gun turrets slowed the plane, increased its burden and made it more vulnerable to German fighters: without the turrets, it might gain an extra 50mph and be much more manoeuvrable.</p> <p>He was ignored. Bomber Command, he was later to write, \u201cmight have been invented by a mad scientist as an example to exhibit as clearly as possible the evil aspects of science and technology: the Lancaster, in itself a magnificent flying machine, made into a death trap for the boys who flew it. A huge organisation dedicated to the purpose of burning cities and killing people, and doing it badly.\u201d</p> <p>The young Dyson was already convinced of some moral purpose to the universe and remained a non-denominational Christian all his life.</p> <p>After the second world war he went to Cornell University in New York state to begin research in physics under Bethe, one of the team at Los Alamos that fashioned the atomic bomb.</p> <p>By 1947, the challenge was one of pure science: to forge an accurate theory that described how atoms and electrons behaved when they absorbed or emitted light. The broad basis of what was called quantum electrodynamics had been proposed by the British scientist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/apr/02/paul-dirac-strangest-man-farmelo-quantum\" title=\"\">Paul Dirac</a> and other giants of physics. The next step was to calculate the precise behaviour inside an atom. Using different aproaches, both <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-julian-schwinger-1415566.html\" title=\"\">Julian Schwinger</a> and Feynman delivered convincing solutions, but their answers did not quite square with each other.</p> <p>It was while crossing Nebraska by bus, reading James Joyce and the biography of Pandit Nehru, that the young Dyson saw how to resolve the work of the two men and help win them the 1965 <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1965/summary/\" title=\"\">Nobel prize</a>: \u201cIt came bursting into my consciousness, like an explosion,\u201d Dyson wrote. \u201cI had no pencil and paper, but everything was so clear I did not need to write it down.\u201d</p> <p>A few days later he moved \u2013 for almost all of the rest of his life \u2013 to the <a href=\"https://www.ias.edu/press-releases/2020/freeman-j-dyson-1923%E2%80%932020\" title=\"\">Institute of Advanced Study</a> at Princeton, home of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alberteinstein\" title=\"\">Albert Einstein</a> and <a href=\"https://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/j-robert-oppenheimer\" title=\"\">Robert Oppenheimer</a>, the father of the atomic bomb. \u201cIt was exactly a year since I had left England to learn physics from the Americans. And now here I was a year later, walking down the road to the institute on a fine September morning, to teach the great Oppenheimer how to do physics.

      "bodyText": "The physicist Freeman Dyson, who has died aged 96, became famous within science for mathematical solutions so advanced that they could only be applied to complex problems of atomic theory and popular with the public for ideas so far-fetched they seemed beyond lunacy. As a young postgraduate student, Dyson devised \u2013 while taking a Greyhound bus ride in America \u2013 the answer to a conundrum in quantum electrodynamics that had stumped giants of physics such as Richard Feynman and Hans Bethe. As an author, guru and apostle for science, Dyson also cheerfully proposed that humans might genetically engineer trees that could grow on comets, to provide new habitats for genetically altered humans. He had already proposed the ultimate solution to the energy crisis: a sufficiently advanced civilisation would, he argued, crunch up all the unused planets and asteroids to form a giant shell around its parent star, to reflect and exploit its radiation. Science fiction writers were delighted. The first suggestion became known as the Dyson tree. The second is called the Dyson sphere. He was born in Crowthorne, Berkshire. His father, George Dyson, was a musician and composer, and his mother, Mildred Atkey, a lawyer. The young Dyson reported that his happiest ever school holiday \u2013 from Winchester college \u2013 was spent working his way, from 6am to 10pm, through 700 problems in Piaggio\u2019s Differential Equations. \u201cI intended to speak the language of Einstein,\u201d he said in his 1979 memoir Disturbing the Universe. \u201cI was in love with mathematics and nothing else mattered.\u201d He graduated from Cambridge and in 1943 became a civilian scientist with RAF Bomber Command, which experienced hideous losses with each raid over Germany. Dyson and his colleagues suggested that the Lancaster bomber\u2019s gun turrets slowed the plane, increased its burden and made it more vulnerable to German fighters: without the turrets, it might gain an extra 50mph and be much more manoeuvrable. He was ignored. Bomber Command, he was later to write, \u201cmight have been invented by a mad scientist as an example to exhibit as clearly as possible the evil aspects of science and technology: the Lancaster, in itself a magnificent flying machine, made into a death trap for the boys who flew it. A huge organisation dedicated to the purpose of burning cities and killing people, and doing it badly.\u201d The young Dyson was already convinced of some moral purpose to the universe and remained a non-denominational Christian all his life. After the second world war he went to Cornell University in New York state to begin research in physics under Bethe, one of the team at Los Alamos that fashioned the atomic bomb. By 1947, the challenge was one of pure science: to forge an accurate theory that described how atoms and electrons behaved when they absorbed or emitted light. The broad basis of what was called quantum electrodynamics had been proposed by the British scientist Paul Dirac and other giants of physics. The next step was to calculate the precise behaviour inside an atom. Using different aproaches, both Julian Schwinger and Feynman delivered convincing solutions, but their answers did not quite square with each other. It was while crossing Nebraska by bus, reading James Joyce and the biography of Pandit Nehru, that the young Dyson saw how to resolve the work of the two men and help win them the 1965 Nobel prize: \u201cIt came bursting into my consciousness, like an explosion,\u201d Dyson wrote. \u201cI had no pencil and paper, but everything was so clear I did not need to write it down.\u201d A few days later he moved \u2013 for almost all of the rest of his life \u2013 to the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, home of Albert Einstein and Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. \u201cIt was exactly a year since I had left England to learn physics from the Americans. And now here I was a year later, walking down the road to the institute on a fine September morning, to teach the great Oppenheimer how to do physics. The whole situation seemed too absurd to be credible,\u201d Dyson wrote later. He went on to deliver a series of papers that resolved the problems of quantum electrodynamics. He did not share in Feynman\u2019s and Schwinger\u2019s Nobel prize. He did not complain. \u201cI was not inventing new physics,\u201d he said. \u201cI merely clarified what was already there so that others could see the larger picture.\u201d Dyson tackled complex problems in theoretical physics and mathematics \u2013 there is a mathematical tool called the Dyson series, and another called Dyson\u2019s transform \u2013 and enjoyed the affection and respect of scientists everywhere. He took US citizenship, and worked on Project Orion, one of America\u2019s oddest and most ambitious space ventures. Orion was to be an enormous spacecraft, with a crew of 200 scientists and engineers, driven by nuclear weapons: warheads would be ejected one after another from the spaceship and detonated. This repeated pulse of blasts would generate speeds so colossal that the spacecraft could reach Mars in two weeks, and get to Saturn, explore the planet\u2019s moons, and get back to Earth again within seven months. Modern spacecraft launched by chemical rockets can take 12 months to reach Mars, and more than seven years to reach Saturn. The Orion project faltered under the burden of technical problems, and then was abandoned in 1965 after the partial test ban treaty that outlawed nuclear explosions in space. Dyson was a widely read man with a gift for memorable remarks and a great talent for presenting \u2013 with calm logic and bright language \u2013 ideas for which the term \u201coutside the envelope\u201d could only be the most feeble understatement. In 1960, in a paper for the journal Science, he argued that a technologically advanced civilisation would sooner or later surround its home star with reflective material to make full use of all its radiation. The extraterrestrials could do this by pulverising a planet the size of Jupiter, and spreading its fabric in a thin shell around their star, at twice the distance of the Earth from the sun.

Hangers-on Pete Buttigieg (Colin Jost) and Amy Klobuchar (Rachel Dratch) pop in just to snipe.</p> <p>For the most part, the sketch is as low-energy as Armisen\u2019s Bloomberg (as well as Jost\u2019s Buttigieg \u2013 if the former mayor of South Bend had any chance of sticking around much longer I\u2019d say they really need to get someone else to play him), flailing about while trying to catch up on two weeks of political news. That said, David and Mulaney are great, salvaging what they can.</p> <p>Mulaney, a former SNL writer and current comedy superstar, hosts for the third time. He apologizes to anyone who doesn\u2019t know who he is before jumping right into a new standup routine, covering topics such as baby boomer dads (\u201cAll of our dads are cramming for some world war two quiz show\u201d); politics (\u201cWhen I was a boy the United States was like Michael Jordan in 1992, and now the United States is like Michael Jordan now\u201d); and meeting a fan through the Make-a-Wish foundation.

His grotesquely swollen physique impresses his fellow cast members and even Lorne Michaels but not Mulaney, who promptly fires him.</p> <p>A new episode of the 50s soap Say, Those Two Don\u2019t Seem to Like Each Other sees rival sisters (Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant) once again vying for the affection of a visiting admiral.

Joe Biden (John Mulaney), fresh off a huge victory in \u201cSouth Cracker Barrell\u201d, rambles about \u201cChina cough\u201d, Nelson Mandela and Ebola monkeys, while Bernie Sanders (Larry David) starts out making a pitch for universal healthcare but ends up singing the praises of Joseph Stalin. Hangers-on Pete Buttigieg (Colin Jost) and Amy Klobuchar (Rachel Dratch) pop in just to snipe. For the most part, the sketch is as low-energy as Armisen\u2019s Bloomberg (as well as Jost\u2019s Buttigieg \u2013 if the former mayor of South Bend had any chance of sticking around much longer I\u2019d say they really need to get someone else to play him), flailing about while trying to catch up on two weeks of political news. That said, David and Mulaney are great, salvaging what they can. Mulaney, a former SNL writer and current comedy superstar, hosts for the third time. He apologizes to anyone who doesn\u2019t know who he is before jumping right into a new standup routine, covering topics such as baby boomer dads (\u201cAll of our dads are cramming for some world war two quiz show\u201d); politics (\u201cWhen I was a boy the United States was like Michael Jordan in 1992, and now the United States is like Michael Jordan now\u201d); and meeting a fan through the Make-a-Wish foundation. (\u201cLin-Manuel Miranda was my first choice!\u201d) He and Cecily Strong then play the romantic leads in The Sound of Music. Despite their chemistry, she\u2019s put off by the difference in their ages (she\u2019s 17 and he, despite riding a bike and living with his mother, is somewhere in his 40s) and his obvious Nazi sympathies. It\u2019s a solid musical sketch, albeit one that\u2019s likely to land better with those familiar with the film. Next, a suburban family gathering goes off the rails when Mulaney\u2019s middle-aged uncle accuses his college-aged nephew (Pete Davidson) of \u201cmemeing\u201d him by sharing a goofy picture across Reddit, where users add text such as \u201cWhen You Tip The Cam Girl 10K And She Block You\u201d, \u201cWhen Green Book On HBO\u201d and \u201cThat Feeling When You A Pedophile\u201d. No one is as good as Mulaney at playing befuddled white squares. Tired of being typecast as a loser nerd in sketches written by Mulaney, Kyle Mooney beefs up with the help of a nutritionist and fitness instructor (Justin Theroux, playing himself). His grotesquely swollen physique impresses his fellow cast members and even Lorne Michaels but not Mulaney, who promptly fires him. A new episode of the 50s soap Say, Those Two Don\u2019t Seem to Like Each Other sees rival sisters (Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant) once again vying for the affection of a visiting admiral. Last time, their efforts were thwarted by their sexy third sister (Jennifer Lopez) but this time it\u2019s their baby brother Julian (Mulaney), recently returned from the navy where he\u2019s earned a reputation as \u201cpass around party bottom\u201d that sends the admiral into a fit of lust. This bit is much improved from the last time, thanks mostly to Mulaney\u2019s oblivious twink. The night\u2019s musical guest is David Byrne. Alternately stumbling around the stage under a giant spotlight and being propped up by his dancing back-up band, he performs the Talking Heads classic Once in a Lifetime. It\u2019s a delightfully theatrical performance of the type for which Byrne is famous and SNL\u2019s most ambitious and interesting musical act in recent memory. On Weekend Update, Colin Jost voices his doubts over Donald Trump\u2019s ability to lead the nation through the coronavirus outbreak: \u201cHoping Trump can calm people down is like hoping cocaine can cure insomnia.\u201d Michael Che, worried that this could be it for all of us, breaks down and starts drinking on air while questioning his life choices. The hosts ought to try stuff like this more often, as it\u2019s a good change of pace. They\u2019re joined by Chris Redd, there to talk about how this Black History Month has been a bad one, what with the lack of black presidential candidates, boxer Deontay Wilder being literally \u201clicked while getting his ass beat\u201d by Tyson Fury, and the garish pictures from Trump\u2019s recent roundtable with African American supporters. They should have Redd on more often. A sequel to the popular Bodega Man musical number from Mulaney\u2019s last time hosting, Phantom of LaGuardia is a big, show-stopping Broadway extravaganza about New York\u2019s notoriously unpleasant \u201cthird world\u201d airport, including parodies of Phantom of the Opera, West Side Story, Annie and Wicked. Byrne and Jake Gyllenhaal, both of whom popped up in the recent Netflix special John Mulaney &amp; the Sack Lunch Bunch, lend their musical talents. It manages to actually eclipse Bodega Man, which is no small feat. Byrne and his troupe return, barefoot, to perform Toe Jam. Then the final sketch is Forgotten Figures of Black History, which covers Terrence Washington, the \u201cfirst black man to boo Jackie Robinson\u201d. It\u2019s a simple, funny premise but it can\u2019t hope to live up to the previous numbers. But then, nothing could. Much like fellow three-timer Adam Driver, Mulaney is as reliable a host as the show has these days, guaranteed to deliver a great monologue and at least one show-stopping sketch, raising the standard with his mere presence. Combined with Byrne\u2019s fabulous interludes, this episode stands alongside Driver and Eddie Murphy as the best of the season so far.",

      "body": "<p>Sitting at a table at an east London gay bar, American comedian Jaboukie Young-White is making some last-minute tweaks to his standup material. It\u2019s a Wednesday afternoon in November and later he\u2019ll appear onstage for a solo show at the Soho Theatre. This is his first time in the UK; the first time he\u2019ll perform outside North America. And while his act is well-rehearsed for audiences at home, he\u2019s determined to make sure it translates. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t have Popeyes here, right?\u201d he asks, referring to the American fried-chicken chain. \u201cBut you have these things called Tories?\u201d</p> <p>Young-White is 25. Last year, the <em>New York Times</em> described him as \u201ca comic prodigy with a veteran\u2019s killer moves\u201d, and various American magazines, including <em>Rolling Stone</em> and <em>Variety</em>, have labelled him a \u201ccomic to watch\u201d. Over the past five years he has amassed a substantial online following by sharing memes, shitposts, and quickfire political and social commentary \u2013 a kind of comic stream of consciousness. As is the way in modern comedy, that following has translated into IRL jobs writing for television. In 2018 he was hired by the <em>Daily Show </em>with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/13/trevor-noah-on-satires-uphill-battle-in-the-age-of-trump-the-daily-show\" title=\"\">Trevor Noah</a> \u2013 a prestigious, high-profile gig for which he mostly delivers skits on politics as the show\u2019s \u201cSenior Youth Correspondent\u201d. (\u201cWhy do we still use paper to vote?\u201d Young-White asked in his first appearance on the show, addressing poor turnout figures among the young. \u201cPaper is over!\u201d) He later recorded a half-hour solo show for Comedy Central in which he recalled getting distracted by a statue during a sex-education lesson and lusting after a topless Jesus looking \u201ccute as fuck on the cross\u201d.</p> <p>For many, Young-White represents a new generation of US comics: he is black, queer, non-apologetic and huge on social media. Often his jokes zero in on gender, race, sex and sexuality, but, in the millennial way, they do so without taking aim at minorities \u2013 without making his community the punchline. His bits aren\u2019t jokes about, say, gay people for the enjoyment of others; they are jokes for gay people who happen to be watching mainstream TV.</p> <p>\u201cYou used to have to take the piss out of yourself just to be able to perform,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s something I was always reluctant to get into. Sometimes I <em>do</em> just want to send up the gays. But it can be tricky. You have to ask: who is this for? Who\u2019s going to be consuming this?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b3edf99ce86999bc7a2c328b0cccc9488e5f0f8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3edf99ce86999bc7a2c328b0cccc9488e5f0f8b/0_1758_4912_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaboukie Young-White leaning on a mic in front of glittery silver stage curtains\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You used to have to take the piss out of yourself to be able to perform. That\u2019s something I was reluctant to get into\u2019: Jaboukie Young-White.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Chalkley/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take a report he made for the <em>Daily Show </em>at Pittsburgh\u2019s Pride festival last summer. Wearing rainbow-coloured Speedos, he explored the politics of the city\u2019s queer celebration and came away with a segment that explored the topic of pink-washing \u2013 the tumultuous relationships between corporate sponsors and Pride events \u2013 a subject that is generally confined to conversations within the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cEQT doesn\u2019t just shoot hot liquid deep into holes in the ground,\u201d he said of the fracking company-cum-Pride sponsor. \u201cThey also swing both ways by supporting pride <em>and</em> various anti-gay politicians.\u201d</p> <p>Young-White\u2019s comedy isn\u2019t standard mainstream fare. \u201cOne thing I found interesting was that, by doing late-night TV, I was being put in front of people who aren\u2019t used to seeing something in mainstream culture that wasn\u2019t <em>for</em> them,\u201d he says. \u201cI grew up being so familiar with that feeling. So much shit wasn\u2019t for me, so I\u2019d just go elsewhere. But I find that for a lot of people that feeling is very foreign.\u201d He thinks that young comics like him have had to disabuse themselves of the idea that they have to appeal to everyone, as older comics once had to. \u201cI know I have my audience,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s them I\u2019m here for.\u201d</p> <p>Pint in hand, Young-White is in full swing now, venting about the brigade of comedians, usually older, who think \u201cPC culture\u201d has gone too far. These people aren\u2019t freedom fighters, he says. They\u2019re upset because their particular brand of comedy, which gets laughs at the expense of others, has all of a sudden become less profitable. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing everyone should understand,\u201d he says. \u201cThese people aren\u2019t Rosa Parks on the bus. They are millionaires who want money. The nobility of it needs to be deflated immediately. Some comedians were built for the monoculture. They thrived when everyone was watching the same things, doing the same things. Culture is fragmented now. And they can\u2019t handle the idea that not everyone likes them. And that, in the digital age, people can actually talk back to them.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A good joke will make you think, but it won\u2019t change who you are</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Young-White was raised in Harvey, Illinois, by Jamaican immigrants. Like many comedians growing up, he thought of himself as something of an outsider. He was sent to white Catholic schools, for instance, while living in a predominantly black neighbourhood. \u201cI know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 of mixed people,\u201d he says. \u201cThe tragic mulatto archetype. But that was my experience. At school I was bullied for being black and in my neighbourhood for being white.\u201d</p> <p>Experiences like this made Young-White perceptive. He learned quickly that what might feel extremely normal in one place is not normal somewhere else. He began to think comedically about those differences, aware of the absurdities and intricacies of the different communities in which he spent time.</p> <p>Because he lived a distance from his classmates, Young-White relied on social media to keep in contact with them, and began to chase the dopamine hits that come with getting \u201clikes\u201d. \u201cI started to post really bad jokes on Facebook,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019d message my friends saying, \u2018Yo, go like my status on Facebook, I just posted a new joke.\u2019\u201d He\u2019s laughing now. \u201cI was so fucking obnoxious. They used to call me a Facebook slut in high school. Like, people <em>hated</em> me.\u201d</p> <p>At 17, he auditioned for a part in a class production of <em>Miracle Worker </em>\u2013 a play about the life of deaf-blind American writer and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2018/jun/01/helen-keller-deaf-blind-and-mighty-video\" title=\"\">Helen Keller</a> \u2013 to give being a \u201ctheatre kid\u201d a try, and landed the role of the protagonist\u2019s brother.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this one scene right before the interval where Keller is trying to learn how to eat at the dinner table and she keeps throwing the fork and smashing plates and shit like that,\u201d he says, grinning. On opening night, one student actor went too hard and broke a chair on stage. Cast and audience began to freak out, unsure how to respond. It\u2019s hardly fertile ground for comedic inspiration, but Young-White spotted an opportunity. He told everyone backstage he had a plan, then walked on to the set to survey the damage. Looking at the wreckage, he hammily gasped, \u201cOh no, my favourite chair!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a five-minute laugh break,\u201d he says. \u201cThe audience died, everyone on stage broke, nobody could stop laughing.\u201d The drama teacher was forced to cut to black. \u201cIt was so fucking stupid,\u201d Young-White says. \u201cBut in that moment I knew I had to chase that feeling. The director yelled at me, saying I had made the show about me instead of Helen Keller. I just smiled and said it was very in character, very in the moment. I wasn\u2019t sorry at all.\u201d</p> <p>When he graduated, Young-White thought film school might be a good fit for his talents, but it was expensive, and a writing course at Chicago\u2019s Second City school of improvisation was so pricey it felt like a scam. \u201cThat was for finance bros and rich kids,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would I pay $600 to have someone teach me how to be funny?\u201d So he turned his hand to standup, a \u201cmore egalitarian\u201d way of getting his ideas out in the world.</p> <p>Slowly, he climbed Chicago\u2019s standup ranks. He performed at open mics across the city, then graduated to five-, 10- and 15-minute billings. He moved to New York City, where he now lives, as soon as he began to consistently bank 30-minute slots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8db738bd50bbf818e0b263b8ce44e6e5c11753e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8db738bd50bbf818e0b263b8ce44e6e5c11753e2/0_144_4334_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaboukie Young-White with Trevor Noah on the Daily Show\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018By doing late-night TV, I was being put in front of people who aren\u2019t used to seeing something that wasn\u2019t for them\u2019: with the Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Young-White has his brother Javaughn to thank for his burgeoning career. Three years ago Javaughn posted a bunch of Young-White\u2019s Instagram posts to Twitter. BuzzFeed interviewed him after the posts went viral. \u201cThat truly was the beginning of my career,\u201d he says. \u201cI got, like, 25,000 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jaboukie/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> followers. And all I was trying to do was annoy my friends.\u201d</p> <p>But being funny and famous in the digital world is not free of its own specific challenges. He is aware that members of his own generation often scroll through joke after joke online, which can make an audience desensitised. When the amount of humour being consumed is at unprecedented levels, writing material that makes a mark takes more thought than ever before. There\u2019s also the risk that, on platforms like Twitter, jokes get stolen. \u201cEvery month, someone with a big account will post [one of my jokes] as their own. I\u2019ve done it in sets before and people afterwards have said they\u2019ve heard it before. I\u2019m like, \u2018Yes! Because it\u2019s my fucking tweet!\u2019\u201d Still, he appreciates the way spending time on social media informs his work. If tweets don\u2019t get traction, he knows the joke will need rehashing.</p> <p>Young-White has a unique audience. A lot of people who find him online and come to a show might never have been to one before. \u201cThat\u2019s a really exciting place to be in,\u201d he says. \u201cI can do a lot of shit and they won\u2019t think it\u2019s weird as they\u2019ll have never seen standup before.\u201d As much as he can, he brings the energy he shows online to his standup shows, using screengrabs of tweets and PowerPoints. He respects the power of social media, he says, as well as that of the more traditional one-person-and-a-mic comedy, and loves bridging the gap between the two.</p> <p>Comedy is important in the way it creates communities that are visceral and immediate, Young-White says. Getting a room of people all experiencing the same thing and laughing at the same time is \u201cgorgeous\u201d. But he knows that, at the end of the day, it\u2019s <em>just</em> comedy. It\u2019s not going to change the world, no matter what some comedians might think.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re products of our environments,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that is so entrenched in what makes us who we are that a five-minute comedy set isn\u2019t going to change it. A joke might make you think about things a little differently, but it won\u2019t change who you are. That gives comedy too much credit.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Young-White is very much a Bernie Sanders supporter. (In a recent Instagram selfie, he posed in front of a mirror, completely naked except for the word \u201cLit\u201d covering his genitalia, and tagged it <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B7_2bejngsG/?hl=en\" title=\"\">#hotboysforbernie</a>.) And much of his comedy remains political, too. But before the 2016 presidential election he wanted all his comedy to be incisive and cutting \u2013 the sort that speaks truth to power, but since Trump entered the White House, that has changed. Creating effective satire is much harder now, he says, because \u201cwe\u2019ve been taken to absurd extremes already\u201d.</p> <p>But it\u2019s more than that. Young-White now wants to offer an escape from bad news \u2013 to make people laugh at things he calls stupid and fun. \u201cWe have to have moments of transcendence,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere we get to just shut our brains off. Right now I think that\u2019s what feels most subversive. We\u2019re so plugged in, so informed and aware of injustices that any moment we can get to just be our unfiltered, dumb, pure selves and get excited about something totally meaningless\u2026 They\u2019re the most beautiful.\u201d</p> <p><em>Jaboukie Young-White is a correspondent on <a href=\"http://www.cc.com/shows/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah\" title=\"\">The Daily Show</a> with Trevor Noah</em></p>",

Wearing rainbow-coloured Speedos, he explored the politics of the city\u2019s queer celebration and came away with a segment that explored the topic of pink-washing \u2013 the tumultuous relationships between corporate sponsors and Pride events \u2013 a subject that is generally confined to conversations within the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cEQT doesn\u2019t just shoot hot liquid deep into holes in the ground,\u201d he said of the fracking company-cum-Pride sponsor. \u201cThey also swing both ways by supporting pride and various anti-gay politicians.\u201d Young-White\u2019s comedy isn\u2019t standard mainstream fare. \u201cOne thing I found interesting was that, by doing late-night TV, I was being put in front of people who aren\u2019t used to seeing something in mainstream culture that wasn\u2019t for them,\u201d he says. \u201cI grew up being so familiar with that feeling. So much shit wasn\u2019t for me, so I\u2019d just go elsewhere. But I find that for a lot of people that feeling is very foreign.\u201d He thinks that young comics like him have had to disabuse themselves of the idea that they have to appeal to everyone, as older comics once had to. \u201cI know I have my audience,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s them I\u2019m here for.\u201d Pint in hand, Young-White is in full swing now, venting about the brigade of comedians, usually older, who think \u201cPC culture\u201d has gone too far. These people aren\u2019t freedom fighters, he says. They\u2019re upset because their particular brand of comedy, which gets laughs at the expense of others, has all of a sudden become less profitable. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing everyone should understand,\u201d he says. \u201cThese people aren\u2019t Rosa Parks on the bus. They are millionaires who want money. The nobility of it needs to be deflated immediately. Some comedians were built for the monoculture. They thrived when everyone was watching the same things, doing the same things. Culture is fragmented now. And they can\u2019t handle the idea that not everyone likes them. And that, in the digital age, people can actually talk back to them.\u201d Young-White was raised in Harvey, Illinois, by Jamaican immigrants. Like many comedians growing up, he thought of himself as something of an outsider. He was sent to white Catholic schools, for instance, while living in a predominantly black neighbourhood. \u201cI know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 of mixed people,\u201d he says. \u201cThe tragic mulatto archetype. But that was my experience. At school I was bullied for being black and in my neighbourhood for being white.\u201d Experiences like this made Young-White perceptive. He learned quickly that what might feel extremely normal in one place is not normal somewhere else. He began to think comedically about those differences, aware of the absurdities and intricacies of the different communities in which he spent time. Because he lived a distance from his classmates, Young-White relied on social media to keep in contact with them, and began to chase the dopamine hits that come with getting \u201clikes\u201d. \u201cI started to post really bad jokes on Facebook,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019d message my friends saying, \u2018Yo, go like my status on Facebook, I just posted a new joke.\u2019\u201d He\u2019s laughing now. \u201cI was so fucking obnoxious. They used to call me a Facebook slut in high school. Like, people hated me.\u201d At 17, he auditioned for a part in a class production of Miracle Worker \u2013 a play about the life of deaf-blind American writer and activist Helen Keller \u2013 to give being a \u201ctheatre kid\u201d a try, and landed the role of the protagonist\u2019s brother. \u201cThere\u2019s this one scene right before the interval where Keller is trying to learn how to eat at the dinner table and she keeps throwing the fork and smashing plates and shit like that,\u201d he says, grinning. On opening night, one student actor went too hard and broke a chair on stage. Cast and audience began to freak out, unsure how to respond. It\u2019s hardly fertile ground for comedic inspiration, but Young-White spotted an opportunity. He told everyone backstage he had a plan, then walked on to the set to survey the damage. Looking at the wreckage, he hammily gasped, \u201cOh no, my favourite chair!\u201d \u201cIt was a five-minute laugh break,\u201d he says. \u201cThe audience died, everyone on stage broke, nobody could stop laughing.\u201d The drama teacher was forced to cut to black. \u201cIt was so fucking stupid,\u201d Young-White says. \u201cBut in that moment I knew I had to chase that feeling. The director yelled at me, saying I had made the show about me instead of Helen Keller. I just smiled and said it was very in character, very in the moment. I wasn\u2019t sorry at all.\u201d When he graduated, Young-White thought film school might be a good fit for his talents, but it was expensive, and a writing course at Chicago\u2019s Second City school of improvisation was so pricey it felt like a scam. \u201cThat was for finance bros and rich kids,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would I pay $600 to have someone teach me how to be funny?\u201d So he turned his hand to standup, a \u201cmore egalitarian\u201d way of getting his ideas out in the world. Slowly, he climbed Chicago\u2019s standup ranks. He performed at open mics across the city, then graduated to five-, 10- and 15-minute billings. He moved to New York City, where he now lives, as soon as he began to consistently bank 30-minute slots. But Young-White has his brother Javaughn to thank for his burgeoning career. Three years ago Javaughn posted a bunch of Young-White\u2019s Instagram posts to Twitter. BuzzFeed interviewed him after the posts went viral. \u201cThat truly was the beginning of my career,\u201d he says. \u201cI got, like, 25,000 Instagram followers. And all I was trying to do was annoy my friends.\u201d But being funny and famous in the digital world is not free of its own specific challenges. He is aware that members of his own generation often scroll through joke after joke online, which can make an audience desensitised. When the amount of humour being consumed is at unprecedented levels, writing material that makes a mark takes more thought than ever before. There\u2019s also the risk that, on platforms like Twitter, jokes get stolen. \u201cEvery month, someone with a big account will post [one of my jokes] as their own. I\u2019ve done it in sets before and people afterwards have said they\u2019ve heard it before. I\u2019m like, \u2018Yes! Because it\u2019s my fucking tweet!\u2019\u201d Still, he appreciates the way spending time on social media informs his work. If tweets don\u2019t get traction, he knows the joke will need rehashing. Young-White has a unique audience. A lot of people who find him online and come to a show might never have been to one before. \u201cThat\u2019s a really exciting place to be in,\u201d he says. \u201cI can do a lot of shit and they won\u2019t think it\u2019s weird as they\u2019ll have never seen standup before.\u201d As much as he can, he brings the energy he shows online to his standup shows, using screengrabs of tweets and PowerPoints. He respects the power of social media, he says, as well as that of the more traditional one-person-and-a-mic comedy, and loves bridging the gap between the two. Comedy is important in the way it creates communities that are visceral and immediate, Young-White says. Getting a room of people all experiencing the same thing and laughing at the same time is \u201cgorgeous\u201d. But he knows that, at the end of the day, it\u2019s just comedy. It\u2019s not going to change the world, no matter what some comedians might think. \u201cWe\u2019re products of our environments,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that is so entrenched in what makes us who we are that a five-minute comedy set isn\u2019t going to change it. A joke might make you think about things a little differently, but it won\u2019t change who you are. That gives comedy too much credit.\u201d Still, Young-White is very much a Bernie Sanders supporter. (In a recent Instagram selfie, he posed in front of a mirror, completely naked except for the word \u201cLit\u201d covering his genitalia, and tagged it #hotboysforbernie.) And much of his comedy remains political, too. But before the 2016 presidential election he wanted all his comedy to be incisive and cutting \u2013 the sort that speaks truth to power, but since Trump entered the White House, that has changed. Creating effective satire is much harder now, he says, because \u201cwe\u2019ve been taken to absurd extremes already\u201d. But it\u2019s more than that. Young-White now wants to offer an escape from bad news \u2013 to make people laugh at things he calls stupid and fun. \u201cWe have to have moments of transcendence,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere we get to just shut our brains off. Right now I think that\u2019s what feels most subversive. We\u2019re so plugged in, so informed and aware of injustices that any moment we can get to just be our unfiltered, dumb, pure selves and get excited about something totally meaningless\u2026 They\u2019re the most beautiful.\u201d Jaboukie Young-White is a correspondent on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah",

      "bodyText": "Which means we\u2019re just about done \u2013 thanks for your company, and enjoy the rest of your weekend. Ta-ra. Here\u2019s Raf Nicholson\u2019s match report. Twenty-one, world cup dayboo, wicket in your first over. Not bad. This, I\u2019m afraid, was the point at which this match was decided. On the other hand, in Knight and Sciver they\u2019ve got two batters in form with the temperament to deliver, and I\u2019d expect Anya Shrubsole to grow into things from here. I wonder what the pitch will be like at the G, where the final will be played. I\u2019d expect something a bit less sticky than we saw today, which is another reason I find it hard to see England winning the thing. I\u2019ll tell you something about this world cup: I\u2019ve not a clue who\u2019s going to win it. I imagine that we\u2019d all be fairly surprised if it weren\u2019t Australia-India in the final, but I\u2019d disbelieve anyone who felt certain about how that might turn out. England\u2019s big advantage is the variety in their bowling and, on slower tracks, the number of bowlers they have who can make things even slower. I\u2019d worry about them on a flat deck and they\u2019re far from favourites, but on a good day they\u2019re a hard night for anyone. That Australia-New Zealand match is tomorrow. It would be a gigantic shock if the hosts went out, but it\u2019s absolutely possible. The winners will meet South Africa in the semi on Thursday night, while England will face India on Thursday afternoon. Both matches should be brilliant. Heather Knight says she\u2019s really happy with how clever her team were in keeping it simple and keeping the score ticking. She goes on to say that in tournament cricket you need to change things quickly so they moved Amy Jones down because she wasn\u2019t scoring and is pleased it came off, though Tammy Beaumont did not. She also praises Mady Villiers, her team who\u2019ve been \u201cplaying knockout cricket since the second game\u201d and won\u2019t say who she wants to win of Australia or New Zealand. I think we can guess, but. No Stafanie Taylor, so Anisa Mohammed steps in. She says Taylor is in a lot of pain, and losing her was huge in the game. She\u2019s happy with the energy her team showed in the field, but they needed to bowl a little straighter in the last five overs, when England got away. She accepts that her team allowed too many dots, and keeping the score ticking is something at which they need to work. Nasser Hussain \u2013 least said about his beige trainers the better - is with Nat Sciver, the player of the match. She says she\u2019s in nick and is enjoying her time in the middle, also noting the wicket was slow, so England reckoned that if they ran well and had a batter in the middle at the end, they\u2019d be set. She praises Wyatt\u2019s running, and tells us watching the previous game showed her how to bat and what sort of score was decent. She is very, very good. That\u2019s a very good evening\u2019s work from England, who won the toss, got their team right, their order right, and found something every time they needed something. They\u2019ll need to play better to beat whoever comes next, but the batting was good enough and the bowling was strong. WICKET! Mohammed b Ecclestone 5 (West Indies 97 all out) Ecclestone befuddled Mohammed in the flight; the batsmen is lost in supermarket, unable to settle upon a course of action, and a belated sweep isn\u2019t where it\u2019s at, the ball clipping off stump. 17th over: West Indies 97-8 (Mohammed 5, Selman 0) Target 144 Mohammed nails four through cover; this will be so frustrating for the West Indians, because their boundary-hitting has been good enough to compete. A single follows. Mohammad sweeps to fine leg and sets off bu the call is nice and early, Glenn hurling past the strikers\u2019 to the bowlers\u2019 where Villiers again does the rest. Taylor won\u2019t be returning, so England are a wicket away. Fletcher bunts to cover and sets off, but she\u2019s never making it and a throw to the bowlers\u2019 is enough to see her away. 17th over: West Indies 92-6 (Alleyne 10, Fletcher 0) Target 144 Villers opens her final over with three wides as Jones misses down the leg side, then Alleyne stretches down on one knee to bang another one-bounce four down the sides. West Indies now have nine fours and two sixes; the problem is that they\u2019ve also faced 92 dots, and 59 of the first hundred balls were dots. That\u2019s the difference here. 16th over: West Indies 84-6 (Alleyne 5, Fletcher 0) Target 144 This has been excellent from England, but that injury to Stafanie Taylor killed this game just as it was getting going. Cooper has a humungous hoik, misses, andJones has the bails off in a trice. But Cooper was so far down she could\u2019ve done all sorts in between. 16th over: West Indies 84-5 (Cooper 15, Alleyne 5) Target 144 Ecclestone returns and her first ball is on the pads, easily turned behind for four by Alleyene. 15th over: West Indies 79-5 (Cooper 15, Alleyne 1) Target 144 Lovely from Cooper, waiting for Shrubsole and using her pace, opening the face to glide four through third man. A wide and a dot follow, then Cooper picks one up and then some, down on one knee to turn length ball into a half-volley, carting a one-bounce four over deep backward square. A single comes next, then another, and West Indies are coming back well here, problem being they need 65 from 30 to win. The return of the gun does the trick for England, Kirby stretching down the track to kitchen-sink a pull, but a top edge picks out Sciver at mid on and this time she hangs on. 14th over: West Indies 68-4 (Cooper 6, Kirby 20) Target 144 Three singles off Villiers - Cooper won\u2019t have enjoyed them - so Kirby goes big and here\u2019s Brunt running along the fence. She looks to claim nonchalantly, oh so nonchalantly, to be left inspecing her hands for holes, and the ball goes through them and over the fence for another six, then backed up by a single. Ten from the over. 13th over: West Indies 58-4 (Cooper 4, Kirby 12) Target 144 England will be really happy with how they\u2019ve played today, and what\u2019s this? Cooper looks to go over on an ankle running a single; it never rains, but sometimes it pours so hard it makes your head bleed. In the meantime, Kirby comes down the track to absolutely mass-murder Glenn over long on for six! Then she goes again, a leading edge sending one into orbit ... and the infallible Sciver scells it! A single follows and that\u2019s the end of Glenn, who returns figures of 2-16 off her four overs. 12th over: West Indies 42-4 (Cooper 2, Kirby 5) Target 144 Villiers continues, and the batsmen need to make a decision: do they try and avoid embarrassment, just batting to lose anyway, or do they try and win because you never know? After a single to Cooper, Kirby lashes a wide one for four through cover, and two further singles follow. hat\u2019s West Indies\u2019 best over in quite some time, but they need 95 from 48 balls. Good luck with that one. 11th over: West Indies 42-4 (Cooper 0, Kirby 0) Target 144 Kirby tries a mow and the ball loops up, away from Jones, luckily for her, and that\u2019s another wicket maiden. There\u2019ve been so many dots in this innings. Yup, that brushed the gloves, and that\u2019s three wickets plus a retired hurt in 14 balls. West Indies are, in the parlance of our times, done. 11th over: West Indies 42-3 (Nation 0, Cooper 0) Target 144 Glenn comes in again and Nation makes room to cut one that goes straight on, missing ... there\u2019s appeal for caught behind, nothing doing, and England review! 10th over: West Indies 42-3 (Nation 0, Cooper 0) Target 144 Easy, this world cup jazz. Villiers, 21 years old, starts with a wicket made. As Ryan Giggs would say, she\u2019d\u2019ve took it. I probably would\u2019ve done too. Campbelle comes down the pitch seeking to force the issue but can only punch into the air, and Villiers takes a smart return catch, leaning over a ducking Nation. When it goes it goes quick! 10th over: West Indies 42-2 (Campbelle 1, Nation 0) Target 144 England use their sixth bowler, Knight chucking Mady Villiers the ball for her dayboo World Cup over. She opens with three dots... 9th over: West Indies 42-2 (Campbelle 1, Nation 0) Target 144 That\u2019s a huge over for England, and huge little passage. One run from it, one wicket, and I can\u2019t see a way for West Indies from here. The ball didn\u2019t straighten enough, and West Indies are still in this ... just. I\u2019m not sure that was hitting and nor are the batsmen! When it does it goes quick! Glenn sends down a straight one that deviates off the pitch and into the pad! The bat is nowhere near it, but it is hitting? It\u2019s all falling apart now. Glenn tosses one up and Matthews plays an airy swipe. She misses, and there\u2019s the death rattle. 9th over: West Indies 42-1 (Matthews 10, Campbelle 1) Target 144 Pressure. West Indies need to get going again quicksmart, and Campbelle takes a single from her first ball. I hate to say it, but that might just be the match. West Indies were going nicely, and losing their captain at this point will be very hard to take. Who else will stand up? 8th over: West Indies 41-1 (Matthews 10, Taylor 15) Target 144 Both teams will know that this is the partnership, and Sciver looks to break it but will take another cheap over. West Indies really need to get the soft hands going for when they can\u2019t force a boundary and this is a decent enough over for them, a single to Matthews, two leg byes, and then Taylor absolutely zetzing to midwicket ... where she\u2019s dropped! That would\u2019ve been a monumental take, given how hard it was hit, but what\u2019s this? Oh no! Taylor takes a single but can barely complete the run! She looks to have torn her groin playing the previous mow, and the stretcher is on! That is such a shame, and they can barely get her onto it. i can\u2019t see her playing again this competition. 7th over: West Indies 35-1 (Matthews 9, Taylor 12) Target 144 Glenn comes on to skip through some off-breaks and Matthews has a look, taking a single from the second one, then a leg bye follows and, under pressure to score, Matthews finds her release, stepping right back in the crease to drive hard to the cover fence! She celebrates in her follow-through; she needed that, and the chase is oan. 6th over: West Indies 28-1 (Matthews 3, Taylor 12) Target 144 Taylor will need to do something serious here, and she forces Brunt from under the tootsies to backward square; they run two. Two more follow when the bowler strays straight, turned behind square on the leg side, and a wide then yields a stumping review! But Taylor, though she was on the ball and wavering, is fine, and doesn\u2019t she make the most of it, absolutely shmicing a one-bounce four over long on ... and creaming a square drive through cover! What an end to the powerplay! 5th over: West Indies 15-1 (Matthews 3, Taylor 0) Target 144 Eeeesh! Matthews comes down to Ecclestone and tries to hit her into the future but misses by plenty and they run a bye. Already, this is a troubling situation for West Indies; 21 of their first 29 balls have been dots, and a leg bye is all they can add, Taylor just grounding her bat in time, but should take the ensuing review as a warning. 4th over: West Indies 13-1 (Matthews 3, Taylor 0) Target 144 When England weren\u2019t hitting boundaries they did a really good job of keeping the scoreboard ticking while RO-tating strike. West Indies need to do that, because the bad balls will come; the question is whether West Indies are in position to take advantage. Well, many more overs like this and they won\u2019t be, Sciver coming on and ceding just a single, pulled by Matthews to the leg-side sweeper. NO SHE CANNOT STAY PATIENT! NO SHE CANNOT! Dottin tries to lug from outside off to leg, falling away in the process, and picks out the fielder! 3rd over: West Indies 12-0 (Matthews 2, Dottin 9) Target 144 Ecclestone has the ball and will look to bowl her left-armers wicket to wicket, restricting pace and width; can Dottin stay patient, while keeping the score ticking? This is a good over for England, three singles and a wide from it and Wyatt saving four with a great diving stop. 2nd over: West Indies 9-0 (Matthews 1, Dottin 8) Target 144 Brunt has the ball from the other end and Jones opts to stand back to begin with. Her first three ball are dots, but then Dottin imposes her capital letter, cracking a short, wide one for four through the covers. She picked the length of that so quickly, and chucked her hands right through it, then followed it up with two and one into the leg side; that\u2019s an excellent over for West Indies, who will feel like the chase is now on. 1st over: West Indies 2-0 (Matthews 1, Dottin 1) Target 144 The more I think about Shrubsole and Brunt, the more I fancy England; what an absolute pair they are. After three dots, Matthews panics and sets off on a Red Bull single; a direct hit, or even a throw into the gloves, the keeper, and that is the height of gawn, but Beaumont is wild. Dottin, opening to give some early gas, then gets off the mark with an inside edge; they run one more. Shrubsole has the ball and here we go! England will be happy they picked the extra spinner; forcing boundaries on this track is difficult. West Indies need to decide whether to hang in there early and go large at the end or look to get ahead of the game from the start. My guess is they\u2019ll pursue the latter. So England need to win to reach the semis; West Indies need to win, then either beat South Africa or lose while sorting a net run-rate that\u2019s better than England\u2019s. It\u2019s a lot to ask. Though England moving Beaumont up didn\u2019t work, moving Amy Jones down absolutely did; her 23 off 13 and Brunt\u2019s 10 off four lifted England from an acceptable total towards a commanding one. A decent performance from West Indies won\u2019t be enough here, but as we said up front, one knock from one player can be enough. England will be very happy with that. They set it up well, Sciver and Knight working the ball around, then forced the issue at the end and will back their attack to do the necessary. West Indies, though, absolutely have the firepower to win here; what I\u2019m saying is, we\u2019ve got a potential classic on our hands. 20th over: England 143-5 (Jones 23, Brunt 10) Jones forces to midwicket and they look for two, but Cooper wings in a screaming throw ... and off come the bails! But what\u2019s this? A dive! Jones is safe, and teaches her captain a lesson in the process. A single follows, then Brunt takes two to long on before skipping down and personalitying four under deep midwicket\u2019s drive! And have a look! Brunt stretches down the pitch and turns Selman\u2019s final ball into a full toss, hammering four through cover! That\u2019s brilliant last over for England, 13 from it, and it\u2019ll take a monumental effort from West Indies to chase that on this pitch. 19th over: England 130-5 (Jones 20, Brunt 0) Here we go with the final over... Sciver looks to hit over midwicket but picks it out instead! Still, she\u2019s constructed another beautiful innings in difficult circumstances. 19th over: England 130-4 (Sciver 57, Jones 20) Here we go, a dot from Taylor then two to Jones and here we go! First, she eases four through backward point, then she chases a wide one to crack a filthy delivery through point and to the fence! The switch in the order wasn\u2019t just to get Beaumont to the top of the order, it was to get her to the middle. 18th over: England 119-4 (Sciver 57, Jones 9) Fletcher continues and Sciver takes a big step down the ground to cart her first ball over the top for four down to long off. here she goes! A single to cover follows, then Jones does brilliantly to force one from outside off which bisects long on and midwicket ad rushes through for four more. Fletcher comes back really well, her final three deliveries yielding just three singles, but England will be happy enough with this; they\u2019ll want another 20 from the remaining two overs, but what they already have is defendable. 17th over: England 107-4 (Sciver 51, Jones 3) Sciver eases two to third man \u2013 she\u2019s in such command of her game \u2013 and after as dot, cracks towards mid on \u2013 Matthews dives, Ramprakash-style, but can\u2019t quite complete a brilliant effort so that\u2019s Sciver\u2019s fourth 50 in six innings. What a player! 16th over: England 102-4 (Sciver 47, Jones 2) So here comes the other half of England\u2019s gamble, Amy Jones looking for death runs. After Sciver takes a two and a one, she adds two of her own through midwicket. \u201cOff-red? Is this a Handmaid\u2019s Tale reference?\u201d yuks Ravi Nair. \u201cMy usual colour is sallow, with purple panting highlights. Goes just as well, or badly, with anything.\u201d The OBO expects nothing less nor nothing more. England look to move it on, and fail! Wilson gets reasonable hold of a straight one \u2013 either side of Cooper and it\u2019s four \u2013 but it\u2019s down her throat at midwicket, and she holds on! That\u2019s really good bowling too, straight enough to force the batsmen to force the issue. We\u2019re going to have an arse-nipper, but the looks of things. 16th over: England 97-3 (Sciver 44, Wilson 3) Fletcher returns to the attack and goes for two singles from her first two balls. 15th over: England 95-3 (Sciver 43, Wilson 2) Selman returns and Sciver forces one down the ground; three more follow. The question now is whether England accept a score of 120-130, or look to push towards 140-150, which would put them in a great position. \u201cWon\u2019t be the first or last person to say this,\u201d emails Abhijato Sensarma,\u201d but just wanted it to be out there - Nat Sciver is a gem\u201d. I couldn\u2019t agree more. There\u2019s so much to like about this England team \u2013 the way they play and the way they compete \u2013 and she\u2019s a huge part of that. And this is a proper expert\u2019s knock. 14th over: England 91-3 (Sciver 41, Wilson 0) West Indies needed that; a couple of tight overs now and suddenly they\u2019re favourites. Oh dear oh dear! Knight miscues to midwicket and as they steal a single she doesn\u2019t sprint or dive! Selman shies, hits, and that is so, so lax! What a giveaway! But West Indies have fielded really well and it\u2019s earned them a colossal wicket. 14th over: England 90-2 (Sciver 40, Knight 17) West Indies bring midwicket into a catching position, so Sciver simply chips over her head for four; that\u2019s beautifully done! A slog-sweep then adds two more, and this is exhibition stuff at the moment, calm accumulation from both batsmen, complete in control of the situation. But have a look! 13th over: England 83-2 (Sciver 33, Knight 17) Sciver takes a single then Knight cracks to to midwicket and two more to square leg; she looks so controlled out there, all her moving parts working cohesively. The batsmen swap singles and then Knight sees Mohammed coming, coming down the track so quickly to set and drive through cover. England are ticking, 11 from the over. 12th over: England 72-2 (Sciver 31, Knight 8) Matthews returns to the attack as England continue setting it up and setting up like a jungle tune; when are we getting the drop? Five singles from the over, after which the bowler gets treatment; I think she, er, dove, onto Sciver\u2019s bat trying to save a single. Ravi Nair would like to play for the England women\u2019s team, saying that \u201cat least some of them aren\u2019t twice my height\u201d. I hope off-red is your colour. 11th over: England 67-2 (Sciver 28, Knight 6) At what point do England seek to put the stamp down? On the one hand, these are their form players, the ones they\u2019ll want to get most of the runs, but on the other, they need to get moving. Some batsmen prefer to just play every ball on its merits and get whatever score they get; others will clue up what a good score is and try for that. On a track like this, I\u2019d suggest that the latter is important, and this over yields just two singles and a two, very bowled by Mohammed. 10th over: England 63-2 (Sciver 27, Knight 3) Stafanie Taylor brings herself on, looking to tempt the batsmen with some loopers. Her first four balls go for singles and a wide follows, before a full toss \u2013 they\u2019ve been pretty nifty so far \u2013 draws Sciver out of her crease, on the stretch, to clout four through square lef. 9th over: England 54-2 (Sciver 21, Knight 1) Sciver takes one to long on, bringing Knight onto strike; she takes a single from her second ball, Sciver then adds one more, and this is extremely well poised. Have a look! Wyatt slaps over the off side towards long on but the contact is far too high on the bat and Selman holds a belter of a catch, sliding in, hands awkwardly positioned. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019ve got to force the issue! 9th over: England 51-1 (Wyatt 29, Sciver 19) Anya Shrubsole says she\u2019s happy with how England are doing, as Wyatt twists two through midwicket. 8th over: England 49-1 (Wyatt 27, Sciver 19) Wyatt carves Fletcher over cover and they run two; she does likewise next ball but this time hits it towards the fielder, the ball dropping just short as they run one. Sciver adds a single of her own and then Campbelle misses one after Wyatt steps across her stumps, leaving but in the process obscuring what\u2019s going on; they run through for two byes and Wyatt then takes one more. West Indies could use a wicket, but England will want to get a wriggle on now. 7th over: England 42-1 (Wyatt 23, Sciver 18) Anisa Mohammad comes on to loop down some off-spinners and this has been a good little period for West Indies, slowing England down just as they looked to be easing away. This over yields three runs, and a fine stop from Hayley Matthews is the highlight; that\u2019s how West Indies need to field, and Stafanie Taylor does similarly two balls later. 6th over: England 39-1 (Wyatt 21, Sciver 17) Fletcher replaces Selman and Wyatt greets her in the proper manner, cutting her first ball through backward point for four; she\u2019s played herself in here. And just as nauseating for West Indies should be the ease with which England are taking singles, another coming immediately thereafter. But Fletcher responds well, her leg spin gripping a little but also doing little enough to give nothing to play with. 5th over: England 34-1 (Wyatt 16, Sciver 17) Matthews into the attack, going around the wicket, and Wyatt takes two to fine leg then absolutely knucks her over square leg for four; what a sound that is! A wide and three ones follow; West Indies need a wicket. And a question from me: you can play for any international team, who are you picking? I\u2019m going Pakistan. 4th over: England 24-1 (Wyatt 8, Sciver 16) Oh that\u2019s nice from Sciver, standing to clout Alleyne down the ground for four, after Wyatt hands her strike with a further single. Two singles, a two and a scoop for four \u2013 Sciver is absolutely having this \u2013 then make it 13 from the over, England\u2019s best so far, and they\u2019re settled out there. \u201cPower\u2019s off here in Bombay,\u201d tweets Ravi Nair. \u201cNo wifi, no TV, 42% battery on my phone. You\u2019re my lifeline on England v West Indies. Please see England through for me?\u201d I would absolutely take no power to be away from the north London wind. I might turn mine off to pretend. 3rd over: England 11-1 (Wyatt 5, Sciver 5) Wyatt is looking sharp, both at finding singles and running between the wickets, nudging another one into the off side; Beaumont does likewise into the leg side. Perhaps the fielders need to come in a coupe of yards, or smarten up. Wyatt then carves two more to deep backward point, one to mid on, and this is already looking like a crucial partnership. 2nd over: England 6-1 (Wyatt 2, Sciver 4) Alleyne comes in from the other end and Wyatt moves over to cut a wide one to backward point; they run one. Two dots follow, and then Sciver comes out of he crease, presumably to find some pace on the ball, and chases a wide one \u2013 she only just gets bat on it \u2013 but does enough to carve four in front of point. Campbelle calls for the helmet, which seems sensible, and this is hotting up. 1st over: England 1-1 (Wyatt 1, Sciver 0) Brilliant start for West Indies, but Sciver is in form and will fancy a nice long go-around. Eeesh! Well that worked then! Selman sends down a slower ball that nips in off the pitch and beats the bat as Beaumont comes forward and misses ... and that is absolutely DEAD! It\u2019s an absolute jaffa is that, that is, and the reality is that England\u2019s approach won\u2019t be shown as right or wrong at least until Jones has batted, though really you can\u2019t judge much on one match. England sensibly decide not to review. 1st over: England 1-0 (Wyatt 0, Beaumont 1) Wyatt leaves the opening delivery and we can see how the slow the ball is off the pitch, going through one bounce; I wonder if Campbelle should be standing up. Wyatt knocks the next ball to cover and nicks a single, bringing Beuamont onto strike... Selman to Wyatt, and off we go! Yup, it\u2019s Wyatt and Beaumont opening. Kate Cross seems to have knacked an ankle \u2013 the footage we see, or her sock being cut off and her being stretchered off, doesn\u2019t look good at all. In short, I would very much like to rally round the West Indies. Anthem time. Beaumont does indeed have the pads on. Here come the teams! Nasser also thinks Beaumont will be coming up the order, while Cricinfo report that Kate Cross, who wasn\u2019t playing, has hurt herself warming up and been driven off the ground. England: Wyatt, Jones, Sciver, Knight, Wilson, Beaumont, Brunt, Shrubsole, Villiers, Ecclestone, Glenn. West Indies: Matthews, Kirby, Taylor, Dottin, Cooper, Campbelle, Alleyne, Nation, Fletcher, Mohammed, Selman. Deandra Dottin is talking about her way back from injury; apparently she practises in her sleep! In commentary, they recon Tammy Beaumont will open tonight. That makes sense to me; the Jones-Wyatt experiment hasn\u2019t worked, and leaving it longer is leaving it too long. We\u2019re watching some VT on Knight, who says she\u2019s not really into Churchillian speeches, but likes to lead by example. Others say she works hard, and runs a happy team; she\u2019s also in serious nick. He\u2019s expecting the ball to die on batsmen, and reckons bowlers should bowl into the pitch, especially spinners. If they bowl full, they\u2019re taking the pitch out of the equation; back of a length, and the batsmen have a problem. It\u2019s pretty windy out in the middle, and with the boundaries largely equidistant, hitting well with the breeze will be key. Nasser Hussain reckons it\u2019s a pitch for cutters, and that 130 might be a decent score. For West Indies, Britney Cooper comes in. Heather Knight says the wicket looks like the ones they played on in Malaysia, but refuses to say whether England will adjust their batting order. I\u2019m guessing they will. Mady Villiers comes in because she wants another spin option on what looks a dryish track. Breaking news: it looks nice in Sydney. This has been a great tournament so far: close games, favourites getting a doing, continuing jeopardy. But, in the end, the whole is judged on classic knockout matches, and more or less, this is the first of those. Then we\u2019ll have Australia v New Zealand, and the last four, which is where things will need to really excel. Earlier today: South Africa secured their spot in the last four, beating Pakistan by 17 runs. They\u2019ve been excellent so far, and a likely semi against Australia will be a nice little tester for them. Elsewhere: in the world Test championship, New Zealand are well set against India, trailing by 96 runs; India have four second-innings wickets left intact. All the talk, all the practise, all the preparation \u2013 and for England, it comes down to this: win and they\u2019re in the last four, lose and they\u2019re relying on South Africa or net run rate Such are tournaments, and such is T20. More than any other version of anything else, T20 can be decided by margins \u2013 most particularly whether one player has a day out. Cricket is already an individual sport masquerading as a team game, but T20 amps that up beyond the norm. If your one to 11 \u201cexecute\u201d then you should win ... but if one of the opposing 11 is a \u201cgun\u201d then you\u2019ve got a problem. On the face of things, England should win here: ultimately, they\u2019re the better team, in better form. But there\u2019s a sense that they\u2019re not quite right, their experimental batting order seeking the best of all worlds, and overcomplicating in the process. West Indies, meanwhile, still boast eight of the team who won this pot in 2016, the problem being that they\u2019re not in anything approaching that kind of form ... except they, or someone, could be.

The pressure on Beaumont to justify her promotion was immense and it told immediately: playing all around a delivery from Selman, she was plumb lbw for a two\u2011ball duck. Danni Wyatt, meanwhile, tried to attack her way out of her own recent dearth of runs, accumulating her highest score of the calendar year \u2013 a 27-ball 29 \u2013 before playing one uppish drive too many, brilliantly caught by a diving Selman at long on. Selman then added further to her personal highlights reel with a direct hit from midwicket to see off the in-form Knight for 17. Knight, perhaps underestimating the accuracy of her opponents \u2013 who lost against Pakistan by eight wickets on Wednesday after dropping a crucial catch and fluffing a run\u2011out \u2013 failed to dive and could not save herself. Sciver could have suffered the same fate at the non-striker\u2019s end early in her innings, had the off-spinner Anisa Mohammed managed to release the ball after diving to retrieve it off her own bowling. Instead, she added insult to injury as she was dropped by Hayley Matthews at midwicket, scampering a single off the same ball to bring up her half-century. Matthews did eventually get her woman, Sciver sending the ball safely into her hands in the penultimate over, but the damage had already been done. West Indies\u2019 reply was dented early when Deandra Dottin, promoted to the opening spot, fell in the third over before disaster struck in the eighth, when Stafanie Taylor suffered a groin injury and had to be carried off on a stretcher. The captain will be unavailable for their remaining group match, against South Africa on Tuesday. Three further wickets then fell with the score on 42 \u2013 Villiers opening up her account in World Cup cricket with a wicket maiden \u2013 and Glenn played a part in England\u2019s first ever successful DRS review when UltraEdge showed Chedean Nation had edged the ball to Jones behind the stumps. Though Lee-Ann Kirby showed some fight for West Indies, thrashing two sixes over long-on, she eventually fell to Anya Shrubsole in the 15th over, and the rest felt like a mere formality for England.",

In Chand Bagh, one of the worst hit areas, only the Muslim businesses \u2013 hairdressers, ice-cream shops, butchers \u2013 lay in ruins. On one corner, the charred husks of hundreds of oranges, bananas and watermelons spilled out of the front of a Muslim fruit stall, filling the air with the putrid smell of burnt fruit.</p> <p>Among the 43 dead was Musharraf, a 30-year-old Muslim man. He was at home with his wife and children in the Bhagirathi Vihar area of Gokalpuri, north-east Delhi, when a mob of around 30 men with iron rods, knives and chains \u2013 many wearing motorcycle helmets so they could not be identified \u2013 broke down the locked door shouting <em>jai Sri Ram</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThey cut the electricity, so it was all dark, and started smashing the house,\u201d recounted Shakir, his brother-in-law. \u201cHis wife was calling the police but they did not come.

She tried to save him but they beat him to death in the middle of the street and threw him in the gutter.\u201d</p> <p>Like so many other Muslims in Delhi, Shakir and his family said that after the riots they could no longer stay in the city they had called home for decades and were moving back to their ancestral village. \u201cWe have never felt threatened and always lived peacefully with our Hindu brothers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel safe anywhere in Delhi now.\u201d</p> <p>Violence has been a stain on India\u2019s history since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/02/wounds-have-never-healed-living-through-terror-partition-india-pakistan-1947\" title=\"\">partition in 1947</a>, when Pakistan was formed as a separate Muslim state and up to two million people died in the fighting and its aftermath. Riots have continued to erupt along religious lines in a country where around 14% of the population are Muslim, with an 80% Hindu majority. The fracturing of relations began in the 1960s and 1970s, but a flashpoint took place in 1992, when a rightwing Hindu mob of thousands, which included several members of the now ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/28/ayodhya-mosque-india-guardian-report\" title=\"\">tore down the Babri </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/28/ayodhya-mosque-india-guardian-report\" title=\"\">mosque</a> in Ayodhya.</p> <p>When the BJP were elected to government in 2014, led by prime minister Narendra Modi, divisions widened. The BJP is the political wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a militant Hindu nationalist paramilitary organisation that has been accused repeatedly of orchestrating attacks on Muslims. The BJP, which believes that India should be a Hindu, not a secular, nation, has fostered an environment of hate in India. Lynchings of Muslims began and Muslims have been gradually relegated to second-class citizens in their own country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"40b8bfd53ee31387387979fa324c27057311aba4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40b8bfd53ee31387387979fa324c27057311aba4/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fellow Muslims mourn Muddasir Khan, who died in the Delhi riots.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fellow Muslims mourn Muddasir Khan, who died in the Delhi riots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adnan Abidi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even before he became prime minister, Modi\u2019s reputation had been tainted by hatred and violence.

Modi denies the charges, which resulted in him being banned from the US. He was cleared by the Indian supreme court in 2012 but has never apologised nor expressed remorse for the killings.</p> <p>His landslide re-election victory in May 2019 prompted an escalation of the Hindu nationalist agenda. But it was the passing of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/india-to-bring-in-law-denying-citizenship-to-muslim-migrants\" title=\"\">citizenship amendment act</a> (CAA) in December last year that proved the tipping point. The law, which grants citizenship for refugees of every major South Asian religion except Muslims, was widely condemned as discriminatory. Many saw it as an attempt to enshrine the Hindu nationalist agenda into law and undermine the country\u2019s secular foundations.</p> <p>The controversy has triggered India\u2019s longest period of unrest in 40 years, with millions of people of all religions taking to the streets in protest. But the BJP response has been to ramp up their rhetoric, particularly in the recent Delhi state assembly elections. \u201cThe BJP began fermenting this crisis in Delhi weeks ago, as a way to win Hindu votes in the election,\u201d said Ashis Nandy, a well-known political commentator.</p> <p>The spark for the latest violence was provided by Kapil Mishra, a BJP leader who had just lost his seat in those elections, when he incited a Hindu mob to violently remove a group of Muslims who were blocking a road in north-east Delhi in protest against the CAA. Addressing the peaceful protest, Mishra issued an inflammatory ultimatum: \u201cIf the roads are not cleared \u2026 we will be forced to hit the streets.\u201d Stone pelting began between Muslims and Hindus, which quickly descended into the violence that spread through the city.</p> <p>But these riots were not simply neighbours turning against neighbours. Last Sunday, false rumours of a Muslim uprising spread across rightwing Hindu social media, alleging dozens of mosques in Delhi had announced over loudspeakers that they would throw all Hindus out of Delhi and that the police had arrested 32 imams. It prompted many outside Delhi to comment that they would come out to \u201cteach our Muslim brothers a lesson\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>They kicked my stomach and my whole body. I pleaded with them not to harm my baby,  but they kept kicking</p> <footer> <cite>Muskan, 20, victim of the mob</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Soon after, residents in Mustafabad, an area right on the edge of Delhi badly affected by the riots, reported seeing Hindu youths armed with machetes, metal rods and wooden sticks coming in trucks from the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. \u201cWe all saw truckloads of these mobs coming over the border from Uttar Pradesh, it was outsiders who came in and incited the violence,\u201d said Shoaib Alam, 32. \u201cAnd that then stirred up local people.\u201d</p> <p>Uttar Pradesh, whose BJP chief minister is the firebrand Hindu nationalist and openly Islamaphobic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/19/uttar-pradesh-yogi-adityanath-hindu-priest-chief-minister\" title=\"\">Yogi Adityanath</a>, is a notorious hotbed of criminal activity and lawlessness. Uttar Pradesh has also been the state accused of carrying out some of the worst state-sponsored attacks, detention and torture of Muslims in a crackdown against the anti-CAA protests.</p> <p>\u201cI have not the slightest doubt that this was not a chance, spontaneous riot,\u201d said Harsh Mander, an author and activist who is director of the Centre for Equity Studies, a Delhi research organisation. \u201cIt was certainly orchestrated and built up as part of the politics of the ruling party. I think the BJP were unnerved by the scale of the protest against the citizenship amendment law and, more specifically, that it was Hindus and Muslims coming out together in the resistance.</p> <p>\u201cIt was only a matter of time before they would try and convert it into a Hindu-Muslim violent riot and encourage the most primal kind of hatred that wins them support. And after their defeat in the Delhi election, it seems this was an outlet for all the hatred they built up.\u201d</p> <p>Government spokesman Raveesh Kumar denied that the Modi government had inflamed religious tensions or had any role in the riots. \u201cThese are factually inaccurate and misleading, and appear to be aimed at politicising the issue,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In al-Hind hospital, a cramped and basic medical facility in Mustafabad which was on the frontline of the violence, Dr Meeraj Ekram looked shellshocked as he spoke of the more than 500 victims that had come through its doors since the riots began. Mainly they had gunshot wounds, but there were also stabbings, acid burns and mutilated genitalia. Police were not allowing ambulances into Mustafabad to rescue the wounded, and hundreds of patients lay on the floor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07f29520597ac1c820647d3b3e80c0985219a961\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07f29520597ac1c820647d3b3e80c0985219a961/0_190_5702_3421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burnt out shops in Delhi after the riots.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burnt out shops in Delhi after the riots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Money Sharma/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe injuries we were seeing were horrifying; I have never seen such terrible things in my whole life,\u201d said Ekram. Muskan, a 20-year-old Muslim girl who was eight months pregnant, lay in a critical condition in a hospital bed after she was set upon by a Hindu mob. \u201cThey threw me to the ground, kicked my stomach and my whole body,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI pleaded with them not to harm my baby, I said \u2018please, please\u2019 over and over, but they kept kicking.\u201d</p> <p>Also among the patients brought into al-Hind on Tuesday night were two local imams. With a grimace, Ekram showed photos of the imam of Shiv Vihar mosque, whose face had been badly disfigured. When men had entered the mosque, the imam had attempted to run away but had been caught by the mobs, who threw a bucket of acid into his face.</p> <p>Mufti Mohammad Tahir, the imam of Farooqia mosque, near Mustafabad, suffered a similar fate. He told the <em>Observer</em> how he had locked himself in an upper room of the mosque when the riots broke out. But police broke down the door, dragged him out and handed him to the waiting Hindu mobs, who beat him unconscious, smashing his limbs. The mosque was torched: shelves of dozens of blackened qu\u2019rans lined one wall and a bowl containing burned fragments of Islamic religious scripture sat on a table.</p> <p>Many who witnessed the riots claim that police stood by as Muslims were attacked or helped the Hindu mobs. Most of those who called the police for help did so in vain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/india-riotmapnew/giv-3902WSN8aIza32pk/\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/india-riotmapnew/giv-3902WSN8aIza32pk/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>While the Delhi government is controlled by the progressive Aam Aadmi party (AAP), the Delhi police are under the control of the BJP minister for home affairs, Amit Shah. The police have said the focus of their investigation into the riots is on local Muslim leaders, while no BJP leaders have been charged. Delhi police were not available for comment.</p> <p>Even the local politician for Mustafabad, the AAP\u2019s Haji Yunus, described how the police ignored his requests for help. \u201cI made several calls to the police station and they did nothing to help,\u201d he said. \u201cMy entire government felt helpless, there was no way for us get the situation under control. There was no effort from police at all for at least two days. The police were not even allowing the ambulances through to carry out the injured people.\u201d</p> <p>Yunus said that the hatred stirred up by the BJP in the Delhi elections should be investigated. \u201cThe BJP did not think they could be defeated so badly in the election and so after they lost, they let out their frustration this way.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the prospect of holding Delhi police to account for their role in the riots through the legal system looks increasingly unlikely. Justice S Muralidhar, a judge in the Delhi high court, openly condemned the actions of the police and government last Wednesday at a hearing into the riots. But by Thursday morning, the judge was transferred to another court and the case was taken from him. The new judge gave the government four weeks to respond to the charges.</p> <p>But for all the tales of discord, dozens of accounts were also given to the <em>Observer</em> of how Sikh and Hindu families helped save their Muslim neighbours, sheltering them in their homes as the violence broke out or helping them escape as the mobs descended.</p> <p>One Hindu man, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, spoke of how he secretly escorted seven Muslim families to safety in Shiv Vihar.</p> <p>\u201cI formed a small group involving a few other elderly Hindu neighbours and we managed to thwart the planned attacks on those Muslim households,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the Hindu-majority neighbourhood of Gokalpuri, a Sikh father, Mohinder Singh, 53, and his son Inderjit used their motorcycles to rescue around 70 Muslim men and children, the youngest just nine years old. They had been trapped in the mosque and madrasa, as a mob roamed the streets outside. Singh took the children two at a time on his bike, putting turbans on their heads as a disguise.</p> <p>\u201cI did not see if they were Muslim or Hindu, I did this for humanity,\u201d said Mohinder. \u201cI had to save them.\u201d</p> <p>Majinder Singh Sirsa, a Sikh leader in Delhi, said the community had opened up its gurdwaras for shelter, but had been attacked by hardline Hindu and Muslim groups for doing so. \u201cWe do feel the pain because we were also targeted 35 years ago,\u201d he said, referring to the anti-Sikh pogroms in Delhi in 1984 where more than 3,000 Sikhs were killed. \u201cBack then, Delhi was burning and humanity died. This week, it has happened once again.\u201d</p> <p><em>Shaikh Azizur Rahman contributed to this report</em></p>",

When the BJP were elected to government in 2014, led by prime minister Narendra Modi, divisions widened. The BJP is the political wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a militant Hindu nationalist paramilitary organisation that has been accused repeatedly of orchestrating attacks on Muslims. The BJP, which believes that India should be a Hindu, not a secular, nation, has fostered an environment of hate in India. Lynchings of Muslims began and Muslims have been gradually relegated to second-class citizens in their own country.

And after their defeat in the Delhi election, it seems this was an outlet for all the hatred they built up.\u201d Government spokesman Raveesh Kumar denied that the Modi government had inflamed religious tensions or had any role in the riots. \u201cThese are factually inaccurate and misleading, and appear to be aimed at politicising the issue,\u201d he said. In al-Hind hospital, a cramped and basic medical facility in Mustafabad which was on the frontline of the violence, Dr Meeraj Ekram looked shellshocked as he spoke of the more than 500 victims that had come through its doors since the riots began. Mainly they had gunshot wounds, but there were also stabbings, acid burns and mutilated genitalia. Police were not allowing ambulances into Mustafabad to rescue the wounded, and hundreds of patients lay on the floor. \u201cThe injuries we were seeing were horrifying; I have never seen such terrible things in my whole life,\u201d said Ekram. Muskan, a 20-year-old Muslim girl who was eight months pregnant, lay in a critical condition in a hospital bed after she was set upon by a Hindu mob. \u201cThey threw me to the ground, kicked my stomach and my whole body,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI pleaded with them not to harm my baby, I said \u2018please, please\u2019 over and over, but they kept kicking.\u201d Also among the patients brought into al-Hind on Tuesday night were two local imams. With a grimace, Ekram showed photos of the imam of Shiv Vihar mosque, whose face had been badly disfigured. When men had entered the mosque, the imam had attempted to run away but had been caught by the mobs, who threw a bucket of acid into his face. Mufti Mohammad Tahir, the imam of Farooqia mosque, near Mustafabad, suffered a similar fate. He told the Observer how he had locked himself in an upper room of the mosque when the riots broke out. But police broke down the door, dragged him out and handed him to the waiting Hindu mobs, who beat him unconscious, smashing his limbs. The mosque was torched: shelves of dozens of blackened qu\u2019rans lined one wall and a bowl containing burned fragments of Islamic religious scripture sat on a table. Many who witnessed the riots claim that police stood by as Muslims were attacked or helped the Hindu mobs. Most of those who called the police for help did so in vain. While the Delhi government is controlled by the progressive Aam Aadmi party (AAP), the Delhi police are under the control of the BJP minister for home affairs, Amit Shah. The police have said the focus of their investigation into the riots is on local Muslim leaders, while no BJP leaders have been charged. Delhi police were not available for comment. Even the local politician for Mustafabad, the AAP\u2019s Haji Yunus, described how the police ignored his requests for help. \u201cI made several calls to the police station and they did nothing to help,\u201d he said. \u201cMy entire government felt helpless, there was no way for us get the situation under control. There was no effort from police at all for at least two days. The police were not even allowing the ambulances through to carry out the injured people.\u201d Yunus said that the hatred stirred up by the BJP in the Delhi elections should be investigated. \u201cThe BJP did not think they could be defeated so badly in the election and so after they lost, they let out their frustration this way.\u201d Yet the prospect of holding Delhi police to account for their role in the riots through the legal system looks increasingly unlikely. Justice S Muralidhar, a judge in the Delhi high court, openly condemned the actions of the police and government last Wednesday at a hearing into the riots. But by Thursday morning, the judge was transferred to another court and the case was taken from him. The new judge gave the government four weeks to respond to the charges. But for all the tales of discord, dozens of accounts were also given to the Observer of how Sikh and Hindu families helped save their Muslim neighbours, sheltering them in their homes as the violence broke out or helping them escape as the mobs descended. One Hindu man, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, spoke of how he secretly escorted seven Muslim families to safety in Shiv Vihar. \u201cI formed a small group involving a few other elderly Hindu neighbours and we managed to thwart the planned attacks on those Muslim households,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, in the Hindu-majority neighbourhood of Gokalpuri, a Sikh father, Mohinder Singh, 53, and his son Inderjit used their motorcycles to rescue around 70 Muslim men and children, the youngest just nine years old. They had been trapped in the mosque and madrasa, as a mob roamed the streets outside. Singh took the children two at a time on his bike, putting turbans on their heads as a disguise. \u201cI did not see if they were Muslim or Hindu, I did this for humanity,\u201d said Mohinder. \u201cI had to save them.\u201d Majinder Singh Sirsa, a Sikh leader in Delhi, said the community had opened up its gurdwaras for shelter, but had been attacked by hardline Hindu and Muslim groups for doing so. \u201cWe do feel the pain because we were also targeted 35 years ago,\u201d he said, referring to the anti-Sikh pogroms in Delhi in 1984 where more than 3,000 Sikhs were killed. \u201cBack then, Delhi was burning and humanity died. This week, it has happened once again.\u201d Shaikh Azizur Rahman contributed to this report",

It emerged on Saturday that newly retired doctors and nurses could be asked to return to the NHS as part of the plan to combat a possible further spread of the coronavirus. If the outbreak worsens, people could also be urged to work from home under the government\u2019s contingency proposals. A minister in every government department will be focused on tackling the outbreak while a team of experts will drive a public health campaign. Hancock also played down a report in the Guardian that England has only 15 available beds for adults to treat the most severe respiratory failure. Referring to ventilators, he said the Guardian\u2019s figures were out of date. \u201cWe have 50 now, and we can ramp that up to 500.

Harris and her friends rushed inside the school building to gather their belongings. </p> <p>The night she joined the marches, Harris and her 13-year-old brother sat down with their mother, the family breadwinner who worked at a cigar factory. \u201cI told her it was because she wasn\u2019t allowed to register to vote and so many other people couldn\u2019t,\u201d Harris said. </p> <p>Harris skipped school for a week to attend trainings, where they were warned about potential violence from possemen, the nickname for the often-savage volunteer local law enforcement.</p> <p>Even so, those first marches through town were \u201cjubilant\u201d for Harris. A photograph shows her in a crowd that sang freedom songs and held up signs reading \u201clet my parents vote\u201d.</p> <p>Harris was arrested twice, had her fingerprints and mugshot taken and had to sleep in a jail cell one night. \u201cWe were treated as if we were criminals,\u201d she said. </p> <p>During those early marches, at least 2,000 demonstrators were jailed in Dallas county. Despite the arrests, the protests spread to nearby towns. In Marion, Alabama, Jimmie Lee Jackson, a 26-year-old deacon participating at a peaceful protest, was brutally beaten and shot by an Alabama state trooper on 18 February and later died.</p> <p>With Jackson\u2019s death, the dam broke.</p> <h2><strong>Charles Mauldin: \u2018Either we were going to go forward or were going to die\u2019</strong></h2> <p><br>After the killing, civil rights group groups called for a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama\u2019s capital, and encouraged young people in Selma to join them.</p> <p>The organizers asked questions like \u201cWhy can\u2019t your parents vote?\u201d or \u201cWhy do you have to drink from the colored fountain?\u201d, recalled Charles Mauldin, then 17 and a junior at the local high school.

      "bodyText": "It was one of the most celebrated events of civil rights movement: a march of thousands, met with violence and teargas, that was supposed to cement the right to vote for millions of African Americans who had been denied it by the white majority. On Sunday, the last generation of living civil rights leaders and some of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are gathering in the small town of Selma, Alabama, to celebrate the 55th anniversary of the Selma-to-Montgomery marches. The Guardian has tracked down four activists who appeared in archival photographs to find out what happened beyond the camera lens, and whether the promise of Selma has been realized. At the time of the protests, many southern states used arbitrary \u201cliteracy\u201d tests and physical intimidation to keep black Americans from the ballot box. As a result, although African Americans comprised 57% of the population of Dallas county, of which Selma is the county seat, only 2% were registered to vote. The 54-mile march in early 1965 drew global attention to the brutality of police toward peaceful protesters and led President Lyndon B Johnson to pass the Voting Rights Act, a signature achievement of the civil rights era that outlawed voter suppression. Yet, almost six decades later, has America truly become a place where black Americans can exercise their democratic right to vote without interference? Thelma Dianne Harris: \u2018We were treated as if we were criminals\u2019 The Civil Rights Act was passed in in 1964 after years of demonstrations against segregation in the south, but the act excluded a key protection: the right to vote. Around late January and early February of 1965, 15-year-old Thelma Dianne Harris was eating lunch with friends outside her Selma high school when a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), a national network of student activists, approached and asked if they wanted to join a group organizing at a local church in support of voting rights. \u201cI was the one who asked, \u2018Right now?\u2019 He said \u2018Yes\u2019,\u201d Harris, now 70, recalled. Harris and her friends rushed inside the school building to gather their belongings. The night she joined the marches, Harris and her 13-year-old brother sat down with their mother, the family breadwinner who worked at a cigar factory. \u201cI told her it was because she wasn\u2019t allowed to register to vote and so many other people couldn\u2019t,\u201d Harris said. Harris skipped school for a week to attend trainings, where they were warned about potential violence from possemen, the nickname for the often-savage volunteer local law enforcement. Even so, those first marches through town were \u201cjubilant\u201d for Harris. A photograph shows her in a crowd that sang freedom songs and held up signs reading \u201clet my parents vote\u201d. Harris was arrested twice, had her fingerprints and mugshot taken and had to sleep in a jail cell one night. \u201cWe were treated as if we were criminals,\u201d she said. During those early marches, at least 2,000 demonstrators were jailed in Dallas county. Despite the arrests, the protests spread to nearby towns. In Marion, Alabama, Jimmie Lee Jackson, a 26-year-old deacon participating at a peaceful protest, was brutally beaten and shot by an Alabama state trooper on 18 February and later died. With Jackson\u2019s death, the dam broke. Charles Mauldin: \u2018Either we were going to go forward or were going to die\u2019 After the killing, civil rights group groups called for a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama\u2019s capital, and encouraged young people in Selma to join them. The organizers asked questions like \u201cWhy can\u2019t your parents vote?\u201d or \u201cWhy do you have to drink from the colored fountain?\u201d, recalled Charles Mauldin, then 17 and a junior at the local high school. He felt like he had no good answers. \u201cWe had been intimidated into accepting segregation so severely that we didn\u2019t think outside of the box. It was too dangerous \u2013 we would have been lynched or run out of town had we done that,\u201d said Mauldin, now 73. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the vocabulary to discuss our sense of grievance.\u201d Mauldin became a student leader, helping to coordinate the march and pass out leaflets for weeks in advance. On 7 March 1965, he was one of over 600 demonstrators who lined up two-by-two on the street in Selma and marched six blocks from Brown Chapel AME Church, the organizers\u2019 de facto Selma headquarters, to the Edmund Pettus Bridge, spanning the Alabama river. A photograph shows him two rows behind civil rights leader Hosea Williams and now-congressman John Lewis. There were Alabama state troopers on the other side. Mauldin remembers a colonel telling marchers \u201cThis is an illegal gathering. Either go back to your churches or go home.\u201d The group had bowed down to pray when the state troopers began to storm them with billy clubs. Mauldin was near Lewis as he was brutally beaten by the trooper. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the sound of his head being crushed. I\u2019ll never forget that.\u201d Tear gas dispersed the crowd, and Mauldin ran to the river\u2019s edge for a gulp of fresh air. That day would become known as Bloody Sunday. \u201cWe went past our fears. I\u2019m quite sure at some point, there was an acknowledgement that it was dangerous, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make us quit or slow down,\u201d Mauldin said. \u201cEither we were going to go forward or we were going to die. Those were the only choices we had.\u201d Harriet Michel: \u2018It was just a moment your heart stops\u2019 After Bloody Sunday, organizers spread the word about a larger march in Selma, encouraging people across the country to join them and ratchet up pressure on federal officials to halt the violence. Harriet Michel, then 22, was one of about 18 students and staff from Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania who heeded the call. Rather than Selma, they headed to Montgomery, Alabama, where activists were needed to encourage people in predominantly black neighborhoods to register to vote. For a few days, Michel and her group marched, sang hymns and appealed to African Americans sitting on their porches. Though people were excited to see the group, \u201cthey were also scared to death to come off of those porches\u201d, said Michel, now 77. After two or three days, Alabama state police on horseback surrounded the group on a neighborhood street and charged at them. \u201cWhen you see a big beast rearing up in front of you with their hooves in the air getting to come down on you or near you, it\u2019s terrifying,\u201d Michel said. \u201cIt was just a moment your heart stops and you think, \u2018I\u2019m going to die\u2019.\u201d Michel had been marching next to Galway Kinnell, a friend and poet who had a residency at Juniata. A man with a billy club rushed at Kinnell and started beating him. \u201cHe was, in my view, trying to poke his eye out,\u201d Michel said. The baton hit Kinnell\u2019s eye bone and split his cheek open. A photographer with the Juniata group snapped a picture of Michel, a look of gentle concern on her face, clutching Kinnell, whose shirt is covered in blood. \u201cIt took a long time to make my peace with a horse after the episode,\u201d Michel said. That night, several national news channels broadcast the picture of Michel and Kinnell. And President Johnson delivered his now-famous televised national plea to Congress: \u201cIt is all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. \u201cAnd we shall overcome.\u201d Donzaleigh Abernathy: \u2018We had to do our part in this small window of time\u2019 Following Johnson\u2019s address, a federal judge overturned Alabama governor George Wallace\u2019s prohibition on demonstrations. And Johnson ordered the national guard and US army to protect marchers, who began the trek to Montgomery, aiming to cover about 10 miles a day. In a photo showing the front row on the fourth day of the march, three children are standing in front of Dr Martin Luther King and his wife, Coretta Scott King, singing along with the civil rights leaders around them. On the left, wearing a striped sweater and a defiant expression, is Donzaleigh Abernathy. Her activist parents, the Rev Ralph Abernathy and Juanita Abernathy, insisted that their children participate and put them up front so they could keep an eye on them. The kids were given salt tablets so they would not have to use the restroom as frequently. \u201cAt age seven, I was keenly aware that life is precious, that people are murdered because of their political beliefs or because they\u2019re trying to do good in the world.

After they made it to Montgomery, Abernathy was backstage when King delivered his famous \u201chow long, not long\u201d speech to a roaring crowd. As King reached the repetitive part of the speech, chanting \u201chow long, not long,\u201d Abernathy lifted her arms and pumped her hands into the sky in time with the refrain, deeply moved. \u201cIt was an incredible day,\u201d Abernathy said. \u201cA day I\u2019ll never, ever, ever forget.\u201d Selma in 2020: \u2018the struggle continues\u2019 The marches prompted Congress to pass a bill to protect voting rights.

Many grow wild on roadsides, or you can stumble across them in forest clearings. The season is short (until mid-March) but the pine forests, ancient monasteries and mountain backdrop won\u2019t disappoint. Restaurants are sparse outside A\u00ednsa, so pack a picnic and enjoy the tranquillity. Don\u2019t miss the hike to Muro de Roda, where an ancient church and monastery overlook mountains and lakes. Take the circular route back across the valley to Luj\u00e1n to pass more fields of almond trees in blossom. Days are usually clear and sunny, but nights are cold.

Over on Arr\u00e1bida, a walk through the fragrant maquis will wow you with fruit-laden strawberry trees, hidden glades of bluebells, gorgeous miniature hoop-petticoat daffodils, and more orchids than you can shake a stick at.

The cafe at Kl\u00e1\u0161torisko, as well as serving excellent pancakes, is set in a wide meadow. Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves is the best jumping-off point, about 4\u00bd hours by train from Bratislava. Tourist information there sells excellent walking maps. Then it\u2019s a short bus or taxi ride to \u010cingov, where the Penzi\u00f3n Lesnica, about \u20ac30 a night, is right by one of the entrances to the park. Alan Petals in the Picos, Spain The Picos de Europa, north-west Spain, are superb for spring flowers. Orchids in every shade of pink and purple, deep-azure gentians, saxifrages, wild daffodils and baby tulips with miles of mountain meadows to feast your eyes on, while eagles, hawks and vultures circle and woodpeckers keep rhythm with your footfall in the trees. Lower down, species of butterfly you\u2019ve never seen before dart ahead on the path. There are well-signposted walks as strenuous or as easy as you like them, with not another soul in sight. And for a bird\u2019s-eye view take the cable car at Fuente D\u00e9 (\u20ac16 return). It will deliver you into a snowfield in sunshine. I recommend the picturesque town of Potes as a base. It is at the heart of the Picos with plenty of accommodation to suit all tastes.

      "body": "<p>Someone asked me the other day what historical dance work I would like to have seen. I plumped for the first night, in 1946, of <em>Symphonic Variations</em>, the work with which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/frederickashton\" title=\"\">Frederick Ashton</a> defined British ballet. My friend chose the riot-scarred premiere of Stravinsky\u2019s <em>The Rite of Spring</em> (1913), which is probably a better choice. But I\u2019d also love to have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/feb/04/gender.uk\" title=\"\">Isadora Duncan</a> dance.</p> <p>The problem with Duncan, who was born in 1877 and died at the age of 50, is that dance-lovers \u2013 and feminists \u2013 know she was important. She threw out corsets, shoes and pretty steps to plug herself into the elemental soul of dance, making it express profound emotion and fierce freedom. When a teenage Ashton saw her, he was entranced; his <em>Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan</em> (1976) is included in <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/viviana-durante-company-isadora-now\" title=\"\">this programme</a> by the <strong><a href=\"http://www.viviana-durante.com/\" title=\"\">Viviana Durante Company</a></strong>. So is <em>Dance of the Furies</em>, to Gluck, recreated by Barbara Kane and Durante from steps supposedly choreographed by Duncan herself.</p> <p>Both short pieces are problematic; it\u2019s as if we are looking the wrong way through the telescope of history, and instead of coming into close-up, Duncan\u2019s significance seems diminished. The Ashton is lovely, played beautifully by pianist Anna Geniushene, and it is danced with a pensive grace by Bego\u00f1a Cao (stepping in at short notice for an injured Durante), but its peach-costumed poses, elegant skips and dramatic runs only give us glimpses of the force of nature that the dancer supposedly was.</p> <p><em>Dance of the Furies</em>, on the other hand, reported in its day (1911) to be ugly in its depiction of women red in tooth and claw, now looks positively quaint as the five women batter their fists against the sky and run with their hands behind their backs.

      "bodyText": "Someone asked me the other day what historical dance work I would like to have seen. I plumped for the first night, in 1946, of Symphonic Variations, the work with which Frederick Ashton defined British ballet. My friend chose the riot-scarred premiere of Stravinsky\u2019s The Rite of Spring (1913), which is probably a better choice. But I\u2019d also love to have seen Isadora Duncan dance. The problem with Duncan, who was born in 1877 and died at the age of 50, is that dance-lovers \u2013 and feminists \u2013 know she was important. She threw out corsets, shoes and pretty steps to plug herself into the elemental soul of dance, making it express profound emotion and fierce freedom. When a teenage Ashton saw her, he was entranced; his Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan (1976) is included in this programme by the Viviana Durante Company. So is Dance of the Furies, to Gluck, recreated by Barbara Kane and Durante from steps supposedly choreographed by Duncan herself. Both short pieces are problematic; it\u2019s as if we are looking the wrong way through the telescope of history, and instead of coming into close-up, Duncan\u2019s significance seems diminished. The Ashton is lovely, played beautifully by pianist Anna Geniushene, and it is danced with a pensive grace by Bego\u00f1a Cao (stepping in at short notice for an injured Durante), but its peach-costumed poses, elegant skips and dramatic runs only give us glimpses of the force of nature that the dancer supposedly was. Dance of the Furies, on the other hand, reported in its day (1911) to be ugly in its depiction of women red in tooth and claw, now looks positively quaint as the five women batter their fists against the sky and run with their hands behind their backs. There are some insights, but it feels tame. Durante and her collaborators have done their best to catch the mood Duncan supposedly conjured. The design team have created a mistily lit space that evokes Greek temples; there is fire; there are draped costumes. But it is in the final piece, Unda, a new work choreographed by Joy Alpuerto Ritter for six female dancers, that the most interesting glimpse of Duncan emerges. Ritter has looked at history and incorporates elements of Duncan\u2019s tragic life. There\u2019s a sequence where a backlit figure seems to be in agony, as if mourning a family group seen in the foreground; water, important to Duncan, falls into ceramic bowls.

Within this remit, SHA managed to create spectacularly appetising meals, worlds away from the chicken and broccoli on which I\u2019d been subsisting until then. That I spent my four days in SHA eating these meals 3ft away from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/javierbardem\" title=\"\">Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz</a> was an unexpected bonus, and one upon which it would be gauche for me to dwell.</p> <p>SHA\u2019s approach to wellbeing is famously thorough and I sampled more than a dozen treatments, from yoga and training sessions to acupuncture and cupping, to deep tissue, Indiba, and aqua-cranio-cervical massage. The best of these was a mix of water therapy and shiatsu \u2013 colloquially termed \u201cwatsu\u201d \u2013 which involved being fitted with floatation devices and being walked around a body-temperature pool held by a burly physiotherapist, for an hour of ego-dissolving bliss.</p> <p>If I\u2019d wondered what five-star wellness felt like beforehand, SHA left no room for doubt thereafter. <em><strong>S\u00e9amas O\u2019Reilly</strong></em><br><em>From </em><em>\u00a3335 per night, <a href=\"https://shawellnessclinic.com/en/\" title=\"\">shawellnessclinic.com</a></em></p> <h2>Six Senses Kaplankaya, Turkey</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed75e3528b57f3bd34ff94b643af0a89ae9065c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed75e3528b57f3bd34ff94b643af0a89ae9065c2/0_523_3508_2106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Time to relax: one of the open-air pools at Six Senses Kaplankaya in Turkey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Time to relax: one of the open-air pools at Six Senses Kaplankaya in Turkey</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, I love a properly indulgent spa that knows what it\u2019s doing and Turkey\u2019s Six Senses Kaplankaya, across the bay from Bodrum, is as high-end as they come. If you love dressing for dinner and joyful routes to health (in that order) and do not care for irrigation via your private parts, painful exercise or food privation, this is your spot. You can have the hardcore treatments: specialist practitioners offer everything from wellness screenings for tailored nutrition and exercise plans, to weight, sleep and stress management, and Ayurvedic practices such as pranic healing and Vedic astrology. Or you can waft about in the dream of a spa for three days, as did my friend and I.</p> <p>We fell asleep in the crystal steam room, threw ice at each other in the igloo then had \u201cexperiential\u201d showers (experiential rain is a thing; my favourites were the Arctic, accompanied by stormy sound effects, and Rainforest) and sat in the salt grotto and on hot stone benches. I gave myself over; I surrendered; I relaxed.</p> <p>The capacious, modern resort comprises an indoor and outdoor pool, seven bays and three beaches.

      "bodyText": "SHA Wellness Clinic, Alicante, Spain Set into Alicante\u2019s Sierra Helada mountains, SHA\u2019s sharp curves and clean white lines give it the overstated cool of an Ibizan super-club, or a pharmacy on the USS Enterprise. I\u2019d just begun an incredibly restrictive diet (part of a mad life challenge that shall one day bear fruit, maybe) and the nutrition plan for my stay was meticulously tailored to my incredibly exacting needs. Within this remit, SHA managed to create spectacularly appetising meals, worlds away from the chicken and broccoli on which I\u2019d been subsisting until then. That I spent my four days in SHA eating these meals 3ft away from Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz was an unexpected bonus, and one upon which it would be gauche for me to dwell. SHA\u2019s approach to wellbeing is famously thorough and I sampled more than a dozen treatments, from yoga and training sessions to acupuncture and cupping, to deep tissue, Indiba, and aqua-cranio-cervical massage. The best of these was a mix of water therapy and shiatsu \u2013 colloquially termed \u201cwatsu\u201d \u2013 which involved being fitted with floatation devices and being walked around a body-temperature pool held by a burly physiotherapist, for an hour of ego-dissolving bliss. If I\u2019d wondered what five-star wellness felt like beforehand, SHA left no room for doubt thereafter.

If you love dressing for dinner and joyful routes to health (in that order) and do not care for irrigation via your private parts, painful exercise or food privation, this is your spot. You can have the hardcore treatments: specialist practitioners offer everything from wellness screenings for tailored nutrition and exercise plans, to weight, sleep and stress management, and Ayurvedic practices such as pranic healing and Vedic astrology. Or you can waft about in the dream of a spa for three days, as did my friend and I. We fell asleep in the crystal steam room, threw ice at each other in the igloo then had \u201cexperiential\u201d showers (experiential rain is a thing; my favourites were the Arctic, accompanied by stormy sound effects, and Rainforest) and sat in the salt grotto and on hot stone benches. I gave myself over; I surrendered; I relaxed. The capacious, modern resort comprises an indoor and outdoor pool, seven bays and three beaches. We lowered the tone and bagsied sun loungers on a slightly remote (we could still see the beach bar) rocky promontory, then devoured the exquisite buffet breakfast al fresco in the stylish Sage and Thyme restaurant, one of three. One afternoon, we pootled about on sea bikes \u2013 catamaran-bike hybrids that are proof that exercise can be fun. Next morning we did a coastal walk before a group stretch in a cliff-top gazebo.

      "body": "<p>I was 47, shaking and with tears streaming down my face as I held a perfect baby girl in my arms. My body was zinging with oxytocin, the bonding hormone, in response to her smell and touch, those little breaths \u2013 it felt as if she was <em>my</em> newborn baby. She wasn\u2019t. She was my first grandchild. My daughter\u2019s daughter. I\u2019d become a mum at 21, she was 26\u2026</p> <p>The following evening, for my best friend\u2019s landmark birthday, I had made an effort \u2013hair done, party frock, high heels \u2013 and I stepped confidently into the room. The first person I saw shouted: \u201cHi Grandma!\u201d</p> <p>I had to stop myself from slapping him. I was totally up for the love of this new being in my life, but I was by no means ready for the new status of grandmother.</p> <p>It forced me to re-evaluate how I saw myself; how to reconfigure my relationship with my daughter to allow her the space to be the mother she needed to be \u2013 and work out what kind of grandmother I was. And, of course, there were my issues around ageing. I\u2019d seen other phases of my life as a development, but for me being a grandmother brought up images of grey-haired old women on the slippery slope to death. I wanted to avoid it \u2013 anti-ageing being the operative word. But I couldn\u2019t. I had to face the discomfort, the siren call of change, and do the work of change.</p> <p>I needed the courage and endurance to actively adapt, allowing the pull and push of expanding to love anew while facing the challenge of letting go. It meant I had to let the anxious feelings run through my body, rather than cut them off with busyness, which is my most common defence. I often think of it like the weather: I needed to let the storm run through my system, while supporting myself by a process of talking, crying and running to reduce the stressors charging around my body. Then choosing to do things that comforted me: cosy TV viewing, hugs, meditation, delicious food.</p> <p><em><strong>My experience felt</strong></em> unique and somehow unfamiliar, but research shows that change \u2013 either through choice, external events or developmentally \u2013 occurs every seven to 10 years. Yes the seven-year itch is true. It is important to set it in the context that there has been more societal change in the past 50 years than ever before. Boundaries are more fluid in work, love, health, sexuality, gender, identity and religion. I couldn\u2019t look at my mother and see her as a road map of how I wanted to be as a grandmother. I had more choices, which should have been exciting, but actually felt overwhelming. Life is change, I know it, and yet my experience, as it is for others, was trickier than I expected, and I assumed I must be doing it wrong.</p> <p>I have been a psychotherapist for 30 years and every person who has walked through my door has had a problematic relationship with change. It could be that they hated not having control over the circumstances that had been forced on them, or they were furious with their emotional self for not catching up and chiming with their new job, role or status. Confusion triggered by anxiety was their first response: the external event was easy to describe, but making sense of how they felt was not.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When we try and resist change we have worse outcomes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They usually blocked the pain by shutting down, but when they blocked one end of their emotional spectrum, they also blocked the other \u2013 their capacity to feel joy. They had to open themselves up to their full experience and recognise they couldn\u2019t fix it or will it to be different. Our work was to examine their conflicting thoughts, support them to express their feelings, bring to the surface what might be hidden and help them come to accept it \u2013 until there came a moment when they realised they had integrated the change.</p> <p>The process requires patience and commitment \u2013 it can take up to a year, or more. Whether the changes feel like success or failure, the key is to learn from them \u2013 for that is how we expand and grow through our life. When we resist change we have worse outcomes. The evidence is unequivocal. Those who resist change suffer more when change is forced on them \u2013 and have less joy and less success in life.</p> <p>At the heart of change is identity. When someone asks themselves who am I, it is through identity that they find their answers. A cohesive sense of identity is fundamental to our mental health, and if there is a clash with who we know we are and who we think we should be, we suffer.</p> <p>One of my clients, Owen, was struggling with his identity. He was 22 and had been having a difficult time since coming out at university. He\u2019d begun to question everything and started to feel uneasy and awkward around people who had previously been his bedrock.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I came out,\u201d he told me, \u201cthat pretty much changed my entire life.

      "bodyText": "I was 47, shaking and with tears streaming down my face as I held a perfect baby girl in my arms. My body was zinging with oxytocin, the bonding hormone, in response to her smell and touch, those little breaths \u2013 it felt as if she was my newborn baby. She wasn\u2019t. She was my first grandchild. My daughter\u2019s daughter. I\u2019d become a mum at 21, she was 26\u2026 The following evening, for my best friend\u2019s landmark birthday, I had made an effort \u2013hair done, party frock, high heels \u2013 and I stepped confidently into the room. The first person I saw shouted: \u201cHi Grandma!\u201d I had to stop myself from slapping him. I was totally up for the love of this new being in my life, but I was by no means ready for the new status of grandmother. It forced me to re-evaluate how I saw myself; how to reconfigure my relationship with my daughter to allow her the space to be the mother she needed to be \u2013 and work out what kind of grandmother I was. And, of course, there were my issues around ageing. I\u2019d seen other phases of my life as a development, but for me being a grandmother brought up images of grey-haired old women on the slippery slope to death. I wanted to avoid it \u2013 anti-ageing being the operative word. But I couldn\u2019t. I had to face the discomfort, the siren call of change, and do the work of change. I needed the courage and endurance to actively adapt, allowing the pull and push of expanding to love anew while facing the challenge of letting go. It meant I had to let the anxious feelings run through my body, rather than cut them off with busyness, which is my most common defence. I often think of it like the weather: I needed to let the storm run through my system, while supporting myself by a process of talking, crying and running to reduce the stressors charging around my body. Then choosing to do things that comforted me: cosy TV viewing, hugs, meditation, delicious food. My experience felt unique and somehow unfamiliar, but research shows that change \u2013 either through choice, external events or developmentally \u2013 occurs every seven to 10 years. Yes the seven-year itch is true. It is important to set it in the context that there has been more societal change in the past 50 years than ever before. Boundaries are more fluid in work, love, health, sexuality, gender, identity and religion. I couldn\u2019t look at my mother and see her as a road map of how I wanted to be as a grandmother. I had more choices, which should have been exciting, but actually felt overwhelming. Life is change, I know it, and yet my experience, as it is for others, was trickier than I expected, and I assumed I must be doing it wrong. I have been a psychotherapist for 30 years and every person who has walked through my door has had a problematic relationship with change. It could be that they hated not having control over the circumstances that had been forced on them, or they were furious with their emotional self for not catching up and chiming with their new job, role or status. Confusion triggered by anxiety was their first response: the external event was easy to describe, but making sense of how they felt was not. They usually blocked the pain by shutting down, but when they blocked one end of their emotional spectrum, they also blocked the other \u2013 their capacity to feel joy. They had to open themselves up to their full experience and recognise they couldn\u2019t fix it or will it to be different. Our work was to examine their conflicting thoughts, support them to express their feelings, bring to the surface what might be hidden and help them come to accept it \u2013 until there came a moment when they realised they had integrated the change. The process requires patience and commitment \u2013 it can take up to a year, or more. Whether the changes feel like success or failure, the key is to learn from them \u2013 for that is how we expand and grow through our life. When we resist change we have worse outcomes. The evidence is unequivocal. Those who resist change suffer more when change is forced on them \u2013 and have less joy and less success in life. At the heart of change is identity. When someone asks themselves who am I, it is through identity that they find their answers. A cohesive sense of identity is fundamental to our mental health, and if there is a clash with who we know we are and who we think we should be, we suffer. One of my clients, Owen, was struggling with his identity. He was 22 and had been having a difficult time since coming out at university. He\u2019d begun to question everything and started to feel uneasy and awkward around people who had previously been his bedrock. \u201cWhen I came out,\u201d he told me, \u201cthat pretty much changed my entire life. Not necessarily for the better. Of course for the better in the round, but my comfort blanket, my confidence, my sense of belonging, were flicked away.\u201d It became clear that two parts of him clashed: the conventional part, which wanted to belong to the majority, and the gay part, which in some ways liked being different, but didn\u2019t know how to live fully in its gay self. The two parts didn\u2019t converse. As he talked to me he was talking to himself. He began to see where the source of his pain was. He realised that at the heart of identity is the need to love and belong, and for that he needed to allow this emerging identity to thrive. Another client, Cindy, lost her job and found that she had never examined her beliefs about herself, saying: \u201cI\u2019m a loser.\u201d She went on a roller coaster of anxiety, as most people who face change do. Anxiety is a form of energy that forces us to adjust, informing us we have to shift our role, behaviour or view.

Two black men are living rough on a street corner in an unnamed American city. They have nothing but each other: their bodies and their voices.</p> <p>Destitution, struggle and persecution are the themes of American playwright <a href=\"http://antoinettenwandu.com/bio\" title=\"\">Antoinette Nwandu</a>\u2019s powerful, entertaining and desolating 2017 play, indebted to Beckett\u2019s <em>Waiting for Godot</em> and drawing on the Book of Exodus. The evening begins with Kitch (Gershwyn Eustache Jnr) waking Moses (Paapa Essiedu), who has been supine on the ground, and giving him a colossal fright. The men\u2019s laughter fills the air, passes the time. \u201cWhat you fix to do today?\u201d asks Kitch. \u201cBig old plans,\u201d replies Moses, \u201cto rise up to my full potential\u2026 you feel me?\u201d</p> <p>Essiedu rises up to his full potential: light on his feet one moment, walking as if his boots were filled with lead the next. Eustache Jnr as Kitch is tremendous too. Watching him dream aloud about caviar on toast \u2013 spreading the word \u201ccaviar\u201d as if each syllable could be savoured \u2013 is one of many minutely realised entertainments in this meticulously physical show, superbly directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/15/indhu-rubasingham-tricycle-theatre-invisible-hand-interview\" title=\"\">Indhu Rubasingham</a>. Spike Lee <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/detail/B07C6562C2\" title=\"\">made a film</a> of <em>Pass Over</em> in 2018, but the piece is ideally suited to the theatre. And Robert Jones\u2019s ingenious design offsets required roadside bleakness with discreet wit. A pedestrian-crossing signal \u2013 a hand that switches colour between red and white \u2013 offers its own winking commentary.</p> <p>Out of nowhere, a white man shows up with a picnic hamper. Alexander Eliot cuts a hilariously disconcerting figure as Mister. He has a cartoon naivety \u2013 his body language is a hoot. But is he for real? Moses looks menacingly languid while Mister unpacks his basket and Kitch rapturously helps himself. It is only when the same actor (Eliot) reappears as a policeman that we have the picnic rug pulled out from under us. The unnerving likelihood seems to be that the white man\u2019s benign act was a mirage.</p> <p>This play, originally staged in Chicago by the <a href=\"https://www.steppenwolf.org/\" title=\"\">Steppenwolf</a> company, caused controversy when an American critic suggested the brutality of the white policeman was a racist slur. But Nwandu\u2019s understanding of racism, her ironic exploration of language as a racial weapon, is brilliantly nuanced. And I do not understand how anyone could quarrel with the message implied and delivered by gunfire: stop the random killing of black men. And yet, at the same time, she encourages the audience to dream of the day when a play such as hers might be rewritten in hope.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.riversidestudios.co.uk/book/love-loss-chianti\" title=\"\">Love, Loss &amp; Chianti</a></strong> (which I saw in preview) is a new two-part dramatisation by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/28/christopher-reid-life-in-writing\" title=\"\">Christopher Reid</a> of his celebrated poems. The first half, <em>The Scattering</em>, is about the life and death of his wife, Lucinda (it won the 2009 Costa prize). The second is <em>The Song of Lunch</em>, which was made into a BBC film in the same year, <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">starring Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman</a>. At one point in <em>The Scattering</em>, Reid refers to his \u201ccumbersome retrospective mood\u201d, and although there is nothing cumbersome about his writing, it proves a bordering-on-impossible task for director Jason Morell to make retrospection theatrical (even if Lucinda was an actress). <em>The Scattering</em> comes across as a poetry-reading struggling to become a play \u2013 a half-baked metamorphosis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20565de25c4512f129f7976869d9039717f88ecc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20565de25c4512f129f7976869d9039717f88ecc/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Johnson and Robert Bathurst in Love, Loss &amp; Chianti.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Johnson and Robert Bathurst in Love, Loss &amp; Chianti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Harvey-Brown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robert Bathurst looks mournfully dashing in possession of a red silk scarf and all his lines (a feat \u2013 he\u2019s speaking for almost two hours). With Rebecca Johnson, a bright-eyed presence, he does his bereft best to honour the text. But there is a difficulty about what they should be doing with their bodies. On the page, past and present effortlessly combine. On stage, what is said often seems unfastened from what is being done.</p> <p>The show is not helped by Charles Peattie\u2019s animated playschool projections that, although skilfully executed, fail to illuminate Reid\u2019s writing (except in illustrating the line from <em>The Song of Lunch</em> about being \u201con the edge of a shadow world\u201d). A more literal homage might have worked better \u2013 ideally including Lucinda\u2019s homemade Turkish trousers (as described in the poem) and all the frumpy details of the revamped Italian restaurant in Soho where the poet meets his old flame. But at least because <em>The Song of Lunch</em> is more theatrical than <em>The Scattering</em>; it is more comfortable to watch. And you can see Bathurst exulting in the poem\u2019s has-been lyricism, entertaining self-pity and ruthless decanting of the past.</p> <p>In G\u00fcnter Grass\u2019s classic postwar novel <strong><a href=\"https://www.thecoronettheatre.com/whats-on/the-tin-drum/\" title=\"\">The Tin Drum</a></strong> (1959), retrospection serves the theatre better. This fantastical epic is not obvious material for a one-man show, which makes the achievement of Berliner Ensemble director/adapter <a href=\"https://www.berliner-ensemble.de/oliver-reese\" title=\"\">Oliver Reese</a> and actor <a href=\"https://www.berliner-ensemble.de/en/nico-holonics\" title=\"\">Nico Holonics</a> all the more staggering. The evening intends to disturb \u2013 and it does. Holonics, in a tour-de-force performance, creates the world of a boy who decides against growing up. Two hours in the company of this arrested character is demanding and scary. Being in the audience is like doing a nightmare babysit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"878818981213e326c1b44f02faadf6fc350fa593\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/878818981213e326c1b44f02faadf6fc350fa593/0_0_4565_3162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nico Holonics in The Tin Drum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A tour-de-force performance\u2019: Nico Holonics in The Tin Drum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the image of Oskar Matzerath dressed up in lederhosen and harlequin knee socks strutting his way through brattish monologues is unforgettable. Holonics often lowers his voice to an obnoxious hush. His gap-toothed laugh is mirthless. His scream famously shatters glass. There is nothing cute about his cutsie way of waving goodbye \u2013 he contaminates childhood, he scorns it. On the wilder shores of his reminiscences he shares a traumatised world in which eels are drawn forth from the dead heads of horses and oral sex is described as a guzzling of vanilla \u2013 confectioner\u2019s porn \u2013 and in which fascism rules. He is a lethally unconscientious objector. At times, all the dysfunctionality of the 20th century seems to move through this lonely drummer boy whose drumming is, as often as not, in his head.</p> <p>Temi Wilkey, in her debut, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/event/the-high-table/?gclid=CjwKCAiA7t3yBRADEiwA4GFlI4BcPj60-lmQMjn-yTla5SLFT_cnn8nXfuvCPCDwaaa4MQdgNZtN7hoCuD8QAvD_BwE#anchor-personnel\" title=\"\">The High Table</a></strong>, brings us light relief. She approaches the subject of gay marriage between Nigerian women \u2013 and the traditional opposition to it \u2013 with unpushy intelligence. Her idea of getting the ancestors in on the act is a brainwave \u2013 their wrangling makes enjoyable theatre. Her subplot in which Uncle Teju (Stefan Adegbola) is persecuted for being a gay man in Lagos is particularly moving. The play is shaggy in parts and Daniel Bailey\u2019s exuberant production could do with trimming. But this show, with its terrific cast, lifts the heart. And <a href=\"http://www.mohamed-gueye.com/?page_id=10\" title=\"\">Mohamed Gueye</a>\u2019s astonishing drumming alone (the second drummer of the week) makes it worth getting a seat at this table.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4f735c692e85377b727d6a8fe40f1045b061029\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4f735c692e85377b727d6a8fe40f1045b061029/0_0_4437_2564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Webber (Segun), Jumoke Fashola (Mosun), Stefan Adegbola (Teju) and Ibinabo Jack (Leah) in The High Table at the Bush theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"578\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Webber (Segun), Jumoke Fashola (Mosun), Stefan Adegbola (Teju) and Ibinabo Jack (Leah) in The High Table at the Bush theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)</em><br><em>Pass Over</em> \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br><em>Love, Loss &amp; Chianti</em> \u2605\u2605<br><em>The Tin Drum </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br><em>The High Table</em> \u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://kilntheatre.com/whats-on/pass-over/?gclid=CjwKCAiA7t3yBRADEiwA4GFlI4aggZucMdXGgCUWSFbRdmkwsd_CL7ip7zFqa6wdKgbFV7eizwrM7hoCmm8QAvD_BwE\" title=\"\">Pass Over</a> is at the Kiln, London, until 21 March; <a href=\"https://www.riversidestudios.co.uk/book/love-loss-chianti\" title=\"\">Love, Loss &amp; Chianti </a>is at the Riverside Studios, London, until 17 May; <a href=\"https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/event/the-high-table/?gclid=CjwKCAiA7t3yBRADEiwA4GFlI4BcPj60-lmQMjn-yTla5SLFT_cnn8nXfuvCPCDwaaa4MQdgNZtN7hoCuD8QAvD_BwE#anchor-personnel\" title=\"\">The High Table</a> is at the Bush, London, until 21 March</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pass Over is a parable for all time: it is, according to a stage direction, set in 1855, the 13th century BC and \u201cright now\u201d. Two black men are living rough on a street corner in an unnamed American city. They have nothing but each other: their bodies and their voices. Destitution, struggle and persecution are the themes of American playwright Antoinette Nwandu\u2019s powerful, entertaining and desolating 2017 play, indebted to Beckett\u2019s Waiting for Godot and drawing on the Book of Exodus. The evening begins with Kitch (Gershwyn Eustache Jnr) waking Moses (Paapa Essiedu), who has been supine on the ground, and giving him a colossal fright. The men\u2019s laughter fills the air, passes the time. \u201cWhat you fix to do today?\u201d asks Kitch. \u201cBig old plans,\u201d replies Moses, \u201cto rise up to my full potential\u2026 you feel me?\u201d Essiedu rises up to his full potential: light on his feet one moment, walking as if his boots were filled with lead the next. Eustache Jnr as Kitch is tremendous too. Watching him dream aloud about caviar on toast \u2013 spreading the word \u201ccaviar\u201d as if each syllable could be savoured \u2013 is one of many minutely realised entertainments in this meticulously physical show, superbly directed by Indhu Rubasingham. Spike Lee made a film of Pass Over in 2018, but the piece is ideally suited to the theatre. And Robert Jones\u2019s ingenious design offsets required roadside bleakness with discreet wit. A pedestrian-crossing signal \u2013 a hand that switches colour between red and white \u2013 offers its own winking commentary. Out of nowhere, a white man shows up with a picnic hamper. Alexander Eliot cuts a hilariously disconcerting figure as Mister. He has a cartoon naivety \u2013 his body language is a hoot. But is he for real? Moses looks menacingly languid while Mister unpacks his basket and Kitch rapturously helps himself. It is only when the same actor (Eliot) reappears as a policeman that we have the picnic rug pulled out from under us. The unnerving likelihood seems to be that the white man\u2019s benign act was a mirage. This play, originally staged in Chicago by the Steppenwolf company, caused controversy when an American critic suggested the brutality of the white policeman was a racist slur. But Nwandu\u2019s understanding of racism, her ironic exploration of language as a racial weapon, is brilliantly nuanced. And I do not understand how anyone could quarrel with the message implied and delivered by gunfire: stop the random killing of black men. And yet, at the same time, she encourages the audience to dream of the day when a play such as hers might be rewritten in hope. Love, Loss &amp; Chianti (which I saw in preview) is a new two-part dramatisation by Christopher Reid of his celebrated poems. The first half, The Scattering, is about the life and death of his wife, Lucinda (it won the 2009 Costa prize). The second is The Song of Lunch, which was made into a BBC film in the same year, starring Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. At one point in The Scattering, Reid refers to his \u201ccumbersome retrospective mood\u201d, and although there is nothing cumbersome about his writing, it proves a bordering-on-impossible task for director Jason Morell to make retrospection theatrical (even if Lucinda was an actress). The Scattering comes across as a poetry-reading struggling to become a play \u2013 a half-baked metamorphosis. Robert Bathurst looks mournfully dashing in possession of a red silk scarf and all his lines (a feat \u2013 he\u2019s speaking for almost two hours). With Rebecca Johnson, a bright-eyed presence, he does his bereft best to honour the text. But there is a difficulty about what they should be doing with their bodies. On the page, past and present effortlessly combine. On stage, what is said often seems unfastened from what is being done. The show is not helped by Charles Peattie\u2019s animated playschool projections that, although skilfully executed, fail to illuminate Reid\u2019s writing (except in illustrating the line from The Song of Lunch about being \u201con the edge of a shadow world\u201d). A more literal homage might have worked better \u2013 ideally including Lucinda\u2019s homemade Turkish trousers (as described in the poem) and all the frumpy details of the revamped Italian restaurant in Soho where the poet meets his old flame. But at least because The Song of Lunch is more theatrical than The Scattering; it is more comfortable to watch. And you can see Bathurst exulting in the poem\u2019s has-been lyricism, entertaining self-pity and ruthless decanting of the past. In G\u00fcnter Grass\u2019s classic postwar novel The Tin Drum (1959), retrospection serves the theatre better. This fantastical epic is not obvious material for a one-man show, which makes the achievement of Berliner Ensemble director/adapter Oliver Reese and actor Nico Holonics all the more staggering. The evening intends to disturb \u2013 and it does. Holonics, in a tour-de-force performance, creates the world of a boy who decides against growing up. Two hours in the company of this arrested character is demanding and scary. Being in the audience is like doing a nightmare babysit. But the image of Oskar Matzerath dressed up in lederhosen and harlequin knee socks strutting his way through brattish monologues is unforgettable. Holonics often lowers his voice to an obnoxious hush. His gap-toothed laugh is mirthless. His scream famously shatters glass. There is nothing cute about his cutsie way of waving goodbye \u2013 he contaminates childhood, he scorns it. On the wilder shores of his reminiscences he shares a traumatised world in which eels are drawn forth from the dead heads of horses and oral sex is described as a guzzling of vanilla \u2013 confectioner\u2019s porn \u2013 and in which fascism rules. He is a lethally unconscientious objector. At times, all the dysfunctionality of the 20th century seems to move through this lonely drummer boy whose drumming is, as often as not, in his head. Temi Wilkey, in her debut, The High Table, brings us light relief. She approaches the subject of gay marriage between Nigerian women \u2013 and the traditional opposition to it \u2013 with unpushy intelligence. Her idea of getting the ancestors in on the act is a brainwave \u2013 their wrangling makes enjoyable theatre. Her subplot in which Uncle Teju (Stefan Adegbola) is persecuted for being a gay man in Lagos is particularly moving. The play is shaggy in parts and Daniel Bailey\u2019s exuberant production could do with trimming. But this show, with its terrific cast, lifts the heart. And Mohamed Gueye\u2019s astonishing drumming alone (the second drummer of the week) makes it worth getting a seat at this table.

      "body": "<p>Tjinder Singh, the frontman of Cornershop, hasn\u2019t been home for nearly a decade. To get to Wednesfield in the West Midlands, you drive east out of Wolverhampton past the Slade Rooms, named after the town\u2019s beloved glam-rock band; along the dual carriageways that were never fully completed in the 1980s; then to a dilapidated high street, kept quiet by austerity and out-of-town retail barns.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother worked there,\u201d Singh says from the passenger seat, pointing out a rusty factory gate behind a scrappy field. \u201cMe and the other Asian kids used to play cricket there too \u2013 that\u2019s how everybody knew us.\u201d</p> <p>Then we\u2019re on the street where Singh lived with his late parents and three siblings in a simple, 1960s semi. Today a blue van is parked outside the garage where Singh and his bandmate Ben Ayres used to rehearse when visiting Singh\u2019s family (Ayres, driving our hire car, is also on the trip today).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Britpop wasn\u2019t half as big as they make it out to be. I mean, what group would say that they were Britpop? Not many.</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The house next door to Singh\u2019s, however, is a more arresting sight. An enormous George Cross flag hangs from the upstairs window, huge capitals in the middle of it, spelling out \u201cEngland\u201d. Singh gets out of the car, and takes a photo of it. \u201cBloody hell. Well, there we are then,\u201d he says, as we head down the road.</p> <p>With eight albums of genre-skipping, pop history-foraging beauty behind them, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/cornershop\" title=\"\">Cornershop</a> are one of Britain\u2019s most inventive bands of the past 30 years. Their best-known song remains the glorious, once-ubiquitous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM7H0ooV_o8\" title=\"\">Brimful of Asha</a>, which entered the charts at No 1 in February 1998, knocking off Celine Dion\u2019s <em>Titanic</em> theme song, My Heart Will Go On. Propelled by Norman Cook\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LBnMRWeV-E\" title=\"\">sped-up remix</a>, its success felt like a victory for the little guys in Cool Britannia, especially as it eventually went double platinum.</p> <p>Cornershop\u2019s ninth LP,<em> England Is a Garden</em>, comes out next week. It\u2019s a glorious affair, 10 years in the making, some songs inspired by Singh\u2019s Black Country upbringing, others driven, as always, by his and Ayres\u2019s love of glam rock, psychedelia and Punjabi folk and pop music. It\u2019s deeply political too, as all Cornershop\u2019s music has been. Take <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvdvaaEe7NE\" title=\"\">St Marie Under Canon</a>, their new single and the album\u2019s opener. To a bouncy Hammond organ riff and four-to-the-floor Motown beat, the lyrics reference armies approaching (\u201cthe march of black boots\u201d), the effects of Indian colonialism, and how the modern world further amplifies the echo chambers of opinion.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em>\u2019s photographer takes pictures of Singh and Ayres outside an atmospheric old garage at the end of Singh\u2019s road \u2013 a tree grows through its middle; old signs rust on the walls. It\u2019s near the cornershop where Singh used to buy bubblegum with his siblings. \u201cAnglo Bubblies, they were called. The shop\u2019s got a new front, but that\u2019s about it. I feel properly weirded out. It hasn\u2019t changed much at all around here since my childhood.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd8491ca79b4f14bb959831790eb427588d24abb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd8491ca79b4f14bb959831790eb427588d24abb/0_0_4334_2949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cornershop's Tjinder Singh and Ben Ayres photographed at an abandoned petrol station in Wolverhampton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cornershop\u2019s Ben Ayres and Tjinder Singh photographed at an abandoned petrol station near Singh\u2019s old home in Wednesfield, Wolverhampton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We decamp to the Dog and Partridge, where Singh used to drink in his late teens. (Elder Asians never did: \u201cWe were stepping out.\u201d) This Tuesday afternoon, it\u2019s full of silent white men cradling pints; a mid-80s pop compilation plays Sinitta\u2019s Toy Boy and Samantha Fox\u2019s Touch Me.</p> <p>We sit by the dartboard, and Singh orders a tuna jacket potato with chips. He\u2019s still reeling from seeing the flag. \u201cEverything goes back to Enoch Powell \u2013 that\u2019s Brexit stage one,\u201d he says. Powell was MP for Wolverhampton South West in 1968, the year of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/enoch-powell-rivers-blood-legacy-wolverhampton\" title=\"\">\u201crivers of blood\u201d</a> speech, and the year that Singh was born. (Singh\u2019s father, a headmaster back in India, had moved to Britain in 1965, working on the buses in London while retraining to become a teacher; Singh\u2019s mother followed with his older brother, before having him.)</p> <p>\u201cMy uncle was in Wolverhampton before us, and he\u2019d said to my dad, come here, it\u2019s all right. But my father said to me once: they\u2019ll not always want you here in this country. That\u2019s always stuck with me. And that\u2019s why our songs have always reflected that right from the start.\u201d</p> <p>Cornershop\u2019s story as a band begins at Lancashire Polytechnic in 1987, when Singh and Ayres were put in a house-share together. They formed a band called General Havoc (\u201cas a distraction to our very cold and damp living conditions,\u201d Singh says) before forming Cornershop with Singh\u2019s brother Avtar and drummer David Chambers in 1991 (they scaled down to a two-piece in 1997). Singh had grown up listening to Punjabi folk music (the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/cb0e3a7e-8b7d-43d7-857c-9dac9a570194\" title=\"\">Bhujhangy Group</a>, a popular bhangra band from nearby Handsworth, were a favourite) before being exposed to bands like the Smiths and the Stooges. Ayres\u2019s family had emigrated to the UK from Canada when he was nine. He fondly remembers a British uncle introducing him to Beatles\u2019 songs, as well as Otis Redding, Pink Floyd and Bob Dylan.</p> <p>By his teens, Singh was becoming aware of the Black Country\u2019s particular contributions to rock music too. <em>England Is a Garden</em>\u2019s first single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4Z9p1OLZxY\" title=\"\">No Rock: Save in Roll</a> (released in November), was a tribute to it, its bluesy stomp recalling West Bromwich\u2019s favourite son, Robert Plant. \u201cPeople forget he married an Indian woman from Birmingham,\u201d says Singh, \u201cwhich says a lot about where his music was going, and continues to go.\u201d Then there was the heavy rock that biker gangs from the Black Country adored: Singh remembers a neighbour being friends with biker types including Led Zeppelin\u2019s John Bonham. \u201cBlack Country music was stripped down; it was harder. All of these notes per second in music today doesn\u2019t make it any better. I mean, listen to Black Sabbath. They were so laid-back it was unbelievable!\u201d</p> <p>On No Rock: Save in Roll you\u2019ll also hear a discreet sitar; this musical synthesis is everywhere in Cornershop\u2019s back catalogue, a musical response, perhaps, to how difficult assimilation has been for them in other ways. In 1993 their first EP\u2019s lead track, England\u2019s Dreaming, injected indie with the spirit of protest, fusing lyrics from the Smiths\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjPhzgxe3L0\" title=\"\">Heaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now</a> and Public Enemy (\u201cI was happy in the haze of a drunken hour/Fight the Power!\u201d).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvdvaaEe7NE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MvdvaaEe7NE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvdvaaEe7NE\">Watch the video for St Marie Under Canon by Cornershop.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This protest was about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/17/morrissey-autobiography-hits-back-judge-nme\" title=\"\">Morrissey</a>, who had draped himself in a union jack at a Madness gig in summer 1992, when the flag was very much a symbol of the far right. He had also released controversial songs such as The National Front Disco and Bengali in Platforms, the latter addressing an immigrant to Britain wanting to assimilate (\u201cshelve your western plans/and understand/That life is hard enough when you belong here\u201d). Cornershop had also <a href=\"https://www.cornershop.com/tags/burning-morrissey-poster\" title=\"\">set fire to pictures of Morrissey</a> outside his record company offices around their EP\u2019s release. This was dismissed as a press stunt by some at the time, but given Morrissey\u2019s ramping up of anti-immigrant statements over the years \u2013 including wearing <a href=\"https://www.forbritain.uk/policy/\" title=\"\">a badge </a>celebrating the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/30/bigmouth-strikes-again-morrissey-songs-loneliness-shyness-misfits-far-right-party-tonight-show-jimmy-fallon\" title=\"\">far-right For Britain party</a> on America\u2019s Jimmy Fallon show last May \u2013 it now seems on the money.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s changed now is people have this phrase, and I think it\u2019s a lovely phrase, called \u2018white privilege\u2019,\u201d Singh says, looking back. \u201cThat\u2019s what Morrissey had, that ability to just continue regardless \u2013 Clapton had it too.\u201d He\u2019s referring to Clapton\u2019s drunken on-stage rant in 1976, saying that Britain was \u201covercrowded\u201d, and that his fans should vote for Enoch Powell. That action prompted the creation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock.race\" title=\"\">Rock Against Racism</a> (Clapton has since said he feels \u201cshame\u201d about those remarks).</p> <p>\u201cClapton then surrounded himself with black people, and now Morrissey\u2019s doing the same,\u201d says Singh, meaning Motown singer Thelma Houston, with whom Morrissey duetted on his recent single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cB93OUF_sA\" title=\"\">Bobby, Don\u2019t You Think They Know?</a> \u201cIt was hard for Cornershop to make our stand then, because we were pulling a lot of disparate things together.

Birmingham\u2019s Apache Indian was blending bhangra and ragga and getting hits. London\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/asian-dub-foundation\" title=\"\">Asian Dub Foundation</a> were music-paper regulars. The Asian underground scene was building (Talvin Singh\u2019s debut album <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/08/how-we-made-talvin-singh-ok-album-interview-mercury-bjork\" title=\"\">OK</a></em> would go on to win the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/08/1\" title=\"\">1999 Mercury prize</a>) and the BBC\u2019s Asian Network became a full-time station in 1996.</p> <p>Brimful of Asha\u2019s success still felt like a pivotal moment. Blending big beat, guitar-pop and tambouras, it propelled the names of Hindi film singers into the non-Asian British mainstream (Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi are mentioned on the A-side, as well as Asha Bhosle). It spoke of pop culture\u2019s potential to lift people away from the false promises of politics, and about national projects in India that displaced people (\u201cwe don\u2019t care about no government warnings/About their promotion of a simple life/And the dams they\u2019re building\u201d). It did not pass Cornershop by that the name Asha also meant hope.</p> <p>Today, Singh and Ayres hate how the rewriting of the 90s has become so rockist and white. The albums that most influenced them at the time included the Beastie Boys\u2019 <em>Ill </em><em>Communication</em> and Daft Punk\u2019s <em>Homework</em>, they say. \u201cAnd Britpop wasn\u2019t half as big as what they make it out to be now,\u201d Singh says. \u201cI mean, what group would say that they were Britpop? Not many. Like Pulp, who were seen as a great Britpop band \u2013 they would run away from it. In fact, they did run away from it.\u201d</p> <p>They don\u2019t think Britpop was partly responsible for Brexit, as critics including <a href=\"http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/2018/11/14/the-good-the-bad-and-the-queen-merrie-land-warner-music/\" title=\"\">Jon Savage</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/1997/2017/05/cool-britannia-where-did-it-all-go-wrong\" title=\"\">John Harris</a> have suggested; they agree that the 90s were a fertile time. \u201cBut it\u2019s very strange that that era has been redefined and rejigged as it has been,\u201d Singh sighs.</p> <p>The time immediately after Brimful of Asha harbours different memories for them. Ayres had two young children back then; he considers the band\u2019s 1998 <em>Blue Peter </em>performance as a career highlight (both him and his daughter, Molly, then five, got Blue Peter badges). Singh had a tougher time. His mother had died suddenly in 1996, which he wrote about obliquely on Cornershop\u2019s top 30 single, Sleep on the Left Side; he was still grappling with that loss. In 1998 he told <em>Select</em> magazine that the song was about \u201ctrying to be optimistic when you\u2019re facing that\u2026 nothingness\u201d. His father then died in 2001, a month before Singh\u2019s partner gave birth to their son (they now also have a daughter).</p> <p>Singh has lived largely in north London ever since, apart from a few years in his wife\u2019s native France. He thinks often about how different his children\u2019s early lives have been to his. He also worries about how politics will affect their futures. His main worry when we meet is Donald <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/05/donald-trump-acquitted-senate-impeachment-trial\" title=\"\">Trump\u2019s impeachment trial</a> which has yet to conclude. \u201cIt looks like he\u2019s going to get away with it. If that happens, that means he can\u2019t be accountable to anything. Blatantly twisting his own ambitions for re-election, coercing foreign nations\u2026 if we can\u2019t get him for that, then we\u2019re fucked. And if that happens in America, then I can only see England going the same way.\u201d</p> <p>Singh and Ayres were big Labour party supporters; in the 90s, Jeremy Corbyn was Singh\u2019s local MP. \u201cAs a constituency MP he seemed very good. Then he wooed people after Ed Miliband\u2026 but he didn\u2019t really say anything, and he did nothing.\u201d Singh has fewer hopes for Labour today. \u201cThey do fuck all. Forget Brexit: they couldn\u2019t even fight against austerity. It\u2019s a dead party, I\u2019m afraid. Really dead. And also the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership\" title=\"\">leadership campaign</a> \u2013 my God!\u201d Ayres is shaking his head, in agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s turning into a joke that will see them out of power for ever.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be53c4c8f13eb5f5ab5ff384179ac47f16e1c859\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be53c4c8f13eb5f5ab5ff384179ac47f16e1c859/0_0_2700_2678/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cornershop England Is A Garden LP cover\" width=\"1000\" height=\"992\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The 21st century has seen Cornershop make albums in their own time. Singh suffered periods of stress and anxiety in its early years, he says. Setting up a label, <a href=\"https://www.ampleplay.co.uk/about-us/\" title=\"\">Ample Play</a>, in 2009, has been helpful (it releases Cornershop\u2019s albums, as well other artists they love). Their last non-collaborative, original album was 2009\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/26/cornershop-judy-sucks-a-lemon\" title=\"\">Judy Sucks a Lemon for Breakfast</a></em>; <em>England Is a Garden</em> has been in genesis for over a decade. They named it that, Singh says, obliquely, \u201cbecause to look at things from a garden point of view is quite nice\u201d.</p> <p>We discuss the brilliant cover art \u2013 a neon-coloured, androgynous crusader staring out at us \u2013 and how the title suggests the growth and rebirth of disparate cultures. It\u2019s a fascinatingly multi-layered mix, designed to provoke thought and curiosity while the feet tap along, and the earworms wriggle in your head. All Cornershop\u2019s albums are designed to provide gateways into the rest of their catalogue too, Singh enthuses. Songs like gorgeous Highly Amplified (which blends Punjabi and dancing flutes) and the T Rex rush of I\u2019m a Wooden Soldier underline common musical themes. The rhythm of the opening riff of Cash Money, with delicious irony, recalls Brimful of Asha.</p> <p>Another song\u2019s title might make some listeners baulk. Every Time That Wog Army Roam, a radio-friendly romp about British-Asian people being followed by the police, follows five previous songs in Cornershop\u2019s back catalogue featuring the three-letter-word. \u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/13/australia.andrewclark\" title=\"\">that word</a> is when it\u2019s broken down, it\u2019s much more genteel: western oriental gentleman,\u201d Singh says. \u201cBut it\u2019s an anachronism. And it\u2019s loaded. By repeating it, we\u2019re reminding people about it. It\u2019s something that should be remembered.\u201d He\u2019s smiling, defiantly. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t just go away.\u201d</p> <p>Cornershop, brilliantly, also aren\u2019t going away. They did think about it a few years ago, then they realised something important. \u201cIt\u2019s not about being proficient, it\u2019s about what you can do with it, and it\u2019s the attitude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the ideas,\u201d Ayres adds. \u201cThe ideas,\u201d Singh repeats. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s no real cupboard we can be put in. We\u2019re constantly misfiled. That makes it harder for us. But isn\u2019t there something brilliant in that too?\u201d</p> <p><em>Cornershop\u2019s England Is a Garden is out</em><em> on Friday on Ample Play</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tjinder Singh, the frontman of Cornershop, hasn\u2019t been home for nearly a decade. To get to Wednesfield in the West Midlands, you drive east out of Wolverhampton past the Slade Rooms, named after the town\u2019s beloved glam-rock band; along the dual carriageways that were never fully completed in the 1980s; then to a dilapidated high street, kept quiet by austerity and out-of-town retail barns. \u201cMy mother worked there,\u201d Singh says from the passenger seat, pointing out a rusty factory gate behind a scrappy field. \u201cMe and the other Asian kids used to play cricket there too \u2013 that\u2019s how everybody knew us.\u201d Then we\u2019re on the street where Singh lived with his late parents and three siblings in a simple, 1960s semi. Today a blue van is parked outside the garage where Singh and his bandmate Ben Ayres used to rehearse when visiting Singh\u2019s family (Ayres, driving our hire car, is also on the trip today). The house next door to Singh\u2019s, however, is a more arresting sight. An enormous George Cross flag hangs from the upstairs window, huge capitals in the middle of it, spelling out \u201cEngland\u201d. Singh gets out of the car, and takes a photo of it. \u201cBloody hell. Well, there we are then,\u201d he says, as we head down the road. With eight albums of genre-skipping, pop history-foraging beauty behind them, Cornershop are one of Britain\u2019s most inventive bands of the past 30 years. Their best-known song remains the glorious, once-ubiquitous Brimful of Asha, which entered the charts at No 1 in February 1998, knocking off Celine Dion\u2019s Titanic theme song, My Heart Will Go On. Propelled by Norman Cook\u2019s sped-up remix, its success felt like a victory for the little guys in Cool Britannia, especially as it eventually went double platinum. Cornershop\u2019s ninth LP, England Is a Garden, comes out next week. It\u2019s a glorious affair, 10 years in the making, some songs inspired by Singh\u2019s Black Country upbringing, others driven, as always, by his and Ayres\u2019s love of glam rock, psychedelia and Punjabi folk and pop music. It\u2019s deeply political too, as all Cornershop\u2019s music has been. Take St Marie Under Canon, their new single and the album\u2019s opener. To a bouncy Hammond organ riff and four-to-the-floor Motown beat, the lyrics reference armies approaching (\u201cthe march of black boots\u201d), the effects of Indian colonialism, and how the modern world further amplifies the echo chambers of opinion. The Observer\u2019s photographer takes pictures of Singh and Ayres outside an atmospheric old garage at the end of Singh\u2019s road \u2013 a tree grows through its middle; old signs rust on the walls. It\u2019s near the cornershop where Singh used to buy bubblegum with his siblings. \u201cAnglo Bubblies, they were called. The shop\u2019s got a new front, but that\u2019s about it. I feel properly weirded out. It hasn\u2019t changed much at all around here since my childhood.\u201d We decamp to the Dog and Partridge, where Singh used to drink in his late teens. (Elder Asians never did: \u201cWe were stepping out.\u201d) This Tuesday afternoon, it\u2019s full of silent white men cradling pints; a mid-80s pop compilation plays Sinitta\u2019s Toy Boy and Samantha Fox\u2019s Touch Me. We sit by the dartboard, and Singh orders a tuna jacket potato with chips. He\u2019s still reeling from seeing the flag. \u201cEverything goes back to Enoch Powell \u2013 that\u2019s Brexit stage one,\u201d he says. Powell was MP for Wolverhampton South West in 1968, the year of his \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech, and the year that Singh was born. (Singh\u2019s father, a headmaster back in India, had moved to Britain in 1965, working on the buses in London while retraining to become a teacher; Singh\u2019s mother followed with his older brother, before having him.) \u201cMy uncle was in Wolverhampton before us, and he\u2019d said to my dad, come here, it\u2019s all right. But my father said to me once: they\u2019ll not always want you here in this country. That\u2019s always stuck with me. And that\u2019s why our songs have always reflected that right from the start.\u201d Cornershop\u2019s story as a band begins at Lancashire Polytechnic in 1987, when Singh and Ayres were put in a house-share together. They formed a band called General Havoc (\u201cas a distraction to our very cold and damp living conditions,\u201d Singh says) before forming Cornershop with Singh\u2019s brother Avtar and drummer David Chambers in 1991 (they scaled down to a two-piece in 1997). Singh had grown up listening to Punjabi folk music (the Bhujhangy Group, a popular bhangra band from nearby Handsworth, were a favourite) before being exposed to bands like the Smiths and the Stooges. Ayres\u2019s family had emigrated to the UK from Canada when he was nine. He fondly remembers a British uncle introducing him to Beatles\u2019 songs, as well as Otis Redding, Pink Floyd and Bob Dylan. By his teens, Singh was becoming aware of the Black Country\u2019s particular contributions to rock music too. England Is a Garden\u2019s first single, No Rock: Save in Roll (released in November), was a tribute to it, its bluesy stomp recalling West Bromwich\u2019s favourite son, Robert Plant. \u201cPeople forget he married an Indian woman from Birmingham,\u201d says Singh, \u201cwhich says a lot about where his music was going, and continues to go.\u201d Then there was the heavy rock that biker gangs from the Black Country adored: Singh remembers a neighbour being friends with biker types including Led Zeppelin\u2019s John Bonham. \u201cBlack Country music was stripped down; it was harder. All of these notes per second in music today doesn\u2019t make it any better. I mean, listen to Black Sabbath. They were so laid-back it was unbelievable!\u201d On No Rock: Save in Roll you\u2019ll also hear a discreet sitar; this musical synthesis is everywhere in Cornershop\u2019s back catalogue, a musical response, perhaps, to how difficult assimilation has been for them in other ways. In 1993 their first EP\u2019s lead track, England\u2019s Dreaming, injected indie with the spirit of protest, fusing lyrics from the Smiths\u2019 Heaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now and Public Enemy (\u201cI was happy in the haze of a drunken hour/Fight the Power!\u201d). This protest was about Morrissey, who had draped himself in a union jack at a Madness gig in summer 1992, when the flag was very much a symbol of the far right. He had also released controversial songs such as The National Front Disco and Bengali in Platforms, the latter addressing an immigrant to Britain wanting to assimilate (\u201cshelve your western plans/and understand/That life is hard enough when you belong here\u201d). Cornershop had also set fire to pictures of Morrissey outside his record company offices around their EP\u2019s release. This was dismissed as a press stunt by some at the time, but given Morrissey\u2019s ramping up of anti-immigrant statements over the years \u2013 including wearing a badge celebrating the far-right For Britain party on America\u2019s Jimmy Fallon show last May \u2013 it now seems on the money. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed now is people have this phrase, and I think it\u2019s a lovely phrase, called \u2018white privilege\u2019,\u201d Singh says, looking back. \u201cThat\u2019s what Morrissey had, that ability to just continue regardless \u2013 Clapton had it too.\u201d He\u2019s referring to Clapton\u2019s drunken on-stage rant in 1976, saying that Britain was \u201covercrowded\u201d, and that his fans should vote for Enoch Powell. That action prompted the creation of Rock Against Racism (Clapton has since said he feels \u201cshame\u201d about those remarks). \u201cClapton then surrounded himself with black people, and now Morrissey\u2019s doing the same,\u201d says Singh, meaning Motown singer Thelma Houston, with whom Morrissey duetted on his recent single, Bobby, Don\u2019t You Think They Know? \u201cIt was hard for Cornershop to make our stand then, because we were pulling a lot of disparate things together. We couldn\u2019t just say, look at his badge. Look at his support of Tommy Robinson.\u201d By the mid-90s, however, the idea of British music was changing. Birmingham\u2019s Apache Indian was blending bhangra and ragga and getting hits. London\u2019s Asian Dub Foundation were music-paper regulars. The Asian underground scene was building (Talvin Singh\u2019s debut album OK would go on to win the 1999 Mercury prize) and the BBC\u2019s Asian Network became a full-time station in 1996. Brimful of Asha\u2019s success still felt like a pivotal moment. Blending big beat, guitar-pop and tambouras, it propelled the names of Hindi film singers into the non-Asian British mainstream (Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi are mentioned on the A-side, as well as Asha Bhosle). It spoke of pop culture\u2019s potential to lift people away from the false promises of politics, and about national projects in India that displaced people (\u201cwe don\u2019t care about no government warnings/About their promotion of a simple life/And the dams they\u2019re building\u201d). It did not pass Cornershop by that the name Asha also meant hope. Today, Singh and Ayres hate how the rewriting of the 90s has become so rockist and white. The albums that most influenced them at the time included the Beastie Boys\u2019 Ill Communication and Daft Punk\u2019s Homework, they say. \u201cAnd Britpop wasn\u2019t half as big as what they make it out to be now,\u201d Singh says. \u201cI mean, what group would say that they were Britpop? Not many. Like Pulp, who were seen as a great Britpop band \u2013 they would run away from it. In fact, they did run away from it.\u201d They don\u2019t think Britpop was partly responsible for Brexit, as critics including Jon Savage and John Harris have suggested; they agree that the 90s were a fertile time. \u201cBut it\u2019s very strange that that era has been redefined and rejigged as it has been,\u201d Singh sighs. The time immediately after Brimful of Asha harbours different memories for them. Ayres had two young children back then; he considers the band\u2019s 1998 Blue Peter performance as a career highlight (both him and his daughter, Molly, then five, got Blue Peter badges). Singh had a tougher time. His mother had died suddenly in 1996, which he wrote about obliquely on Cornershop\u2019s top 30 single, Sleep on the Left Side; he was still grappling with that loss. In 1998 he told Select magazine that the song was about \u201ctrying to be optimistic when you\u2019re facing that\u2026 nothingness\u201d. His father then died in 2001, a month before Singh\u2019s partner gave birth to their son (they now also have a daughter). Singh has lived largely in north London ever since, apart from a few years in his wife\u2019s native France. He thinks often about how different his children\u2019s early lives have been to his. He also worries about how politics will affect their futures. His main worry when we meet is Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial which has yet to conclude. \u201cIt looks like he\u2019s going to get away with it. If that happens, that means he can\u2019t be accountable to anything. Blatantly twisting his own ambitions for re-election, coercing foreign nations\u2026 if we can\u2019t get him for that, then we\u2019re fucked. And if that happens in America, then I can only see England going the same way.\u201d Singh and Ayres were big Labour party supporters; in the 90s, Jeremy Corbyn was Singh\u2019s local MP. \u201cAs a constituency MP he seemed very good. Then he wooed people after Ed Miliband\u2026 but he didn\u2019t really say anything, and he did nothing.\u201d Singh has fewer hopes for Labour today. \u201cThey do fuck all. Forget Brexit: they couldn\u2019t even fight against austerity. It\u2019s a dead party, I\u2019m afraid. Really dead. And also the leadership campaign \u2013 my God!\u201d Ayres is shaking his head, in agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s turning into a joke that will see them out of power for ever.\u201d The 21st century has seen Cornershop make albums in their own time. Singh suffered periods of stress and anxiety in its early years, he says. Setting up a label, Ample Play, in 2009, has been helpful (it releases Cornershop\u2019s albums, as well other artists they love). Their last non-collaborative, original album was 2009\u2019s Judy Sucks a Lemon for Breakfast; England Is a Garden has been in genesis for over a decade. They named it that, Singh says, obliquely, \u201cbecause to look at things from a garden point of view is quite nice\u201d. We discuss the brilliant cover art \u2013 a neon-coloured, androgynous crusader staring out at us \u2013 and how the title suggests the growth and rebirth of disparate cultures. It\u2019s a fascinatingly multi-layered mix, designed to provoke thought and curiosity while the feet tap along, and the earworms wriggle in your head. All Cornershop\u2019s albums are designed to provide gateways into the rest of their catalogue too, Singh enthuses. Songs like gorgeous Highly Amplified (which blends Punjabi and dancing flutes) and the T Rex rush of I\u2019m a Wooden Soldier underline common musical themes.

      "body": "<p>The Labour party has always been a broad church made up of many political traditions: from trade unionists, to free marketeers, to radical socialists. With each leader the makeup of the party has changed composition, bringing in new members and shifting old alliances. The Corbyn years saw a significant sea change in Labour\u2019s internal politics, and the current leadership election is revealing new contours to Labour\u2019s internal topology. Most important, we\u2019re seeing the emergence of a distinctive, radical-left current that is democratic, green and internationalist in its socialist aspirations.</p> <p>Until 2015, there were <a href=\"http://nearfuturesonline.org/corbynism-and-its-futures/\" title=\"\">four main factional tendencies</a> in the Labour party: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_First\" title=\"\">\u201cold right\u201d</a>, the \u201chard left\u201d, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/soft-left-labour-splinter-party\" title=\"\">\u201csoft left\u201d</a> and the Blairites. The old right \u2013 rooted in local government and union bureaucracies \u2013 has campaigned against radical socialism since the 1940s. The political crises of the 1980s saw the Labour left divide between the hard left of Tony Benn and the soft left led by Neil Kinnock (and, later, Ed Miliband). The soft left wanted to update socialism for a post-industrial age, to expel Trotskyist factions from the party, and to make whatever accommodations it took to win elections. The hard left remained committed to the radical policy agenda developed in the 1970s, despite waning support for traditional socialism among the electorate. The Blairites, advocating free markets and globalisation, emerged as a distinctive section of the party elite in the 1990s, but never had an enthusiastic base among members; they always relied on support from the old right and the soft left to carry out their agenda.</p> <p>Under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, the lines separating these factions blurred and shifted. Several of his senior staff and union supporters came from, or maintained close links with, the hardest sections of the hard left, such as the tiny <a href=\"https://www.communist-party.org.uk\" title=\"\">Communist party of Britain</a>. But much of Corbyn\u2019s activist base \u2013 and allied projects such as <a href=\"https://theworldtransformed.org\" title=\"\">The World Transformed</a>, <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com\" title=\"\">Novara</a> and <a href=\"https://www.redpepper.org.uk\" title=\"\">Red Pepper </a>\u2013 have occupied a different political space: green, libertarian, pluralistic and democratic. This \u201cradical left\u201d has always been ideologically closer to the most progressive strands of the soft left (such as <a href=\"https://www.compassonline.org.uk\" title=\"\">Compass</a>), which in turn backed Corbyn throughout his leadership, even while more conservative sections of the soft left peeled away to back Owen Smith in 2016. The organisation set up in 2015 to defend Corbyn\u2019s leadership \u2013 Momentum \u2013 has always contained elements from all of these tendencies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/26/labour-leadership-keir-starmer-on-course-to-win-in-first-round-poll\">Labour leadership: Keir Starmer on course to win in first round\u00a0\u2013 poll</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fact, it\u2019s clear now that the old division between the soft and hard left has been giving way for some time to a new distribution of positions. While all three tendencies pulled together under Corbyn, the differences are becoming increasingly visible between the soft left, radical left and a new \u201corthodox left\u201d as the Labour leadership election progresses.</p> <p>Keir Starmer\u2019s success in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership\" title=\"\">the leadership </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership\" title=\"\">race</a> so far has been in winning the support of the traditional soft left, which still constitutes a large proportion of party members. Despite the failures of both Kinnock and Miliband, their default assumption remains that progressive government can be achieved by selling moderate social democracy to the electorate, led by a guy in a smart suit. At the same time, the old right and the Blairites have all accepted that, for now, they can only gain influence by backing a soft-left contender such as Starmer.

For example, the leadership of Unite and other unions have opposed open selections of parliamentary candidates, preferring to bolster their own direct influence over candidate selections, despite democratisation of the party being Corbyn\u2019s first promise to his followers, and Momentum\u2019s major demand.

      "bodyText": "The Labour party has always been a broad church made up of many political traditions: from trade unionists, to free marketeers, to radical socialists. With each leader the makeup of the party has changed composition, bringing in new members and shifting old alliances. The Corbyn years saw a significant sea change in Labour\u2019s internal politics, and the current leadership election is revealing new contours to Labour\u2019s internal topology. Most important, we\u2019re seeing the emergence of a distinctive, radical-left current that is democratic, green and internationalist in its socialist aspirations. Until 2015, there were four main factional tendencies in the Labour party: the \u201cold right\u201d, the \u201chard left\u201d, the \u201csoft left\u201d and the Blairites. The old right \u2013 rooted in local government and union bureaucracies \u2013 has campaigned against radical socialism since the 1940s. The political crises of the 1980s saw the Labour left divide between the hard left of Tony Benn and the soft left led by Neil Kinnock (and, later, Ed Miliband). The soft left wanted to update socialism for a post-industrial age, to expel Trotskyist factions from the party, and to make whatever accommodations it took to win elections. The hard left remained committed to the radical policy agenda developed in the 1970s, despite waning support for traditional socialism among the electorate. The Blairites, advocating free markets and globalisation, emerged as a distinctive section of the party elite in the 1990s, but never had an enthusiastic base among members; they always relied on support from the old right and the soft left to carry out their agenda. Under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, the lines separating these factions blurred and shifted. Several of his senior staff and union supporters came from, or maintained close links with, the hardest sections of the hard left, such as the tiny Communist party of Britain. But much of Corbyn\u2019s activist base \u2013 and allied projects such as The World Transformed, Novara and Red Pepper \u2013 have occupied a different political space: green, libertarian, pluralistic and democratic. This \u201cradical left\u201d has always been ideologically closer to the most progressive strands of the soft left (such as Compass), which in turn backed Corbyn throughout his leadership, even while more conservative sections of the soft left peeled away to back Owen Smith in 2016. The organisation set up in 2015 to defend Corbyn\u2019s leadership \u2013 Momentum \u2013 has always contained elements from all of these tendencies. In fact, it\u2019s clear now that the old division between the soft and hard left has been giving way for some time to a new distribution of positions. While all three tendencies pulled together under Corbyn, the differences are becoming increasingly visible between the soft left, radical left and a new \u201corthodox left\u201d as the Labour leadership election progresses. Keir Starmer\u2019s success in the leadership race so far has been in winning the support of the traditional soft left, which still constitutes a large proportion of party members. Despite the failures of both Kinnock and Miliband, their default assumption remains that progressive government can be achieved by selling moderate social democracy to the electorate, led by a guy in a smart suit. At the same time, the old right and the Blairites have all accepted that, for now, they can only gain influence by backing a soft-left contender such as Starmer. Nandy has pitched herself at times to the soft left, at times to the old right; and so has won significant support from neither. Linked to the leadership of unions such as Unite and the RMT, the orthodox left back Long-Bailey as Corbyn\u2019s anointed successor. Under any other leader, their influence will drastically decline. The orthodox left still basically wants to implement the Communist party\u2019s 1951 plan, The British Road to Socialism, with its vision of socialism being implemented in one country by a strong, centralised national government. They lean heavily towards a pro-Brexit position, while tending to interpret support for Brexit among working-class voters as incipient class consciousness rather than tabloid-inspired xenophobia. The radical left is still a very new, fragile and inexperienced tendency that has a long way to go before emerging as a mature political formation. It brings together the more libertarian strands of the hard left, the more radical strands of the soft left, and a new generation of activists from outside the traditions of the Labour party.

Relative newcomers Daisy Edgar-Jones (best-known as Olivia in <em>Cold Feet</em>) and Paul Mescal (making his TV debut) take the lead roles of Marianne and Connell, two very different teenagers who fall unexpectedly in love. It is directed by Lenny Abrahamson and Hettie Macdonald and adapted by Rooney herself alongside Alice Birch and Mark O\u2019Rowe. Amid the hype, the biggest question remains just how they\u2019ve turned Rooney\u2019s slender yet satisfying tale into a six-hour, 12-episode series.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Sky Atlantic has snaffled one of spring\u2019s most glamorous casts as Nicole Kidman, Hugh Grant and Donald Sutherland star in <em><a href=\"https://www.geektown.co.uk/2020/01/24/sky-atlantic-releases-trailer-for-the-undoing-starring-nicole-kidman-hugh-grant-edgar-ramirez-donald-sutherland/\" title=\"\">The Undoing</a></em>, a psychological thriller about a marriage which collapses when the husband (Grant), a successful paediatric oncologist, vanishes, leaving his wife (Kidman) to discover that little in his life was as claimed. It will air in late May.</p> <p>Finally, sex of a less glamorous kind as playwright Lucy Kirkwood, author of <em>Chimerica</em> and <em>The Welkin</em>, returns to Channel 4 with <em><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/press/news/channel-4-announces-cast-lucy-kirkwood-drama-adult-material\" title=\"\">Adult Material</a></em>, a four-part look at the British porn industry. With original star Sheridan Smith having pulled out with a scheduling clash, the role of Jolene Dollar, a mother-of-three who is the UK\u2019s biggest porn star, is taken by <em>I, Daniel Blake</em>\u2019s Hayley Squires.

      "bodyText": "Television Love (and sex) are very much in the air on television this spring as the much-hyped adaptation of Normal People, Sally Rooney\u2019s bestselling novel, arrives on BBC Three. Relative newcomers Daisy Edgar-Jones (best-known as Olivia in Cold Feet) and Paul Mescal (making his TV debut) take the lead roles of Marianne and Connell, two very different teenagers who fall unexpectedly in love. It is directed by Lenny Abrahamson and Hettie Macdonald and adapted by Rooney herself alongside Alice Birch and Mark O\u2019Rowe. Amid the hype, the biggest question remains just how they\u2019ve turned Rooney\u2019s slender yet satisfying tale into a six-hour, 12-episode series. Elsewhere, Sky Atlantic has snaffled one of spring\u2019s most glamorous casts as Nicole Kidman, Hugh Grant and Donald Sutherland star in The Undoing, a psychological thriller about a marriage which collapses when the husband (Grant), a successful paediatric oncologist, vanishes, leaving his wife (Kidman) to discover that little in his life was as claimed. It will air in late May. Finally, sex of a less glamorous kind as playwright Lucy Kirkwood, author of Chimerica and The Welkin, returns to Channel 4 with Adult Material, a four-part look at the British porn industry. With original star Sheridan Smith having pulled out with a scheduling clash, the role of Jolene Dollar, a mother-of-three who is the UK\u2019s biggest porn star, is taken by I, Daniel Blake\u2019s Hayley Squires. Kirkwood has said she\u2019s interested in exploring power structures and complicity in the workplace \u2026 so expect no easy answers. Sarah Hughes Books Two comic American writers, one new and one familiar from hit screenplays such as Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, are offering to help you through the spring with plangent tributes to the emotional clarity of a bygone era \u2013 represented in both cases by cinema. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has put a neurotic film critic at the centre of Antkind, his first novel, published by Random House on 12 May. The discovery of an unknown film masterpiece should change everything for this failing pundit until, of course, it is destroyed. At the end of the same month, Fourth Estate is to bring out debut novelist Simon Stephenson\u2019s Set My Heart to Five, in which an android is moved by watching films from the 1980s and 90s. The run of highly rated literature on both sides of the Irish border continues with Roddy Doyle\u2019s new novel Love, published by Jonathan Cape on 14 May. It starts with Joe and Davy reuniting in a Dublin restaurant to talk about their old but mislaid friendship. And one of them has a secret to share. Vanessa Thorpe Theatre You\u2019ll have to hustle to get a ticket for 4000 Miles \u2013 expect queues for day seats and returns to be, well, almost as long as the title. For many, the draw of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet making his British theatre debut will be enough to make it worth a shot. He stars in Amy Herzog\u2019s inter-generational drama, alongside the redoubtable Eileen Atkins, at the Old Vic from 6 April. Under Milk Wood meets Twin Peaks in a new musical comedy: Milky Peaks is Seiriol Davies\u2019 long-awaited follow-up to his hit 2016 show, How to Win Against History. That brought to life the story of a cross-dressing Marquess of Anglesey; Milky Peaks looks likely to have more eccentrics in its sights, being a \u201cqueer Welsh fable\u201d about tensions within a Snowdonian settlement nominated as Britain\u2019s Best Town. It\u2019ll be at Theatr Clwyd in Mold, from 20 March, before touring Wales till 9 May. Actress Kate Fleetwood \u2013 who\u2019s given very good villain in Medea and Macbeth \u2013 is surely perfect, terrifying casting as Cruella de Vil in a new musical version of Dodie Smith\u2019s 101 Dalmatians. Zinnie Harris\u2019s production arrives at the Regent\u2019s Park Open Air theatre in London from 16 May; expect heart-stirring puppetry, too, from Toby Oli\u00e9, who\u2019s worked on War Horse and Running Wild. Holly Williams Art The most anticipated show of the year, if not the decade, is devoted to Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-1654), Italian painter, precocious Caravaggio successor, fearless traveller and all-round heroine of art. Gentileschi painted women as strong as herself: Cleopatra, Lucretia, Judith cutting off the head of the despotic Holofernes. She is also the first woman to show herself, sleeves rolled, sweat on her brow, in the very physical act of painting a self-portrait. The National Gallery\u2019s show, opening on 4 April, will be a surprise from first to last, not least because many of the masterpieces have never been shown before in this country. From 2 April, meanwhile, the Manchester Art Gallery will be hosting Derek Jarman Protest!. Director, writer, set-designer, political activist and gardener of the shingle at Dungeness, where he lived his last years at Prospect Cottage, Jarman was one of the most influential polymaths of the late 20th century. From the great films \u2013 Sebastiane, Caravaggio, Jubilee \u2013 to the anguished self-portraits and righteous protest paintings, the designs for opera, ballet and the movies of Ken Russell, all the way to the enthralling diaries and sketchbooks, this show will present every aspect of his mind: Jarman in the round. Just as summer begins, the British Museum will plunge deep into the mysterious icescapes of the Arctic, where 4 million people still live in a culture shaped by the climate. From 28,000-year-old jewellery, discovered in newly thawing ice, to sculpted figures of men and dogs, walrus ivory needles, fur clothes and contemporary photography, this is a portrait of a society through the lens of time and weather. Expect the show, from 28 May, to be as revelatory as the museum\u2019s magnificent blockbuster Ice Age. Laura Cumming Pop Spring\u2019s seasonal pop uptick hits warp speed in April. Fresh as a daisy is Brighton singer Celeste, who \u2013 like Adele before her \u2013 recently picked up a Brits Rising Star award to add to her BBC Sound of 2020 accolade. This velveteen-voiced soul singer heads out on tour supporting Michael Kiwanuka in March, but she has her own short UK headline tour in April, taking in Glasgow (27 April, Manchester (28 May) and the Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, London (29 May). Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds\u2019 latest album, Ghosteen, is both a hugely affecting, once-in-a-lifetime record, and an album you fervently wish had never been recorded. A song cycle based on the death of one of Cave\u2019s teenage sons, this keening document of grief is playing arenas all over Europe. The UK leg starts at Birmingham Arena on 2 May and ends with two nights at the O2 in London on 14 and 15 May.

Actually mate, I had my dick up her arse! Living in close proximity to violent crime is the price Londoners pay for racial integration,\u201d it said, repeatedly. The speech was free, of its original context, and its original audience. If you accessed any media on Monday, you saw Toby Youngs, who isn\u2019t allowed to say anything, telling supportive journalists about his Free Speech Union\u2122\u00ae, a \u201cnon-partisan, mass-membership organisation that stands up for the speech rights of its members\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Ten years ago, I bought a box of earplugs. My partner occasionally snored and, at about \u00a312 for 200 pairs, it seemed an absolute bargain. That was more than enough for a lifetime of peace, surely? I ran my hand through the slippery packets of foam slugs; they were yellow and pink, like rhubarb and custard sweets. I felt like an earplug millionaire.</p> <p>The last time I put my hand in the box, I hit cardboard: a lifetime\u2019s supply of earplugs, nearly gone. There are rhubarb and custards under my pillow and in my handbag, in the pockets of every coat I own, in our vacuum cleaner, even stuck to my back as I blearily shower in the morning. I measure out my life in rhubarb and custard earplugs.</p> <p>My name is Emma and I have become a noise bore: a shusher, a tutter and a wordless fulminator. I Google \u201cabandoned croft, Hebrides\u201d regularly and spent months researching noise-cancelling headphones. I seriously considered trading my rhubarb and custards in for a \u00a3300 pair: \u00a3300 for earplugs! Barely a week goes by without me quoting the Road Traffic (Vehicle Emissions) Regulations 2002 at a driver with an idling engine, and I email Ian, the local council noise enforcement officer, more often than I email my sister.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been noise-sensitive for years. Maybe the seeds were sown in my first year at university, a stressful time, filled with harrowing sex noises and the Prodigy from the room next door as I tried to work or sleep. It might go back further: I went to a Quaker school with daily sessions of silent \u201cmeeting for worship\u201d, which left me with an eerie ability to sit completely still for hours and a craving for calm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0649cdeab00c55be062a3772491f00c1f00dc43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0649cdeab00c55be062a3772491f00c1f00dc43/264_452_3497_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Put a plug in it: \u2018A lifetime\u2019s supply of earplugs, nearly gone.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Put a plug in it: \u2018A lifetime\u2019s supply of earplugs, nearly gone.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, I lived mainly unbothered by noise for 12 years in a quiet Belgian suburb and when we moved back to the UK in 2018, to a more urban location, I wasn\u2019t worried. How noisy could a genteel provincial city be? Pretty noisy, I realised, with a sinking feeling, as we sat in our empty house the first evening after collecting the keys, listening to an unmistakable hen party soundscape of cackling and Beyonc\u00e9. Our street is full of restaurants; it\u2019s also the main route for students to and from campus. Then there are the rubbish collections: the thump-thud of late-night wheelie bins, dawn lorries with bleeping sensors and the soul-wracking cacophony of containers of glass being emptied. When the sleepy pub opposite put up a sign declaring it was now a \u201cPolish Vodka Karaoke Bar\u201d it seemed like bad news, and indeed, it was. That was when the earplug reserve started to drain alarmingly.</p> <p>Don\u2019t move to a city centre if you can\u2019t hack noise, you may think, quite rightly. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what Ian thinks every time I send him a 5am video of a reversing bin lorry. But these aren\u2019t (just) the ravings of an angry, middle-aged woman. I have become increasingly aware of how far from alone I am in my obsession. I\u2019m part of a huge community of people who want everything to just\u2026 pipe down.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The sleepy pub opposite has rebranded as a\u00a0\u2018Polish Vodka Karaoke Bar\u2019. It seems like bad news\u2026</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not new. London noise inspired an 1856 editorial in the <em>Times </em>bemoaning the \u201cnoisy, dizzy, scatterbrained atmosphere\u201d. Nineteenth-century historian Thomas Carlyle was famously infuriated by noise at his home in Chelsea, including crowing cockerels and an organ grinder. \u201cThe question arises whether to go out and if not assassinate him, call the Police upon him.\u201d </p> <p>National Trust founder Octavia Hill wrote passionately in the 1880s of the universal need for silence, space and air, allowing \u201cthat sense of quiet which whispers of better things come to us gently\u201d.</p> <p>But that \u201csense of quiet\u201d seems impossible to achieve now. We live in high-density housing in urban centres, where we are prey to sirens, engines and extractor fans. We travel on trains and buses at the mercy of other people\u2019s digestion, openly broadcasted music (\u201csodcasting\u201d) and phone calls. We work in open-plan spaces, sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with coughers, pen tappers, desk diners and obnoxious conference callers.</p> <p>Actual loud noise is unequivocally bad for us. A World Health Organization report in 2011 estimated that in Western Europe alone, traffic noise results in the annual loss of \u201cat least one million healthy years of life\u201d. Reliable statistics on noise-induced hearing loss are hard to come by, but a 2011-12 study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that between 6% and 24% of American adults under 70 suffer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19e027004ba659887a34fcd0fa3a53debf1d8103\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19e027004ba659887a34fcd0fa3a53debf1d8103/0_132_3825_2296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Retro TypewriterManual Typewriter Circa 1970 with a blank sheet of paper and rejected work alongside\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Typists who bash their keyboards?

They are the day-to-day aural annoyances that loom disproportionately large. I work in a library most days and I\u2019m maddened by leaking headphones (I know one regular only as \u201cOpera Menace\u201d), people whose computers and phones have audible alerts, and what I think of as \u201cmainframe hackers\u201d \u2013 typists who bash hectically at their keyboards like hackers in 90s movies. Calm down, Alan, you\u2019re requesting a parking permit, not infiltrating the Pentagon. These ordinary sounds leave me impotently furious and unable to concentrate. A Twitter query revealed a chest-tightening list of noises that drive people to distraction and rage. Audible keytones topped the list, followed by sniffing, whistlers and bus eaters.</p> <p>Adverse reactions to these noises can be clinical. In misophonia, ordinary noises such as breathing, chewing or finger tapping trigger strong feelings of anger or upset. My friend Arianna is a sufferer. \u201cIt causes serious problems. My mum was here recently and I absolutely freaked out when she was trying to open a particularly crinkly bag of crisps. The rage just flew out of me and I yanked the bag out of her hands.\u201d Another poor sufferer tells me she couldn\u2019t even cope with the noise of goldfish picking up the gravel in their tank.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Headphones make me feel like my head has been admitted to a thick-carpeted VIP room</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Misophonia involves both neurological and physiological symptoms. In a study led by Dr Sukhbinder Kumar, a neuroscientist at Newcastle University, misophonia sufferers who were played \u201ctrigger\u201d sounds showed abnormally high levels of activity in the anterior insular cortex (AI), a part of the brain that is involved in both processing emotion and the \u201csalience network\u201d \u2013 whether and how your attention is directed to something in your environment.</p> <p>The AI is also highly connected to the \u201cdefault mode network\u201d \u2013 the region of the brain involved with memory and recall. \u201cWhen people with misophonia were listening to trigger sounds their past experiences, their past memories, were also affecting the way their AI was responding,\u201d explains Dr Kumar. (I\u2019m speaking on the phone to him from my stepfather\u2019s attic in the hope of quiet, but inevitably, his neighbours have the builders in.) Sufferers also showed increased skin conductance and heart rate \u2013 classic fight or flight responses, Dr Kumar explains (as the builders next door throw a chest freezer down the stairs and duel with pneumatic drills). The control group did not. \u201cWe were surprised by how clear the results were,\u201d says Kumar.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if I actually have misophonia \u2013 there are no accepted diagnostic criteria for the disorder yet \u2013 but research indicates that 20-40% of the population have a degree of noise sensitivity. \u201cNoise-sensitive individuals are more likely to report symptoms of inadequacy, depression, anxiety, sensitivity, anger, tension, inferiority and nervousness,\u201d says the same research, describing what I fear is now my whole personality.</p> <p>What help is there for the noise-sensitive?

      "bodyText": "Ten years ago, I bought a box of earplugs. My partner occasionally snored and, at about \u00a312 for 200 pairs, it seemed an absolute bargain. That was more than enough for a lifetime of peace, surely? I ran my hand through the slippery packets of foam slugs; they were yellow and pink, like rhubarb and custard sweets. I felt like an earplug millionaire. The last time I put my hand in the box, I hit cardboard: a lifetime\u2019s supply of earplugs, nearly gone. There are rhubarb and custards under my pillow and in my handbag, in the pockets of every coat I own, in our vacuum cleaner, even stuck to my back as I blearily shower in the morning. I measure out my life in rhubarb and custard earplugs. My name is Emma and I have become a noise bore: a shusher, a tutter and a wordless fulminator. I Google \u201cabandoned croft, Hebrides\u201d regularly and spent months researching noise-cancelling headphones. I seriously considered trading my rhubarb and custards in for a \u00a3300 pair: \u00a3300 for earplugs! Barely a week goes by without me quoting the Road Traffic (Vehicle Emissions) Regulations 2002 at a driver with an idling engine, and I email Ian, the local council noise enforcement officer, more often than I email my sister. I\u2019ve been noise-sensitive for years. Maybe the seeds were sown in my first year at university, a stressful time, filled with harrowing sex noises and the Prodigy from the room next door as I tried to work or sleep. It might go back further: I went to a Quaker school with daily sessions of silent \u201cmeeting for worship\u201d, which left me with an eerie ability to sit completely still for hours and a craving for calm. Nevertheless, I lived mainly unbothered by noise for 12 years in a quiet Belgian suburb and when we moved back to the UK in 2018, to a more urban location, I wasn\u2019t worried. How noisy could a genteel provincial city be? Pretty noisy, I realised, with a sinking feeling, as we sat in our empty house the first evening after collecting the keys, listening to an unmistakable hen party soundscape of cackling and Beyonc\u00e9. Our street is full of restaurants; it\u2019s also the main route for students to and from campus. Then there are the rubbish collections: the thump-thud of late-night wheelie bins, dawn lorries with bleeping sensors and the soul-wracking cacophony of containers of glass being emptied. When the sleepy pub opposite put up a sign declaring it was now a \u201cPolish Vodka Karaoke Bar\u201d it seemed like bad news, and indeed, it was. That was when the earplug reserve started to drain alarmingly. Don\u2019t move to a city centre if you can\u2019t hack noise, you may think, quite rightly. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what Ian thinks every time I send him a 5am video of a reversing bin lorry. But these aren\u2019t (just) the ravings of an angry, middle-aged woman. I have become increasingly aware of how far from alone I am in my obsession. I\u2019m part of a huge community of people who want everything to just\u2026 pipe down. It\u2019s not new. London noise inspired an 1856 editorial in the Times bemoaning the \u201cnoisy, dizzy, scatterbrained atmosphere\u201d. Nineteenth-century historian Thomas Carlyle was famously infuriated by noise at his home in Chelsea, including crowing cockerels and an organ grinder. \u201cThe question arises whether to go out and if not assassinate him, call the Police upon him.\u201d National Trust founder Octavia Hill wrote passionately in the 1880s of the universal need for silence, space and air, allowing \u201cthat sense of quiet which whispers of better things come to us gently\u201d. But that \u201csense of quiet\u201d seems impossible to achieve now. We live in high-density housing in urban centres, where we are prey to sirens, engines and extractor fans. We travel on trains and buses at the mercy of other people\u2019s digestion, openly broadcasted music (\u201csodcasting\u201d) and phone calls. We work in open-plan spaces, sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with coughers, pen tappers, desk diners and obnoxious conference callers. Actual loud noise is unequivocally bad for us. A World Health Organization report in 2011 estimated that in Western Europe alone, traffic noise results in the annual loss of \u201cat least one million healthy years of life\u201d. Reliable statistics on noise-induced hearing loss are hard to come by, but a 2011-12 study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that between 6% and 24% of American adults under 70 suffer. But the noises that most upset me are not physically harmful. They are the day-to-day aural annoyances that loom disproportionately large. I work in a library most days and I\u2019m maddened by leaking headphones (I know one regular only as \u201cOpera Menace\u201d), people whose computers and phones have audible alerts, and what I think of as \u201cmainframe hackers\u201d \u2013 typists who bash hectically at their keyboards like hackers in 90s movies. Calm down, Alan, you\u2019re requesting a parking permit, not infiltrating the Pentagon. These ordinary sounds leave me impotently furious and unable to concentrate. A Twitter query revealed a chest-tightening list of noises that drive people to distraction and rage. Audible keytones topped the list, followed by sniffing, whistlers and bus eaters. Adverse reactions to these noises can be clinical. In misophonia, ordinary noises such as breathing, chewing or finger tapping trigger strong feelings of anger or upset. My friend Arianna is a sufferer. \u201cIt causes serious problems. My mum was here recently and I absolutely freaked out when she was trying to open a particularly crinkly bag of crisps. The rage just flew out of me and I yanked the bag out of her hands.\u201d Another poor sufferer tells me she couldn\u2019t even cope with the noise of goldfish picking up the gravel in their tank. Misophonia involves both neurological and physiological symptoms. In a study led by Dr Sukhbinder Kumar, a neuroscientist at Newcastle University, misophonia sufferers who were played \u201ctrigger\u201d sounds showed abnormally high levels of activity in the anterior insular cortex (AI), a part of the brain that is involved in both processing emotion and the \u201csalience network\u201d \u2013 whether and how your attention is directed to something in your environment. The AI is also highly connected to the \u201cdefault mode network\u201d \u2013 the region of the brain involved with memory and recall. \u201cWhen people with misophonia were listening to trigger sounds their past experiences, their past memories, were also affecting the way their AI was responding,\u201d explains Dr Kumar. (I\u2019m speaking on the phone to him from my stepfather\u2019s attic in the hope of quiet, but inevitably, his neighbours have the builders in.) Sufferers also showed increased skin conductance and heart rate \u2013 classic fight or flight responses, Dr Kumar explains (as the builders next door throw a chest freezer down the stairs and duel with pneumatic drills). The control group did not. \u201cWe were surprised by how clear the results were,\u201d says Kumar. I don\u2019t know if I actually have misophonia \u2013 there are no accepted diagnostic criteria for the disorder yet \u2013 but research indicates that 20-40% of the population have a degree of noise sensitivity. \u201cNoise-sensitive individuals are more likely to report symptoms of inadequacy, depression, anxiety, sensitivity, anger, tension, inferiority and nervousness,\u201d says the same research, describing what I fear is now my whole personality. What help is there for the noise-sensitive? Ever obliging, end-stage capitalism has commoditised silence \u2013 Uber Black\u2019s \u201csilent driver\u201d option is just the creepiest manifestation. Silent retreats are the old-new \u201cmind hack\u201d for Hollywood and Silicon Valley A-listers, from Lupita Nyong\u2019o to Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey. There are even silent spas in Austria and Estonia. Then there\u2019s active noise cancelling (ANC) technology, one of the great technology success stories of the past decade.

      "bodyText": "So, another busy day of sport across Australia. Some key wins in the AFLW where Carlton have stunned the Crows, the Saints blew a huge chance to dent Fremantle\u2019s unbeaten record, while in Brisbane the Lions put on one of their biggest totals in recent campaigns. In the A-League a tale of contrasting games - an eight-goal feast in Geelong, as Western United banged six for the first time in their young history, while in nearby Melbourne a cagey one-nil was enough for City. City also won their W-League clash against the same opposition to finish their regular season unbeaten, while in the T20 World Cup, South Africa maintained their good form in Group B with a win against Pakistan. Big results from the WNBL and NBL as the Capitals and Taipans won finals-series games respectively. And that\u2019s Sportwatch! 90 + 3 min: Would you believe, the ball lands at the feet of Wenzel-Halls, open in the box, but the youngster dallies momentarily and is forced to lay it off. A City player challenges Muratovic - if he goes down, is that a penalty?! The youngster stays on his feet but he\u2019s on a different wave-length to his teammate and rolls an errant pass! And that\u2019s it - City claim the crucial three points, and Brisbane\u2019s fine run comes to an end; they\u2019re stuck, right back in the mix of a crowded A-League mid-table. A-League - 90 min: Four minutes is the added time, but you just get the sense this one is ebbing, gently, away for the Roar. A-League - 88 min: Goodness gracious, this is real ropey stuff from a team with aspirations for second place on the table. City are camped on their own 18-yard-box just backs-to-the-wall, booting clearance after clearance while Roar pepper the box with crosses and recycled ball ins. They\u2019re ripe for the taking - but Roar still have to work out how to. A-League - 83 min: Lovely work from Metcalfe who spins under pressure in midfield before lifting an instinctive ball over the top to find Maclaren. It lands at the feet of the prolific striker but his misses his control and Roar\u2019s skipper Tom Aldred, steps in to clear. And a final change, as Roar throw on the young striker Dylan Wenzell-Halls, he comes on for the right back, Hingert. A-League - 78 min: Side netting! Jay O\u2019Shea with a clever curling freekick effort around the wall - Glover scrambles, but it just flicks the outside of the net. Very, very close. They\u2019re in danger of inviting the Roar back into the contest, City - they kept them shot-less for most of the game, but they\u2019re letting them dictate proceedings late on. A-League - 75 min: And here come the firsts; a first shot on target for Brisbane (!) as McDonald forces Glover to scramble to claim a looping, deflected effort. And then a first booking of the evening - and it\u2019s the coach, Robbie Fowler on the Roar bench! Adrian Luna saves his blushes by picking one up on-field shortly after with a clumsy, rugby-esque tackle. This is now starting to warm up, this clash. A-League - 69 min: Well, that has to go down as one of the all-time most unfortunate substitutes - after six minutes of proppy limping Amadi-Holloway is himself substituted. On comes Mirza Muratovic in his place. Can the young Brisbane striker fare better? They still trail 1-0. A-League - 63 min: A first change for Robbie Fowler, who brings on a striker, Amadi-Holloway, for a midfielder, with Jacob Pepper to make way. Expect a slight tactical adjustment therefore. Oh dear, and inside a minute he\u2019s down with what looks quite a nasty ankle injury! It was an innocuous coming-together with Rostyn Griffiths - let\u2019s hope for Roar fans he can continue. What a blow that would be. A-League - Goal! Melbourne City 1-0 Brisbane Roar (Brillante) 55 min: The gods have heard our pleas, and opened their purse for one more offering! It\u2019s an incredible first-time volley from Josh Brillante lashing a looping headed clearance back with interest, and it clatters off the base of the post, and oh my, replays suggest off the back of the outstretched \u2018keeper, Young! It could be counted as an own-goal; how cruel against the man who\u2019s kept Roar in so many contests this season. A-League: second half! 50 min: Have the goal gods decided Western United and Central Coast used up all the vouchers? Are we destined for no more? The last time these two met they played out a thriller, so perhaps we\u2019re due the snore draw this time. Let\u2019s see. A reminder, for those craving more T20 World Cup action, we have a parallel liveblog for West Indies v England. It was the Windies with a very early breakthrough, ball in hand, but it\u2019s beginning to build nicely for England. Still early doors, mind: A-League - half-time: Melbourne City 0-0 Brisbane Roar It\u2019s even-stevens at the break, with not a whole lot of goalmouth action to speak of. City with the better chances, but Roar\u2019s \u2018keeper Young, as often, in inspired form. Roar not mustering a shot of target and it\u2019s a relatively frustrated Scott McDonald who speaks to the broadcasters at half-time. All strikers like to see a bit more of the ball, but as this one opens up that may yet happen. A-League - 33 min: My, oh my. Will there ever be a week when Jamie Young doesn\u2019t win \u201cSave of the Week\u201d? That was a superb header from Rostyn Griffiths who does well to generate the pace on the flick - but the big catlike paws of the Brisbane custodian reach out and bat it away. That looked destined for all money to be the game\u2019s opening goal! A-League - 25 min: So, let\u2019s turn our focus to City v Roar, where it\u2019s the home side defending a corner, but Glover comes and claims comfortably. They\u2019ve only scored one goal more than the bottom-placed Mariners, Brisbane - but importantly, they\u2019ve conceded 21 less. Expect this one to stay tight, before perhaps opening up in the second half - unless some of City\u2019s sharp-shooters like Jamie Maclaren have other ideas, of course. Perth came out of the blocks for a good, well, five minutes or so, but from there it was all Cairns. The home side delighting their fans with a big run of scoring late in the first to put a comfortable distance between themselves and their opponents. 85-74 the final score, Cameron Oliver with a game-high 22 for the home side, with the skipper DJ Newbill chiming in with 16 as well. An incredible 19 rebounds for Oliver as well - what a game he had. So we return to the West for game three. The opener was decided by just one point: who will have the legs in the final battle? They did the damage in the third quarter, but that was pretty emphatic stuff from the Lions across all four quarters, with 37 inside 50s. Catherine Svarc the standout with 23 disposals, 11 tackles and two goals. Wardlaw also with a double, with goals shared around elsewhere. They\u2019re one of two undefeated sides in the AFLW, the Lions - and guess what: they face Freo, in Freo, next week. What a game that will be. A-League - kick-off! So we\u2019re underway in the City v Roar clash - a win for Brisbane and they jump to just one point of three teams in equal second: including Melbourne City. A win for City, and they go three points clear of Perth and Wellington, ten points behind runaway leaders Sydney FC. It\u2019s a final-quarter demonstration of pure will from Kelsey Griffin as the Capitals come over the top of the flyers to bank game one of the WNBL grand final series. A remarkable match-high 12 rebounds, to go with 18 points and two assists - incredible hunger. Not that anyone was poor for the Capitals, with Kia Nurse bagging 19 and Marianna Tolo 15. The hot hands of Bec Cole running cold in the second half - she streaked to 18 first half points, but was kept to just five more in the back end of that one. A thrilling contest - let\u2019s hope for two more in the series! Now - we\u2019re also not too far away from our late A-League fixture, where it\u2019s Melbourne City hosting Brisbane Roar - the second game in an A- &amp; W-League double header; where suddenly points are key in a rapidly equalising middle section of the A-League ladder. And we are shortly underway at the T20 World Cup with another key Group B clash - where the big hitting Windies take on trophy contenders England. Don\u2019t miss a beat of that one, with our separate liveblog: Well they gave it a pretty good crack. Goes to show how important that final over barrage from Wolvaart was for South Africa - she took Pakistan for 14 including three consecutive boundaries, and that just about proves the difference. A touch sloppy in the field at times, South Africa, but credit the Pakistani batters for pushing that almost to the wire. Well, we prefaced this one as a must win (must-not-lose) - and haven\u2019t Western United done just that. A much-needed return to form for the mob from Western Melbourne after a bad run of results. They\u2019re right in the mix for the top six, but for Mariners. Oh dear. \u201cThat was a horrible performance\u201d, was the description from the broadcasters. Hard to disagree. So its the end the season for a bunch of senior Matildas as Roar\u2019s campaign ends in fifth place. For City it\u2019s perhaps the perfect tune up for finals next week - they\u2019ll face the Wanderers at home. A handy brace for US striker Ally Watt after Mijatovic\u2019s stunning opener. It\u2019s all purring nicely for Rado Vidosic\u2019s chargers - they\u2019ll be hard to beat over the next few weeks. A-League - Goal! Western United 6-2 Central Coast (Berisha) 89 min: And there it is - a 20th goal against the Mariners for Besart Berisha! It\u2019s not a fair fight, is it? This is another gutpunch for Alen Stajcic\u2019s men. \u201cA sad and sorry tale for the Central Coast Mariners\u201d is the assessment from commentary - you struggle to disagree with that. T20 World Cup: Pakistan 5/100 (18), Aliya 23, Iram 13 36 off 12 is the equation - you\u2019d have to say too steep for Pakistan, who\u2019ve done well to hang in this after the loss of early wickets. But, stranger things have happened in the short form of the game. Can Aliya be the Wolvaart for Pakistan? She doesn\u2019t quite have the levers, but one of the two needs to go big - and early. Now, we\u2019re also into finals season in the NBL and WNBL - and there are two key clashes going down this evening. We\u2019re at half-time in the WNBL where in game one of three in the grand final series it\u2019s the Southside Flyers leading the Capitals 47-43. Rebecca Cole with with a game-high 18 points for the Flyers. It\u2019s a high-scorer in the \u2018Nongs! In Cairns in the NBL it\u2019s the Taipans racing out to a 39-24 lead with three to run in the second quarter. Are they looking a little leg-weary the Wildcats? They did edge game one in a one-point thriller. Have Cairns responded better mentally in game two? W-League - Goal! Melbourne City 3-1 Brisbane (Watt) 69 min: It\u2019s a brace for Watt, and that surely is the ball game. They\u2019ve tried to stand toe-to-toe with the City XI, the Roar, but you just feel this one is starting to turn away from them. Might be backs to the wall o\u2019clock for the final 20 or so. AFLW - quarter-time: Brisbane 2.5 (17) lead GWS 1.0 (6) It\u2019s the home side in the box seat after goals from Catherine Svarc and Jesse Wardlaw, Rebecca Privitelli with the solo effort for the Giants. They scored first and haven\u2019t let up the Lions - 13 inside 50s to just one, so in that context the Giants defence have done well to keep the scoring as low as they have. A-League - Goal! Western United 5-2 Central Coast (Durante) 61 min: And we have seven! It\u2019s a scrabbly old goal. I\u2019m hesitant to claim another former Phoenix player, Andrew Durante, as the goalscorer - is this one an own goal off the thigh of Clisby? It was a lovely ball to the far post from Diamanti, and the veteran centreback challenged - and VAR has had to decide whether or not it crossed the line; the verdict - eventually - was, yes! W-League - Goal! Melbourne City 2-1 Brisbane (Watt) 55 min: Drama avoided, guys. Brisbane posed a question, and Melbourne City responded. It\u2019s a cheap one, in fairness, with the US striker Ally Watt afforded far too much room inside the box - but she spins well, and fires it home. W-League - Goal! Melbourne City 1-1 Brisbane (Palmer) 49 min: And after nearly 50 minutes Roar fashion their first shot on target, and would you believe it - it\u2019s a goal! They\u2019re right back in this courtesy Hollie Palmer, and you\u2019d imagine Rado Vidosic will want his side right back in the drivers\u2019 seat - given they have finals football next week and can\u2019t afford any switch offs. T20 World Cup: Pakistan 3-23 (8), Javeria 13, Aliya 3 And it\u2019s not started brightly in the run chase for Pakistan. They did well in the field but they don\u2019t have the answers for this South African bowling attack. Shabnim Ismail and Dane van Niekerk picking up key early wickets while Laura Wohlvaart has backed up her heroics with the bat, in the field, adding a run out to her achievements this match. Now - we do have a third AFLW fixture this afternoon/evening - so stick about for Brisbane v GWS. Plenty happening elsewhere, I\u2019m frantically looking to keep eyes across that as we speak. Here\u2019s a nice write-up in the interim about the earlier bushfire relief game in the netball. And what a fitting send off for a great of the game, Lisa Alexander: W-League - half-time: Melbourne City 1-0 Brisbane It feels almost a snoozefest in comparison across town, but maybe that\u2019s just the difference of two sides who actually know how to defend? When you\u2019re marshalled by former Matildas skipper Clare Polkinghorne that\u2019s definitely a factor. City enjoying the lion\u2019s share of possession, and they made that count through the Mijatovic goal. Her fifth of the season, and it might be hard for the Roar players to motivate, knowing their final\u2019s spot melted away 24-hours ago. A-League - half-time: Western United 4-2 Central Coast Bloody hell. I\u2019ve got about four screens going, and everytime I look back at this one I\u2019ve missed another goal. Okay - hands up: who had Max Burgess first-half hattrick in the office sweepstakes? He hadn\u2019t scored an A-League goal in 1,604 minutes, across 44 matches at four different clubs. And now he\u2019s got three. Gianni Stensness with his first as well for the Mariners. I quipped earlier that we could have another 7-goal thriller on our hands; well, we\u2019ve had six already - and it\u2019s only half-time. Oh my - can you believe this? Heartbreaking for the Saints, but halfway through the season Fremantle have plucked a fourth consecutive win from the heavens! Gemma Houghton with a critical point with just over half a minute to play - and fitting that in a low-scoring game just one solitary score would be the difference. They came from behind and the Saints staff will have a job picking their players up after this one. And this coming after a bad turnaround last week against the Demons. Yikes. A-League - Goal! Western United 3-1 Central Coast (Burgess) 38 min: And a latergram update, apologies for that from my end. Having waited something like 40+ A-League games before his first ever A-League goal, would you believe Burgess has struck two in about six minutes! And suddenly they\u2019ve got a mountain to climb, the Mariners. He\u2019s a player Mark Rudan has shown great faith in - not just at Western United but earlier at Wellington Phoenix. He\u2019s really established himself after years flirting on the A-League\u2019s periphery, Burgess - and so well deserved. W-League - Goal! Melbourne City 1-0 Brisbane (Mijatovic) 33 min: I was about to say an intriguing cat and mouse game across town at AAMI Park, but just as I was about to, it\u2019s a peach of a strike from the Serbian Mijatovic to light up the contest! She\u2019s left with too much space on the edge of the Roar box and she thumps a terrific curving effort top corner. What a hit, superb. A-League - Goal! Western United 2-1 Central Coast (Burgess) 26 min: Ach. It\u2019s a very poor giveaway from the Mariners inside their own box, and it\u2019s the former Sydney FC junior Max Burgess who capitalises! He had plenty to do, but he jinked, stood up his defender, before rolling past Mark Birighitti in the Mariners goal. And the goals keep coming! Are we on for another 7-goal thriller, as Western played out with Adelaide a few weeks back? AFLW - 3/4 time: St Kilda 2.4 (16) lead Fremantle 1.3 (9) Welly, well. Do we have a possible boilover on our hands? Scoring remains at a premium in Moorabbin but it\u2019s the Conference B leaders on the back foot, to a side scratching to keep their season alive. Watch this space for the final stanza. A-League - Goal! Western United 1-1 Central Coast Mariners (Harold) 19 min: Mark Rudan will be chewing wasps - having taken the lead, the Western defence has literally handed the visitors a lifeline. It\u2019s a clear as day handball inside the box from former Mariner Tomislav Uskok - and new arrival Chris Harold duly steps up and converts from the spot. Game on! T20 World Cup - end of innings: South Africa 6/136 (20) A terrific catch from Ali Riaz dismisses Chloe Tryon, but they can\u2019t slow down Laura Wolvaart, Pakistan, as she thumps three consecutive boundaries to bring up her half century and finish with a flourish and 14 off the last over. It was a decent performance from Pakistan - bowling was largely tight and the fielding of a high standard. Can they run down this imposing total though? They\u2019ll need almost 7-an-over. A-League - Goal! Western United 1-0 Central Coast Mariners (Berisha) 9 min: Who else! No A-League player has ever scored 20 individual goals against a single club -could the indominable Besart Berisha be the first? This is goal number 19, as the Kosovan leaps highest from a crowded pack to get on the end of Alessandro Diamanti\u2019s perfect set piece delivery. A fine header - Birighitti no chance. Evening all! A fine salutation to you, wherever around the globe you\u2019re following our coverage today. A fine thank you to JP Howcroft, as always. We\u2019ve got a stack of things just kicking off - chief among which a must-win (/must-not-lose) clash between two A-League clubs in freefall - Western United v Central Coast Mariners, and I was going to say a do-or-die finals-spots-on-the-line clash in the W-League, but unfortunately with Wanderers\u2019 win in the west last night Brisbane Roar\u2019s Matildas-laden squad have missed the four. Still, a tasty clash with premiers Melbourne City to enjoy. That\u2019s all from me for today. Time for Richard Parkin to cast his eye over the day\u2019s events. T20 World Cup: South Africa 82-4 (15 overs) South Africa are creeping towards a defendable total in Sydney but Pakistan have had the better of the first 15 overs of play. Javeria Khan has performed well deputising as captain in her 100th T20i. AFLW: HT: St Kilda 1.1 (7) v Fremantle 1.3 (9) - There\u2019s still not much scoring in Moorabbin but the second quarter at least witnessed a couple of goals with the Dockers keeping their noses in front of the Saints. Superbikes: Alex Lowes led teammate Jonathan Rea across the line at Phillip Island to make it a Kawasaki one-two in the Superbike World Championships. Scott Redding came in third for Ducati. WT20: South Africa 54-3 (10 overs) Marizanne Kapp (27*) and Mignon du Preez (17) have led a fightback from South Africa after Pakistan dominated the opening five overs, but du Preez will be kicking herself after losing her wicket off the final delivery of the tenth over, gloving a reverse sweep onto her stumps. AFLW: QT: St Kilda 0.1 (1) v Fremantle 0.2 (2) - Not much to report from Moorabbin where defence is on top at quarter time in the second AFLW clash of the afternoon. Rugby Sevens: A perfect day in LA ends in superb fashion for Australia who make it three wins out of three with a 17-7 victory over the USA. The Aussies will now go into the knockout phase tomorrow as winners of Pool C and take on Ireland in the quarterfinals. WT20: South Africa 17-2 (5 overs) Diana Baig is at it again! The Pakistan star has her second wicket of the match after Dane van Niekerk drags onto her pegs from wide outside off stump. WT20: South Africa 15-1 (3 overs) Great start for Pakistan in their must-win clash against South Africa with Diana Baig finding some away swing to tickle the edge of Lizelle Lee\u2019s bat, and the centurion against Thailand is out for just four. Marizanne Kapp, in a first drop, then lives dangerously, just clearing the ring in consecutive deliveries. Netball: Diamonds 66-53 All-Stars - There\u2019s hugs and smiles, singing and dancing, light-shows and confetti in Sydney\u2019s Qudos Bank Arena as the bushfire relief match ends with a resounding victory for Australia. Lisa Alexander\u2019s tenure as head coach ends in celebratory fashion with the superstars of netball putting on a show for a packed house. \u201cWe are the Navy Blues\u201d rings around Richmond Oval in Adelaide after Carlton registered one of the greatest wins in their history. Tayla Harris (2.3) starred as the Victorians celebrated revenge in a rematch of last year\u2019s grand final. The victory, Carlton\u2019s third in a row, keeps them towards the top of Conference B, while Adelaide remain mid-table in Conference A with a 2-2 record halfway through the season. AFLW: Carlton have stretched their lead to eight points with just a couple of minutes remaining in their clash away to Adelaide. World T20: South Africa have won the toss and elected to bat first in a crucial Group B contest. A South African win would put them in pole position to top the group heading into the semi-finals while a Pakistan victory would set up a final round free-for-all involving both sides as well as England and West Indies. Rugby Sevens: Australia\u2019s men have won their opening two fixtures - against Samoa and Scotland - at the LA Sevens. They now face a decider against the hosts at around 3pm to determine who tops Pool C. Superbikes: World champion Jonathan Rea has picked up where he left off in 2019, winning the second race of the weekend at Phillip Island, the Superpole Sprint. The Kawasaki rider prevailed in a nail-biter ahead of race one winner Toprak Razgatlioglu (Yamaha) and Scott Redding (Ducati) with just 0.072 seconds separating the trio after the frenetic 10-lapper. Race three, over 22-laps, gets underway at 3pm. AFLW: Midway through the third quarter of the grand final rematch Tayla Harris has just kicked Carlton 4.4 (28) a point ahead of Adelaide 4.3 (27). Netball: Early in the second half of this bushfire relief contest between Australia and the Super Netball All-Stars the scoreboard reads 47-29 in favour of the Diamonds. Lisa Alexander is being given a fine send-off in her last game as national team coach. Hello everybody and welcome to another action-packed Sunday Sportwatch. The line-up today could hardly be busier or more varied. There\u2019s Superbikes from Phillip Island, Diamonds v All-Stars netball, AFLW (Adelaide v Carlton, St Kilda v Fremantle, &amp; Brisbane v GWS), South Africa v Pakistan in the Women\u2019s World T20, semi-final action in the NBL and grand final tension in the WNBL, two A-League fixtures - Western United v Central Coast Mariners, and Melbourne City v Brisbane Roar, with those latter two clubs also clashing in the W-League. If that wasn\u2019t enough there\u2019s rugby sevens in LA, as well as preseason trials in both the NRL and AFL.

      "body": "<p>After a brief interlude during a trip back to Ireland, the boy\u2019s sickness has returned with a vengeance. We were called by the childminder to come and pick him up, because he\u2019d been sick again. It was worse this time, and our sense of distress was enhanced by the indignity of false hope, since our trip home had proved mostly painless. He now had a high temperature and a cough that could strip paint. The minor hardship we\u2019d experienced the week before appeared to have been little more than an hors d\u2019oeuvre.</p> <p>My natural refuge in any time of stress is the internet \u2013 eg five minutes ago when I couldn\u2019t spell \u2018hors d\u2019oeuvre\u2019 and Googled \u2018hrouresdearveses\u2019 \u2013 but this seemed like a better candidate for good old-fashioned, face-to-face doctoring. Besides, my wife and I are incapable of searching my son\u2019s symptoms without concluding he has coronavirus, so we thought it best that a professional decide.</p> <p>I raced him to the doctor, not so much out of urgency but because our appointment coincided with a torrential downpour. All of which he found so exciting he\u2019d forgotten he was ill by the time we arrived. This was not the ideal moment for me to be flustered and damp, and for him to be alert, smiling, and conspicuously lacking the cough he\u2019d had for the previous 12 hours.</p> <p>I was confronted with a weird sense of annoyance that my child seemed better. Some part of you fears the doctor will think you\u2019re lying or, worse, are one of those overbearing TV parents, cradling a perfectly healthy child and demanding someone donate an entire hospital ward to his care. \u2018Come on,\u2019 I thought to myself, my brave little soldier acting altogether too brave for my liking. \u2018Give us a few coughs, that\u2019s a good boy.\u2019</p> <p>Luckily, this is not how medicine actually works, and my doctor discerned the problem with that unshowy confidence they always have. I revert to childhood around doctors, happy for them to take control, to relinquish my adulthood entirely. I envy this of doctors most of all \u2013 to be an adult, a real adult, one who never Googles their ailments (or \u2018ourrsdeoeurvs\u2019), who spends their days helping people, putting them at ease, and in their downtime, doing that thing where they push themselves backwards on a wheeled chair so they can get something out of a sliding drawer behind them. There are, I\u2019m sure, aspects of medical life that are less fun. It\u2019s just I lack the imagination to consider them when I\u2019m face to face with someone who gets to have a life-sized plastic skeleton in their office.</p> <p>In the end, he diagnosed my son with mild croup and not the coronavirus I had promised myself I wouldn\u2019t talk about, but ended up mentioning several times. My son got a sticker, tried to eat it, and began crying as I fastened it to my own shirt instead. \u2018Come now, you\u2019ve been a very brave boy,\u2019 the doctor said. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 I replied, \u2018I have, haven\u2019t I?\u2019</p> <p><em>Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shockproofbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@shockproofbeats</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "After a brief interlude during a trip back to Ireland, the boy\u2019s sickness has returned with a vengeance. We were called by the childminder to come and pick him up, because he\u2019d been sick again. It was worse this time, and our sense of distress was enhanced by the indignity of false hope, since our trip home had proved mostly painless. He now had a high temperature and a cough that could strip paint. The minor hardship we\u2019d experienced the week before appeared to have been little more than an hors d\u2019oeuvre. My natural refuge in any time of stress is the internet \u2013 eg five minutes ago when I couldn\u2019t spell \u2018hors d\u2019oeuvre\u2019 and Googled \u2018hrouresdearveses\u2019 \u2013 but this seemed like a better candidate for good old-fashioned, face-to-face doctoring. Besides, my wife and I are incapable of searching my son\u2019s symptoms without concluding he has coronavirus, so we thought it best that a professional decide. I raced him to the doctor, not so much out of urgency but because our appointment coincided with a torrential downpour. All of which he found so exciting he\u2019d forgotten he was ill by the time we arrived. This was not the ideal moment for me to be flustered and damp, and for him to be alert, smiling, and conspicuously lacking the cough he\u2019d had for the previous 12 hours. I was confronted with a weird sense of annoyance that my child seemed better. Some part of you fears the doctor will think you\u2019re lying or, worse, are one of those overbearing TV parents, cradling a perfectly healthy child and demanding someone donate an entire hospital ward to his care. \u2018Come on,\u2019 I thought to myself, my brave little soldier acting altogether too brave for my liking. \u2018Give us a few coughs, that\u2019s a good boy.\u2019 Luckily, this is not how medicine actually works, and my doctor discerned the problem with that unshowy confidence they always have. I revert to childhood around doctors, happy for them to take control, to relinquish my adulthood entirely. I envy this of doctors most of all \u2013 to be an adult, a real adult, one who never Googles their ailments (or \u2018ourrsdeoeurvs\u2019), who spends their days helping people, putting them at ease, and in their downtime, doing that thing where they push themselves backwards on a wheeled chair so they can get something out of a sliding drawer behind them. There are, I\u2019m sure, aspects of medical life that are less fun. It\u2019s just I lack the imagination to consider them when I\u2019m face to face with someone who gets to have a life-sized plastic skeleton in their office. In the end, he diagnosed my son with mild croup and not the coronavirus I had promised myself I wouldn\u2019t talk about, but ended up mentioning several times. My son got a sticker, tried to eat it, and began crying as I fastened it to my own shirt instead. \u2018Come now, you\u2019ve been a very brave boy,\u2019 the doctor said. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 I replied, \u2018I have, haven\u2019t I?\u2019 Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats",

We\u2019ve now seen cases on six continents, apparently \u201csilent\u201d \u2013 that is, at least partly asymptomatic \u2013 chains of human-to-human transmission both inside and outside China, with additional countries reporting cases within the last week \u2013 bringing the total to 47 \u2013 and new, accelerating outbreaks in Iran, Italy and South Korea. If it becomes a pandemic, the questions are, how bad will it get and how long will it last? The case fatality rate \u2013 the proportion of cases that are fatal \u2013 has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/01/coronavirus-victims-profile-outlier-impact-cases\" title=\"\">just over 2%</a>, much less than it was for Sars, but 20 times that of seasonal flu. There are still many unknowns \u2013 we may have underestimated the period during which a person is contagious, for instance, and the variety of ways in which the virus spreads.</p> \n<p><strong>If the worst-case scenario comes true, are there still things we can do to minimise the pandemic\u2019s impact?</strong><br>Absolutely. We can mobilise more health officials and keep engaging the public, implementing sensible travel controls and ensuring that frontline health workers have ready access to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/nhs-to-test-londoners-for-coronavirus-at-home\" title=\"\">diagnostic tests</a> and are vigilant \u2013 that they don\u2019t send anyone who may have been exposed home without testing them, for example. Judging by past experience, however, it\u2019s likely that health officials and the public in much of the world remain unaware or unconvinced of the danger this virus poses.</p> \n<p><strong>You have said that time and trust are critical to good epidemic management. What do you mean?</strong><br>The delay between the frontline health workers noticing something unusual, in the form of an emerging disease, and that information travelling up the line to central decision-makers is critical. To illustrate that, a 2018 simulation that the <a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Gates Foundation</a> conducted of a flu pandemic estimated that there would be 28,000 deaths after one month, 10 million after three months, and 33 million after six months. The virus used in that simulation was more contagious and deadly than Covid-19 \u2013 though they are both respiratory viruses \u2013 but the example shows how all epidemics grow exponentially. So if you can catch an epidemic in the first few weeks, it makes all the difference. As for trust, it\u2019s critical to disseminate dispassionate, evidence-based information, and not to try to mislead the population. If you do, they will stop cooperating. Let\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t happen in China.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/02/corona-carousel\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Judging by reports, we\u2019re at least a year out from having an approved Covid-19 vaccine.

Since the creation of a much-needed public health emergency preparedness fund in the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447374/\" title=\"\">aftermath of 9/11</a>, its budget and the public health functions it supports have been steadily reduced.

None of the advances I\u2019ve mentioned could have happened without the WHO\u2019s involvement, but the WHO can only perform as well as its members allow it to \u2013 and they have pulled back on funding since the 2008 financial crisis. Your book is optimistically entitled The End of Epidemics. Could we ever really wave goodbye to epidemics?

Last year, 400 patients died while waiting for a transplant, and a further 777 were removed from the list, most of them because their condition had deteriorated to the point where they had become too ill to undergo transplants. The government has said that the new law could see up to 700 extra transplants a year by 2023. Experts, however, while welcoming the change, caution that the law in itself is not going to automatically solve England\u2019s organ shortage.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a silver bullet,\u201d says Professor Gurch Randhawa, a public health expert at Bedfordshire University. \u201cAs a society, we still need to do much more to normalise organ donation to improve consent rates.\u201d</p> <p>This is crucial, he points out, because the new system will be a \u201csoft\u201d opt out: as with the current system, bereaved families will still have the final say on their deceased loved ones\u2019 organs, and can refuse permission for them to be donated, even if they\u2019re signed up to the donor register. Currently, more than three families a week say no to organ donation because they don\u2019t know their loved ones\u2019 wishes \u2013 even though more than 80% of the population say they would definitely donate or consider donating their organs, according to NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT).</p> <p>Professor Ronan O\u2019Carroll, a psychologist at Stirling University, agrees that the law change is not \u201cthe simple solution it appears to be. Poland, for example, has an opt-out system and it has quite low organ donation rates.\u201d Besides, he says, there is concern that a small minority \u201cmay react against the new system and opt out even if they\u2019re signed up to the register, because if their consent is presumed, they don\u2019t see organ donation as a gift any more \u2013 they see it as government ownership.\u201d</p> <p>Both experts point to the example of Spain, which has the highest rate of deceased organ donation in the world \u2013 a feat often attributed to the \u201cpresumed consent\u201d system for organ donors it has had since 1979. Randhawa says: \u201cWhen Spain introduced the opt-out system, they didn\u2019t see any changes in donation rates for at least 10 years, because it took them 10 years to get the public education right, the hospital capacity right, the family requesting right.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, he is hopeful that the law will be a catalyst for change. Or, as Anthony Clarkson, Director of Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation at NHSBT, puts it: \u201cBy changing the legislation, we\u2019re encouraging people to make a decision about whether to be a donor and have a conversation about their wishes with their family.\u201d</p> <p>So far, opt-out has shown encouraging results in Wales, which now has the highest organ consent rate of all the UK nations, having climbed from 58% in 2015 before the law changed to almost 80%. This is not so much because of the law change in itself, Randhawa says, but increased public awareness, which is also under way in England thanks to a boost in NHSBT\u2019s budget to promote the new system \u2013 it has been given an additional \u00a310m \u2013 and the publicity it has generated.</p> <p>The media has a major role to play in normalising the act of organ donation, Randhawa argues, and should learn from Spain, where national and local newspapers regularly feature stories about donors and donor families, and rarely focus on transplant recipients. In England, the opposite is true, he says \u2013 stories of people who have had lifesaving transplants or who need them dominate donation coverage: \u201cThat sadly reinforces people thinking \u2018OK, I\u2019ll get a transplant if I ever need one,\u2019 [rather than seeing themselves as potential donors.]\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fc469614e2e4e9d08c65374a36bcacd8632cf5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fc469614e2e4e9d08c65374a36bcacd8632cf5a/0_81_615_369/500.jpg\" alt=\"Keira Ball\u2019s organs have been donated to four people.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keira Ball\u2019s organs have been donated to four people.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important, Randhawa says, that the new law \u2013 which was originally known only as \u201cMax\u2019s law\u201d \u2013 now carries the name of Max\u2019s lifesaving donor, thanks to lobbying by Max, his family and Keira\u2019s family.

      "body": "<p>To bring a book into the world with 1,065 pages, there has to be a good reason. Thomas Piketty\u2019s reason is that without a detailed account of the ideologies that have sustained inequality in the past, we cannot understand its present form, or how to overcome it.</p> <p>So <em>Capital and Ideology</em> takes us on a historical grand tour of the hypocrisy of elites, ranging from the punishments meted out to slaves in Mesopotamia to the cruelty of the Belle \u00c9poque, which, as French economist Piketty points out, was belle only for a small number of white men.</p> <p>But the main focus of the book is the present, which is marked by extreme and rising inequality, alongside the breakdown of traditional, class-based politics. The social coalition that drove redistribution in the mid-20th century has disappeared. If we don\u2019t do something radical to reduce inequality, Piketty argues, \u201cxenophobic populism could well triumph at the ballot box and initiate changes that will destroy the global, hypercapitalist digital economy\u201d.</p> <p>Piketty\u2019s 2014 book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/17/capital-twenty-first-century-thomas-piketty-review\" title=\"\">Capital in the 21st Century</a></em> showed how inequality is baked into our current economic model. In a free-market economy, he argues, inequality inevitably rises faster than growth. And as the incomes of the rich become reliant more on asset wealth than salaries, the old forms of redistribution, based on income tax and corporation tax, cease to work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Piketty\u2019s socialism is not just a socialism without the working class. It is a socialism without class struggle</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In this book, Piketty outlines his solution: a \u201cparticipatory socialism\u201d in which capitalism is gradually abolished via a progressive income tax and a tax on inherited wealth, which are used to finance both a basic income and a \u201ccapital endowment\u201d for every citizen.</p> <p>In a single table, Piketty demonstrates that, in the abstract, it would be possible to finance a radically egalitarian economy if both income tax and inheritance tax for the rich were set around 60-70%. The outcome would be to \u201cmake ownership of capital temporary\u201d. Meanwhile, by legislating to enforce power-sharing within firms, between workers and bosses, you could achieve the \u201ctrue social ownership of capital\u201d.</p> <p>The problem, of course, is the resistance of the current elites: the phalanx of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/feb/21/super-pacs-campaign-finance-explained\" title=\"\">Super Pacs in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/feb/21/super-pacs-campaign-finance-explained\" title=\"\">the US</a>, the Brahmin-like permanence of the European centrists, the extreme concentration of power alongside wealth, the evisceration of democracy, the culture of secrecy around the taxes paid by rich people and corporations.</p> <p>It\u2019s a resistance bolstered by the ideology of what he calls \u201chypercapitalism\u201d: our willingness to believe billionaires have earned their money, that their philanthropy offsets their greed, that most of the poor are \u201cundeserving\u201d, and that any tinkering with the present distribution of wealth will lead to economic collapse.</p> <p>As the book demonstrates, the task is further complicated by the breakdown of left-right politics. Piketty makes the case that most electorates are now fractured into four parts: the globalist camp is split between egalitarians and anti-egalitarians, but so is the nativist camp. As a result, any movement for economic equality has to include nativists and globalists, who, as the UK general election showed, currently hate each other\u2019s guts.</p> <p>If there is a case for optimism in this book, it relies on the incoherence of the hypercapitalist ideology, which promises social mobility to the poorest 50% but repeatedly dumps them at the bottom of the pile.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b9797049d15494f185aee2024205a32f05c5e64c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9797049d15494f185aee2024205a32f05c5e64c/0_0_4659_3096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Piketty\u2019s big idea is to tax capitalism out of existence\u2019: an Occupy Wall Street protester, New York, September 2013\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Piketty\u2019s big idea is to tax capitalism out of existence\u2019: an Occupy Wall Street protester, New York, September 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Piketty, the history of ideologies is autonomous from that of the societies they have been used to justify. Unlike Marx, who wrote that all history \u201cis the history of class struggles\u201d, Piketty believes it is \u201cthe history of the struggle of ideologies and the quest for justice\u201d. For the avoidance of doubt, Piketty does not say \u2013 as French structuralists did \u2013 that ideology is relatively autonomous from the economy: instead he says \u201cthe realm of ideas, the political-ideological sphere, is truly autonomous\u201d.</p> <p>Piketty\u2019s socialism, then, is not just a socialism without the working class. It is a socialism without class struggle, or the need for class struggle. As a result, the intellectual and moral rearmament the left must undergo has to arise out of academia, or the world of thinktanks and NGOs. As for ideologies, they are, in Piketty\u2019s historical scheme, almost never busted open from below, but simply destined to lose their coherence from within.</p> <p>As he recounts the history of the transition from slave-owning, feudal and colonial societies towards 19th-century modernity, the most consistent actor in the name of progress is the state. By the end of the book, while we have a detailed description of the correlation between forms of inequality and the ideologies used to justify them, there is not a trace of cause and effect. Facts, Piketty states, are untrustworthy because they themselves are socially constructed.</p> <p>It is as if Piketty, a commanding figure in the economics department, has sauntered across to give a (very long) lecture series in the history department without bothering to engage in the methodological debates that rage there. But his implicit method is that of the Enlightenment philosopher Georg Hegel: human progress exists, the state is nearly always its main actor, and history is driven by supra-historical ideas \u2013 above all, the idea of justice.</p> <p>And that\u2019s what makes his political solutions seem so abstract and unworkable. What happens to the value-creation process in a world where the rich are getting their wealth confiscated and their incomes flattened (ie the actual problem that destroyed the Soviet experiment)?

      "bodyText": "To bring a book into the world with 1,065 pages, there has to be a good reason. Thomas Piketty\u2019s reason is that without a detailed account of the ideologies that have sustained inequality in the past, we cannot understand its present form, or how to overcome it. So Capital and Ideology takes us on a historical grand tour of the hypocrisy of elites, ranging from the punishments meted out to slaves in Mesopotamia to the cruelty of the Belle \u00c9poque, which, as French economist Piketty points out, was belle only for a small number of white men. But the main focus of the book is the present, which is marked by extreme and rising inequality, alongside the breakdown of traditional, class-based politics. The social coalition that drove redistribution in the mid-20th century has disappeared. If we don\u2019t do something radical to reduce inequality, Piketty argues, \u201cxenophobic populism could well triumph at the ballot box and initiate changes that will destroy the global, hypercapitalist digital economy\u201d. Piketty\u2019s 2014 book Capital in the 21st Century showed how inequality is baked into our current economic model. In a free-market economy, he argues, inequality inevitably rises faster than growth. And as the incomes of the rich become reliant more on asset wealth than salaries, the old forms of redistribution, based on income tax and corporation tax, cease to work. In this book, Piketty outlines his solution: a \u201cparticipatory socialism\u201d in which capitalism is gradually abolished via a progressive income tax and a tax on inherited wealth, which are used to finance both a basic income and a \u201ccapital endowment\u201d for every citizen. In a single table, Piketty demonstrates that, in the abstract, it would be possible to finance a radically egalitarian economy if both income tax and inheritance tax for the rich were set around 60-70%. The outcome would be to \u201cmake ownership of capital temporary\u201d. Meanwhile, by legislating to enforce power-sharing within firms, between workers and bosses, you could achieve the \u201ctrue social ownership of capital\u201d. The problem, of course, is the resistance of the current elites: the phalanx of Super Pacs in the US, the Brahmin-like permanence of the European centrists, the extreme concentration of power alongside wealth, the evisceration of democracy, the culture of secrecy around the taxes paid by rich people and corporations. It\u2019s a resistance bolstered by the ideology of what he calls \u201chypercapitalism\u201d: our willingness to believe billionaires have earned their money, that their philanthropy offsets their greed, that most of the poor are \u201cundeserving\u201d, and that any tinkering with the present distribution of wealth will lead to economic collapse. As the book demonstrates, the task is further complicated by the breakdown of left-right politics. Piketty makes the case that most electorates are now fractured into four parts: the globalist camp is split between egalitarians and anti-egalitarians, but so is the nativist camp. As a result, any movement for economic equality has to include nativists and globalists, who, as the UK general election showed, currently hate each other\u2019s guts. If there is a case for optimism in this book, it relies on the incoherence of the hypercapitalist ideology, which promises social mobility to the poorest 50% but repeatedly dumps them at the bottom of the pile.

Ireland\u2019s head coach, Andy Farrell, has an extra week to prepare for his side\u2019s final match against the leaders, France, in Paris, but he is not sure if it will go ahead. \u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we can do is prepare properly for it.\u201d Ireland\u2019s match against Italy is unlikely to be rescheduled before October. The Aviva Stadium will be unavailable from the middle of May because three Euro 2020 football matches are being staged at the ground and September is a rest month for the country\u2019s national squad following the summer tour to Australia. \u201cWe want to play the game,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cA few dates are being bounced around but they are just ideas and we really do not have a clue.\u201d The Six Nations will be guided by the governments of the countries involved. England are expected to be followed to Rome by 20,000 supporters, but on Friday the UN health agency upgraded the global risk of the virus to very high, saying the increase in the number of cases and the countries involved was \u201cclearly a concern\u201d. It leaves one of the closest title races for years in danger of a late finish, as happened in 2001 when restrictions on travel because of a foot-and-mouth outbreak meant Ireland did not play their three fellow home unions until September and October of the following season and England missed out on the grand slam after a six-month wait. While five teams have a mathematical chance of winning the title, Wales and Scotland are all but out of it after losing two of their opening three matches. Yet Wales have the best points difference, +28, of the six teams while Scotland have conceded the fewest points, 32, and the lowest number of tries, two. Murrayfield is the fourth leg of what France hope will be their first grand slam since 2010.

By the end of the season, MLB\u2019s increasingly traumatised battalions of pitchers had collectively given up 6,776 homers, an advance of nearly 11% on the previous record of 6,106.

A personal favourite is that it might be down to mozzies. It was, so the thinking goes, a bumper year for biting insects in the pastures where the cows that provide the leather for around 160,000 MLB baseballs each year like to graze.

Nothing has shifted it significantly, including the arrival of billions of pounds\u2019 worth of striking talent and plenty of rule tweaks down the years, few of which would have been implemented with the aim of actually making it more difficult to score.

Stopping the opposition achieving it is, by extension, a relative stroll in the park. Expected goals (xG) figures for the season as a whole suggest teams are, overall, scoring as many goals as they should given the chances they get.

It is eight years since she gave up her training licence but, thanks to the various ventures she has taken on since, she is once more close to the beating heart of jump racing, her skills enormously in demand.</p> <p>The most oft-repeated refrain in winner\u2019s enclosures around the country this winter has been: \u201cHe\u2019s done a bit of schooling with Hen.\u201d Bidders at Cheltenham\u2019s December sale were stunned to find themselves bested by Knight, who went to \u00a3450,000 for the top lot on behalf of a mystery owner, since revealed to be the north-west businessman Mike Grech. The next month, she was in Doncaster, signing a tab for \u00a3370,000 for the promising youngster everyone wanted.</p> <p>She has also become one of the more prolific writers on horse racing, having published in the past four years an autobiography, a study of training methods that required a tour of stables in Britain and Ireland and a book about why anyone would want to be a jump jockey that drew on interviews with 83 of them. It is not just Knight who has never been this busy; very few people have ever been this busy.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something happening all the time and it\u2019s exciting,\u201d she says as we talk in her farmhouse, in the Oxfordshire village where she has always lived.

I was just sort of wandering about. I managed to fall over by the duck pond, rounding up the geese, and broke a leg. It was the most inconvenient, stupid thing anybody has ever done and I spent 10 days in hospital.</p> <p>\u201cI came back fairly low and I had to do something because I like my days being full. They were very full when I was looking after Terry because he needed a lot of care but once he died there was nothing much to do.\u201d</p> <p>So she wrote Not Enough Time, the story of their years together, and decided to have some horses back on the premises. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to keep looking out of the window on empty boxes. Everything in the farmyard was empty. It was depressing.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/28/talking-horses-no-such-thing-as-too-much-information-for-punters\">Talking Horses: no such thing as 'too much information' for punters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At first, any kind of horse in need of a home was enough. Things are different now; Knight\u2019s 30 boxes are full and there is a queue of trainers wanting to send her their charges for the best foundation course in jumping this side of the Irish Sea.</p> <p>The upcoming Cheltenham Festival will feature many of her former pupils, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjZyenTDrJc\" title=\"\">Pentland Hills</a>, a Champion Hurdle contender. She recalls phoning his trainer, Nicky Henderson, with an upbeat early report. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t rated very high on the Flat,\u201d replied the doubtful Henderson. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to rate a good bit higher over hurdles,\u201d she assured him.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/27/potters-corner-prevails-home-winner-of-welsh-grand-national\" title=\"\">Welsh National winner</a>, Potters Corner, came here four days before his moment of glory at Chepstow for a session in Knight\u2019s \u201cloose school\u201d, a tight little circuit where horses practice jumping without a rider. Such is the value placed on her work by Christian Williams, the Glamorgan-based trainer, that he made the six-hour round trip with Potters Corner and plans to do so again shortly before the Grand National in April.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a4c65cb1bab1217b936c37bf321af02df039f6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a4c65cb1bab1217b936c37bf321af02df039f6b/60_401_4223_2534/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Potters Corner, ridden by Jack Tudor, jumps the last before going on to win the Welsh Grand National at Chepstow in December 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Potters Corner, ridden by Jack Tudor, jumps the last before going on to win the Welsh Grand National at Chepstow in December 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Trump/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The loose school, the only one of its kind in the area that Knight knows of, has attained semi\u2011legendary status. Gordon Elliott took careful note of its dimensions so he could replicate it at his hugely successful County Meath yard, where, to her amusement, a sign labels it \u201cHen\u2019s ring\u201d.</p> <p>It is not enough, she points out quietly, to have the thing itself; you must also know how to use it for the benefit of this particular animal. \u201cIt\u2019s no good just standing in the middle like a circus master, cracking a whip.\u201d</p> <p>Knight has little use for loud noises of any kind, reckoning that the best trainers are nearly always laid-back characters whose placidity is communicated to their horses. She cites the example of \u201cmy hero\u201d Aidan O\u2019Brien, whose four-by-four became hopelessly stuck in a muddy field last month while the pair were watching work at his Ballydoyle stable. \u201cLots of people would have ranted or flapped. He didn\u2019t react. He was totally calm, which is typical of him.\u201d</p> <p>Beneath Knight\u2019s cheerful calmness is a formidable drive and she deplores absence of drive in others. \u201cMan in a car the other day, got to the edge of the flood in the village, saw other cars coming through it, panicked and tried to turn round in the flood and go back the other way because he thought he\u2019d get stuck. Caused chaos because my girls were trying to go through the puddle on their horses at the same time. And this idiot was trying to reverse and got himself into a right pickle.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a classic example of someone who\u2019ll get nowhere in life. He went back home. He ventured no further. You\u2019ve got to go forward.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is an odd kind of retirement that leads one to say \u201cI\u2019ve never been as busy\u201d at the age of 73 but that is the kind Henrietta Knight has chosen and it suits her perfectly. It is eight years since she gave up her training licence but, thanks to the various ventures she has taken on since, she is once more close to the beating heart of jump racing, her skills enormously in demand. The most oft-repeated refrain in winner\u2019s enclosures around the country this winter has been: \u201cHe\u2019s done a bit of schooling with Hen.\u201d Bidders at Cheltenham\u2019s December sale were stunned to find themselves bested by Knight, who went to \u00a3450,000 for the top lot on behalf of a mystery owner, since revealed to be the north-west businessman Mike Grech. The next month, she was in Doncaster, signing a tab for \u00a3370,000 for the promising youngster everyone wanted. She has also become one of the more prolific writers on horse racing, having published in the past four years an autobiography, a study of training methods that required a tour of stables in Britain and Ireland and a book about why anyone would want to be a jump jockey that drew on interviews with 83 of them. It is not just Knight who has never been this busy; very few people have ever been this busy. \u201cThere\u2019s something happening all the time and it\u2019s exciting,\u201d she says as we talk in her farmhouse, in the Oxfordshire village where she has always lived. This is a new life, one she began to build in early 2014, following the loss of her husband, Terry Biddlecombe, with whom she had shared the extraordinary career of Best Mate, the only triple Gold Cup winner since Arkle. \u201cI was really not quite with it after Terry died. I was just sort of wandering about. I managed to fall over by the duck pond, rounding up the geese, and broke a leg. It was the most inconvenient, stupid thing anybody has ever done and I spent 10 days in hospital. \u201cI came back fairly low and I had to do something because I like my days being full. They were very full when I was looking after Terry because he needed a lot of care but once he died there was nothing much to do.\u201d So she wrote Not Enough Time, the story of their years together, and decided to have some horses back on the premises. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to keep looking out of the window on empty boxes. Everything in the farmyard was empty. It was depressing.\u201d At first, any kind of horse in need of a home was enough. Things are different now; Knight\u2019s 30 boxes are full and there is a queue of trainers wanting to send her their charges for the best foundation course in jumping this side of the Irish Sea. The upcoming Cheltenham Festival will feature many of her former pupils, including Pentland Hills, a Champion Hurdle contender. She recalls phoning his trainer, Nicky Henderson, with an upbeat early report. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t rated very high on the Flat,\u201d replied the doubtful Henderson. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to rate a good bit higher over hurdles,\u201d she assured him. The Welsh National winner, Potters Corner, came here four days before his moment of glory at Chepstow for a session in Knight\u2019s \u201cloose school\u201d, a tight little circuit where horses practice jumping without a rider. Such is the value placed on her work by Christian Williams, the Glamorgan-based trainer, that he made the six-hour round trip with Potters Corner and plans to do so again shortly before the Grand National in April. The loose school, the only one of its kind in the area that Knight knows of, has attained semi\u2011legendary status. Gordon Elliott took careful note of its dimensions so he could replicate it at his hugely successful County Meath yard, where, to her amusement, a sign labels it \u201cHen\u2019s ring\u201d. It is not enough, she points out quietly, to have the thing itself; you must also know how to use it for the benefit of this particular animal. \u201cIt\u2019s no good just standing in the middle like a circus master, cracking a whip.\u201d Knight has little use for loud noises of any kind, reckoning that the best trainers are nearly always laid-back characters whose placidity is communicated to their horses. She cites the example of \u201cmy hero\u201d Aidan O\u2019Brien, whose four-by-four became hopelessly stuck in a muddy field last month while the pair were watching work at his Ballydoyle stable. \u201cLots of people would have ranted or flapped. He didn\u2019t react. He was totally calm, which is typical of him.\u201d Beneath Knight\u2019s cheerful calmness is a formidable drive and she deplores absence of drive in others. \u201cMan in a car the other day, got to the edge of the flood in the village, saw other cars coming through it, panicked and tried to turn round in the flood and go back the other way because he thought he\u2019d get stuck. Caused chaos because my girls were trying to go through the puddle on their horses at the same time. And this idiot was trying to reverse and got himself into a right pickle. \u201cHe was a classic example of someone who\u2019ll get nowhere in life. He went back home. He ventured no further. You\u2019ve got to go forward.\u201d",

It is shown here for the first time as a Rembrandt, and while the artist seems to be here in person, as a compelling self-portrait at the top of an ungainly pyramid of parents and children, the painting is such a pile-up of idioms it is hard to believe that it is not by several different artists.</p> <p>The shocked self-portrait is reprised in a painting of Delilah shearing off Samson\u2019s hair.

Harry Dunn, 19, died last summer after his motorbike collided with a car near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US agent who worked at the base, has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving and has apologised to Dunn\u2019s family, but is refusing to return to Britain. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has rejected the UK\u2019s request for her extradition, claiming that at the time of the collision she had immunity from criminal prosecution, even though her husband did not. The Foreign Office has confirmed the existence of a secret agreement between the UK and the US, signed in 1995, granting US staff working at the base diplomatic immunity, though they are still subject to criminal prosecution under UK law. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab has told parliament that in his view an anomaly in the agreement meant that, while the US staff had waived their rights to be protected against criminal prosecution in the UK, this did not extend to their families. He has pledged to redraft the agreement after learning about the loophole. But lawyers acting for the Dunn family said there were grave doubts over whether the anomaly existed or, if it did, afforded the legal protection Raab has claimed.

The neophyte chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak</a>, and his officials face what one calls \u201cthe nightmare\u201d of presenting a budget when all the underpinning assumptions about growth, borrowing, spending and tax revenues have been rendered even more flaky than usual.</p> <p>The spread of the coronavirus also has significant implications for Mr Johnson\u2019s attempt to secure a decent trade deal with the EU.

The prime minister and his cabinet will have to make some large decisions about the extent to which normal life is curtailed. Following Japan\u2019s example and closing all schools will take many adults out of the workforce to look after their children. Emulating the Chinese model of shutting down factories, offices, shops, restaurants and transport networks in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus will mean hurting many businesses and the livelihoods of those who work for them. Some firms will go bust. The Swiss have prohibited all gatherings of more than 1,000 people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/swiss-government-bans-large-events-on-back-of-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">cancelling</a> the Geneva motor show. The Saudis are banning foreign travellers from visiting the two holiest sites in Islam. Italy has placed several towns in the north under police-controlled quarantine. Other measures can include closing all museums, theatres and cinemas, and cancelling music festivals and sporting fixtures. All of which have knock-on economic effects.</p> <p>As Professor Whitty observes, the prohibition of so many human activities that we normally take for granted would have \u201cnon-trivial implications\u201d. The experience of previous viral outbreaks suggests that the biggest impact on economies and incomes will come not from the disease itself but from the responses. There are trade-offs between doing everything a government can to stop the spread of contagion, and the disruption that containment strategies will inflict on economic and social life. The chief medical officer is right to suggest that \u201cwe are going to have to have, as a society, a serious discussion about how we manage the trade-offs\u201d.</p> <p>I am going to put the choice more bluntly than he does \u2013 or any politician is ever likely to be brave enough to spell out. Should we take every measure available to try to counter the virus and at whatever economic and social cost? Or are we better advised to take less stringent steps to minimise the impact on society, at the price of increasing the risk of infection and, for those most vulnerable to the virus, elevating the risk of death?</p> <p>This is the critical dilemma that is lurking behind many of the calculations and pronouncements by politicians and their advisers. The debate needs to be had honestly and openly. It is a conversation that will need to be led. To govern is to choose. One choice no leader can make at a time of crisis is to hide.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

Some firms will go bust. The Swiss have prohibited all gatherings of more than 1,000 people, cancelling the Geneva motor show. The Saudis are banning foreign travellers from visiting the two holiest sites in Islam. Italy has placed several towns in the north under police-controlled quarantine. Other measures can include closing all museums, theatres and cinemas, and cancelling music festivals and sporting fixtures. All of which have knock-on economic effects. As Professor Whitty observes, the prohibition of so many human activities that we normally take for granted would have \u201cnon-trivial implications\u201d. The experience of previous viral outbreaks suggests that the biggest impact on economies and incomes will come not from the disease itself but from the responses. There are trade-offs between doing everything a government can to stop the spread of contagion, and the disruption that containment strategies will inflict on economic and social life. The chief medical officer is right to suggest that \u201cwe are going to have to have, as a society, a serious discussion about how we manage the trade-offs\u201d. I am going to put the choice more bluntly than he does \u2013 or any politician is ever likely to be brave enough to spell out. Should we take every measure available to try to counter the virus and at whatever economic and social cost? Or are we better advised to take less stringent steps to minimise the impact on society, at the price of increasing the risk of infection and, for those most vulnerable to the virus, elevating the risk of death? This is the critical dilemma that is lurking behind many of the calculations and pronouncements by politicians and their advisers. The debate needs to be had honestly and openly. It is a conversation that will need to be led. To govern is to choose. One choice no leader can make at a time of crisis is to hide. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

Having made an arthouse splash with the Euro-hits <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/14/worldcinema.drama\" title=\"\">Water Lilies</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/17/tomboy-review\" title=\"\">Tomboy</a></em>, she wrote and directed <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/10/girlhood-gritty-teen-life-review-mark-kermode\" title=\"\">Girlhood</a></em> (<em>Bande </em><em>de </em><em>filles</em>), a breathtaking portrait of modern \u201cbanlieue life\u201d that completed her \u201caccidental trilogy of youth\u201d. Her impressive screenplay credits include Claude Barras\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/04/my-life-as-courgette-review\" title=\"\">My Life as a Courgette</a></em>, a tenderly empathetic, French-Swiss stop-motion masterpiece that earned an Oscar nomination for its vividly resilient depiction of children in care. In each of these very different projects, Sciamma has struck an accessible chord by focusing tightly on specifics, finding the key to universal appeal in the unique, tiny details of each story and character.</p> <p>For her fourth feature as writer-director, Sciamma ventures to a new world of the late 18th century. We first meet Marianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant, star of Marie-Castille Mention-Schaar\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PgFiZwQdQM\" title=\"\">Le ciel attendra</a></em>) teaching life study in Paris to art students, one of whom stumbles upon her titular painting. An arresting night-time image of a woman whose dress is hemmed with flames, this painting provides a portal to the past. Through it, we are transported back to Marianne\u2019s stormy, sea-bound arrival at a remote Brittany residence where she is to paint former convent girl H\u00e9lo\u00efse (<em>Water Lilies</em> alumnus Ad\u00e8le Haenel). H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s countess mother (played with imperious fragility by Valeria Golino) intends to send the painting to a Milanese nobleman; if he approves, her daughter will be wed and they will both be transported to a new life. But H\u00e9lo\u00efse has no desire to be married, and has already defeated one painter who left without ever seeing her face. So Marianne, who has been brought here on the pretext of being a chaperone and companion, must study and paint her subject in secret, looking without appearing to look\u2026</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/21/celine-sciamma-portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire\">C\u00e9line Sciamma: 'In\u00a0France, they don\u2019t find the film hot. They think it lacks flesh, it\u2019s not erotic'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That this deception should soon be revealed is no surprise \u2013 the electric tension between the pair prevents either of them from keeping secrets for long. Yet when confronted with Marianne\u2019s first attempt to capture her likeness, H\u00e9lo\u00efse is appalled. \u201cIs that how you see me?\u201d she demands, stunned less by Marianne\u2019s deceit than by the lack of life \u2013 of \u201cpresence\u201d \u2013 in her picture. \u201cThe fact it isn\u2019t close to me, <em>that</em> I can understand,\u201d she says bitterly. \u201cBut I find it sad it isn\u2019t close to <em>you</em>.\u201d</p> <p>What follows is an intellectually erotic study of power and passion in which observed becomes observer, authored becomes author, returning time and again to a central question: \u201cIf you look at me, who do I look at?\u201d It\u2019s a question that reverberates throughout Sciamma\u2019s playfully literate film, which rightly won the Cannes prize for best screenplay last year.

      "bodyText": "What a thrillingly versatile film-maker C\u00e9line Sciamma has proved to be. Having made an arthouse splash with the Euro-hits Water Lilies and Tomboy, she wrote and directed Girlhood (Bande de filles), a breathtaking portrait of modern \u201cbanlieue life\u201d that completed her \u201caccidental trilogy of youth\u201d. Her impressive screenplay credits include Claude Barras\u2019s My Life as a Courgette, a tenderly empathetic, French-Swiss stop-motion masterpiece that earned an Oscar nomination for its vividly resilient depiction of children in care. In each of these very different projects, Sciamma has struck an accessible chord by focusing tightly on specifics, finding the key to universal appeal in the unique, tiny details of each story and character. For her fourth feature as writer-director, Sciamma ventures to a new world of the late 18th century. We first meet Marianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant, star of Marie-Castille Mention-Schaar\u2019s Le ciel attendra) teaching life study in Paris to art students, one of whom stumbles upon her titular painting. An arresting night-time image of a woman whose dress is hemmed with flames, this painting provides a portal to the past. Through it, we are transported back to Marianne\u2019s stormy, sea-bound arrival at a remote Brittany residence where she is to paint former convent girl H\u00e9lo\u00efse (Water Lilies alumnus Ad\u00e8le Haenel). H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s countess mother (played with imperious fragility by Valeria Golino) intends to send the painting to a Milanese nobleman; if he approves, her daughter will be wed and they will both be transported to a new life. But H\u00e9lo\u00efse has no desire to be married, and has already defeated one painter who left without ever seeing her face. So Marianne, who has been brought here on the pretext of being a chaperone and companion, must study and paint her subject in secret, looking without appearing to look\u2026 That this deception should soon be revealed is no surprise \u2013 the electric tension between the pair prevents either of them from keeping secrets for long. Yet when confronted with Marianne\u2019s first attempt to capture her likeness, H\u00e9lo\u00efse is appalled. \u201cIs that how you see me?\u201d she demands, stunned less by Marianne\u2019s deceit than by the lack of life \u2013 of \u201cpresence\u201d \u2013 in her picture. \u201cThe fact it isn\u2019t close to me, that I can understand,\u201d she says bitterly. \u201cBut I find it sad it isn\u2019t close to you.\u201d What follows is an intellectually erotic study of power and passion in which observed becomes observer, authored becomes author, returning time and again to a central question: \u201cIf you look at me, who do I look at?\u201d It\u2019s a question that reverberates throughout Sciamma\u2019s playfully literate film, which rightly won the Cannes prize for best screenplay last year. We hear it echoed in a historically accurate discussion of the way the art world keeps women in their place by proscribing the subjects of their gaze, their inquiry. More significantly, it informs an ongoing debate about the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice that runs like a silver thread through the drama. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t make the lover\u2019s choice, but the poet\u2019s,\u201d Marianne says of Orpheus and his fateful decision to look back as he ascends from the underworld. But perhaps that decision was not his to make? Could Eurydice be the author of her own fate, the commander of his gaze? Digitally filmed in tactile, painterly hues by Claire Mathon, who did such shimmering work on Mati Diop\u2019s Atlantics, Portrait of a Lady on Fire (the French title uses the less Jamesian \u201cjeune fille\u201d) seamlessly intertwines themes of love and politics, representation and reality. At times it plays like a breathless romance, trembling with passionate anticipation. Elsewhere, it seems closer to a sociopolitical treatise, what Sciamma has called \u201ca manifesto about the female gaze\u201d.

      "bodyText": "In 2016, a little-known Conservative MP authored a paper for the Centre for Policy Studies, the free-market thinktank founded by Keith Joseph and Margaret Thatcher. Looking ahead to Britain\u2019s post-Brexit future, the report argued, the government should seize the opportunity to create a string of free ports across the country to revive manufacturing. These engines of economic growth would reconnect Britain with its \u201cproud maritime history\u201d and act as a \u201cbeacon of British values\u201d. The MP in question was Rishi Sunak. Four years later, Britain has left the EU, Sunak has been promoted to chancellor of the exchequer, and Boris Johnson is shaping the direction of Britain\u2019s economy. If Johnsonism, as Ferdinand Mount writes, \u201cis not a continuation of Thatcherism at all\u201d, Sunak\u2019s 2016 proposal should make us wonder. His recent plan for free ports, based on the 2016 report, reheats an idea that first gained prominence under Thatcher\u2019s government, and reeks of precisely the free-market ideas from which the new government is supposedly distancing itself. Though the Conservative party\u2019s post-Brexit economic worldview has often been likened to \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d, Sunak\u2019s vision is more Tennessee-on-Tyne. Free ports most resemble the foreign trade zones that have existed in the US since the 1930s, where goods aren\u2019t subject to tariffs until (and if) they cross over into the domestic market.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration\u2019s politicization of science and cuts to health institutions are raising concerns about its preparedness to handle the coronavirus outbreak. The first known death from the virus on US soil was reported in Washington state on Saturday. Sixty-six cases have been reported across the country, and thousands more globally. But health experts say the Trump administration is still sending mixed messages about a growing public health crisis. \u201cIt undermines public trust,\u201d Dr Georges C Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told the Guardian. \u201cThis isn\u2019t well-coordinated.\u201d Before a White House press conference on Saturday, Donald Trump repeatedly downplayed the issue and echoed allies in the conservative media in accusing political opponents and the media of overstating the threat in order to make him look bad while markets take a hard hit, threatening the US economy. On Saturday, the president repeatedly praised what he called \u201cthe most aggressive action in modern history to confront this disease\u201d. \u201cOur country is prepared for any circumstance, we hope it\u2019s not going to be a major circumstance,\u201d Trump said, asking the media and politicians not to do \u201canything to incite panic at all\u201d. Trump and federal health officials also sought to reassure the public about the nature of the coronavirus, if in calmer tones than those chosen by Mick Mulvaney, the president\u2019s acting chief of staff, at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday. Suggesting the media was inflating the issue to \u201cbring down\u201d the president, Mulvaney said the virus was less threatening than previous public health crises, such as the Ebola crisis of 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s not a death sentence,\u201d Mulvaney said. Public health officials, however, have repeatedly warned of the seriousness of the outbreak. At the White House on Saturday, Dr Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases detailed how most coronavirus deaths are in older people with health issues but younger people do die in outlying cases. \u201cUltimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country,\u201d Nancy Messonnier, head of immunization at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more exactly when this will happen, and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\u201d \u201cThis could be bad,\u201d Messonnier added. Experts warn that conflicting statements could complicate public health officials\u2019 response to the crisis at federal, state and local levels. \u201cIf you have different messengers giving different messages, that is a recipe for confusion, and could potentially undermine the effectiveness of the response,\u201d said Dr Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. The administration\u2019s continued dismissal of the severity of the situation has also exacerbated concerns that it has not taken the threat seriously enough \u2013 and that it is already in a weakened position because of funding and personnel cuts to health programs. The Trump administration has repeatedly proposed significant cuts to health and science agencies, including in the 2021 budget, in which he called for a close to 10% reduction in Health and Human Services funding overall and a nearly 16% slash at the CDC. While Congress has ignored those proposed cuts and instead increased funding to the CDC and National Institutes of Health, some initiatives aimed at battling epidemics have been cut or eliminated. In 2018, when the White House declined to provide the agency with additional resources, the CDC downsized by 80% programs designed to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The same year, the administration shuttered the National Security Council\u2019s global health security unit. Robert O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, has suggested such cuts were part of a \u201cstreamlining\u201d of the NSC. But former officials have expressed concern. \u201cThis is why you have a National Security Council,\u201d former Pentagon speechwriter John Gans, who wrote a book about the NSC, told NBC News this week. Experts told the Guardian public health funding issues predate the Trump administration. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of peoples\u2019 fault,\u201d Benjamin said, adding that the current administration has \u201cexacerbated\u201d the matter. \u201cAny time something new like this happens, it\u2019s going to be messy,\u201d the APHA executive director said of the coronavirus. But \u201cseveral of the administration\u2019s actions have undermined our preparedness.\u201d Dr John Ioannidis, chair in disease prevention at Stanford University medical school, urged calm, warning against a \u201cpanic epidemic\u201d and \u201cextreme measures\u201d in response to the virus. \u201cBoth politicians and self-proclaimed experts should talk less,\u201d Ioannidis told the Guardian in an email. Others, however, have continued to express concern. Already the US has experienced issues with faulty test kits and a delayed diagnosis for a California woman believed to be the first instance of community spread in the country. Critics of the administration have also raised concerns about the $2.5bn the White House requested this week from Congress, arguing that it was too small to adequately address the problem. Concerns have also been raised about Trump\u2019s appointment of Vice-President Mike Pence to coordinate the government response. Trump \u201cmade the choice of putting someone absolutely not up to the task to this crucial position\u201d, Gregg Gonsalves, assistant professor of epidemiology at Yale University, tweeted after the announcement. \u201cThey need to do a lot of work to rebuild public trust,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cHopefully, they\u2019re learning that lesson.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Trefan Morys is a low 18th-century barn, stone-built, slate-roofed, topped with a weather vane and surrounded by a dense tangle of garden beneath a towering elm tree. Jan Morris has lived here, halfway up a hill in the top-left corner of Wales, with Elizabeth, once her wife, now her civil partner, for the past 30 years. Before that they had raised their four children in the big manor house a little further down the lane toward Criccieth and the coast. Like everything about Jan Morris\u2019s long and unique life there is a kind of storytellers\u2019 magic to Trefan Morys. Last week, I drove up through Snowdonia and down toward the Irish Sea, to listen to some of Morris\u2019s myths and legends, while the last of storm Dennis rattled outside.</p> <p>Hearing about most lives you have a sense of beginnings and middles and ends, but Morris\u2019s 93 years resist very much in the way of this-led-to-that. It is a life that forms instead around improbable adventures a million miles from here \u2013 Morris, at 26, was the only journalist to accompany Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay on their 1953 ascent of Everest; at other times she wrote about living on Field Marshal Montgomery\u2019s family houseboat on the Nile, and in a palazzo on the Grand Canal; she met Che Guevara in Cuba; she visited Hiroshima after the bomb, and reported on the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961. In her dreamy books about cities \u2013 most memorably Venice and Trieste \u2013 the world can seem a permanent Xanadu.</p> <p>These unlikely journeys are nothing, though, in some ways, beside the defining romantic quest of her life. Jan Morris was born James Humphrey Morris on 2 October 1926, in Somerset. As she recalled in her memoir, <em>Conundrum</em>, \u201cI was three or perhaps four when I realised that I had been born into the wrong body, and should really be a girl.\u201d She was under a piano at the time, listening to her mother play Sibelius. <em>Conundrum</em> detailed a pioneering journey across a perilous internal border. A journey that involved years of hormone therapy and culminated in reassignment surgery in Casablanca in 1972, before a return here, to Llanystumdwy, to Elizabeth and to their children.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People read my books and say \u2018What did you mean by that?\u2019 To be honest I\u2019m not always sure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From the vantage of 93, some of this life has started to seem like a foreign country to Morris. She still lives with Elizabeth, who suffers from dementia. Their youngest son, Twm, a poet, writing in Welsh, lives in a cottage across the road and \u201cis a miracle\u201d, Morris says, in the help he gives them. Jan does not travel very far these days, though her trusty Honda Sport R still sits ready for action on the gravel outside. Her books have shrunk in scope, too. The last two, the bestselling <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/09/in-my-minds-eye-jan-morris-review\" title=\"\">In My Mind\u2019s Eye</a></em> and her new book, <em>Thinking Again</em>, are composed of daily diary entries that unlock Morris\u2019s storehouse of memory as they describe children in coffee shops or dogs on the beach at Pwllheli. The pace of those books is set by the 1,000 daily steps up and down the lane outside that she commits to as an exercise regime, and the marching tunes that she whistles as she goes. The tone is of someone who has seen the whole world and decided on this place as an ending.</p> <p>In the long, beamed sitting room of Trefan Morys, we talk first about the house itself. When they all lived down the road, the kids used to come and play here in the stables, overgrown with bramble. Later Jan and Elizabeth felt the big house was unmanageable, so they found a buyer, cleared out the horse stalls here, brought the books and bookcases from the other place, along with the weather vane, renovated and moved in.</p> <p>In the final diary entry of <em>Thinking Again</em>, Morris dwells on \u201chiraeth\u201d that Welsh word that is often translated as nostalgia, but which she \u2013 half-Welsh, half-English, another hybrid \u2013 feels more like a national addiction to longing. \u201cIt is a different thing for Twm, for example,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have his instinct for Welshness, with him it is more basic, it comes out of the soil, for me it is more an idea.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8904b6232e007e3b95ddc464840ba043905b2984\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8904b6232e007e3b95ddc464840ba043905b2984/456_401_3776_3742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Morris, Nepal, 1953.

We have it every day at different windows.\u201d</p> <p>The tapping of the bird leads Morris into the first of a few apologies that she no longer has the eloquence she once did as an interviewee. \u201cSometimes I fear I am not exactly compos mentis,\u201d she says. \u201cIt comes and goes. Like with Elizabeth. The other morning I was taking her breakfast on a tray and I fell, and there were cornflakes everywhere, and marmalade. I thought, well no good asking Elizabeth to help with this. But she came out, and miraculously was transformed into the real Elizabeth, and briskly helped me clear it all up beautifully. I said to her a few minutes later how encouraging she can still do that, but she could not remember what had happened.\u201d</p> <p>Morris looks around her bookshelves, the thousands of books that line this long room floor to ceiling. \u201cPeople always say: \u2018Have you read them all?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cNo. but I have an emotional attachment to them all. I pick an old book out and if it is interesting I read a few pages. I put letters and photographs and cards in them to find later.\u201d</p> <p>Does she still get a lot of correspondence?</p> <p>\u201cMostly from people who go to Trieste or Venice and read my books, and say \u2018What did you mean by that\u2019? To be honest I\u2019m not always sure.\u201d</p> <p>As a wandering writer \u2013 she is widely acclaimed for inventing a way of writing about cities that blends history and imaginative description and a sort of psychology of place \u2013 Morris made much of herself being an outsider. In <em>Conundrum</em> she wondered whether her \u201cincessant wandering\u201d as a journalist for the <em>Times</em> and the <em>Guardian</em> and freelance \u201chad been an outward expression of my inner journey\u201d. She has resisted the idea of biography, though she allowed Derek Johns, her former agent, to write her literary life, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/04/ariel-literary-life-jan-morris-derek-johns-review-dashing-post-letters-patrick-leigh-fermor-sisman\" title=\"\">Ariel</a>.</em> In it he notes at one point how \u201cit is interesting to consider that the move from male to female and the move from Englishness to Welshness were roughly concurrent\u201d. She herself has suggested that she always favoured the \u201csoft side\u201d of her character more than \u201cthe hard side\u201d, and that Wales was closer to that softness. She is reluctant to talk much about her adventure in gender, since she has said so much before. But I wonder simply if she has a sense of a before and after in the voice of her writing?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think my writing changed that much,\u201d she says. \u201cExcept that perhaps I became a little more relaxed about it.\u201d</p> <p>She gets up from her chair, remembering something.</p> <p>\u201cI found a book the other day, which I thought might interest you.

The recently discovered notebook she shows me, is full of all her \u2013 or James Morris\u2019s \u2013 original plans and schemes for the books: a carefully handwritten catalogue of dates and events, with sections on ideologies, politics, wars, cross-referenced to every nation under British rule. \u201cI look at something like this and I think \u2018Can that really have been me?\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>It feels like somebody else\u2019s work?</p> <p>\u201cIt certainly does! I can\u2019t fathom it. My tendency has been to jump in and tell stories. I had forgotten all of this.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/pax-britannica-9780571290710.html\" title=\"\">Pax Britannica</a> trilogy demands the adjective \u201cmagisterial\u201d more readily than just about any other series of books I can think of. It begins with the birth of Victorian ambition and ends with the death of Churchill. Written with all Morris\u2019s characteristic brio it is a compulsive exploration of patriotism, of manly endeavour, which ends in elegiac retreat and submission. Morris began the books as James and ended them as Jan; I wonder if that trajectory of tone in her history reflected that great change in her own life?</p> <p>Perhaps, Morris suggests, and shrugs. \u201cBut I should say I would never use the word change, as in \u201csex-change\u201d for what happened to me. I did not change sex, I really absorbed one into the other. I\u2019m a bit of each now. I freely admit it. There is obviously all of this debate about it all at the moment, but for me it was never a black and white thing. Never could be. It was a sort of instinct. A question of spirit almost. But that\u2019s all in that book I wrote, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>At one point in <em>Conundrum</em>, written in 1974, Morris wonders whether she might be simply ahead of her time, a premonition of gender fluidity to come. Whatever the case, she had a certainty about her \u201cslow motion Jekyll and Hyde\u201d that was all her own. When the transformation was complete in Casablanca, she writes \u201cI had reached Identity\u201d with a capital I. (Elsewhere she described it as \u201cAt-one-ment\u201d). She pictures herself as Ariel, \u201ca figure of fable and allegory\u201d in pursuit of the \u201chigher ideal that there is neither man nor woman\u201d. Had the possibility of safe surgery not existed, she had no doubt she would \u201cbribe barbers or abortionists, I would take a knife and do it myself, without fear, without qualms, without a second thought\u201d.</p> <p>There is a wonderful moment in that book when she returned to Wales and went to the local shop for the first time as Jan. No one who knew her batted an eyelid, and very few have done since. Has she been surprised?</p> <p>\u201cI put it down to kindness,\u201d she says. \u201cJust that. Everything good in the world is kindness. Though the only person who ever uses that word in politics is the prime minister of New Zealand [Jacinda Ardern]. She is tremendous isn\u2019t she? I\u2019d like to meet her.\u201d</p> <p>Morris\u2019s recent diaries are too wise to get bogged down in identity politics, and the disruptions of Brexit and Trump only rarely invade her thoughts. Once again, she offers a simple solution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e615daab61341a75062ac19944d1973ec69ad2c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e615daab61341a75062ac19944d1973ec69ad2c1/0_130_3729_2415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morris discusses Conundrum, one of the first autobiographies to explore personal gender reassignment, on the Dick Cavett show in the US, 1974\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morris discusses Conundrum, one of the first autobiographies to explore personal gender reassignment, on the Dick Cavett show in the US, 1974.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC Photo Archives/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you are not sure what you think about something, the most useful questions are these,\u201d she says. \u201cAre you being kind? Are they being kind? That usually gives you the answer.\u201d</p> <p>She gets up from the sofa, inviting me to come and see the rest of the house. On bookcases and on desks and tables there are wooden scale models of ships from all over the world \u2013 those on the bookshelves relate to the books behind them \u2013 a sampan for books about south-east Asia and so on. On either side of the doorway are two bardic chairs awarded to Twm at Eisteddfods. On the ceiling there is the painted \u201ceye of a poet\u201d looking down.</p> <p>Propped against one wall is a photograph of the summit of Everest taken by the Indian air force who flew over the expedition as it made its last assault on the summit. Morris points out the place she climbed to at 22,000 feet. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a bad story was it?\u201d</p> <p>I get her to remind me of the bones of it just to hear her tell it. When she was assigned by the <em>Times</em>, which sponsored the ascent, she had never climbed any mountain before. They had to work out a way of protecting their scoop and get it into the paper in time for the Queen\u2019s coronation. Having hugged Hillary in congratulation, Morris scrambled down an ice field and sent a wire overnight with a pre-coded message. It read: \u201cSnow conditions bad stop advanced base abandoned yesterday stop awaiting improvement.\u201d This meant: \u201cSummit of Everest reached on 29 May by Hillary and Tenzing.\u201d Morris made a lot of friendships on the mountain and they all stayed in touch for the rest of their lives. She is now the last survivor from that last camp.</p> <p>Upstairs, we are joined once again by the tap-tapping bird at the window. Morris points out the huge pen-and-ink drawing she did of the islands of Venice, on which if you look very closely you can see their son Henry heading back from school over the Accademia bridge, in the days when they lived in the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f43ffb9bb4c6ef63610e6a36a3c8c57cab3af21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f43ffb9bb4c6ef63610e6a36a3c8c57cab3af21/162_112_2067_2798/739.jpg\" alt=\"Jan Morris, Travel writer, authoress.

I love him dearly.\u201d</p> <p>Over the years, ever since Sir Robin Day bluntly asked Morris about her sex life in an interview on the BBC (about which she formally complained), she has batted away questions of lust, which she suggests has never been her thing. Part of that deflection has centred on her lifelong crush on the most unattainable of pin-ups: Admiral Jack Fisher, charismatic First Sea Lord of the British fleet in the Great War, a man who died six years before Morris was born.</p> <p>Morris wrote <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/fisher-s-face-9780571233045.html\" title=\"\">a book about Fisher</a> in 2007<strong>,</strong> in which she noted that \u201cI first set eyes on him in a photograph some time in the late 1940s, and knew at once that he was the man for me.\u201d That image went with her up Everest in 1953 and on every adventure that followed. She ushers me into her bedroom where there is a poster-sized photograph of Fisher on the back of the wardrobe door and points outside to a small balcony where there are twin sculpted busts \u2013 one of her head, one of the admiral\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cHe is devilishly handsome,\u201d I suggest.</p> <p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we will have our affair.\u201d</p> <p>As she describes her writing life Morris admits to the selfishness that made it possible to undertake her great voyages of self-discovery. In a less than kind review of <em>Conundrum </em>when it came out in 1974, Germaine Greer, essaying misgivings about gender change that persist, wrote that \u201cas Jan Morris plucks at your sleeve for a girlish heart to heart, you wonder about Elizabeth. Her unbroken silence is the truest measure of Jan Morris\u2019s enduring masculinity.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth was moved to respond to Greer, writing: \u201cI am not very silent and certainly not anguished. The children and I not only love Jan very dearly but are very proud of her.\u201d</p> <p>Jan and Elizabeth reaffirmed that love in a civil union ceremony in Pwllheli in 2008, witnessed by a local couple who invited them to tea at their house afterwards. \u201cI made my marriage vows 59 years ago and still have them,\u201d Elizabeth said at the time. \u201cAfter Jan had a sex change we had to divorce. It did not make any difference to me. We still had our family. We just carried on.\u201d</p> <p>When they sold the big house the couple retained a small island in the neighbouring Dwyfor river where, in the manner of Welsh princes and poets, their ashes will be scattered together. The place will be marked with a slate headstone that is currently stored in a cupboard under the stairs, reading: \u201cHere lie two friends, at the end of one life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71b612a7e2b872a845f79e28b05e091f28bf86a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71b612a7e2b872a845f79e28b05e091f28bf86a8/0_142_3600_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jan Morris with the Duke of Edinburgh in 2013 during a reception to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Hillary\u2019s ascent of Everest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With the Duke of Edinburgh in 2013 during a reception to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Hillary\u2019s ascent of Everest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We walk around the house in order to see the statues of Admiral Jack and Jan staring into eternity on their pedestals, and Morris apologises for a fleeting lapse in memory as I question her a bit more about her fantasy man.</p> <p>\u201cI am sorry to be so indistinct,\u201d she says. \u201cThe truth is, you are talking to someone at the very end of things. I felt that first about two years ago. I felt it creeping up, and now I know I am approaching the end.\u201d She has written elsewhere about how her spirit will haunt two places in particular \u2013 the banks of the river Dwyfor and the seafront in Trieste. I wonder whether she still thinks that. \u201cDeath?\u201d she says. \u201cI think of it as a blank.\u201d</p> <p>Apart from Jack Fisher?</p> <p>\u201cApart from Jack Fisher!\u201d</p> <p>We sit inside for a while at the long table that dominates the kitchen, eating some sandwiches for lunch that Twm has left under tinfoil. There is an Aga, and a Welsh dresser and a low shelf on which are arranged seven pots of homemade marmalade, a different one for each day of the week, which now represent Morris\u2019s principal vice (up until two years ago she claimed to have drunk at least a glass of wine every day since the second world war, but has lapsed a little now).</p> <p>I suggest that there must be a part of her restless soul that misses the travel. Can she revisit those worlds by reading her own books?</p> <p>\u201cI ashamed to say I do read my own books quite a bit,\u201d she says, and laughs. \u201cThere are one or two good things. But then you also feel, oh do please stop going on\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Does she ever feel hemmed in here?</p> <p>\u201cNever, no. The sea is just over there. I wouldn\u2019t want to be entirely in the mountains. I go down to the sea most days. I suppose the day will come when I cannot drive the Honda. Then I suppose I will have to walk it.\u201d</p> <p>Is she still managing to do her thousand daily steps?</p> <p>\u201cI try. Quite often now it is a bit too much for me. But I try to do some exercise every day, the gods insist on it.\u201d</p> <p>There is a lovely diary entry in the current book in which, with the weather raging outside, she determines to do her thousand steps indoors: \u201cround and about the sofas I whistled my way, never pausing, left, right, left right\u2026 counting the paces on my fingers and sometimes bursting into song, until at last, breathless but triumphant, I reached the millennium on my thumb.\u201d</p> <p>She is whistling an old show tune now while she is making coffee. I am reminded of the fact that for her <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00d9yb6\" title=\"\">Desert Island Discs</a></em> with Sue Lawley all of Morris\u2019s choices were songs by Irving Berlin. This went back to Morris\u2019s first job as a trainee reporter on the <em>Western Daily Press</em> aged 16. She was sent to Bristol docks to meet a big band sent to entertain the US troops stationed there during the war. Berlin was with them. \u201cHe was terribly kind to me. So I have always thought of him ever since as the ideal American. I\u2019ve always loved his songs anyway.\u201d</p> <p>To prove the point, standing at the kitchen sink, Morris breaks into one of them. The voice that won her a choral scholarship to Oxford as a boy is cracked a bit now, but she can still carry a tune. The song is from the film <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVoQGDhLlaE\" title=\"\">This </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVoQGDhLlaE\" title=\"\">Is the Army</a></em>, and she cuts to the rousing chorus, in marching time:</p> <p>Someday I\u2019m going to murder the bugler!<br>Someday they\u2019re going to find him dead!<br>And then I\u2019ll get that other pup<br>The guy who wakes the bugler up<br>And then spend the rest of my life in bed!<br></p> <p>\u201cI find myself whistling that many mornings these days,\u201d Morris says, \u201cbut then I always get up, of course.\u201d She pauses for a bit, and concentrates on sorting out the kettle and the coffee and the mugs and the milk and takes care in bringing all of it over to the table. \u201cLife has its problems,\u201d she says, with a half-smile. \u201cBut it also has its delights.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Thinking Again</em> by Jan Morris is published by Faber, \u00a316.99.

      "bodyText": "Trefan Morys is a low 18th-century barn, stone-built, slate-roofed, topped with a weather vane and surrounded by a dense tangle of garden beneath a towering elm tree. Jan Morris has lived here, halfway up a hill in the top-left corner of Wales, with Elizabeth, once her wife, now her civil partner, for the past 30 years. Before that they had raised their four children in the big manor house a little further down the lane toward Criccieth and the coast. Like everything about Jan Morris\u2019s long and unique life there is a kind of storytellers\u2019 magic to Trefan Morys. Last week, I drove up through Snowdonia and down toward the Irish Sea, to listen to some of Morris\u2019s myths and legends, while the last of storm Dennis rattled outside. Hearing about most lives you have a sense of beginnings and middles and ends, but Morris\u2019s 93 years resist very much in the way of this-led-to-that. It is a life that forms instead around improbable adventures a million miles from here \u2013 Morris, at 26, was the only journalist to accompany Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay on their 1953 ascent of Everest; at other times she wrote about living on Field Marshal Montgomery\u2019s family houseboat on the Nile, and in a palazzo on the Grand Canal; she met Che Guevara in Cuba; she visited Hiroshima after the bomb, and reported on the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961. In her dreamy books about cities \u2013 most memorably Venice and Trieste \u2013 the world can seem a permanent Xanadu. These unlikely journeys are nothing, though, in some ways, beside the defining romantic quest of her life. Jan Morris was born James Humphrey Morris on 2 October 1926, in Somerset. As she recalled in her memoir, Conundrum, \u201cI was three or perhaps four when I realised that I had been born into the wrong body, and should really be a girl.\u201d She was under a piano at the time, listening to her mother play Sibelius. Conundrum detailed a pioneering journey across a perilous internal border. A journey that involved years of hormone therapy and culminated in reassignment surgery in Casablanca in 1972, before a return here, to Llanystumdwy, to Elizabeth and to their children. From the vantage of 93, some of this life has started to seem like a foreign country to Morris. She still lives with Elizabeth, who suffers from dementia. Their youngest son, Twm, a poet, writing in Welsh, lives in a cottage across the road and \u201cis a miracle\u201d, Morris says, in the help he gives them. Jan does not travel very far these days, though her trusty Honda Sport R still sits ready for action on the gravel outside. Her books have shrunk in scope, too. The last two, the bestselling In My Mind\u2019s Eye and her new book, Thinking Again, are composed of daily diary entries that unlock Morris\u2019s storehouse of memory as they describe children in coffee shops or dogs on the beach at Pwllheli. The pace of those books is set by the 1,000 daily steps up and down the lane outside that she commits to as an exercise regime, and the marching tunes that she whistles as she goes. The tone is of someone who has seen the whole world and decided on this place as an ending. In the long, beamed sitting room of Trefan Morys, we talk first about the house itself. When they all lived down the road, the kids used to come and play here in the stables, overgrown with bramble. Later Jan and Elizabeth felt the big house was unmanageable, so they found a buyer, cleared out the horse stalls here, brought the books and bookcases from the other place, along with the weather vane, renovated and moved in. In the final diary entry of Thinking Again, Morris dwells on \u201chiraeth\u201d that Welsh word that is often translated as nostalgia, but which she \u2013 half-Welsh, half-English, another hybrid \u2013 feels more like a national addiction to longing. \u201cIt is a different thing for Twm, for example,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have his instinct for Welshness, with him it is more basic, it comes out of the soil, for me it is more an idea.\u201d While we talk, from time to time a small fluttering bird taps its beak on the window as if to gain entry. \u201cDo you hear the bird tapping?\u201d Morris asks. \u201cIt used to portend death didn\u2019t it? We have it every day at different windows.\u201d The tapping of the bird leads Morris into the first of a few apologies that she no longer has the eloquence she once did as an interviewee. \u201cSometimes I fear I am not exactly compos mentis,\u201d she says. \u201cIt comes and goes. Like with Elizabeth. The other morning I was taking her breakfast on a tray and I fell, and there were cornflakes everywhere, and marmalade. I thought, well no good asking Elizabeth to help with this. But she came out, and miraculously was transformed into the real Elizabeth, and briskly helped me clear it all up beautifully. I said to her a few minutes later how encouraging she can still do that, but she could not remember what had happened.\u201d Morris looks around her bookshelves, the thousands of books that line this long room floor to ceiling. \u201cPeople always say: \u2018Have you read them all?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cNo. but I have an emotional attachment to them all. I pick an old book out and if it is interesting I read a few pages. I put letters and photographs and cards in them to find later.\u201d Does she still get a lot of correspondence? \u201cMostly from people who go to Trieste or Venice and read my books, and say \u2018What did you mean by that\u2019? To be honest I\u2019m not always sure.\u201d As a wandering writer \u2013 she is widely acclaimed for inventing a way of writing about cities that blends history and imaginative description and a sort of psychology of place \u2013 Morris made much of herself being an outsider. In Conundrum she wondered whether her \u201cincessant wandering\u201d as a journalist for the Times and the Guardian and freelance \u201chad been an outward expression of my inner journey\u201d. She has resisted the idea of biography, though she allowed Derek Johns, her former agent, to write her literary life, Ariel. In it he notes at one point how \u201cit is interesting to consider that the move from male to female and the move from Englishness to Welshness were roughly concurrent\u201d. She herself has suggested that she always favoured the \u201csoft side\u201d of her character more than \u201cthe hard side\u201d, and that Wales was closer to that softness. She is reluctant to talk much about her adventure in gender, since she has said so much before. But I wonder simply if she has a sense of a before and after in the voice of her writing? \u201cI don\u2019t think my writing changed that much,\u201d she says. \u201cExcept that perhaps I became a little more relaxed about it.\u201d She gets up from her chair, remembering something. \u201cI found a book the other day, which I thought might interest you. It was about the trilogy of books which was the centrepiece of my life really, I hesitate to say intellectually, but certainly emotionally.\u201d This was the trilogy about the rise and fall of the British empire, which Morris wrote over a period of 10 years, beginning in 1968. The recently discovered notebook she shows me, is full of all her \u2013 or James Morris\u2019s \u2013 original plans and schemes for the books: a carefully handwritten catalogue of dates and events, with sections on ideologies, politics, wars, cross-referenced to every nation under British rule. \u201cI look at something like this and I think \u2018Can that really have been me?\u2019\u201d she says. It feels like somebody else\u2019s work? \u201cIt certainly does! I can\u2019t fathom it. My tendency has been to jump in and tell stories. I had forgotten all of this.\u201d The Pax Britannica trilogy demands the adjective \u201cmagisterial\u201d more readily than just about any other series of books I can think of. It begins with the birth of Victorian ambition and ends with the death of Churchill. Written with all Morris\u2019s characteristic brio it is a compulsive exploration of patriotism, of manly endeavour, which ends in elegiac retreat and submission. Morris began the books as James and ended them as Jan; I wonder if that trajectory of tone in her history reflected that great change in her own life? Perhaps, Morris suggests, and shrugs. \u201cBut I should say I would never use the word change, as in \u201csex-change\u201d for what happened to me. I did not change sex, I really absorbed one into the other. I\u2019m a bit of each now. I freely admit it. There is obviously all of this debate about it all at the moment, but for me it was never a black and white thing. Never could be. It was a sort of instinct. A question of spirit almost. But that\u2019s all in that book I wrote, isn\u2019t it?\u201d At one point in Conundrum, written in 1974, Morris wonders whether she might be simply ahead of her time, a premonition of gender fluidity to come. Whatever the case, she had a certainty about her \u201cslow motion Jekyll and Hyde\u201d that was all her own. When the transformation was complete in Casablanca, she writes \u201cI had reached Identity\u201d with a capital I. (Elsewhere she described it as \u201cAt-one-ment\u201d). She pictures herself as Ariel, \u201ca figure of fable and allegory\u201d in pursuit of the \u201chigher ideal that there is neither man nor woman\u201d. Had the possibility of safe surgery not existed, she had no doubt she would \u201cbribe barbers or abortionists, I would take a knife and do it myself, without fear, without qualms, without a second thought\u201d. There is a wonderful moment in that book when she returned to Wales and went to the local shop for the first time as Jan. No one who knew her batted an eyelid, and very few have done since. Has she been surprised? \u201cI put it down to kindness,\u201d she says. \u201cJust that. Everything good in the world is kindness. Though the only person who ever uses that word in politics is the prime minister of New Zealand [Jacinda Ardern]. She is tremendous isn\u2019t she? I\u2019d like to meet her.\u201d Morris\u2019s recent diaries are too wise to get bogged down in identity politics, and the disruptions of Brexit and Trump only rarely invade her thoughts. Once again, she offers a simple solution. \u201cIf you are not sure what you think about something, the most useful questions are these,\u201d she says. \u201cAre you being kind? Are they being kind? That usually gives you the answer.\u201d She gets up from the sofa, inviting me to come and see the rest of the house. On bookcases and on desks and tables there are wooden scale models of ships from all over the world \u2013 those on the bookshelves relate to the books behind them \u2013 a sampan for books about south-east Asia and so on. On either side of the doorway are two bardic chairs awarded to Twm at Eisteddfods. On the ceiling there is the painted \u201ceye of a poet\u201d looking down. Propped against one wall is a photograph of the summit of Everest taken by the Indian air force who flew over the expedition as it made its last assault on the summit. Morris points out the place she climbed to at 22,000 feet. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a bad story was it?\u201d I get her to remind me of the bones of it just to hear her tell it. When she was assigned by the Times, which sponsored the ascent, she had never climbed any mountain before. They had to work out a way of protecting their scoop and get it into the paper in time for the Queen\u2019s coronation. Having hugged Hillary in congratulation, Morris scrambled down an ice field and sent a wire overnight with a pre-coded message. It read: \u201cSnow conditions bad stop advanced base abandoned yesterday stop awaiting improvement.\u201d This meant: \u201cSummit of Everest reached on 29 May by Hillary and Tenzing.\u201d Morris made a lot of friendships on the mountain and they all stayed in touch for the rest of their lives. She is now the last survivor from that last camp. Upstairs, we are joined once again by the tap-tapping bird at the window. Morris points out the huge pen-and-ink drawing she did of the islands of Venice, on which if you look very closely you can see their son Henry heading back from school over the Accademia bridge, in the days when they lived in the city. In one corner of the loft room is Morris\u2019s desk \u2013 \u201cwhere the magic happens\u201d \u2013 and behind it on the wall a portrait of a man in naval uniform. \u201cJack Fisher,\u201d Morris says. \u201cI am going to have an affair with him in the afterlife. I love him dearly.\u201d Over the years, ever since Sir Robin Day bluntly asked Morris about her sex life in an interview on the BBC (about which she formally complained), she has batted away questions of lust, which she suggests has never been her thing. Part of that deflection has centred on her lifelong crush on the most unattainable of pin-ups: Admiral Jack Fisher, charismatic First Sea Lord of the British fleet in the Great War, a man who died six years before Morris was born. Morris wrote a book about Fisher in 2007, in which she noted that \u201cI first set eyes on him in a photograph some time in the late 1940s, and knew at once that he was the man for me.\u201d That image went with her up Everest in 1953 and on every adventure that followed. She ushers me into her bedroom where there is a poster-sized photograph of Fisher on the back of the wardrobe door and points outside to a small balcony where there are twin sculpted busts \u2013 one of her head, one of the admiral\u2019s. \u201cHe is devilishly handsome,\u201d I suggest. \u201cNo it\u2019s not that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we will have our affair.\u201d As she describes her writing life Morris admits to the selfishness that made it possible to undertake her great voyages of self-discovery. In a less than kind review of Conundrum when it came out in 1974, Germaine Greer, essaying misgivings about gender change that persist, wrote that \u201cas Jan Morris plucks at your sleeve for a girlish heart to heart, you wonder about Elizabeth. Her unbroken silence is the truest measure of Jan Morris\u2019s enduring masculinity.\u201d Elizabeth was moved to respond to Greer, writing: \u201cI am not very silent and certainly not anguished. The children and I not only love Jan very dearly but are very proud of her.\u201d Jan and Elizabeth reaffirmed that love in a civil union ceremony in Pwllheli in 2008, witnessed by a local couple who invited them to tea at their house afterwards. \u201cI made my marriage vows 59 years ago and still have them,\u201d Elizabeth said at the time. \u201cAfter Jan had a sex change we had to divorce. It did not make any difference to me. We still had our family. We just carried on.\u201d When they sold the big house the couple retained a small island in the neighbouring Dwyfor river where, in the manner of Welsh princes and poets, their ashes will be scattered together. The place will be marked with a slate headstone that is currently stored in a cupboard under the stairs, reading: \u201cHere lie two friends, at the end of one life.\u201d We walk around the house in order to see the statues of Admiral Jack and Jan staring into eternity on their pedestals, and Morris apologises for a fleeting lapse in memory as I question her a bit more about her fantasy man. \u201cI am sorry to be so indistinct,\u201d she says. \u201cThe truth is, you are talking to someone at the very end of things. I felt that first about two years ago. I felt it creeping up, and now I know I am approaching the end.\u201d She has written elsewhere about how her spirit will haunt two places in particular \u2013 the banks of the river Dwyfor and the seafront in Trieste. I wonder whether she still thinks that. \u201cDeath?\u201d she says. \u201cI think of it as a blank.\u201d Apart from Jack Fisher? \u201cApart from Jack Fisher!\u201d We sit inside for a while at the long table that dominates the kitchen, eating some sandwiches for lunch that Twm has left under tinfoil. There is an Aga, and a Welsh dresser and a low shelf on which are arranged seven pots of homemade marmalade, a different one for each day of the week, which now represent Morris\u2019s principal vice (up until two years ago she claimed to have drunk at least a glass of wine every day since the second world war, but has lapsed a little now). I suggest that there must be a part of her restless soul that misses the travel. Can she revisit those worlds by reading her own books? \u201cI ashamed to say I do read my own books quite a bit,\u201d she says, and laughs. \u201cThere are one or two good things. But then you also feel, oh do please stop going on\u2026\u201d Does she ever feel hemmed in here? \u201cNever, no. The sea is just over there. I wouldn\u2019t want to be entirely in the mountains. I go down to the sea most days. I suppose the day will come when I cannot drive the Honda. Then I suppose I will have to walk it.\u201d Is she still managing to do her thousand daily steps? \u201cI try. Quite often now it is a bit too much for me. But I try to do some exercise every day, the gods insist on it.\u201d There is a lovely diary entry in the current book in which, with the weather raging outside, she determines to do her thousand steps indoors: \u201cround and about the sofas I whistled my way, never pausing, left, right, left right\u2026 counting the paces on my fingers and sometimes bursting into song, until at last, breathless but triumphant, I reached the millennium on my thumb.\u201d She is whistling an old show tune now while she is making coffee. I am reminded of the fact that for her Desert Island Discs with Sue Lawley all of Morris\u2019s choices were songs by Irving Berlin. This went back to Morris\u2019s first job as a trainee reporter on the Western Daily Press aged 16. She was sent to Bristol docks to meet a big band sent to entertain the US troops stationed there during the war. Berlin was with them. \u201cHe was terribly kind to me. So I have always thought of him ever since as the ideal American. I\u2019ve always loved his songs anyway.\u201d To prove the point, standing at the kitchen sink, Morris breaks into one of them. The voice that won her a choral scholarship to Oxford as a boy is cracked a bit now, but she can still carry a tune. The song is from the film This Is the Army, and she cuts to the rousing chorus, in marching time: Someday I\u2019m going to murder the bugler! Someday they\u2019re going to find him dead! And then I\u2019ll get that other pup The guy who wakes the bugler up And then spend the rest of my life in bed! \u201cI find myself whistling that many mornings these days,\u201d Morris says, \u201cbut then I always get up, of course.\u201d She pauses for a bit, and concentrates on sorting out the kettle and the coffee and the mugs and the milk and takes care in bringing all of it over to the table. \u201cLife has its problems,\u201d she says, with a half-smile. \u201cBut it also has its delights.\u201d \u2022 Thinking Again by Jan Morris is published by Faber, \u00a316.99.

I\u2019m passionate about early education, and I do wonder why I\u2019m still having to make the argument for it.\u201d A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise the importance of maintained nursery schools \u2026 particularly in disadvantaged areas. We are providing around \u00a360m of supplementary funding during the 2020-21 financial year.\u201d The government was committed to funding maintained nurseries in the longer term, she said, but declined to comment on how much funding the government will provide beyond the 2020-21 financial year.",

He will be delivering his budget just four weeks after being appointed, with a powerful No 10 apparently indifferent to keeping control of the public finances, in a government that is pursuing a growth-damaging Brexit policy and in the midst of a health crisis that makes all short-term economic forecasts a matter of guesswork. It is quite a baptism of fire.\u201d</p> <p>Stewart Wood, who worked on six budgets when serving as an adviser to Gordon Brown, said the timing of last week\u2019s market meltdown created a planning nightmare for the Treasury.</p> <p>Lord Wood said: \u201cWith 10 days to go, the OBR\u2019s forecasts and spending envelope will normally have been locked down by now. The Treasury may have to rip up the plans its budget has been based on and hastily assemble a new plan B, to ensure the chancellor\u2019s statement on 11 March fits the situation we are in, rather than the situation we would have been in before the Corona crash.\u201d</p> <p>In a newspaper interview Javid said he had been planning an income-tax cut and a network of electric car-charging stations for inclusion in the budget. Sunak will also be under pressure from Downing Street to deliver on the Tories\u2019 post-election promises to \u201clevel up\u201d the country.</p> <p>Local government leaders and charities are also calling on the Treasury to provide urgent funding for adult social care services across England. According to Age UK, between 2010 to 2019 spending on adult social care services fell by \u00a386m in real terms, representing a 4% cut in local authority spending. Age UK estimates that hospitals delaying discharges of elderly people, due to a lack of social care, cost the NHS \u00a3500 every minute.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the all-party business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said Sunak should deliver a bold budget amid the uncertainty. She said: \u201cThe coronavirus, flooding, Brexit and warnings about a big hit to economic growth have put businesses and households under huge pressure. But now is not the moment for a safety-first budget.</p> <p>\u201cThe chancellor must not use this uncertainty as an excuse to further delay the investment that the north and our public services so badly need. The country would never forgive a chancellor who sits on his hands when we are facing a national emergency.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak will have to rethink key parts of the budget next week because of growing fears that the spread of the coronavirus will trigger a global economic downturn, economists, former government ministers and advisers have warned. Sunak, who was installed as chancellor less than three weeks ago following the resignation of Sajid Javid, was already engaged in a race against time to deliver his first budget on 11 March \u2013 the date set by his predecessor. But with the spread of the virus wreaking havoc on the financial markets and raising fears of an economic downturn that would in turn cut tax revenues to the exchequer, his task has suddenly became far harder, say experts. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said that economic forecasts \u2013 drawn up by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) \u2013 would need to be presented with a strong health warning. \u201cWhether the OBR has had time to include the likely impact of the virus into its forecasts or not, the chancellor will need to say how it creates further uncertainty,\u201d he said. Johnson also believes steep stock market falls last week could knock capital gains tax receipts and depress the revenue the government was expecting from stamp duty on share buying. \u201cThere is also going to be a hit to growth,\u201d he said. Writing in today\u2019s Observer, former Treasury minister and Tory MP David Gauke said the budget would have to be recast at a late stage to take into account the unpredictable economic outlook. \u201cGiven the uncertainties, the OBR is likely to qualify its economic forecasts,\u201d Gauke writes. \u201cThis does not make the task of the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, any easier. He will be delivering his budget just four weeks after being appointed, with a powerful No 10 apparently indifferent to keeping control of the public finances, in a government that is pursuing a growth-damaging Brexit policy and in the midst of a health crisis that makes all short-term economic forecasts a matter of guesswork. It is quite a baptism of fire.\u201d Stewart Wood, who worked on six budgets when serving as an adviser to Gordon Brown, said the timing of last week\u2019s market meltdown created a planning nightmare for the Treasury. Lord Wood said: \u201cWith 10 days to go, the OBR\u2019s forecasts and spending envelope will normally have been locked down by now. The Treasury may have to rip up the plans its budget has been based on and hastily assemble a new plan B, to ensure the chancellor\u2019s statement on 11 March fits the situation we are in, rather than the situation we would have been in before the Corona crash.\u201d In a newspaper interview Javid said he had been planning an income-tax cut and a network of electric car-charging stations for inclusion in the budget. Sunak will also be under pressure from Downing Street to deliver on the Tories\u2019 post-election promises to \u201clevel up\u201d the country. Local government leaders and charities are also calling on the Treasury to provide urgent funding for adult social care services across England. According to Age UK, between 2010 to 2019 spending on adult social care services fell by \u00a386m in real terms, representing a 4% cut in local authority spending. Age UK estimates that hospitals delaying discharges of elderly people, due to a lack of social care, cost the NHS \u00a3500 every minute. Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the all-party business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said Sunak should deliver a bold budget amid the uncertainty. She said: \u201cThe coronavirus, flooding, Brexit and warnings about a big hit to economic growth have put businesses and households under huge pressure. But now is not the moment for a safety-first budget. \u201cThe chancellor must not use this uncertainty as an excuse to further delay the investment that the north and our public services so badly need. The country would never forgive a chancellor who sits on his hands when we are facing a national emergency.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>High street coffee shop giant Starbucks has been caught up in a child labour row after an investigation revealed that children under 13 were working on farms in Guatemala that supply the chain with its beans.</p> <p>Channel 4\u2019s <em>Dispatches</em> filmed the children working 40-hour weeks in gruelling conditions, picking coffee for a daily wage little more than the price of a latte. The beans are also supplied to Nespresso, owned by Nestl\u00e9. Last week, actor George Clooney, the advertising face of Nespresso, praised the investigation and said he was saddened by its findings.</p> <p>The <em>Dispatches</em> team said some of the children, who worked around eight hours a day, six days a week, looked as young as eight. They, were paid depending on the weight of beans they picked, with sacks weighing up to 45kg. Typically, a child would earn less than \u00a35 a day, although sometimes it could be as low as 31p an hour.</p> <p>Over the course of the investigation, <em>Dispatches</em> visited seven farms linked to Nespresso and five linked to Starbucks. Child labour was found on all the farms.</p> <p>A human rights lawyer who viewed some of the programme\u2019s evidence suggested both companies were in breach of international labour regulations laid down by the UN\u2019s International Labour Organization.</p> <p>\u201cThe conventions are very clear in that they don\u2019t want children\u2019s education to be compromised,\u201d said Oliver Holland of solicitors Leigh Day. \u201cIf children are working 40 hours a week, there is no way they can also be having a proper education.</p> <p>\u201cThese are all unsafe conditions for children essentially, and in those conditions children simply shouldn\u2019t be working.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c5f66eb552ddb6e547fd95122d4629ce9695fcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c5f66eb552ddb6e547fd95122d4629ce9695fcb/0_8_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Clooney is the marketing face of Nespresso.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Clooney is the marketing face of Nespresso.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nespresso</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Dispatches</em> calculated that of \u00a32.50 spent on a typical cup of coffee on the high street, the shop receives 88p. Staff receive 63p and 38p goes on tax. A profit of 25p goes to the coffee company \u2013 such as Starbucks, which has an annual global revenue of more than \u00a320bn, and has nearly 1,000 shops in the UK alone.</p> <p>After other costs are accounted for, 10p is left for the coffee suppliers, of which 1p goes to the farmer, who uses a fraction of this to pay coffee pickers.</p> <p><em>Dispatches</em> reporter Antony Barnett shared some of the evidence with Clooney. Last week, the Hollywood star, who sits on Nespresso\u2019s sustainability advisory board, said: \u201cI was surprised and saddened to see this story. Clearly this board and this company still have work to do. And that work will be done. I would hope that this reporter will continue to investigate these conditions and report accurately if they do not improve.</p> <p>\u201cThe check and balance of good corporate responsibility lies not just with the company itself but also independent journalists like Mr Barnett to hold everyone\u2019s promise to account.\u201d</p> <p>Nespresso\u2019s chief executive, Guillaume Le Cunff, said: \u201cNespresso has zero tolerance of child labour. It is unacceptable. Where there are claims that our high standards are not met, we act immediately. In this case, we\u2019ve launched a thorough investigation to find out which farms were filmed and whether they supply Nespresso. We will not resume purchases of coffee from farms in this area until the investigation is closed. Any issues we uncover will be dealt with diligently and firm action will be taken.\u201d</p> <p>Starbucks also said it had a \u201czero tolerance for child labour anywhere in our supply chain\u201d. It told <em>Dispatches</em>: \u201cWe\u2019ve launched a full investigation into the claims brought by Channel 4, carried out in partnership with a leading third-party auditor.\u201d</p> <p>Starbucks has since said that its investigation confirmed \u201cwe have not purchased coffee from the farms in question during the most recent harvest season\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe remain concerned and are taking action due to the fact that these farms were verified in 2019 against our ethical sourcing standards, which are the most comprehensive in the coffee industry,\u201d said Michelle Burns, Starbucks global head of coffee.</p> <p>Barnett said: \u201cIt\u2019s great that George Clooney supports our investigation but if he is serious about sorting out this issue, he needs to make sure Nespresso puts its money where its mouth is. It\u2019s far too easy to announce an investigation and halt supplies from these regions but this will further punish the farmers and desperately poor families who rely on them. The reason these kids are working is that their parents \u2013 and the farms they work on \u2013 are not paid enough.\u201c</p> <p><em>Dispatches will air on Monday at 8pm.</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated on 1 March 2020 to include a statement from Starbucks that was received by the Guardian after publication. The headline was also amended in light of the statement.</p>",

      "bodyText": "High street coffee shop giant Starbucks has been caught up in a child labour row after an investigation revealed that children under 13 were working on farms in Guatemala that supply the chain with its beans. Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches filmed the children working 40-hour weeks in gruelling conditions, picking coffee for a daily wage little more than the price of a latte. The beans are also supplied to Nespresso, owned by Nestl\u00e9. Last week, actor George Clooney, the advertising face of Nespresso, praised the investigation and said he was saddened by its findings. The Dispatches team said some of the children, who worked around eight hours a day, six days a week, looked as young as eight. They, were paid depending on the weight of beans they picked, with sacks weighing up to 45kg. Typically, a child would earn less than \u00a35 a day, although sometimes it could be as low as 31p an hour. Over the course of the investigation, Dispatches visited seven farms linked to Nespresso and five linked to Starbucks. Child labour was found on all the farms. A human rights lawyer who viewed some of the programme\u2019s evidence suggested both companies were in breach of international labour regulations laid down by the UN\u2019s International Labour Organization. \u201cThe conventions are very clear in that they don\u2019t want children\u2019s education to be compromised,\u201d said Oliver Holland of solicitors Leigh Day. \u201cIf children are working 40 hours a week, there is no way they can also be having a proper education. \u201cThese are all unsafe conditions for children essentially, and in those conditions children simply shouldn\u2019t be working.\u201d Dispatches calculated that of \u00a32.50 spent on a typical cup of coffee on the high street, the shop receives 88p. Staff receive 63p and 38p goes on tax. A profit of 25p goes to the coffee company \u2013 such as Starbucks, which has an annual global revenue of more than \u00a320bn, and has nearly 1,000 shops in the UK alone. After other costs are accounted for, 10p is left for the coffee suppliers, of which 1p goes to the farmer, who uses a fraction of this to pay coffee pickers. Dispatches reporter Antony Barnett shared some of the evidence with Clooney. Last week, the Hollywood star, who sits on Nespresso\u2019s sustainability advisory board, said: \u201cI was surprised and saddened to see this story. Clearly this board and this company still have work to do. And that work will be done. I would hope that this reporter will continue to investigate these conditions and report accurately if they do not improve. \u201cThe check and balance of good corporate responsibility lies not just with the company itself but also independent journalists like Mr Barnett to hold everyone\u2019s promise to account.\u201d Nespresso\u2019s chief executive, Guillaume Le Cunff, said: \u201cNespresso has zero tolerance of child labour. It is unacceptable. Where there are claims that our high standards are not met, we act immediately. In this case, we\u2019ve launched a thorough investigation to find out which farms were filmed and whether they supply Nespresso. We will not resume purchases of coffee from farms in this area until the investigation is closed. Any issues we uncover will be dealt with diligently and firm action will be taken.\u201d Starbucks also said it had a \u201czero tolerance for child labour anywhere in our supply chain\u201d. It told Dispatches: \u201cWe\u2019ve launched a full investigation into the claims brought by Channel 4, carried out in partnership with a leading third-party auditor.\u201d Starbucks has since said that its investigation confirmed \u201cwe have not purchased coffee from the farms in question during the most recent harvest season\u201d. \u201cWe remain concerned and are taking action due to the fact that these farms were verified in 2019 against our ethical sourcing standards, which are the most comprehensive in the coffee industry,\u201d said Michelle Burns, Starbucks global head of coffee. Barnett said: \u201cIt\u2019s great that George Clooney supports our investigation but if he is serious about sorting out this issue, he needs to make sure Nespresso puts its money where its mouth is. It\u2019s far too easy to announce an investigation and halt supplies from these regions but this will further punish the farmers and desperately poor families who rely on them. The reason these kids are working is that their parents \u2013 and the farms they work on \u2013 are not paid enough.\u201c Dispatches will air on Monday at 8pm. \u2022 This article was updated on 1 March 2020 to include a statement from Starbucks that was received by the Guardian after publication. The headline was also amended in light of the statement.",

This year it focuses on the joy of sharing stories with others, but I feel sad about how necessary it is \u2013 and how surprised people often are to see Flora enjoying a book in public.</p> <p>When she reads in restaurants, for example, waiters tell me how rare it is to see a child immersed in a book, instead of glued to a phone. In small shops, she often quietly tucks herself away in a corner to read \u2013 and then, when I call her to leave the shop with me, the assistants will intervene and beg me not to disturb her further. \u201cLook at her, she\u2019s reading,\u201d they\u2019ll whisper to me, in a tone of wonder, as if I did not have eyes.</p> <p>At first, I found this quite strange. Flora\u2019s behaviour seems entirely normal to me \u2013 perhaps because I was a bookworm myself, as a child in the 1980s. I, too, had a torch and knew how to use it \u2013 and I remember having a few lamp-post encounters of my own. Like Flora, I could open a book and shut out everything that was happening around me. It was effortless and magical, and I think not that unusual at the time. A survey of children\u2019s reading habits from 1977 shows 75% of 10- to 14-year-olds in the UK were reading for pleasure. By 1999, when I was in my late teens, this figure had risen to 79%. </p> <p>But things are different now. And when Flora reads in public, it often attracts attention. Last summer, an elderly lady approached us in a park because she\u2019d noticed Flora sitting reading for nearly half an hour. \u201cIt\u2019s just not something you see nowadays,\u201d she said, beaming with happiness. \u201cI didn\u2019t think children read like that any more.\u201d</p> <p>Bookworms like Flora, it seems, are dying out. Research by the National Literacy Trust in today\u2019s <em>Observer </em>reveals that just over half (53%) of children read for pleasure in 2019, down from 59% in 2016. Only a quarter read daily, compared with 43% in 2015.

      "body": "<p>A skiing holiday with a partner who doesn\u2019t entirely share your passion or aptitude for the sport can be a challenge. But after a morning on easy runs in the Schlick 2000 ski area outside Innsbruck, my husband, Anthony, and I happily headed in different directions: me to the Serlesbahnen cable car for some more demanding powder runs, him into town for lunch and culture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8aaaf761bee9b0e090862fbe6cb45d05e35f8f7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8aaaf761bee9b0e090862fbe6cb45d05e35f8f7d/0_0_690_475/500.jpg\" alt=\"Innsbruck ski map\" width=\"500\" height=\"344\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We\u2019d come to Innsbruck because this season the Tirolean capital has launched an updated <a href=\"https://www.innsbruck.info/en/skiing/ski-plus-city-pass.html\" title=\"\">Ski plus City pass</a>, now covering 13 resorts all between 15 and 75 minutes from the city centre by tram, bus or train. It\u2019s great for skiers looking for variety, as well as for those who want to combine a bit of slope action with a city break: the pass includes entry to 22 museums and attractions. It seems odd to me that the <a href=\"https://www.ski-plus-city.com/en/\" title=\"\">Ski plus City website</a> doesn\u2019t list the train and tram connections, but they can easily be found at the national rail site, <a href=\"https://www.oebb.at/en/\" title=\"\">oebb.at</a>.</p> <p>Innsbruck can be reached comfortably by train from London, leaving St Pancras around midday, changing at Brussels or Amsterdam, then catching a sleeper in Cologne. A student city with lively bars dotted among elegant 18th-century townhouses, and trams rattling down cobbled streets, Innsbruck makes a fun base. Our hotel, <a href=\"https://www.stage12.at/en\" title=\"\">Stage 12</a>, was a modern hideaway in the old quarter, with a welcome sauna and a good cocktail bar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"004a030be0d81d86e10d61d9a69d24caf23e80e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/004a030be0d81d86e10d61d9a69d24caf23e80e4/0_188_5632_3380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two tourists in Innsbruck\u2019s Hofkirche, with statues surrounding the tomb of Emperor Maximillian\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Innsbruck\u2019s Hofkirche, with statues surrounding the tomb of Emperor Maximilian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From Innsbruck station, <a href=\"https://www.stubai.at/en/skiing-resorts/schlick2000/\" title=\"\">Schlick 2000</a>, above the village of Fulpmes, is just 35 minutes by tram, and Serlesbahnen, one of the new resorts offered on the pass, is a 10-minute hop onwards by bus. With no ski hire shops but a string of mountain restaurants, this resort is used more by winter walkers than skiers so, with the slopes to myself, I was able to carve wide sweeping turns on its steep red runs \u2013 and get back in time for a sauna before dinner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jan/11/cologne-to-vienna-night-train-sleeper-car-austria-state-railway-nightjet\">Dream ticket: the night train from Cologne to Vienna</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The next morning, a bus took us to the Stubai glacier, and we bounced down its 42km of runs in fresh powder. But a storm was building, so Ant headed back to Innsbruck while I took the bus to Elferbahnen ski area near Neustift, another new addition. Its red runs were enticingly steep and the drag lifts even more challenging. For non-skiers, it has some of Austria\u2019s longest sledging runs. </p> <p>I was happy to return to town, though, where we dined in the panoramic Lichtblick restaurant, two minutes from the hotel. Over venison and sole, we looked out across the imperial palace and 15th-century city tower towards Zaha Hadid\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/786967/ad-classics-bergisel-ski-jump-zaha-hadid-architects-innsbruck-austria\" title=\"\">elegant ski jump</a>.</p> <p>Ant set out to visit these cultural highlights the next day; I had planned to explore another resort now on the pass, Bergeralm in Steinach, 20 minutes away. However, as rain began to fall, I worried that Bergeralm was too low, and boarded a bus instead for the hour\u2019s journey to K\u00fchtai, the highest resort in Austria. Being able to pick destinations in response to the weather is another advantage of the pass.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4cac3cf1b69af6519844e2e5e10f7afdea5765be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cac3cf1b69af6519844e2e5e10f7afdea5765be/0_60_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terrace of Caf\u00e9 Lichtblick in winter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caf\u00e9 Lichtblick, in central Innsbruck</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Innsbruck Tourismus / Christian Vorhofer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the landscape got whiter and whiter, I realised that far from seeing too little snow, we were faced with far too much. In the blizzard, cars were stranded by the roadside and, from the top of the chairlift, I was skiing in a whiteout.</p> <p>This is said to be good for perfecting your powder technique as, with no visual clues, you rely on the soles of your feet to tell you how to turn. Apparently. I was just digging myself out of a snowdrift when Ant rang to ask whether Kaiser Maximilian\u2019s magnificent <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-empty-tomb-of-maximilian-i-innsbruck-austria\" title=\"\">mausoleum </a>and the 16th-century <a href=\"https://www.tyrol.com/things-to-do/attractions/all-attractions/a-ambras-castle\" title=\"\">Ambras Castle</a> were on the pass (they are).

      "bodyText": "A skiing holiday with a partner who doesn\u2019t entirely share your passion or aptitude for the sport can be a challenge. But after a morning on easy runs in the Schlick 2000 ski area outside Innsbruck, my husband, Anthony, and I happily headed in different directions: me to the Serlesbahnen cable car for some more demanding powder runs, him into town for lunch and culture. We\u2019d come to Innsbruck because this season the Tirolean capital has launched an updated Ski plus City pass, now covering 13 resorts all between 15 and 75 minutes from the city centre by tram, bus or train. It\u2019s great for skiers looking for variety, as well as for those who want to combine a bit of slope action with a city break: the pass includes entry to 22 museums and attractions. It seems odd to me that the Ski plus City website doesn\u2019t list the train and tram connections, but they can easily be found at the national rail site, oebb.at. Innsbruck can be reached comfortably by train from London, leaving St Pancras around midday, changing at Brussels or Amsterdam, then catching a sleeper in Cologne. A student city with lively bars dotted among elegant 18th-century townhouses, and trams rattling down cobbled streets, Innsbruck makes a fun base. Our hotel, Stage 12, was a modern hideaway in the old quarter, with a welcome sauna and a good cocktail bar. From Innsbruck station, Schlick 2000, above the village of Fulpmes, is just 35 minutes by tram, and Serlesbahnen, one of the new resorts offered on the pass, is a 10-minute hop onwards by bus. With no ski hire shops but a string of mountain restaurants, this resort is used more by winter walkers than skiers so, with the slopes to myself, I was able to carve wide sweeping turns on its steep red runs \u2013 and get back in time for a sauna before dinner. The next morning, a bus took us to the Stubai glacier, and we bounced down its 42km of runs in fresh powder. But a storm was building, so Ant headed back to Innsbruck while I took the bus to Elferbahnen ski area near Neustift, another new addition. Its red runs were enticingly steep and the drag lifts even more challenging. For non-skiers, it has some of Austria\u2019s longest sledging runs. I was happy to return to town, though, where we dined in the panoramic Lichtblick restaurant, two minutes from the hotel. Over venison and sole, we looked out across the imperial palace and 15th-century city tower towards Zaha Hadid\u2019s elegant ski jump. Ant set out to visit these cultural highlights the next day; I had planned to explore another resort now on the pass, Bergeralm in Steinach, 20 minutes away. However, as rain began to fall, I worried that Bergeralm was too low, and boarded a bus instead for the hour\u2019s journey to K\u00fchtai, the highest resort in Austria. Being able to pick destinations in response to the weather is another advantage of the pass. As the landscape got whiter and whiter, I realised that far from seeing too little snow, we were faced with far too much. In the blizzard, cars were stranded by the roadside and, from the top of the chairlift, I was skiing in a whiteout. This is said to be good for perfecting your powder technique as, with no visual clues, you rely on the soles of your feet to tell you how to turn. Apparently. I was just digging myself out of a snowdrift when Ant rang to ask whether Kaiser Maximilian\u2019s magnificent mausoleum and the 16th-century Ambras Castle were on the pass (they are). It felt like he was on a different planet. Still, I had my own taste of Habsburg history when I made it to the piste-side Jagdschloss. Now a hotel and restaurant, this was the Kaiser\u2019s hunting lodge in the 15th century and I walked down its vaulted hallway into one of its wood-panelled salons for a lunch of fresh lake trout, followed by the obligatory Kaiserschmarren pancakes. My plan B had involved going on to Hochoetz, just 13 minutes from K\u00fchtai and only slightly less extensive, with 36km of pistes. But 10cm of snow had fallen over lunchtime, and though the buses had chains on their wheels, I didn\u2019t want to get snowed in, so I headed back towards the safety of Innsbruck. In the lower resorts, Oberperfuss was the only one suffering a lack of snow, but Axamer Lizum was closed by falling trees, and high winds had shut the linked resort of Muttereralm. Glungezer, which has one of the longest slopes in Europe, at 15km, was in the wrong direction for me. Of the two resorts just 15 minutes from the city, Nordkette was closed because of the avalanche risk on its steep slopes but the shuttle between it and Patscherkofel was still operating and I got there shortly before the lifts closed at 4pm. I had hoped to squeeze in two runs, but for that I would have had to repeat Franz Klammer\u2019s legendary descent in the 1976 Olympics. My consolation was another spa session at our hotel, where Ant and I swapped stories of our \u2013 very different \u2013 days\u2019 adventures. \u2022 The trip was provided by the tourist boards of Innsbruck, Stubai and Austria.

      "body": "<p>Live by the greenwash, die by it too. Barely six days after Heathrow Airport declared it had been certified carbon neutral, its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/27/heathrow-third-runway-ruled-illegal-over-climate-change\" title=\"\">third-runway ambitions were trapped in a peat bog</a>. The court of appeal decided that UK aviation policy had not sufficiently made reference to the Paris climate change agreement; and the government declared with a straight face that, committed as it was to a greener future, it would simply have to bow to the judge.</p> <p>However much the law has spoken and campaigners have won a famous victory, it is once again opportunistic politics, above legal judgments and environmental concerns, that will doom the scheme.</p> <p>For Heathrow, it is not so much Groundhog Day as groundhog decade. Almost exactly 10 years ago, in March 2010, a high court judge upheld the claims of anti-third-runway protesters, ruling that the government had failed to scrupulously account for climate change in approving the London airport\u2019s expansion. The verdict required the government to redraw its policy statement; but the Conservative leader, David Cameron, had pinned his colours to the anti-expansion mast. In the wake of the election two months later, he was in Downing Street and it was clear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/24/third-runway-heathrow-scrapped-baa\" title=\"\">the scheme was dead</a>.</p> <p>A strikingly similar scenario appears to have killed off Heathrow\u2019s ambitions again last week. While the airport believes the judgment only presents a small hurdle to clear, it cannot do so if the government declines to jump. For Boris Johnson, in whom those Churchillian qualities of decisive, bold leadership are daily more absent, the ruling is perfect cover. Instead of either embracing or challenging the ruling, the PM left it to his transport secretary to say that the government did not have a dog in this fight, and that Heathrow could appeal if it wanted to.</p> <p>It is, therefore, difficult to prove the claim that this ruling marks a historic watershed whereby governments must rein in policy to the greater demands of the Paris climate accords. The true test case will surely be when a scheme upon which a government is hell-bent is forced through the environmental wringer. Campaigners will hope the Department for Transport proves equally unattached to its prospective multibillion-pound road-building projects, such as the Oxford-to-Cambridge expressway or the Lower Thames Crossing.</p> <p>Much has, of course, changed since 2010: ever more people are aware of the climate emergency, and \u2013 at least outside Trump\u2019s America \u2013 the imperative to act is perceived to be far more urgent. The aviation industry itself has, belatedly, addressed the need to clean up. But whether Johnson, who immediately availed himself of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/labour-demands-inquiry-into-boris-johnsons-holiday\" title=\"\">long-haul flight to the Caribbean</a> to enjoy his first weeks as prime minister, is any more dedicated an environmentalist than his husky-hugging forebear remains to be seen.</p> <p>The financial crisis swiftly changed priorities for the government in the years after 2010, with Cameron soon commissioning an inquiry to restore the runway he had ruled out, in the name of economic growth. It remains to be seen whether coronavirus will indeed surpass the banking crisis for wrecking the global economy, or just how much Brexit will affect Britain\u2019s own economic health.

      "bodyText": "Live by the greenwash, die by it too. Barely six days after Heathrow Airport declared it had been certified carbon neutral, its third-runway ambitions were trapped in a peat bog. The court of appeal decided that UK aviation policy had not sufficiently made reference to the Paris climate change agreement; and the government declared with a straight face that, committed as it was to a greener future, it would simply have to bow to the judge. However much the law has spoken and campaigners have won a famous victory, it is once again opportunistic politics, above legal judgments and environmental concerns, that will doom the scheme. For Heathrow, it is not so much Groundhog Day as groundhog decade. Almost exactly 10 years ago, in March 2010, a high court judge upheld the claims of anti-third-runway protesters, ruling that the government had failed to scrupulously account for climate change in approving the London airport\u2019s expansion. The verdict required the government to redraw its policy statement; but the Conservative leader, David Cameron, had pinned his colours to the anti-expansion mast. In the wake of the election two months later, he was in Downing Street and it was clear that the scheme was dead. A strikingly similar scenario appears to have killed off Heathrow\u2019s ambitions again last week. While the airport believes the judgment only presents a small hurdle to clear, it cannot do so if the government declines to jump. For Boris Johnson, in whom those Churchillian qualities of decisive, bold leadership are daily more absent, the ruling is perfect cover. Instead of either embracing or challenging the ruling, the PM left it to his transport secretary to say that the government did not have a dog in this fight, and that Heathrow could appeal if it wanted to. It is, therefore, difficult to prove the claim that this ruling marks a historic watershed whereby governments must rein in policy to the greater demands of the Paris climate accords. The true test case will surely be when a scheme upon which a government is hell-bent is forced through the environmental wringer. Campaigners will hope the Department for Transport proves equally unattached to its prospective multibillion-pound road-building projects, such as the Oxford-to-Cambridge expressway or the Lower Thames Crossing. Much has, of course, changed since 2010: ever more people are aware of the climate emergency, and \u2013 at least outside Trump\u2019s America \u2013 the imperative to act is perceived to be far more urgent. The aviation industry itself has, belatedly, addressed the need to clean up. But whether Johnson, who immediately availed himself of a long-haul flight to the Caribbean to enjoy his first weeks as prime minister, is any more dedicated an environmentalist than his husky-hugging forebear remains to be seen. The financial crisis swiftly changed priorities for the government in the years after 2010, with Cameron soon commissioning an inquiry to restore the runway he had ruled out, in the name of economic growth. It remains to be seen whether coronavirus will indeed surpass the banking crisis for wrecking the global economy, or just how much Brexit will affect Britain\u2019s own economic health. Both, certainly, could cause enough woe to make foreign travel less desirable or affordable \u2013 potentially solving the problem of airport capacity. But should Britain trundle on, post-Brexit, into the bog-standard doldrums, it would be little surprise to see Heathrow\u2019s runway back on the agenda. In the same breath as it vaunted its environmental credentials, the government said airport expansion remained core to economic growth. For all the current talk of \u201clevelling up\u201d the regions, the reasons that the Cameron-appointed Airports Commission decided a bigger Heathrow was a better bet than, say, Birmingham or a fantasy Thames island airport, are unlikely to change. With luck, another two decades of stalling may provide time to develop planes clean enough for Heathrow\u2019s \u2013 and the government\u2019s \u2013 green claims to ring true. An economy confronting a global crisis will need state support The parallels with the 2008 financial crisis have become all too clear: stock markets falling by record amounts in a single day, with the FTSE and Dow Jones indices posting the fastest corrections \u2013 a drop of at least 10% from the previous peak \u2013 since 1933 and the depths of the Great Depression. The coronavirus panic spreading around the planet has triggered an unfurling crisis for the world economy, with the worst-case scenario including world GDP collapsing into recession for the first time since the banks went bust. The question, for now, is how central banks and governments can stem the bleeding. There is little comfort to be had from the former.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/18/hilary-mantel-reith-lectures-chuck-berry-interviews-san-quentin\" title=\"\">Hilary Mantel gave her BBC Reith lectures in 2017</a> on the subject of historical fiction, she was asked by one audience member if she was really writing ghost stories. She replied emphatically: \u201cYes,\u201d almost before he had finished the question. Ghosts have peopled her fiction from her first novel, <em>Every Day Is Mother\u2019s Day</em>, and her memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview18\" title=\"\"><em>Giving Up the Ghost</em></a>, made clear how permeable the boundary between the living and the dead can seem.</p> <p>\u201cSt Augustine says the dead are invisible, they are not absent.\u201d Mantel opened her first lecture with this quotation, and her historical novels are such towering achievements partly because she appears to inhabit the thoughts and sensory experience of her characters so fully \u2013 not so much as if she is channelling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/03/thomas-cromwell-untold-story-tracy-borman-review\" title=\"\">Thomas Cromwell</a>, but as if she, disembodied, has projected herself back into his mind and drawn the reader with her; as if we are, in effect, ghosts at his shoulder, seeing through his eyes. This effect is particularly noticeable in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/22/the-mirror-and-the-light-hilary-mantel-extract\" title=\"\"><em>The Mirror and the Light</em></a>, the long-awaited third instalment of her trilogy about the blacksmith\u2019s son from Putney who became Henry VIII\u2019s right-hand man and the architect of much Tudor policy that reverberates down to the present.</p> <p>It\u2019s been eight years since the publication of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/04/bring-up-the-bodies-hilary-mantel-review\" title=\"\"><em>Bring Up the Bodies</em></a>, for which Mantel won a second Booker prize, but we find Cromwell exactly where we left him, in May 1536, at the moment the French executioner has struck off Anne Boleyn\u2019s head with his sword. Cromwell is much taken with this sword: Toledo steel, incised with the words of a prayer. It is only later in the book that we learn the words on the blade: <em>Speculum justiciae, ora pro nobis</em>. Mirror of justice, pray for us. It\u2019s one of many references to both mirrors and light stitched subtly throughout the book, though the title comes directly from a line Cromwell offers Henry:</p> <blockquote> \u201cYour Majesty is the only prince. The mirror and the light of other kings.\u201d <br>Henry repeats the phrase, as if cherishing it: the mirror and the light. </blockquote> <p>The question of whether Anne and the men executed for adultery with her received justice is one that haunts many of the characters in the novel, not least the king and Cromwell himself.</p> <blockquote> Henry says: \u201cDid I do right?\u201d <br>Right? The magnitude of the question checks him, like a hand on his arm. </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"886374116783a022fe7ccad872a6d136683b09a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/886374116783a022fe7ccad872a6d136683b09a7/0_0_4284_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Programme Name: Wolf Hall - TX: n/a - Episode: Ep1 (No. 1) - Picture Shows: Thomas Cromwell (MARK RYLANCE) - (C) Company Productions Ltd - Photographer: Giles Keyte 4069738\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We walk with him towards an outcome that we know but he does not\u2019 \u2026 Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell in the BBC adaptation of Wolf Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Keyte/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the dead are not absent. In the Tower of London, Cromwell sees shades of the men whose deaths he contrived, and feels their company when he steps into his barge; at night, he hears footsteps in his bedroom and dreams of Anne\u2019s execution as if it\u2019s part of a series of altar paintings. The answer he gives Henry \u2013 \u201cGo forward, sir. It\u2019s the one direction God permits\u201d \u2013 might be taken as his personal credo, but Cromwell\u2019s path forward takes him along a knife\u2019s edge. Anne\u2019s death has not made his own position more secure \u2013 if anything, the reverse, as the imperial ambassador Chapuys gleefully reminds him: \u201cFor when all is said, you are a blacksmith\u2019s son. Your whole life depends on the next beat of Henry\u2019s heart, and your future on his smile or frown.\u201d</p> <p>The reference harks back to the vivid scene in <em>Bring Up the Bodies</em> when Henry is injured in a tournament and believed dead. Cromwell\u2019s instinct is to flee, but in the event he is the only one who dares lay hands on the king and thump him back to life (his French servant Christophe claims he grabbed the king and bellowed into his face: \u201cBreathe, you fucker, breathe!\u201d). But Chapuys\u2019s words also offer a grim dramatic irony, one instance of many throughout the novel.</p> <p>Because we all know how the story ends. And this is where Mantel\u2019s supreme artistry is most evident: she creates suspense and apprehension where none should exist. \u201cYou succeed not despite the fact that your reader knows what happens, but because of it,\u201d she has said. The present-tense, Cromwell\u2019s-eye narrative means we walk with him towards an outcome that we know but he does not, so that we are both with him and at a distance, helpless to warn him. When, dividing up the spoils of the dissolution, he picks out the monastery of Launde as a modest, pleasant place he might claim for his own retirement, we remember Francis Bryan\u2019s prediction: \u201cIf the king turns on you, it will not be like when old Henry Guildford quit and went off to the country to prune his fruit trees and enjoy the birdsong. Remember how Wolsey fell.\u201d</p> <p>One reviewer complained of <em>Wolf Hall</em> that it had no plot, which strikes me as a wilfully obtuse failure of reading. These books are precision-engineered, and none more so than <em>The Mirror and the Light</em>. It may be less obviously dramatically focused than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/13/bring-up-bodies-hilary-mantel-review\" title=\"\"><em>Bring Up the Bodies</em></a>, which spanned less than a year and concentrated almost exclusively on events leading up to Anne\u2019s death, but the plot here is shaped as meticulously as any thriller. Chekhov\u2019s gun is there on every page: words spoken carelessly or in jest are later repeated in a court of law, their meaning twisted; gifts given in innocence are produced with new motives ascribed. The technical skill required to marshall the events of these four years between 1536 and 1540 \u2013 which include the dissolution of the monasteries, the northern uprising known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, and the political manoeuvring that resulted in Henry\u2019s short-lived fourth marriage to Anna of Cleves \u2013 while rendering those events comprehensible and dramatic to contemporary readers, is breathtaking.</p> <p>It\u2019s impossible not to miss Anne Boleyn; the force of her ambition, and the savage verbal sparring that she enjoyed with Cromwell. Mary, Henry\u2019s daughter by Katherine of Aragon, is a pale substitute, though she, too, attempts to pit her will against Cromwell. Mantel portrays her as a lonely, stubborn young woman, inviting pity but not sympathy, one moment giving in to emotional outbursts, the next desperately trying to assume the lofty dignity of a princess. Her half sister, Anne\u2019s toddler daughter Elizabeth \u2013 now known as My Lady Bastard \u2013 is most often encountered furiously screaming. The only other woman who comes close to Anne\u2019s vitality on the page is her sister-in-law, the waspish and conniving Jane Rochford, who allows Mantel\u2019s foreshadowing to reach even beyond the limit of this book. \u201cHe thinks, you have destroyed one queen, is one enough?\u201d Later, we meet flirty, teenage Katherine Howard, destined to become the second of Henry\u2019s wives to be beheaded, along with Lady Rochford, who arranged her adulterous trysts.</p> <p>Despite the absence of Anne\u2019s glittering wit, the novel is shot through with wry comedy. There is a glorious scene in which the innocent, literal-minded new queen, Jane Seymour, is cornered by her family and Cromwell, all anxious to inquire, delicately, how the wedding night went. Jane earnestly expresses some consternation: \u201cMy difficulty is, he wants me to do some very strange things. Things I never imagined a wife had to do.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There is nothing sentimental in Cromwell\u2019s end, only the most devastating humanity, leaving the reader with stopped breath and a sense of amazement that the real world is continuing outside</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The frantic glances exchanged over her head are so visually perfect \u2013 \u201cEdward looks desperate. Tom begs, \u201cMaster Secretary?\u201d \u2013 that the scene makes you long for the next instalment of the TV adaptation. Edward manages to ask: \u201c\u2026 does it conduce to getting a child?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought so,\u201d Jane says. It is left to Cromwell to coax from the queen what exactly the king asked of her in the bedchamber \u2013 which is, of course, the punchline to the scene.</p> <p>But Jane does not last long, and the quest to find Henry\u2019s next wife provides Cromwell \u2013 promoted first to baron and then to earl \u2013 with an opportunity to continue his project of remaking England. The nation\u2019s founding myths have permeated all three books, and Cromwell is uniquely placed to select how much of that is useful, and how much can be erased, like the entwined initials of Henry and Anne that must now be painted over in every royal palace. But ultimately his fate is to discover that the past \u2013 both his own and his country\u2019s \u2013 insists on reappearing.</p> <p>\u201cCan you make a new England? You can write a new story. You can write new texts and destroy the old ones, set the torn leaves of Duns Scotus sailing about the quadrangles, and place the gospels in every church. You can write on England, but what was written before keeps showing through\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Cromwell\u2019s desire to forge a political alliance with the German Protestant states through a marriage with Anna of Cleves, thereby creating an alternative power bloc in Europe, proves his downfall. Henry takes a dislike to his bride, though Mantel challenges the received idea that it was because Anna was unattractive; in her version, it is the young woman\u2019s unguarded reaction to Henry\u2019s bloated, ageing appearance that wounds the king\u2019s pride and turns him against her. Inevitably, blame falls on Cromwell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/03/thomas-cromwell-untold-story-tracy-borman-review\">Thomas Cromwell review \u2013 new biography of the hero of Wolf Hall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We have always known where it would end. From the first page of <em>Wolf Hall</em>, when we saw through the eyes of 15-year-old Thomas as he lay bleeding on the Putney cobbles, watching his father\u2019s boot as Walter yelled \u201cSo now get up\u201d, we were always going to share that perspective again as his head rested on the executioner\u2019s block. Anyone who has read Mantel\u2019s masterly novel of the French Revolution, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jan/09/review-hilary-mantel-a-place-of-greater-safety\" title=\"\"><em>A Place of Greater Safety</em></a>, will know that she can lead her characters to the scaffold with such fine and telling detail that the reader experiences a visceral reaction to the terror of death. She did it again in <em>Bring Up the Bodies </em>with the execution of Anne Boleyn; the small detail of Anne, blindfold, reaching up to adjust her cap, and Cromwell in the wings, willing her to get her hand out of the way so the headsman can make a clean strike. There is nothing sentimental in Cromwell\u2019s end, only the most devastating humanity, leaving the reader with stopped breath and a sense of amazement, after closing the book, that the real world is continuing outside.</p> <p>It feels redundant to state that <em>The Mirror and the Light </em>is a masterpiece. With this trilogy, Mantel has redefined what the historical novel is capable of; she has given it muscle and sinew, enlarged its scope, and created a prose style that is lyrical and colloquial, at once faithful to its time and entirely recognisable to us. Taken together, her Cromwell novels are, for my money, the greatest English novels of this century.

      "bodyText": "When Hilary Mantel gave her BBC Reith lectures in 2017 on the subject of historical fiction, she was asked by one audience member if she was really writing ghost stories. She replied emphatically: \u201cYes,\u201d almost before he had finished the question. Ghosts have peopled her fiction from her first novel, Every Day Is Mother\u2019s Day, and her memoir, Giving Up the Ghost, made clear how permeable the boundary between the living and the dead can seem. \u201cSt Augustine says the dead are invisible, they are not absent.\u201d Mantel opened her first lecture with this quotation, and her historical novels are such towering achievements partly because she appears to inhabit the thoughts and sensory experience of her characters so fully \u2013 not so much as if she is channelling Thomas Cromwell, but as if she, disembodied, has projected herself back into his mind and drawn the reader with her; as if we are, in effect, ghosts at his shoulder, seeing through his eyes. This effect is particularly noticeable in The Mirror and the Light, the long-awaited third instalment of her trilogy about the blacksmith\u2019s son from Putney who became Henry VIII\u2019s right-hand man and the architect of much Tudor policy that reverberates down to the present. It\u2019s been eight years since the publication of Bring Up the Bodies, for which Mantel won a second Booker prize, but we find Cromwell exactly where we left him, in May 1536, at the moment the French executioner has struck off Anne Boleyn\u2019s head with his sword. Cromwell is much taken with this sword: Toledo steel, incised with the words of a prayer. It is only later in the book that we learn the words on the blade: Speculum justiciae, ora pro nobis. Mirror of justice, pray for us. It\u2019s one of many references to both mirrors and light stitched subtly throughout the book, though the title comes directly from a line Cromwell offers Henry: \u201cYour Majesty is the only prince. The mirror and the light of other kings.\u201d Henry repeats the phrase, as if cherishing it: the mirror and the light. The question of whether Anne and the men executed for adultery with her received justice is one that haunts many of the characters in the novel, not least the king and Cromwell himself. Henry says: \u201cDid I do right?\u201d Right? The magnitude of the question checks him, like a hand on his arm. But the dead are not absent. In the Tower of London, Cromwell sees shades of the men whose deaths he contrived, and feels their company when he steps into his barge; at night, he hears footsteps in his bedroom and dreams of Anne\u2019s execution as if it\u2019s part of a series of altar paintings. The answer he gives Henry \u2013 \u201cGo forward, sir. It\u2019s the one direction God permits\u201d \u2013 might be taken as his personal credo, but Cromwell\u2019s path forward takes him along a knife\u2019s edge. Anne\u2019s death has not made his own position more secure \u2013 if anything, the reverse, as the imperial ambassador Chapuys gleefully reminds him: \u201cFor when all is said, you are a blacksmith\u2019s son. Your whole life depends on the next beat of Henry\u2019s heart, and your future on his smile or frown.\u201d The reference harks back to the vivid scene in Bring Up the Bodies when Henry is injured in a tournament and believed dead. Cromwell\u2019s instinct is to flee, but in the event he is the only one who dares lay hands on the king and thump him back to life (his French servant Christophe claims he grabbed the king and bellowed into his face: \u201cBreathe, you fucker, breathe!\u201d). But Chapuys\u2019s words also offer a grim dramatic irony, one instance of many throughout the novel. Because we all know how the story ends. And this is where Mantel\u2019s supreme artistry is most evident: she creates suspense and apprehension where none should exist. \u201cYou succeed not despite the fact that your reader knows what happens, but because of it,\u201d she has said. The present-tense, Cromwell\u2019s-eye narrative means we walk with him towards an outcome that we know but he does not, so that we are both with him and at a distance, helpless to warn him. When, dividing up the spoils of the dissolution, he picks out the monastery of Launde as a modest, pleasant place he might claim for his own retirement, we remember Francis Bryan\u2019s prediction: \u201cIf the king turns on you, it will not be like when old Henry Guildford quit and went off to the country to prune his fruit trees and enjoy the birdsong. Remember how Wolsey fell.\u201d One reviewer complained of Wolf Hall that it had no plot, which strikes me as a wilfully obtuse failure of reading. These books are precision-engineered, and none more so than The Mirror and the Light. It may be less obviously dramatically focused than Bring Up the Bodies, which spanned less than a year and concentrated almost exclusively on events leading up to Anne\u2019s death, but the plot here is shaped as meticulously as any thriller. Chekhov\u2019s gun is there on every page: words spoken carelessly or in jest are later repeated in a court of law, their meaning twisted; gifts given in innocence are produced with new motives ascribed. The technical skill required to marshall the events of these four years between 1536 and 1540 \u2013 which include the dissolution of the monasteries, the northern uprising known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, and the political manoeuvring that resulted in Henry\u2019s short-lived fourth marriage to Anna of Cleves \u2013 while rendering those events comprehensible and dramatic to contemporary readers, is breathtaking. It\u2019s impossible not to miss Anne Boleyn; the force of her ambition, and the savage verbal sparring that she enjoyed with Cromwell. Mary, Henry\u2019s daughter by Katherine of Aragon, is a pale substitute, though she, too, attempts to pit her will against Cromwell. Mantel portrays her as a lonely, stubborn young woman, inviting pity but not sympathy, one moment giving in to emotional outbursts, the next desperately trying to assume the lofty dignity of a princess. Her half sister, Anne\u2019s toddler daughter Elizabeth \u2013 now known as My Lady Bastard \u2013 is most often encountered furiously screaming. The only other woman who comes close to Anne\u2019s vitality on the page is her sister-in-law, the waspish and conniving Jane Rochford, who allows Mantel\u2019s foreshadowing to reach even beyond the limit of this book. \u201cHe thinks, you have destroyed one queen, is one enough?\u201d Later, we meet flirty, teenage Katherine Howard, destined to become the second of Henry\u2019s wives to be beheaded, along with Lady Rochford, who arranged her adulterous trysts. Despite the absence of Anne\u2019s glittering wit, the novel is shot through with wry comedy. There is a glorious scene in which the innocent, literal-minded new queen, Jane Seymour, is cornered by her family and Cromwell, all anxious to inquire, delicately, how the wedding night went. Jane earnestly expresses some consternation: \u201cMy difficulty is, he wants me to do some very strange things. Things I never imagined a wife had to do.\u201d The frantic glances exchanged over her head are so visually perfect \u2013 \u201cEdward looks desperate. Tom begs, \u201cMaster Secretary?\u201d \u2013 that the scene makes you long for the next instalment of the TV adaptation. Edward manages to ask: \u201c\u2026 does it conduce to getting a child?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought so,\u201d Jane says. It is left to Cromwell to coax from the queen what exactly the king asked of her in the bedchamber \u2013 which is, of course, the punchline to the scene. But Jane does not last long, and the quest to find Henry\u2019s next wife provides Cromwell \u2013 promoted first to baron and then to earl \u2013 with an opportunity to continue his project of remaking England. The nation\u2019s founding myths have permeated all three books, and Cromwell is uniquely placed to select how much of that is useful, and how much can be erased, like the entwined initials of Henry and Anne that must now be painted over in every royal palace. But ultimately his fate is to discover that the past \u2013 both his own and his country\u2019s \u2013 insists on reappearing. \u201cCan you make a new England? You can write a new story. You can write new texts and destroy the old ones, set the torn leaves of Duns Scotus sailing about the quadrangles, and place the gospels in every church. You can write on England, but what was written before keeps showing through\u2026\u201d Cromwell\u2019s desire to forge a political alliance with the German Protestant states through a marriage with Anna of Cleves, thereby creating an alternative power bloc in Europe, proves his downfall. Henry takes a dislike to his bride, though Mantel challenges the received idea that it was because Anna was unattractive; in her version, it is the young woman\u2019s unguarded reaction to Henry\u2019s bloated, ageing appearance that wounds the king\u2019s pride and turns him against her. Inevitably, blame falls on Cromwell. We have always known where it would end. From the first page of Wolf Hall, when we saw through the eyes of 15-year-old Thomas as he lay bleeding on the Putney cobbles, watching his father\u2019s boot as Walter yelled \u201cSo now get up\u201d, we were always going to share that perspective again as his head rested on the executioner\u2019s block. Anyone who has read Mantel\u2019s masterly novel of the French Revolution, A Place of Greater Safety, will know that she can lead her characters to the scaffold with such fine and telling detail that the reader experiences a visceral reaction to the terror of death. She did it again in Bring Up the Bodies with the execution of Anne Boleyn; the small detail of Anne, blindfold, reaching up to adjust her cap, and Cromwell in the wings, willing her to get her hand out of the way so the headsman can make a clean strike. There is nothing sentimental in Cromwell\u2019s end, only the most devastating humanity, leaving the reader with stopped breath and a sense of amazement, after closing the book, that the real world is continuing outside. It feels redundant to state that The Mirror and the Light is a masterpiece. With this trilogy, Mantel has redefined what the historical novel is capable of; she has given it muscle and sinew, enlarged its scope, and created a prose style that is lyrical and colloquial, at once faithful to its time and entirely recognisable to us. Taken together, her Cromwell novels are, for my money, the greatest English novels of this century. Someone give the Booker Prize judges the rest of the year off. \u2022 The Mirror and the Light by Hilary Mantel is published by Fourth Estate (\u00a325). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

There are just two days before Super Tuesday, when 14 states and two other constituencies will go to the polls to award a third of the total number of presidential delegates, which eventually determine that Democratic nominee.</p> \n<p>Biden will be hoping to ride the momentum out of South Carolina to a strong showing next week, where he faces an aggressive Sanders campaign that continues to surge in the critical states of California, Texas and Virginia, and when billionaire and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg will be on the ballot for the first time.</p> \n<p>The win marks the first time that Biden \u2013 who ran unsuccessful campaigns for president in 2008 and 1988 \u2013 has ever claimed victory in a presidential primary.</p> \n<p>Biden, Barack Obama\u2019s former vice-president, used his victory speech to present himself as the Democrats\u2019 most viable chance of defeating Donald Trump in November\u2019s general election.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have the option of winning big or losing big, that\u2019s the choice\u201d he said. \u201cWe need real changes, right now. Something I\u2019ve done my whole career, and I\u2019ll do as president.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a thinly veiled criticism of Sanders, an independent senator who caucuses with the Democrats, he urged voters to elect \u201ca lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sanders came a distant second on Saturday with 20% of the vote, close to the number he scored when he lost resoundingly to Hillary Clinton here in 2016.</p> \n<p>\u201cTonight, we did not win in South Carolina. That will not be the only defeat. A lot of states in this country. Nobody wins them all,\u201d Sanders told a crowd in Virginia, as he pivoted quickly to ballots next week. \u201cNow we enter Super Tuesday.\u201d</p> \n<p>The sheer strength of Biden\u2019s victory here, he scored 49% of the vote with 95% of precincts reporting at 11pm ET, and won most of the state\u2019s 54 delegates, puts significant pressure on other centrist candidates, namely Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, to consider their future in the race. Both scored well below the threshold to secure any delegates from South Carolina, failing to secure major support from African American voters, who comprise 60% of the Democratic electorate in the state. Both have now fallen behind in the overall delegate count.</p> \n<p>Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who is more ideologically aligned with Sanders, also had a poor night, coming in fifth with just 5% of the vote.</p> \n<p>Despite poor showings in both recent debates, Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has indicated they will continue their campaign into Super Tuesday. On Saturday, Bloomberg announced he had bought an unprecedented three minute advertising slot to be broadcast on Sunday on a number of major TV networks.

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden delivered a landslide victory in the South Carolina primary vote on Saturday, breathing new life into his presidential campaign and establishing himself as the main moderate competitor to Bernie Sanders in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cWe are very much alive,\u201d a visibly elated Biden said at a victory rally in Columbia, the state capital. \u201cFor all of you who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind this is your campaign.\u201d \u201cJust days ago, the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead,\u201d he added. The victory, brought by a surge in support among African American voters, comes at a turning point in the campaign. There are just two days before Super Tuesday, when 14 states and two other constituencies will go to the polls to award a third of the total number of presidential delegates, which eventually determine that Democratic nominee. Biden will be hoping to ride the momentum out of South Carolina to a strong showing next week, where he faces an aggressive Sanders campaign that continues to surge in the critical states of California, Texas and Virginia, and when billionaire and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg will be on the ballot for the first time. The win marks the first time that Biden \u2013 who ran unsuccessful campaigns for president in 2008 and 1988 \u2013 has ever claimed victory in a presidential primary. Biden, Barack Obama\u2019s former vice-president, used his victory speech to present himself as the Democrats\u2019 most viable chance of defeating Donald Trump in November\u2019s general election. \u201cWe have the option of winning big or losing big, that\u2019s the choice\u201d he said. \u201cWe need real changes, right now. Something I\u2019ve done my whole career, and I\u2019ll do as president.\u201d In a thinly veiled criticism of Sanders, an independent senator who caucuses with the Democrats, he urged voters to elect \u201ca lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat\u201d. Sanders came a distant second on Saturday with 20% of the vote, close to the number he scored when he lost resoundingly to Hillary Clinton here in 2016. \u201cTonight, we did not win in South Carolina. That will not be the only defeat. A lot of states in this country. Nobody wins them all,\u201d Sanders told a crowd in Virginia, as he pivoted quickly to ballots next week. \u201cNow we enter Super Tuesday.\u201d The sheer strength of Biden\u2019s victory here, he scored 49% of the vote with 95% of precincts reporting at 11pm ET, and won most of the state\u2019s 54 delegates, puts significant pressure on other centrist candidates, namely Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, to consider their future in the race. Both scored well below the threshold to secure any delegates from South Carolina, failing to secure major support from African American voters, who comprise 60% of the Democratic electorate in the state. Both have now fallen behind in the overall delegate count. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who is more ideologically aligned with Sanders, also had a poor night, coming in fifth with just 5% of the vote. Despite poor showings in both recent debates, Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has indicated they will continue their campaign into Super Tuesday. On Saturday, Bloomberg announced he had bought an unprecedented three minute advertising slot to be broadcast on Sunday on a number of major TV networks. He has spent $500m of his personal fortune on the race. As news of Biden\u2019s victory broke almost as soon as polls closed, Trump mocked Bloomberg on Twitter and called for him to leave the race. He said the outcome \u201cshould be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg\u2019s Joke of a campaign. After the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates, Mini Mike now has Biden split up his very few voters, taking many away!\u201d The South Carolina primary did mark the end of the line for the contest\u2019s other billionaire candidate, the former hedge fund manager and climate change activist Tom Steyer. After finishing third in a state where he had invested tens of millions of dollars, Steyer told supporters at a rally in Columbia: \u201cWe were disappointed with where we came out.\u201d He added: \u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t see a path where I can win the presidency.\u201d Steyer failed to win a single delegate in any of the early voting states. Projections indicated Biden won 61% of the black vote, as his popularity was cemented after a key endorsement earlier in the week from the powerful South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn, the most senior African American Democrat in Congress. Clyburn, who had withheld his affirmation following Biden\u2019s poor start to the primary season, introduced the former Delaware senator on Saturday evening. \u201cThis campaign, this year, is about the goodness of America. And we have, as our candidate, a real good man,\u201d Clyburn said, as he played to the major messaging of Biden\u2019s run, which has been to present himself in marked contrast to the shambolic and divisive leadership of Donald Trump. But earlier in the day Clyburn had been frank about Biden\u2019s need to reinvigorate his campaign and address the lack of organization that has characterized his ground game in early states and many of the major Super Tuesday locations. \u201cWe will have to sit down and get serious about how we retool this campaign,\u201d told CNN. He added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit back idly and watch people mishandle this campaign.\u201d Clyburn\u2019s remarks are reflective of the uphill battle Biden still faces to surpass Sanders\u2019 campaign in a race that is about scoring enough delegates, 1,991, to win the nomination. Biden\u2019s win on Saturday takes his tally up to 41, just 12 behind Sanders, according to CNN.

Over the past month, a 2017 book called <em>The Institutional Logic of Governance in China: An Organizational Approach </em>by Zhou Xueguang, a professor at Stanford, has suddenly become popular.</p> <p>In an interview translated into Chinese but later blocked, Zhou blamed country\u2019s top-down decision-making. \u201cThis is not only an outbreak of a novel virus; it\u2019s also a manifestation of the breakdown of China\u2019s governance structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crisis has exposed the cracks in the system.\u201d</p> <p>Aware of these fissures, Zhao Kezhi, the minister of public security, said at a meeting last week that the country must \u201cprioritise the maintenance of political security\u201d during the epidemic and guard against \u201cdisruptive activities carried out by hostile forces at home and abroad\u201d.</p> <p>Officials have launched a \u201cpositive energy\u201d propaganda drive, ranging from pledges from senior leaders, including Xi, to donate personal funds to help fight the virus, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/coronavirus-kills-wuhan-doctor-hundreds-infected-china-prisons\" title=\"\">emotive stories about the sacrifices</a> of frontline medics. The effort has fallen flat. Internet users responded with such scorn to two recent mascots created by the Communist Youth League that the campaign was dropped.</p> <p>\u201cThey feel deeply that this time really could lead to a bigger problem for them,\u201d said Hu Jia, referring to China\u2019s top leaders. \u201cA thousand-mile dyke can collapse because of one ant-hole. They are afraid this will be the crack that causes the whole dam to break.\u201d </p> <p>Activists and critics say the prospect of protests on the street is still remote, but China\u2019s leaders, aware of the dangerous potential, are moving quickly to shut down this wave of public discontent. After a brief window of openness for Chinese media, censors have begun to crack down again. Two other citizen journalists in Wuhan, Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin, have gone missing while legal scholar Xu Zhiyong, who called Xi \u201cclueless\u201d<a href=\"https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/dear-chairman-xi-its-time-you-go\" title=\"\"> in an open letter</a> and asked him to step down, has been detained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/coronavirus-deathsbyage/giv-3902CvN4LGTye0po/\" data-alt=\"Coronavirus\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/coronavirus-deathsbyage/giv-3902CvN4LGTye0po/\">Coronavirus</a> </figure>  <p>But more repression may not work. \u201cPublic anger at the government is much bigger than in any earlier crises, and the anger could grow when the economic fallout of the epidemic fully unfolds,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing for sure is that the social stability contract that has worked for so long \u2013 that the people tolerate the authoritarian rule so far as the government warrants economic prosperity and provides good governance \u2013 is broken in a big way,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Li Zehua, who went to Wuhan in hopes of following in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/coronavirus-journalist-missing-in-wuhan-as-anger-towards-chinese-authorities-grows\" title=\"\">footsteps of disappeared journalist Chen Qiushi</a>, has yet to resurface. Li started a \u201cself media\u201d channel called Disobedience TV in 2018 and is sometimes criticised as naive or emotional. </p> <p>Yet he is also realistic. He says in his last video posting: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about starting some kind of uprising.. That\u2019s not it. I know idealism died that year, that spring\u201d \u2013 an oblique reference to the wave of protests violently put down across China in 1989.</p> <p>Standing outside the door he asks whether the \u201ctwo large guys\u201d on the other side remember studying the Chinese writer Lu Xun in school. Quoting him, Li says: \u201cThere have always been those who fight for the people, who ram through obstacles and pursue truth at all costs \u2026 In these people we discover China\u2019s backbone.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Lillian Yang</em></p>",

More are turning to encrypted platforms such as Telegram and Signal to voice opinions that would probably get their WeChat accounts shut down. A graphic passed around on WeChat included the QR codes for Telegram and Github, used to archive content censored within China, with the words: \u201cWithout free speech there is no point in speaking.\u201d On Douban, a discussion forum, users frustrated with their posts being deleted called for a boycott under the hashtag: \u201cI don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t support\u201d \u2013 a reference to the statement police forced Li Wenliang to sign, promising not to \u201cspread rumours\u201d. \u201cNever before have I seen any other issue awaken ordinary people like this. People now know freedom of speech is the basis of protecting society. We can call this a seed \u2013 a formidable and vital seed,\u201d said Hu Jia, a veteran civil rights activist based in Beijing. Episodes of public outrage are not uncommon in China, but criticism of the political system, which has become even more centralised under Xi Jinping, is normally rare among the public. Over the past month, a 2017 book called The Institutional Logic of Governance in China: An Organizational Approach by Zhou Xueguang, a professor at Stanford, has suddenly become popular. In an interview translated into Chinese but later blocked, Zhou blamed country\u2019s top-down decision-making. \u201cThis is not only an outbreak of a novel virus; it\u2019s also a manifestation of the breakdown of China\u2019s governance structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crisis has exposed the cracks in the system.\u201d Aware of these fissures, Zhao Kezhi, the minister of public security, said at a meeting last week that the country must \u201cprioritise the maintenance of political security\u201d during the epidemic and guard against \u201cdisruptive activities carried out by hostile forces at home and abroad\u201d. Officials have launched a \u201cpositive energy\u201d propaganda drive, ranging from pledges from senior leaders, including Xi, to donate personal funds to help fight the virus, to emotive stories about the sacrifices of frontline medics. The effort has fallen flat. Internet users responded with such scorn to two recent mascots created by the Communist Youth League that the campaign was dropped. \u201cThey feel deeply that this time really could lead to a bigger problem for them,\u201d said Hu Jia, referring to China\u2019s top leaders. \u201cA thousand-mile dyke can collapse because of one ant-hole. They are afraid this will be the crack that causes the whole dam to break.\u201d Activists and critics say the prospect of protests on the street is still remote, but China\u2019s leaders, aware of the dangerous potential, are moving quickly to shut down this wave of public discontent. After a brief window of openness for Chinese media, censors have begun to crack down again. Two other citizen journalists in Wuhan, Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin, have gone missing while legal scholar Xu Zhiyong, who called Xi \u201cclueless\u201d in an open letter and asked him to step down, has been detained. But more repression may not work. \u201cPublic anger at the government is much bigger than in any earlier crises, and the anger could grow when the economic fallout of the epidemic fully unfolds,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cOne thing for sure is that the social stability contract that has worked for so long \u2013 that the people tolerate the authoritarian rule so far as the government warrants economic prosperity and provides good governance \u2013 is broken in a big way,\u201d he said. Li Zehua, who went to Wuhan in hopes of following in the footsteps of disappeared journalist Chen Qiushi, has yet to resurface. Li started a \u201cself media\u201d channel called Disobedience TV in 2018 and is sometimes criticised as naive or emotional. Yet he is also realistic. He says in his last video posting: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about starting some kind of uprising.. That\u2019s not it. I know idealism died that year, that spring\u201d \u2013 an oblique reference to the wave of protests violently put down across China in 1989. Standing outside the door he asks whether the \u201ctwo large guys\u201d on the other side remember studying the Chinese writer Lu Xun in school. Quoting him, Li says: \u201cThere have always been those who fight for the people, who ram through obstacles and pursue truth at all costs \u2026 In these people we discover China\u2019s backbone.\u201d Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",

      "body": "<p><strong>Zorzal Eggo Franco Cabernet Franc, Tupungato, Mendoza, Argentina 2018 (<a href=\"http://www.hnwines.co.uk/\">Hallgarten &amp; Novum Wines</a>)</strong> There\u2019s no doubt that malbec and Mendoza is one of the great modern partnerships of wine region and grape variety. Something in the mix of high-altitude; alluvial clay, sand and rock soils; and a generally dry almost desert-like climate in Andean Argentina \u2013 conditions that are so very different to the grape variety\u2019s homeland in southwest France \u2013 is clearly just right for malbec, and for making wines that mix easeful, juicy fruit, high-toned fragrance and velevety textures. But I do sometimes wonder if the success of malbec has rather obscured Mendoza\u2019s other talents. Those conditions seem to be just as well suited to another red grape variety with southwestern French origins, cabernet franc, with my latest favourite being Zorzal\u2019s version. From vines at 1,350m in the trendy Guatallary zone, and fermented in no-less trendy concrete egg-shaped vessels, it\u2019s gorgeously vivid with crunchy curranty fruit and subtle green leafy-freshness.</p> <p><strong>Co-op Irresistible Bio Bio Valley Malbec, Chile 2017 (\u00a37, <a href=\"https://www.coop.co.uk/\">The Co-op</a>)</strong> If Argentine wine \u2013 or, at least, the Argentine selection available in most wine shops \u2013 can sometimes be accused of being a tad monomaniacal, Chile has sometimes had the opposite problem.

      "bodyText": "Zorzal Eggo Franco Cabernet Franc, Tupungato, Mendoza, Argentina 2018 (Hallgarten &amp; Novum Wines) There\u2019s no doubt that malbec and Mendoza is one of the great modern partnerships of wine region and grape variety. Something in the mix of high-altitude; alluvial clay, sand and rock soils; and a generally dry almost desert-like climate in Andean Argentina \u2013 conditions that are so very different to the grape variety\u2019s homeland in southwest France \u2013 is clearly just right for malbec, and for making wines that mix easeful, juicy fruit, high-toned fragrance and velevety textures. But I do sometimes wonder if the success of malbec has rather obscured Mendoza\u2019s other talents. Those conditions seem to be just as well suited to another red grape variety with southwestern French origins, cabernet franc, with my latest favourite being Zorzal\u2019s version. From vines at 1,350m in the trendy Guatallary zone, and fermented in no-less trendy concrete egg-shaped vessels, it\u2019s gorgeously vivid with crunchy curranty fruit and subtle green leafy-freshness. Co-op Irresistible Bio Bio Valley Malbec, Chile 2017 (\u00a37, The Co-op) If Argentine wine \u2013 or, at least, the Argentine selection available in most wine shops \u2013 can sometimes be accused of being a tad monomaniacal, Chile has sometimes had the opposite problem.

Sure enough, last Friday news broke that the latest patient diagnosed with Covid-19 in England is the first to catch it in the UK. There are now confirmed cases of the virus in more than <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=in+more+than+50+countries+and+it+has+resulted+in+at+least+2%2C800+deaths&amp;oq=in+more+than+50+countries+and+it+has+resulted+in+at+least+2%2C800+deaths&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.307j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\" title=\"\">50 countries</a> and it has resulted in at least 2,800 deaths.</p> <p>With fears that Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-expert-warns-infection-could-reach-60-of-worlds-population\" title=\"\">could infect two-thirds</a> of the world\u2019s population if its spread is not controlled, talk of a pandemic is inevitable. The government\u2019s response here is focused on trying to slow transmission of the virus to lessen its health and economic impacts.</p> <p>Covid-19 is much less deadly than other similar <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/basics/zoonotic-diseases.html\" title=\"\">zoonotic viruses</a> that have transferred from animals to humans; the death rate of Covid-19 is estimated to be 1%-2%, whereas Sars had one of more than 10%. However, the virus appears much more infectious than Sars, and consequently has already resulted in a higher number of deaths worldwide.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>In liberal democracies, governments have to rely far more on changes in individual behaviour to slow the virus\u2019s march</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is where the challenge comes: slowing its spread depends on taking disruptive action, particularly in light of the fact that not all carriers will experience easily identifiable symptoms. After the virus took hold in Hubei province, the Chinese government took drastic measures to try to stop its spread across the rest of China, imposing strict quarantine measures, shutting down whole cities and transport networks. More than <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/21/806958341/restrictions-and-rewards-how-china-is-locking-down-half-a-billion-citizens?t=1582977223872?t=1582977223872&amp;t=1582992646011\" title=\"\">half a billion people</a> have had severe restrictions imposed on their movement; in Hubei province, residents are forbidden from leaving their apartments without prior permission and many community officials are buying and delivering food and medicines for citizens under quarantine. In some areas of China, local government is offering financial rewards for citizens who tell on those who have failed to report their own travel to infected areas, or who turn in those who have a fever.</p> <p>Few countries would impose restrictions this draconian: in liberal democracies governments have to rely far more on changes in individual behaviour to slow the virus\u2019s march. Hence the emphasis in the UK is on self-isolation for those who have travelled to affected areas, and clear public health advice aimed at improving individual hygiene. It is hoped that this will prevent transmission and protect those who are more vulnerable to severe and potentially fatal symptoms.</p> <p>Employer decisions will also be critical. People are more likely to follow official advice to self-isolate at home if they are entitled to sick pay, even if they are showing no symptoms of disease. Last Wednesday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told employers that any staff asked to self-isolate are entitled to take sick leave. However, employment experts have said that employers are not necessarily legally bound by this, so some of this will come down to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/26/coronavirus-uk-will-paid-take-sick-leave\" title=\"\">individual business decisions</a>. With suggestions that schools might need to close for up to two months if the virus infects large numbers of people, the government will also need to issue advice for what employers should do about parents whose children need to remain at home. It may need to make emergency support available to prevent small businesses collapsing. It will certainly need a medium-term plan for responding to the economic consequences of a pandemic; amid concerns about a global recession, global stockmarkets lost \u00a33.9tn in value last week.</p> <p>Health officials have warned that there have been serious issues in the response so far. GPs have reported that public health advice has been unclear: patients who have travelled back from at-risk countries have not been given information about what to do if they develop symptoms on arrival at airports; local health authorities have been refusing to suspend online GP booking services, resulting in patients presenting at surgeries with symptoms and potentially putting other patients at risk; and the NHS\u2019s 111 telephone line has been giving the wrong advice to visit a GP. Meanwhile, two senior NHS leaders have told the <em>Observer</em> that the NHS would struggle to cope with a major outbreak of Covid-19 as a result of a lack of high-dependency beds and specialist respiratory wards. While the long-term health risk of contracting the virus appears to be low, it could have profound knock-on impacts on people\u2019s health as a result of cancelled operations and clinics. School closures could significantly reduce medical staff availability. Any pandemic would inevitably place huge pressures on the health service, but a decade of underfunding has left it vulnerable, understaffed and stretched beyond capacity.</p> <p>More broadly, there has been a complete failure of leadership on the part of the government. At a time when public panic could spread, people need reassurance that there are plans in place to deal with a pandemic. But as the alarming headlines and media reports increase, ministers have delayed appearing on key national news programmes that reach a wide public audience, and it took Boris Johnson days after the first British cases emerged to give a statement to the BBC. It echoes his failure to visit flood-hit areas of the country in recent weeks.</p> <p>The reaction of the government, of individuals and employers will determine how quickly the virus spreads, and therefore its long-term impact on the health and economic wellbeing of the nation. We should also not lose sight of the fact that experts have long warned that a pandemic of this sort would eventually happen without tougher worldwide measures to minimise the risk of zoonotic viruses being transmitted to humans. After this outbreak is over, there needs to be stronger global action to reduce the risk of these outbreaks in the first place.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cA matter of time\u201d was the verdict of England\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, last week on the potential spread of the coronavirus across the UK. Sure enough, last Friday news broke that the latest patient diagnosed with Covid-19 in England is the first to catch it in the UK. There are now confirmed cases of the virus in more than 50 countries and it has resulted in at least 2,800 deaths. With fears that Covid-19 could infect two-thirds of the world\u2019s population if its spread is not controlled, talk of a pandemic is inevitable. The government\u2019s response here is focused on trying to slow transmission of the virus to lessen its health and economic impacts. Covid-19 is much less deadly than other similar zoonotic viruses that have transferred from animals to humans; the death rate of Covid-19 is estimated to be 1%-2%, whereas Sars had one of more than 10%. However, the virus appears much more infectious than Sars, and consequently has already resulted in a higher number of deaths worldwide. This is where the challenge comes: slowing its spread depends on taking disruptive action, particularly in light of the fact that not all carriers will experience easily identifiable symptoms. After the virus took hold in Hubei province, the Chinese government took drastic measures to try to stop its spread across the rest of China, imposing strict quarantine measures, shutting down whole cities and transport networks. More than half a billion people have had severe restrictions imposed on their movement; in Hubei province, residents are forbidden from leaving their apartments without prior permission and many community officials are buying and delivering food and medicines for citizens under quarantine. In some areas of China, local government is offering financial rewards for citizens who tell on those who have failed to report their own travel to infected areas, or who turn in those who have a fever. Few countries would impose restrictions this draconian: in liberal democracies governments have to rely far more on changes in individual behaviour to slow the virus\u2019s march. Hence the emphasis in the UK is on self-isolation for those who have travelled to affected areas, and clear public health advice aimed at improving individual hygiene. It is hoped that this will prevent transmission and protect those who are more vulnerable to severe and potentially fatal symptoms. Employer decisions will also be critical. People are more likely to follow official advice to self-isolate at home if they are entitled to sick pay, even if they are showing no symptoms of disease. Last Wednesday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told employers that any staff asked to self-isolate are entitled to take sick leave. However, employment experts have said that employers are not necessarily legally bound by this, so some of this will come down to individual business decisions. With suggestions that schools might need to close for up to two months if the virus infects large numbers of people, the government will also need to issue advice for what employers should do about parents whose children need to remain at home. It may need to make emergency support available to prevent small businesses collapsing. It will certainly need a medium-term plan for responding to the economic consequences of a pandemic; amid concerns about a global recession, global stockmarkets lost \u00a33.9tn in value last week. Health officials have warned that there have been serious issues in the response so far. GPs have reported that public health advice has been unclear: patients who have travelled back from at-risk countries have not been given information about what to do if they develop symptoms on arrival at airports; local health authorities have been refusing to suspend online GP booking services, resulting in patients presenting at surgeries with symptoms and potentially putting other patients at risk; and the NHS\u2019s 111 telephone line has been giving the wrong advice to visit a GP. Meanwhile, two senior NHS leaders have told the Observer that the NHS would struggle to cope with a major outbreak of Covid-19 as a result of a lack of high-dependency beds and specialist respiratory wards. While the long-term health risk of contracting the virus appears to be low, it could have profound knock-on impacts on people\u2019s health as a result of cancelled operations and clinics. School closures could significantly reduce medical staff availability. Any pandemic would inevitably place huge pressures on the health service, but a decade of underfunding has left it vulnerable, understaffed and stretched beyond capacity. More broadly, there has been a complete failure of leadership on the part of the government. At a time when public panic could spread, people need reassurance that there are plans in place to deal with a pandemic. But as the alarming headlines and media reports increase, ministers have delayed appearing on key national news programmes that reach a wide public audience, and it took Boris Johnson days after the first British cases emerged to give a statement to the BBC. It echoes his failure to visit flood-hit areas of the country in recent weeks. The reaction of the government, of individuals and employers will determine how quickly the virus spreads, and therefore its long-term impact on the health and economic wellbeing of the nation. We should also not lose sight of the fact that experts have long warned that a pandemic of this sort would eventually happen without tougher worldwide measures to minimise the risk of zoonotic viruses being transmitted to humans. After this outbreak is over, there needs to be stronger global action to reduce the risk of these outbreaks in the first place.",

As the US grapples with a lethal virus that is on the brink of becoming a pandemic, an ailing stock market stuck in a steep swoon, a president who has a soft spot for anti-vaxxers and a vice president allergic to science, McFarland\u2019s timing couldn\u2019t be better. Indeed, unlike other White House staffers she possesses actual government experience, having served under Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan \u2013 even if she forgot to vote for Reagan in 1984. As is to be expected, in her book McFarland repeatedly and conveniently bashes liberals and elites, denounces congressional oversight and special prosecutors and pays tribute to Trump and the \u201caverage\u201d American. Omitted is the road traveled to reach this point. In 2006, after Jeanine Pirro backed out of running against Hillary Clinton for the Republican nomination for Senate in New York, McFarland threw her hat in the ring. Her opponent repeatedly tagged her as a \u201cliberal elitist\u201d and she acknowledged being a liberal on social issues, including admitting to being a pro-choice moderate. McFarland also claimed she was being surveilled by the Clinton campaign. As Rupert Murdoch\u2019s New York Post reported it, the candidate told a group of Long Island Republicans: \u201cHillary Clinton is really worried about me and is so worried, in fact, that she had helicopters flying over my house in Southampton today, taking pictures.\u201d McFarland appeared serious and the episode helped sink her candidacy. She lost by more than three-to-two. Fast forward to January 2014, and the long aftermath of the deadly attack on a US facility in Benghazi in September 2012. McFarland told Fox: \u201cThe only way the American people will get to the bottom of this \u2026 is if there is a special prosecutor who has the ability to subpoena witnesses and grant whistleblower protection to them \u2026 otherwise the cover-up will continue.\u201d Bob Mueller, are you listening? McFarland also lacks credibility when it comes to her belated denunciation of the war in Iraq and her rejection of \u201cforever wars\u201d. As a Senate candidate, she refused to criticize the war even as she declined to say if she would have voted for it. Beyond that, according to federal campaign finance records McFarland donated more than $10,000 to the 2008 presidential campaign of John McCain, and helped bundle six figures in campaign donations for the Arizona senator. In life, McCain was an ardent supporter of the Iraq war. Now, he haunts Trump from the grave. McFarland does have her moments. In addition to dumping on those who sought her removal from the West Wing, she describes how Robert Gates, defense secretary under George W Bush and Barack Obama, angled to be Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Writing of a meeting during the transition \u2013 already reported by Peter Bergen of CNN \u2013 McFarland dishes that Gates told Trump that if he wanted the \u201cperson with the most experience\u201d, it would have been Gates. McFarland adds that Gates gave no hint he was joking and offered Exxon\u2019s Rex Tillerson as an \u201coutside the box\u201d choice. Revolution also addresses the challenge that China and Huawei pose to the US, and mentions the administration\u2019s willingness to engage the UK in trade talks after Brexit. Left unsaid and probably unconsidered is the possibility Boris Johnson would embrace Huawei as an insurance policy. There is no indication anyone in Trump\u2019s orbit gave thought to that as they cradled Johnson and Nigel Farage. Think of McFarland\u2019s book as paean to populism written from the Hamptons. She refers to the \u201cwill of the people\u201d but fails to mention that Trump lost the popular vote. There is a legitimacy problem with populism that pays greater heed to the voice of the minority. Likewise, she takes note of \u201cRepublican \u2018birthers\u2019\u201d who slandered Obama with racist attacks, but ignores the fact Trump was the birther-in-chief. Said differently, Revolution is a book written for the president and those who have his ear.",

While the policies espoused by rival candidates matter a great deal, one consideration dominates all others: who among them is best equipped to beat Donald Trump in November?</p> <p>Bernie Sanders, the radical leftwing senator from Vermont, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/485023-sanders-zeroes-in-on-super-tuesday-states\" title=\"\">currently leads </a>the race. Having performed well in Iowa and New Hampshire, and secured a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/22/nevada-caucuses-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-diverse\" title=\"\">big victory in Nevada</a>, Sanders goes into Tuesday\u2019s contests with an average double-digit lead in national polls over his nearest rivals, Joe Biden, a former vice-president, and Mike Bloomberg, a former New York mayor.</p> <p>Sanders has enjoyed notable success in grassroots fundraising and energising the party base, including younger voters and Latinos. He casts himself as an agent of revolutionary change, ready to stand up for working people against vested interests \u2013 for example, by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/4/10/18304448/bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all\" title=\"\">guaranteeing universal health cover</a>. Unusually for modern American politics, he is not afraid to be called a socialist.</p> <p>Although Tuesday\u2019s votes will not end the contest, they could provide Sanders with a clear path to the nomination. This prospect is the cause of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/us/politics/democratic-superdelegates.html\" title=\"\">growing unease</a> among the Democratic party\u2019s centre-right establishment, especially Congress members elected in the 2018 midterm polls, when many swing voters abandoned Trump\u2019s Republicans.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While Sanders may be an idealist, he is also a politician eyeing a last chance at power</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Party critics suggest that Sanders is too old (he will be 79 in September) or that health issues may render him unfit (he suffered a heart attack last year). But their biggest worry concerns electability, given his unapologetically populist platform and his record on divisive issues such as Cuba. Old foes Bill and Hillary Clinton fear Sanders will scare off independents and moderate voters.</p> <p>\u201cLiberalism celebrates certain values: reasonableness, conversation, compassion, tolerance, intellectual humility and optimism,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/opinion/bernie-sanders.html\" title=\"\">wrote</a> the American political columnist David Brooks last week. \u201cSanders\u2019s leadership style embodies populist values, which are different: rage, bitter and relentless polarisation, a demand for ideological purity among your friends, and incessant hatred for your supposed foes.\u201d</p> <p>Some of this angst is overcooked in ways that the Labour party might recognise. Yet Sanders is no Jeremy Corbyn. He has no use for glorious defeat. If nominated, he will doubtless proclaim his principles. In practice, he may tack towards the centre, as he has already on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/25/21143931/bernie-sanders-immigration-record-explained\" title=\"\">immigration</a>. That would not please his fans. But while Sanders may be an idealist, he is also a politician eyeing a last chance at power.</p> <p>Would his candidacy be a gift to Trump? The president, and his GOP supporters and Russian friends, believe so; they are betting on Bernie. Yet the political scientist Steve Phillips suggests <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/opinion/bernie-sanders-polls.html\" title=\"\">such predictions are wide of the mark</a>. In 72 head-to-head polls conducted in the past year, he noted, Sanders beat Trump in all but five.</p> <p>Phillips argues that demographic changes in battleground states such as Michigan and Wisconsin favour Sanders. Both were won narrowly by Trump in 2016. Since then, nearly 1 million young people there have turned 18 \u2013 and they, mostly, will vote Democrat. If such trends are projected nationally, Sanders <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/opinion/bernie-sanders-polls.html\" title=\"\">could win the popular vote</a> and the electoral college. His hopes rest on the record turnout he claims he can attract. Meanwhile, rivals snap at his heels. Big spending by Bloomberg has bought him a slice of the polling action. Biden remains a threat, and two other middling candidates, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\" title=\"\">Pete Buttigieg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amy-klobuchar\" title=\"\">Amy Klobuchar</a>, could amass enough delegates to turn the party convention in Milwaukee in July into a cliffhanger. Leftwinger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Warren</a> is a wild card.</p> <p>Whoever eventually gets the nod, it\u2019s clear the party must quickly come together around their banner \u2013 and attack the real target. Dislodging Trump will be fiendishly difficult. In this looming showdown, unity is all.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The battle for the US Democratic party\u2019s presidential nomination will reach a sort of climax this week when 14 states, including California and Texas, hold Super Tuesday primary contests. While the policies espoused by rival candidates matter a great deal, one consideration dominates all others: who among them is best equipped to beat Donald Trump in November? Bernie Sanders, the radical leftwing senator from Vermont, currently leads the race. Having performed well in Iowa and New Hampshire, and secured a big victory in Nevada, Sanders goes into Tuesday\u2019s contests with an average double-digit lead in national polls over his nearest rivals, Joe Biden, a former vice-president, and Mike Bloomberg, a former New York mayor. Sanders has enjoyed notable success in grassroots fundraising and energising the party base, including younger voters and Latinos. He casts himself as an agent of revolutionary change, ready to stand up for working people against vested interests \u2013 for example, by guaranteeing universal health cover. Unusually for modern American politics, he is not afraid to be called a socialist. Although Tuesday\u2019s votes will not end the contest, they could provide Sanders with a clear path to the nomination. This prospect is the cause of growing unease among the Democratic party\u2019s centre-right establishment, especially Congress members elected in the 2018 midterm polls, when many swing voters abandoned Trump\u2019s Republicans. Party critics suggest that Sanders is too old (he will be 79 in September) or that health issues may render him unfit (he suffered a heart attack last year). But their biggest worry concerns electability, given his unapologetically populist platform and his record on divisive issues such as Cuba. Old foes Bill and Hillary Clinton fear Sanders will scare off independents and moderate voters. \u201cLiberalism celebrates certain values: reasonableness, conversation, compassion, tolerance, intellectual humility and optimism,\u201d wrote the American political columnist David Brooks last week. \u201cSanders\u2019s leadership style embodies populist values, which are different: rage, bitter and relentless polarisation, a demand for ideological purity among your friends, and incessant hatred for your supposed foes.\u201d Some of this angst is overcooked in ways that the Labour party might recognise. Yet Sanders is no Jeremy Corbyn. He has no use for glorious defeat. If nominated, he will doubtless proclaim his principles. In practice, he may tack towards the centre, as he has already on immigration. That would not please his fans. But while Sanders may be an idealist, he is also a politician eyeing a last chance at power. Would his candidacy be a gift to Trump? The president, and his GOP supporters and Russian friends, believe so; they are betting on Bernie. Yet the political scientist Steve Phillips suggests such predictions are wide of the mark. In 72 head-to-head polls conducted in the past year, he noted, Sanders beat Trump in all but five. Phillips argues that demographic changes in battleground states such as Michigan and Wisconsin favour Sanders. Both were won narrowly by Trump in 2016. Since then, nearly 1 million young people there have turned 18 \u2013 and they, mostly, will vote Democrat. If such trends are projected nationally, Sanders could win the popular vote and the electoral college. His hopes rest on the record turnout he claims he can attract. Meanwhile, rivals snap at his heels. Big spending by Bloomberg has bought him a slice of the polling action. Biden remains a threat, and two other middling candidates, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, could amass enough delegates to turn the party convention in Milwaukee in July into a cliffhanger. Leftwinger Elizabeth Warren is a wild card. Whoever eventually gets the nod, it\u2019s clear the party must quickly come together around their banner \u2013 and attack the real target. Dislodging Trump will be fiendishly difficult. In this looming showdown, unity is all.",

It literally comes with the territory, that territory being a corner in London\u2019s Mayfair.

There, dinner still costs \u00a398. Perhaps restaurants should introduce theatre-style pricing: the lousier your seat the less you pay.</p> <p>To be fair, the receptionist did look anxious when she clocked the table and offered to put us in the bar until something better became available. I declined. Although I book under a pseudonym, I\u2019m obviously not anonymous once I arrive. But I can pretend to be anonymous, by just taking what I\u2019m given. What will Davies and Brook feel like from up here on the mezzanine looking down on the beautiful people? At one point my companion tries to pull more of the tiny table her way. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to steal the duvet,\u201d I say. Our waiter laughs and says, \u201cI like your sense of humour,\u201d in a serious way, like Rutger Hauer in <em>Blade Runner</em>, just after the whole speech about having witnessed attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e60491b046d1c2f8793e08814bf8bbc4f15d1d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e60491b046d1c2f8793e08814bf8bbc4f15d1d3/167_389_4724_2834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Everything is coffee-table photography book pretty\u2019: seabass ceviche.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Everything is coffee-table photography book pretty\u2019: seabass ceviche.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Davies and Brook forces such epic comparisons. It belongs to Daniel Humm, chef of the three Michelin star <a href=\"https://www.elevenmadisonpark.com/\" title=\"\">Eleven Madison Park</a> in New York. I ate there more than a decade ago, when it was an urban bistro serving robust, punchy food. They were famed for bringing a whole roast duck to your table prior to carving, lavender poking out of its arse. But over the years Humm has refined his cooking. Now it catches the eye of those who hand out the stars and of grand hotels looking for a USP.</p> <p>Until 2018 this dining room was home to Fera, the London outpost of chef Simon Rogan of <a href=\"https://www.lenclume.co.uk/\" title=\"\">L\u2019Enclume</a> where the cooking is an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/23/jay-rayner-restaurant-enclume-cumbria\" title=\"\">expression of the Cumbrian landscape</a>. The experience, while accomplished, felt disjointed here in Mayfair, where crags are in short supply. Before that, from 2001, it was Gordon Ramsay\u2019s first hotel dining room, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/nov/11/foodanddrink.restaurants1\" title=\"\">a place of high-gloss classicism</a>. I reviewed both, so here I am for the third take. The room has been pared down to cool downlit greys, with artfully arranged vases of calla lilies. The ceiling is decorated with long overlaid oval recesses that a lazier critic might compare to female genitalia and in turn use as an excuse for jokes about being screwed, but I\u2019m better than that.</p> <p>It is all extremely poised, as is the cooking, which has a pronounced Asian accent. The first taster dish, presented in an antique wooden box to emphasise the profound value of the moment, is a saucer of congee, a savoury rice porridge, in a mushroom and ginger broth, overlaid with enoki mushrooms. Mushrooms play a big part in all this. Fabulous, golden-glazed brioche-like bread rolls come with mushroom glazed butter. There\u2019s a second taster of an enoki mushroom salad, laid out in a fan. Among the warm starters, at a \u00a310 supplement, is a king crab chawanmushi, a warm Japanese-style savoury custard over which has been laid strips of crab, black truffle and daikon radish, in a mildly glutinous sauce. Like the congee, it\u2019s clever, if texturally challenging.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4436854039f395df3ebccea094d55790d1b17fa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4436854039f395df3ebccea094d55790d1b17fa8/336_246_4805_2883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018What Nobu\u2019s black cod would be if it learned some manners\u2019: black cod and cabbage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What Nobu\u2019s black cod would be if it learned some manners\u2019: black cod and cabbage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everything is coffee-table photography book pretty.

      "bodyText": "Davies and Brook, Claridge\u2019s, Brook Street, London W1K 4HR (020 7107 8848). Four course \u00e0 la carte: \u00a398, wines from \u00a338 Complaining about the prices being too high at Claridge\u2019s is like moaning about the Pope being too religious or Rory Stewart being too annoying. It literally comes with the territory, that territory being a corner in London\u2019s Mayfair. So let\u2019s acknowledge that four courses at Davies and Brook, named after the two streets upon which it sits, costs \u00a398 and move on. It\u2019s what happens when one of London\u2019s grandest hotels imports one of New York\u2019s most garlanded chefs. You are, however, entitled to raise an eyebrow when, having booked two months in advance, you are shown to the worst table in the room, a thin tableclothed strip against a narrow sofa upon which you and your companion must sit, side by side. There, dinner still costs \u00a398. Perhaps restaurants should introduce theatre-style pricing: the lousier your seat the less you pay. To be fair, the receptionist did look anxious when she clocked the table and offered to put us in the bar until something better became available. I declined. Although I book under a pseudonym, I\u2019m obviously not anonymous once I arrive. But I can pretend to be anonymous, by just taking what I\u2019m given. What will Davies and Brook feel like from up here on the mezzanine looking down on the beautiful people? At one point my companion tries to pull more of the tiny table her way. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to steal the duvet,\u201d I say. Our waiter laughs and says, \u201cI like your sense of humour,\u201d in a serious way, like Rutger Hauer in Blade Runner, just after the whole speech about having witnessed attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. Davies and Brook forces such epic comparisons. It belongs to Daniel Humm, chef of the three Michelin star Eleven Madison Park in New York. I ate there more than a decade ago, when it was an urban bistro serving robust, punchy food. They were famed for bringing a whole roast duck to your table prior to carving, lavender poking out of its arse. But over the years Humm has refined his cooking. Now it catches the eye of those who hand out the stars and of grand hotels looking for a USP. Until 2018 this dining room was home to Fera, the London outpost of chef Simon Rogan of L\u2019Enclume where the cooking is an expression of the Cumbrian landscape. The experience, while accomplished, felt disjointed here in Mayfair, where crags are in short supply. Before that, from 2001, it was Gordon Ramsay\u2019s first hotel dining room, a place of high-gloss classicism. I reviewed both, so here I am for the third take. The room has been pared down to cool downlit greys, with artfully arranged vases of calla lilies. The ceiling is decorated with long overlaid oval recesses that a lazier critic might compare to female genitalia and in turn use as an excuse for jokes about being screwed, but I\u2019m better than that. It is all extremely poised, as is the cooking, which has a pronounced Asian accent. The first taster dish, presented in an antique wooden box to emphasise the profound value of the moment, is a saucer of congee, a savoury rice porridge, in a mushroom and ginger broth, overlaid with enoki mushrooms.

Ten minutes to midnight\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s a real treat in that nice 15-minute post-<em>World at One</em> slot on Radio 4. <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000fp5h/episodes/downloads\" title=\"\">The Californian Century</a></strong>, with a daily episode last week and this, is a truly wonderful listen. Actor Stanley Tucci, styled as \u201cthe Writer\u201d, taps on an imaginary typewriter and reads out his pretend film scripts, telling intriguing stories from LA, San Fran and the California countryside. We meet the female preacher, once one of the most famous people alive, who disappeared without trace\u2026 and then came back. We hear about the first African American winner of an Oscar; the Jewish guy who recruited people to infiltrate pro-Nazi organisations in the 1920s and 30s; the man who brought water to the desert. Every story is so interesting. Like a feature film in every episode. Which is the point, of course.</p> <p>Writer-producer Laurence Grissell is clearly someone who cares. His excellent script is detailed but also confiding, with contemporary interviews cleverly woven in (\u201cExterior, present day. A woman sits on a bench\u2026 \u201d) And Tucci has clearly been encouraged to work hard at his presentation; to act, properly, instead of going for ye olde here\u2019s-a-celebrity-let\u2019s-get-them-to-read-out-dull-inserts-in-a-monotone approach. He plays the hard-boiled scriptwriter to perfection, with a California accent and wonderful pacing, packing in a fantastic amount of information without ever seeming hurried. The accompanying music is carefully chosen to remind us of whichever era we visit. And the tracks that play out each episode are exemplary: Marlena Shaw\u2019s California Soul, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/nov/16/dead-kennedys-10-of-the-best\" title=\"\">Dead Kennedys\u2019 California \u00dcber Alles</a>\u2026</p> <p>The series takes in Hollywood (obviously), but also, this week, Silicon Valley, the Black Panthers and Ice-T. You could listen to each episode as it comes, or wait until the end to binge it. I might do both.</p> <p>Another show that always packs in the detail and tells a fine tale is <strong><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/thetipoff\" title=\"\">The Tip Off</a></strong>, a podcast about investigative reporting. Back for its fifth series, and bringing out episodes fortnightly, its opener, <em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/thetipoff/65b04f46-777f-4775-b887-492a2ef54ac3\" title=\"\">Holding Hands to Jump</a></em>, which came out on 13 February, went through the <em>New York Times </em>2017 expos\u00e9 of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s revolting sexual bullying and his company\u2019s non-disclosure agreements and payoffs of several accusing women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5bde3b34b1b78ffd31357bee6b7b4601def5170\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5bde3b34b1b78ffd31357bee6b7b4601def5170/524_0_1955_1955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, who feature in a new episode of The Tip Off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noam Galai/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have heard this story \u2013 of the two female reporters, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey \u2013 several times before, including on the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s<em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2019/oct/29/the-women-who-broke-the-harvey-weinstein-story-podcast\" title=\"\">Today in Focus</a> </em>podcast: it\u2019s still worth the retell. In the light of the trial verdict last week, it\u2019s interesting to hear about how hard the reporters had to work to get the women Weinstein abused to tell their stories. Last week\u2019s episode, <em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/thetipoff/76363ae1-9ac5-4dec-a988-6b295852326c\" title=\"\">Fragments</a></em>, is about a 2018 bomb strike in Afghanistan that <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2019-06-03/us-bomb-kills-afghan-family\" title=\"\">killed a man\u2019s entire family</a>: his wife, 32, their seven children, aged between 4 and 14, and the children\u2019s four cousins, aged 10 to 16. Masih, the father, was away, working in Iran, when the bomb fell. The episode features him, British journalist Jessica Purkis and JD, an Afhgan journalist on the ground. Their painstaking work unpicks the truth, though there are many powerful people who refuse to accept responsibility. A mystery solved, though it doesn\u2019t solve anything, really.</p> <p>Finally, <strong><a href=\"https://planetradio.co.uk/absolute-radio-20s/player/\" title=\"\">Absolute Radio</a></strong><a href=\"https://planetradio.co.uk/absolute-radio-20s/player/\" title=\"\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://planetradio.co.uk/absolute-radio-20s/player/\" title=\"\">20s</a></strong>, which launched on Monday, joining Absolute\u2019s suite of other decade-hooked stations: 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s and 10s. But we\u2019re only two months into 2020! I hear you cry. But what that means is that Absolute 20s plays new music by Billie Eilish, the Strokes, Michael Kiwanuka, Badly Drawn Boy\u2026 Nothing to scare the cat, but an easy way to hear all-new tracks on commercial radio (which does have a tendency to look back).

Lit by the moon, a young man dismounts and, with his back to camera, lights a cigarette, gazing at the dam. He exhales a stream of smoke. Cut to: bedroom of two small children, sleeping. The boy clutches a teddy, the girl has her thumb in her mouth. Close on: bedside clock. Ten minutes to midnight\u2026\u201d Here\u2019s a real treat in that nice 15-minute post-World at One slot on Radio 4. The Californian Century, with a daily episode last week and this, is a truly wonderful listen. Actor Stanley Tucci, styled as \u201cthe Writer\u201d, taps on an imaginary typewriter and reads out his pretend film scripts, telling intriguing stories from LA, San Fran and the California countryside. We meet the female preacher, once one of the most famous people alive, who disappeared without trace\u2026 and then came back. We hear about the first African American winner of an Oscar; the Jewish guy who recruited people to infiltrate pro-Nazi organisations in the 1920s and 30s; the man who brought water to the desert. Every story is so interesting. Like a feature film in every episode. Which is the point, of course. Writer-producer Laurence Grissell is clearly someone who cares. His excellent script is detailed but also confiding, with contemporary interviews cleverly woven in (\u201cExterior, present day. A woman sits on a bench\u2026 \u201d) And Tucci has clearly been encouraged to work hard at his presentation; to act, properly, instead of going for ye olde here\u2019s-a-celebrity-let\u2019s-get-them-to-read-out-dull-inserts-in-a-monotone approach. He plays the hard-boiled scriptwriter to perfection, with a California accent and wonderful pacing, packing in a fantastic amount of information without ever seeming hurried. The accompanying music is carefully chosen to remind us of whichever era we visit. And the tracks that play out each episode are exemplary: Marlena Shaw\u2019s California Soul, the Dead Kennedys\u2019 California \u00dcber Alles\u2026 The series takes in Hollywood (obviously), but also, this week, Silicon Valley, the Black Panthers and Ice-T. You could listen to each episode as it comes, or wait until the end to binge it. I might do both. Another show that always packs in the detail and tells a fine tale is The Tip Off, a podcast about investigative reporting. Back for its fifth series, and bringing out episodes fortnightly, its opener, Holding Hands to Jump, which came out on 13 February, went through the New York Times 2017 expos\u00e9 of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s revolting sexual bullying and his company\u2019s non-disclosure agreements and payoffs of several accusing women. I have heard this story \u2013 of the two female reporters, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey \u2013 several times before, including on the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast: it\u2019s still worth the retell. In the light of the trial verdict last week, it\u2019s interesting to hear about how hard the reporters had to work to get the women Weinstein abused to tell their stories. Last week\u2019s episode, Fragments, is about a 2018 bomb strike in Afghanistan that killed a man\u2019s entire family: his wife, 32, their seven children, aged between 4 and 14, and the children\u2019s four cousins, aged 10 to 16. Masih, the father, was away, working in Iran, when the bomb fell. The episode features him, British journalist Jessica Purkis and JD, an Afhgan journalist on the ground. Their painstaking work unpicks the truth, though there are many powerful people who refuse to accept responsibility. A mystery solved, though it doesn\u2019t solve anything, really. Finally, Absolute Radio 20s, which launched on Monday, joining Absolute\u2019s suite of other decade-hooked stations: 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s and 10s. But we\u2019re only two months into 2020! I hear you cry. But what that means is that Absolute 20s plays new music by Billie Eilish, the Strokes, Michael Kiwanuka, Badly Drawn Boy\u2026 Nothing to scare the cat, but an easy way to hear all-new tracks on commercial radio (which does have a tendency to look back). I applaud the chutzpah. Pod doctor: Send me your podcast questions... Hello, people. If you\u2019ve read this far, then we know you like to listen to brilliant audio and we also know there are ridiculous amounts of podcasts out there to sift through. Well, I\u2019m here to help. In April, for one week only, I am taking on the role of the Pod Doctor: half agony aunt, half headphone guru. If you write in with a problem, or a request, or an I\u2019m-sure-this-exists-but-I-don\u2019t-know-how-to-find-it query, then I\u2019m happy to prescribe some suitable podcast listening, just for you. Perhaps you enjoy Radio 4, but are yet to venture into Podcast World. Perhaps you love Adam Buxton and wonder if there are any other interview series that will give you as many laffs and insight. Perhaps you love a mystery, but you\u2019re a bit sick of true crime series that lip-smack over dead women. Whatever your audio needs, the Pod Doctor is here to help! Send me, Miranda Sawyer, your questions: review@observer.co.uk or tweet @ObsNewReview",

      "body": "<h2>Art Cullen: \u2018The race is down to Sanders v Biden\u2019</h2> <p>Joe Biden did much to consolidate the moderate wing of the Democratic presidential electorate with a blowout win Saturday in South Carolina. He exceeded expectations as African-American voters flocked to him. But Biden continues to face a daunting path forward if Bernie Sanders wins California as big as polls suggest on Super Tuesday, and if Michael Bloomberg does not go away.</p> <p>Bloomberg should take a hint from Tom Steyer\u2019s result: after spending $20m in South Carolina and camping there, Steyer couldn\u2019t even muster 15% viability to capture delegates. Billionaires are not welcome.</p> <p>Amy Klobuchar ran a good race but her moment passed. Pete Buttigieg clearly has not fared well with minority voters crucial to a winning effort. Elizabeth Warren is running out of options.</p> <p>Biden and Sanders have demonstrated that they can build diverse coalitions critical to success in November. Yet, Sanders has to ask himself some hard questions about why he under-performs with African-American voters, and needs to reach out more to unify the party. Sanders remains the front-runner and the probable nominee if he dominates in California, turns out Latinos in Texas and runs even in the other Super Tuesday states. Bloomberg may assure that with hundreds of millions spent in vain.</p> <ul> <li><p>Art Cullen is editor of The Storm Lake Times in Northwest Iowa, where he won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing. He is a Guardian US columnist and author of the book Storm Lake: Change, Resilience, and Hope in America\u2019s Heartland</p></li> </ul> <h2>Lloyd Green: Joe Biden is back \u2013 but this triumph won\u2019t last long</h2> <p>Joe Biden is back with a commanding win in South Carolina after defeats in three-straight contests. But now comes Super Tuesday.</p> <p>According to polls, Bernie Sanders holds comfortable leads in delegate rich <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/ca/california_democratic_primary-6879.html\">California</a> and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/tx/texas_democratic_primary-6875.html\">Texas</a>, where early voting is underway. Practically speaking, the former vice president will have little time to enjoy his triumph.</p> <p>As for Saturday\u2019s losers, South Carolina flashed a red light at Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren. Each ran in the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/exit-polls-2020-south-carolina-primary/\">low single-digits</a> with black voters. By contrast, Biden beat Sanders with this key demographic by three-to-one. Historically, the Democratic nominee is the candidate who has fared best among the Democrats\u2019 most reliable voting bloc.</p> <p>It was also a bad day for Mike Bloomberg who wasn\u2019t on the ballot. Biden\u2019s convincing win undercut the rationale for the ex-New York City mayor\u2019s candidacy. Biden has proved to be more durable than estimated, and little more than a quarter of South Carolina\u2019s black primary voters view Bloomberg favorably.</p> <p>In all but 1988 and 2004, the winner of the South Carolina primary emerged as the Democratic standard-bearer. In South Carolina, Biden was outspent 40-one. From looks of things, it is now a two-person race: Bernie v Biden.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lloyd Green was opposition research counsel to George HW Bush\u2019s 1988 campaign and served in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992</p></li> </ul> <h2>Benjamin Dixon: \u2018The Democrats remain deeply divided\u2019</h2> <p>The Democratic party is at an impasse that can best be observed by Joe Biden\u2019s overwhelming win in South Carolina. I had the chance to spend the weekend in Columbia, South Carolina. What I found more than anything else was fear of a progressive agenda. Just the mention of the name, \u201cBernie Sanders\u201d turned several voters I spoke with from gentle, almost passive, observers of the election into fierce and staunch opponents to the progressive from Vermont.</p> <p>While I wanted to dismiss my observations as merely being anecdotal, my gut told me otherwise.

      "bodyText": "Art Cullen: \u2018The race is down to Sanders v Biden\u2019 Joe Biden did much to consolidate the moderate wing of the Democratic presidential electorate with a blowout win Saturday in South Carolina. He exceeded expectations as African-American voters flocked to him. But Biden continues to face a daunting path forward if Bernie Sanders wins California as big as polls suggest on Super Tuesday, and if Michael Bloomberg does not go away. Bloomberg should take a hint from Tom Steyer\u2019s result: after spending $20m in South Carolina and camping there, Steyer couldn\u2019t even muster 15% viability to capture delegates. Billionaires are not welcome. Amy Klobuchar ran a good race but her moment passed. Pete Buttigieg clearly has not fared well with minority voters crucial to a winning effort. Elizabeth Warren is running out of options. Biden and Sanders have demonstrated that they can build diverse coalitions critical to success in November. Yet, Sanders has to ask himself some hard questions about why he under-performs with African-American voters, and needs to reach out more to unify the party. Sanders remains the front-runner and the probable nominee if he dominates in California, turns out Latinos in Texas and runs even in the other Super Tuesday states. Bloomberg may assure that with hundreds of millions spent in vain. Art Cullen is editor of The Storm Lake Times in Northwest Iowa, where he won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing. He is a Guardian US columnist and author of the book Storm Lake: Change, Resilience, and Hope in America\u2019s Heartland Lloyd Green: Joe Biden is back \u2013 but this triumph won\u2019t last long Joe Biden is back with a commanding win in South Carolina after defeats in three-straight contests. But now comes Super Tuesday. According to polls, Bernie Sanders holds comfortable leads in delegate rich California and Texas, where early voting is underway. Practically speaking, the former vice president will have little time to enjoy his triumph. As for Saturday\u2019s losers, South Carolina flashed a red light at Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren. Each ran in the low single-digits with black voters. By contrast, Biden beat Sanders with this key demographic by three-to-one. Historically, the Democratic nominee is the candidate who has fared best among the Democrats\u2019 most reliable voting bloc. It was also a bad day for Mike Bloomberg who wasn\u2019t on the ballot. Biden\u2019s convincing win undercut the rationale for the ex-New York City mayor\u2019s candidacy. Biden has proved to be more durable than estimated, and little more than a quarter of South Carolina\u2019s black primary voters view Bloomberg favorably. In all but 1988 and 2004, the winner of the South Carolina primary emerged as the Democratic standard-bearer. In South Carolina, Biden was outspent 40-one. From looks of things, it is now a two-person race: Bernie v Biden. Lloyd Green was opposition research counsel to George HW Bush\u2019s 1988 campaign and served in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992 Benjamin Dixon: \u2018The Democrats remain deeply divided\u2019 The Democratic party is at an impasse that can best be observed by Joe Biden\u2019s overwhelming win in South Carolina. I had the chance to spend the weekend in Columbia, South Carolina. What I found more than anything else was fear of a progressive agenda. Just the mention of the name, \u201cBernie Sanders\u201d turned several voters I spoke with from gentle, almost passive, observers of the election into fierce and staunch opponents to the progressive from Vermont. While I wanted to dismiss my observations as merely being anecdotal, my gut told me otherwise. Before any vote was cast, I knew that South Carolina \u2013 on average \u2013 did not like Bernie Sanders. But as the results came in, and Joe Biden appears to have received his first primary victory in all of his previous attempts, it appears as though both the anecdotal evidence and my instincts were proven correct. South Carolina\u2019s primary voters skewed heavily towards older and more conservative/moderate voters. That group \u2013voters over the age of 45 and those who are seeking a moderate nominee \u2013 have resoundingly rejected Senator Sanders\u2019s vision for America. Which brings us to the great divide in the Democratic party: moderates versus progressives. Moderates cannot win the general election without progressives. Progressives cannot win the general election without moderates. Progressives are increasingly declaring that they will not vote for a moderate. The feeling towards progressives was mutual in South Carolina. We are at an impasse. Can the big tent of the Democratic party continue when progressives are demanding actual, material change while moderates are simultaneously shouting at the top of their lungs, \u201clet\u2019s keep things the same.\u201d The moderates I spoke to in South Carolina had as much a visceral reaction to the name Bernie Sanders as progressives have towards the name Michael Bloomberg. If this division holds, neither progressives nor moderates will be able to build the coalition necessary to defeat Donald Trump in the general election because neither side can win without the other. The real question is, are our competing visions for America irreconcilable differences. For the sake of the nation, I hope they are not.

I\u2019m talking about cooking that emerges from real whole foods, whole flavours that require some crazy women or men to spend the hours, days, if not years preparing it.</p> <p> Makrut lime leaves are a testament to this dedication. You might know them as kaffir lime leaves, but when you learn why that term <a href=\"https://modernfarmer.com/2014/07/getting-rid-k-word/\">is out of favour</a>, you\u2019ll adapt.

There are fewer growers, and even fewer people, who want to pick them. I know, because I\u2019m doing it myself.</p> <p>It\u2019s taken us four years from planting a tube stock to get our first meagre harvest. It took me five hours to pick my first kilogram, and my hands were completely shredded bloody by the thorns.</p> <p>I\u2019ve learned since and have started to grow the grafted thornless variety.</p> <p> A sign that a makrut tree is starting to mature, and you can safely start picking off the leaves without stunting it, is when it has started to develop fruit.</p> <p>And what a weird and wonderful citrus this is.</p> <p> The makrut lime is a knobbly, warty thing; the rind is such a pleasantly strong aromat that once it is removed to be used in curry pastes we often put the peeled fruit into the bathrooms to deodorise the toilet.</p> <p>The juice is so sharply sour and bitter it\u2019s never advisable to substitute for lime \u2013 unless you are cooking something where all the other ingredients are of equal strength so it can harmonise rather than dominate. </p> <p>That is why only the leaves and rind are commonly used. They offer a more delicate version of the fruit, without the sharpness and bitterness.</p> <p>There are occasions, though, when it is entirely appropriate, like in one of my favourite curries, Gaeng Tae Po. Here it is the star ingredient, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/23/morning-glory-or-paak-boong-its-a-splendid-stir-fry-no-matter-the-name\">water spinach</a>.</p> <p>This curry speaks to all my inner ancestral selves, especially as I lick my bowl clean \u2013 leaves, fruit and all.</p> <h2>Gaeng Tae Po \u2013 curry of pork belly, makrut limes and water spinach</h2> <p>Gaeng Tae Po is moreish red paste based, coconut milk curry with pork belly and tamarind. The final flourish that makes the curry sing is freshly halved makrut lime, juice squeezed into the curry then dropped entirely into the pot to infuse.</p> <p><strong>To make the curry paste</strong><em><strong><br></strong></em>10 dry long red chilli, soaked in water for 20 minutes, sliced<strong><br></strong>5 red birds eye chilli<strong><br></strong>1 tsp salt<strong><br></strong>3 pieces galangal, cut into 3cm discs lightly pounded but kept intact<strong><br></strong>2 stalks of lemongrass, cut into 1cm pieces<strong><br></strong>3 red shallots<br>10 cloves garlic<br>1 tbs shrimp paste<br>2 coriander root chopped roughly<br>10 whole white pepper<br>1 makrut lime rind with pith</p> <p><strong>To make the curry</strong><em><strong><br></strong></em>300g washed pastured pork belly, cut into cubes<strong><br></strong>250ml organic coconut cream<strong><br></strong>250ml organic coconut milk<strong><br></strong>1 lge bunch water spinach cut into 1-inch lengths<br>1 makrut lime fruit, halved and deseeded<br>7 makrut lime leaves very finely julienned<br>2tbs fish sauce<br>125ml palm sugar<br>125ml tamarind pulp concentrate<br>1L home-made chicken stock<strong><br></strong><br>In a mortar and pestle pound the rehydrated long red chillis, red birds eye chilli and salt until smooth, then incorporate all the other ingredients \u2013 except the shrimp paste \u2013 and pound until smooth, then add the shrimp paste and pound until well incorporated. Refrigerate to rest.</p> <p>The reason the ingredients go into the paste in this order is to ensure the end product is a vibrant red, and not a dull brownish red.</p> <p>On low heat set a medium soup pot with coconut cream and the fresh curry paste, stirring constantly to keep from burning until the mixture looks like it is \u201ccurdling\u201d \u2013 the fat from the coconut cream will start to separate. This usually takes 10 minutes.</p> <p>Add the pork belly and keep stirring until the mixture covers the pork completely and the pork has caramelised slightly on the outside, then add the coconut milk. Bring up the heat to a soft rolling boil until the curry is slightly reduced, which will take about 10 minutes. Check to make sure the pork is thoroughly cooked through.</p> <p>Season with fish sauce, tamarind, palm sugar, squeeze juice of the makrut lime fruit and then pop the halves into the pot.</p> <p>Add the julienned makrut lime leaves and water spinach. Stir the water spinach in thoroughly until fully immersed, turn off the heat. The greens should still be a lovely vibrant green but have a nice soft bite to them, which will contrast beautifully with the tender pork belly.</p> <p>Serve immediately.<br></p>",

It\u2019s taken us four years from planting a tube stock to get our first meagre harvest. It took me five hours to pick my first kilogram, and my hands were completely shredded bloody by the thorns. I\u2019ve learned since and have started to grow the grafted thornless variety. A sign that a makrut tree is starting to mature, and you can safely start picking off the leaves without stunting it, is when it has started to develop fruit. And what a weird and wonderful citrus this is. The makrut lime is a knobbly, warty thing; the rind is such a pleasantly strong aromat that once it is removed to be used in curry pastes we often put the peeled fruit into the bathrooms to deodorise the toilet. The juice is so sharply sour and bitter it\u2019s never advisable to substitute for lime \u2013 unless you are cooking something where all the other ingredients are of equal strength so it can harmonise rather than dominate. That is why only the leaves and rind are commonly used. They offer a more delicate version of the fruit, without the sharpness and bitterness. There are occasions, though, when it is entirely appropriate, like in one of my favourite curries, Gaeng Tae Po. Here it is the star ingredient, alongside water spinach. This curry speaks to all my inner ancestral selves, especially as I lick my bowl clean \u2013 leaves, fruit and all. Gaeng Tae Po \u2013 curry of pork belly, makrut limes and water spinach Gaeng Tae Po is moreish red paste based, coconut milk curry with pork belly and tamarind. The final flourish that makes the curry sing is freshly halved makrut lime, juice squeezed into the curry then dropped entirely into the pot to infuse. To make the curry paste 10 dry long red chilli, soaked in water for 20 minutes, sliced 5 red birds eye chilli 1 tsp salt 3 pieces galangal, cut into 3cm discs lightly pounded but kept intact 2 stalks of lemongrass, cut into 1cm pieces 3 red shallots 10 cloves garlic 1 tbs shrimp paste 2 coriander root chopped roughly 10 whole white pepper 1 makrut lime rind with pith To make the curry 300g washed pastured pork belly, cut into cubes 250ml organic coconut cream 250ml organic coconut milk 1 lge bunch water spinach cut into 1-inch lengths 1 makrut lime fruit, halved and deseeded 7 makrut lime leaves very finely julienned 2tbs fish sauce 125ml palm sugar 125ml tamarind pulp concentrate 1L home-made chicken stock In a mortar and pestle pound the rehydrated long red chillis, red birds eye chilli and salt until smooth, then incorporate all the other ingredients \u2013 except the shrimp paste \u2013 and pound until smooth, then add the shrimp paste and pound until well incorporated. Refrigerate to rest. The reason the ingredients go into the paste in this order is to ensure the end product is a vibrant red, and not a dull brownish red. On low heat set a medium soup pot with coconut cream and the fresh curry paste, stirring constantly to keep from burning until the mixture looks like it is \u201ccurdling\u201d \u2013 the fat from the coconut cream will start to separate. This usually takes 10 minutes. Add the pork belly and keep stirring until the mixture covers the pork completely and the pork has caramelised slightly on the outside, then add the coconut milk. Bring up the heat to a soft rolling boil until the curry is slightly reduced, which will take about 10 minutes. Check to make sure the pork is thoroughly cooked through. Season with fish sauce, tamarind, palm sugar, squeeze juice of the makrut lime fruit and then pop the halves into the pot. Add the julienned makrut lime leaves and water spinach. Stir the water spinach in thoroughly until fully immersed, turn off the heat. The greens should still be a lovely vibrant green but have a nice soft bite to them, which will contrast beautifully with the tender pork belly. Serve immediately.",

Here\u2019s how tonight\u2019s primary shook out:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Joe Biden got a much-needed shot in the arm. </strong>According to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/feb/29/south-carolina-results-live-primary-vote-tracker-winner-latest\">results</a> as of 11 pm ET, the former vice president defeated <strong>Bernie Sanders </strong>by about 29 points. Biden needed a decisive win here after dismal performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, but the question now is whether the victory will translate into momentum for Super Tuesday. Biden will need to consolidate the moderate vote quickly if he wants to block Sanders\u2019 path to the nomination, and his landslide win could attract voters who were concerned about his ability to defeat <strong>Trump </strong>after Iowa and New Hampshire. </li> <li><strong>The Democratic race is more muddled than ever going into Super Tuesday. </strong>The four early voting states delivered delegate wins to Sanders, Biden and <strong>Pete Buttigieg, </strong>and seven candidates remain in the race. Adding to the confusion, <strong>Mike Bloomberg </strong>will be on the ballot starting Tuesday. But the race could quickly narrow depending on how the 14 Super Tuesday states vote.</li> <li><strong>Paging Bloomberg: Tom Steyer\u2019s $200 million gamble flamed out. </strong>Steyer had staked his presidential campaign on a strong performance in South Carolina, and the billionaire activist dropped out when it became clear that had not materialized, despite spending nearly $200 million on advertising nationally. Bloomberg has spent more than half a billion dollars since entering the race in November, and his first test will come on Tuedsay. But Steyer\u2019s withdrawal does not necessarily foretell success, although Bloombeg is better known and spending much more.</li> <li><strong>The results of Nevada and South Carolina intensify concerns about Iowa and New Hampshire voting first. </strong>The mostly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire, which voted first and second in the Democratic primary, both showed Sanders and Buttigieg in a close fight for the top spot. But then came Nevada and South Carolina, which gave decisive victories to Sanders and Biden. The sharp contrast in results has added to mounting concerns about letting two mostly white states vote first as the Democratic party becomes increasingly diverse.</li> <li><strong>Is this the end of caucuses? </strong>The Iowa caucuses were a complete debacle, as officials took days to report results. Nevada\u2019s caucuses were not as disastrous, although it still took hours for results to slowly trickle in. New Hampshire and South Carolina, two primary states, were able to quickly report statewide results. The glaring discrepancy will certainly spark some calls to end the caucus system in the small handful of states still using it.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for following along with our coverage of the South Carolina primary and tune back in for our regular US politics live blog on Monday.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5b31588f0811db2fb014b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-01T03:52:55.579Z\">3.52am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There will be considerable debate over the next few days about what <strong>Joe Biden</strong>\u2019s victory means for his path to the nomination, but one thing is obvious: <strong>the Democratic race is more muddled than ever.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jonfavs/status/1233962492394491904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In SC, Joe Biden won liberal voters 43-29 AND voters who prefer Medicare for All 44-28. <br><br>In NV, Bernie Sanders tied Biden among moderate and conservative voters. <br><br>Political coverage is probably too focused on lanes and ideological differences.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s tonight\u2019s news story on Joe Biden\u2019s big win in South Carolina: That\u2019s it from me in Columbia, South Carolina. Here\u2019s how tonight\u2019s primary shook out: Joe Biden got a much-needed shot in the arm. According to the results as of 11 pm ET, the former vice president defeated Bernie Sanders by about 29 points. Biden needed a decisive win here after dismal performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, but the question now is whether the victory will translate into momentum for Super Tuesday. Biden will need to consolidate the moderate vote quickly if he wants to block Sanders\u2019 path to the nomination, and his landslide win could attract voters who were concerned about his ability to defeat Trump after Iowa and New Hampshire. The Democratic race is more muddled than ever going into Super Tuesday. The four early voting states delivered delegate wins to Sanders, Biden and Pete Buttigieg, and seven candidates remain in the race. Adding to the confusion, Mike Bloomberg will be on the ballot starting Tuesday. But the race could quickly narrow depending on how the 14 Super Tuesday states vote. Paging Bloomberg: Tom Steyer\u2019s $200 million gamble flamed out. Steyer had staked his presidential campaign on a strong performance in South Carolina, and the billionaire activist dropped out when it became clear that had not materialized, despite spending nearly $200 million on advertising nationally. Bloomberg has spent more than half a billion dollars since entering the race in November, and his first test will come on Tuedsay. But Steyer\u2019s withdrawal does not necessarily foretell success, although Bloombeg is better known and spending much more. The results of Nevada and South Carolina intensify concerns about Iowa and New Hampshire voting first. The mostly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire, which voted first and second in the Democratic primary, both showed Sanders and Buttigieg in a close fight for the top spot. But then came Nevada and South Carolina, which gave decisive victories to Sanders and Biden. The sharp contrast in results has added to mounting concerns about letting two mostly white states vote first as the Democratic party becomes increasingly diverse. Is this the end of caucuses? The Iowa caucuses were a complete debacle, as officials took days to report results. Nevada\u2019s caucuses were not as disastrous, although it still took hours for results to slowly trickle in. New Hampshire and South Carolina, two primary states, were able to quickly report statewide results. The glaring discrepancy will certainly spark some calls to end the caucus system in the small handful of states still using it. Thanks for following along with our coverage of the South Carolina primary and tune back in for our regular US politics live blog on Monday. There will be considerable debate over the next few days about what Joe Biden\u2019s victory means for his path to the nomination, but one thing is obvious: the Democratic race is more muddled than ever. That\u2019s ... interesting. Republican senator Lindsey Graham congratulated Joe Biden after the former vice president secured a decisive victory in Graham\u2019s home state of South Carolina. Biden and Graham worked together in the Senate, but the pair sparred publicly when Graham echoed the president\u2019s baseless corruption allegations against Biden and his son, Hunter. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened\u201d to Graham, Biden told \u201cThe View\u201d earlier this month. Bernie Sanders thanked Tom Steyer for his presidential campaign after the billionaire activist announced he would drop out of the race. Steyer said he did not see a path to victory after his disappointing third-place finish in South Carolina, but he pledged to continue working on issues that mattered to him like racial justice and climate change. Political reporters weigh in on tonight\u2019s results: there\u2019s no question that Joe Biden\u2019s decisive victory in South Carolina has given his campaign a much-needed shot in the arm. But the question now is whether that victory will translate to momentum for Super Tuesday, when 14 states will vote: A New York Times reporter noted Biden\u2019s victory was partly attributable to the rise of moderate candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who failed to attract the support of voters of color: And here\u2019s what to keep an eye on as the nominating contest moves into March: Joe Biden appears to have surpassed Bernie Sanders in the primary-wide popular vote thanks to his large victory in South Carolina. However, Sanders may still lead in pledged delegates, the metric used to determine the party\u2019s nominee, by the end of the night: Tom Steyer may have dropped out of the presidential race, but it should be noted the video from his South Carolina rally last night, in which he danced alongside the rapper Juvenile, will live on forever. Tom Steyer has appeared at his primary night party in Columbia to announce he is dropping out of the presidential race. \u201cWe were disappointed with where we came out,\u201d Steyer said, saying he may have won a couple delegates from South Carolina\u2019s congressional districts. \u201cI said if I didn\u2019t see a path to winning, then I\u2019d suspend my campaign. And honestly, I can\u2019t see a path where I can win the presidency.\u201d Steyer promised to continue working on the issues that animated his campaign, specifically racial justice and climate change. The billionaire activist launched his campaign in July but failed to break through with better-known candidates like Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in the race. Steyer had staked his campaign on South Carolina, where he held more events than any other candidate. But his disappointing third-place finish here left him with no path to the nomination. Billionaire activist Tom Steyer is reportedly dropping out of the presidential race after a disappointing finish in the South Carolina primary. Steyer will appear here at his primary night party in Columbia momentarily. While addressing supporters at his victory party in Columbia, Joe Biden appeared to suffer a slip of the tongue when he briefly identified a Senate candidate as the next president. \u201cNow we need to stand behind Jaime Harrison, the next president of the United \u2014 next senator,\u201d Biden said of Harrison, who is running to oust Republican senator Lindsey Graham. Aside from the verbal hiccup, Biden\u2019s mention of down-ballot candidates like Harrison and freshman congressman Joe Cunningham appeared quite strategic. Some establishment Democrats have expressed fear that the party could lose the House if Bernie Sanders is nominated. Biden\u2019s mentions of Harrison and Cunningham, combined with his promises to keep Nancy Pelosi as House speaker and flip the Republican-controlled Senate, were clearly meant to send a message that he would lead the party to widespread victory if nominated. Joe Biden focused his victory speech on electability, once again claiming that he is the candidate who will defeat Trump. \u201cWe have the option of winning big or losing big,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe need real changes, right now. Something I\u2019ve done my whole career, and I\u2019ll do as president. \u201cWe have to beat Donald Trump and the Republican Party,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe days of Donald Trump\u2019s divisiveness will soon be over.\u201d Joe Biden took a victory lap at his primary night party in Columbia, South Carolina, pointing to his win here as evidence of a comeback in the nominating contest. \u201cThis campaign is taking off,\u201d Biden told a cheering crowd of hundreds. The former vice president made a point to directly address voters in the 14 states that will vote on Super Tuesday. \u201cWe need you, we want you, there\u2019s a place for you in this campaign,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf Democrats nominate me, I believe we can beat Donald Trump.\u201d Congressman Jim Clyburn spoke at Joe Biden\u2019s victory party after the influental lawmaker helped deliver a victory in South Carolina for the former vice president. Clyburn recalled his days teaching history to underscore the importance of this election. \u201cWe study history in order to understand the present. And to prepare for the future,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cBecause anything that\u2019s happened before, can happen again.\u201d The South Carolina congressman then made a direct pitch for Biden\u2019s candidacy. \u201cThis campaign, this year is about the goodness of America,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cAnd we have as our candidate, a real good man.\u201d Someone else who\u2019s not having a good night: Elizabeth Warren. As initial South Carolina results showed Warren in fifth place, the Massachusetts senator was disrupted by a protester while addressing supporters in Houston. Addressing the crowd, Warren, who has so far failed to win a single contest in the presidential primary, acknowledged the early states have not gone as she had hoped. But Warren showed no sign of dropping out, saying she looks forward to Super Tuesday. \u201cMy campaign is built for the long haul, and we are looking forward to these big contests,\u201d Warren told the crowd. Bernie Sanders congratulated Joe Biden on his victory in the South Carolina primary while addressing supporters in Virginia Beach. \u201cYou cannot win \u2018em all,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cA lot of states out there, and tonight we did not win in South Carolina.\u201d The Vermont senator also appeared to be bracing his supporters for a long fight ahead. \u201cThat will not be the only defeat,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThere are a lot of states in this country. Nobody wins them all.\u201d Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has made clear the billionaire candidate will not drop out after Joe Biden\u2019s seemingly decisive victory in the South Carolina primary. \u201cMike Bloomberg has not been on the ballot yet,\u201d campaign manager Kevin Sheekey said in a new statement. \u201cMike is the only candidate to campaign in all fourteen Super Tuesday states over the last two months and we look forward to Tuesday.\u201d Bloomberg skipped the four early voting states to focus on the larger Super Tuesday states, such as California and Texas, but Biden\u2019s win tonight may tarnish the former New York mayor\u2019s argument that he\u2019s the candidate best suited to defeat Trump. We\u2019re still waiting for Biden to deliver his victory speech here at the University of South Carolina\u2019s volleyball center. There\u2019s an air of genuine surprise here about his expected margin of victory. It\u2019s important to remember that Biden was not expected to win here by a convincing margin until a few days ago. As I drove to Columbia from Charleston earlier today, speaking to voters at a few polling stations along the way, it was interesting to hear just how much congressman Jim Clyburn\u2019s endorsement did for Biden among the people I spoke to - many of whom had been considering both Tom Steyer and Elizabeth Warren before Wednesday. Although Biden appears to have done incredibly well among African American voters, the crowd here, which continues to swell, is pretty diverse. I\u2019ve watched a number of Biden staffers embrace as the results keep rolling in and it becomes clear that Biden is going to score not just a decisive victory, but also the lion\u2019s share of the delegates in play here. Joe Biden\u2019s team said his fundraising numbers have spiked since the South Carolina primary was called. According to the former vice president\u2019s director of online fundraising, the campaign saw its best hour of donations after Biden was declared the winner in South Carolina. Bernie Sanders does not appear to have improved his standing much with South Carolina\u2019s African American voters since 2016, when the Vermont senator lost the state\u2019s primary to Hillary Clinton by more than 47 points. Sanders is very popular with other segments of the Democratic Party, including Latinx voters, but his poor numbers with African Americans could drag down his delegate haul on Super Tuesday. Despite the pundit pressure to drop out of the race, Mike Bloomberg is showing no signs of withdrawing after Joe Biden\u2019s seemingly decisive victory in South Carolina. Tom Steyer has not made an appearance at his primary night party yet, as early results indicate a poor showing in South Carolina for the billionaire activist. Steyer had rested all his presidential ambitions on a strong performance in South Carolina, visiting the state more than any other candidate. (His wife even moved to the Palmetto State recently.) But elections experts are currently predicting Steyer may not have picked up a single delegate tonight, leaving the long-shot candidate with no path to the nomination. Some pundits are already calling on Mike Bloomberg to drop out of the race in the hope of Joe Biden consolidating the support of more moderate Democrats. Bloomberg has already spent more than $500 million campaigning in Super Tuesday states like California and Texas. But the former New York mayor\u2019s standing in the race may be slipping after a terrible first debate performance. More importantly, Biden\u2019s seemingly decisive victory in South Carolina may win over some moderate Democrats who questioned the former vice president\u2019s electability after his losses in Iowa and New Hampshire. It has been a tough hour for Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. On top of Joe Biden\u2019s immediate victory in the South Carolina primary, the former vice president has picked up another Super Tuesday endorsement. As expected, former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe has endorsed Biden. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford four more years of Donald Trump\u2019s hate-driven chaos and Joe Biden is the candidate with the character, experience, and broad appeal to defeat him,\u201d McAuliffe said in a statement released by the Biden campaign. And a top newspaper in Minnesota, another Super Tuesday state where Sanders has been competitive, has just endorsed home-state senator Amy Klobuchar. \u201cKlobuchar is the candidate we know best and trust the most,\u201d the Star Tribune\u2019s editorial board wrote. \u201cMost Minnesotans recognize that she has been there on the issues that matter to them \u2014 not just when it\u2019s politically expedient, but day after day, year after year.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign has released a statement criticizing the entire Democratic presidential field, in response to Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the South Carolina primary. \u201cOnce again, President Trump is the clear winner because not one of these candidates has a chance at beating him in November,\u201d campaign manager Brad Parscale said in the statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who the eventual nominee will be, but they are all the same, and their radical big government socialist policies will be on the Democrat ballot in November no matter what,\u201d Parscale said, clearly trying to equate Biden with democratic socialist Bernie Sanders. Joe Biden has won the crucial South Carolina primary, according to early results projections, in a victory that could rejuvenate the former vice president\u2019s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination after poor early results earlier in the month. The Biden campaign has long viewed South Carolina, the first state where African American voters will hold a significant sway in the result, as a way to boost his presidential run after poor early results. Anything less than a convincing victory could have spelled the beginning of the end for Biden. At an election night party in the state capital of Columbia, a crowd that filled the bleachers and playing court of a university volleyball court roared as the result was announced on TV news as the polls closed. Trump has weighed in on Joe Biden\u2019s win in South Carolina, predicting the former vice president\u2019s victory will spell the end of Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign. Bloomberg and Biden have both sought the votes of the more moderate members of the Democratic Party, and it previously appeared Bloomberg had picked off much of Biden\u2019s support. However, after a terrible first debate performance, Bloomberg\u2019s numbers slipped, and Biden\u2019s victory tonight may encourage some of his former supporters to return to the fold before Super Tuesday. Joe Biden has won his first presidential primary after two previous runs for the White House, the first of which was in 1988. So it could be said that the former vice president has been waiting for this night for 32 years. The real question is whether Biden\u2019s success tonight will translate into more wins on Super Tuesday, when more than 1,300 delegates are up for grabs. The answer to that question will likely depend on how much Biden can run up the score tonight, which will become clearer as more results roll in. Joe Biden is likely looking at a massive margin tonight, considering the race was called right as polls closed. This is the first race of the election cycle that has been called as soon as the vote was over. For comparison, New Hampshire, the only other primary so far, took hours to call because of Bernie Sanders\u2019 narrow margin over Pete Buttigieg. Biden needed a decisive victory tonight to reinvigorate his campaign before heading into Super Tuesday, and it appears he got it. The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland is at Joe Biden\u2019s party -- now a victory party -- in Columbia, South Carolina. A massive cheer went up as CNN called the race for the former vice president, and audience members waved American flags as they awaited Biden\u2019s arrival. Well, that was quick. The polls closed moments ago, but AP has projected that Joe Biden has won the South Carolina primary. It is 7 pm ET, so the polls in South Carolina have officially closed, and we will soon start getting results from the last of the four early voting states in the Democratic presidential primary. Jim Clyburn may have endorsed Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy, but the influential South Carolina congressman also has some notes for the former vice president. Clyburn told CNN that, if Biden wins the South Carolina primary tonight, \u201cwe will have to sit down and get serious about how we retool this campaign.\u201d The House majority whip added that \u201cmany of us around the country will be able to join with him and help him get it right\u201d if Biden wins. Considering Biden\u2019s dismal showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, he will need a signficant and rapid reversal of fortunes if he wants to contest frontrunner Bernie Sanders for the nomination. Here\u2019s some more good news for Joe Biden from South Carolina exit polls: the state\u2019s primary voters are showing a desire to return to a pre-Trump era of politics. According to an AP Votecast poll, about 4 in 10 South Carolina voters say they want to return to the politics of the past. In comparison, about two-thirds of voters in Iowa and New Hamoshire, where Biden saw dismal performances, said they wanted a candidate who would bring fundamental change to Washington. Biden has based his campaign on a promise that he would restore normalcy to the White House, while progressive candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have promised to enact radical change through policies like Medicare-for-all and student loan forgiveness. If a higher share of South Carolina\u2019s voters are feeling nostalgic for the days of Barack Obama, it could bode well for Biden\u2019s showing tonight. I\u2018m at Joe Biden\u2019s election night party at the University of South Carolina Volleyball Center in Columbia. The press pen, which stretches across half the arena, is already completely packed, and the event isn\u2019t set to start for another half an hour. A diverse crowd of what seems like a few hundred people snakes for about half a block outside, and Biden\u2019s \u201cSoul of the Nation\u201d campaign bus sits on the roadside catching the sunset. The sound system is being checked at the moment, with a few songs indicating how confident the campaign is of a victory tonight. The disco anthem \u201cAin\u2019t No Stopping Us Now\u201d by McFadden &amp; Whitehead and \u201cCelebrate!\u201d by Kool &amp; The Gang have both been played. Biden\u2019s campaign have erected a podium in the middle of the court, indicating he\u2019ll be speaking in the round when he comes out after results start coming in around 7pm ET. Here at Tom Steyer\u2019s primary night party in Columbia, South Carolina, supporters of the billionaire activist are starting to trickle in. Polls close in about 20 minutes, so Steyer will soon know whether or not his decision to focus his early campaigning efforts on South Carolina has paid off. If it hasn\u2019t, the bar at his primary night party will likely come in handy for his team. Coming off his landslide victory in Nevada, Bernie Sanders\u2019 team had recently appeared confident he would do well in South Carolina. \u201cWe are closing that gap every day,\u201d Sanders said of Joe Biden\u2019s polling advantage on Thursday. \u201cIf we can close that gap here, I think we will do well on Super Tuesday, and then win the Democratic nomination.\u201d But the Vermont senator has not mentioned the primary today as he campaigns in Super Tuesday states, indicating he may be bracing for a loss. Tom Steyer has based all his presidential hopes on South Carolina, and he needs to do well tonight to stay in the race. Steyer has been campaigning across the state for months and picking up endorsements from a number of local leaders. His wife even moved here recently. The billionaire activist even went viral yesterday with some questionable dance moves alongside the rapper Juvenile at a rally in Columbia: But polls have shown Steyer trailing Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, so depending on the results, tonight could mark the end of his long-shot campaign. Joe Biden could be in for a good night thanks to the endorsement of South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn. Clyburn, the longest-serving member of South Carolina\u2019s congressional delegation and the highest-ranking African-American in the House, has incredible clout in the state. Clyburn endorsed Biden on Wednesday, and that late-stage support may be critical tonight. Joe Biden could take the delegate lead in the Democratic primary tonight, depending on the size of his potential victory in South Carolina. The Palmetto State is the most delegate-rich of the four early voting states. For perspective, Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada have awarded a collective 101 delegates, and 54 delegates are up for grabs in South Carolina tonight. If Biden wins by more than 20 points in a high-turnout primary, he could take the lead over Bernie Sanders in pledged delegates and potentially the popular vote. But Sanders has built a 30-delegate lead over Biden, so the former vice president would need a landslide to pull ahead of the frontrunner. Greetings from Columbia, South Carolina! Voters in this state have been going to the polls all day to decide which Democratic presidential candidate should face off against Donald Trump in November. Joe Biden is the heavy favorite to win tonight, with the RealClearPolitics polling average showing him leading second-place Bernie Sanders by more than 15 points. The former vice president has benefitted from his popularity among African-American voters, who make up more than half of South Carolina\u2019s primary electorate. Biden needs a victory tonight to reinvigorate his campaign after dismal performances in Iowa and New Hampshire and a distant second-place finish in Nevada. Sanders, the frontrunner in the Democratic primary, is unlikely to win tonight, but he\u2019s looking to mitigate Biden\u2019s gains to avoid any questions about his electability before Super Tuesday, when more than 1,300 delegates will be up for grabs. A wildcard tonight is Tom Steyer, the billionaire activist who has based the future of his campaign on South Carolina after finishing in the low single digits in the first three voting states. Recent polls have shown Steyer in third place behind Biden and Sanders, but he is hoping to slip into second place. If Steyer can\u2019t turn in a solid performance tonight, it could end his campaign. For the lower-polling candidates, a disappointing showing could spell trouble for Super Tuesday, when they will need to do well to stay in the race. The polls will close in about an hour and a half at 7 pm ET, so stay tuned.",

      "body": "<p>Joe Biden desperately needed a big win. Frankly the former vice-president needed any win at all, having won precisely zero states in three presidential campaigns. So he hugged South Carolina like a life raft for his drowning campaign.</p> <p>\u201cTo all those of you who have been knocked down, counted out, this is your campaign,\u201d he declared. \u201cNow thanks to all of you \u2013 the heart of the Democratic party \u2013 we\u2019ve won big because of you. And we are very much alive.\u201d</p> <p>This is a less-than-subtle slap at pundits and columnists like this one, who previously described Biden\u2019s campaign \u2013 just last week, in fact \u2013 as having all the vital signs of the living dead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-x7He2nE0o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G-x7He2nE0o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Joe Biden delivers victory speech </figcaption> </figure>   <p>But one sign of life doesn\u2019t stop the calamity heading Biden\u2019s way in just three days, when one third of the delegates will be decided on Super Tuesday.</p> <p>For Biden to turn this contest around, his big win in South Carolina needs to dominate the news cycle across all the huge media markets in California day after day after day. In a largely non-political state, at a time of widespread concerns about the corona virus, that won\u2019t be easy for any campaign.</p> <p>But even that won\u2019t be enough. He also needs to convince other moderates to drop out in the next couple of days. They need to tell the voters they\u2019re out before they cast their ballots \u2013 because the ballots themselves are already printed.</p> <p>The omens aren\u2019t good for either scenario. If the Biden campaign is hoping for some giant new momentum in this election, they should just look at the experience of Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign four years ago.</p> <p>Sanders won 23 states in 2016 but he didn\u2019t take one of the big states like California, New York or Texas. He lost the delegate count by more than 300, which was not a trivial number, despite his many complaints about the party and the process.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t the only candidate who won several states but still lost comprehensively. On the Republican side, you might think that Donald Trump swept the entire race, not least because Trump keeps saying that he did. But Ted Cruz, the strangely sociopathic Texas senator, won 11 states before promptly fading into irrelevance and Trumpian sycophancy.</p> <p>So what will it take for Biden to turn around this contest?</p> <p>First, the Biden team discovered on Saturday how to talk about its own reason for being. There is now a frame for the remainder of the primaries that anyone can understand.</p> <p>\u201cIf the Democrats want a nominee who\u2019s a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat, join us,\u201d Biden told his supports in Columbia, South Carolina. \u201cWe have the option of winning big or losing big. That\u2019s the choice.\u201d</p> <p>However, while Biden makes his case for winning big, his rival will actually be winning big.</p> <p>After Super Tuesday, a large delegate lead for Bernie Sanders \u2013 of more than 100, for instance \u2013 will be hard to overcome through the primaries. That kind of lead will be even harder to overcome through the convention, where the party\u2019s superdelegates can tip the nomination if no candidate wins an absolute majority in the first ballot.</p> <p>So the shape of this race comes down to California, where the most recent polls on Friday gave Sanders a lead of between 16 and 21 points over his closest rival there, Elizabeth Warren. For Biden to overcome that kind of advantage would be, as Biden himself likes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2010/mar/23/joe-biden-obama-big-fucking-deal-overheard\">say</a>, a BFD.</p> <p>The Biden campaign might be tempted to keep a split field for some time, with Amy Klobuchar beating Sanders in Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren tying up Sanders in Massachusetts. But a split race means Biden is still lagging Sanders by a wide margin.</p> <p>It\u2019s not impossible for Biden to even out what is likely to be a Sanders blowout in California and a reasonable Sanders win in Texas. He could sweep the rest of the south \u2013 Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Tennessee \u2013 to balance out Bernie\u2019s big win out west.</p> <p>But that scenario would point to a deeply divided Democratic party whose schism would separate the left and center all the way through to the convention.

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden desperately needed a big win. Frankly the former vice-president needed any win at all, having won precisely zero states in three presidential campaigns. So he hugged South Carolina like a life raft for his drowning campaign. \u201cTo all those of you who have been knocked down, counted out, this is your campaign,\u201d he declared. \u201cNow thanks to all of you \u2013 the heart of the Democratic party \u2013 we\u2019ve won big because of you. And we are very much alive.\u201d This is a less-than-subtle slap at pundits and columnists like this one, who previously described Biden\u2019s campaign \u2013 just last week, in fact \u2013 as having all the vital signs of the living dead. But one sign of life doesn\u2019t stop the calamity heading Biden\u2019s way in just three days, when one third of the delegates will be decided on Super Tuesday. For Biden to turn this contest around, his big win in South Carolina needs to dominate the news cycle across all the huge media markets in California day after day after day. In a largely non-political state, at a time of widespread concerns about the corona virus, that won\u2019t be easy for any campaign. But even that won\u2019t be enough. He also needs to convince other moderates to drop out in the next couple of days. They need to tell the voters they\u2019re out before they cast their ballots \u2013 because the ballots themselves are already printed. The omens aren\u2019t good for either scenario. If the Biden campaign is hoping for some giant new momentum in this election, they should just look at the experience of Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign four years ago. Sanders won 23 states in 2016 but he didn\u2019t take one of the big states like California, New York or Texas. He lost the delegate count by more than 300, which was not a trivial number, despite his many complaints about the party and the process. He wasn\u2019t the only candidate who won several states but still lost comprehensively. On the Republican side, you might think that Donald Trump swept the entire race, not least because Trump keeps saying that he did. But Ted Cruz, the strangely sociopathic Texas senator, won 11 states before promptly fading into irrelevance and Trumpian sycophancy. So what will it take for Biden to turn around this contest? First, the Biden team discovered on Saturday how to talk about its own reason for being. There is now a frame for the remainder of the primaries that anyone can understand. \u201cIf the Democrats want a nominee who\u2019s a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat, join us,\u201d Biden told his supports in Columbia, South Carolina. \u201cWe have the option of winning big or losing big. That\u2019s the choice.\u201d However, while Biden makes his case for winning big, his rival will actually be winning big. After Super Tuesday, a large delegate lead for Bernie Sanders \u2013 of more than 100, for instance \u2013 will be hard to overcome through the primaries. That kind of lead will be even harder to overcome through the convention, where the party\u2019s superdelegates can tip the nomination if no candidate wins an absolute majority in the first ballot. So the shape of this race comes down to California, where the most recent polls on Friday gave Sanders a lead of between 16 and 21 points over his closest rival there, Elizabeth Warren. For Biden to overcome that kind of advantage would be, as Biden himself likes to say, a BFD. The Biden campaign might be tempted to keep a split field for some time, with Amy Klobuchar beating Sanders in Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren tying up Sanders in Massachusetts. But a split race means Biden is still lagging Sanders by a wide margin. It\u2019s not impossible for Biden to even out what is likely to be a Sanders blowout in California and a reasonable Sanders win in Texas. He could sweep the rest of the south \u2013 Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Tennessee \u2013 to balance out Bernie\u2019s big win out west. But that scenario would point to a deeply divided Democratic party whose schism would separate the left and center all the way through to the convention. It would be exceptionally difficult to create any sense of unity at that point, at the Milwaukee convention in mid-July. The only person who could bring the party together is sitting in the Oval Office watching cable news. If there is a single, unifying force for Democrats it is their overwhelming, burning desire to dump Donald Trump. For his part, Sanders showed no sign of backing out of Virginia, where he spoke to his supporters as his big South Carolina defeat became clear. \u201cI am very proud that in this campaign so far we have won the popular vote in Iowa. We have won the New Hampshire primary. We have won the Nevada caucus,\u201d Sanders said in Virginia Beach. \u201cBut you cannot win them all. There are a lot of states out there and tonight we did not win in South Carolina. And that won\u2019t be the only defeat.\u201d As it happens, defeat is exactly what Joe Biden wants to talk about too: defeat at the tiny hands of Trump. \u201cWe have to beat Donald Trump and the Republican party, but we can\u2019t become like them,\u201d Biden said on Saturday. \u201cWe have to get back up. The country is so ready.\u201d South Carolina certainly helped Biden to get back up. We\u2019ll know in three days if the rest of the country is ready to do the same.

      "bodyText": "Australia has recorded its first death from Covid-19 after authorities confirmed a man in his late 70s died at a Perth hospital on Sunday. The Western Australian chief health officer, Andrew Robertson, said the man was in an intensive care unit when he died in the early hours of Sunday morning. The man\u2019s wife was diagnosed with the coronavirus a few days ago and is now in a stable condition, he added. Asked if the man\u2019s age or prior health had been a factor, Robertson noted people of his age were more \u201clikely to have other chronic conditions\u201d which could make it harder to fight off the disease. The man was diagnosed at Howard Springs, Northern Territory, about 10 days ago. \u201cThere is no risk to general community or to staff,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cHe was in a negative pressure room and then in intensive care.\u201d The couple were among more than 150 Australians who were isolated on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The man\u2019s family had managed to speak with him on Saturday night through an isolation window before his death on Sunday morning. Robertson said he was concerned about people panicking, saying \u201cwe need to make the point very clear there isn\u2019t community spread in Australia\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything for the status of coronavirus,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cWe always knew it would be a serious virus, especially for the elderly.\u201d \u201cThis very tragic case is related to the Diamond Princess, so the community shouldn\u2019t be panicking at this stage,\u201d he added. Confirmation of the first Australian death came as the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said it was \u201cnot possible\u201d to extend a travel ban to all countries affected by the rapidly spreading coronavirus, as he defended the government\u2019s decision to restrict travel from Iran, but not South Korea where more cases have been reported. With the government preparing for a global pandemic of the virus and fresh cases of exposure being reported on the Gold Coast and New South Wales over the weekend from people returning from Iran, Dutton said the government believed Iran should be included in the ban because the data coming out of the country was not reliable. \u201cIf you look at the underreporting or the lack of reporting coming out of Iran to start with \u2026 there was a real concern as to whether they had a handle on the numbers,\u201d Dutton told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday. \u201cObviously, South Korea has a more advanced health system and they have been reporting numbers for a period of time. So I think they are key differences between those different markets,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the chief medical officer has pointed out, it\u2019s not possible to extend the ban to every country, and we\u2019ll see what phase we move into next.\u201d There have been 388 cases of the virus reported out of Iran, compared to 2,300 in South Korea, but Iran has recorded 43 of the 106 deaths that have occurred outside of China. Worldwide, more than 85,000 are reported to have the virus, with more than 2,900 deaths across 58 countries. On Sunday, a man in his 40s who had recently travelled to Iran became the fifth person in NSW to be diagnosed with the coronavirus, and the second diagnosed after recent travel to Iran. A Gold Coast woman is the other case, with health authorities attempting to track down about 40 people who attended appointments with the 63-year-old beautician at the Hair Plus salon at Australia Fair at Southport before she was diagnosed with the virus and isolated. The new travel restrictions, announced on Sunday, will mean Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family will be required to self-isolate at home for 14 days from the day they left Iran, while foreign nationals will be banned from entering Australia for 14 days since they left the country. The NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said travellers from Iran needed to be \u201cparticularly vigilant\u201d for symptoms, given the rapid increase in the virus activity in recent days. The travel ban also remains in place for China, with the decision preventing the arrival of an estimated 4,000 Chinese foreign nationals each day. The tourism and education sectors are most affected. The health minister, Greg Hunt, has asked the Australian health protection principal committee to consider whether the government has the appropriate level of travel advice in place for Italy, which has seen an outbreak of the virus and so far recorded eight deaths. \u201cI have specifically asked them today to consider whether or not the current arrangements need to be changed in any way, shape or form,\u201d he said.",
